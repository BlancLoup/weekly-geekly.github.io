Games with time</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The dream of many of my friends and acquaintances to have more time.  What, the second question.  Someone needs time for a family, someone for a favorite job, someone for rest.  But time is the resource that we all lack.  I managed to compress the time and get in a day, first ten minutes extra, then an hour, then a few more hours.  For ten years, time has been compressed so that in my day for about 48 hours.  In a week I manage to do as much as many people in two, three, or even a month.  Without prejudice to personal life, quality of work, not with the help of sleepless nights and constant hands-on hands.  In a small note I will try to outline the main points of the system to which I adhere, how it helps me, what strengths and strengths there are in it.  To explain all the tricks and tricks, you will need more than one material, consider this note as an introductory one.  If you like it, and you say that you want to read the sequel, it will appear. <br><br>  At the time of writing, I realized that the text is huge, so for now I‚Äôm giving the first piece.  Otherwise, it will be hard to read. <br><br>  <b>Time is not only a physical quantity, but also a psychological one.</b>

      Each of us has a watch and we are used to the fact that time surrounds us in everyday life.  We wake up on an alarm clock by a certain time, the TV schedule is tied to specific hours, even stores operate at certain hours.  And since childhood, most of us begin to consider time to be unchangeable.  However, time is also a psychological parameter.  The same events can occupy different periods of time in our consciousness, but in real life they will take exactly one minute.  Time in each of us flows at different speeds and depends on our psychological perception.  We adjust our perception of time to external reference points (time grid), but with varying degrees of success. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For some, this statement is obvious and trite, someone is ready to start arguing with him.  I will try to give a few examples that show that time is not permanent in our mind.  Common examples that are not measurable are obvious.  Joyful events fly as one moment, only yesterday we went on vacation, and today we are already packing our bags in the opposite way.  I liked the book, got into the taste, and the pages ran out.  For unnerving, sad events, the course of time is different, we want to run away from them, but like flies in a cobweb we get stuck in the dimensional flow of time, the day does not want to end, nothing pleases us.  But these are examples that will not convince die-hard materialists, despite their obviousness. <br><br>  A couple of years ago, I had an idea how to check the relativity of each person‚Äôs internal clock.  In a small hotel on the seashore, there was a walkway from the main building through the forest and the park to the sea.  From the hotel‚Äôs steps to the entrance to the large park, the road took 15 minutes to walk, and various paths continued to the beach.  On the way there were no places that would attract attention, forced to stop.  An ideal place for my experiment.  I asked a few campers to help me with the following.  Everyone had their own favorite road to the beach.  My task was to measure how long each person took this path (he gave the phone with a GPS receiver, the man himself did not measure anything).  In the evening, everyone talked about how long he traveled to the beach on his way.  Within 3 days, these measurements continued.  Subjective time for five people was equal or conditional equal to objective.  The road took from 15 to 25 minutes, people estimated their time spent adequately. <br>  In the next three days, I asked to use any path to the sea, except for my beloved and become familiar.  This is where miracles began to happen.  On the first day, everyone estimated that the time to the beach increased (on average by 25 percent).  On the second day, it was higher by 20 percent, and on the third day, it became almost equal to the path along the favorite track.  The GPS program readings claimed the opposite, the path to the beach did not increase in time, the speed of movement of each participant in the experiment remained the same.  Both for the first and the third time, all participants in the experiment followed the new paths in the same way, but their perception of time was very different. <br><br>  What is the reason?  It turns out that, passing along a new path, we often cannot, without looking at the clock, objectively estimate the time spent, or do not become attached to a known time grid, for example, that you walked right after the transfer of news, but reached back to the cartoons (this so for most people).  Why such a simple task causes such different evaluations. <br><br>  My explanation, which is obtained intuitively, has no scientific substantiation and does not pretend to it.  While traveling along a new road, we study things subconsciously around us.  It acts apart from us our consciousness.  It remembers trees, objects around, soil unevenness (aha, here is a snag, we must take it to the right next time).  Man is not capable of getting rid of this unconditioned reflex.  If something scares you half to death, then you will rush forward without dismantling the roads, and hardly returning, remember that you were running here (the fear must be very strong, 99 percent of people do not experience this in their entire life). <br><br>  My experiment continued, I asked people to walk along the same paths.  And then it turned out that during the rain, their path either increases or decreases.  Subjective time spent on the road.  Real time did not change at all, the difference went on for seconds.  The speed of movement was the same (thanks to GPS).  The perception of time was influenced by external factors, in our case, rain.  Unfortunately, I did not succeed in continuing that experiment, but the results obtained are curious and are confirmed by my observations of their performance.  Pleasant tasks are solved faster than unpleasant ones.  While playing, you spend hours unnoticed, rather than cleaning a house, when each room takes hours, and in fact, tens of minutes.  To confirm my guesses about the fact that time is subjectively perceived differently, I conducted other experiments, both with my friends and strangers.  But let me omit their description, so as not to go away from our main topic. <br><br>  Below, we are talking about how to ensure that your psychological, internal time is expanded within one day.  The fight against the laws of physics is useless, but it is within the power of most of us to deceive our own organism and consciousness.  And to achieve that in our day will be 48 hours.  Or 30. Or 25. Everyone can choose their own size and their own comfortable rhythm of life. <br><br>  <b>Physiology and several important conventions</b> <br><br>  It does not matter if you are a lark or, on the contrary, an owl, it does not matter for the advice I have set out.  The main thing is that you maintain a healthy sleep, your mood, fatigue and many other equally important parameters of the body depend on it.  Lack of sleep for work, it is force majeure, which must be avoided by any available methods.  In the modern world, it is not always possible, but it is worth striving for it.  If you have a chronic sleep deprivation, then set aside reading this note, and begin by having a good sleep and with a light head, continue reading. <br>  Any disease is not the norm for the body, therefore, it can affect your mood, the desire to work, the ability to do something.  Even in the image of your thoughts.  Therefore, your efficiency on such days should be lower than usual.  Many people forget this banal, common truth. <br><br>  To complete the topic of physiology, let me share a little secret.  To activate your body, make it work at maximum speed, just skip your lunch and dinner.  Your activity, both physical and mental, will increase.  But the fee will be a small breakdown after the first meal.  This trick can be useful on separate, important days when you have to be in the maximum form.  But besides him, there are no secrets that any person could not use to organize his working day more effectively.  Let's get started <br>  <b>To-do list - archaic form</b> <br>  You are a modern person, sure of it.  You have a phone, and there is not one to-do list in it that you can enter, set warnings, and synchronize with your work program.  Someone uses such opportunities, someone does not.  But, in my opinion, the to-do list is an extremely effective thing, but not in electronic form.  I will try to justify this idea, and come from afar. <br><br>  Have you been holding such an archaic object as a fountain pen for a long time?  How long have you written something on paper?  If you are not a student or a teacher, then I put on what you write a little.  Signed here and there, a couple of sentences and all.  However, the entire first part of life only teaches us what to write.  In our head is formed the relationship between what we write and what we memorize.  Someone better developed such a relationship, someone worse.  But it exists, even if you have not used a pen for ten years after school. <br><br>  Comparing how we memorize the text entered on the computer and what is written by hand, will win the second method.  With one proviso, you write what interests you, what concerns you.  If you compare a set of phrases without any meaning, then there is no difference in the way you do it.  This is the first reason to write your to-do list for today, not on your phone or computer, but on a piece of paper that lies on your desktop. <br><br>  Another reason is that you should always see the to-do list, let it lie on the edge of your main papers, but involuntarily you will glance at it.  This is an additional plus.  In the phone or computer, you need to display a to-do list on the screen, or it appears itself when an event occurs.  This is a kind of closed book.  Your leaf, this is an open book, with available information. <br><br>  They did the job, immediately crossed it out, on its list.  Visually and simply.  Does it work?  Yes, if you train yourself to make such a list of affairs correctly.  What I put in the word correctly, I will tell further. <br>  The biggest mistake is to try to put all your business on such a list.  This is utopia and never worked.  You should always highlight priority cases, as well as what you are really capable of doing during the day.  No need to put Napoleonic plans, this is a disastrous way.  If you have a large project, (let's call it, for example, building a castle), then you do not need to specify it without decryption.  You are not able to complete such a project instantly, so write what you are going to do in reality.  For example, draw a picture of the walls for my castle.  Or choose parquet for the castle.  Split big things into small parts.  This will help you make your schedule. <br><br>  You can not go into very small things.  Be sensible.  You will not enter in your to-do list, cleaning shoes before going out, as well as the fact that you need to feed the fish in the aquarium.  These are derivative matters, ordinary and everyday things.  Cut them off, they should not occupy your consciousness, should occur automatically (all routine things should not fall into your list). <br><br>  Never specify how much time it takes you to do this or that.  Unfortunately, this is a sign of electronic organizers.  The case may take 30 minutes or be all day.  Neither is wrong.  You are free to start and finish the case when you want.  Do not set yourself artificial restrictions.  After all, if you do not have time to enter your business in one hour, then you will be upset.  This will result in your productivity falling and you cannot complete other tasks as quickly as you would like. <br><br>  It is not necessary to indicate in the list the order of cases, this is a normal list.  You can start with the first case, but then go to the last one in the list and jump in the middle.  It depends on your desire, not the list guides your actions, but you choose what you are interested in doing now. <br>  Making a list, assess your health.  Do not engage in self-deception.  If you understand that a trip to the grandmother is needed, but you are extremely reluctant to spend time on this, then do not add to the list.  Do this thing well.  But if suddenly not, then it will remain a silent reproach.  Our task is to make it pleasant for you to enter a to-do list and this has become a common practice.  And this can be achieved only in one way.  When you add to the list those cases that actually do during the day and most of the items on the list will be crossed out.  This will prove the validity of the list of cases. <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Ufff.  Sorry, but here I need to interrupt my story, which hung in the air.  In the sequel, I will talk about the pipeline at the factory and parallel (no, not calculations, but cases), this is a method that allows you to achieve tasks quickly and efficiently.  Also, a couple of words about motivation, about self-deception, which is so pleasant and how to evaluate your productivity and quality of work.  Not without the protection of office workers and their ability to be independent.
