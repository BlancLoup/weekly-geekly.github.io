      First, we with like-minded friends organized the Robotics Development Club at the Ural Federal University, then I started teaching Industrial Robotics and others at the university, 2 years ago we managed to establish the Laboratory for the Development of Robotics at the UrFU Mechanical Engineering Institute. <br><br>  Video about our laboratory: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NNilpN1BrZ0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj9lPt9UK3I79ofdwdJxplemVvAoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For several years, my colleagues and I led a robotics club in the Gymnasium Mentality, Yekaterinburg.  From this experience arose the understanding that you need a quality mass education on this topic. <br>  Now there are plans to open a specialty of magistracy, and then a bachelor degree in mechatronics and robotics at the mechanical faculty of UrFU. <br><br>  Taking into account the trend of the time, they decided that it was necessary to make e-courses - accessible to everyone, anywhere, anytime. <br><br>  To this end, we have developed a project with a group of enthusiasts to create a basic set of learning results necessary for minimal education in the field of robotics.  Then they laid them out on courses - it turned out that in order to make an electronic curriculum on robotics for 4 years, you need to make 28 electronic courses. <br><br>  At first they were frightened, then they decided - the eyes are afraid, the hands are doing. <br><br>  In the past year, we first tried on the role of developers of electronic courses. <br>  All year we tried to master this new direction.  Something turns out, but we know for sure that in order to make a worthwhile thing, we need the attitude of interested people. <br><br>  At the moment we are completing work on a large-scale Internet project, the test drive of Hi-Tech <a href="http://openedu.urfu.ru/courses/UrFU/i-testdrive_01/2014/about">‚ÄúMechatronics and Robotics‚Äù</a> , which combines several parts of different electronic courses that we did this year: 3D modeling and drawing in SolidWorks, Electronics at Arduino Programming in ROS, Flying robots and others. <br><br>  In the Ural Federal University, an idea arose - to enable schoolchildren and junior students to take an introductory course in robotics and mechatronics.  After a long discussion of the main direction of the introductory course, we chose one of the projects being implemented in our laboratory - the ‚Äúrope walker‚Äù.  "Rope" is a robotic complex for the diagnosis of high-voltage overhead power lines <br><br>  We offer students and everyone in the e-course with us to join in the finalization of the flying robot. <br>  We decided to take one of our current projects - the robotic complex for the diagnosis of high-voltage overhead power lines ‚ÄúRope-runner‚Äù. <br><br>  Video about the project: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hywga1fVYOs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhbbf6bm8qzTGbmdJRrCVr6HR_OKw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We are interested to involve schoolchildren in joint development.  We set them our current tasks, on which we work ourselves - for example, to develop an algorithm for processing laser scanner data for building a 3D card or to refine the autonomous docking algorithm of a flying robot with a ground wire or power line of the transmission line. <br><br>  Here is a link to the installation video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/cydZiMJpsDs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhgMbP9yVQ9EfrSMz8oo_xudwTkuA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The goal of the ‚ÄúHi-Tech-DRIVE‚Äù project is to create cognitive and professional motivation for technical specialties through the study of electronics, programming and robotics, aimed at mastering the basic principles of working with engineering, electronics and programming. <br><br>  Carrying out the project, the participants will get acquainted with the basics of designing and programming robots, learn how to control them using remote technologies. <br><br>  Form of work - project work in groups aimed at creating a hybrid of a flying and mobile robot to perform an engineering task: diagnostics of high-voltage overhead power lines.  The group will have to refine the 3D model of a real robotic complex, make a project of a new node or part, write a program for controlling a flying robot, calculate the economy and publish an advertising brochure. <br><br>  The product of the work will be a modified real-world robotic complex, its 3D model, an electronic circuit, an autonomous control program for an air-based robot, an unmanned copter, developed in a special simulator on the project website. <br><br>  According to the results of the work, the best participants will receive a certificate for the passage of electronic courses on robotics at Ural Federal University and all participants will be invited to an excursion to the laboratory of robotics at Ural Federal University with the ability to control real robots. <br><br>  Appeal to the Community - help make a really cool course!  I ask those who are not indifferent to register on the website <a href="http://openedu.urfu.ru/courses/UrFU/i-testdrive_01/2014/about">openedu.urfu.ru/courses/UrFU/i-testdrive_01/2014/about</a> <br>  and together with our students go through it - to identify errors, to understand how to fix them. <br>  And how to make a really useful resource for professional orientation and joint development.  I am sure it will be interesting not only for schoolchildren. <br><br>  Let's make a high-quality education in robotics together. <br><br>  Robots are your future! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248105/</a></p>
