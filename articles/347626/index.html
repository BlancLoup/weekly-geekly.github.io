  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Object modeling</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Written with participation of Igor Katrychek katrichek@gmail.com </p><br><h2 id="vvedenie">  Introduction </h2><br><p>  4-D volume, its projections and interpretation <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/347218/">should be consistent with each other</a> .  In order to understand how they can be used to model what we usually understand by an object, consider our idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan object. </p><br><p>  The object can be defined in three ways: </p><br><ol><li>  As the volume enclosed within the surface. </li><li>  As a result of the design synthesis: the village as an object is the synthesis of the village houses. </li><li>  As a result of the analysis of the design: the antenna is part of the missile guidance complex. </li></ol><br><h2 id="obekt-kak-obem">  Object as volume </h2><br><p>  The object in the mind of the subject is not a static frozen picture.  The object moves, changes.  But we will begin by tradition with a static object. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Usually we imagine a 3-D object like this: a surface and something unknown inside it.  The ability to imagine the surface of 3-D volume due to our stereoscopic vision.  We have two eyes capable of building a stereo pair, and a special processing algorithm.  In practical problems of modeling surfaces build as many projections as required.  The number of projections determines the ability to distinguish the details of the surface.  Modern methods allow to model surfaces using vectors (in fact, deltas), which greatly saves resources. </p><br><p>  To create an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe surface dynamics, we compare stereo pairs separated in time.  We can increase or decrease the time between shots, showing details, or, conversely, summarizing our view.  Modern films show us this way of modeling surfaces.  At some point in time, the plot stops, and the camera starts moving around the scene, changing the viewing angle (different projections of the same surface are built). </p><br><p>  In projection modeling, this kind of design can be modeled in the following ways: </p><br><ol><li>  With the help of a temporary structure consisting of a "finite" number of temporary structures, each of which can be interpreted as the transition of an object from one position to the next.  At the same time, to ensure coherence between positions, the final position of one transition coincides with the initial position of another transition. </li><li>  With the help of a temporary structure consisting of a "finite" number of time intervals, each of which can be interpreted as the position of an object.  At the same time, to ensure coherence between positions, the sequence of positions is determined by a sequence of intervals in time. </li><li>  With the help of a temporary substance consisting of an "infinite" number of temporary structures, each of which can be interpreted as the transition of an object from one position to the next.  At the same time, to ensure coherence between positions, the final position of one transition coincides with the initial position of another transition. </li><li>  With the help of a time substance consisting of an "infinite" number of time intervals, each of which can be interpreted as the position of an object.  At the same time, to ensure connectivity between positions, the sequence of positions is determined by a sequence of intervals in time. </li></ol><br><p>  In the chapter on modeling functions, we will see that the last two methods are ways of modeling a function.  In fact, in this way we determined the function of the existence of an object. </p><br><h2 id="obekt-kak-rezultat-sinteza-ili-rezultat-analiza">  Object as a result of synthesis or result of analysis </h2><br><p>  The object can be synthesized based on the concept of structure.  For example, you can say: this set of houses is called the village.  Modeling such an object is reduced to the modeling of the structure.  Or it can be said that the antenna is part of a target detection installation.  How to model such a definition of an object, I do not know yet. </p><br><p>  It turns out that there are criteria for selecting an object.  We select it based on meeting one or more criteria: </p><br><ol><li>  Shape recognition </li><li>  Recognition of the composition or design </li><li>  Saving space in the design </li></ol><br><h2 id="svyaz-mezhdu-obektom-ego-konstrukciey-i-konstrukciey-v-kotoroyu-on-vklyuchen">  The relationship between the object, its structure and the structure in which it is included </h2><br><p>  The object as a volume is connected with the object as a construction only in the consciousness of the subject.  When we say: "an object and its construction", we connect these two views only by the fact that it seems to us that such a construction explains the properties of an object as a volume.  There is no objective connection between an object, a structure, and a structure, of which the object is a part. </p><br><h2 id="predubezhdeniya">  Preconceptions </h2><br><p>  To simulate objects, two biases must be overcome.  The first is that the object is real, because its material composition is constant.  It is enough to recall an object such as a fire hose through which water flows to understand that this is not the case.  But the water hose has a recognizable shape.  The second prejudice - we think that objects should be dense and continuous.  By density, I mean the impossibility of two objects being in one place of space.  But as the gases mix, so the objects mix as well.  Objects can be transparent to each other.  Continuity is associated with the idea that the object should smoothly move in space.  Overcoming this prejudice is somewhat more difficult than agreeing that the composition of an object can change.  But imagine that teleportation became possible, and the object began to have breaks.  Gaps are needed to model such objects as the director of an enterprise.  This object breaks when there is a change of leadership. </p></div>
