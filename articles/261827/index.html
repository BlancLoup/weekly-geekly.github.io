And the consistent use of studied technologies increases interest and quality.  This story began with the fact that I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/masterkit/blog/255827/">assembled a 3D printer</a> 3D MC3 Master v1.1 and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/252416/">made movable ears with a reaction to the sound</a> . <br>  But then I wanted not only to create something interesting, but also useful.  Therefore, I began work on creating my robot vacuum cleaner and urge all the Habrasoobschestvu connect and help somewhere with advice, but somewhere with logic and experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/329/01f/5dd/32901f5dd6884765b6e4a50409da926f.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Well, since I already have a 3D printer, I will print the maximum of the possible parts myself.  A controller <a href="http://masterkit.ru/shop/arduino/controllers/1344132">Arduino Mega 2560</a> and actuators, I successfully found on the site MASTER KIT.  But we will return to the gland later, but first you need to understand the logic of movement and actions of the vacuum cleaner robot. <br><br>  Experimentally (not mine), the rules for creating robotic vacuum cleaners were established: <br>  1. The robot must be round, low cylinder. <br>  2. The wheels must be in diameter so that it can turn in place. <br>  3. The thruster does not need a motor <br>  4. The main thing is that the robot could collect garbage inside. <br>  5. Without a contact bumper can not be, it must cover at least half of the perimeter of the robot <br>  6. The center of gravity of the robot should be near the wheels, ideally coincide with them - for better grip. <br>  7. The robot must be charged from the charging station without removing the batteries. <br>  8. The waste bin should be easily removable. <br><br>  <b>Motion algorithm</b> <br>  There are two main ways to move the vacuum cleaner robots and so far none of the methods have proven their complete superiority.  The first is to move along an unwinding spiral.  The second method is zigzag movement. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31d/ca2/71f/31dca271fbe64f03bec4063183d22112.gif"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/105/203/ac3/105203ac32294b9583d8b2eed9771302.gif"><br><br>  It does not take into account the construction of a map of the premises from the photographs, and all movement occurs solely on the basis of sensor readings.  Further, what needs to be considered is overcoming and circumventing obstacles.  To do this, it is best to use bumpers and contact sensors.  Because if along the way there will be a thin leg of the chair, then the rays of several sensors can pass by.  When faced with a large bumper, the controller understands which side the obstacle is located and drives around it. <br><br>  <b>Cleaning</b> <br>  If an ordinary vacuum cleaner takes its own due to a powerful pump and a large suction power, then it is impossible to achieve the same power on a small vacuum cleaner with an autonomous power supply.  Experience suggested that the combination of a small brush and a suction turbine is most effective.  In addition, since the device is a washer, in order to pick up debris from the corners, two rotating brushes are placed in front of the machine, throwing debris to the main large brush. <br><br>  <b>Driving force</b> <br>  The best moving speed will be 25-35 cm per second.  It is not too fast to collect everything and not too slow, so that the battery charge is enough for any sufficient space.  The most commonly used spring-loaded gearboxes with engines.  This is done in order to stop the movement if the vacuum cleaner falls, hangs, or is lifted.  I believe that it will be correct to use stepper motors, since this will allow you to set the speed of the program, without using gears, selecting power.  Transmission to the wheels will be direct or belt.  The vacuum cleaner will have only 5 engines: 2 for wheels, one for the main brush, one for two rotating brushes on the sides, one for the retractor turbine. <br><br>  <b>Nutrition</b> <br>  It is planned to power the entire system from a gel battery with a voltage of 12V and a capacity of 7 Ah.  That is the standard battery from the UPS.  Its advantage is that it has enough capacity to work, it is cheap and affordable, it has enough weight to press the vacuum cleaner to the floor.  There are two main methods of charging: induction and direct contact.  Despite all the advantages of direct contact, I decided to play in favor of wireless charging: partly because it‚Äôs safer (and I have curious cats), partly because I don‚Äôt want to solve the problem of oxidized or loose contacts.  Fortunately, I found an excellent kit for a <a href="http://masterkit.ru/shop/battery/chargers/1865048">PW-WL-12</a> wireless 12 volt charger.  A current of 350 mA will charge the battery when fully discharged in 10 hours, which is a bit too much, and the battery cannot be planted like this.  Therefore, I decided to acquire two such charges and install them below and above the case, providing a double charge current of 700 mA. <br><br>  <b>Sensors</b> <br>  So that the robot could navigate in space, did not fall from the steps and did not rest against the walls, feedback is required.  It will be implemented with a large number of sensors.  For example, infrared distance sensors will not allow you to get close to the wall and scratch it.  If there is a small object on the way that does not fall in the field of view of the sensors, the contact sensors in the bumpers are triggered.  In addition, infrared sensors at the bottom edge will prevent the robot from falling if there is an empty space under the front edge.  Also, a pair of sensors will need to be put on the wheels so that when detached from the floor, the device stops working. <br>  The sensors will be used such: IR - for measuring distances, contact - for bumpers and wheels. <br><br>  <b>Return to base</b> <br>  One of the most difficult tasks that all robot makers are trying to accomplish is to return to their own base for charging.  And it is good when the room is strictly square or rectangular.  In this case, it is enough to install the base in the corner or move it to the wall and the mechanism for returning to the base becomes extremely simple: one side goes along the wall until the robot stops at the base.  But it is worth adding furniture or having several openings to other rooms and the task is immediately complicated.  I decided to use a <a href="http://masterkit.ru/shop/studygoods/1458408">beacon</a> to determine the distance to the base.  At a distance, the signal subsides, and when approaching it becomes louder.  My base search method will be based on this. <br><br>  <b>Programming and soldering</b> <br>  I initially did not want to do the soldering and self-assembly of the controller piping.  Since the Arduino platform already has a lot of standard shields for connecting sensors and actuators, I will use them and will try to make the project as simple and accessible as possible.  Only sensor contacts will be soldered if they do not have standard connection wires.  I will program in the standard version for Arduino, because it is: 1 - simple, 2 - easy to repeat.  Even I, familiar with the basics of programming, was able to cope with learning the language and program the controller to automate the heating and ventilation system.  Therefore, the calculation is on the simplicity of repetition and execution. <br><br>  <b>Stages</b> <br>  All work on the robot vacuum cleaner will be divided into several stages: <br>  1. Creating a housing, chassis, dust collection unit and the creation of a normal dust collector with a turbine <br>  2. The distribution of sensors on the contour of the case and the coordination of their work <br>  3. Programming the simplest functions of movement and cleaning <br>  4. Bypass obstacles and the logic of movement when cleaning <br>  5. Search base and the right approach to it for a full charge <br><br>  <b>Reference and Follower</b> <br>  As in any experiment, there should be an experimental group and a reference one in order to compare the results obtained.  As a reference, it was decided to take <a href="http://iclebo.com.ru/robots/%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BF%25D1%258B%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581-iclebo-arte">iClebo Arte</a> .  In the course of construction, I will rely on the finished engineering solutions of the factory robot cleaner and try to simplify / cheapen the existing model.  As a result, should pass a comparative test of two vacuum cleaners: homemade and factory. <br><br>  <b>Invitation</b> <br>  Anyone who wants to participate in such a project can feel free to write in the comments and join the development.  All tips and desires will be taken into account and, I am sure, the work on creating your own vacuum cleaner robot will be significantly accelerated. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261827/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261827/</a></p>
