    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qt/or/vs/qtorvsdrls3uoe56suf-g8svk3w.png"><br><br>  In this study, scientists from Texas and Arizona universities (USA) used data obtained by the radar subsurface sounding radar SHARAD (Mars SHAllow RADar sounder), installed on board the NASA MRO spacecraft (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lm/rw/dq/lmrwdqory9xyokj0spojgjapgqu.png"><br><br>  The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) was launched on August 12, 2005, reached Mars on March 10, 2006, and in November 2006 began full-fledged scientific research after the completion of orbital maneuvers, inspections and calibrations of onboard equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ka/wn/ic/kawnicm1zwzsuadcqncyg-wzvnk.png"><br><br>  MRO contains a number of scientific instruments, such as cameras, spectrometers, radars, which are used to analyze the relief, stratigraphy, minerals and ice on Mars. <br><br>  The MRO is equipped with a SHARAD radar designed to study the internal structure of the Martian polar caps, as well as to collect data on underground ice deposits. <br><br>  The external radar antenna is a separate unit on the MRO. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f1/ai/lv/f1ailvwcu7p5ug7u8zcp4q_once.png"><br><br>  SHARAD radar uses HF radio waves in the range of 15-25 MHz, which allows it to probe the surface to a depth of 7 m to 1 km.  Horizontal resolution ranges from 0.3 to 3 km (0.3‚Äì1 km along-track and 3‚Äì6 km across-track).  The pulse duration is 85 ¬µs, and the nominal pulse repetition rate is 700.28 Hz, the transmitted power is 10 W, and a ten-meter dipole antenna is used for measurements. <br><br>  The sensing method is a radar synthesizing aperture that allows you to take radar images of the Martian surface and objects on it, regardless of meteorological conditions and the level of natural light of the area with detail comparable to aerial photographs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sb/bw/ol/sbbwoleinsojf6zjgxbue6unlsk.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/in/7c/cn/in7ccnnrmg65iffyj2l0dantzci.png"><br><br>  To expand the capabilities of the radar, scientists use SHARAD paired with the radar MARSIS, which has a lower resolution, but is able to probe the surface to a depth of 5 km.  MARSIS is installed on another spacecraft currently operating - Mars Express. <br><br>  In their new scientific work, scientists have shown that they discovered the remains of ancient ice sheets lying beneath the surface at the north pole of the planet at a depth of more than one and a half kilometers, which serves as evidence of the existence on Mars of periods of growth and depletion of polar ice associated with changes in its orbit and tilt. <br><br>  The results are important because the layers of ice on Mars are a kind of annual rings that keep records of the climate on it in the past.  A study of the geometry and composition of these layers can tell us whether there have ever been conditions favorable for the emergence of life. <br><br>  <b>How did these underground layers form?</b> <br><br>  The process of ice accumulation at the poles of the planet took place during the last glacial periods. <br><br>  Further, when the planet began to heat up, the remains of ice caps were covered with sand, which protected the ice from the sun's rays and prevented its volatilization into the atmosphere, and then into outer space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/1x/8c/zv1x8cx3eybzvmxm8qrwxurkxt0.jpeg"><br><br>  With a period of about 50,000 years, Mars leans toward the Sun, and then gradually returns to a vertical position, like an oscillating top. <br><br>  When Mars rotates in a vertical position, its equator faces the Sun, which causes the process of growth of polar ice caps.  As Mars changes its slope, the ice at the poles is covered with layers of sand, so that there are alternating layers of ice and sand not very deep beneath the surface of the planet near the poles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cj/wo/tv/cjwotvatiq_pzsqtkxfletemes0.jpeg"><br><br>  These findings are important because the layers of ice reflect ancient climate changes on Mars, much like the growth rings of trees reflect changes in the ancient climate on Earth. <br><br>  Abbreviations used in the pictures below: <br><br><ul><li>  north polar layered deposits (NPLD); </li><li>  Basal unit (BU); </li><li>  dielectric constant Œµ '(Œµ' = 8.8 for sand, Œµ '= 3.1 for ice); </li><li>  Rocks (Rupes); </li><li>  The North Plateau (Planum Boreum) is a plain located at the north pole of Mars. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/at/p6/5o/atp65orujszc8bga2wbl5oatcbq.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Data and graphs from the research work:</b> <br><br>  <u>Figure 1.
