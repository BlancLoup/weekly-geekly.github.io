  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Time management for slobs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>"Spend time?!</i>  <i>Look what you want!</i>  <i>You will not pass the time! ‚Äù/L.Keroll.</i>  <i>"Alice in Wonderland".</i>  <i>Per.</i>  <i>B. Zakhoder /</i> <br><br>  Recently I attended a lecture by Gleb Arkhangelsky on time management and decided to share my thoughts on this topic.  I do not question the classical theory of time management and its achievements.  However, it seemed to me that it might not suit many people.  In particular, I definitely would not want to live on it - my life would become predictable, like a railway in Germany, and therefore dull and uninteresting.  It seems to me that the muse to the person who uses time-management will not come (or will come, sit for a while and leave), since  at any given time, such a person will pore over a pre-planned to-do list. <br><br>  A muse is a muse, and things should be done even by those who do not like schedules.  For such people my time management principles, which I derived for myself empirically, may be interesting.  In part, following these rules contributed to the fact that I have developed, and it seems to be, unsuccessfully, my own business over the last 2 years.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, these rules are simple: you need to make an SLA according to the time of task execution, depending on the time required to complete them.  In my case, the SLA looks like this: <br><br>  <i><b>1. Everything that can be done in 3 minutes should be done immediately.</b></i> <br><br>  For example, instead of scheduling a call to Ivanov, you take and call this Ivanov right now.  In this way, you not only speed up all work processes, but also avoid unnecessary overhead planning in time for planning small matters. <br><br>  <i><b>2. Everything that can be done in 30 minutes must be done today.</b></i> <br><br>  For example, if you need to write a letter to Petrov, you open a new message window in your email client, enter Petrov‚Äôs email address and continue to do current work.  At the end of the day, closing unnecessary windows before turning off the computer, you will find this letter and you will definitely have to write it before leaving home from work. <br><br>  <i><b>3. Everything that can be done in more than 30 minutes should be done this week.</b></i> <br><br>  It is my deep conviction that if an individual task cannot be solved in a week, then this is an incorrect task, since  it was not properly broken up and delegated.  Therefore, if the clock is 9 pm Friday, and you have not started any of the tasks of this week, then it is your fault that part of the task was not transferred to Sidorov in time, so you will have to go to the embrasure and solve this problem without help. . <br><br>  These 3 simple rules allow you to minimize the planning process and speed up your interaction with the outside world, which means all projects and processes that you lead (just like when loading a site, reducing ping by 50 ms accelerates the download of the entire site to seconds).  The disadvantage of these rules is one - they periodically lead to abrasions.  But, as you know, the Russian man has only 2 states - abraham and stagnation, therefore avraly sometimes need to be artificially created in order to achieve tangible results.  And in order not to breathe out of an excessive number of job-seeking habits and not get a negative effect on them in your personal life, you can, for example, forbid yourself to work on weekends and / or take the habit of communicating with family members in the morning, rather than in the evening. <br><br>  In addition to the above rules for scheduling time using the principles of SLA, I have 3 more principles for organizing affairs that I borrowed from Winnie the Pooh <br><br>  <i><b>but.</b></i>  <i><b>Come to visit in the morning</b></i> <br><br>  Make important appointments in the morning to insure against a possible shift in your schedule. <br><br>  <i><b>b.</b></i>  <i><b>Walk in circles, not back and forth</b></i> <br><br>  Try to combine several cases at once.  If you are going to a meeting in a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, then remember if you have other business in this or neighboring areas.  If you are discussing something with someone, remember if you can still discuss something with this person. <br><br>  <i><b>at.</b></i>  <i><b>Do not forget to eat on time</b></i> <br><br>  Without food (physical and spiritual), the brain quickly stops working.  It is especially good when you manage to bolster up in a company of colleagues or partners, discussing the prospects for the development of the technologies you are working on or just the latest industry news ‚Äî you don‚Äôt have to search for this news on the Internet yourself, spending precious time on it.  And most importantly, during such exchanges, usually all the best ideas come, which then can only be realized. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention to those who read to the end, I will be glad to questions, comments and especially advice! <br><br>  Update: an unnecessary overhead is also created by switching between tasks.  Try to avoid this, and then following paragraph 1 will not lead to the transition from important matters to routine. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285462/</a></p>
