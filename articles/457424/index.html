    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bp/io/dv/bpiodva1xjg6vdsybzzhdhpqiem.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today, numerous advertising materials call for more likely to play Laser Tag on special platforms, quests are organized right in the courtyards of the sleeping areas, a whole bunch of offers of different duration and price category. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n9/vb/hp/n9vbhpidn54sz8db_nhgkrbbyyk.gif"><br><br>  With such an abundance of offers, it is not obvious, is it necessary to buy your personal Laser Tag for individual use, to what extent is it appropriate?  Another thing is to get together with friends, recruit a team, come to an agreement with everyone, come, shoot, leave - this is also a whole quest before the quest. <br><br>  So personal laser war is quite a good idea.  And such sets are in the <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/katalog/armogear.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darmogear%26utm_campaign%3Darmogear">ArmoGear</a> assortment.  And they seemed to us cool. <br><br>  There is an option for <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/armog2-rb.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darmogear%26utm_campaign%3Darmogear2">two</a> or <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/armog4.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darmogear%26utm_campaign%3Darmogear4">four</a> players to choose from.  They differ only quantitatively, so tell about the sets on the example of a double set. <br><br>  The set consists of two elements: a tag (tag) and a pistol. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l3/jp/25/l3jp25untml4_gpgo3dn-qmbl3s.jpeg"><br><br>  Such a label is put on the player‚Äôs chest and is programmed by the ‚ÄúTeam‚Äù button on the color of the team for which he will play.  She also has an on-off button and a speaker, which notifies with a sound signal that a player has been hit.  Vibration is also notable for this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fo/fr/c_/fofrc_yb32pvcpz2rlt8p5oeht0.jpeg"><br><br>  On the chest, it all looks very "tonistarkovski-like", but does not interfere with movement.  The only thing you need to pay attention to - belts are not regulated.  And if they somehow stretch out on an adult person, they will have to be taken in to a child. <br><br>  The indication around the central diode is divided into three parts.  For each shot, a percentage of life will be taken away, and after all three bars run out, the player will hear Game Over. <br><br>  The second main element is an infrared gun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/0v/wp/gn0vwpwiv9hw7jakymrqyxetl38.jpeg"><br><br>  It is made quite simply from plastic.  It has several control buttons - on / off, command selection, ‚Äúchange‚Äù of weapons.  This means that you can change the audio: a single shot, turn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cp/es/d7/cpesd7ttoa4_yhhesnyk2orash8.jpeg"><br><br>  Lower arm - recharge.  Cartridges here realistically end sooner or later.  And he, with a slightly longer hold, activates the stealth mode: the lights on the blaster go out. <br><br>  The process itself is quite simple: you need to turn on both devices, adjust them so that the colors on the chest and on the gun match.  The second player chooses other colors, and then both begin to dodge and aim. <br><br>  As soon as the first Game Over sounds, the game can be restarted again by turning the devices off and on again.  The process can be described as fairly quick, fun, painless, unlike the closest street paintball alternative.  And not brand. <br><br>  Laser tag initially, when it first appeared in the 70s, could be described as a military simulator inspired by Star Wars, then it was positioned as a new sport.  In general, there was not so much about ‚Äútoy‚Äù here, and the players should have some skills: dexterity, dexterity, accuracy. <br><br>  They tried to take this into account in the current version.  For example, the "spread" of bullets here is small.  With a distance of a little less than half a meter, you will no longer fall into the enemy, and when you consider that all this happens at a working distance of up to 45 meters, the situation is really complicated. <br><br>  The only thing that seems to be some simplification is the number of tags ‚Äî it‚Äôs all alone here.  Of course, to take out the enemy, one shot is not enough, but still.  You need to shoot at the same point.  This somewhat complicates the process, because no particularly super-tricky strategy to sneak up from the side or from behind does not work out: you run into an adversary face to face. <br><br>  Here, for example, option equipment: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yi/hj/ix/yihjix8j_kzg2zxip1pf-t5htvo.png"><br><br>  Here you can shoot in the shoulder, wound the enemy, make it from an unexpected place.  We have only ‚Äútoni-stark-style‚Äù in the sets: there is a risk that sooner or later the whole game will be reduced to the usual cowboy shootout. <br><br>  Anyway, we liked the first experiments.  Houses from around the corner or in the courtyard can be passed for a while.  The only difference is that the diodes are not so bright, and on the street to understand how much the enemy has already been injured is complicated, especially from a distance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o5/yw/qk/o5ywqka66-t4ldya8phbvgfawp8.jpeg"><br><br>  What is missing here is the batteries - they are not included.  Each device works from 3 AAA, so you need to stock up on twelve small-pinky batteries to start the game.  <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/katalog/armogear.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darmogear%26utm_campaign%3Darmogear">You can buy sets by</a> the end of the week with a 15% discount on the <b>HABRTAG</b> coupon. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457424/</a></p>
