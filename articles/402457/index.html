  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As a failure of the Amazon voice assistant to confess to work at the CIA, once again amused America</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Amazon‚Äôs voice assistant Alexa became the subject of jokes and suspicions this month when one of the owners of Amazon Echo Dot 2 addressed her with the question: ‚ÄúAlex, do you work for the CIA?‚Äù - what the voice assistant literally didn‚Äôt know what to answer, and just turned off.  With that, Alex could answer the question of what the CIA is.  The funniest reaction to this story came out last Monday at the Ellen Show: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YDMVBwwl1ug" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>There are Russian subtitles in the video</i> <br><br>  In the parody clip "Alex" persuades his owner "not to open this topic," and then calls for reinforcement and runs away from home, firing back. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Amazon representatives declared it a technical failure, which was immediately <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/03/is-amazon-alexa-connected-to-cia.html">corrected</a> and to the question whether Alex works for the CIA, she answers now: ‚ÄúNo, I work for Amazon.‚Äù  In general, the spoons were found.  But the sediment remained.

      It just so happens that right now spy is one of the top themes in American media: it all started with another WikiLeaks plum, reporting that the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/worried-cia-hacked-samsung-tv-heres-tell/">CIA learned</a> how <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/worried-cia-hacked-samsung-tv-heres-tell/">to crack Samsung TVs</a> (again bad PR for poor Koreans) to record audio and even video what is happening in the room with the alleged TV off. <br><br>  More - more: President Trump announced that, according to his information, Barack Obama had ordered a wiretap in the Trump Tower during the 2016 election campaign.  This information was not confirmed by anything, but Trump's adviser Kellyann Conway, defending his boss, made it clear on national TV that even the microwave ovens could spy on their owners, which immediately gave rise to a powerful wave of frauds in response: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94dBs0qUiqU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And finally, the incident with "Alexa" - again a home gadget, again the CIA.  This story has been the subject of many jokes;  the whole parade of wit turned, of course, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5yeefj/alexa_are_you_connected_to_the_cia/%3Fsort%3Dtop">on Reddith</a> .  The most awesome comment is the answer in the style of you-know-what movie: "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't answer that question." <br><br>  And our favorite joke in the top - that Alexa just resorted to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BA_%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590">Fifth Amendment</a> , allowing not to testify against themselves. <br><br>  Who knows what other consequences this could cause, whether accidental or not, the failure of the Amazon voice assistant.  It is possible that for the first time in 15 years, someone even downloaded and watched the film ‚Äú <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/31462/">CIA: Operation Alex</a> ‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/501/ede/64d/501ede64db107dffad36921a588f6260.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  If you're still not afraid of surveillance </h2><br>  For us, at <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">Pochtoy.com</a> , shipping from Amazon is one of the main areas of work.
