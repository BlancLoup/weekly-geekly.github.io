  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 vs Logitech Wave</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In his predilections - man is irrational.  Take for example - stationery.  And what can explain the passion for pens, notebooks, organizers, various sticky leaves?  Certainly not by common sense, but by something else, originally embedded in human nature. <br>  As for the IT-industry, here this property of human nature is even more pronounced.  Absolutely similar in content, phenomena give rise to countless disputes and even ‚Äúideological wars.‚Äù <br>  And, probably, almost everyone has an inexplicable passion for something.  Whether it is Unix-like operating systems, text editors, time management programs, or computer peripherals. <br>  Somehow it happened that it was for me that the keyboard became such a phenomenon.  Maybe because since the first computer appeared, I really liked ‚Äútyping‚Äù (because I really didn‚Äôt like to write)? <br>  At first there was a clone of the ZX-Spectrum, a work of Novgorod engineers, whose keyboard inspired respect.  Then the Russian PC "Search" - he had very tight keys with a reed mechanism.  Then a variation of IBM XT made in India appeared, with a keyboard, with very soft keys, which seemed like a miracle after the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù.  In the era of the 386s were Chicony, Mitsumi.  The magazines advertised supposedly completely unique ‚Äúnot for all‚Äù keyboards - Cherry, which I never had a chance to try. <br>  Then began the era of Genius.  Cheap, with a bunch of extra buttons for every taste, at an affordable price.  There‚Äôs probably nothing bad to say about them.  In addition to one - it is consumer goods.  And consumer goods is not interesting, because it does not cause emotions.  Therefore, using Genius, black with a wrist rest, I was constantly looking at the windows in search of something that might really interest me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And here, I met her - Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 v1.0. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/00a/d10/8ac/00ad108ac804b7cf987bba87af67e2b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A detailed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/67304/">review of it was already on Habr√©</a> , so I confine myself to subjective observations. <br><br>  Externally, the keyboard was just amazing.  The alphabetic part divided into two halves, a huge gap, a soft material under the wrists with something, a rather interesting response to pressing.  Her appearance spoke of quality, reliability, and even some "fundamental". <br>  Since I do not consider it right to make such purchases, even if they are not very expensive ‚Äúfrom a raid,‚Äù I sat down to study the Internet.  It turned out that such a keyboard is used by writers such as Yevgeny Kozlovsky and <a href="http://exler.ru/blog/item/921/">Alex Exler</a> , who print quite a few.  On the whole, the responses on the network were quite positive.  Therefore, the decision to purchase was finally made. <br>  Getting used to the keyboard required a lot.  Homeworkers, who sometimes had to sit at my computer, could not use the keyboard without a mat.  Their epithets were ‚Äúhuge‚Äù, ‚Äúterrible‚Äù, ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù.  But what do they understand in such a delicate matter?  After a few days, I managed to print quite successfully and quickly.  But there were also disadvantages, which were pretty annoying.  And the main one was the distance between the keys because of their considerable size.  Let me explain by example.  We print the word "hello".  Fingers stand on "fyvaya" - "Aldzh."  Shifting the index finger of the left hand type "p".  The index finger of the right - "p".  The index finger of the left hand is shifted to "and".  And after that, with the middle finger of my left hand, I have to press "c".  I want to do this by lifting my index finger from the "and."  So for such a maneuver it is necessary to do a rather tight stretching with your fingers and sometimes there is a stumbling.  And this happens quite often, the word "hello - just for example. <br>  The way out of this situation is to keep your fingers just above the keys, moving the brush while typing.  Another point - which is not very pleased, is the noisy pressing of the space bar.  In general, the keyboard can be characterized not very noisy, but the space spoiled the whole picture.  Also to the disadvantages can be attributed, and poorly working and sticking in my case, the scale control between the letter blocks.  Although I didn‚Äôt use it much, it‚Äôs still unpleasant. <br>  With all its drawbacks, I still didn‚Äôt want to go back to work on an ordinary keyboard.  A soft wrist rest is quite comfortable.  And the keyboard was pleasing to the eye, so the aesthetic side of the coin is also quite important. <br>  Whatever it was, but working on the keyboard from Melkomyagkih, I sometimes glanced in the direction of other products.  And, by and large, Logitech Wave turned out to be the only worthy and interesting competitor on the market in my eyes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3f/06c/0e3/f3f06c0e3ff6d9709c28ca7fe9720e8b.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://www.premagination.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/wave.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Undivided into two halves, however, due to the special ‚Äúwave‚Äù shape, it was positioned by the manufacturer as a new word in print ergonomics.  Allegedly, this form takes into account the anatomical structure of the brush, making the seal more comfortable.  The TV ad on YouTube also made me treat the keyboard as a rather serious, finished product, which I didn‚Äôt spend on developing <br>  little time and money. <br>  Therefore, thinking about what to give myself for the New Year, I decided to ask Santa Claus exactly this keyboard and, wow!  Received. <br>  I will not describe the packaging in detail and the driver, I don‚Äôt <a href="http://www.thg.ru/consumer/logitech_wave/index.html">have enough of</a> this stuff on the net, I‚Äôll stop on sensations. <br>  So - the keyboard is very soft.  Even, it can be said that it is too soft.  Plus this or a minus is hard to say.  But when working on it, you still unconsciously somehow expect a certain elasticity, which is not.  Most likely, noise is a consequence of softness.  The sound is not very pleasant, plastic.  For those who print at night - a disadvantage. <br>  The fingers lie on the keys quite comfortably, and I have not noticed such straining moments as when writing the word ‚Äúhello‚Äù at the 4000th.  Although the distance between "and" and "in" also turns out not small.  Perhaps the fact is that the size of the keys is small - standard.  Does the wave form have any advantages in printing?  Hard to say.  Definitely - does not interfere.  And I think it will be possible to feel the difference with a conventional keyboard only after two or three months of work. <br>  Number of typos?  One gets the feeling that there are fewer of them with Logitek.  It is worth emphasizing very convenient and comfortable pressing the "space" key.  In this case, the wave design is what you need.  This is expressed in the fact that when the fingers stand on ‚Äúfyvaya‚Äù - ‚Äúoldzh‚Äù, then the big fingers lying on the gap appear as if in the recesses and therefore pressing turns out quite comfortable and natural.  And, most importantly, without strumming like a 4000th sound.  Wrist rest is not worse than Microsoft.  Also under the skin, only steeper, since perforated ;-) <br>  The size of the "wave" keyboard is a couple of centimeters smaller.  However, if the 4000th was looked at on the table by some kind of ‚Äúgiant‚Äù, then this one is quite a ‚Äúregular‚Äù keyboard.  Amused available plastic transparent dust cap.  Just like from the past. <br>  If we talk about the layout, then Logitek, in contrast to Microsoft, has a large Enter, but the trimmed block of keys above the cursor is deprived of the ‚ÄúIns‚Äù key. <br>  As a conclusion: To personally I advised to choose?  To answer this question is quite difficult.  And that, and another keyboard - not bad, but at the same time, it is impossible to call them ideal.  One gets the feeling that the products are somewhat "flawed" and have as their goal to speculate on the feelings of people who have a weakness in the pursuit of everything "ergonomic" in general or in particular for keyboards.  Imperfection is not expressed in ‚Äúergonomic‚Äù moments, but in the mechanism of keystrokes.  But the "response" is no less important than the correct form!  One of them ‚Äústicks‚Äù, the other one here. <br>  However, the price of the considered keyboards is not twenty thousand, not seven, but about 1,500-2,000 rubles for the wired version, so they are quite worth the money. <br>  Microsoft's keyboard takes longer to get used to.  And, quite possibly, for you it will be the most convenient.  Or maybe not.  The same Exler <a href="http://exler.livejournal.com/514180.html">returned to using his old keyboard</a> .  As for the Logitech Wave, it is completely ordinary, in the positive sense of the word.  Get used to it is not necessary at all.  The wave form does not interfere, and, perhaps, is a plus that you begin to understand after a long time of work. <br>  As for the multimedia functions of both keyboards, they are quite identical.  The volume and calculator buttons are both there and there ;-) <br>  Keyboard from Microsoft - absolutely not possible to understand in the store.  Be sure to "drive", so as not to spend money on the wind.  And Logitech Wave - if you like it, take it - you will not regret it. </div>
