  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"KM online" requires an apology from the newspaper "Vedomosti"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Vedomosti published incorrect statistics on visiting odnoklassniki.km.ru (seven people per day), and for this the site owners, KM Online, are <a href="http://www.km.ru/magazin/view.asp%3Fid%3D4F76B9D9762D4CABA46101CB34761B8D">going to demand</a> compensation for material damage in the amount of <b>$ 300,000</b> (or just apologize on the pages of the newspaper; that - see below).  This is supposedly their real damage today, and in the future it may increase even more. <br><br>  The company "KM online" - the main lover of court squabbles in RuNet.  It has not yet been erased from the memory of how this firm, with the help of legal pressure, tried to close the online libraries of Runet, including the most famous Moshkov Library.  Perhaps it is the legal department that brings the lion‚Äôs share of the firm‚Äôs income, given that the company gets into the news only thanks to loud lawsuits. <br>  Now the lawyers of ‚ÄúKM Online‚Äù successfully provoked another judicial scandal.  It all started with the fact that they renamed their service classmates.km.ru (a social network for meeting classmates) into <a href="http://odnoklassniki.km.ru/">odnoklassniki.km.ru</a> .  Of course, this immediately caused dissatisfaction with the owners of the social network <a href="http://www.odnoklassniki.ru/">Odnoklassniki</a> .  Albert Popkov immediately sued, and also sent an angry press release to the newspapers, and the Vedomosti newspaper on Wednesday, July 16, published a note <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml%3F2008/07/16/155107">entitled ‚ÄúOdnoklassniki Dispute‚Äù</a> , completely taking the side of Popkov. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This position of ‚ÄúVedomosti‚Äù journalists can be understood, because to any reasonable person, the reasons why ‚ÄúKM online‚Äù renamed its service are clear.  And the reputation of the company has long been known.  However, lawyers, as always, are not guided by common sense, but by the letter of the law.  So, the KM online service was launched back in 2003, and its original name is the English version of the word classmates.  So the court can once again stand up for clever businessmen from KM Online. <br><br>  However, KM Online wants more.  They also threaten to sue Vedomosti newspaper.  The reason was the incorrect statistics of attendance, which was quoted by journalists.  They wrote: <i>‚ÄúAccording to Liveinternet statistics, on Tuesday, <b>seven visitors</b> went to odnoklassniki.km.ru, and 4 million to odnoklassniki.ru</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  Of course, here the journalists demonstrated their complete technical illiteracy, which KM Online will use with pleasure, demanding compensation for material damage in the amount of as much as $ 300 thousand.

      On July 18, the director of KM Online sent a complaint letter to the chief editor of the Vedomosti newspaper, Elizaveta Ossetinskaya, which demands are made to apologize until July 23 of this year and publish a refutation of the information.  The letter specifically states: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWe did not disclose statistics for the reason that there was no need for us in this.</i>  <i>However, there is no big secret in this, and we are ready to voice these figures: at the time of writing this letter, 2490427 users are registered on the odnoklassniki.km.ru project, and 12-15 thousand new users are registered every day.</i>  <i>From 150 to 300 thousand people use the service daily. ‚Äù</i>  On the morning of July 21, 2522126 users have already registered on the odnoklassniki.km.ru website. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29735/</a></p>
