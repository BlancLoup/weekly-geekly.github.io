If earlier in the winter and spring sales of rollers and skateboards sharply increased, then modern society prefers ‚Äúpersonal electric transport‚Äù.  Words such as segway, gyroscooter and electric skid are part of the everyday use of the Russian language.  Let's try to deal with all this zoo in more detail: What?  Where?  How much? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Personal electric transport.  Start </h2><br>  Back in 2001, Dean Kamen introduced the two-wheeled vehicle, naming it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway_PT">Segway</a> .  The simplicity of management, minimalistic, but at the same time beautiful design was planted on fertile American soil and - in the literal sense of the word - launched a start-up into an international orbit.  Even Steve Jobs himself honored the development of a short but capacious phrase: " <i>as the</i> development of personal electric chariots" on the same shelf as the invention and creation of the PC. <br><br>  In the United States, due to the lack of a developed public transport system and, to a certain extent, giant-style construction, such portable electric scooters have gained immense popularity.  Yes, and the use of Segway on production sites or when shooting movies and during sporting events, when it is necessary to travel significant distances to and fro during the day, laid the foundation for a successful start.

      For example, GT fans will surely recall the Mythbusters and Adam Savage series, which cuts through an abandoned airfield on the Segway - this was a time of white envy: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c59/5b7/d11/c595b7d117fb43a19ebe9919c76bc476.jpg" width="600"></div><br><br>  Over time, the engineers created more miniature, but capacious batteries and compact, but powerful electric motors, and microelectronics stepped so far forward that the mini-computer responsible for balancing segways, gyroscopes and electro-skates fit in the palm of your hand. <br><br>  Gradually, personal electric vehicles moved from "elite golf clubs" to the streets of cities and became available to almost everyone ... <br><br><h2>  Personal electric transport to the masses </h2><br>  <b>1. Modern Segway from Xiaomi for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/wj">$ 482 *</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e5/2cf/844/0e52cf8441df4cbabb77a1b5040a5512.jpg" width="600"></div><br><br>  The old, kind and time-tested segway from the company Xiaomi.  Distinctive features of this model are powerful engines of 350 W each, which allows it to reach an average speed of 16 km / h.  Of course, Usain Bolt will not be able to catch up, but you can compete with a marathon runner.  At the same time, the capacity of the installed battery is enough for a trip of as much as 22 km.  And wheels with a diameter of 10.5 inches provide excellent maneuverability in urban environments and parks.  Unfortunately, the rider's weight limit is 85 kg. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/969/605/2d1/9696052d163e4c5a972908df3fa5a77d.jpg" width="400"></div><br><br>  Naturally, the company follow the fashion.  This segway can be connected via BlueTooth (BT) to a smartphone using the <a href="http://www.ninebot.com/plus/list.php%3Ftid%3D24">Ninebot</a> app, which is available on both iOS and Android, and remotely controlled! <br><br>  The LED lighting system allows not only to illuminate the way ahead of the device, but also gives signals to other road users: turning, stopping - all in an adult way. <br><br>  <b>2. Segway off-road for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/wk">$ 1,512 *</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30f/792/9fe/30f7929fe57f49ad9a393fe521acef5e.jpg" width="400"></div><br><br>  Yes, Xiaomi segway cope well with urban conditions, parks and small puddles, but what if you need a Segway not for the city, but for the countryside? <br><br>  In this case, it is worth looking at the model with high maneuverability.  19 inch wheels will cope even with Russian roads after good spring and summer rain.  The maximum speed of such a Segway is 20 km / h, and the power reserve is all 30 km, which is ensured by powerful motors (1.6 kW!) And a capacious battery. <br><br>  Naturally, the device is made with appropriate protection from moisture and dust and is able to climb the mountain at an angle of up to 35 degrees! <br><br>  Order a monster can be in several colors: black, green, blue, yellow, red and even white. <br><br>  <b>3. Hoverboard from $ 300-450, depending on the model chosen and wheel size <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/wl">10 inches *</a> , <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/wn">8 inches *</a> , <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/wo">6.5 inches *</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/897/bac/cdb/897baccdb14b4e03b7876136e99b30bd.PNG" width="600"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/740/e61/b9b/740e61b9b05048f58a6812c807abc3e0.PNG" width="600"></div><br><br>  Perhaps today, the hoverboard, step by step, is gaining popularity with the Segway.  The main reason is lightness and compactness.  If segway weighs sometimes up to 30-40-50 kg, then the weight of the hover usually does not exceed 10-12 kg.  At the same time, you can always pack it in a case for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/wp">10 bucks *</a> and carry it with you wherever you go. <br><br>  Of course, for compactness you have to sacrifice something.  So, the hoverboard is much more modest than the Segways at an average speed (up to 10 km / h), but the power reserve is about the same - about 20 km. <br><br>  The size of the wheels plays an important role in choosing a hoverboard.  Small wheels 6.5 and 8 inches are ideal for urban conditions and skating mainly on exactly asphalt surface.  Although 10 inch wheels seem more adapted to the conditions of Russian reality. <br><br>  Some craftsmen convert gyroscooters into "self-propelled chairs" - almost an office on wheels: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptGkGP1XxD4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjwXk4g2-bKIXmbslHA6pWuB5bVjw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>4. One-wheeled hoverboard for lovers of balance for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/wq">$ 403 *</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa0/15e/2b7/fa015e2b7f3d40fc88662ed610f67af7.PNG" width="600"></div><br><br>  And for fans of skateboards there is a special one-wheeled hoverboard or just an electric skateboard.  The principle of operation is the same as that of a hoverboard, with the only difference being one wheel on which it is necessary to balance.  Perhaps, this futuristic electric skate will also appeal to snowboard lovers and surfers. <br><br>  With a maximum speed of 25 km / h, the unit is capable of driving 30 km on a single battery charge ‚Äî quite for urban conditions.  A full charge takes 1-2 hours, so that the electric skeleton can always be recharged in a cafe during a short snack.  On the electric grid installed 10 inch wheel, which allows to overcome steep climbs up to 25-30 degrees. <br><br>  <b>A small bonus from the seller:</b> contacting him, you can order a skate with your own logo or brand name. <br><br>  <b>5. <s>Man and the steamboat</s> MonoCleso and column for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/wr">$ 318 *</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/165/042/21c/16504221cafd451cbb4cb45c9f7f878e.PNG" width="400"></div><br><br>  What Chinese engineers will not think of to satisfy the most exacting taste of consumers.  For example, they created a hybrid column and electric wheels.  An excellent solution for those who are often in nature and picnics in the parks, and at the same time wants to impress others.  You go on a picnic on the wheel, and all of a sudden you have with you a powerful audio system.  The main thing is not to get carried away, otherwise the entire battery will be spent only on listening to music and you will have to carry this engineering marvel to the nearest outlet, the benefit from above is a special carrying handle. <br><br>  Power reserve at the device - up to 30 km, at a speed of 16 km / h.  A variety of available colors and prints is impressive and does not serve calculus. <br><br>  The unit is available in three versions: basic equipment (no BT module, no headlights), advanced equipment (no BT, but headlights) and full equipment (BT and headlights are present). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55a/c8a/838/55ac8a8389d945d097c545111d16d9c5.jpg" width="400"></div><br><br>  And especially for those who are afraid of the <s>one-armed bandit of one-</s> wheel solutions or who are not sure of their vestibular apparatus, a special accessory for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/ws">$ 40</a> is already available, which increases the stability of the wheel. <br><br><h2>  What awaits us in the future? </h2><br>  And finally, I want to look into the future.  The world is definitely crazy about electro ... (substitute any familiar word). <br>  Recently <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/ev4-electric-off-road-rollerblades/42493/">on the pages of the portal GizMag</a> there was news about new electric commercials.  A distinctive feature of the add to the usual commercially available <a href="https://personalelectrictransport.co.uk/product-category/rocketskate/">wheeled electric rollers</a> is the presence of tracks, that is, on these rollers it will be possible to dissect virtually any soil (and even in the forest). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68c/37b/bd8/68c37bbd8aaf4338b3c6279cd3b929c3.jpg" width="600"></div><br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
