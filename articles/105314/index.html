The BlackBerry Tablet OS (developed using QNX Software Systems technology) was designed to provide unparalleled performance. tablet.  In honor of this event with us today, Dan Dodge (Dan Dodge), co-founder and CEO of QNX Software Systems, with whom we will talk about the BlackBerry Tablet OS itself and the prospects it opens up for application developers, web developers and publishers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/71d866e8/838a37ff/5f38f22a/e09a792a.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Tell us a little about the QNX¬Æ Neutrino operating system?</b> <br><br>  If I were asked to describe QNX Neutrino in one word, then this word would be the word "architecture".  If you look at the qualities that made QNX Neutrino so successful (reliability, scalability, performance, portability), then all of them are the results of the microkernel architecture.  They are all hidden in the heart of the system. <br><br>  This architecture explains why QNX Neutrino has such a wide range of applications, from Internet routers to automotive systems.  Today, you may be using QNX Neutrino without knowing it yourself.  It has become a part of everyday life and is used to control power plants, TV broadcasting and even when checking products for safety in use.  And today we use the flexibility and proven reliability of this architecture in the new BlackBerry Tablet OS. <br><br>  <b>What are the key features of the BlackBerry Tablet OS you can name, which would be of interest to application developers?</b> <br><br>  First of all, you can develop really cool applications for the BlackBerry PlayBook using Adobe Mobile AIR, Adobe Flash and HTML5.  Under the hood, we have a dual-core 1 GHz processor, accelerated 3D graphics, HD video and a 7-inch widescreen display with multitouch.  Just think about the potential of applications that can combine all these technologies! <br><br>  Further, since the BlackBerry Tablet OS communicates transparently with BlackBerry smartphones, all the enterprise-based features that our consumers expect to see are also available for the BlackBerry Tablet OS. <br><br>  Flexibility is sewn into the very DNA of the BlackBerry Tablet OS.  We designed it in such a way as to easily support additional frameworks and virtual machines.  For example, it was quite expected to see a virtual machine that supports Java applications for BlackBerry 6. <br><br>  As for tools, you can use standard tools from Adobe, such as Flash Builder, to develop applications, and you can debug them directly on your tablet.  For applications that require access to the native environment of the operating system, developers can create and port applications to C / C ++ and take full advantage of the QNX¬Æ Momentics¬Æ Tool Suite, which is based on standard Eclipse.  BlackBerry Tablet OS has built-in support for the integration of a graphical environment with native code. <br><br>  <b>We know that the BlackBerry Tablet OS is based on the QNX Neutrino microkernel.</b>  <b>What are the key features of QNX Neutrino at the same time opens?</b> <br><br>  First and foremost, with the QNX Neutrino micronuclear architecture, every application, driver, network stack, and virtual machine runs in a protected address space in the user space.  As a result, the BlackBerry Tablet OS has a fault-tolerant, self-recovering environment that protects programs from damage to each other or the OS itself.  This is exactly what each of us wants, using applications from a wide community of developers. <br><br>  The QNX Neutrino architecture also provides real multitasking on multi-core hardware, and its ‚Äúmulti-core perfection‚Äù has been proven to be used in the most heavily loaded routers in the world.  As a result, it can run multiple applications at the same time, while ensuring high performance.  For other tablet platforms, multitasking is a new feature, but we have it from birth. <br><br>  <b>What aspect of this project do you find most exciting?</b> <br><br>  Well, everything is simple: the creation of something, which as a result gives more than the sum of its parts.  Over the years, QNX and Research In Motion have developed phenomenal products in their fields.  This project allowed to combine all the best that they have in a single platform, and it seems to me, very, very successfully.  Our technologies turned out to be so complementary to each other, and the cultures of our companies are so compatible that we managed to create the best tablet OS for today. <br><br>  <b>Dan, we heard about how the QNX Neutrino works in many areas.</b>  <b>And what is your favorite story about its use?</b> <br><br>  To be honest, I can not choose one.  QNX Neutrino operates medical equipment that saves lives, automotive systems that locate the nearest coffee house, surveillance systems that helped create the International Space Station.  Some of these systems are really important, and some are just cool, but they are all extremely enjoyable. <br><br>  <b>Thank you for taking the time to speak with us, Dan.</b>  <b>I look forward to waiting for applications developed under the BlackBerry Tablet OS.</b>  <b>Those of you who are interested in additional information about the BlackBerry Tablet OS can study the materials and register for the upcoming BlackBerry DevZone webinar.</b>  <b>Stay tuned for news on the BlackBerry Developer's Blog!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/105314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/105314/</a></p>
