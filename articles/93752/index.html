For the same reason, on Friday night, my friends and I have to drink beer at the office, looking in and once again making sure that there are no places in all the nearest cafes.  So the idea was born to write a service <a href="http://zabroniruy.com/">zabroniruy.com</a> <br><br>  What opportunities I, as a user, would like to see in this kind of system? <ul><li>  first of all - the ability to book quickly, without wasting time searching for information on the Internet, calls, etc. </li><li>  see what \ whom I book (for example, where the cafe is located in a cafe, or which hairdresser I sign up with) </li><li>  in some form be able to observe the full picture of the work of the institution - workload and so on </li><li>  convenient search on the map, plus, for example, I would like to be able to book not only on the website of a certain institution, but also to have a map with some kind of interactive directory of institutions </li><li>  possibility of sms reminder service, for example, when you make an appointment with a doctor for a week or more </li></ul><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  This is how Zabroniruy.com appeared - a service for round-the-clock booking. </h4><br>  Of course, the mentality remains the biggest obstacle to the implementation of such a plan in the Russian market.  Most private entrepreneurs prefer not to bother with the Internet site, and the visiting log is kept at best in the Excel file. <br><br>  Therefore, the interface of the administrative part of the project was implemented as simple as possible.  For registration is enough company name, email and password.  The company also provides not only the booking service, but also a personal website with the ability to edit its content.  (Companies that already have a website can integrate our service through iframe) <br>  For greater independence from the quality of the Internet service provider, sms-notifications to employees are used.  Plus, additional features were added both to attract new customers for the institution, and to improve its internal work: <br><ul><li>  employee employment schedules, visiting schedules </li><li>  authorization of clients on the site using google, flickr, facebook and other OpenID providers </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b3/dd8/72d/6b3dd872deea0e3173ede84d16a35db0.png"><br><br><h4>  How it works (from the administrator‚Äôs point of view) </h4><br><br>  After registering, the administrator only needs to create his own database of events and employees with all sorts of descriptions and pictures, set up the company‚Äôs work schedule (holidays, breaks) and the system is ready to work. <br>  The service can be backed up both by the company's clients and the administrator himself.  Moreover, both those and others can see the calendar for the selected day and assess the degree of service utilization, choose the service and the performer (for example, back massage, Ivanova doctor). <br>  When reserved events have already appeared in the system, they are available for viewing both in the form of tables-reports with various filters, and in the form of a calendar of events (like a google calendar). <br><br>  For companies with more specific interface requirements, there is a set of plug-ins (plug-ins).  For example, to prevent cases when a customer signed up and didn‚Äôt come, you can turn on the ‚ÄúPay booking‚Äù module and enter prepaid / payment amounts for services.  If payment from the client is not received within a certain period, the reservation will be canceled and other customers will be able to register for this time.  At the moment, automatic payment acceptance via Pay Pal is supported (in the near future, we will add WebMoney, Yandex.Money and other payment systems). <br><br>  Another of the most requested modules is ‚ÄúAdditional Event Fields‚Äù, for example, a private clinic can add a text field to the ‚Äúappointment for consultation‚Äù event in which the client can write in advance his complaints and the nurse will call the patient if necessary and warn the patient about the necessary preparations. before consultation.  Additional attention to customers always has a good response. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d50/6f5/452/d506f545208327c5a83e2c2b3ccb6d97.png"><br><br>  One of the big problems with pre-recording is the human factor - forgetfulness of customers and sometimes even the company‚Äôs employees themselves. In order to have fewer orders failing because of the forgetfulness of customers or employees, we automatically sent mobile reminders in the form of SMS about an upcoming meeting.  All SMS messages that the system will send to customers and employees are easily configured and can be disabled. <br><br><h4>  Future plans </h4><br>  Soon <a href="http://zabroniruy.com/">Zabroniruy.com</a> will be able to receive money from such systems: WebMoney, Yandex, and others, a mobile version of the site will appear. <br>  In the near future we will create plugins for CMS Drupal, Wordpress and Joomla for conveniently connecting the pre-recording module to an already existing site. <br>  Social opportunities will also be added: rating of companies, customer reviews, using their service, advanced company search in the catalog. <br><br>  We are ready to cooperate with any companies that are interested in our project. <br><br><h4>  Access </h4><br>  Registration and access to the system are absolutely free until the end of the summer.  If you want to use SMS notifications, you will have to pay for the SMS package.  Unfortunately, we cannot send SMS. <br><br>  The page with demo access without registering <a href="http://zabroniruy.com/about/demo">here</a> . <br><br>  I would very much like to read in the comments the evaluation of the project and comments on the implementation. <br><br>  PS before writing this topic conducted a <a href="http://mmib.habrahabr.ru/blog/93656/">survey</a> in Habr√©, here are the results <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/043/063/4bc/0430634bc7e55481984574c7262e947a.png"><br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : updated localization files </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93752/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93752/</a></p>
