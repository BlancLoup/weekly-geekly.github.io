One day, working with tables will lead to a dead end - there will be too much information: there will be problems with finding, maintaining clients - then the business goes to the CRM system. <br><br>  But here the problems are just beginning, because most of the modern CRM is a set of functions in a trendy minimalist style: contacts, companies, business, calendar ‚Äî such a funny dashboard, simple and clear.  In such boxed systems it is convenient to lead customers, set tasks, schedule meetings - but this is not for everyone.

    <p>  Below we will deal with the fact that what to do if the ‚Äúboxes‚Äù are not enough, and how to automate more complex business processes than editing the client‚Äôs card. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10e/4cb/cba/10e4cbcba2762744120a8c41dcbbd1f6.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What is missing in the boxes </h3><br>  Boxed CRM is a system with a standard set of functions.  Of course, if the program code is open, it can be supplemented, but for this, again, it is necessary to involve specialists. <br><br>  At the initial stage of working with such a CRM, you will have to adjust the entire business under its limitations, compress processes due to the lack of opportunities.  Obviously, in the case of some niches, this is simply irrelevant.  If the company has a large enough staff with unique business processes - there is no point in introducing a box.  The problem is that when creating such tools, developers are trying to find a universal model that fits the market as a whole, without taking into account narrow niches. <br><br><p>  So, in general, it is clear that the main drawback of closed CRM is the inability to adapt it specifically for your business.  Even if at the initial stage your tasks were completely solved in such a system, as the enterprise grows, many problems will arise;  the main one is that you cannot add unique processes, which slows down progress. </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f4/91f/534/0f491f534d6cabd65f6a21ec1eea8f95.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><br><h3>  Solve problems using the platform </h3><br><br>  Before proceeding further, we will try to determine a platform that may suit you. <br><br><p>  Below we consider several well-known vendors, as an example: </p><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">CRM Salesforce</a> </h4><br>  The platform is provided only by subscription - within the framework of the PaaS concept.  Depending on its level, different technical capabilities and support capabilities are available. <br><br>  For development, Salesforce uses the Apex language, and works exclusively on the SaaS model.  Design is based on their own means: Visualforce. <br><br>  They also have Data.com, a cloud-based DBMS that is suitable for their applications or projects that are not tied to the system.  A good solution has been implemented for working on the interface design - Lightning Components, with it you can create an interface and logic of a web application using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.  The tariff depends on the possibility of refinement and the number of tables per user, access, and so on. <br><br><p>  Salesforce is a fairly expensive system;  If you decide on its implementation, it is worthwhile to calculate the costs for completion or the salary of a full-time programmer.  However, this is not the only solution: there are Russian options that are more adapted to our reporting and integration with accounting systems. </p><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.terrasoft.ru/">CRM Terrasoft</a> </h4><br>  Terrasoft gives customers an alternative in the form of two types of platforms: the first is for development on the desktop (Terrasoft 3.X), and bpm'online for web applications. <br><br>  In the first case, with the desktop platform, you can create modules and configurations, change functionality.  Terrasoft IDE 3.X has the tools for visual development, as well as the database query designer, report designer, windows and others.  All these configuration elements are stored in the DBMS, and the user is shown only a fraction of the changed meta-data. <br><br>  Applications can be deployed under the control of MS SQL Server, Oracle or Firebird, and SSL is supported for web services.  With Tearrasoft 3.X, you can build integrations with third-party applications. <br><br><p>  Terrasoft is one of the most expensive Russian CRM systems.  In addition, the platform is available only to those who have already purchased a license.  However, the advantage of Terrasoft is in the ease of use of the platform. </p><br><br><h4>  <a href="http://sysclick.ru/">Client-Communicator</a> (‚ÄúClick Systems‚Äù) </h4><br>  This system is much cheaper than Terrasoft, although more complicated in terms of interface.  However, this is one of the first CRM in the Russian market, offering a platform for refinement with deep customization of applications.  In addition, there is already a raw but quite functional web-version of the system for working in a browser. <br><br>  For the finalization of the web version, CliC uses a form designer, which allows you to create solutions from simple tables related to the system database to web applications.  Both configurations for Windows and web users work in a single on-line database.  In principle, the solution is very good and requires fairly standard knowledge (you do not have to overpay for the unique skills of the hired specialist), but it is also inert from the point of view of the technologies used. <br><br>  A click is good because it provides the most extensive customization options and, at the same time, requires the user to master the standard skills.  Among the shortcomings - obsession with Microsoft technologies, the use of heavyweight MS SQL DBMS. <br><br>  Those who do not have the opportunity to refine the system, this can be done by Clic for 2500 rubles per hour.  However, prior to implementation, plan a refinement and estimate the total cost of the implementation project. <br><br><p>  ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/277791/">Post, from where information is partially taken</a> ) </p><br><p>  All this is just one of the most popular vendors.  With a careful approach to the selection, you can find the most suitable option. </p><br><br><h3>  Stages of CRM setup and implementation </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6c/720/32a/a6c72032a18b4385655a7696578a6595.jpg" alt="image"></p><br>  To configure your system - you must follow the basic steps: <br><br>  1. The first thing to deal with is to select the most basic business processes, and formalize them;  that is, to prescribe a sequence of actions: input, output, metrics (KPI) of the process. <br><br>  2. Above, we have already figured out the fact for which enterprises the platform solution is right.  At this stage, we solve this issue completely.  Suppose if you choose the platform option - find out whether the vendor already has a ready box based on the platform already configured for your niche business processes, or will you have to develop it from scratch. <br><br>  3. Create a project concept - here you need to clearly define the objectives of the implementation of CRM.  All other details will come from goals: what should be personal accounts, functional modules and so on.  Next, we determine the parameters of the project - it is the budget, the timing, the choice of contractor. <br><br>  4. Implementation of the project.  It is very important to determine the rules of interaction with the contractor, to give a competent technical task, and then to control the process of work.  In order to get what you want from the development team, it is important to pay attention to the technical task;  With the help of mind maps, for example, you can make it more visual. <br><br>  5. The penultimate stage is testing.  Before starting work with the system, it is necessary to test the operation of all functions: track the results and correct problems after the fact. <br><br><p>  6. And most importantly - employee training: direct implementation.  If possible, arrange for training with the developers, because this is almost the most important element of the entire project.  From how quickly employees will be guided in the new conditions - it depends on what the final result will be. </p><br><br><h3>  How much will it all cost? </h3><br>  As a rule, the full cost of a CRM system consists of several parts: <br><br><ul><li>  The cost of the license (acquisition).  This may be an access fee or the cost of one copy per workplace. <br><br></li><li>  Transfer data to the system.  Transferring your data is necessary if it is not your first system, and you are already working at least some time.  Therefore, the presence or absence of a finished module, as well as the difficulty of preparing data for import, will also affect the final amount. <br><br></li><li>  The cost of refinement.  Even if you have completely set up the system, improvements cannot be avoided: at the very beginning, as you work, some processes will change to more efficient ones, so it is important to take these costs into account. <br><br></li><li>  Maintenance Cost </li></ul><br>  In addition to the money invested in the development and implementation, there is one nuance that many miss - financial losses at the stage of transition to the new system.  You need to understand in advance that during the start of work in the CRM-system - there are often problems, the results of which you can lose leads. <br><br>  When implementing any software, there are some difficulties.  Even if the vendor of a software product tells you that it is enough to pay and you can start working right away, problems still occur in practice, problems, mainly due to the human factor (employees are still not coping well with the new system). <br><br>  Also, unplanned expenses are possible during the implementation period.  Most likely, your employees will spend time on training and testing the system, instead of performing their duties.  Also, the manager will be forced to devote part of his work time to solving issues related to the implementation of CRM, as well as to supervising work on solving this task. <br><br><p>  If you understand in advance that the costs at the implementation stage are sure to be, if you are ready for the need to allocate time and effort to implement a CRM system, if you are ready for possible overlays, all these costs can be minimized, and the process can be made as simple as possible and painless. </p><br>  <b>License cost</b> <br><br>  Depending on which CRM you have chosen, there are various options for purchasing a license.  You can: <br><br><p></p><ul><li>  Buy a perpetual license </li><li>  Pay on time (month, year) </li><li>  Purchase a copy to install on your server </li><li>  A perpetual license is paid once, and is permanent.  This is convenient, however it often happens that the amount for the redemption is quite significant <br></li></ul><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  Investment in the platform always pays off, because the business grows - and the platform CRM grows with it.  The developers adapt all the functions of the system, improve the automation of the client‚Äôs enterprise, and this process is continuous;  unlike boxed systems, changes in which occur only in those moments when it is necessary for the market as a whole.  In the case of them, there is no question of personalization of speech; these are simple, but limited in their capabilities, tools that over time come to lose.  Losses are those businesses that are already accustomed to the box, but have already outgrown it. <br><br>  Therefore, for a business that has the potential to grow into something large and complex, it makes sense at the beginning of its development to set up a system that will always be clearly calibrated for the necessary processes.  A system that grows with a business, and always meets its needs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334070/</a></p>
