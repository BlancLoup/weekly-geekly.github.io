  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reshuffle in the largest IT and media companies in Russia and the world in two weeks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The past two weeks (April 4-15) were saturated with noticeable personnel changes.  Public attention was attracted not only by changes in the staff of the largest IT companies and media resources in Russia, but also by companies from the USA. <br><br>  Someone left, barely starting a new job.  And someone worked for a long time in one place and went to do their own projects "for those with eggs." <br><br>  Someone wanted to enter the "international arena."  Someone, to the surprise of the public, was lured from a large arena to a more modest one.

      "Megamind" invites readers to recall these events and make a "commit" of the changes that have occurred. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. The director for business development of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambler%2526Co">Rambler &amp; Co was</a> <a href="https://roem.ru/06-04-2016/221994/rambler-turkevich/">appointed a</a> native of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Electronics">LG,</a> Dmitry Turkevich.  Turkevich will create and develop new channels to monetize current products of the Rambler &amp; Co company group, as well as launch new ones.  The main focus will be on the development of B2C revenues in the framework of cooperation with offline industries. <br><br>  Turkevich himself called his main task in the new position ‚Äúthe creation of interesting products for the user, high-tech and not burdened by a large amount of advertising formats.‚Äù <br><br>  2. Yevgeny Lisovsky <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eugene.lisovskiy/posts/10156596101595478">moved</a> from the company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581">"Litres"</a> (online library) to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maps.me">Maps.me</a> service: <br><blockquote>  Friends, I made a difficult, but important decision for myself to leave Litres and head the international company MAPS.ME as part of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail.Ru_Group">Mail.ru Group</a> . <br><br>  For me, this is growth and an excellent opportunity to use the accumulated experience in the international arena, and in the future, in 3-4 years, to immerse myself in biotechnological startups.  I believe that in these 4.5 years my mission to liters has been completed.  During this time, the entire friendly team of Lithuania has achieved 18x growth (MoM), has attracted 23 million users, has created comfortable <br>  applications and went to the operating profit. </blockquote>  In Litres, Lisovsky was a marketing director. <br><br>  3. Anton Mostovoy <a href="https://roem.ru/11-04-2016/222179/mostovoy-nct/">became the</a> Commercial Director of <a href="http://www.ncloudtech.ru/">‚ÄúNew Cloud Technologies‚Äù</a> (the developer of the MoiOffice office suite).  Previously, he was responsible for the direction of the system architecture and strategy at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> . <br><br>  At Microsoft, Mostovoy was engaged in the development of the company's competence centers, implemented the project of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">Rostelecom</a> National Cloud Platform, and also coordinated interaction with Russian Railways.  Before Microsoft, Mostovoy developed information, infrastructure and engineering systems for Vnukovo Airport. <br><br>  4. Former director general of the <a href="http://www.yota.ru/">Yota</a> cellular operator, Anatoly Smorgonsky, is <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/04/11/637111-tele2-ushel-anatolii-smorgonskii-otvechavshii-proekti-mvno">leaving</a> Tele2.  He <a href="https://roem.ru/14-01-2016/216602/from-yota-with-love/">started</a> working there only from December 2015. <br><br>  Smorgon had to create some kind of universal solution that would simplify the creation of virtual operators based on the Tele2 network.  He helped develop a strategy for providing services to mobile virtual network operators (MVNE), and in January 2016 headed this project. <br><br>  The first MVNOs on Tele2 were to open Rostelecom and Er-Telecom, but both virtual operators were in the design stage.  Now work on the MVNO in the company is in question. <br><br>  5. Elena Torshina <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100000860804180/posts/1055678894470794/%3Fpnref%3Dstory">announced her</a> departure from <a href="https://seopult.ru/">SeoPult</a> for the sake of her own project.  Elena Torshina was engaged in the development of content marketing in SeoPult.  She will work on her own project, but will maintain a partnership with SeoPult in terms of creative marketing. <br><br>  Torshina noted that she was not going to hire after SeoPult: <br><blockquote>  Well, what is hiring after SeoPult?  SeoPult kept me kingly.  It's like going to eat watermelon after honey.  Look at the market.  Well, where to go?  In large offices?  This is not for me.  I am not a declared person, as they see my site there they will be blind.  Or in advertising agencies?  And why should I?  People come to me, I have methods, brains, experience, honesty and modesty.  I myself as an agency. <br><br>  I, in general, will continue to engage in the support of entrepreneurs in digital, so that decent people can get something commercially valuable from here.  But I plan to harness a very limited number of projects.  Firstly, because I have not unlimited possibilities of my working group.  Secondly, I‚Äôm set up, honestly, to weed out requests from the ‚ÄúLena, help me sell the fennel crop in the fall‚Äù series and deal with something more interesting.  And thirdly, because I want to do marketing services for those with eggs.  And there have never been many. </blockquote><br><h4>  Shortage </h4><br>  Traditional channels for hiring at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Yandex have not</a> fully loaded the company with candidates and the search engineer's personnel has time to review additional resumes.  Yandex has <a href="https://yandex.ru/blog/company/kogo-vy-nam-porekomenduete">declared</a> its readiness to pay 100 thousand rubles to those who will bring developers to the Android or iOS office. <br><br>  The search engine used to pay premiums when current employees recommended their acquaintances for hire.  Now we are talking about payments to "external" people in relation to Yandex. <br><br>  The described model is already known in Russia on the example of the work of the heading agency <a href="http://pruffi.ru/">‚ÄúPruffy‚Äù</a> Alena Vladimirskaya.  Depending on the importance of the employee ‚ÄúPr√ºffy‚Äù pays voluntary advisers, both larger and smaller than 100 thousand rubles. <br><br><h4>  Expanding boundaries </h4><br>  1. Shares of the manufacturer of cameras for extreme shooting <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPro">GoPro</a> significantly increased in price.  The company <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/gopro-stock-rocketed-up-19-percent-2016-4">announced</a> the hiring of a member of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">Apple</a> design team. <br><br>  Daniel Koster, who participated in the design of iPhone smartphones, a wireless keyboard for the iPad and some other Apple products, will take the position of vice president of design for GoPro. <br><br>  As part of GoPro, Daniel Koster will be responsible for all aspects of hardware design, software and services.  The company calls the top manager "the main member of Apple's elite industrial design team with more than 20 years of experience." <br><br>  2. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25558/">lured</a> vice president of advanced technology and projects to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> Regina Dugan.  As part of Facebook, Regina will lead a new group called Building 8, which will be responsible for developing experimental equipment. <br><br>  Previously, she was engaged in similar activities in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola">Motorola</a> - Google owned this company for 3 years, then sold it to China.  From summer 2009 to spring 2012, Regina Dugan was the director of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590">DARPA</a> , the agency of advanced defense research projects of the US Department of Defense, where she dealt, in particular, with the problems of Afghanistan. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300172/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300172/</a></p>
