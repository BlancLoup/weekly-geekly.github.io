We will try to answer it today.  For starters, here it is, and then, if it is interesting, we will get to the exams for Gagarin. <br><br>  And, by the way, this is the first welcome post from the company (and portal) <a href="http://westudy.in/">WeStudy.in</a> : <br>  Since we are about education (primarily abroad), we are going to write about all the most interesting things: universities, training programs, the admission process, the opportunity to receive a scholarship or grant, internships and ... and, in general, a lot -Many things. <br><br>  We looked at what was interesting for Habra and us, and we chose these topics for the start: <br>  <b>- Rocketry</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Robots</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- DIY</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Well, something about programming, of course (so that at least 1 out of 4 was about code and coffee!)</b>

Some enthusiasts quite successfully launch home-made devices and clearly document everything.  Fortunately, the Russian traditions are the most traditions, who still have, for example, Tsiolkovsky? <br>  And where to go to do rocket science professionally?  In this post, we will look at educational programs on rocket science in Russia and abroad, what they are taught there, what documents are needed for admission, how many places and what documents you will need. <br>  Of course, this year it is already too late to enter Russian universities, for example, the reception of documents is over, but the next year ... :) <br><br><h1>  Russia </h1><br>  <b>Moscow State Technical University.</b>  <b>Bauman</b> (MSTU them. Bauman) and the faculty of " <a href="http://www.bmstu.ru:8090/mstu/info/faculty/rkt/">Rocket-space technology</a> ", founded in 1956.

It is clear that for all serious programs VERY good English is required, and confirmed by a certificate.  And just like that, with a swoop, you cannot enter one of the three main universities that we have selected - you need systematic preparation (by the way, we can help with this) and a lot of patience. <br><br>  <b>Massachusetts University of Technology</b> (MIT) and the <a href="http://aeroastro.mit.edu/">Aerospace Faculty</a> are the oldest and most respected aerospace program in the United States.  The first courses began to be read in 1924.  The faculty actively collaborates with NASA and the US Department of Defense, which provide funding and jobs for students.  MIT needs no special presentation, it's Mecca, of its kind.  Directions of research and training (given in the English version, for the standard): <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Communications and Networks <br>  ‚Ä¢ Controls <br>  ‚Ä¢ Humans in Aerospace <br>  ‚Ä¢ Materials and Structures <br>  ‚Ä¢ Space Propulsion <br>  ‚Ä¢ Space Systems <br><br>  Deadline for submission of documents: until December 15. <br><br>  Tuition: 63.110 dollars (per year) <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Documents for admission</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚Ä¢ Online application; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Original and notarized copies of the certificate with the translation; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Certificate of English proficiency TOEFL / IELTS; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Motivation letter; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Letters of recommendation; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Copies of the passport (Russian and foreign). </div></div><br><br>  <b>The University of Colorado at Boulder</b> and the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/">Aerospace Engineering</a> Program. <br>  The faculty trains 250 graduate students and 400 students.  The faculty maintains an extensive student funding system.  Good for everyone, though in Canada it's cool (but for Russians it is not the biggest obstacle).  The main research and teaching directions: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Aerospace engineering systems <br>  ‚Ä¢ Aerodynamic and satellite navigation systems <br>  ‚Ä¢ Bioastronavtika <br>  ‚Ä¢ Space sciences and remote sensors <br><br>  Deadline for submission of documents: until December 1. <br><br>  Tuition: 34.097 dollars (not Canada, and the United States) per year. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Documents for admission</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚Ä¢ Online application; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Notarized translation of the certificate and akdemicheskogo extract; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Letters of recommendation; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Essay on a given topic; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Copy of international passport; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Certificate of proficiency in English (TOEFL / IELTS) and the SAT / ACT exam; <br>  ‚Ä¢ A statement about the ability to pay at least a year of study and accommodation. </div></div><br><br>  <b>Indian University of Technology</b> , Bombay and <a href="http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/">Aerospace Engineering</a> .  Especially good for those who, in parallel with sending people into space, dream of sending themselves to Nirvana;) India after all. <br>  The faculty was founded in 1965, has several laboratories in the field of aerodynamics and control systems, an advanced training center.  The university actively conducts research activities, supports a large number of projects sponsored by ARDB, ADA, ISRO, DST, AICTE, MHRD. <br><br>  Deadline for submission of documents: until January 3. <br><br>  Tuition fee: US $ 90,000 <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Documents for admission</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚Ä¢ Online application; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Original and notarized copies of the certificate with the translation; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Certificate of English proficiency TOEFL / IELTS; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Copies of the passport (Russian and foreign). </div></div><br>  Of course, this is not all possible programs related to rocket science, but we have tried to select the best of them.  Make global conclusions yourself, but we will make a trivial conclusion - although there is a small layer of dust and historicity on our Russian rocket science programs, and foreign programs shine like a new cent, this does not mean that somewhere is better, and somewhere worse to learn.  Everyone chooses for himself. <br><br>  Naturally, if the Habrocosmosociety will have additions, comments or suggestions, it will be great to add something to the list or what to say in the future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188998/</a></p>
