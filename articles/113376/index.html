However, we all know what happens to this beauty not only in a month, but in a week of active use.  No napkins can be saved enough to make the laptop look not stained, but still so chic. <br>  So what to do with this gloss, except how to buy cleaning products and those napkins?  As an option - throw away sell and buy a matte.  But what if you like this model for the rest of the parameters? <br>  Another way out - oshkurit and turn into matte.  Do you have the skills to work out neatly and without injuries for your favorite technique? <br>  And of course, you can simply ignore that every touch leaves traces on the lid of the laptop, and do fingerprinting at your leisure: Who touched my laptop?  Who sat on my chair?  And also forget about the charming small scratches, which will eventually become very noticeable on a glossy surface. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I want to offer another way to protect a glossy laptop from their own and others' tracks - its painting.  In addition to protecting against scratches and masking of touch marks, the drawing will be a unique design for a laptop. <br><br>  And all is not so difficult to do as it seems at first glance.

      You will need: <br>  - glossy laptop (although it can be normal), 1 piece; <br>  - hands are skillful and not very skillful, 2 pieces; <br>  - napkin "farewell", 1 piece; <br>  - and the most difficult - stained glass paints, which are sold in stores for children's creativity, in stationery stores.  In specialized art salons, traditionally there are no such ‚Äúamateurish‚Äù paints (not to be confused with paints on glass, which are not suitable for painting a notebook). <br><br>  <b>Some practical tips:</b> <br><br>  <b>1. Select a color.</b>  Stained paints become transparent after drying, so, for example, on a black laptop all colorful colors will turn black. <br>  Black glossy surfaces look best on black: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4be/f75/07c/4bef7507cc8c52e3a5a08b188d85f82b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f9d/1a2/fa9/f9d1a2fa9ef117e56fbd8de4ad621418.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfc/ef2/7cb/dfcef27cbb333a15e2c6e0d28f6dea2a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It also looks very nice gold and silver (used special contour stained glass paint): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/968/85b/9ab/96885b9abb8fb9d130e2cbcb39d26513.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a1/223/090/8a12230906df19bf75322939fb747b61.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On black, you can experiment with white, but perhaps in this case the drawing will have to be applied in 2-3 layers so that the color becomes saturated white: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3fc/1b0/87b/3fc1b087b46474daa1d647b27bc678cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On light notebooks, the choice of color is much wider - any one fits.  For example: not a glossy, but light silver Sony Vaio laptop: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/709/9ae/ef6/7099aeef632ebaa96529b2cbfa9b3253.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the same color surfaces suitable paint in the background color or tone is darker: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfa/1ee/e2d/bfa1eee2dbdd6b64d3a2684a3e799fd2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/51a/a7c/34d/51aa7c34d7e9523900b2207123ff5ec0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Such paints keep quite well (with active use and transportation without a cover and a special bag - up to a year), they do not damage the surface and can be removed mechanically without a trace.  The picture is volumetric and textured.  And, it is important to note that these paints do not require special drawing skills. <br>  In our stores there are several manufacturers (ranked by quality and price): <br>  - "Amos glass" (expensive, but they are worth it: more resistant and homogeneous); <br>  - "Window paints" and "Ray" (also a very good option, but less resistant to external influences); <br>  - ‚ÄúOrange Elephant‚Äù and ‚ÄúGamma‚Äù (the domestic manufacturer, in principle, is also suitable). <br><br>  <b>2. What exactly to draw?</b>  In order to most effectively protect the surface from traces and scratches, it is worth making a pattern over the entire surface of the laptop.  You should not completely paint over the entire surface.  Start with ornaments of simple shapes - circles, squares, triangles.  For example, some simple patterns: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/723/c5a/b8a/723c5ab8a22765c7b5abef98e3314d6f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For example, on a glossy surface, black on black looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e76/708/ef5/e76708ef548f71da5d427ec443557454.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can resize the shapes to get an interesting effect: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f81/40d/bc5/f8140dbc5535a2281968f7cac450af60.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Imitation of the skin can be obtained by drawing just such a simple grid: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39a/bdd/d0b/39abddd0bdb87532c706c96fa79c43a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can also use abstract patterns: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef5/4f4/40a/ef54f440afdac54f7e160f4fc7e9c6f7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad6/e13/e4b/ad6e13e4bc9764056f5b11534665f958.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, then - how will the fantasy: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dcb/85f/ef4/dcb85fef4af4a1c82c02bf8429f5368a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11f/072/4ff/11f0724ff194870a6acf4252c1d0e435.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Tip for owners of matte laptops: you can transfer the printed pattern to the surface of the laptop using a carbon copy.  And on the matte surfaces a pencil drawing is visible through the stencil. <br><br>  <b>3. How to draw?</b>  Before starting work, it is necessary to treat the entire surface of the cover with a napkin with any cleaning agent.  Suitable alcohol, office cleaning detergent for the monitor.  Wipe and dry thoroughly before applying paint. <br>  Drawing the simplest drawing on the laptop takes from one hour.  Dry paint 30-50 minutes.  Allow the pattern to dry thoroughly before putting it in a case or bag.  The longer it dries, the better it will fall on the laptop. <br>  If you accidentally make a mistake or smear the picture, it is better to wait until it dries, pick up the edge with a fingernail and gently remove the damaged piece from the surface.  You can also erase the failed part of the picture in the ‚Äúraw‚Äù state with a napkin with the same cleaning agent. <br>  The most important thing in drawing is to have fun.  Be calm if something does not work: you can always erase and draw again. <br><br>  <b>4. Finally, a few words about exploitation.</b>  The first time (at least a week), take care of your laptop so that the picture is fixed on the surface.  Try to use the case, while it is not necessary to strongly press the design to the surfaces of the bag. <br>  If you suddenly notice that the pattern has caught and started to fly off, this can be easily corrected: put a piece of the pattern in place, press it firmly and smooth it out. <br>  Such drawings are afraid of moisture and only in very large quantities, but you are not going to soak your laptop in a basin? <br>  When wearing a picture for more than a year, it is possible that after removal, the surface unprotected by the pattern will be more polished than the surface under the pattern, but this is more likely for matte laptops.  In addition, literally after a week of use, the surface is flattened and traces of the pattern disappear completely. <br><br>  More photos, drawings, ideas for painting notebooks can be found on <a href="http://www.cosharika.com/">my website</a> . <br>  Good luck in the experiments! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113376/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113376/</a></p>
