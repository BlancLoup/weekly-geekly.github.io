  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Six errors freelancers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I collected and summarized the six most common mistakes that freelancers make when trying to get an order on freelance stock exchanges. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I took this selection from the materials of my seminar for freelancers, which will be held in August, but I thought that if I share some of the information with everyone, it will not make me :) <br>  All of the following applies primarily to novice freelancers.  Although "the old woman is prorukha", no one is immune from this. <br><br>  So, errors: <br><br><h4>  Inattention to ad text </h4><br>  Meets pretty often.  The simplest example: I always specify a contact e-mail and ask to answer precisely there (so that all contacts are in the mailer).  Nevertheless, approximately 30% of responses go only in the personal account of the exchange, without duplication with the mail.  It's clear that these responses are filtered - if a person is not able to understand even a simple ad request, how to build work with him? <br>  The more carefully you read the ad, the better you will understand what is required, as well as whether it is worth it to respond to this ad. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <h4>  Response to obviously inappropriate suggestions </h4><br>  Announcement read.  Your experience or qualifications do not match what is required.  No need to respond!  No need to send texts like "I have never done it, but I will try it with pleasure" (also comes regularly).  At best, you just will not answer.  At worst - you will be able to get this order and you will have real problems with its implementation.  Therefore, only respond to those ads for which you are absolutely confident in your qualifications. <br>  The same applies to those ads that do not fit you under the conditions (money, terms).  No need to respond, and then try to "bend" the customer - most likely it will end in mutual displeasure, but you will spend time and nerves on it, and in return you will not get anything. <br><br><h4>  Response without response </h4><br>  Many freelancers believe that ‚Äúresponding‚Äù is something like ‚Äúmark territory‚Äù.  The main thing is to nickname flashed.  Eighty percent of responses are ‚Äúresponses without response‚Äù, messages worthy of Laconics: ‚ÄúI will do it!‚Äù, ‚ÄúContact me, no problem,‚Äù ‚ÄúI did many things, and I will do it to you!‚Äù  It is assumed that the customer, having seen one or two of these words, will melt and immediately order a lot and expensively.  No, will not order.  Give the customer more information about yourself, let him see and feel that it is you who can solve his problem.  Show understanding of the question, tell about your experience in relation to this task, ask questions.  Do not force the customer to do extra work, look for information in your profile - for a more or less decent job receives such a number of responses that it is simply physically difficult to see the profile of each and remember it all.  As a result, the one who provides the best service wins. <br><br>  The correct response (in the case of a reply to the mail) should look something like this: <br><br>  - Presentation (Hello, my name is, the reason for the appeal, a little about myself in the context of the announcement, links to the site, works in the portfolio related to the announcement) <br><br>  - The clarifying part (asking questions that the performer would like to clarify for himself) <br><br>  - Signature (not ‚ÄúYour Friend‚Äù or ‚ÄúWith Greetings, Vanya!‚Äù, But a normal signature with a normal name, contacts, etc.). <br><br>  When answering directly in the project, you should briefly mention the experience relating to the project and, if possible, provide links to specific works in the portfolio. <br><br><h4>  Knowingly humiliated position </h4><br>  Already, unfortunately, a layer of freelancers has formed, who consider themselves not to be the professionals the client needs, but rather obedient performers of the royal will.  In such responses, the readiness to work in any schedule, the consent to any vagaries of the customer (the number of edits, options, lifetime guarantees for the result, etc.).  However, this is what you need to fight in yourself: such an approach scares off normal customers, but in abundance attracts all evil spirits - those who like to approve themselves at the expense of others.  As a result, the interaction from the plane of professional communication goes into the category of sado-masochistic games.  So if you go to freelancing for work and money, and not for all kinds of perversions, initially take a weighted calm position of a professional who knows the value of himself and the time - both his own and the client. <br><br><h4>  Attempts to deliberate dumping </h4><br>  Item closely related to the previous one.  Almost on any announcement come the responses like ‚ÄúI'll do it at half the appointed cost‚Äù.  These people believe that for the customer, except for the price, nothing matters.  This is despite the fact that the customer has already named the amount with which he is willing to part.  This approach leads to sad consequences.  Distinct and efficient customers for such proposals are not conducted - there is too much risk of a non-professional approach on the part of the performer who values ‚Äã‚Äãhimself so low.  But all those who like to lick their heels for a penny will be yours.  Do you need it? <br><br><h4>  Pseudo dignity </h4><br>  The reverse side of the previous paragraphs.  Some freelancers see self-worth as a must-see for a client.  Most often, this is a result of some previous negative experience - ‚Äúburned with milk ...‚Äù In such responses there is a protrusion of one‚Äôs own professionalism with the client‚Äôs notorious suspicion of incompetence and malicious intent.  Do I have to say that this also does not contribute to the making of a contact?  The correct approach in this case is to provide the client with the service and convenience, but without the ‚Äúsagging‚Äù.  This is the dignity of a professional. <br><br>  Here are six mistakes that freelancers most often make when responding.  When you respond to a new project - think about whether you are doing one of them?  I would be glad if this brief review will help you increase your income. <br><br>  <i>The note is based on the materials of the seminar ‚ÄúLife in freelancing: how to get clients of your dreams and work for your pleasure‚Äù</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66390/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66390/</a></p>
