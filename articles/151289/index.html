Fell into the trap of a life-track, approved by society, as a standard: school =&gt; institute =&gt; employment.  Someone immediately went into freelancing or business. <br><br>  But not always the choice is made consciously. <br>  In this article I will try to objectively consider the pros and cons of each organizational form of self-realization so that such a choice can be made.  Personally, after a deep rethinking, I quit a promising career and went to my startup.

      Let us proceed to a comparison of the set of parameters, which I consider the most important, all evaluations are subjective - based on my own work experience in hiring + business, as well as the work experience of my freelance friends. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Employment </h2><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dimmick/118883365/" title="Workplace Fatality by Bill Dimmick, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/235/472/170/235472170a577a56a5a441746c741462.jpg" width="500" height="375" title="Workplace Fatality by Bill Dimmick, on Flickr" alt="Workplace Fatality"></a> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>- The amount of income is</b> fixed by the labor market.  Increase your income 10 times is possible, 100 is almost unreal. </li><li>  <b>+ The stability of income</b> , which facilitates budget planning, creates a sense of confidence. </li><li>  <b>+ Social guarantees</b> - the employer often includes in the social package medical insurance, expenses for food, communication, transportation. </li><li>  <b>+ Training</b> at the expense of the employer - either directly, with attendance at courses or within a company, or independently, but in paid time. </li><li>  <b>+ A team</b> that often gives not only communication, support, but also friends. </li><li>  <b>- The work schedule</b> , even if flexible, usually implies a minimum of 40 hours of work per week. </li><li>  <b>- Rest</b> is usually limited to 4 weeks, and even with coordination (and the more valuable you are, the more difficult) with the boss, in most cases you can forget about the <b>geocorrection</b> . </li><li>  <b>- Freedom of creativity is</b> strongly limited by the scope of tasks coming from above. </li></ul><br><h2>  Freelance </h2><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smemon/6426455183/" title="Home Office by Sean MacEntee, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/127/e40/d3c/127e40d3c63aa9633fc7558f57d930af.jpg" width="500" height="374" title="Home Office by Sean MacEntee, on Flickr" alt="Home Office"></a> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>- The size of the income is</b> again fixed by the labor market, but it may well exceed the income from work for an uncle. </li><li>  <b>- The stability of income is</b> lower than in employment, highly dependent on your qualifications and ability to present it. </li><li>  <b>- Social guarantees</b> - all expenses fall on your shoulders. </li><li>  <b>- Training</b> at your expense, the client will not pay for it. </li><li>  <b>- The team is</b> missing, which means lack of support and communication. </li><li>  <b>+ Schedule</b> you define yourself.  The client, of course, sets deadlines, but you have the right to decide what time of day / week you should work. </li><li>  <b>+ Rest, geocorrection</b> - up to you.  Do you want to work hard for 1-2 months, and then rest for six months?  This option is quite real. </li><li>  <b>+ Freedom of creativity is</b> fixed within the scope of the client‚Äôs tasks, but you choose the projects yourself! </li></ul><br><h2>  Business </h2><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/frerieke/5607103241/" title="Day 10.04 beach office by Frerieke, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dc0/94c/5f0/dc094c5f05b461b922c734d5baa95a46.jpg" width="500" height="374" title="Day 10.04 beach office by Frerieke, on Flickr" alt="Day 10.04 beach office"></a> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>+ The amount of income is</b> actually unlimited. </li><li>  <b>- The income stability is</b> low, today you can be a millionaire, and tomorrow you can be a beggar. </li><li>  <b>- Social guarantees</b> - all expenses fall on your shoulders. </li><li>  <b>- Training</b> at your expense. </li><li>  <b>+</b> You choose the <b>team</b> yourself, however, you can do without it. </li><li>  <b>+ The work schedule is</b> completely yours. </li><li>  <b>+ Rest</b> with proper automation can be permanent;  <b>geocorrection</b> in the case of online business is almost inevitable, there are many places on Earth where it is much cheaper and more pleasant to live. </li><li>  <b>+ Freedom of creativity</b> reaches its climax - you can set a task for yourself, choose the way to solve it, and enjoy receiving feedback from the client. </li></ul><br>  It is necessary to understand that the <b>importance of each of the factors for each person has its own</b> .  A set of factors may also differ. <br><br>  To find out what suits you best, I suggest filling out a table.  In my case, it looks like this: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Parameter</b> </td><td>  <b>Significance coefficient</b> </td><td>  <b>Employment</b> </td><td>  <b>Freelance</b> </td><td>  <b>Business</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Income </td><td>  3 </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Income stability </td><td>  2 </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Social guarantees </td><td>  one </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Training </td><td>  2 </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Team </td><td>  2 </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Schedule </td><td>  four </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Rest, geocorrection </td><td>  four </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Freedom of creativity </td><td>  four </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Total</b> </td><td></td><td>  -eight </td><td>  2 </td><td>  12 </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Change the coefficient of significance of the parameter and count the total amount in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub%3Fkey%3D0Ao4KR2WUHQrkdGRwTjRaRUpUZ282eXJhSGJNcjlXNkE%26output%3Dxls">your plate</a> . <br><br>  This will give you an initial understanding of where you are and where to go. <br><br><h2>  What to do if there is no possibility to change the form of activity? </h2><br>  I do not advise to drop everything immediately.  Think it over, <u>connect your intuition</u> .  In your free time, take tentative steps exploring the new soil. <br><br><h2>  How to improve life right now </h2><br>  Each of the considered minuses can be leveled, or even completely put in plus. <br><br><h3>  Employment </h3><br><ul><li>  <b>Income size</b> : think how much money you lack for a comfortable life?  Perhaps employment will more than provide this level.  Update your resume, go to interviews, talk to your boss about growth opportunities - this will give you an understanding of what you are worth and what you can achieve. </li><li>  <b>Schedule</b> : make it flexible by agreement with the boss, or changing jobs. </li><li>  <b>Rest, geocorrection</b> : find a job on the contract.  It is not without its drawbacks (lack of social guarantees), but at the end of the project you can rest as you like.  Organize yourself a remote job, perhaps working by the sea is more productive for you? </li><li>  <b>Freedom of creativity</b> : become a highly qualified specialist, creative tasks will be available an order of magnitude more (simply because no one else can solve them).  Become a leader - you can distribute tasks yourself, including yourself. </li></ul><br><h3>  Freelance </h3><br><ul><li>  <b>Income stability</b> : find clients for monthly maintenance. </li><li>  <b>Social guarantees</b> : earn more, spend less with the help of a geocorrection, create a PI for contributions to the Pension Fund. </li><li>  <b>Training</b> : Allocate time for self-education, there are enough materials in the network, even professors from leading American universities already conduct free online training ( <a href="http://coursera.org/">Coursera</a> , <a href="http://venturelab.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> ). </li><li>  <b>Team</b> : during working hours, communicate with like-minded people in specialized forums, in your free time with friends, the benefit of which time will be more. </li><li>  <b>Income size</b> : improve your skills, learn English, register on freelance exchanges, turn out reviews.  On the same <a href="http://odesk.com/">Odessa, a</a> programmer‚Äôs income of $ 50 / hour is considered normal. </li></ul><br><h3>  Business </h3><br><ul><li>  <b>Income stability</b> : provide yourself with several (for risk diversification) large customers, and best of all build a business according to the subscription model. </li><li>  <b>Social guarantees</b> : similar to freelancing. </li><li>  <b>Training</b> : similar to freelancing. </li></ul><br><br>  PS Share, what are the most important parameters in choosing for you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151289/</a></p>
