No, nebilo and there would be no one who would exist without interaction with something: for example, you eat pasta - the interface is a spoon (anticipating some dissatisfaction - yes, yes! The spoon is not an interface, but an input tool, well, we don‚Äôt to mention, okay - you understand what I mean) within this stream of consciousness (ESSE - I said this - ESSE) we will talk about the human-computer interface (although this is not quite true, but let's kill this brace bore and continue) so today we are talking about chki. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This interface is designed to interact with the person and the computer.  Mogiy without even thinking about using this or that interface when working with electronics, in particular, with a computer.  For example, this text was written entirely using a graphical window interface, and just a few years ago (this way), the author of this essay used a text-based interface, and perhaps a few years later, or he will use another interface right away tomorrow (ha ha! already use, and not the first year!).  Recent changes in the IT industry have spawned me to write a brief article on changes in the interfaces of the ChKI.  Let's look back carefully - a few decades ago, people used text interfaces and did not think about anything more - typing information and commands from the keyboard seemed to be the most convenient and the only correct one, the use of other interfaces seemed to be wasteful of machine resources and slowing down obscenity.  However, nothing prevented Xerox from creating a mouse and a graphical user interface in their laboratories, although the founding fathers were not particularly astute and the great idea was snagged Apple - a young and ambitious organization intending to conquer the market (running a little ahead - it managed it, but from the second times).  And what we have - the text interface has fallen! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/c97/3ef/430/c973ef43050e7b3df4a7c3546455f755.png" alt="image">

      Long live the new king - a graphical window interface.  True text interface is preserved and is alive today, but few people know about it.  Undoubtedly, the console is still an indispensable tool for diagnosing and tuning not only in Linux and BSD but also Windows, but most users are not even aware of its presence under tons of graphics.  Look carefully at the screen of your computer (Linuxsoids - go to see the managers and look at their computers), what do you see?  Despite the many differences depending on the installed OS, you are likely to see a windowed interface with window controls, with tools for creating new windows, regardless of OS and application (Haha, APPLIED) software.  The revolution is just around the corner - be surprised and see - new interfaces are already in front of you! <br><br><h4>  Sign interface </h4><br>  Blah blah Ipad, blah blah bla iphone, android, yes we know, we know ... <br>  Well, you know, well, well done, but the gesture interface is not only famous for gadgets.  The principle of the gestural interface itself is far from new - this interface has been widely exploited in cinematography - for example, the Star Trek series and the film ‚ÄúMinority Opinion‚Äù (sorry, not strong in terms of sins-fiction movies, but if you dig, many other examples of movies in which the characters waving their hands effectively control objects on the screen or holograms).  So what prevented the appearance of the gesture interface?  Yes, nothing hindered, the research began long before the first commercial use of multitouch and not only started, but there were no developments - the first surface with multitouch support appeared in 1985, and the first popular product in which it was used was the Apple iPhone - thus, almost 22 years passed from the moment of its creation to world recognition (and I said that there would be a revolution - well, not 22 years ago, but only two paragraphs above).  Those.  the emergence of new interfaces is mainly hampered by the insufficient level of current technologies, and, as a result, the excessive cost of new solutions in the field of interfaces.  However, only the lazy person is not familiar with the gestural interface now - on any modern phone, it is he who is expensive (Here he is! The interface of my dream!).  What gives us mere mortal users a sign interface?  Screens with multitouch support are focused on direct interaction with the object that is shown on them, i.e.  we get rid of the "middleman".  Previously, everything was simple - the screen (display) is an output device, on it we see an image of an object, and with the help of an input device (keyboard, mouse) we act on it, but now we can just turn such things with the finger that earlier dreamed without a mouse - rotate, scale, move, and when we need a keyboard - it will appear on the same display.  Modern video games have also got gestural interfaces - they don‚Äôt even need to touch anything - it‚Äôs enough to produce gestures in space.  To date, all the leaders of the gaming market have presented their solutions in the field of sign interfaces.  Nintendo was the first to enter the market with the Wii, followed closely by Microsoft with Kinect and Sony with Move.  The Wii remote game controller, ‚Äúseeing‚Äù the infrared lights on the sensor bar connected to the console, determines its position in space.  In Sony Move, the opposite is true: the player holds controllers with luminous lights, and the camera connected to the console watches their position.  The Kinect has a built-in projector that covers the space in front of a matrix of infrared dots, one of the cameras tuned to the desired range picks up their location, and another camera transmits a standard color image to the console.  Also Kinect is equipped with a stereo microphone and servo drive, which corrects the angle of the cameras.  Together, this allows you to truly recognize the images, and not just catch the location of the markers, i.e.  When using Kinect, there is no need to hold something in your hands, but this will not allow creating effective feedback, for example, tactile feedback, which will be discussed below.  How good is the gesture interface?  One can argue about this for a long time, but the fact of huge sales of various gadgets with support for the sign interface, the release of consoles with support for this interface by all titans of the video game market means a sign interface and be healthy.  In addition, Microsoft brings Kinekt to the PC market, and there are ready-made solutions for managing Windows using gestures, for example, Evoluce's development uses Kinect, and is designed for Home Edition and Windows 7 and allows you to control the media player and some of the features of Microsoft Office and PowerPoint.  There <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Do4U1pzVf9hY%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded">is a video on the</a> Internet showing all the advantages of this revolutionary type of management (Um ... I would say all the shoals of this management). <br><br>  However, can the gestural interface completely displace the input-output devices (Aaaaaa !!! Give the keyboard! Where did you drag!? I won't give it!)?  Yes, hardly, something this interface will displace in the near future.  It will just be a great addition to existing ones, for example, let's take the scaling of objects - it will certainly be more convenient to enlarge or reduce the image with a pinch gesture exactly to the size that interests us, the same with the rest of the media content (page turning, scaling, rewinding, etc.), and the text ?  No, we‚Äôll get some text without using gestures with the help of ancient devices, although we may be offered a really worthy alternative (well, let's talk).  In addition, what is good for small displays will not always be good for large ones either. <br><br><img src="http://creep.ru/uploads/posts/2011-04/1301984293_evoluce-winandi-04-03-2011.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Try waving your hands in front of a 50-inch panel for several hours while moving objects (and this is the solution to the managers' fitness problems; you do not need additional expenses for subscriptions).  It was about the same with the mouse - it did not force out the keyboard, but only successfully complemented it.  However, for gadgets like everything has already been decided - the buttons are gone, and gone permanently (Oh, what?) <br><br><h4>  Tactile interface </h4><br>  Unfortunately, the normal definition of this interface was never found, but it is a logical continuation and development of the gesture interface, and it will probably never get its own name, but it will be something like a gesture interface with feedback.  The basic principle of this interface is that, for example, by swiping a finger over the touchscreen surface over an object, tactile sensations are transmitted to you on your fingers (or by what you drive on the touchscreen there).  All this is due to the fact that the interaction with the touch-screen with the help of the gesture interface is not always full for the user, due to the lack of tactile sensations when working with the touch-screen.  (Blah blah. This is Habr, so I would like to insert a couple of paragraphs further with a copy of some tactile interfaces and some technical information. But you can google yourself if you're interested). <br><br>  Among the things that can be touched by mere mortals who do not have special passes to research laboratories are Wii.  In addition to the gestural interface, which is partially implemented and not everywhere, it also implements tactile feedback in the form of vibration when hovering over menu items.  This is certainly not quite what was meant, but you can get a minimal idea. <br><br><h4>  Voice interface </h4><br>  And this type of interface has only recently emerged in a more or less digestible form, in view of the fact that only a lazy person doesn‚Äôt know about Siri, I don‚Äôt see any particular sense of mock up for a long time, in general, there was a car and a trolley for developing voice interfaces, however Reached only Apple and Google.  This interface also stepped right out of science fiction films (albeit, at first, early developments in idealized form stepped into the cinema, and then back into life).  An electronic device to a question asked by voice (not using voice tags, namely, arbitrarily formulated and given), we get an adequate response in the form of text, voice, or links.  The application can gain a truly wide, but also, like the previous types, does not claim to completely replace the old interfaces, but is able to perfectly complement them. <br><br><h4>  Neurocomputer interface </h4><br>  Direct interaction of the brain and the computer, remember I was talking about an intermediary?  A person is lazy by nature, all these mice and multitouch will not be needed if a normal neurocomputer interface is created.  Yes, they have already been created, but by normal we mean this - we thought we would write an annual report - and it was written!  The truth is a bit with the use of the mat, unflattering references to the manual and with elements of porn, but it was written the same!  But at the moment this interface is in the stage of a highly specialized application in the field of medicine for communicating with paralyzed patients, despite the fact that the devices can even be purchased (on Habr√© they have repeatedly <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ui/86761/">written about these devices</a> ). <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  So the dreams came true - everything that we saw only in the cinema is now available wholesale and retail.  Nevertheless, you should not throw out the good old keyboard and mouse, because, like the console in the era of graphical interfaces, it will feel great next door to Kinect, the voice control module and something else they will think of. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137297/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137297/</a></p>
