  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Planetariums of all countries unite</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The problem of piracy almost led to the collapse of the market in the amount of 300 million rubles.  We are talking about mobile planetariums used in school lessons. <br><br>  The market is arranged like this: a private entrepreneur acquires equipment and begins to wander from school to school, demonstrating films purchased from copyright holders for large for small businesses (about 150 thousand rubles).  Naturally, entrepreneurs took the license "in the club" by depriving the right holders of legally earned money.  After some time, content producers for mobile planetariums decided to completely abandon work in Russia, as they did not see the prospects and tools to combat this kind of piracy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 2013, the Novosibirsk company Enter Ideas entered the market, which offered a beautiful saving solution so that the ‚Äúwolves‚Äù (entrepreneurs) were fed and the ‚Äúsheep‚Äù (rights) remained intact.  Enter Ideas, led by a young but already experienced entrepreneur, Igor Mendzebrovsky, proposed a number of technical solutions that not only protect the rights of content makers, but also significantly improve the product itself. <br><br>  The scheme of the product is simple.  The entrepreneur purchases a set of equipment: an iPad, a BenQ projector and an inflatable dome.  The projector is enhanced by a special unit that allows you to play video only from the tablet that comes in the kit.  The projector does not work without a tablet.  Data on the number of demonstrations of content is open to the copyright holder, and payment is made not for a license for a year, but for one display.  Implemented Enter Ideas scheme, on the one hand, guarantees full respect for the rights of content creators, and on the other - a significant reduction in costs for the entrepreneur.

      <b>SK: Igor, tell us how you position your system on the market?</b> <br>  I.M .: We work with a network of dealers of our system <a href="http://www.enterideas.ru/">www.enterideas.ru</a> and with customers who already use first-generation single-channel systems and with those who are just entering the business. <br>  For each category we have our own offer.  For the first and second, we supply only a projection system: a control module implemented on an iPad basis and a projection module based on a BenQ projector with our integrated solution, as well as a detailed manual and a case for transportation are supplied.  For the third category, we deliver a turnkey solution (ready-made business), this is our system, audio system and dome, which serves as a screen for it. <br><br>  <b>SK: How did the content producers react to your proposed solution?</b> <br>  I.M .: In different ways, honestly ... I would say that the movement was diversified, smaller companies gladly accepted our offer because we opened for them the previously inaccessible market segment of Russia and the CIS countries.  Large companies were wary, someone took a break to look at the product, I personally brought the system to someone in the USA for tests.  But in general, everything is developing well, we are moving, according to our plan. <br><br>  <b>SK: What is the economics of the project?</b> <br>  I.M .: It is very interesting here - I take the data from entrepreneurs from download statistics - we have champions who produce 6 impressions a day, in money it‚Äôs about 3,000 rubles per display, and as you can see, the math is quite simple.  The average work time per month is 22 days.  Minus the cost of a license, logistics, taxes and rent.  The guys get to earn up to 200 000 rubles per month with a seasonality of 8-9 months, which, you see, turns out pretty well. <br>  As for the authors of the content, they get a good profit, which comes to them not in large payments, but very stable.  It turns out that they sold not one license for a year for $ 5,000, but 30 for 500. <br>  We also built our system in such a way that any content producer can place his work there and put on it, the value that he deems necessary.  And now the producers of our domestic content began to come to the system. <br><br>  <b>SK: You were a member of GenerationS-2013.</b>  <b>Tell us how it affected the project?</b> <br>  IM: My participation in the competition has brought a lot of benefit to the company, I remember that we reshaped some of the decisions online: I broadcast in Moscow, Alexey changes in Novosibirsk.  For example, I was able to communicate on Mentors Day with a very cool specialist and, following the results of this meeting, we restructured the business model. <br><br>  We also understood that when the system was technically a server, we could not provide the necessary level of protection for the authors and decided to switch to a wireless image transfer protocol.  This meant starting a specific segment of the development of both hardware and software from scratch.  The team, especially our guys engineers and programmers, ‚Äúcried‚Äù at nights.  And during the final packaging of the project with the guys from Spinverse Russia, tons of coffee were drunk and thousands of copies were broken until we arrived at the right decision.  Thank you for this Masha, Oleg and Mikko!  (Employees of the Finnish company Spinverse, who helped in the final preparation of the project). <br><br>  <b>SK: Igor, give advice what to do to start your business?</b> <br>  IM: I can advise you not to be afraid and never stop, in my life there were good businesses that brought good income, were not successful, and lost a couple of millions, but never give up.  I have never understood the teams that run and are looking for an investor in their business, while they are afraid just to take a bank loan for their idea ... probably, they don‚Äôt believe in it themselves.  From my own experience I will say that some ideas need to be buried in time so that they do not bury you.  And then everything will be fine with you, and you will build your business, and you will receive cool job offers. <br><br>  Interview for the GenerationS contest was taken by Sergey Kokarev. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17e/abd/4c2/17eabd4c2e9e8dce7d8a6a3400481927.png">  " </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224311/</a></p>
