These are reliable "workhorses" that are designed for small and medium businesses.  Servers from the Gen9 model range proved to be a good idea for solving various simple tasks, which, as a rule, are accompanied by a small budget.  The heirs of the Compaq brand, they are worthy of keeping up in comparison with the more powerful counterparts and proudly bear the name of Hewlett Packard, so well known in the "server" world. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26c/0e2/861/26c0e28614f582f7f5e1cb1d087498d6.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  However, quite the lyrics.  Meet the heroes of our material today: HP ProLiant DL60 and DL80 Gen9, designed to be placed in the rack, and the ‚Äútwo towers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãto the delight of Tolkien‚Äôs Lord of the Rings fans: HP ProLiant ML10 v2 and HP ProLiant ML110 Gen9.  The first three are related to the HP ProLiant 10 series, which was added to the HP server directory quite recently, with the result that these models simply do not have predecessors from the eighth generation.  As for the HP ProLiant ML110 Gen9 server, it is one of the youngest representatives of the ‚Äúhundredth‚Äù series, which is positioned by the company as the ‚Äúfirst server‚Äù for those companies where previously only desktop computers were used. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you know, HP currently manufactures products for three series: 10, 100 and 300, which differ in design, reliability and power. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <b>Series 10</b> <br></td><td>  <b>100 series</b> <br></td><td>  <b>300 series</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Chassis depth</b> <br></td><td>  Up to 24 inches <br></td><td>  Up to 24 inches <br></td><td>  Standard <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>CPU limitations</b> <br></td><td>  there is <br>  (heat dissipation up to 105 W) <br></td><td>  there is <br>  (heat dissipation up to 105 W) <br></td><td>  Not <br>  (heat dissipation up to 145 W) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>RAM</b> <br></td><td>  Up to 8 slots (DDR4 modules) <br></td><td>  Up to 16 slots (DDR4 modules) <br></td><td>  Up to 24 slots (DDR4 modules) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Cooling system</b> <br></td><td>  Hot swap support, redundancy possible <br></td><td>  Hot swap support, redundancy possible <br></td><td>  Hot swap support, mandatory backup <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Network support</b> <br></td><td>  2x1 Gbps;  Flexible LOM (riser) - depends on model <br></td><td>  2x1 Gbps;  Flexible LOM (riser) - depends on model <br></td><td>  4x1 Gbps;  Flexible LOM (matplata) - depends on the model <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Disk subsystem</b> <br></td><td>  Built-in SATA controller;  PCI-e Smart Array / HBA Cards - depending on model <br></td><td>  Integrated SATA controller, PCI-e Smart Array / HBA Cards - depending on model <br></td><td>  Integrated SATA controller, Flexible Smart Array / PCI-e card - depends on model <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>The possibility of expanding the disk subsystem</b> <br></td><td>  + <br></td><td>  + + <br></td><td>  + + + <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>GPU support</b> <br></td><td>  No / Partial <br></td><td>  Partial <br></td><td>  Complete <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>PCI-e slots</b> <br></td><td>  + <br></td><td>  + + <br></td><td>  + + + <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Power Supply</b> <br></td><td>  Standard, redundancy and hot swap - depending on model <br></td><td>  Standard, redundancy and hot swap - depending on model <br></td><td>  Flex Slot Hot Swap <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Warranty period, years (parts / replacement / on-site service)</b> <br></td><td>  1/1/1 <br></td><td>  3/1/1 <br></td><td>  3/3/3 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The junior series features a compact size (small racks up to 24 inches are used for placement) and a simplified cooling subsystem, which dictates restrictions for the use of powerful processors.  At the same time, talking about a weak ‚Äústuffing‚Äù is inappropriate, because the new servers are based on Intel Haswell microprocessor microarchitecture, as a result of which even the 12-core Intel Xeon E5 2660 is supported in the third generation.  In addition, the presence of 8 slots for DDR4 memory modules allows, with a limit of 32 GB per bar, to pump the system up to 256 GB and even split threads when using dual-processor models that are available along with single-processor servers. <br><br>  If we talk about network capabilities, the models of the tenth series are equipped with two built-in gigabit Ethernet ports.  At the request of the user, the server functionality can be extended with the help of separate network PCI cards and adapters.  HP has also built in a software v140i raid controller, which provides support for out-of-box drives with a SATA interface, with the result that the user can not worry about a separate purchase of the module and the corresponding license for its full operation.  If you really need a high-performance solution and support for SAS disks, you can purchase, for example, an HP Smart Array controller or a bus host adapter (HBA), which allows you to realize the capabilities of a RAID controller.

      Of the minuses of the lower series, for example, a limited number of slots for the PCI-E standard and the absence of embedded solutions of this kind on the mainboard can be noted.  However, those tasks that the younger members of the HP ProLiant server line are designed to solve, and do not require the connection of a large number of additional modules, for this there is the same 300 series where you can install network cards without using any PCI-Express slots. <br><br>  Let's now take a closer look at the servers themselves. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">HP ProLiant DL60 Gen 9</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76f/e2a/29e/76fe2a29eb204f808ea511c6d6d1543b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ¬ª <a href="http://www8.hp.com/ru/ru/products/proliant-servers/product-detail.html%3Foid%3D7500984">Product page on the official website</a> <br><br>  One of the most affordable representatives of the ‚Äútenth‚Äù series is great for small and medium businesses that require a server for dedicated hosting and typical business applications.  The model is also used to solve various simple tasks: printing, various file processing, message exchange. <br>  In addition, HP ProLiant DL60 Gen 9 has worked well in the cloud and user collaboration.  Despite its low cost, the server is equipped with basic monitoring and management tools that are typically found in models for the corporate sector. <br><br>  <b>Main technical characteristics:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Processor: Intel Xeon E5-2600v3 - x2 </li><li>  RAM: 32 GB DDR4 DIMM - x8 (up to 256 GB in total) </li><li>  Disk controller: HP Dynamic Smart Array B140i </li><li>  Network: 1Gb x2 ‚Äã‚Äã+ FlexibleLOM optional </li><li>  Drives: HDD / SSD - x4 LFF (3,5 "') </li><li>  Management: HP iLO 4 (v.2.0), UEFI </li><li>  Power supply: 80+ Gold, second power supply unit - optional </li><li>  PCI: PCIe x3 </li><li>  Warranty: 1/1/1 </li></ul><br>  The model is made in the 1U form factor and can work with two processors (the limit is 12 cores and 105 W heat release for each chip).  Eight slots for DDR4 SmartMemory modules allow you to install up to 256 GB of memory with the prospect of increasing to 512 GB in the very near future, when modules of 64 GB each will be presented. <br><br>  Up to 4 large-format disks ‚Äî 3.5 inches (LFF) are supported, and both hard drives and solid-state drives (SSD) can be used.  Here, as in all models of the ninth generation of servers, the standard tools are used: iLO 4 (iLO Management and Intelligent Provisioning), UEFI BIOS and REST API, which allows using HP ProLiant DL60 Gen 9 in large quantities, for example, when creating server servers. farms <br><br>  An optional power supply is available with features such as redundancy and hot swapping.  We also note the possibility of installing a second 80+ Gold power supply unit for an additional fee.  As for the warranty, everything is simple - one year for each type of free services from the manufacturer, which traditionally includes the repair of components, replacement and on-site service. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">HP ProLiant DL80 Gen 9</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c3d/045/486/c3d04548640f484e9feeb0c8a0759c99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ¬ª <a href="http://www8.hp.com/ru/ru/products/proliant-servers/product-detail.html%3Foid%3D7500985">Product page on the official website</a> <br><br>  The two-unit HP ProLiant DL80 Gen9 server from the ‚Äútenth‚Äù series, like its ‚Äúbrother‚Äù HP ProLiant DL60 Gen 9, has an attractive price and good capabilities.  The developer positions it as an affordable storage server with a low cost of data storage (at the rate of 1 GB). <br><br>  This model can be used as a mail or file server, as well as a domain controller, it will cope with most small business operations and basic tasks of the web and IT infrastructure.  One of the advantages of HP ProLiant DL80 Gen9 is that with the licensed software from Hewlett-Packard, the server can be used to efficiently store data.  So, with the HP StoreOnce VSA utility, this model becomes a disk system for backup storage, and thanks to HP StoreVirtual, you can implement network storage.  In this case, you will get a good list of corporate functions. <br><br>  <b>Main technical characteristics:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Processor: Intel Xeon E5-2600v3 - x2 </li><li>  RAM: 32 GB DDR4 DIMM - x8 (up to 256 GB in total) </li><li>  Disk controller: HP Dynamic Smart Array B140i </li><li>  Network: 1Gb x2 ‚Äã‚Äã+ FlexibleLOM optional </li><li>  Drives: HDD / SSD - x12 LFF (3,5 "') </li><li>  Management: HP iLO 4 (v.2.0), UEFI </li><li>  Power supply: 80+ Gold, second power supply unit - optional </li><li>  PCI: PCIe x6 </li><li>  Warranty: 1/1/1 </li></ul><br>  As you may have noticed, the vast majority of server specifications coincide with the parameters of the younger model, which is not surprising.  The main difference here is the 2U form factor, thanks to which you can install up to 12 ‚Äúlarge-format‚Äù LFF and SSD hard drives.  Due to this, the ProLiant DL80 Gen 9 server will ‚Äúmake friends‚Äù with particularly ‚Äúvoracious‚Äù applications, which need a lot of disk space to install normal operation.  Also, this low-cost model has three PCIe slots more than the HP ProLiant DL60 Gen 9 - a total of 6. <br><br>  The manufacturer gives a one-year warranty on components and the same on servicing and replacing the server. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">HP ProLiant ML110 Gen9</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b6/368/ba9/4b6368ba920945013dc34bc79fd6b2bc.jpg" alt="image" align="left" width="300">  ¬ª <a href="http://www8.hp.com/ru/ru/products/proliant-servers/product-detail.html%3Foid%3D7796454">Product page on the official website</a> <br><br>  This tower model is an excellent server solution for small and medium-sized enterprises due to its compact size, almost silent operation and the possibilities for inexpensively expanding functionality.  As it was mentioned at the very beginning of our review, the server received the title of <s>‚Äúfirst guy in the region‚Äù</s> from the light hand of marketers <s>,</s> ‚Äúthe first server in the enterprise‚Äù, which can be very useful if a small company needs to switch to a full-fledged server. <br><br>  Despite the small size of the case, the height of which is 4.5U, the server‚Äôs specifications leave the most pleasant impression: the user has 8 slots for memory modules with a maximum capacity of 256 GB, up to 5 PCIe slots, up to 8 LFF format disks or up to 16 SFF disks. <br><br>  As the "heart" of the tower server, two third-generation Intel Xeon processors are offered - E5-2600 or E5-1600.  The latter, as a rule, has a smaller number of cores, however, it compensates for this disadvantage with higher CPU frequencies. <br><br>  Let's compare the HP ProLiant ML110 Gen9 model with its predecessor, the ML310e Gen8 v2 model, which represents the eighth generation of Hewlett-Packard servers. <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <b>HP ProLiant ML310e Gen8 v2</b> <br></td><td>  <b>HP ProLiant ML110 Gen9</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>CPU</b> <br></td><td>  Intel Xeon E3-1200 (v.3);  kernels - 2/4 <br></td><td>  Intel Xeon E5-2600 (v.3) / E5-1600 (v.3);  kernels - 4/6/8/10 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>RAM</b> <br></td><td>  4 slots DDR3 (max. 32 GB);  up to 1333 MHz <br></td><td>  8 slots DDR4 (max. 256 GB);  up to 2133 MHz <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Disk controller</b> <br></td><td>  Built-in HP Dynamic Smart Array B120i;  HP Smart Array - optional <br></td><td>  Integrated HP Dynamic Smart Array B140i, HP Smart Array and HP Smart HBA - optional <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Cache</b> <br></td><td>  512Mb FBWC SATA <br></td><td>  Optional <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>I / O (PCI-e)</b> <br></td><td>  PCIe 2.0 x2 + PCIe 3.0 x2 <br></td><td>  PCIe 3.0 x5 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Battery</b> <br></td><td>  Not <br></td><td>  Optional <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Network support</b> <br></td><td>  Built-in 1GbE x2 module <br></td><td>  Built-in 1GbE x2 module <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Disk support</b> <br></td><td>  8 SFF / 4 LFF, HDD / SSD <br></td><td>  16 SFF / 8 LFF (hot swap) / 4 LFF (without);  SATA / SAS;  HDD / SSD <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>GPU</b> <br></td><td>  Yes (Built-in) <br></td><td>  Optional (150 W) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Interfaces</b> <br></td><td>  VGA, Serial Port, USB x8, Micro-SD <br></td><td>  VGA, USB x8, Micro-SD <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Control</b> <br></td><td>  HP iLO Management Engine <br></td><td>  HP iLO 4 (also HP iLO Essentials), HP SUM, UEFI, HP Intelligent Provisioning <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Power and cooling</b> <br></td><td>  Efficiency up to 92% <br></td><td>  Efficiency up to 92%;  350 W / 550 W, 750 W (duplication) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Certification</b> <br></td><td>  Not <br></td><td>  ASHRAE A3 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Chassis format</b> <br></td><td>  18.7 inches <br></td><td>  Less than 19 inches <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Warranty period, years (parts / replacement / on-site service)</b> <br></td><td>  1/1/1 <br></td><td>  3/1/1 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The main difference that catches your eye is, of course, processors.  Curiously, the model E3-1200, which was used in the model HP Proliant ML310e Gen8 v2, is a slightly improved version of the desktop processor Core i3, which is much worse optimized for ‚Äúserver‚Äù work than the new E3-1600 CPU and E5-2600.  Also, the transition to DDR4 memory and the 8-fold increase in maximum capacity from 32 GB to 256 GB have also had a favorable effect on increasing the performance of the new model. <br><br>  Another major change is the increase in the number of disks that can be installed into the system, exactly 2 times.  The ability to connect 16 SFF format drives inspires respect for this inexpensive server.  We also note the ‚Äúgraphical‚Äù potential of the new model - at the request of the client, the server can be equipped, for example, with Nvidia video cards.  As a result of significant changes regarding server functionality, the size of the case has also increased, but at the same time the possibility of rack installation has remained. <br><br>  Thanks to the certification of the American standard ASHRAE A3, the server can be used without problems at temperatures up to 40 degrees Celsius and relative humidity up to 85%.  Of course, it is desirable to provide HP ProLiant ML110 Gen9 models with more comfortable operating conditions, but you can be sure that the data is safe even on the hottest days, say, during the repair of a domestic air conditioner. <br><br>  <b>Main technical characteristics:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Processor: Intel Xeon E5-1600v3 / E5-2600v3 </li><li>  RAM: 32 GB DDR4 DIMM - x8 (up to 256 GB in total) </li><li>  Disk controller: HP Dynamic Smart Array B140i, HP Smart Array / HBA - optional </li><li>  Network: 1Gb x2 </li><li>  Drives: HDD / SSD - x8 LFF (3.5 "') / x16 SFF (2.5"') </li><li>  Management: HP iLO 4, HP SUM / SPP, UEFI, HP Intelligent Provisioning </li><li>  Power supply: 80+ Gold x2, multi-channel output </li><li>  PCI: PCIe 3.0 x5 </li><li>  Warranty: 3/1/1 </li></ul><br>  Now is the time to briefly talk about the appearance of the server.  The manufacturer produces two different chassis, sharpened for use with disks of different form factor, that is, the user chooses in advance which drives he will work with - SFF or LFF.  In addition to the numerous disk slots, you can also see a special slot for installing an optical drive on the front panel of the HP ProLiant ML110 Gen9, as well as 2 USB ports 3.0 at the bottom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/055/ddf/377/055ddf377186cc4c5bdf55229daa0578.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The arrangement of components inside the case is standard, and attention is drawn to the heatsink of impressive dimensions, designed for passive cooling of the processor.  In general, there are no complaints about the implementation of CO: in addition to the main case cooler, there is a possibility to install additional fans in the center and the bottom of the chassis - in case of adding a large number of drives and connecting ‚Äúhot‚Äù expansion modules (for example, video cards). <br><br>  On the back panel, as a rule, there is a bundle of two power supplies with a simple status indication system, a VGA video output, USB ports and 2 network interfaces.  At the bottom is a dedicated iLO port, which you can use to set up a separate network through which all traffic will go to manage the server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76d/de0/119/76dde01194493c3470e6b4523442aac8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">HP ProLiant ML10 v2</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a44/e4a/183/a44e4a1839699650d351a4b1f02c0995.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  ¬ª <a href="http//www8.hp.com/ru/ru/products/proliant-servers/product-detail.html%3Foid%3D7796450">Product page on the official website</a> <br><br>  This budget option, made in the Tower format, is designed for start-up companies, being an effective solution for small corporate networks.  Contrary to the low price, HP ProLiant ML10 v2 provides an adequate level of fault tolerance, the possibility of flexible server configuration and expansion slots for building storage systems.  The server is equipped with a third-generation Intel Xeon E3-1200 processor (up to 4 cores are supported).  HP ProLiant ML10 v2 allows you to use up to 4 DDR3 memory modules, through which the maximum amount of 32 GB is achieved.  It is also worth mentioning the ability to connect an impressive amount of 3.5-inch (LFF format) disks - 6 pieces.  Server management is carried out using proprietary software iLO Management 4. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that the case and all the main characteristics of this model are completely borrowed from the HP ProLiant ML310e Gen8 eighth generation, which we have already described, comparing the latter with its follower, model ML110 Gen9. <br><br>  If we are talking about comparing servers, let's take a look at the technical data of HP ProLiant ML10 v2 and its predecessor, model ML10. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>X</b> <br></td><td>  <b>HP ProLiant ML10</b> <br></td><td>  <b>HP ProLiant ML10 v2</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>CPU</b> <br></td><td>  Intel Xeon E3-1200 (v.2);  kernels - 2/4 <br></td><td>  Intel Xeon E3-1200 (v.3);  kernels - 2/4 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>RAM</b> <br></td><td>  4 slots DDR3 (max. 32 GB);  up to 1600 MHz <br></td><td>  4 slots DDR3 (max. 32 GB);  up to 1600 MHz <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Disk controller</b> <br></td><td>  HP Dynamic Smart Array B110i RAID 0/1/10 <br></td><td>  HP Dynamic Smart Array B120i RAID 0/1/10 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>I / O (PCI-e)</b> <br></td><td>  PCIe 2.0 x4 <br></td><td>  PCIe 2.0 x2 + PCIe 3.0 x2 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Network support</b> <br></td><td>  Built-in 112i 1GbE x2 module <br></td><td>  Built-in 332i 1GbE x2 module <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Disk support</b> <br></td><td>  4 LFF;  HDD <br></td><td>  6 LFF;  HDD <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>GPU</b> <br></td><td>  Not <br></td><td>  Optional <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Interfaces</b> <br></td><td>  VGA, USB x7 (2.0) <br></td><td>  VGA, USB x4 (3.0 x2 / 2.0 x2) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Control</b> <br></td><td>  HP iLO 3, HP SUM <br></td><td>  HP iLO 4 (optional HP iLO Essentials), HP SUM <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Power and cooling</b> <br></td><td>  Efficiency up to 85% <br></td><td>  Efficiency up to 85% <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Certification</b> <br></td><td>  Not <br></td><td>  FCC Class B <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Chassis format</b> <br></td><td>  15 inches <br></td><td>  18.71 inches <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Warranty period, years (parts / replacement / on-site service)</b> <br></td><td>  1/1/1 <br></td><td>  100 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  As you can see, the updated HP ProLiant ML10 v2 model received a slightly modified design, acquired USB 3.0 ports, a new 332i network card, and support for more disks.  The changes also affected the warranty support model.  In an effort to make the server as accessible as possible for purchase, the company made decisions to remove the possibility of free maintenance of the model on the user's territory from the basic guarantee package, that is, if there were any problems with the product, the client would have to visit the Hewlett-Packard service center. <br>  However, this inconvenience is partially compensated by the presence of a special set of components available only for the HP ProLiant ML10 v2 model at a special, reduced price.  Thanks to this innovation, the user can significantly reduce server maintenance costs. <br><br>  <b>Main technical characteristics:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Processor: Intel Xeon E5-1200v3 </li><li>  RAM: 8 GB DDR3 DIMM - x4 (up to 32 GB in total) </li><li>  Disk controller: HP Dynamic Smart Array B140i, HP Smart HBA - optional </li><li>  Network: 1Gb x2 </li><li>  Drives: HDD / SSD - x6 LFF (3,5 "') </li><li>  Control: HP iLO 4, HP SUM </li><li>  Power supply: 80+, multi-channel output </li><li>  PCI: PCIe x4 (PCIe 2.0 x2 + PCIe 3.0 x2) </li><li>  Warranty: 1/0/0 </li></ul><br>  Let's take a closer look at the server.  There is a storage basket on the front panel (unfortunately, hot swapping is not supported).  Here you can fit 4 disks, another 2 pieces can be installed in the corresponding slots located in the upper part.  Alternatively, they can also be used to install an optical drive.  If it is necessary to use 6 disks and DVD-ROM, for the latter there is an option of internal connection using special tapes.  Behind the cabinet grille located power supply and system cooler.  In addition, there are 4 USB ports of different standards (2.0 and 3.0), 2 network interfaces and a VGA video output on the back panel.  At the bottom of the port can optionally be located iLO.  Unlike its senior counterparts, this server does not support the ability to allocate a separate channel for ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù traffic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b15/1e4/170/b151e41704aabbed5038ebe5a798f22b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you look inside the server, the power supply case located in the upper part of the case and the passive cooling system of the CPU, which hides the HP SmartSocket, a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù socket designed by the company to prevent the processor from being installed, as a result of which the latter often legs break.  Previously, it was considered one of the most common problems that forced users to contact support.  Thanks to a new solution, HP has managed to significantly reduce the number of such incidents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d78/2b0/3a2/d782b03a2110d3be09765dcd511707b9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The last two servers we reviewed (ML110 Gen9 and ML10 v2) can boast of full support for all current versions of the Windows Server operating system, including the 2008 R2 distribution.  The required certification passed modern versions of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu. <br><br>  In addition, the informal community, consisting of owners and ‚Äúserver‚Äù enthusiasts, successfully tested several Windows desktop operating systems, including, for example, the very popular Windows 7 on the models provided in our review. In addition, the performance of various Linux distributions was confirmed as well as systems such as CentOS, Fedora, Asianux and others.  The current list can always be found on <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/servers/management/operating-environments/os-support-matrix.html">this</a> page from the official site. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">List of officially supported OS</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Microsoft:</b> <br>  - Windows Server 2008 R2 <br>  - Windows Server 2012 R2 <br>  - Windows Server 2012 <br><br>  <b>Linux:</b> <br>  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5, 6.6, 7.0, 7.1 <br>  - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11, 12 <br>  - Ubuntu <br><br>  <b>VMware (virtualization)</b> <br>  - VMware vSphere 5.1 U3 <br>  - VMware vSphere 5.5 U2 <br>  - VMware vSphere 6.0 <br><br>  <b>Citrix (virtualization)</b> <br>  - Citrix XenServer </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">List of unofficially supported OS</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  - Windows (desktop versions) <br>  - Oracle Linux <br>  - Debian <br>  - CentOS <br>  - Fedora <br>  - openSUSE <br>  - Asianux </div></div><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">At last</font> </h2><br>  All of the above servers are equipped with built-in HP Intelligent Provisioning technology that allows you to quickly deploy a server and easily configure the system.  You do not need to use traditional disks with the HP SmartStart utility, since all software and drivers are already pre-installed on the servers.  USB keys and Scripting Toolkits for Windows and Linux operating systems, as well as iLO (Integrated-Lights Out) technology can be used for deployment. <br><br>  Server drivers and firmware are updated using HP Smart Update Manager technology and HP Service Pack for ProLiant servers.  Since the update package has the latest drivers and firmware for a wide list of servers of different generations, the image is suitable for updating the ‚Äúdisparate‚Äù server infrastructure of enterprises, which simplifies the work and saves engineers time. <br><br>  Thanks to the HP Care Pack Next Business Day proprietary package, the installation of the server, as well as the diagnostics of the problems that have arisen, are carried out on the next business day after contacting the manufacturer's support service.  And often even the server can be repaired immediately.  If you decide to purchase OEM versions of servers, the manufacturer will also provide a guarantee for the operating system that comes with the product.  Then, troubleshooting issues related to both the ‚Äúiron‚Äù and the software component of the servers will be handled by the unified support service - Hewlett-Packard, which is very convenient for the user.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that servers of the eighth and ninth generations are distinguished by increased reliability and resistance to breakdowns in comparison with their predecessors. <br><br>  With the release of the new HP ProLiant Gen9 server line, the company has expanded the list of budget proposals aimed at small and medium businesses.  In this case, the buyer at an attractive price gets the product, the creation of which used the same production capacity as in the assembly of other more expensive server models.  The manufacturer itself does not reduce the functionality and potential of the ninth generation product control systems. <br><br>  Prepared on materials of the company "Technology and Machines."
