All residents of the Russian Federation, born in 1990 and later, are already <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/screenager.asp">screenshots</a> .

      The best gadget for reading (in terms of screen size and interface development) is an ipad, so I use my ipad for reading.  But he did not leave the guts in the bookstores (16 Gb: not enough!). <br><br>  Hard drives are mortal "and that would be half the trouble.  The bad thing is that they are sometimes suddenly mortal, that's the trick. ‚Äù  (with) <br><br>  Therefore, the unread, 20-30 scheduled to read books soon + FSS favorite authors, always lies in Dropbox.  The main file format (thanks, Flibusta!) Is a weightless epub.  There are both pdf and pdf-scans for 100-200 Mb, but compared to epubs there are so few of them that the Dropbox-segment of the library almost always fits into half a gigabyte (and its duplicate lies on the android phone, the synchronization is once a quarter ). <br><br>  At any moment I take any book from the dropbox and read it with an ipad.  If there is no 3g coverage, which in Moscow only happens on the subway, I read from a smartphone. <br><br>  Favorite authors are always in the dropbox, as they are being read again and again (they would also be in the iPad, have plenty of space and a good manager for ‚Äúmany, many files‚Äù).  But the one-time read (and outlined, but that's another story) books go out of the ‚Äúbox‚Äù and get into the main book depository, in which I experiment with modeling an ideal personal-public library. <br><br>  She is here: <a href="http://mediafire.com/timureading">http://mediafire.com/timureading</a> <br><br>  <b>What is this service good for the reader?</b> <br><br>  1. No download timers, no ads.  Mediafire is a large, experienced, <b>unlimited</b> host with sane service.  Interface nyamnyam. <br><br>  2. Folder structure is supplemented with a very convenient search. <br><br>  3. RSS for folders.  That is, you can subscribe to my personal reader track: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/rss.php%3Fkey%3D69c9xwd536df1">www.mediafire.com/rss.php?key=69c9xwd536df1</a> rss ||  Or only on the thin part, or only on linguistics, etc.  <s>Eh, if my friends followed my example, I would follow everyone through Google Reader and would always know my ‚Äúreading circle‚Äù.</s> <br><br>  4. Fast sharing of links to files, including FB, Twitter, email.  Direct / Hot Linking * and embed codes. <br><br>  <b>How is this service good for a library owner?</b> <br><br>  five*.  When p.4.  tell the legends about my library to copywriters, I can download all the file folders as zip archives.  Now ziping koryavit all Cyrillic names (I will also write to the hoster about this). <br><br>  6. Private folders and password protection <s>so that no one knows that I read the hentai version of ‚ÄúAnna Karenina‚Äù</s> <br><br>  7. No ftp, but there is a desktop uploader that can throw folders with folders with files. <br><br>  eight*.  Download statistics.  You can play power librarian. <br><br>  9. You can install somewhere js-based form "dear friends, fill in the books here and they will fall into a special folder of my library."  I do not use it yet, good good and evil books are sent to me anonymously at timur_up2k@sendtodropbox.com. <br><br>  PS Books delivered to the iPad from Amazon fly past readflow.  This makes the scheme a little less than ideal, but I feel a little more ideal reader, who <s>always</s> honestly pays the authors for their work before reading, and not after. <br><br>  PPS Well, since I used the term ‚Äúperfect‚Äù, then in the comments, the ideas of ‚Äúhow to make more better‚Äù are welcome.  Well, the criticism of the above readflow. <br><br>  * Option pro account, $ 65 per year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138432/</a></p>
