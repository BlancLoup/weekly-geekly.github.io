      The main part of the traffic came on social networks and various Internet resources, including habrabra. <br><br>  After the publication of the video, for several days, we were able to observe the highest jumps in user activity, after which it became moderately stable in the amount of 12-20 views per hour. <br><br>  In general, we are satisfied with the result for three reasons: <br><br>  1) We were able to collect more than a hundred views, so we managed to arouse the interest of a certain number of potential users; <br>  2) Collected a good feedback; <br>  3) We hit the top 10 organic youtube on requests that interest us. <br><br><h3>  Feedback </h3><br><cut></cut>  We received very different reviews, the overwhelming majority of positive ones, but the most interesting now are precisely the argued negative reviews or reviews criticizing specific details.  This allows you to make edits and adjustments in the early stages of development, while the product has not yet been published. <br><br>  We knew about some of them ourselves, for example, the visual component of the gameplay part, on which we are now very actively working.  Someone didn‚Äôt like the music very much, someone didn‚Äôt really like the setting and the style.  These things relate mostly to the preferences of a particular person and, alas, it will not work to adjust them to each. <br><br>  But one question we were asked most often in different variations.  In general denominator, it sounds like this: how does your game differ from other runners?  And indeed, in 20 seconds, to show everything that was intended is simply unrealistic (of course, if you are not developing just a runner). <br><br>  To do this, it was decided to write a brief description of the product and make a separate announcement of the game ahead of the planned date, in which we talk about what the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HMGmonsterbeast/">MonsterBeast</a> project <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HMGmonsterbeast/">really is</a> . <br><br><h3>  Description </h3><br><cut></cut>  The working version looks like this for now: <br><br>  A game: <br>  Genre: 2D runner platformer with RPG elements <br>  Developer: Hell Mushrooms <br>  Release date: September 15, 2017 <br><br>  MonsterBeast is a driving platformer with irony sauce, seasoned with hints and references, and richly watered with hardcore. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Background - an anthropomorphic animal world affected by the infernal virus <br>  ‚Ä¢ The main character is a modified Ostrich <br>  ‚Ä¢ Enemies - beast monsters from a nearby high-tech dimension <br>  ‚Ä¢ The goal is to clear the Earth from the infernal virus. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Means - pump Ostrich, RUN, SHOOT, DESTROY! <br><br>  In MonsterBeast, we have created a world that reflects our modern times. <br>  The grotesque-cartoon world will show the usual and everyday things from a new angle, and hardcore and drive will not let the player get bored. <br>  Even an ordinary Ostrich can become a superhero! <br><br><h3>  Features: </h3><br><cut></cut>  1) Automatic change of direction of running <br>  2) Non-standard management <br>  - One hand controls the character <br>  - The second hand (swipe) kills enemies (like Fruit ninja) <br>  - When you change the direction of running, the control changes (if before that you jumped with your left hand, but you heard it with your right hand, then when you change the direction, your hands will change to the opposite) <br>  3) Boss fights <br>  4) RPG elements <br>  Character will need to be pumped.  The standard four characteristics that we have tried to link as interestingly as possible with the physical capabilities of the character. <br>  The talent branches are not planned yet, but the sets of things will not only visually customize, but also have characteristics.  Each item from the set can be pumped, and the set will give its bonuses. <br>  Separately, it will have a small satellite, which will also have its own characteristics and characteristics. <br>  5) Farm <br>  The player can create his own small "farm" in which various useful things for the character will be made.  The farm can also be improved. <br>  6) Different difficulty of passing, as the player‚Äôs skill sets (changes as desired).  It will be possible to play both on the difficulty comparable to SuperMario and on the complexity of Dark Souls.  Choose you. <br>  7) Daily, wiklik, achivy and quests. <br>  Yes, yes, it will be too. <br>  8) Social component <br>  - Leaderboards <br>  - Competition <br>  - Groups <br>  - Group tasks <br><br><h3>  Gameplay video </h3><br>  In order to convey this information to the general public, we recorded <a href="https://youtu.be/EzIbjrVAcn8">another video clip</a> , where we talk about all this.  The video is in broken English (in which the doctors write and we sing bourgeois songs), but I think that this will not be a problem for our community. <br><br><h3>  Closed alpha </h3><br>  At 15-20 of August, we will conduct closed alpha testing, where we will give the opportunity to try out the mechanics of the game.  For those who want to take part in it, write to the group's messages on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HMGmonsterbeast/">Facebook</a> , we will be happy.  In the text, specify the e-mail and contacts for communication. <br><br><h4>  Coming soon ... </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335330/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335330/</a></p>
