I would like to share the experience gained in the process of delivering a laptop from America.  Instructions under the cut. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Brief background</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  My brother, deciding to change his old laptop, turned to me for help in selecting a model.  In one of the reviews on the site, in the comments slipped such an engineering marvel as the LG Gram.  With a diagonal of 15 inches, this laptop weighs less than a kilogram, has a good stuffing and looks very good.  In Russia, this laptop is not for sale, so the search continued on the site Amazon.  Initially, the model cost about $ 1,100, but I, having years of shopping experience abroad, decided to wait.  As a result, the price fell to $ 830 and it was decided to take.  The laptop successfully arrived at the warehouse of one of the mail-forward services and was ready for shipment.  But here the fun begins.  This email comes to mail: </p><br><blockquote>  Good afternoon,% username%! <br><br>  At the preliminary approval of the data about the sent parcels with the customs, the latter did not approve the sending of the laptop from your parcel # ****** due to the lack of notification of the FSB of the Russian Federation.  Therefore, we will not be able to send such a parcel using the *** method. <br><br>  We are ready to send such a package only by USPS Express / Priority methods without insurance.  However, it is important to understand that in this case there is a risk of returning the goods from customs due to the lack of notification to the device. 
      <br>

      We advise you to cancel sending in the section of the personal account "Packed".  After canceling the shipment, you can re-register the declaration with USPS and create a new outgoing USPS Express / Priority package. <br><br>  Perhaps one of the solutions at the moment will be to return the goods to the seller. </blockquote><p>  I naturally look for information and get to the <a href="https://portal.eaeunion.org/sites/odata/_layouts/15/portal.eec.registry.ui/directoryform.aspx%3Fviewid%3D859ec98d-f4fe-423a-b6bc-d01b53fd4b7c%26listid%3D0e3ead06-5475-466a-a340-6f69c01b5687%26itemid%3D232">ECE</a> site (rather inconvenient, but what to do), which I really don't find this model.  There are 4 possible solutions to the problem: </p><br><ol><li>  Sending by regular mail in the hope that I will be lucky and the customs will not selectively enlighten the parcel </li><li>  Return and receipt of money </li><li>  Notification and import legally </li><li>  In May 2017, another way appeared - services that allow you to import goods through tourists, ordering delivery to their address.  I do not use these, but maybe someone will find it useful </li></ol><br><p>  In general, the brother immediately suggested using the first method, taking all the risk of losing money on himself.  The main disadvantage of this method is that it did not mean full insurance due to frequent thefts at the Russian Post.  This gave an additional chance not to get a laptop.  And I was even more afraid not of customs, but of the Russian Post, since the probability of theft of such equipment there has always been high.  In technical support of the service to get some kind of a clear answer did not work out.  As a result, I had to decide everything myself.  Initially, I offered them to place this article on their website in exchange for a discount in the amount of the sum spent for the paid storage period, but apparently $ 15-20 for them was serious money and they refused. </p><br><p>  A bunch of options were considered, such as shipping through Belarus, Ukraine, followed by delivery by friends, and even such exotic options as shipping a container with spare parts, but all of them were not feasible.  For example, in the Republic of Belarus and in Ukraine, customs limits are below $ 100. </p></div></div><br><p>  So, how to import equipment into the territory of the Russian Federation officially?  There are 2 ways: </p><br><ol><li>  Get FSB Notification </li><li>  Enter as a legal entity or individual entrepreneur </li></ol><br><p>  The first method is practically impossible, or is expensive.  As far as I know, the manufacturer should receive the notification, which is unlikely to do it for you.  On the Internet there are a lot of companies that offer these services, starting from 10000r.  As you know, this option is also not suitable, since it completely kills all the benefits from discounts.  The second option is more interesting.  As you know, legal persons are not only limited liability companies and other companies, but also individual entrepreneurs, which are probably every second IT specialist.  Then I remembered that I, too, had an IP openly and the task was simplified. </p><br><p>  My first trip was in the legal department of customs, which is on the area of ‚Äã‚Äã3 stations.  In addition to a heap of useless information, they told me there that the selection of parcels in customs is quite fast: if the parcel contains the equipment on which the notification should stand, but this notification is not indicated on the parcel, then it is not opened back, since they keep the parcels not provided. </p><br><p>  The next was a call to the FSB, namely, the <a href="http://clsz.fsb.ru/notif.htm">CLCSZ of the FSB of Russia</a> .  I want to say right away that there are quite sane people working there who will explain everything in detail and help you to correctly draw up the documents.  They told me that the individual entrepreneurs could indeed receive permission to import equipment for personal use.  The order is described in <a href="http://clsz.fsb.ru/files/download/reshenie_N_30_prilogenie_N_9.pdf">this document</a> .  To do this, you need to send a letter to the office of the Central Security Service Center of the Federal Security Service of Russia (Moscow. 107031, Bolshaya Lubyanka St., 1/3). </p><br><p>  In the letter you need to invest: </p><br><ol><li>  Application addressed to the head of the Central Service Center of the Federal Security Service of Russia </li><li>  Listing technical characteristics </li><li>  Passport photocopy </li><li>  Photocopy of the certificate of registration of the IP and TIN </li><li>  The completed opinion (Appendix No. 1 to the Decision of the Board of the Eurasian Economic Commission No. 45 of May 16, 2012) </li></ol><br><p>  Perhaps the list is incomplete, it happened more than six months ago, I could have missed something.  It is better to call the Central Security Service of the Federal Security Service of Russia and clarify. </p><br><p>  The application is written in free form, here is what I wrote: </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Statement</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Head of the Center for licensing, certification <br>  and protecting state secrets of the FSB of Russia <br>  Vasyukov Yuri Konstantinovich </p><br><p>  Statement </p><br><p>  I, individual entrepreneur Ivanov Ivan Ivanovich, TIN XXXX, OGRNIP XXXX, PASSPORT DATA, on the basis of Annex No. 9 to the decision of the Eurasian Economic Commission Board of April 30, 2015 No. 30, for my own needs as an individual entrepreneur in the Amazon online store purchased an LG laptop Gram 15 "(model 15Z960). Due to the fact that the manufacturer did not give notification on this model, please give permission to import it. This laptop, based on the specification on the manufacturer‚Äôs website, contains encryption tools included in the WiFi module, module  l Bluetooth (specifications are attached) and Windows XX operating system (specify the notification number from the ECE site). The laptop does not have any other encryption functions. A full list of technical specifications is attached. I need this laptop to solve personal problems as an individual entrepreneur. I undertake to use it only for personal purposes without providing encryption services to third parties. I ask you to give permission to me in my hands (or they will send it by mail to the IP registration address).  Contact phone number XXXX </p><br><p>  06/30/2017 Ivanov Ivan Ivanovich </p></div></div><br><p>  Conclusion can be downloaded <a href="http://www.tsouz.ru/eek/RSEEK/RKEEK/10Z/Documents/P-45-1.pdf">here</a> .  A part of the data is filled in there so that it will not be done in the FSB.  Which ones, I don‚Äôt remember, but by phone in the FSB they will help you fill in all this. </p><br><p>  Then the letter is sent by regular mail and within 30 days they will call you on the contact telephone number and inform you of the decision.  I just want to say that the FSB told me that you should not send it by e-mail, it will be so much longer. </p><br><p> In my case, a positive response came in 3 weeks.  Then you drive to the street.  Yartsevskaya, 30 and get permission (or it will be sent by mail to the registration address of the SP).  Scan permission is embedded in the parcel mail-forward service and frees you from problems with customs. </p><br><p>  I would like to advise everyone (the same was told to me by the FSB), who wants to use this method, to do it before the time of purchase, in order to avoid a long wait.  In my case, I bought a laptop at the end of November 2016, and received it only at the end of March 2017. </p><br><p>  I hope this manual will be useful. </p><br><p>  <strong>UPD:</strong> <br>  In connection with the many comments on the status of IP, I slightly changed the wording of those who can receive notifications. </p><br><p>  <strong>UPD2:</strong> <br>  Even when obtaining permission, I paid attention to the proposal, where it was said that it was recommended for inclusion in the register (I do not remember the exact wording).  Today I discovered that this laptop was officially listed on the <a href="https://portal.eaeunion.org/sites/odata/_layouts/15/Portal.EEC.Registry.UI/DisplayForm.aspx%3FItemId%3D50994%26ListId%3Dd84d16d7-2cc9-4cff-a13b-530f96889dbc">https://portal.eaeunion.org/sites/odata/_layouts/15/Portal.EEC.Registry.UI/DisplayForm.aspx?ItemId=50994&amp;ListId=d84d16d7-2cc-4-4cff -a13b-530f96889dbc</a> Ie those products for which permission was obtained, after some time get into the registry automatically. </p><br><p>  <strong>UPD3:</strong> <br>  According to the information from the FSB, from January 13, amendments will be introduced and limits will be lifted for individuals and it will be possible to import equipment without notification.
