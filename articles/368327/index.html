  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãStory: Mary and the Bulrati</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time there were two elderly Imperials, and they had a granddaughter, Mary. <br>  Somehow friends gathered in deep space on zero-skipping.  They came to call and Mary. <br><br>  They let her grandmother and grandfather let her go, but only asked her to keep up with her girlfriends, and strictly keep the bearing on her home.  She promised - and she forgot right there, in anticipation of the roar of null generators.  So Mary jumped for one star, then for another, then the globular cluster wants to see better - and ended up in the Black Galaxy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  She started calling girlfriends on globalnet, but they don‚Äôt hear, do not get in touch, and they don‚Äôt go out to classmates either. <br>  I tried to jump - en and would not find 5 stars for a zero-jump, only foggy black silhouettes are visible ... <br><br>  Mary turned on the propulsion engines and soon found herself on the Black Planet, in the very center of the Black System. <br>  He sees: there is a mining and processing complex for the extraction of bunker-crystals, the mining cyber is running, and the Bulrati is in command, but what a commander!  Shaggy, huge, shaggy black wool, fangs yellow and growls!  He saw Mary, caught the gravel and was delighted! <br>  - Yeah, he says - now I will not let you go.  You will live with me!  For a nuclear reactor to look after, cyborgs repair!

      Here Mary, of course, was very sorry that she didn‚Äôt have a prolonged after Disneyland.  She began to live at the Bulrati, but at the mining plant ... <br>  He will leave for the whole day to walk around the planet, and Mary punishes strictly not to leave the airlock.  And if you leave, ‚Äùhe says,‚Äú all the same, you will not live ‚Äî there is a Black Fog all around, he will eat you. ‚Äù <br><br>  But all the same Mary intended to escape.  And she came up with this: <br>  She says somehow Bulrathi: <br>  ‚ÄúLet me go into the possession of the Empire, I‚Äôm dropping mekle-cakes rosy from my orbit to my grandmother and grandfather, they love them as they remember the First War ...‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù says the Bulrati, you will get lost in the Black Galaxy, get lost!  Come on, I'll deliver them myself! <br><br>  And Mary is what we need! <br>  She says: <br>  - Here look!  I packed the presents, and you deliver them to her in a vacuum container so that they fly so they don‚Äôt multiply.  Yes, look - I‚Äôll put a zero-beacon, climb on it, and I‚Äôll follow, do you really want to eat mecake cakes! <br>  ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù says Bulrathi, ‚Äúgive me your container, but as long as I go, I‚Äôll check if there is a meteor shower.‚Äù <br><br>  Only he jerked off, Mary herself climbed into the suit of the highest protection, elegant, pink and hid in a vacuum container, surrounded by nimble and nimble meekl-keykami! <br>  Bulrati returned, sees the container is ready.  Docked him in the cargo bay and went out into outer space at maximum speed, characteristic of his reckless race. <br><br>  It flies among the stars, pierces galaxies, adds speed past suns, and vice versa for planets.  I'm tired.  Yes, and growls under a long black nose: <br>  - Sit on the planet, eat mekle-keykov, and grandmother and grandfather say that they themselves died of natural causes! <br>  And that the vacuum will come out of the container - so I'll dial it again, there are a lot of it in space. <br><br>  He just aimed his ship at the planet, like Mary, and shout: <br>  ‚ÄúI sit high, I look away!  Do not sit on the planet, do not eat mekl-keykov! " <br>  - Look, really, ponastavila zero-observation cameras - the bulrati marveled and threw uranium into the reactor in order to increase speed. <br>  Three more light years flew by - tired again.  He speaks: <br>  - Sit on the planet, eat mekle-keykov, and grandmother and grandfather say that they themselves died of natural causes! <br>  And that the vacuum will come out of the container - so I'll dial it again, there are a lot of it in space. <br><br>  He just aimed his ship at the planet, like Mary, and shout: <br>  ‚ÄúI sit high, I look away!  Do not sit on the planet, do not eat mekl-keykov! " <br>  - Look, really, ponastavila zero-observation cameras - the bulrati marveled and threw uranium into the reactor in order to increase speed. <br><br>  But imperial possessions appeared.  And because of the high speed, the camouflage armor burned down at the ship!  The ship was recognized by the imperial guard platforms on the outskirts of the Galaxy and released gamma terminators and plasma torpedoes.  The bulrati was frightened, detached the container and turned on the reverse rocket move. <br><br>  And there Mary had already been picked up by the Empire's rescue cruiser and delivered, as she was, right in the full protection suit, pink and well-dressed to her grandmother and grandfather!  What a joy it was!  And she already extended an Tan in an hour. <br><br>  Children!  Let this instructive story teach you to visit our offices on time, and your parents not to save on security! <br>  * The text is posted as advertisements ATAN. <br><br>  Author - Artem Karetnikov AKA Leider </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368327/</a></p>
