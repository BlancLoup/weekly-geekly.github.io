Marketing, finance, economics, logistics, risk management, analytics, PR and other aspects of strategic and tactical business management intensively use knowledge and data for setting and implementing goals, for working out, making and executing decisions. <br>  The performance of managers and specialists, and therefore the business as a whole, depends directly on the <i>tools</i> they <i>use</i> . <br><br>  Consider such an important group as <b>information management tools</b> - what it is, why they are needed and why it is so important to pay attention to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e2/3e8/f10/3e23e8f10ebe45e2b75d195da9c32548.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  What is an information management tool? </h1><br><blockquote>  <b>A tool is an object, device, mechanism, machine, or algorithm used to influence an object: its changes or measurements in order to achieve a beneficial effect [Great Soviet Encyclopedia].</b> </blockquote><br>  The most important in the management of business acquired heterogeneous information.  It has become so much that it is impossible to do without some special devices, programs, algorithms and methods for its collection, processing, analysis, storage and distribution.  Such tools, the task of which is to achieve a useful effect when ‚Äúinfluencing‚Äù information necessary for business management, can be grouped into a separate group of ‚Äúinformation management tools‚Äù (hereinafter - <i>tools</i> ).  Moreover, in this case, the term ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù should be understood in a broad sense: starting with the management accounting (data collection) and studying the external market environment - ending with monitoring the implementation of decisions made and making changes to the business process model.

      <br>
      <i>Tools</i> for professionals involved in the process of managing a project or a company that primarily deal with a variety of data and information flows can be viewed from two perspectives. <br><br>  <b>Firstly</b> , the <i>tool</i> is a certain method of working with information that is necessary or accompanying business management procedures.  Depending on the importance and complexity of such procedures, depending on the quality and quantity of such information, the necessary methods of criteria-based selection of sources, collection, filtering, storage, processing, formatting, structuring, classification, complex analysis, visualization and dissemination of information are developed and applied.  Formalized methods of influencing information in the framework of the specific work performed by a specialist are lined up in a certain technology for performing tasks related to obtaining and using management information.  Usually, a <i>tool's</i> technique is expressed through rules, technologies, instructions, practices, models, formulas, experience, or similar things. <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> , the increase in the amount of information that is important and demanded by the business for successful development, makes it necessary to implement the most valuable and time-consuming methods in the form of programs for computer technology.  Moreover, such programs are constantly expanding both in quantity and in functionality.  Special productive programs greatly facilitate the work of a number of specialists.  And it is not by chance that for some of them you have to pay substantial money. <br><br>  The real embodiment of the <i>tool</i> is, overwhelmingly, a software product.  But, while focusing on the ‚Äúcode‚Äù, the very methodological basis that is laid in it is forgotten.  Moreover, not every <i>tool</i> implemented in the form of a program offered on the market, quite clearly shows and formalizes the methodology that is used in it.  It is not correct.  The specialist must know and understand what <i>tool</i> he gets when purchasing a software product in order to be able to use it correctly and not try to solve those tasks that are simply impossible to solve with its help. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Tools and automation of business processes</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The concept of a <i>tool</i> largely echoes the automation of business processes.  In both cases we are talking about the automated execution of certain functions by the employee.  However, when we talk about providing a specialist with an information tool, we start from a slightly different point of view on the same problem.  Unlike process automation, the concept of a tool provides for some discreteness and orientation to a particular specialist.  <i>The tool</i> implies greater flexibility in use and greater competence of the specialist who uses it, including within the framework of a common automated system.  Automation of business processes is in a certain way the formation of a complete and interrelated set of information management tools and not only them for all employees and facilities involved in automated processes.  As a rule, "gaps" in automation are more or less closed by separate <i>tools</i> . <br>  By the way, many of the problems associated with specific tools are also characteristic of automated control systems, only on a different scale. <br></div></div><br><br><h1>  Why do you need an information management tool? </h1><br>  Today the market is replete with a variety of attractive and aggressive offers of <i>tools</i> that provide and organize the work of both individual specialists and the team as a whole.  But if it were all so easy, as advertising campaigns tell us, there probably wouldn't be such a number of marketers and managers involved in ‚Äúselling‚Äù similar products. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Many of the magic tools offered to the business do not truly solve the existing problems in the field of management.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  the introduction of planners and time managers - does not allow you to learn how to plan your time effectively; </li><li>  the introduction of collaboration tools - does not teach professionals to work together on a complex project; </li><li>  implementation of a project management program - does not teach a project manager to plan and control a project, its resources, work structure, schedule; </li><li>  the introduction of cloud technologies - can not teach to think about data security and information risks, as well as the cost-effectiveness of building an IT infrastructure; </li><li>  the introduction of mobile gadgets and Internet things - does not add to the effectiveness and creativity and does not even increase the IQ of the business team; </li><li>  Introduction of a corporate social network - does not improve communication within the company and does not contribute to the respectful attitude of management towards employees ... </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  Then why spend financial resources on the purchase of an unnecessary program, why spend valuable time on its introduction to business practice, why form a tense situation in a team if the basic problems cannot be solved. <br>  Is it because these problems arise that behind any program there is a certain methodology (regulations, knowledge, technology)?  Any program is just a practical, productive implementation of an <i>information management tool</i> .  So, for the effective use of such a software product, it is necessary not only to acquire (develop) and implement it, but also to train specialists to work with it.  And the more complex the <i>tool</i> , the more time and cost it will take to train or even search for professionals who not only will be ‚Äúin the pipeline‚Äù perform automated accounting and reporting procedures, but will be able to extract useful knowledge and experience for business, will be able to prepare and accept balanced and adequate decisions.  To master some of the <i>tools</i> generally require a special long preparation. <br><br>  Without <i>tools,</i> modern business can not do.  How not to do without the collection, processing and analysis of heterogeneous information, in size increasingly tending to the "big data".  Therefore, we have to look for, acquire or develop and transfer to the business staff a variety of <i>tools</i> for working with information to use in order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of their regular and project functions. <br>  Information management tools are needed to reduce costs and increase productivity, to eliminate errors and simplify procedures, to competently work with specialized data and streamline the accumulated knowledge and competencies of the business. <br><br><h1>  Do you know the most versatile information management tool? </h1><br>  Every office worker, as well as every user of a personal computer, knows the most universal <i>tool</i> .  It allows you to solve absolutely any problem of information processing and its presentation.  At the same time, the structure of the processed information is practically unimportant and it is permissible to use any method for influencing information.  In one embodiment or another, such a universal tool is on every computer and actively penetrates every mobile device. <br>  It can be called a streamlined - ‚Äúoffice‚Äù software package, and you can specify the names of specific applications from such a package (I do not want to give preference to any of them and indicate the names of brands). <br>  In general, it is functional: the editor of documents and spreadsheets. <br>  With the help of the document editor, the user can do anything with textual and partially with graphical information, and with the help of spreadsheets you can completely freely manage with digital data (and with formatted text too). <br>  Strictly speaking, office suite programs are so universal that they are used everywhere and not only for the purposes of business management.  Therefore, the commonly used universal information tools have found the widest application.  But you must admit that they occupied a special place in the business processes of the overwhelming number of small, medium and large companies. <br>  <i>In which program can you quickly make an order, a report, and a memorandum in any format?</i>  <i>- In the document editor.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And which program can quickly make a new data table and calculate totals or averages?</i>  <i>- In spreadsheets.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Of course there are more advanced options for individual professionals: desktop databases, schematic and diagram editors, vector editors, template editors, layout programs ... <br>  On the one hand, a universal tool is convenient: for different purposes a single product.  But the more specific and complex business management tasks become, the more complex and productive tools are required. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Take, for example, a hammer ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Take, for an analogy at least, the most versatile tool - a hammer and compare it with a fairly specialized construction stapler.  Both the first and second can be scored.  The first is anything with varying success.  And the second one can only hammer in special brackets, but always with the same result and given strength. <br></div></div><br>  Therefore, no matter how much the manager likes the minimal cost of an office suite, sooner or later you have to think about additional specialized <i>tools</i> .  Traditionally, the first is the accounting system.  It is sometimes the reason for solving the issue of integrated automation of a certain range of business processes. <br><br><h1>  How does a manager make a decision? </h1><br>  Important is the decision-making procedure for the acquisition of a <i>tool</i> that provides automation of a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness processes. <br>  A well-considered and weighted approach is characteristic when choosing complex systems, which includes a formed package of <i>tools</i> - a complete set of everything necessary, so to speak.  They are expensive and allow you to solve management problems at a high level.  For their implementation, it is necessary to rebuild business processes, update the IT infrastructure, train staff, and involve external consultants to solve complex issues. <br>  Another thing is simple, important, but specific software products.  It seems that for their purchase and implementation it is enough to select a product by several simple criteria, pay for it, install it on workstations and instruct specialists to ‚Äúapply in work‚Äù.  Not infrequently, decisions about the purchase of such systems are made in a hurry at active marketing events (exhibitions, conferences). <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Friendly sales managers cheerfully describe to the manager the advantages of their system and encourage them to adopt it.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Increasingly, such software services have network access, subscriber payment for each user, a simplified interface and simple logic with a minimum of personalization and customization of execution algorithms.  And as a rule, the sale focuses on the ease of payment, use, installation and other little things that are important but not essential.  And now the decision maker has drawn a favorable picture: ‚Äúyou install our program on so many computers and literally just in such a quick motion enter tasks for execution, send them to subordinates, they receive and begin to execute, and you are again controlled by the whole process and all you see, what they do - so it will be you carefree time sitting in a comfortable chair with a cup of coffee. "  Moreover, from the same stories of a sales agent it turns out that it will cost you some kind of only N-Adts coins per month for 1 user. <br></div></div><br>  How it ends is known to many of those who were forced to use an inconvenient, weakly customizable, containing many "bugs" system that solves problems of a narrow focus. <br>  Much can depend on how competently a manager makes a decision on the use of an information management tool.  Incorrect behavior can not only make employees nervous, but also partially destroy established formal or informal business processes.  Certain preparation is necessary not only when introducing complex automated systems, but also when introducing specialized discrete software products. <br><br><h1>  Do you need preparatory work? </h1><br>  The introduction of a ‚Äútiny‚Äù software <i>tool that</i> facilitates the work of a specialist involved in the business management circuit may require the same or maybe more work as the introduction of a large automated enterprise level system. <br>  Imposing a <i>tool</i> is a separate issue.  Even if the manager or IT specialist responsible for purchasing software products really liked a product or an Internet service.  But after all, he should understand that, most likely, the business already in one degree or another implements the processes that correspond to the logic of such a product (service).  Employees are already using some <i>tools</i> and have formed certain habits and traditions, methodology and skills for solving sought-after tasks.  One should not think that nothing is being done, and the experts are sullenly sitting without ‚Äúuseful and convenient‚Äù programs.  If the worker performs some work independently and is not given the necessary tool, then he either does nothing (which is unlikely because he would be fired immediately), or he will use techniques and devices known only to him.  Without knowing anything about how a specialist performs his tasks, it is impossible to offer him an adequate and convenient <i>tool</i> for him.  Unless just by chance.  Therefore, many are very skeptical when new programs and rules for working in a computer network are placed on top of them. <br>  Before buying an <i>instrument</i> on the side, you should carefully ask what is happening in a real business, and not in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a business.  Perhaps workers are already using some <i>tools</i> , and they are perhaps even better than those they want to offer them. <br><br>  Therefore, preparation for the use of a new <i>tool</i> begins long before its purchase and it begins with the formulation of requirements for a software product, that is, with the study of business processes and the business objects involved in them.  And when it is completely clear that the existing execution of processes is not convenient for the result or efficiency of business management and is inconvenient for executors, then there is a reason to consider several alternative software products, not forgetting that each such product implements a specific methodology and specific rules. <br><br><h1>  Is it warm under a ‚Äúpatch of quilt‚Äù? </h1><br>  The problem associated with the introduction of new process automation systems is not new.  This applies to the entire spectrum of automated systems: from accounting, to technological and production. <br>  However, such ‚Äúspecial level of fragmentation‚Äù products, mostly programmed using cloud technologies, web services, browser interfaces and similar ‚Äúremote‚Äù technologies, are becoming more and more intrusive.    ,   ¬´ ¬ª     ,    ,    ,    ,     - .   ¬´    30- ¬ª          . <br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title">         </b> <div class="spoiler_text">       ,          .   ,       ,    .   ,   ,   ,     .                 ( )    . <br></div></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, such fragmentation presents </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tools that</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> solve extremely narrow questions and problems, concentrating on well-known traditional and typical business process schemes. Having collected several </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tools</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> you can get quite a colorful "patchwork". </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Patchwork automation is a separate big topic with its compatibility issues and conflicts in both practical and theoretical terms. But one thing is when a company independently develops a single integrated system according to the same rules. And another thing is when a company acquires various </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tools</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in terms of format and functionality </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, which, moreover, may contradict each other in their methodological basis. Monitor </font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tool</font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> compatibility</font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Different suppliers are too expensive and difficult. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if they all work on the basis of generally accepted standards. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not get involved in new </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tools</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , if they are not very well embedded in an existing system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And to understand whether the </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tool is</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> new, how effective it is and how it fits into the existing configuration of business processes and existing IT infrastructure, you need to go back to the previous question and make sure once again that preparatory work is extremely important when acquiring any, even simple and cheap , information management tool.</font></font><br><br><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Who are the stars? </font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The choice of the tool should involve both subject specialists who will use it and IT specialists who will accompany it. The decision word must depend on real arguments based on the evaluation of the characteristics of the information management tool. But it may turn out that one characteristic will make it absolutely impossible for a </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tool to</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> be used by </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">business. For example, elementary incompatibility with the base operating system or contradiction of existing business processes. But it may turn out that a decision will be made to refine the IT infrastructure and business processes, because the company will decide that the </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tool</font></font></i>  ,   . , ,   ,       -   <i></i> . <br>    ,     <i></i>   -             . , . <br><br> <b> </b> : <br> ‚Äî            ; <br> ‚Äî    ,        ; <br> ‚Äî       ; <br> ‚Äî       -      ; <br> ‚Äî  ; <br> ‚Äî     ; <br> ‚Äî         ; <br> ‚Äî      ; <br> ‚Äî       . <br><br> <b>-</b> : <br> ‚Äî  -         ; <br> ‚Äî  ,      ; <br> ‚Äî     -; <br> ‚Äî      ; <br> ‚Äî   ,   ,   ; <br> ‚Äî   ; <br> ‚Äî         ,    (   ); <br> ‚Äî    ; <br> ‚Äî        -; <br> ‚Äî           . <br><br>   <b></b> : <br> ‚Äî      ,  ,      , <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - as well as making final decisions on each of the issues of the life cycle of information management tools. </font></font><br><br><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> A new specialist with an old tool or a new tool with an old specialist? </font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Interestingly, the relevance when considering the issue of information management tools is an understanding of the problems of personnel management. </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The tools</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> themselves are not able to do anything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They are used by experts and much or even everything depends on how they are used. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this regard, there are several observations:</font></font><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the employee must be able to work with the tool, i.e. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">he must understand what this tool is for, what limitations and peculiarities it has, what it allows to do within the framework of certain actions (application technology), and what it does not allow;</font></font></li><li>                    ; </li><li>     (, , )         ; </li><li>            ,              ; </li><li>       (        ),    ,     ; </li><li>             ; </li><li>        ,           ; </li><li>      ,        . </li></ul><br>        , ,      .  ,               <i></i> .              .    <i></i> ,          .                .     <i></i>  <i></i>   ,      .  ,  ,               ,         <i></i> . <br><br><h1>  And what is the conclusion? </h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Information technologies for economics and business management are important and effective with the condition that they are competently and responsibly used. Effective "IT-things" are expensive and not so much in acquisition, as in mastering and in possession. A business can easily buy a software licensed product, but with the same ease will arise difficult questions of professional application, mastering and applying the knowledge accompanying the product, working out the experience of everyday use of the product without errors and emergencies, improving the product to its competitive advantages. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sadly, but in the process of mastering the </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tool</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, a licensed program or information technology, a significant role should be played by top and mid-level business managers, as well as profile specialists. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Information technology should be as interested as possible and targeted business structures. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To shift all the responsibilities and all the responsibility for the selection of information management tools and their effective use to the information technology service specialists is incorrect. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The tool</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that business is going to use to implement specific business processes should:</font></font><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> implement an acceptable and relevant methodology; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> formalize targeted business processes clearly and clearly; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> fit into the general model of business processes and business objects of the company; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> be combined with other available tools; </font></font></li><li>   ,    ; </li><li>        ; </li><li>       ; </li><li>         IT-; </li><li>    ; </li><li>   -         ,       . </li></ol><br> <i> ,       ‚Äî    ,      - (, ).     ,           ¬´¬ª     ,  .
