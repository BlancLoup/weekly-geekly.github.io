The realization of this sad fact came later, when I was already leaving the subway.  The new Nexus 4 is a pity to lose.  Fortunately, I knew about several programs that can track the location of the phone. <br><br>  When I came home, I first tried to turn on Prey, but then I remembered that after rutting the phone, I forgot to activate my account. <br>  After that, I tried to put Plan B, but here I was waiting for a bummer.  Plan B only works on older versions of the OS. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Almost resigned to the loss of the phone, I stumbled upon the Android Device Manager ( <a href="http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager">www.google.com/android/devicemanager</a> ).  This is a new thing that can track your phone and does not require third-party programs.  (Probably only works with 4.2, I did not check below). <br><br>  The phone was found at the bus depot.  What the hell is not joking, I thought, and went there.  But to find the phone when in the depot hundreds of buses is very difficult.  At least no one took it and he will most likely end up in the lost and found office :) <br><br>  The whole weekend the phone was in the depot, and I started to think that it was some kind of glitch, because  I took it off the charger on Friday morning. <br><br>  Today, before leaving for work, I found it not at the depot, but at a major bus stop.  When I came to work, the phone was already in the university area, across the city.  No one found him, and he continues to ride the bus.  At least now the task is simplified. <br><br>  Knowing the final and initial stop, I determined the route number.  ‚Ññ49 - Metrotown - UBC. <br>  After the morning meeting, after tracking the phone a few more times this theory was aborted. <br>  Using a mobile site that shows buses on a map in real time ( <a href="http://nb.translink.ca/Map/Route/049/Trip/EB1">nb.translink.ca/Map/Route/049/Trip/EB1</a> ) I was able to calculate the number of the bus itself. <br><br>  After that, there was nothing left :) I called the lost property office of Translink, and told them in detail in which particular bus I needed to look for my phone number and the seat on which it was planted. <br><br>  The operator was greatly surprised by the accuracy of my data, and the bus was just approaching the final one. <br><br>  Five minutes later they called me back and said that the phone was found!  Victory. <br><br>  The only thing I cannot understand is the time of work (from the morning of Friday, until Monday morning).  Even using CyanogenMod is a dofig, considering that I hammered it on the GPS every 5 minutes for a couple of days :) True, it has an inductive Qi charger, maybe it lay next to some electric cable ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189866/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189866/</a></p>
