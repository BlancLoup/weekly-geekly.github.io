      Do you know this script?  If yes, then you are not alone. <br><br>  Thoughts on problems and fears can negate any motivation and force to abandon your dream, even without embodying its realization. <br><br>  But what if all your arguments are just excuses that have nothing to do with reality? <br><br>  We all restrain ourselves, hiding behind pretexts.  And I am not an exception. <br><br>  In my youth I wanted to go abroad.  But each time, thinking about it, I ran across a whole list of reasons explaining why the plan was impracticable. <br><br>  How will I travel?  Would it be too expensive?  Is there any danger? <br><br>  A year passed before I overcame an obstacle.  I dropped all the excuses and bought a plane ticket to Southeast Asia. <br><br>  Having done so, I could understand that all this time I was held back only by prepositions.  I finally realized that there were no real obstacles, they <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/pyat-zabluzhdeniy-o-produktivnosti-kotorye-my-sebe-vnushaem/">were only in my head</a> . <br><br>  The truth is that every great dream can be broken and ignored because of one or two excuses.  The key lies in noticing their appearance and not allowing you to interfere with living the life you are dreaming about. <br><br>  Here are some common excuses separating from the dream. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. No time</font> </h2><br>  In the day just 24 hours.  And this will never change.  Therefore, if this time you have filled with many cases, this obstacle may seem insurmountable. <br><br>  But sometimes the search for time is associated with changing priorities.  Is there any activity that you are ready to give up?  Do you have responsibilities that someone else might as well do? <br><br>  You need to ask yourself questions of this kind. <br><br>  Finding time to make your dreams come true.  If something really matters, you have to spend time on it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. I am too afraid</font> </h2><br>  There may be various types of fears.  Maybe you are afraid of mistakes, failure, your own irrelevance, or you are just tormented by the fear of the unknown.  Any of these horror stories can appear suddenly and ruin your path to a dream. <br><br>  It is important to <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/formula-provala-kak-perestat-sabotirovat-sebya/">recognize fear and deal with it</a> as soon as it arises.  Thrill before serious decisions - this is natural. <br>  But remember that most fears are emotional, not logical. <br><br>  Before I went on a trip, many said they were afraid of attacks or terrorist attacks. <br>  But the greatest real danger on the road is a car accident.  It hurts or kills more travelers than anything else.  There is also the fear of traveling, but people never mention it. <br><br>  Ask yourself if there is something real behind your feeling.  Maybe it's not as bad as you think. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. I have little money</font> </h2><br>  When it comes to financing a dream, this argument can be very real.  But look at him better before giving up on his dream because of him. <br><br>  Often there are cheap solutions that you probably never even thought about before.  Calculate how much money you really need.  Record all expenses. <br><br>  And remember: even if the problem is money, it does not mean that it is insurmountable.  Often there are ways to postpone the implementation of the dream at least a little.  If there is a desire, there will be a skill. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. For me it is impossible</font> </h2><br>  Sometimes a dream may seem unreal.  You can face great goals with huge obstacles that look inaccessible. <br><br>  The problem is that people often confuse impossibility with ordinary difficulty.  What you want to do may seem so complicated that you lose confidence in your own abilities. <br><br>  It's not impossible.  The fact is that - in your opinion - you are not able to cope with it. <br><br>  It is easier to overcome this obstacle by finding a different point of view.  Focus on why you can do it, and not on the opposite.  This will lead you away from the ‚Äúattitude of impossibility‚Äù to something more constructive. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Now is not the right time to start.</font> </h2><br>  The unfortunate truth of life is this: there is no perfect time for something.  There are always conditions, personal situations or environmental factors pushing to abandon the performance of dreams. <br><br>  Of course, this does not mean that you should not take anything at all. <br>  There are a huge number of examples telling <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uroki-uspekha-i-produmannykh-resheniy/">about people who have achieved lofty goals</a> in terrible circumstances.  Say, the owners of such large companies now as HP and Revlon began to work in the 30s of the XX century, when America was in a terrible economic crisis. <br><br>  If you wait until the conditions are perfect, then you will wait forever.  Before you understand this, a year will pass, and you will not make a single step to the realization of your plans. <br><br>  While you are waiting for the right moment, time is running out. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/3-dorogi-skvoz-ad/">3 roads through hell</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300264/</a></p>
