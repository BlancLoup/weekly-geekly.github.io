Today we will share with you tips with which you can save your money in a bank account and ... buy everything you need. <br><br>  These tips will help you shop at online stores in the USA and Europe with maximum savings, and <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3Dblog_article_bro%26utm_campaign%3Dautumn16">Banderolka</a> will provide quick and economical delivery! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Look for discount codes (even if you have to install a <a href="http://find.qwintry.com/ru/posts/skidki-ot-banderolki%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3Dblog_article_bro%26utm_campaign%3Dautumn16">special browser extension</a> )</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/daf/67b/052/daf67b052699493daa1f554d7e79f334.png"><br><br>  In our case, discount codes are a synonym for savings.  They apply to any purchases, even from the ‚Äúsale‚Äù category.  These hit codes must be entered at the ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù stage when you select a payment method.  Be careful: they usually make the discount code entry field somehow dull, apparently in the hope that the buyer simply won't see it.

Some stores send discount codes by email (another reason not to unsubscribe from kilograms of this daily spam).  But it is more convenient to use special services like <a href="http://www.mrrebates.com/%3Frefid%3D441983">Mr.Rebates</a> , which publish a bunch of offers from various online stores.  Coupon sites (Groupon, Gilt City) will also be useful, sometimes you can also find the coveted code there. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Buy at sales, in outlets and hypermarkets</font> </h2><br>  In Europe and especially in the USA, discounts have long been the engine of sales.  In any online store, look in the section Sale or Clearance.  Figures, percentages and assortment in them change very often: in August you can find great things for winter at super-prices. <br><br>  A known trick of a smart buyer is to order products from the biggest ones.  On <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ref%3Das_li_ss_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26linkCode%3Dsl2%26tag%3Dqw0f-20%26linkId%3D6d0e469233d6f09688e5d90b5197aff7">Amazon</a> , <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/">B &amp; H</a> or <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay,</a> manufacturers set prices lower than in their official stores.  Hypermarkets are often pleased with quick sales, which last only a day, or ‚Äúdeals of the day‚Äù (a limited range of products is offered with great discounts).  To get LG's flagship smartphone at a price $ 100 lower than a regular or ultra-thin Dell laptop at half price is quite a solvable task, if you set such a goal and <a href="https://vk.com/banderolkanews">‚Äúbe friends‚Äù with the Banderolka</a> . <br><br>  We constantly monitor sales-sections of the largest stores and share valuable information on our pages on social networks.  Subscribe to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Banderolkanews/">Facebook</a> , <a href="http://instagram.com/banderolka/">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://vk.com/banderolkanews">VKontakte</a> to be aware of the most popular offers. <br><br>  Our <a href="https://vk.com/banderolkanews">support</a> team can always recommend stores with the best prices for the thing you are looking for.  Many brands have American online outlets (about which not everyone knows about) - with the remnants of past collections and excellent discounts.  For example, the retro version of the classic New Balance 574 in the <a href="https://www.joesnewbalanceoutlet.com/">brand's outlet is</a> worth less than $ 50.  It is unlikely to find cheaper! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1b/44b/b4b/d1b44bb4b3a74888beb1cff0f9b272bf.gif" alt="image" width="600"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Subscribe to all newsletters (and then unsubscribe!)</font> </h2><br>  Stores often offer a one-time discount to new customers in exchange for receiving promotional mailings.  You are entering the site for the first time - and a window with a tempting offer jumps out onto the screen.  If this does not happen, it is worth scrolling the page to the end or look in the corner.  In most cases, the form in which you need to enter your email address is necessarily present on the site and promises to give from 5% to 10% discount on the order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/275/49f/7a0/27549f7a0d5540729ba6409c66c9d6d5.png"><br><br><blockquote>  Here the only problem is that now you will almost receive daily letters from stores.  Therefore, taking advantage of the discount, with a calm heart, unsubscribe from the newsletter. <br></blockquote><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Become a member of the club</font> </h2><br>  Recently, a class of <a href="http://ruelala.com/">online stores</a> that sell only ‚Äúclosed‚Äù sales.  Access to them can be obtained in exchange for e-mail.  But this is a fair deal: only the information you want to receive will be sent to the mail.  They sell such shops all in a row, with huge discounts and very quickly.  True, these are mainly premium quality products and luxury brands. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Look for stores with better returns policy (fool the system)</font> </h2><br>  Many online stores offer free shipping, provided you spend a certain amount of money.  But stores that are ready for free returns are much smaller.  And yet they are the find for online shopping professionals like you and me!  The secret is simple: you <b>order exactly as many things as you can for free shipping, and then return everything you don't need</b> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad9/b89/879/ad9b898791e6484a9145b306369e598a.gif" alt="image" width="600"></div><br>  Such a thing can be turned in these stores with ideal delivery and return conditions (ie free): <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">ThinkGeek</a> , <a href="http://zappos.com/">Zappos</a> , <a href="http://us.topshop.com/%3Fgeoip%3Dhome">Topshop</a> , <a href="https://www.net-a-porter.com/">Net-a-Porter</a> , <a href="https://www.shopbop.com/">Shopbop</a> , <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/">Nike</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Better yet: do not return purchases, but money for them!</font> </h2> <a href="http://www.mrrebates.com/%3Frefid%3D441983"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78e/3a4/96d/78e3a496d50f47ef8d3856cda3bd6724.png"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.mrrebates.com/%3Frefid%3D441983">Mr.Rebates</a> is a service with which you can return from 1% to 20% of the value of goods purchased by you in 2,000 American stores.
