  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tripartite kingdoms delivered to reality: how I went to IgroMir 2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In early October, the combined freak-geek-exhibitions <b>Igromir 2015</b> and <b>Comic Con Russia 2015</b> died down.  I am sure many of Habr's and GT readers have not spared this event, but you always want to relive the pleasant moments again.  And those who could not get to Crocus near Moscow, should be, at least, curious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e3/ba3/9cb/0e3ba39cb843432faad6bc403a9cb570.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Impressions will be enough until next year, and everything will not work out.  In an attempt to grasp everything, I rushed, as I could, from the stand to the stand.  And now I understand why visitors take a queue at the entrance from 8 am.  I warn you, one day is not enough for everything.  Either you need to take a ticket for all days, or plan in advance what you want to test.  To enter - you need to defend a deranged queue.  However, the organization is worthy, there was no crush due to the separation of inputs and streams.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b05/b23/185/b05b2318574b464781cab49af069ded9.jpg"><br><br>  Even before the entrance one could admire an armored vehicle from the Armata project and even win it, and after all, someone would get it!  Mail.ru decided to tear the templates to shreds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/785/0c2/987/7850c29870664724a75bd54841282e3f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Tip: to get access to at least something - morally prepare, you will need to stand.  For example, behind the autograph of the sex symbol geek culture seductive robot-sixon the sixth model of the ‚ÄúStar Cruiser Galaxy‚Äù and the prototype characters of games from Electronic Arts, Blizzard Entertainment and BioWare - Trisha Helfer.  By the way, access to the body of Trisha and her painting had to be paid in advance.  Mere mortals could just watch from afar on the Comic Con scene. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af3/bd4/a7d/af3bd4a7db124ed580ca237750d25998.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Against her background, Anthony Daniels, the very eternal singer of the C-3PO droid from all Star Wars, did not look as epic as he could have.  Especially in light of the opposition rally. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ba/0bc/729/8ba0bc729ddb4c49a74ffa3587d61c4e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They say that Alfie Allen, who plays the role of Theon Greyjoy (aka Stinker) in the Game of Thrones, also appeared, but could not be found in the crowd.  Those who did not get an autograph could console themselves with the purchase of magical artifacts, a whole themed mall located in one of the halls of IgroMir. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/144/657/308/1446573080f841e19dd8ca1f20745bba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I, as a decent man - I will not bypass the beautiful half.  This year, the organizers successfully combined two themes - IgroMir itself and the pop culture festival Comic Con, where cosplay is fully unfolded, mostly with decent makeup and generally good images of the virtual population.  The eye jumped from one warrior to another, and during the break lingered on the queens.  Pleasant feeling that people are burning and want to please.  Yes, I confess, in many respects for this and went.  I share a positive: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1c/bbc/714/f1cbbc714f0b4c42842102160d7f8dd5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bc/0d2/a95/5bc0d2a9536341a88f629f06f7b00eac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/219/7cc/10c/2197cc10c452417e870bce94ce4a26cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63b/e94/1dc/63be941dc06541c49536640e5ca759fc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d2/59f/522/8d259f522e9341b0a278a04a7c6b761d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/852/d09/1d5/852d091d5cac41d19979fb098b2206cc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/847/e1c/e5c/847e1ce5ccbc4035bfdfcdad789ac4c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/231/9bb/8b2/2319bb8b2b0546858b9c3c7750444c99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f1/3ca/788/8f13ca788266495082ac8c6fcd01a47f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Hardly having torn off the spellbound look from the female commanders at Comic Con, it was finally possible to look around - who offers what at the Igromir itself.  Degree of chaos at times higher, it is extremely difficult to navigate.  Expectedly were widely represented game developers.  Large-scale announcement from Sony with the long-awaited release of the year - Star Wars: Battlefront shooter in the version for Playstation 4, which is scheduled for release on November 17.  By appointment, you could also try the Playstation VR virtual reality helmet, which can be purchased only in early 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c03/574/7b3/c035747b3f914e6d95af85a20168e018.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The queues for the demonstration "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" were still less than to the gaming zones on the stand of Wargaming.  He simply stifled the will and fascinated with the scale, the maritime theme in the design hinted at the presentation of the alpha version of the game World of Warships, there was a small split of focus: both tanks and ships.  But standing in line it did not bother.  Everyone wanted to try everything and win something for it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ca/26b/e7c/2ca26be7c9bc4f47809efa311df909d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Touching fan-art detekted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e9/3a7/ab3/4e93a7ab3dbb4721b23c677836d945d4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And professionally designed in a secret man-tank design bureau. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/762/95a/bda/76295abda05542348952ff12b9d30aab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And even such a complex phenomenon as a tank girl. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/177/d32/e43/177d32e43221461b93b1a3bdebb6216c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Manufacturers of iron and accessories did not stay aside from the events, Asus showed several new products: the newest ASUS motherboards based on the Intel Z170 chipset, video cards based on the NVIDIA GTX 9xx Strix and Poseidon series, gaming computers ROG GR6 and G20CB, gaming accessories and monitors.  Intel presented the 6th generation of Intel R Core T processors for gamers.  All this could immediately test in games at maximum quality settings. <br><br>  Not going around and promo-girls, where without them (carefully, there are legs). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcd/4de/aa9/fcd4deaa973f45c7a211f13dc3eda624.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df1/b03/5e1/df1b035e14a74e4ba8144df57a7d9e47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ec/1ad/d17/1ec1add1701a4e0a9c65f188ab2410c9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fe/f67/629/7fef676294234499a9c1ef0a910724c9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And a little more about the prizes.  I want to note separately that prizes were distributed at every corner: for selfies with a hashtag, for participating in contests, for being just beautiful or smart, or you were lucky to pass by at the right moment.  While looking at the fan tank, I got vitamin C and a charming smile from Lady WebMoney. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad9/a22/f96/ad9a22f9690546bc943636502f4fe357.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The result is this: if you do not prepare at least morally, you can get lost at Igromir and hate the crowd.  If you prepare and tune in, except for juicy photos and general enthusiasm, you can carry a full set of headsets with a new laptop into the bargain.  Such people were not small, you only need to give a hand in time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366653/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366653/</a></p>
