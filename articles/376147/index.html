  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review: SLA DLP in Russian. How to respond to foreign monsters?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear amateurs and professionals of 3D printing, in this post I want to talk about the decision in the field of printing by photopolymers, created by Russian specialists in the Russian city called St. Petersburg.  Obtained after growing models can be used for direct pouring, or removal of cold or hot rubber, as well as possible as a ready-made solution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfa/cff/28d/dfacff28d38a43d8a6601e68425b85b6.jpg"><br><br>  It will be a question of a 3D SLA DLP printer called <b>Starlight</b> and its younger Russian DLP model, now rev.7.  This project has existed for more than a year, but it's time to tell more about it.  Over the past period, the main assemblies were refined, the photopolymer was improved (several materials of different composition were developed - about this in a separate article) and field tests were carried out by the first owners. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, what do we have: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9c/f54/290/c9cf5429067144a0980011555805e159.jpg"><br>  The junior model (personal, desktop, - underline the right one) is a DLP 3D printer that prints high-precision objects using SLA technology (stereolithography).  The design of the printer provides a smooth adjustment of the print area of ‚Äã‚Äã96 * 54 * 200 mm.  The positioning system of the printing carriage along the Z axis ensures the accuracy of a layer of 20 microns (the declared data. On a professional model it is possible to achieve 10-12 microns).

      Such characteristics make it possible to grow prototypes of jewelry and dental products with a visually smooth surface. <br>  To date, the economy model has undergone several changes and is already released version 7. <br><br>  <b>What's new</b> <br><br>  - an economical FullHD projector (1920x1080 pixels) with a high resource; <br>  - Variable XY resolution of 45 microns (0.045 mm) and more; <br>  - Z resolution from 20 microns (0,020mm) and more; <br>  - variable working field from 96x54x180mm with the possibility of increasing to 124x70x180 and more (by agreement); <br>  - A new case of composite materials; <br>  - proven on previous models of mechanics, kinematics and electronics; <br>  - printed substrate of new design <br>  - printed baths of a new type; <br>  - simple and functional licensed software; <br>  - delivery option with extended extended warranty. <br><br>  More photos: <a href="">one</a> and <a href="">two</a> . <br><br>  The older (professional, production) model is a high-precision device, during which fine photo-chemical processes take place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d0/4df/d0e/6d04dfd0ea8744168cb2d91916763e63.png"><br><br>  The Starlight 3D printer was designed and created as a model capable of competing with professional SLA models of leading brands.  This is a professional system focused on the jewelry and dental markets.  The enclosure is enclosed, the internal control of the projection system is used, and the integrated postpolymerization chamber is used. <br><br>  A small plate of comparison of fellows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72f/971/caf/72f971caf4184b2fb83c23797e105863.png"><br><br>  Both models have their own software, consisting of two programs. <br><br>  The first: CreationWorkshop for StarLight 3D from the manufacturer of software for 3D printing EnvisionLabs (license). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91b/5be/36d/91b5be36d54c445dafef52cbd4e01dfe.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="">Or so</a> <br><br>  Supported features: <br><br>  - Import file format: STL, OBJ, 3DS, AMF; <br>  - Placement (manual and automatic) of objects on the desktop, rotation, scaling; <br>  - Installation of supports (manual and automatic), calculation of support platforms; <br>  - Automatic calculation of the cost of printing; <br>  - Slicing (cutting) models for subsequent printing. <br><br>  The second program supplied with the printer is the printer's host controller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da2/636/238/da2636238eaf4505a2a8ac234c9b354c.png"><br><br>  This is a small utility that provides the ability to print models cut by third-party software.  The program allows you to set print options and operate on input files of various formats.  The user decides which program to use for the preparation of printing: ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù or third-party software. <br><br>  Software is constantly evolving and complemented by new functionality. <br><br>  A few photos after printing: <a href="">time</a> |  <a href="">two</a> |  <a href="">three</a> |  <a href="">first after third</a> |  <a href="">non jeweler (for judge dredd)</a> <br><br>  Photo models for dental needs, unfortunately, not preserved. <br><br>  At the end of the review I will focus on the advantages and disadvantages of the model. <br><br>  Among the minuses of the models presented, it can be noted that when setting up, ‚Äú0‚Äù must be found manually, lamination on some models is possible - careful calibration is needed, and, well, a huge scope for imagination to work on the exterior and interior. <br><br>  Of the advantages, of course, it is necessary to highlight the cost of equipment in comparison with foreign analogues, high printing accuracy, a composite case, the ability to work with polymers of various manufacturers, service and a warehouse of consumables in the territory of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  And, of course, a bonus for the owner of Russian DLP will be the opportunity to listen to your favorite radio while typing, while Starlight owners will also use a post-polymerization camera to check banknotes. <br><br>  And finally, I propose to study the summary table on SLA printers, kindly provided by the manufacturer of printers RussianDLP and Starlight: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d6/2bd/1e2/0d62bd1e258e4eb5a7a44a5ad84a87ef.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376147/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376147/</a></p>
