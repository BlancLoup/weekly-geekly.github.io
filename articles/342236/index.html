  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origin of accounting objects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  Systems engineering postulates that there are different descriptions of the system architecture.  In this case, the definition of architecture system engineering does not.  Given only the definition of the term "description of the architecture."  I want to understand why this happened. <br><br>  Attempting to figure out what the system architecture was not successful, however, the reasoning that was made allowed me to bridge the gap between my methodology and other methodologies for describing subject areas.  Thanks to everyone who helped me with this!  In this article I will explain how the objects we model appear. <br><br><h4>  The emergence of the term "building architecture" </h4><br>  So, let us have a description of the building in terms of aesthetics and functionality.  This description is called an architectural description.  The architectural description of the building is also called, for short, the architecture of the building.  An outside observer who is far from the construction industry can say: describe the architecture of the building to me.  The builders do not say that, they say: give me the architectural part of the project.  Builders are expressed more accurately, but the outsider may not know.  Architecture in construction is a body of knowledge on building design in terms of functionality and aesthetics.  This body of knowledge does not include the design of nodes, the calculation of loads, etc., than the designers responsible for the design part of the project are busy.  From the point of view of this body of knowledge, a building model is built and is called: the architectural description of the building, or for short, the architecture of the building. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Suppose that we are not builders and took the architectural part of the building project in our hands and called it the building architecture.  Pretty quickly we get used to the idea that the building has architecture.  After some time, we begin to wonder: what is architecture, how does it look, and how to describe it?  From this moment on, in our consciousness, architecture begins an independent existence, and the architectural description becomes a description of architecture.  Tracked down?

      All this would be rather boring and uninteresting if it were not for the observation of how we create objects of accounting in our consciousness. <br><br><h4>  The emergence of objects </h4><br>  Suppose we observe the heating of bodies.  We can come to the conclusion that there is such an analogy: supposedly there is a volatile fraction of a substance, which we call caloric.  The presence of this substance allows us to explain the processes of heating bodies (the flow of caloric, as we now call this process).  We begin to see caloric content everywhere, build different models of its description, teach students.  This continues as long as this reality modeling method continues to be useful.  As soon as it ceases to satisfy our needs, we replace it with another method.  The new method introduces new terms, new entities.  But these terms and entities do not really exist, they are only a way of describing our experience, and we easily give up on them when they cease to satisfy our needs. <br><br>  So, let as a result of our research we come to the need to introduce a new method of describing the real.  Let's call it the caloric description of things.  This description allows us to explain the existence of an imaginary substance - caloric.  There is he really, or not, we do not care, because the answer to this question can not be given.  Gradually, we get used to the fact that the description in the form of caloric works and even begin to think that the caloric exists.  The same applies to anything: Cooper pairs, dark matter, God, and so on.  First, the modeling method, then the real belief in the existence of imaginary objects. <br><br>  But there are such objects for which we have not just a method of description, but also a method of obtaining (isolation from the real).  We consider these objects to be real, unlike those which cannot be compared with the method of obtaining, but only the method of description. <br><br>  So there are stools, tables, computers and other variety of things.  They do not exist without generating them.  We have already forgotten when the method of receiving the stool appeared, and therefore we believe that the stool exists outside of our consciousness. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  If so, then the object architecture of the system will soon appear as an electron or gravitational field appeared.  But for an electron there is a method for its production, but for architecture it is not. <br><br>  Now the question is: does the system have one architecture or many of them?  What method of simulation of the existence will be chosen, will be the answer.  But the definition of architecture, we can not give.  We will only describe it through the modeling method ... <br><br><h4>  How to define? </h4><br><br>  How to define a concept if objects do not exist?  It looks like this: <br><br>  The object (phenomenon and so on) is what can be obtained in the following way (further description of the method of obtaining). <br><br>  A collection of these methods must be kept in a chamber of weights and scales so that the terms do not crawl). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342236/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342236/</a></p>
