  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to simplify roaming electric vehicles?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good evening, dear Habrayuzer! <br>  Today I would like to tell you about the first of its kind project E-Mobility B2B Marketplace, which will facilitate the charging of electric vehicles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e3/729/801/4e372980193e1dda80fbb03206700fbe.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  IBM has introduced a project that will simplify charging of electric vehicles and charging for consumers regardless of their location.  The pilot-demonstration system, called B2B-Marketplace, will provide electricity suppliers, car makers and owners of charging points the opportunity to share and integrate their services on the basis of one common IT platform.  As a result, a single European network of charging stations for electric vehicles will be created. <br><br>  By promoting the distribution of vehicles on electric power, the B2B Marketplace pilot and demonstration system provides drivers with the ability to charge electric cars and pay for charging regardless of their location and energy supplier - an approach similar to international roaming for mobile phones.  The project aims to support the interaction of multiple charging stations and utility utilities united in a single network.  As a result, electric vehicle drivers may not worry that they are too far from a local charging point or station served by their electricity supplier.

This task is fixed in the document of the European Commission European Recovery Plan, which provides for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 60% by 2050. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b7a/14b/65e/b7a14b65eeba3713500c9d45f6fa06ee.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúThis market platform will create the basis for the mass market of electric vehicles in Europe.  It provides free access to charging points throughout Europe, making traveling on an electric car simple and convenient, ‚Äùsaid Dr. Heike Barlag from Siemens AG, coordinator of the Green eMotion program. <br><br>  The project, which is based on IBM software and the IBM SmartCloud Enterprise cloud platform, creates a scalable, open standards-based environment that allows manufacturers and suppliers to align their services with consumer and industry requirements.  Using analytic software, Green eMotion program members will also be able to gain valuable knowledge to develop new or improved services to expand the number of electric vehicles as the market grows.  Partners of Green eMotion, in particular Enel, SAP and Siemens, have already developed the required services for electric vehicles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ab/ffc/0b8/3abffc0b84d37d206e56bc6b50667e72.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúMany of the innovative initiatives of Green eMotion have the potential to restructure and improve the complex European transport system and energy infrastructure.  Other countries have been given a good example to follow, ‚Äùsaid Clay Luthy, head of Global Distributed Energy Resource at IBM.  ‚ÄúOur goal within the Green eMotion program is to help reach a new level of technological excellence of electric vehicle infrastructure and a new level of convenience for drivers.  We hope that this demonstration project will accelerate innovation and transformation, and expand their geographic scope. ‚Äù <br><br>  IBM is one of 43 organizations in Europe participating in the Green eMotion project, including: energy service providers, electric vehicle manufacturers, city administrations, and research institutes working together on European ‚Äúelectromobilization‚Äù.  In a recently introduced project with <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/38490.wss">ESB Networks</a> , IBM also helps to improve the reliability of the electricity grid, contributes to the spread of the use of electric vehicles, as well as solving problems of monetary and financial calculations - by combining cloud and analytical capabilities. <br><br>  The E-Mobility B2B Marketplace project is launched in different regions of Europe.
