And so, without keeping up with the tradition of the annual cycle of updating their devices, XIAOMI announced Redmi Pro last week. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, this company is able to do smartphones - something that only <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_268449.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Redmi Note 2</a> costs, which has become a real bestseller in just a few months and was selling like hotcakes.  With naming, XIAOMI is still more interesting: initially it was expected that Redmi Note 3 would be called Redmi Note 2 Pro, but the manufacturer nevertheless decided to allocate the smartphone to a new generation of devices of the Redmi Note line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ea/38e/396/9ea38e39646fce7ab3e2b908788ceb12.jpg">

      But with the fourth generation, the company acted differently and added the cherished prefix Pro, although Redmi Note 3 is also known to some as <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_308843.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Redmi Note 3 Pro</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a84/10c/d6a/a8410cd6a0657d6d6f274ecfce158de9.jpg"><br><br>  There were many leaks, even more rumors, and in general, most of them were confirmed.  Together with <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/279018/">the ultrabook line of Mi Notebook Air, the</a> XIAOMI presented its most powerful smartphone, which can easily give pepper to many flagships from other manufacturers.  First of all, it is worth noting the screen: 5.5 inches, made by OLED technology, Full HD resolution with 401 ppi.  By the way, Redmi Pro is the first XIAOMI smartphone, in which the company decided to use OLED.  The display provides a 100% coverage of the NTSC color range, the colors are really bright and saturated.  All this is covered with 2.5D glass with rounded edges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce4/ea5/699/ce4ea5699ffcfad6d5b05ea204f0eda0.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab7/ffb/016/ab7ffb01658a1dbf39b60e69199bdf16.jpg"><br><br>  With a battery capacity of 4050 mAh (as in the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_367773.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Redmi 3S</a> ), engineers from the Chinese manufacturer managed to minimize the dimensions of the new product - as a result, we have 151.5 x 76.8 x 8.15 mm and weighs 174 g. XIAOMI remains in trend and refuses micro USB favoring USB Type-C, but leaves a 3.5 mm audio output (the same Apple is rumored to abandon the iPhone 7).  The possibility of fast charging is another plus in the manufacturer‚Äôs piggy bank. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/484/28b/36b/48428b36bc59c6024eb3ced5bbf9c791.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/564/a4c/ce8/564a4cce821fca04245c1d274791d432.jpg"><br><br>  Technical characteristics of the device correspond to the modern flagship.  There are three options to choose from: simpler (3 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal memory and Helio X20 chipset), more powerful (3 GB of RAM, 64 GB of internal memory, but already Helio X25) and the ‚Äúmarathon‚Äù version - the same Helio X25, but 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal memory.  Yes, Helio X10 (aka MT6795) in XIAOMI decided to give up after Redmi Note 3 in favor of the ten-core chipset, and even in the younger version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/102/cbb/b4e/102cbbb4e9f8386403b204a19858ed71.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3df/543/5cc/3df5435ccfd8b2e35d41a51b91e2556f.png"><br><br>  Redmi Pro cameras deserve special attention.  The rear camera is double - 13 megapixels (Sony IMX258 sensor) and 5 megapixels (Samsung sensor) with an aperture of f / 0.95 to f / 5.6 and a dual LED flash.  The flash is very interesting - right between the two cameras. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/546/249/1b7/5462491b794f06b4d6dcb1e0e2d1c62d.jpg"><br><br>  Why a dual camera?  Firstly, as the manufacturer claims, with its help, images will be able to compete with photographs from SLR cameras.  But the most important thing for which users love the dual camera is the ability to quickly take a picture, and then adjust the focus later, as it is implemented in the Lytro camera.  One camera with a fixed focus removes distant objects, and the second focuses directly on objects nearby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/553/e7b/aee/553e7baeebae83b50acbfe2900d8f141.jpg"><br><br>  The front camera in Redmi Pro is also 5 megapixels and has a capture angle of 85 degrees - for selfies it is.  And still shoots in 1080p. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/97c/20d/8a3/97c20d8a31c2ad5072774a19aa858dc3.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Redmi Pro Snapshot</i></font> <br><br>  The novelty has a number of important differences from Redmi Note 3. First of all, it is worth noting the fingerprint scanner sensor - it moved from the back to the front panel, as befits a modern smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/353/0f4/d9b/3530f4d9b5b628b9dbdadcfe970025df.jpg"><br><br>  The second is that everyone's favorite SD card slot is back!  More precisely, memory cards use a slot for a second SIM card.  In Redmi Note 3, users really lacked this, especially for customers with a version with 16 GB of internal memory.  In Redmi Pro, you can install microSD up to 256 GB, so taking a version with 128 GB on board is not at all necessary. <br><br>  A set of interfaces is standard: Wi-Fi (802.11 ac / b / g / n), GPS, GLONASS and LTE with VoLTE support.  It seemed that it was still difficult to come up with something new here, but Bluetooth 4.2 LE appeared in Redmi Pro. <br><br>  The screen lock button and volume control rocker are located on the right, on the left, just a slot for two SIM cards or a SIM card and a microSD memory card.  Above the tradition - a 3.5 mm audio jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b6c/ce3/ff8/b6cce3ff8d5781491a2c141648ed506a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/266/b76/42a/266b7642ac33fce95d0eb727680e949d.jpg"><br><br>  All this is controlled with the help of Android 6.0 Marshmallow with MIUI 8 shell. The latter could already be seen by <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/mobile-phones/pp_360563.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">XIAOMI Mi Max</a> - it was the first smartphone with such a shell from this manufacturer.  It seems that it has taken root among customers, which is why Redmi Pro has received support for MIUI 8, which means an even more neat interface, additional features (optimized image viewing system, new application ‚ÄúNotes with password protection, scanner with advanced functions), new dynamic view notifications and more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5b/c67/526/f5bc675260aec4a85cd7ecf877648dba.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps the only drawback for someone will be a non-removable battery, but to attribute this to shortcomings, when every second manufacturer stamps smartphones without direct access to the battery, somehow already meaningless. <br><br>  What colors?  Black, silver, gold - win-win options for the modern market.  And the official prices are painfully sweet: translated into rubles, about 15 thousand for the basic version, 17 thousand for the more powerful and 21 thousand for the "marathon".  With some markups, the cost is likely to differ, but only slightly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d1/d7e/70a/9d1d7e70a8b24fd8f1433695a38edf4c.jpg"><br><br>  So far, Redmi Pro cannot be bought even in China, but if you want to know about its appearance and price first, <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_421899.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">sign up for updates on GearBest</a> ! <br><br>  And so that the wait was not so painful, you can get already well-proven smartphones from XIAOMI.  For example, a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_294066.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">black XIAOMI Mi 5</a> with 64 GB of internal memory, 3 GB of RAM and a fingerprint scanner can be snatched at an attractive price with the promo code XiaoMiMi56. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/869/e9f/95a/869e9f95a86c96e8dae25f4d04afc922.jpg"><br><br>  Also until August 23, there is a sale on the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_368084.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">XIAOMI Mi4</a> with 64 GB of internal memory, 3 GB of RAM and a 5-inch IPS Full HD display.  The main thing - do not forget the coupon GBXiaoMiMi4. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/953/647/cb0/953647cb062c0bd1d98fa2a90e799f4d.jpg"><br><br>  And finally - a big sale Mi4S with 3 GB of RAM, 64 GB of internal memory, a 13 megapixel rear camera, a fingerprint scanner and support for fast charging.  Available in <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_325301.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">gold</a> , <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_325302.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">white</a> and <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_348586.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">light purple</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f10/2be/37d/f102be37db5e1c57ec6dad8bd4c84658.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396427/</a></p>
