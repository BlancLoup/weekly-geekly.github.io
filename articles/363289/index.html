      ES: - So far, the device that we have is not preparing.  So it can be focused mainly on B2B clients, such as restaurants, catering companies, bakeries, cafes, etc.  The next version will probably include some cooking technologies, so it will be targeted at the home, end user.  It will be a phased approach, we start with B2B, then we will try to be present in all the cuisines of the world. <br><br>  <b>F .: - A question for business.</b>  <b>Tell me, how do you see the return on investment for small, small restaurants?</b> <br><br>  ES: - When we talk to our customers, restaurants, etc., we tell them that they will be able to return their investments in one or two months.  This is an inexpensive device, about 1000 euros, <br>  and it gives them the ability to customize and the ability to do things that they cannot do now.  So the return of investment is very fast. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Emilio, tell me why you chose this name Nature Machines, because some people believe that a food 3D printer prints artificial food.</b> <br><br>  ES: - Yes, this is true, many people believe that if we talk about a food 3D printer, we are talking about artificial and chemical substances, etc.  But it's quite the opposite, we are trying to help people prepare dishes that they can make at home, not wasting time, but using fresh ingredients.  That is, they will use normal food anyway.  In the end, we have an idea that this device is really a mini factory at home.  That the same ingredients that you use will be used, nothing special, nothing artificial.  The device is created to help people come home to cook with fresh ingredients. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Emilio tell me where you can find interesting recipes for the Foodini printer?</b> <br><br>  E.S .: - The device is connected to the access point and works on Android and the way to work with it is through mobile applications, one of which is the recipe store, where you can download your recipe, download other recipes.  There will be some recipe tips for beginners, so you can create your own food, or choose from a database, or see what other users are doing. <br><br>  <b>F .: - And this is another question.</b>  <b>We understand what ‚Äúslicing‚Äù is in conventional 3D printers.</b>  <b>What is "slicing" in Foodini.</b> <br><br>  ES: - Basically you are talking about the program for slicing.  We create our own slicing program, because those that work with traditional materials for printers are not suitable for us, so we have our own slicing program. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Emiliro, and we are interested in, does the Foodini cord go on sale?</b> <br><br>  ES: - Thus, in the coming weeks until the end of the year we intend to start taking pre-orders, and these pre-orders will be sent in the first half of next year, most likely in the summer.  Although we will have several devices made earlier, in March or April, but these will be test samples.  They will be for some testers and some specific clients. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Emilio, or you can ask for a tour of your office and show where Foodini is created.</b> <br><br>  ES: - Come on, I will show you our office.  We are a start-up company, because we work in an open space, we are 15 people who create Foodini. <br>  We are located in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãin a building that belongs to the city council. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Well, we, of course, are interested in seeing the Foodini printer itself.</b>  <b>You can show us to him.</b>  <b>Emilio, tell me, does your siesta go along with Foodini?)</b> <br><br>  ES: - We would like to, but this is not allowed yet!  Here we have one Foodini on which we experience new features. </div></div><br><br>  This was an interview with the creator of Foodini, the world's first 3D food printer, Emilio Sep√∫lveda.  And exactly one week later we are waiting for you to visit the largest exhibition Euromold together.  See you! <br>  Especially for 3D printer shop <br><br> <a href="http://www.fabbers.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75d/4b9/896/75d4b98969de4df6ae22e6e89bb150aa.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363289/</a></p>
