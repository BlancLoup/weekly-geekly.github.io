The volume of the print media market in Russia in 2010 amounted to $ 2.3 billion.  The potential volume of the Russian sales market for periodical press sales in electronic form, thus, is about $ 500 million. <br>  The authors of the <a href="http://www.yourpress.ru/">‚ÄúYour Press‚Äù project</a> are among those who have already begun to test abstract figures in practice.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/digital-printing/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c2/9a3/9fd/7c29a39fd0b3ec969f5035ff9910883d.png" align="left">  British journalist Catherine Whitehorn is known, among other things, as the author of the aphorism "Find something you like to do, and then find someone who will pay you for it."  In spite of the seeming elementary nature of this rule, not everyone can achieve it. <br>  All your life you have written devastating reviews in which you appealed to Plato, then to Kant, but your talent was buried under a pile of office papers.  You are the best in the world weaving bead lampshades, but your fellow programmers can only guess about this suspiciously developed fine motor skills. <br>  The site <a href="http://www.littlehelp.ru/">Littlehelp</a> is made in order to prevent hidden talents from remaining in the shadows.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/the-theory-of-small-deeds/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30f/de4/c2c/30fde4c2ccc9d241b2322cf501a56c09.png" align="left">  It‚Äôs difficult to tell about the IT-Factory project: the service is now at the beta stage, investments are being sought directly for launching - payment for service, advertising and salary to developers.  Nevertheless, its author, Artyom Tatarinov, told everything as it is and even promised to send screenshots ‚Äúas soon as they turn on the electricity‚Äù. <br>  Until then, he explained the essence of the project: ‚ÄúIT-Factory is a place where developers and users unite.  The main essence of the project is to provide product developers with the opportunity to contact their customers. ‚Äù  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/factory-method/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b2/7f2/7aa/5b27f27aad198168e42d877bb6a5cf9e.png" align="left">  Why do we more often update the Facebook feed of friends than read news sites?  The answer is obvious: the news that people from the list of friends share pass through a lot of filters (including those you have installed), so you read only what you are interested in, be it the <a href="http://www.rus-obr.ru/ru-web/12720">news about the legalization of marijuana in Georgia</a> , which was posted by the most peaceful friends , or less large-scale accomplishments - for example, a sudden witty comment to someone about 1001 off hot water. <br>  It seems to allow you to see only what is interesting to you.  On the other hand, it severely limits: no matter how versatile your friends are, your interest in separate processing of garbage or crustaceans is hardly shared by at least one of them.  So, all the news on the topic you have to look at a separate resource. <br>  The creators of <a href="http://netflip.ru/">Netflip</a> figured out how to step over this contradiction.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/did-you-know-that/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c2/274/e3f/0c2274e3f5300bb80fa7e5d9d6878878.jpg" align="left">  ‚ÄúWould you like all the food products and the companies representing them to be in the same directory?‚Äù  So that in just a couple of mouse clicks you can find the product you are interested in, compare it with its peers and see the reviews and rating of the company representing it?  Or would you like to have an Internet portal, where all the names of your products would be visible to your potential buyers? ‚Äù <br>  It is assumed that if you read these questions, you are already on the <a href="http://foodcatalog.ru/">FoodCatalog</a> site <a href="http://foodcatalog.ru/">.</a>  And that from minute to minute all your affirmative answers to these questions will become a reality.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/menu-for-restaurateurs/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fe/b2b/3b2/6feb2b3b241dca95b1e8a6f1604e3259.png" align="left">  Service <a href="http://dealworldwide.com/">Deal Worldwide</a> allows you to simplify the process of buying in online stores to the mark "easier to go."  With the help of the service, purchases can be made on all major trading floors of the world, without registering in each individual online store. <br>  ‚ÄúWe use the principle of relaying offers of trading platforms and stores, which allows our customers to make purchases at all sites connected to us, having only one account - in our system, plus a search toolbar with the ability to view trading platforms through the service interface, which will provide the user with an instrumental a panel whose goal is to translate the page into the desired language, as well as instantly add goods to the user‚Äôs cart without leaving the current page, ‚Äùexplains the author of  EKTA Vitaly Shleina.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/shopping-in-the-visa-free-regime/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0cb/0dd/11e/0cb0dd11e265896dd8e328bae6c5af3c.jpg" align="left">  For full-time work, it is customary to go to sites of recruiting giants like <a href="http://hh.ru/">HeadHunter</a> .  Freelancers are usually searched for specialized resources like <a href="http://free-lance.ru/">free-lance.ru</a> , <a href="http://weblancer.net/">weblancer.net</a> or <a href="http://freelance.ru/">freelance.ru.</a> Another way to find a side job is with specialized communities in <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a> or word of mouth.  For users of the age category up to 30, a fairly obvious solution is a social networking app.  However, if you send <a href="http://vk.com/">VKontakte a</a> search query with the keyword "freelance", the list of offers found will be quite small.  At the very top of it - the application with the laconic name <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/allfreelance">"All Freelance."</a>  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/all-the-freelance/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/all-the-freelance/"><br><br></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d5/5ce/d86/1d55ced8681b5676d8823fedc7a36789.png" align="left"><br>  The traditional Friday corporate party is coming to an end, and you realize with crystal clarity that the only way to get home alive is to order a taxi.  Around noisy, and you can already speak with difficulty.  Finding among colleagues someone who would be qualitatively different from the described condition is also not possible. <br>  In this case (and another couple of thousand of its variations), there are taxi order services available via the Internet, available as mobile applications.  Recently, their ranks have been replenished with another service - <a href="http://intaxi.ru/">InTaxi</a> .  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/e-mobility/">+++</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d10/324/a01/d10324a01f40cb1eb9e4a668dd7ec99f.jpg" align="left">  The essence of the service <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/videolubitel">"Video Wave"</a> its creators explained the most lucidly: <br>  ‚ÄúThe goal of the project is to solve two big tasks: for the viewer ‚Äî what to see in the evening of exactly what you like, the distributor of cinema and TV content ‚Äî see more with us, exactly what you like, and come back to us again and again ".  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/the-wave-function/">+++</a> <br></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125855/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125855/</a></p>
