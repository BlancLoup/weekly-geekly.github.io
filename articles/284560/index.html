And then content producers will lower prices, will be loyal to users and almost will not distribute everything for nothing.  Is it going to be like this?  It seems that not at all. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Not so long ago, I decided to buy a video monitor for the subway.  Any cheap noname did not want to buy, so the choice fell on the <b>PSP</b> .  I went to a decent store and bought it.  After a month with films in the subway, I also wanted to play and read books on it. <br><br>  It all started with the fact that I started looking for a <b>fb2 reader</b> .  I found several applications, downloaded it according to the instructions, but they do not start.  He began to scratch his head and google.  It turned out that only specially signed games can be downloaded to the PSP.  Okay, no problem, for sure there is some PSP Store where I can find a reader in 5 minutes and buy it.  Found.  This ‚ÄúPSP Store‚Äù turned out to be a program that works only in Windows, called ‚ÄúMedia Go‚Äù.  I had to load Windows.  As it turned out in vain.  In the assortment of this ‚ÄúMedia Go‚Äù there were only games for children and casual ones.  No readers and any other applications were found at all. <br><br>  Okay, probably all sorts of applications will be on UMD-drives.  Started looking.  Alone games.

      Okay, I'm a programmer, I'll write the reader myself and use it.  Started looking for SDK.  SDK is paid, prices are not specified, the decision to sell is made in each case individually. <br><br>  Hah, what happens?  I have a fairly powerful device, in all respects it surpasses my smartphone, on which I used to read books, and I cannot put the program I need there, despite the fact that it is distributed absolutely free.  And why?  Because Sony decides what can run and what does not.  But I didn‚Äôt want to do anything illegal. <br><br>  And what do you think?  I started thinking about hacking the PSP and installing everything I needed there.  But it turned out that the PSP versions that have not yet figured out how to hack have long been released, and I am one of the owners of this new generation of devices. <br><br>  And what do we get in this world without piracy?  Devices on which you can install only what the manufacturer has authorized.  Game development for those who buy the SDK for fabulous money.  And the games themselves in the shops for 1500/2000/2500 rubles.  This is despite the fact that the most expensive for the PC are 1500, and usually 600. <br><br>  Here it is the triumph of the copywriters! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Do you think I'm not ready to pay for a program to read FB2 books?  Very willing to pay if it will cost an adequate amount and will be sold at all.  However, the current situation is such that no programs in the PSP Store are allowed, the programs themselves exist and are only put on hacked PSPs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284560/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284560/</a></p>
