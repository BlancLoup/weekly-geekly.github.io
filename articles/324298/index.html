This is exactly what causes the most important first difficulties.  All the details and teams - is a matter of technology.

    <h3>  Theory </h3><br>  I started with the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032625.do">Openstack Operation Guide</a> .  She is a bit old (2014) and about the release of Icehouse, which in the world of constantly-updated OpenStack has long faded into oblivion, however, there are not many teams and listings there, and it allows you to dive into virtualization without choking. <br><br>  By the way, there is a good translation of it on <a href="http://support.mdl.ru/OpenStack.Operations.Guide/index.htm">the Module website</a> .  <i>Honestly, you can also download the original PDF</i> . <br><br>  If the listings are for you, then they are in abundance on <a href="http://xgu.ru/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8_OpenStack_Beginner%25E2%2580%2599s_Guide_for_Ubuntu_-_Natty">xgu.ru.</a> <br><br><h3>  Practice </h3><br>  When everything is clear with architecture, we proceed to practice. <br><br>  There are three options: <br><br><ol><li>  The most useful.  Find 2-3 iron horses and manually install OpenStack on them from scratch by module or DevStack (a special set of scripts that puts everything into automatic (yeah, yeah, we know these machines)). <br><br></li><li>  The middle ground.  One powerful PC + Ubuntu + DevStack (or also by module).  Installation in this case is simple, but if there is still virtualization between Ubuntu and the server, you will have to tinker with the network settings - by default, OpenStack's virtual machines will not ping from the controller nodes. <br><br></li><li>  The most simple.  Subscribe to <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/openstack/training/course/name/openstack-foundation-certified-openstack-administrator">COA course on linuxacademy</a> .  At the same time you get access to all training materials and labs. </li></ol><br>  The minus of the first two, that you are not given a structured training plan.  I turned to the 3rd method, but at the same time I put WMWare + Ubuntu + Devstack on my weak laptop, where I later launched an instance with CentOS - plus this one in that you can take one of the latest releases.  At the same time, you can make a snapshot of the virtual machine and, having started from it later, forget about everything that was done before the open-stack and start from scratch.  Minus, as I said above, not everything is simple with the network. <br><br>  On Linux 43 hours of content detailed video recorded by the coach with impeccable diction, and a set of labs.  Laba is naked Openstack without any pre-settings.  That is, they differ from each other only Lab-guides.  Conveniently, the learning process is organized and you always know what to do and in what sequence.  This is very convenient, since, generally speaking, the open-stack is still a topic for a rather narrow circle of specialists, materials and smart guides, not so much.  You can, of course, prepare yourself with the method of intuition, trial and error, but only if you work with the open-stack every day. <br><br>  After I have already passed the exam, I can say that the course on Linux covers most of the program, but not all.  I have seen things that have never even appeared in instructional videos, for example, domains / groups or multi-mode installation. <br><br>  The subject of Heat and stacks is very poorly disclosed, but there are no labs at all.  And the tasks were met, albeit relatively simple.  Well, in general, if in theory everything is sorted out well, then the tasks for labs are short and simple. <br><br>  However, with regard to the complexity of the tasks, they are exactly the same as in the labs on Linux, nothing supercomplex. <br><br>  For example, when I first started preparing, I thought that tasks would update the release of Openstack from the level with minimal interruption of the service.  No, everything is much simpler. <br><br><h2>  How to take? </h2><br>  Traditionally, this is all kept in the strictest confidence: both the procedure and the tasks themselves.  However, it is known that the exam is practical and aims to identify the student's experience in supporting the existing infrastructure.  This means that there are no theoretical questions with answer choices - just a task to do something in one of two ways - through a terminal or a web interface. <br><br>  I, as a novice, 2.5 hours turned out to be right next to.  Most of the tasks are relatively simple. <br><br>  You need to be prepared for the fact that the console and the web interface are not identical - not everything can be done in the GUI.  However, the GUI, in my opinion, is still a faster way to do the bulk of the tasks, rather than manually typing names or copying a UUID.  Therefore, in the preparation of pumping both skills. <br><br>  You cannot open new tabs in the browser or other applications except the browser in no case ‚Äî if you try to download the credenitals file and copy the contents to the console ‚Äî just a warning for opening the notebook. <br><br>  With the permission of the proctor, you can open an additional tab with the documentation <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/">docs.openstack.org</a> .  In general, all with the permission of the proctor. <br><br>  DO NOT USE Ctrl + W!  Just make your smart hands a couple of weeks before the exam to stop using this hotkey. <br><br>  Since I constantly work in the console, control-in is already a reflex, even if it paralyzes me, my fingers will twitch a couple of times a day. <br><br>  Hope was on the Yandex browser that he would not close the tab in which case.  He did not give.  But the exam was interrupted - just a white window.  I didn‚Äôt really break the laptop. <br><br>  But the proctor was supportive and allowed me to continue the exam - it looks like I'm not the first, not the last.  And the second time he also resolved.  Therefore, Ctrl + W is still not a sentence. <br><br>  Documentation really helps out if you forgot the command syntax or how to do something at all.  For example, help - it turns out to execute not for all commands to display a list of parameters, but I generally copied the method of setting the file lifetime in a swift - from the example. <br><br>  Understanding how to create rc files will be helpful. <br><br>  The requirements for the environment, both on the computer and in the room are described in detail in the <a href="http://www.openstack.org/coa/handbook">handbook</a> , therefore, briefly. <br><br><h4>  At the exam are needed: </h4><br><ul><li>  Camera, </li><li>  Open internet access </li><li>  International passport, license or other document where there is a photo and name / surname in English. </li><li>  Brom Chrom / Chromium (Yandex also came up). </li><li>  Installed in the browser add-on to provide access to the screen (Innovative Exams Scrrensharing). </li><li>  The absence of any other applications or tabs is just one window with the exam. </li><li>  The absence of papers, pens, drinks, food and other things on the table. </li></ul><br><h4>  Recommend: </h4><br><ul><li>  Large monitor </li><li>  Pee in advance - 2.5 hours is quite a long time, and time is given almost back to back. </li><li>  Since the questions can move only linearly, it is better to try not to skip them - a lot of time is spent on skimming. </li><li>  If you missed a question and you need to remember its number, create a text file in the terminal and write them there along with comments. </li><li>  Do not worry too much when you first try - Openstack gives the second for free.  In my case, it turned out that on the first attempt I understood which topics were not covered in the preparation process, how to manage time, that a small monitor is a pledge if not a failure, then a nervous tension, and traveling between questions back and forth is boring and resource intensive. </li></ul><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.openstack.org/coa">Registration link</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://cert.openstack.org/portal">Link to portal</a> <br><br>  The exam is held on the specialized website <a href="https://www.examslocal.com/">www.examslocal.com</a> .
