A lot of interesting new models appeared on sale, and prices became much more affordable.  Of course, for the time being, drones are not selling ‚Äúby the ruble per kilogram‚Äù, but still much more enthusiasts can afford such a gadget. <br><br>  Of course, the most interesting way to use drones is photo and video.  Again, this year around the world many great videos were shot, showing the world from such angles that were previously simply impossible.  And for this alone you need to carry the developers and manufacturers of these wonderful devices.

      For everyone seriously considering joining the world of drones, we offer a small overview of seven models that are equipped (or can be equipped) with a video camera. <br><br>  Also, information about prices has been added to the post, but we will immediately make a reservation: in the conditions of the currency rodeo and the availability of old stocks, the indicated prices can be VERY approximate. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  DJI Phantom 2 Vision + </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f7/b46/31c/4f7b4631c2284d79949f0ad30050ec08.jpg"><br><br>  An updated version of the previous model Phantom 2 Vision appeared in April of this year.  Today it is one of the most "long-playing" quadcopters, it is able to stay in the air for up to 25 minutes.  Vision + is equipped with a suspension for a camera with a three-axis stabilization, has an increased range of the Wi-Fi module and is able to autonomously move along a route consisting of 16 control points. <br><br>  The camera is equipped with a CMOS-matrix with a resolution of 14 megapixels, can shoot in formats Adobe DNG and JPEG.  There are two video modes available: 1080p / 30 fps and 720p / 60 fps.  The camera also allows you to adjust ISO, exposure compensation, white balance and field of view: 140, 120 or 90 degrees. <br><br>  It is controlled by a drone from Android or iOS devices, it is equipped with an inertial sensor, a barometric altimeter, a compass, GPS and LED indicators. <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : from 55,000 rubles, from $ 1,100. <br><br><h4>  Blade 350 QX3 AP Combo RTF </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/010/9a1/9ad/0109a19ad94546b2b58a6da86bb8f1df.jpg"><br><br>  This drone looks simpler than the previous one, but its price is lower.  It is equipped with a beskollektorny suspension with a three-axis stabilization and has three flight modes that can be chosen depending on your skill of the operator and the required quality of shooting.  There is an automatic return to the base in case of loss of communication with the "pilot". <br><br>  The resolution of the camera is 16 MP, it shoots video up to 1080p / 60 fps.  The updated transmitter controls the slope of the suspension, returning it to the neutral position if necessary. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tdM4JHIBRXU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhDisLq88dWiGXvSA29M0vw7p8lVA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The autonomous flight time is 10-15 minutes; it is controlled from an Android or iOS device.  Plastic frame. <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : from $ 600. <br><br>  Also note the previous model, the 350 QX2.  It is much cheaper, but also simpler: a suspension with two-axis stabilization, a camera is simpler, the flight time is about 10 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a4/5a4/622/2a45a46223824d8f87a149095336a596.jpg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ft23BrvxqTU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhtMDxAVKoq3RmLvba0TNzr5y-lAQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : from 22,000 rubles, from $ 470. <br><br><h4>  Parrot rolling spider </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8de/0c8/788/8de0c8788760471d94ed46045ae1e782.jpg"><br><br>  This is the simplest quadcopter in our review.  Being 10 cheaper QX3, it is much closer to toys.  The flight duration is no more than 8 minutes, and the battery recharge time is 90 minutes.  The camera is fixed, takes vertically down and only photos, VGA resolution.  It is controlled from a smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth.  The drone is equipped with a three-axis gyroscope, an acceleration sensor and an atmospheric pressure sensor.  It is recommended to immediately purchase spare blades, they are not included.  When you turn on the "ace" mode, by pressing one button, the drone can quickly turn 90 or 180 degrees. <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : from 5400 rub. <br><br><h4>  Parrot bebop drone </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65c/2d7/ee0/65c2d7ee02484d9a8fe1c4f05f92415a.jpg"><br><br>  "Adult" drone from the same manufacturer.  The camera is fixed, 14 megapixels, the angle of the field of view is 180 degrees.  Video resolution up to 1080p, photos can be saved in Adobe DNG or JPEG format. <br><br>  Drone supports GPS, GLONASS and Galileo.  If navigation satellites are not available, a vertical camera, an ultrasonic sensor, and an atmospheric pressure sensor are used to prevent drift.  There is a function of automatic return to the base and the possibility of programming the flight route. <br><br>  The autonomous flight time reaches 11 minutes, but with wind and fast movement, the duration of work is reduced.  By the way, the drone can fly at speeds up to 75 km / h.  If desired, you can buy a mechanical control panel Skycontroller, which supports virtual reality devices, for example, Oculus Rift.  Management is carried out on Wi-Fi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d52/3c3/8d7/d523c38d79a04a0fbced4d29af218a64.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : from 20,000 rubles. <br><br><h4>  DJI Inspire 1 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e55/61d/094/e5561d09449a4f3f8647b32507c3479b.jpg"><br><br>  This is the first drone in the world with a 4K video camera.  At the same time, it is also the most expensive in this review, almost $ 3000.  True, for the money you get and rich functionality with the appropriate quality. <br><br>  The field of view of the camera is 94 degrees, 4K / 30 fps and 1080/60 fps (12 megapixel) video is possible.  In this case, the camera rotates 360 degrees in the horizontal plane and tilts 125 degrees in the vertical. <br><br>  The drone is controlled either from a mobile device (live broadcast is supported from the camera in 1080p resolution) or from the control panel.  The frame is carbonic, which seriously increases the survivability of the structure.  The drone is equipped with USB, microUSB and HDMI connectors. <br><br>  There is a function of takeoff and landing by pressing a single button.  An auxiliary camera and sensors allow the drone to accurately hang in one place, without drift.  Of course, there is a function of automatic return to the base with the ability to quickly change the coordinates.  Right on the screen of your mobile device, you can draw a route along which the drone should travel.  Flight duration reaches 18 minutes. <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : from 200,000 rubles. <br><br><h4>  3D Robotics IRIS + </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a64/1fe/60b/a641fe60bd75406a9cab9b0eb8042a95.jpg"><br><br>  According to the manufacturer, this is the world's first drone, equipped with the function of automatic following the operator, while the camera is constantly directed at him.  It is possible to keep the focus of the camera at a specific point during the entire flight.  Also, this drone allows you to use GoPro cameras, which is a very important advantage. <br><br>  The number of control points when plotting a route is unlimited, although only Android devices are supported for drawing a route.  You can also use Mac, Windows and Linux clients for flight planning.  Flight time is 15-20 minutes. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_yOCTgVqmeQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg_dF6baWBsI9IMDa4jaQf8ojI6vg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : from $ 750. <br><br>  <i>UPD.</i>  <i>Added prices.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375095/</a></p>
