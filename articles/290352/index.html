    <h4>  Paragraph of prehistory </h4><br>  Once upon a time, almost 10 years ago, a small company was born in Ulyanovsk.  It was hard to call her and the company then - a friendly development team.  But they caught the upcoming trend - the development of e-commerce, and one of the first in Russia began to develop online stores.  Back then, there were legends about Internet commerce, and only daredevils decided to use the online store.  But in the West, this service has become popular.  For 10 years of continuous e-commerce, the competence of the team has grown, and it has increased more than 10 times.  Today, more than 40 developers work in Simtech Development.  We run high-load systems, marketplaces, online stores and online hypermarkets.  And our clients are companies from the USA, Australia, Switzerland, Germany and another 146 countries of the world. <br><br><h4>  Now essentially </h4><br>  Until 2014, our attention was directed to the West, to where the business was successfully developing.  And we didn‚Äôt pay attention to what was going on under our noses.  And in Russia at that time began to appear large online shopping centers with Russian investments, grew up like mushrooms, small and medium-sized online stores.  In addition, Russian web studios began to create cool, strong projects in e-commerce.  Their level has grown significantly.  At the same time, the development did not proceed by forward movements, like in most companies in the West, but as an avalanche in 3 to 5 years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It became extremely interesting to us, what caused such a rapid growth, how companies cope with it, how business processes are built, how they live - in general, the whole Russian business kitchen of web development.  Then we thought that maybe we were not the only ones who would be interested in it, and decided to create our own blog - a collection of success stories of web studios and Internet agencies of Russia. <br><br>  In our blog every month we will meet with leaders of companies - the leaders of the ratings.  We will take a virtual tour of their offices and talk about their unique success story: how to get the first major customer, how much it costs to participate in ratings, how to win tenders and earn the love of famous brands.  Live interviews without cuts and censorship.  We are confident that this experience will be useful to all those who are in the subject, that is, engaged in web development and developing their own Internet business in Russia. <br><br>  The first interview will be released very soon, so be sure to subscribe to our blog if you do not want to miss it.  And if you leave your questions in the comments, we will certainly ask them to the next interlocutor. <br><br>  PS It could have been an impression that we did not work at all in Russia.  This is not true.  At the end of 2014, we entered the Russian market and already managed to be highlighted in ratings ( <a href="http://www.ratingruneta.ru/web/2014/">16th place in the Runet Rating</a> among web studios in Russia and the CIS, <a href="http://www.ratingruneta.ru/web/2013/shop/">1st place among e-commerce developers</a> ).  We also launched several large Russian projects.  And we will move on.  But we will tell about our projects and experience later. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290352/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290352/</a></p>
