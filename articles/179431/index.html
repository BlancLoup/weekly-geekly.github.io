  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HabraReader 2.0 - large client update for iOS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/947/9e5/e58/9479e5e58ac2aff4bbd6fc7bce8d6fbd.png" align="left">  After the release of the first <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169563/">version of</a> HabraReader for iOS, 3 months have already passed - during this time we have done a lot of work to improve the program and today we want to present its results to all readers of habrahabr.  We worked on speed, fixed a number of annoying errors and added a large number of new features, including: <br><ul><li>  access to various sections of the site, including the best and your tape </li><li>  ability to add / edit comments </li><li>  editing your tape </li><li>  vote for user or post </li><li>  synchronization of favorites with the site </li><li>  the ability to view detailed information on the author of the post or the post itself </li><li>  customize font size and type to your liking </li><li>  caching individual posts </li><li>  and much more... </li></ul><br>  Anyone who is interested, welcome under the cat (a lot of screenshots). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  New opportunities </h4><br><h5>  Sections </h5><br>  First of all, the model was redesigned to support various sections of the site.  As a result, a list with all sections was placed in the left pane, and the list of hubs was hidden by a separate button: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/382/336/b08/382336b0835172cf5d284caff856d17b.png"><br><br>  In addition, the option was added to the settings to select the default partition, which will be loaded when the application starts.  This is useful because some users read their feed, some only subject sections, while others only have time to read the best for the week. <br><br>  Also in this list were added a couple of virtual sections with a list of all cached and read posts.  Now, when there is no Internet, you can always find all the posts that you can read now, as well as find an interesting post that you read recently, but did not add to your favorites. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <h5>  detailed information </h5><br>  Now with tapa with a delay on the post with one finger shows detailed information on this post.  The same information can be obtained by reading the post itself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a29/2b5/c23/a292b5c23ba44ca6e153af2712e3ab13.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0dc/333/917/0dc333917c47d4782a107def220827b1.png"><br><br>  Here you can vote for the post (only for authorized users), add / delete to favorites / cache / read, customize the appearance (see below), as well as find out detailed information on the author of the post.  Thus, it is now possible to cache each post individually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b62/2ff/a4c/b622ffa4c413348ea590686a902b2b4e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a16/b9c/65e/a16b9c65e621a62372df93d1df7cef88.png"><br>  As can be seen in the screenshot, you can not only learn about the author in detail, but also vote for him (again, if there is authorization). <br><br><h5>  Settings </h5><br>  For each person, the convenience of the headset and the font size are individual, so we decided to add these settings to the program.  You can call them from the detailed information on the article and change it to your liking.  You can also customize the font independently in the list of posts and when reading each specific post: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a01/0d6/567/a010d6567957220adac7d2f975632ae6.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eea/802/233/eea80223317691f0435fa5959bc56f02.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c35/0cd/1e6/c350cd1e61708a972f6a593c0b3a43e8.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea0/b97/acc/ea0b97accf12fb8e9f29c79e2e114507.png"><br><br><h5>  Authorization </h5><br>  One of the biggest changes in the new version was the support for authorization and all the new features that follow from this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fba/edf/961/fbaedf96165c8ddf02e606b00df97b38.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af8/2ea/189/af82ea18926d4e4269541bfdd662b53c.png"><br><br>  First of all, an authorized user can now read his tape in the list of sections and edit it!  This is done by simply using the switch in the hubs tab: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/274/94d/1a8/27494d1a86402b91a99d4f6b5343b9f4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/716/f45/9eb/716f459eb1a588c47ba6480d91d0b189.png"><br><br>  In addition, you can now synchronize all your favorites on your device with your favorites on the site.  And 3 modes are supported: <br><ul><li>  Combine all favorites on the device and on the site.  The merging of the list of favorites from the device and from the site will be built and then all the missing posts will be added both to the device and to the site. </li><li>  Setting the list of favorites as on the site.  The current list of favorites on the device will be deleted and the list from the site will be downloaded in its place. </li><li>  Set your favorites list as a device.  The list of favorites on the site will be replaced with the list of favorites from the device. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f3/264/b41/1f3264b411114ef857cc9c95de7c784c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a2a/627/44a/a2a62744aece067dc6157617aceeb044.png"><br><br>  You can also add comments when reading the article and vote for them: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/844/414/d36/844414d3691c9e18e5667ac15662c8cf.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fd/f80/b9a/9fdf80b9afa444d790a2bc4d1f034404.png"><br><br>  And, of course, you can always monitor your rating and karma. <br><br><h4>  Fixes </h4><br>  The first version suffered from some childhood diseases that we tried to fix. <br><br><h5>  Smooth scrolling </h5><br>  The smoothness of the scroll was not impressive.  It was with the correction of this ailment that we began developing version 2.0.  First, we threw the wrapper into the PrettyKit classes of each post, then turned on the loading of all the pictures to habracut immediately upon loading the posts.  For the iPhone, we changed the grouping style of the table to a simple one, which also had a positive effect on the smoothness of scrolling.  In addition, we significantly reduced the intensity of recalculating the size and layout for each post, as well as optimized internal caches. <br><br><h5>  Advertising </h5><br>  Another annoying moment was the advertisement in the list of posts, which made it difficult to press the download button for the next posts.  With it, we did just by moving it to the reading screen of a particular post. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  We tried very hard to make the new version like and leave only positive emotions.  I hope all owners of iOS devices will read this post (and all subsequent ones) already through HabraReader and will not remain disappointed. <br><br>  Program support is available <a href="http://vk.com/habrareader">here</a> . <br>  The price of the version without ads reduced by 66%. <br>  The application itself can be downloaded at <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/habrareader/id594091385">this</a> address. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179431/</a></p>
