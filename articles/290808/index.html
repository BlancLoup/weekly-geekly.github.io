We have here a small case to increase calls from the site.  <a href="http://xn--80aqafbhumk6b.xn--p1ai/">KraskiHoli.rf</a> provided us with call statistics before and after installing Rocket Callback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ad/a8c/14f/6ada8c14fa6b4f19be3e30cde084ad69.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A little about the company.  Site <a href="http://xn--80aqafbhumk6b.xn--p1ai/">KraskiHoli.rf</a> .  Engaged in the sale and supply of Indian holi colors used for festivals.  On the market for about 3 years.  We started preparing for the summer festivals since March - we checked several widgets, saw that they didn‚Äôt differ from each other, and so they chose just someone who offered the same quality at the lowest price - that is, us.

      Rocket was installed on the site on April 1, 2015.  As the company said, every year in April, interest in paints of holi rises sharply, as the season of festivals begins.  At the same time, an advertising campaign is launched and, accordingly, site traffic is growing sharply. <br><br>  Test 7 minutes were spent on the first day, after which the company first bought 50 minutes from us, then another 50, and then 4 times for 1000. We have call statistics for the period January-April 2015: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5e/f02/18a/c5ef0218a73c4928b2dea73cf031c612.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And statistics for the same period in 2014: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfa/baf/e18/dfabafe1874c4ba191a7fd9ddbd908a4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Total call statistics for the entire 2014: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abe/ffa/009/abeffa0098174936930add6fc2663d52.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the same time site traffic has not changed much.  Here are the figures for January-February 2015: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/921/2ce/b26/9212ceb26a6e4dc68d02e142c6dffdcf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Attendance statistics for the same period of 2014: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/034/274/656/03427465610d49dd97fd12ad35a76c11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Similarweb <a href="http://www.similarweb.com/website/xn--80aqafbhumk6b.xn--p1ai">shows</a> the same thing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89f/fd1/cc9/89ffd1cc97db45d5b72a95d88eb1c031.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Numbers.  The company bought 4,100 minutes from us, which cost it 56,000 rubles, taking into account the dollar rate at the beginning of April 2015.  As can be seen from the graphs, attendance remained about the same, while the number of calls increased 18 times.  If we take into account that in April the site was visited by 7800 people, then it turns out that approximately every fourth visitor used the widget in April.  Each conversation lasted an average of 2-3 minutes. <br><br>  Conversion.  We ourselves were interested to know what kind of profit our Rocket brings in this particular case, but it was not possible to calculate the exact number of transactions closed through the widget - a person can call and ask today, and buy paint in a week.  However, the company told us that if last year 58 tons of paint were sold, then this year this figure was almost reached, and about 120 transactions were closed remotely through Rocket - customers from distant regions, who were using the usual telephone conversation would have cost too much. <br><br>  The reasons.  Of course, Rocket could not catch such a number of calls in January or even February - there is no traffic, no one to call.  However, if a warm visitor came to the site, who drove into the search engine ‚Äúto buy paints of holi‚Äù, then the probability that he would order a callback is rather high.  Here we must take into account that a similar result was achieved thanks to a set of measures: SEO (according to key requests, such as ‚Äúbuy paints of holi‚Äù, ‚Äúpaints of holi moscow‚Äù and so on, the site is kept in the top-10), contextual advertising and callback widget. <br><br>  Here is a small case from our friends.  Today, the company bought another 1000 minutes, since the hottest time ahead is May and June.  According to forecasts for 2015, it is planned to sell 160 tons of paint, we hope that they will succeed and <a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">Rocket Callback</a> will help them with this. <br><br>  We have it all <br>  Thank you for reading us! <br>  Subscribe to our <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/rocketcallback">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290808/</a></p>
