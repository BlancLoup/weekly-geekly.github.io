      There is a small problem in the package - due to a slightly ill-conceived construction, the power button was pressed against the wall and pressed during the journey.  Actually, the tablet comes seriously discharged, and there were problems with it - either the battery does not hold at all, or the input transistor breaks through the input with a large current.  It would be good to check with the seller whether a piece of foam will be cut so that the button is not pressed. <br><br>  <b>Packing on: 3</b> <br>  It goes well, but the box looks ascetic and crumples.  No longer donate. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/c7dl-kJ2XXZHw-UMnkz1vg%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eaf/456/903/eaf456903e964546450f83afe1e55165.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  The box contains: the tablet itself, charging (with a carefully placed adapter under our outlet), headphones, a cable for connecting to a computer, an adapter cable for usb-host, and instructions in Chinese. <br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/t33QOnEiKC6wmSDXKRFr3Q%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c2/0b4/8a5/7c20b48a581ac6fac1511c4ccad2ba0b.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  In addition, in addition, I ordered three more different covers, which we will talk about later. <br><br><h4>  Build quality and body </h4><br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5V0KDIFiqBxYp3S3Q2QL5Q%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/085/69b/c2c/08569bc2ca1260505cae4e0b078696cb.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  Here it is, our handsome.  It is assembled with high quality, nothing crunches inside, does not falter and does not hang out.  Structurally, it is assembled in such a way that it simply cannot creak.  If you press - a little bends the screen in the center, relative to the edges of the case.  I think if it will get me - a small drop of rubber sealant under the screen will solve the problem. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/GBTzYd1BFCutUWioL-1jng%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3bd/960/eb4/3bd960eb43eb055c8a50b74cbdfda378.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  Rubber covers of additional ports do not inspire confidence - they do not provide special protection, but they look frankly flimsy - stagger, are very easily removed, but at the same time they complicate access to the connector and card (and the reset button, which is no secret) <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/YbiWUX8kZsMzNWOQU_aaTA%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/56d/8fa/e77/56d8fae7745f43bbc2e46958925deab3.jpg" height="479" width="640"></a> <br>  And now about the good.  Estimate the thickness of the case: 1.7 mm. <br>  On the back cover is an excellent print quality: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/iWaZNn6BMFCai6RbvDcdCQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fda/4f0/997/fda4f099704dd05d4af5fe8a836ba6c4.jpg" height="400" width="300"></a> <br><br>  <b>Build quality on: 4</b> <br>  Not terrible horror, but not ideal.  Although, it is necessary to give him his due - there are no gaps, and the impressive thickness of the rear wall of aluminum pleases.  Inscriptions that behind, that in front (above, which dropad (tm) and pictures of buttons) are executed exactly and accurately. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  The screen is proprietary, from LG, with a resolution of 800 x 480. The touch panel is capacitive, with an honest multitouch on 5 points.  Proof: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t-hIk-4MNYw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgkzc4IfJrwFhfteJBECAscFPgAlQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The screen brightness is sufficient to work on the street. <br>  This is how it looks at full brightness, in direct sunlight: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5lA3lbG53XyIX63PTXNOPg%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad5/d54/560/ad5d54560312898c83e09ecb04fba502.jpg" height="400" width="300"></a> <br>  Of course, until the contrast of electronic paper in the bright sun, not even one LCD screen has grown (well, except that the m505 was equally readable both in the bright sun and in the dark), but it can perform its function in the sun ‚Äî everything is visible. <br><br>  The touchpad is convenient, it responds perfectly - and there are few false clicks, and you don‚Äôt have to spread your whole finger.  For inertial scrolling, easy movement is enough. <br><br>  The only thing that sometimes cuts the eyes - a few pixels on both sides of the screen go under the black border.  Accordingly, if you look at the screen from above - they will not be visible.  Applications that use the standard interface do not use this part of the screen, and those who work with the screen themselves - almost all have border settings (for example, readers).  So no problems <br><br>  Of course, after modern phones with the same resolution, there may be questions about pixel density - after all, for such a screen, I would like more resolution.  But that is something to eat.  Work is still more convenient than on the phone - simply because of the physical size of the screen. <br><br>  <b>Screen on: 4+</b> <br>  Bright, clear, with a good touch panel. <br><br><h4>  Connectors and interfaces </h4><br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/M79CPZoRb0g0On5oly5UEQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/158/cd6/1e2/158cd61e226e62ad0387727bbe45f1cb.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  As you probably could already notice, on the front panel of the tablet there are three buttons that are more or less familiar for Android devices: Home, Menu, and Back.  Touch buttons, which is both a plus and a minus: on the one hand, touch buttons look quite stylish and organic in the overall design, and on the other hand, because  they have no backlight - it would be more convenient to work with physical buttons in the dark. <br>  On the upper surface is the power button (this time not touch): <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/caBdDMCkW7qXKwyWGPQnKA%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bdf/410/55f/bdf41055f5b011d9ce18756deb5e2141.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  On the other side of the top face fit the speaker hole: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/p927IQmGP8vvrrUGp8ah6w%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb3/9dc/669/cb39dc669822ec8e7c5a2588acfc3a80.jpg" height="479" width="640"></a> <br>  On the rounded end there are volume buttons: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mDGXzpYvyPnMHvNhz7vgFg%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ed/e35/1bd/2ede351bd99ff0686d4a7bf055916f44.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  All the buttons are over. <br>  We turn to the lower end, where we see two plugs, a port for charging and a headphone jack. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/2WT5j7MVkQry2tGcnWbKDw%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/779/2cd/d6d/7792cdd6d52419d3b059fe8e830cd4c0.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  Under the left stub is mini-HDMI and microSD connector: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/v2DVZLP2oipebkLe8laUJQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b18/0a2/ae0/b180a2ae085827b4ae929b16862c2baf.jpg" height="482" width="640"></a> <br>  And under the right, a usb-host and a button (or rather a hole) reboot (although it turns off the tablet and does not reboot the tablet. To boot, you must hold down the power button) <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/DcszaT1wAJsR4SwKv3VC2g%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b5a/0e4/a68/b5a0e4a6824a31531abee7ccf1d25fd9.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  Next to the back button is the charging indicator: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/b4cmY7xJr9nx6UNirYqIjg%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/539/37b/449/53937b4497c9458935dd8f5e5f650c27.jpg" height="640" width="478"></a> <br>  Hooray, hooray, he is not blue!  Just red.  While it is charging - it is burning, it stopped charging - it went out.  Despite the two holes, there is one LED. <br><br>  Now about the genius of the Chinese.  Despite the fact that the connector for connecting to a computer is compatible with Mini-USB, it will not be charged from the computer.  Totally.  Why?  But: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/uBODwGOsuvW-ucQLisPsxA%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a4/b37/312/5a4b373124e1565b0775cbb9b897b0a3.jpg" height="300" width="400"></a> <br>  This is a standard charging plug. <br><br>  And this is a mini USB: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VQh8oudvz5TH8OyoUPJORA%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef3/2c4/145/ef32c4145ed8c24830ddf7c847539be4.jpg" height="300" width="400"></a> <br><br>  There are twice as many contacts.  On the contacts on the other side and charging. <br>  Here is the usual USB plug: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/v1kwI1K7KAn03XAyaYSDcQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c2/f86/ee2/0c2f86ee2e7c9d3fad87ced00f5837a4.jpg" height="216" width="288"></a> <br>  But ten-pin: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4-0xXng-QFimQ3UQva-OmA%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d86/122/fce/d86122fce213b0985dd6a719f0fa8f86.jpg" height="240" width="288"></a> <br><br>  By happy coincidence, I found in the bins two such connectors, from which the wires for charging were made. <br><br>  <b>All this economy on: 3</b> <br>  Only because of the unformatted charging connector. <br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br><br>  <b>Operating system: Android 2.2</b> <ul><li>  Truly so!  Initially, there is an assembly of 628, the most stable is 705. There are 817 and 919, this is already from 2.3, but multitouch and wifi are buggy in them.  Links - in the subject on w3bsit3-dns.com.  They promise to release a normal 2.3.  We are waiting, sir. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Processor: Samsung S5PC110 Cortex A8 1000Mhz</b> <br><ul><li>  Same as in the very first Galaxy Tab.  Cortex A8 - this is good, if you like to play - many games no longer run on past architecture. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>RAM (Mb): 512</b> <br><ul><li>  That's the way it is, but 200-220 is available, not more - the rest is occupied by the system. </li></ul><br>  <b>Screen (inches, resolution): 7 "800 * 480</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Screen type: capacitive, touch (multitouch 5 points, LG)</b> <br><ul><li>  I already wrote about him.  Good. </li></ul><br>  <b>Web-comera: Yes</b> <br><ul><li>  More precisely you will not tell.  Skype failed to make it. </li></ul><br>  <b>Wireless WIFI 802.11 b / g / n, GPS navigation, Bluetooth 3.0</b> <br><ul><li>  Wifi is working, bandwidth is not measured - there is no need to watch DVD in the stream, or copy movies over WiFi. </li><li>  GPS is working.  Judging by the time of cold start - the good old Sirf Star III.  Good chipset, what to say.  A-GPS is supported, but I did not notice a special decrease in the cold start time. </li><li>  BT3.  There is nothing to check, it was limited to transferring files to devices from 2.1.  works. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Interfaces: 2pcs Mini USB, HDMI output, microSD connector, Headphone output, external speakers, microphone.</b> <br><ul><li>  One MiniUSB - for the computer, the second - a full host.  Understands flash drives, mice, keyboards.  Webcams and printers are not.  But it works with modems. </li><li>  HDMI is for miniHDMI form factor plug.  due to the absence of the adapter could not try on the TV.  Judging by the discussions on the forums, it supports 720p and 1080p (although it must be rebooted with the cable inserted), and it becomes such a kind of small game console.  And if you connect to the monitor, and turn on the mouse and keyboard through the hub - there will be a nettop. </li><li>  Card included 8gb.  Tests - at the end. </li><li>  3.5 jack breaks with a squeak.  The tablet did not pay attention to the connected active speaker, continuing to play music through the built-in speaker.  Headphones - plow.  Since most of the devices on the android in the music playback mode are eating a battery with the appetite of a pregnant elephant, I prefer to have a separate player. </li><li>  Microphone average scall.  But it works. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>G sensor: Yes</b> <br>  Yeah, it works.

Carefully, a wifi antenna is attached to it. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/PkGh0VDTPIzDH4aGfLK7pQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/93a/6bb/eaf/93a6bbeaf2613423d35e09daa95054ec.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  Here she is: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/iCtL-_bvHajEBqVFuun8yA%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54c/655/9a2/54c6559a26e48ea211c2a02851462a2e.jpg" height="300" width="400"></a> <br><br>  The second antenna connector is GPS.

Of course, do not forget to disable the trains. <br><br>  By the way, one screw I was ripped off - barely unscrewed: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/YjpKowHtEzS4h1U8m_LA8A%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe4/9bd/b34/fe49bdb3481375d23a3881cb5ee9ffc8.jpg" height="299" width="400"></a> <br><br><h4>  Working hours </h4><br>  I understand that each person has his own tasks, and the tablet will work at a completely different time. <br>  After a week of use with this style of work: <br>  It charges all night, in the morning I take off the charge, I download articles to the RSS reader via Wifi, so I switch it off and use it all day.  Three or four hours of reading a book, about an hour of total navigation / map viewing, and an hour of games. <br>  Total about 6 hours of work (with the screen on), and 4-5 hours of waiting.  Coming home, I finish off the rest of the charge with the Internet, and put it on charge. <br><br>  If used only as a reader, the work time will increase to 9-10 hours. <br>  <b>Work time on: 4</b> <br>  Solid four.  Of course, it would be good to have a work time of 24 hours, but the main thing for me is enough for a day.  Arranges. <br><br><h4>  Optional accessories <br></h4><br>  Together with the tablet, I ordered three covers: <br>  1) <a href="http://www.nowsupplier.com/ru/inch-soft-neoprene-sleeve-case-bag-for-android-tablet-black-p-1657.html">Soft neoprene envelope case</a> <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/W3Dez89wyEPeG1XI_zax7w%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/913/1e2/d5a/9131e2d5a7710f305e398544a2ff90ef.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  Bullshit.  I did not like.  It is slightly wider than the tablet, it dangles in it.  A "cover" on the contrary, closes too tight - you have to pull.  Pros - only in the material.  Even Chinese, he cushions very well. <br><br>  2) <a href="http://www.nowsupplier.com/ru/leather-case-with-keyboard-for-inch-mid-tablet-black-p-1576.html">Cover with keyboard</a> <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Bev8DKGX7Y-smDpRcT0J5Q%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/382/417/efe/382417efe398d1e0ed637957b8d18652.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  The keyboard is made quite high quality, the buttons work.  the cover is also quite hard.  The keyboard plug is an ordinary usb, it is connected via a complete adapter.  There are no active parts, so you can replace the plug with a miniusb and add +5 to the convenience. <br><br>  But - personally, I feel uncomfortable.  For typing large texts, I have a laptop, and on the on-screen keyboard, I type faster on a trifle.  For people who buy a tablet as an alternative to a laptop - it will be useful. <br><br>  3) <a href="http://www.nowsupplier.com/ru/inch-leather-case-for-tablet-pc-mp5-ebook-reader-p-1663.html">Simple cover</a> <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/oy93tbKgRyAul9jztKL_IA%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e0/398/985/1e03989859c1a94b5b7fffb5266b855a.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br><br>  My main case.  Quite comfortable, tough enough to protect, the tablet is firmly fixed with rubber bands.  The disadvantage is closing the plugs for the host and the card.  However, the removal of one gum does not particularly impair the mount. <br>  The latch (tail that holds it in the closed state) is quite long.  And it would be better if he was on a magnet, more convenient.  If I find one, I will order. <br>  For a month, the stitches in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãgum mounting certainly stretched out, but it didn‚Äôt get any further - apparently, they aren‚Äôt going to tear. <br><br>  In general, there are no other covers on the 7-inch tablets on the NS.  Only variations of these three. <br>  And I would like something similar: <a href="http://www.nowsupplier.com/ru/10-tablet-pc-exquisite-leather-case-p-1556.html">tyts</a> <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  With all its flaws, a great machine at an attractive price.  Pleases at least not iphone-like design, and the normal time. <br><br>  References: <br>  <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D242281">Topic on w3bsit3-dns.com</a> <br>  Review: <a href="http://ru-sku.livejournal.com/196000.html">one</a> , <a href="http://mysku.ru/blog/dealextreme/1773.html">two</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iTablet/124955/">three</a> , <a href="http://mysku.ru/blog/others/1770.html">four</a> , <a href="http://micdigi.com/2011/05/dropad-a8x-will-come-on-the-stage-with-samsung-pc110-cpu/">five</a> <br><br>  And you can subscribe in order not to miss new reviews <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/">on the company‚Äôs page</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vvzvlad/">in my profile</a> (‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù button) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129355/</a></p>
