  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Douglas Crockford, Azat Mardan, Vitaly Friedman and all-all-all: the announcement of the free YouTube-broadcast HolyJS 2017 Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  <b>Briefly about the event</b> <br>  Conference: <b><a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/">HolyJS 2017 Moscow</a></b> <br>  Date: December 10-11, 2017 <br>  Free webcast (first hall only): <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/online-free">webpage on the official site</a> . <br></blockquote><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q9/nx/sy/q9nxsyf-0fx9kklto1di5e4knqk.png"></p><br><p>  Any JavaScript developer once asks a question: which JavaScript conference to attend?  Interesting reports to listen, people to see, to show themselves.  In 2016, we followed the same path and found that there is nothing suitable in Russia on this topic.  All sorts of mitap on the front - please.  But JS has long been not only the front.  In short, we decided to correct this injustice and created the main and only JavaScript conference in Russia, <a href="https://holyjs.ru/">HolyJS</a> .  On Holi, there is not only a front, but also a backend, a desktop, and even work with hardware.  Now we all have where to go, but this is not the end of the story. </p><br><p>  In the JavaScript world there is an important feature that distinguishes it from worlds such as Java and .NET: technologies and frameworks are developing rapidly.  People who did not go to the conference are at a disadvantage - very few people want to watch records that are obsolete for 4 months.  Usually there are several fundamental reports that you can be proud of and review for a couple of years, but most of the material is interesting and useful in the moment: I looked, I listened, I went to work at work.  Will all this be behind payvollom?  But what about the community and the feeling of elbow?  Is there anything wrong with that? </p><br><p>  <strong>Now you can watch the broadcast of the first hall for free, from our website and on YouTube.</strong>  This allows everyone to join the conference and spend all two days on it.  Coming in live would be cooler, but on this full-scale broadcast you can really dive into the subject and feel the atmosphere of what is happening. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  On the other hand, buyers of paid broadcast are also not offended: there is an opportunity to watch all the rooms in general (that is, three times more reports) and switch between them, plus they buy the service: for example, the priority solution to any problems and guaranteed records of all reports in high quality.  Everything together looks like a fairly balanced and honest decision: we and the community helped, and did not forget ourselves. </p><br><p>  All of the above was about packaging.  What awaits us inside?  A bunch of really fiery reports that lead not anyhow, but people of the first magnitude.  For example, there will be Douglas Crockford and Azat Mardan, if <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/react-quickly">these names</a> <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">tell you something</a> .  Will Vitaly Friedman and Lea Vera.  We understand that Douglas Crockford rarely comes to Russia - so he will have two reports.  And this is only the first room! </p><br><p>  Happy viewing, and may the power of the Most Holy Javascript be with you! </p><br><h1 id="kak-podklyuchitsya-k-translyacii">  How to connect to the broadcast </h1><br><p>  Previously, we posted on Habr links to various playlists on YouTube and warned: ‚ÄúThis link is for the first day, this one is for the second, this one is for something else.‚Äù  You needed to save the link to this habrapost and then follow its updates. </p><br><p>  There is a way much easier.  Free broadcast can be viewed directly from our site, here on this link: </p><br><blockquote><a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/online-free"></a>  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/online-free">https://holyjs-moscow.ru/online-free</a> </blockquote><p>  This link is the ultimate source of truth.  It is there that displays the latest, current program.  Sometime in the distant future, convenient controls for online viewing will appear there, but now for maximum convenience, the YouTube player is simply built in: you can watch from the site (by expanding to the full screen), you can jump on YouTube.  You can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Jwo4Q0s-ucjGseHP8XUSQ">subscribe to our channel</a> to see the records when they are shared. </p><br><h1 id="changelog">  Changelog </h1><br><p>  The development of the conference is very similar to the development of a software platform.  Our languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms constantly compete with each other: for example, Java is chasing .NET by the syntax of the main language, and .NET is trying to catch up with Java by cross-platform, and then they all try to keep up with the convenience and speed of development for JavaScript.  As soon as a new idea appears, implementations of this idea begin to appear in all popular technologies. </p><br><p>  Creating conferences is very similar to the development of a software platform.  JUG.ru Group has its own platform, a list of basic features.  As soon as one of the conferences improves something, everyone else receives an update.  This year, including this fall, there have been many conferences, and many things have improved. </p><br><p>  Live streaming is exactly what we all want and expect to see from a good conference.  To improve the broadcast, it is often enough just to add more high-quality equipment and properly configure it.  Therefore, broadcast received for this autumn the maximum number of useful updates. </p><br><ul><li>  Improved sound quality.  Microphones stand correctly and work better, the acoustics of the hall are thought out, minor technical problems are solved; </li><li>  Video at 1440p - the extra space is used to simultaneously display the speaker and FullHD slides (or the laptop screen for live coding) on ‚Äã‚Äãone screen.  Very useful tech feature; </li><li>  Infrastructure for working with video moved to the cloud, which lowered the probability of equipment failures.  This is done in <a href="http://sbtg.ru/">SBTG.ru</a> , which help in recording the conference, and we are only reaping the fruits of their work; </li><li>  Our service infrastructure also moved to Amazon.  It used to be just Hetzner, but quality uninterrupted transmission is more important; </li><li>  In the intervals between presentations, when speakers and participants on the site are retired to the discussion zones, we show the online broadcast to the audience reports and interviews with speakers and sponsors.  This time the interview should be livelier, two presenters will lead them ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/phillennium">@phillennium</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/olegchir">@olegchir</a> - you can regularly see our posts on Habr√©); </li><li>  Many minor technical problems were solved, which most did not even notice, but they were there.  In general, the feeling of watching the broadcast should be better. </li></ul><br><h1 id="programma">  Program </h1><br><p>  The conference is held for two days.  The first day starts at 10.00, the second - at 10.30.  Each day begins with the opening keyout and ends with the final keyout at 18.15.  The current program of the first hall can be seen <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/online-free">on the broadcast page</a> . </p><br><h2 id="den-pervyy-10-dekabrya">  The first day.  December 10th. </h2><br><p><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eu/vn/6a/euvn6a5keen9tcnr01p2ng0h1yk.jpeg">  Opening keynout.  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/gq7yrvvfgocsckyq68kok/"><b>Douglas Crockford - The Post JavaScript Apocalypse</b></a> </p><br><p>  When in the spring the legendary Douglas Crockford spoke at the St. Petersburg HolyJS <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DZMOdHCDoakY">with the theme ‚ÄúNumbers‚Äù</a> , he casually mentioned that new programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãshould appear: ‚Äúwe cannot leave JavaScript to our children, it would be terrible‚Äù.  And this time, opening the conference with a speech on the ‚Äúpost-Javascript script apocalypse‚Äù, he will cover the topic in more detail.  What should be the language that will eventually javascript?  And what should we do now while it is not yet? </p><br><p><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pm/1t/yv/pm1tyvzjmzkd043eqikvejid8v8.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/3hmyldgekuymaycqcykq60/"><b>Minko Gechev - Faster Angular applications</b></a> </p><br><p>  On the one hand, we all understand the importance of web applications opening and running as quickly as possible.  On the other hand, we are doing cumbersome single-page applications, where it is often required to load many resources at once, and then perform so many calculations in the main thread that the ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù are not surprising.  How to achieve rendering at 60 FPS and fast loading of the Angular application?  Minko is going to talk about both. </p><br><p><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nd/vh/go/ndvhgoqr9r8mtr0u6g3kptqprg8.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/ric1cxycdiu8wykc0wo4k/"><b>Alexey Bogachuk - Security: vulnerabilities of your application</b></a> </p><br><p>  Are the threats of XSS still relevant?  It has been about 20 years since Cross Site Scripting (XSS) appeared as a type of attack.  Since then, we have gained a wealth of experience and knowledge, the protection of our sites has become much more difficult, and numerous frameworks have been designed to protect us from mistakes.  But the latest data shows a completely different picture: in the first quarters of 2017, the number of reports of XSS attacks and the number of vulnerabilities found increased several times. </p><br><p>  Alexey will talk about why your applications are in danger, why frameworks don't save, how to find vulnerabilities and what tools to use for this. </p><br><p><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ax/w6/st/axw6styz70yimgygule_vwhabfo.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/67amybzm9qgug4qggg2uiy/"><b>Vitaly Slobodin - Headless browsers: what, how and why</b></a> </p><br><p>  When looking at the title of the report, many may think: ‚ÄúWhy should I listen to it, I already know what headless browsers are.‚Äù  And indeed, such browsers have long been entered into the lives of developers - with their help they test the code, check the quality and conformity of the layout, and not only.  But the problem is that the developers know little about how their tool works and works.  So the question ‚Äúhow‚Äù from the title is no less important - and many will be able to find an answer for themselves. </p><br><p><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fy/qg/1_/fyqg1_qywwxqrpnaiiypczkipu0.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/2m8yli9bes6e2uaweymeqc/"><b>Nikolai Matvienko - Troubleshooting Node.js Applications Under the Hood</b></a> </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúUnobvious possibilities‚Äù of Node.js, which can be found in the keyout of Azat Mardan, is, of course, great.  But what to do if there is a problem with your Node.js application, and you don‚Äôt need to fix something new, but you need to quickly repair the existing one?  On Nikolay's report you will learn about the possibilities of diagnosing production-applications using debugging and tracing the application at different levels;  on how to track performance problems and memory leaks inside the Node.js application. </p><br><p><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/et/82/11/et8211jbrifwfliolz3oe4hcnfi.jpeg">  The final keyout.  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/1xsrhlexdq0u6koqscsgmc/"><b>Vitaly Friedman - New Adventures in Responsive Web Design</b></a> </p><br><p> About Responsive Web Design speak far not the first year, but over time there are not less questions, but only more.  Browsers began to support HTTP / 2, Service Workers, Responsive Images, Flexbox, SVG, Font Loading API - how is it better to use all this now?  And if you started using what to do with legacy browsers? </p><br><p>  Such questions are right for Vitaly Friedman, co-founder of the famous <a href="https://smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> website.  Firstly, this site has been covering such topics for years, and secondly, the site itself also has to solve such questions for itself.  In general, the lack of expertise here obviously will not. </p><br><h2 id="den-vtoroy-11-dekabrya">  Second day.  December 11th. </h2><br><p><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k_/tk/sa/k_tksapphrtcvmz_p9x1pvw0gga.jpeg">  Opening keynout.  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/60q1ywvrdqcwo8uk0o48as/"><b>Azat Mardan - You don't know Node</b></a> </p><br><p>  As you know, if someone uses JavaScript, this does not mean that he knows JavaScript.  This is evidenced by at least the popularity of the book ‚ÄúYou Don't Know JS‚Äù (she promises to really teach JS even to those who believed that they already know everything).  Azat Mardan states that the situation with Node.js is similar: many developers who deal with it do not quite know its capabilities.  And the keynout ‚ÄúYou don't know Node‚Äù is intended to fix this by showing five non-obvious features. </p><br><p><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yo/gm/_i/yogm_iszczmnqsv3bofp6uubuja.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/6jek48yvww8emsqamakmia/"><b>Anton Lobov - TypeScript, or Why is it so difficult</b></a> </p><br><p>  In just a couple of years, TypeScript managed to turn from another ‚ÄúJavaScript with classes‚Äù into a powerful tool for typing complex JavaScript code.  From the point of view of the developer, everything has become more obvious and more convenient.  But not everything is as obvious as we would like. </p><br><p>  Anton will help to figure out which pitfalls are fraught with the typing offered in TypeScript, why it is so complicated and how it directly influences language support from the IDE and other development tools (sometimes in a very unexpected way). </p><br><p><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eu/vn/6a/euvn6a5keen9tcnr01p2ng0h1yk.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/6z1rnhj1toikmikgoqskyw/"><b>Douglas Crockford - Managing Asynchronicity with RQ</b></a> </p><br><p>  And again Douglas Crockford.  This time, not with a general discussion about the ‚Äúlanguage of the future‚Äù, but with a concrete response to the specific challenges of today.  RQ is a small <a href="http://www.rq.crockford.com/">JS-library</a> from Crockford, designed to help work with asynchrony in server applications.  According to Crockford himself, she "is designed to facilitate the use, and even more so, with the help of minimalism." </p><br><p><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tr/vh/dh/trvhdhmc3zzf06mswctfxpizxfu.png">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/491dtd5v6mcsikkukeyk62/"><b>Pavel Chertorogov - GraphQL: we conclude a lucrative contract between the server and the client</b></a> </p><br><p>  GraphQL replaces the REST API.  GraphQL Model - developed for 2 years by the speaker of the principles of construction, types and relationships.  Pavel will tell how to squeeze all the juices from a typed scheme and static code analysis, and will affect ‚Äúdivine refactoring‚Äù.  There will be a lot of information on the backend. </p><br><p><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qx/m2/eh/qxm2ehyhvqz4ounsd72l5tvmosc.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/6f57ymvefsmu0cweciwc4a/"><b>Martin Splitt - Better, faster, getting more from the web platform</b></a> </p><br><p>  At St. Petersburg's HolyJS, Martin analyzed the rendering performance from the bottom, starting with a single pixel.  This passion ‚Äúto go there, until many do not reach‚Äù is typical for him - and in Moscow he will deal with features that he considers to be either underestimated or too new for public attention.  They will be: Web Workers (for parallel work without blocking the UI stream), Streams API (for working with data as it becomes available, without waiting for the end of the transfer) and WebAssembly. </p><br><p><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/15/ij/it/15ijitsxtmyzvtwjtlqrwnlcafm.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/j4ga7pmp68qiuagkyks2e/">The final keyout.</a>  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/j4ga7pmp68qiuagkyks2e/"><b>Lea Verou - / Reg (exp) {2} lained /: Demystifying Regular Expressions</b></a> </p><br><p>  Lea has already impressed many spectators with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DgweY3L0YA1Y">performance of the</a> spring St. Petersburg HolyJS, and now she will close the Moscow conference with another topic.  "Regular expressions" can seem something chewed a thousand times, and at the same time it is still not completely clear (and therefore frightening).  But Lea is able to explain and demonstrate everything with illustrative examples in such a way that it does not turn out to be either scary or boring.  And if you think that you already know about ‚Äúregulars‚Äù enough and you don‚Äôt need to hear about them again, then there will be a good opportunity to check whether you can really quickly select the right expression in your mind for some non-obvious cases. </p><br><h1 id="ogranicheniya">  Restrictions </h1><br><ul><li>  In the open broadcast, <strong>only the first hall</strong> is available, including keyouts.  You cannot watch what happens in other halls.  And there will be many interesting things.  Next time register and watch everything without restrictions. </li><li>  <strong>There will be no video recordings.</strong>  That is, they, of course, will, but only for conference participants who have left feedback.  And for all the others, we traditionally post them in 3-4 months. </li><li>  An open broadcast is provided on the principle of <em>as is</em> : we are sure that everything will be fine, but if suddenly that - do not judge me!  The participants of the paid closed broadcast receive special support - they are buying exactly the service. </li></ul><br><h1 id="zaklyuchenie">  Conclusion </h1><br><p>  Now all information is available, allowing you to decide whether to watch an open broadcast.  I hope the program turned out to be good, and you wanted to connect to us.  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/online-free/">Address broadcast you already know</a> .  We are waiting for December 10-11 at the conference and at the monitors! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ij/j9/g6/ijj9g6claapfvftetllabpf1stk.png"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0r/tx/bk/0rtxbklzq5ngnrbf2cxjnfdclou.png"></p></div>
