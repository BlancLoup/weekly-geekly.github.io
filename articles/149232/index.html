Outwardly, it practically does not differ from the firstborn - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ulmart/blog/140946/">ASUS</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ulmart/blog/140946/"><br></a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ulmart/blog/140946/">Zenbook UX31E</a> , but the stuffing ... Here lies the mass of surprises <br>  and amenities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e9/757/1e3/6e97571e349af893598a0ee74fe703b1.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And again, the formal part: the introduction and description of the package. <br>  Before you tell us that the ultrabook is packed in a stylish <br>  black cardboard box with the manufacturer's logo and <br>  image <br>  the device itself, I will make a lyrical digression. <br>  Every ultrabook is doomed to be compared to a MacBook Air (partly myself <br>  also fueled this interest), but what a thing.  The brand <br>  Ultrabook is promoted by Intel, not Microsoft.  In macbook <br>  Intel processors are installed, which means that sales of processors <br>  do not fall and the iron part in any case will bring profit <br>  Intel  What is the advantage of ultrabooks - in a faster update <br>  rulers, in a wider model range, in a variety of colors and shapes. <br>  How many MacBook Air models have been released?  7 models from the beginning of 2008 <br>  of the year.  There is no point in talking about the number of ultrabooks, they appeared <br>  much more over the last year.  Can you still talk about what's new <br>  technologies appear faster in ‚Äúordinary‚Äù ultrabooks, but I think <br>  has spoken enough to wake the volcano in the hearts <br>  Apple lovers (by the way I am an iPhone and iPad owner and I don‚Äôt have <br>  nothing against the Cupertino company).

      And now about ASUS Zenbook UX31A.  As I said, the model looks almost <br>  no different from the debut version - ZenBook UX31E, so on the exterior <br>  I will not get hung up. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e9/757/1e3/6e97571e349af893598a0ee74fe703b1.jpg"><br>  The delivery package completely repeats the predecessor: power adapter, <br>  Ultrabook case, USB-Ethernet adapter, miniVGA-VGA adapter and <br>  special case for accessories. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e79/e63/d22/e79e63d22d67aabf37ccc905ab1cd317.jpg"><br>  The power adapter is still compact, it is still glued to it <br>  Windows license sticker, but ... the power connector does not match ASUS <br>  ZenBook UX31E.  I, of course, understand that not every person <br>  wants to buy two different ZenBooks and use the same charger, but, right <br>  however, it is logical to make the same chargers for the entire series of devices.  AT <br>  In this respect, Apple is far ahead with its MagSafe. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/792/e81/32e/792e8132e061ce03069aae74ce2112c6.jpg"><br><br>  Aluminum housing has not changed.  The same dimensions <br>  thickness 18 mm.  ASUS offers three color options for the UX31A - gray, light blue and pink. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ea/161/bfa/1ea161bfa4121f978fa5a17942854e33.jpg"><br><br>  What's inside? <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Intel Core i7 3517U (1.9 GHz, in TurboBoost mode - up to <br>  3 GHz), 2 cores, L3 4 MB cache, NT, <br>  TDP 17 W </td></tr><tr><td>  Chipset </td><td>  Intel HM76 Express </td></tr><tr><td>  RAM </td><td>  4 GB DDR3 1333 MHz in dual channel mode <br>  (soldered on the board) </td></tr><tr><td>  Video card </td><td>  Intel HD Graphics 4000, core frequency dynamically <br>  varies from 350 MHz to 1150 MHz </td></tr><tr><td>  Network devices </td><td>  Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, Bluetooth </td></tr><tr><td>  Storage System </td><td>  SSD: 256 Gb ADATA XM11 SATA III </td></tr><tr><td>  Integrated devices </td><td>  1.3 MP webcam, microphone </td></tr><tr><td>  Ports for connecting devices </td><td>  Two USB 3.0 ports, one micro HDMI port, <br>  one <br>  combined audio jack (headphone and microphone), one mini port <br>  VGA, SDXC / SDHC / SD / MMC card reader </td></tr><tr><td>  Display </td><td>  13.3 ‚Äù, resolution 1920 * 1080, IPS, matte </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery </td><td>  Li-Ion, 6840 mAh </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight </td><td>  1.3 kg </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98f/566/1cb/98f5661cb39ad420e9d307df77271875.jpg"><br><br>  The display is the most important difference between the UX31E and the UX31A.  In the new <br>  Ultrabook installed FullHD IPS matrix.  Matt matte.  Same <br>  just a holiday of some kind!  Despite the slight unevenness <br>  illumination (seen on the bottom edge of the screen), the impressions are exclusively <br>  positive.  ASUS applied a small trick to ensure that the font does not <br>  seemed too petty.  The default font size and icons are set. <br>  125%, and below in the screenshots you will see that it changes a little <br>  the usual kind of programs.  After installing 100% scale, icons and font <br>  took the usual form, but some users will probably <br>  uncomfortable work. <br><br>  One of the key changes is the keyboard backlight.  Below are two photos from <br>  backlight on (long exposure) and off, at night <br>  work comfortably, the light is soft, not blind.  Russian engraving <br>  Layouts are made with high quality, the letters are also highlighted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e25/43c/49a/e2543c49a31c7981ff18a6a3749740af.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dfc/519/f80/dfc519f80c109a30219a76520f35d9f1.jpg"><br>  The location of the power button has not changed, as well as the location of other "organs" of the ultrabook. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/961/e31/c8d/961e31c8db128c1650d300c41d0ce2d1.jpg"><br>  Stickers added, added ‚ÄúUltrabook.  Inspired by Intel.  Apparently <br>  to remember who is the initiator (or kopipaster) the direction of thin and <br>  light laptops. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c0c/136/938/c0c136938cbe8c2b45d9f73ec6119711.jpg"><br>  Touchpad with multitouch support (yes, three fingers down - it will turn <br>  the application in the taskbar, and three papltsy up displays <br>  "Carousel" as when pressing a combination of Win + Tab.  Touchpad dimensions <br>  preserved, it is large and comfortable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3aa/9bd/9b6/3aa9bd9b6c8b81a466d718279ef17540.jpg"><br>  The audio system is still designed with the participation of Bang &amp; Olufsen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f78/f0a/90d/f78f0a90da421ca740d79331b5af3f03.jpg"><br>  The left side of the ultrabook contains a USB 3.0 port, an audio jack and a card reader.  Nothing new, except for changing the standard USB. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cfe/72c/df6/cfe72cdf61e07b8e4e0531051d633ce3.jpg"><br>  The right side is identical to the Zenbook UX31E while maintaining the same drawback - the power connector is too close to the USB 3.0 port, which can <br>  cause difficulties when connecting dimensional USB devices. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d20/342/c68/d20342c68b01a25552f336f2042439b4.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the most interesting, huh?  Unleash the ultrabook case 15 seconds, <br>  All you need is an asterisk screwdriver.  Most of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ultrabook <br>  takes battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87f/bfb/cb8/87fbfbcb80ac026b9097184923e31f0d.jpg"><br>  The active part of the cooling system consists of one turbine, which is located on the upper right. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb8/5b3/0a5/eb85b30a5fdefdbc6bcaabed52991873.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/72d/486/0f7/72d4860f74adbf6b227ca24ef4f4e95b.jpg"><br>  SSD drive in Zenbook UX31A is different from what was used <br>  in the Zenbook UX31E.  Instead of SanDisk U100 installed ADATA XM11, which <br>  should differ for the better in their characteristics. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99a/5b7/4e3/99a5b74e32ee166ea48eb6f4ea0ee0b9.jpg"><br>  The basis of SSD is the SandForce SF-2281 controller, which has proven itself in desktop solid-state drives. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/908/58c/56e/90858c56eb56961bb87ce001f305938b.jpg"><br>  In the production of SSD used Micron memory <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e49/33f/c99/e4933fc992f1b063fd4bbbcb16b8b07e.jpg"><br>  The network card is also different from the first version of the ultrabook.  In asus <br>  Zenbook UX31A installed a model from Intel with support for Intel technology. <br>  Wireless Display.  Unfortunately, the mate that connects to <br>  I don‚Äôt have a TV set, so I personally check the work of a fashionable <br>  technology I could not. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/27b/32e/7e2/27b32e7e2fa53163f190a7029ff1c249.jpg"><br>  The battery is flat and big =) But I think where its capacity is more important - 6840 <br>  mAh, it allows you to hope for a long battery life, even <br>  given the fact that you need to feed the new processor and display FullHD. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/86a/63a/e42/86a63ae42aaeea02e90de5b515ef60af.jpg"><br>  But the very dynamics that meet the standards of Bang &amp; Olufsen <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e04/4cf/19a/e044cf19a0c5537683be0123cb358809.jpg"><br><br>  Now details about the stuffing.  Intel Core i7 3517U processor belongs <br>  family Ivy Bridge and is made by 22 nm technology.  Base frequency <br>  processor - 1900 MHz (19 * 100), in TurboBoost mode, the multiplier can <br>  rise to 30, and the frequency of one of the cores will be 3000 <br>  MHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f3a/dca/8c5/f3adca8c5bdac5adea00cb88c756971c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af9/8cc/966/af98cc9668fe8d9a012836cb30310865.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7c4/03e/699/7c403e69961bb878f24d03cabdde7dc8.png"><br>  RAM runs at 1600 MHz with CAS Latency 11. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e85/0cd/549/e850cd5497b45db16de4182f3e58a260.png"><br>  The graphics subsystem is fully supported by DirectX 11, <br>  increased number of shader processors (from 12 to 16), doubled <br>  the number (from 1 to 2) of raster blocks.  Graphic Frequencies <br>  the processor remained the same - 350 MHz in idle mode, in TurboBoost mode to <br>  1150 MHz.  In addition, the increased frequency of the RAM so <br>  It also gives an increase, because the built-in graphics uses it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a2/451/652/6a2451652b11657813d0ec0a15644123.png"><br>  Information about the SSD drive: temperature monitoring is supported, the data interface is SATA III or SATA 6 Gb / s <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e8f/b67/578/e8fb675786c78499d8c3dcff0ad831ed.png"><br><br>  The test part of the review will start with a comprehensive assessment of Windows 7 - the indicator is 5.9 - the highest rating of those tested before <br>  ultrabooks.  A weak point, oddly enough, RAM. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/311/366/42b/31136642bd08b7d7d1afbd50a6dc5aed.png"><br>  New generation memory controller and increased frequency of operation <br>  RAM do their "black" thing.  Reading from memory <br>  slightly falls short of 17,000 MB / s, while in ultrabooks <br>  Intel Sandy Bridge and 13,000 were considered a good indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/681/825/650/681825650f94180e454468ddf8cefacc.png"><br><br>  The SSD test CrystalDiskMark draws attention to the high result <br>  when reading or writing small blocks.  Obviously solid state drive <br>  ADATA in the UX31A is significantly faster than SanDisk in the UX31E. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aad/bf8/d0f/aadbf8d0f8a5f4cd96c3d2e0755e7928.png"><br><br>  The results of PC Mark Vantage and PC Mark 7 are staggering.  Fast <br>  SSD gives a huge increase in the total score and the new Zenbook <br>  becomes the leader of (my personal) ultrabooks rating. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ae/f4a/a54/1aef4aa54b75fcaebf3dac0da1a42429.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ff/b4b/a1d/2ffb4ba1de3476627d90cbd4d3290827.png"><br>  Battery life is not the strongest point. <br>  Zenbook.  The result is not bad, but not a record one.  In office mode <br>  (typing in Word) it lasted about 8 hours at 30% brightness <br>  screen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f7/d61/226/7f7d61226d44e45e66e901fb89dd313f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b77/294/43d/b7729443dd5dcf36711b0115b385ed2a.png"><br><br>  Final thoughts. <br>  ASUS is again on top, again almost everything is perfect.  The cost is probably <br>  write only warming up the processor to 72 degrees (although maybe I <br>  carping) and uneven illumination.  There are significantly more advantages - firstly, this is a super-fast SSD drive, and secondly, two USB 3.0 ports, <br>  thirdly, the new fast processor and the new fast integrated <br>  graphics.  Keyboard backlighting, Intel Wireless Display support - this is <br>  also undeniable positive qualities.  Well, finally the price.  Similar <br>  MacBook Air will cost more than 60,000 rubles, and ASUS Zenbook UX31A costs <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/335263/">52,800 rubles</a> , <br>  that is, almost 10 kiloruble cheaper.  Of course, there is no cover <br>  apples, and inside the lion, but do they all need?  Dear ultrabooks all <br>  more popular, and if at CeBit I looked like a black sheep with a single <br>  Zenbook among MacBook Air and Pro, now the percentage <br>  ultrabook among colleagues is 25 to 75, so far in favor of products <br>  Apple, but there will be more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149232/</a></p>
