      Many businesses and professionals have a commitment to Microsoft products, but most of them are due to economic necessity and the lack of alternatives.  However, do not confuse economic need with customer loyalty.  Very few users are committed to Microsoft. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Customer loyalty can be invaluable for a company, and Apple is justly known for its passion for design and design at all levels.  Every aspect of Apple's corporate identity, its products and marketing campaigns is imbued with a wonderful sense of design.  The awards and honors given by Apple are too numerous to be counted, but just look at its programs, devices, packaging and documentation, and even just the parties that the company rolls up at Microsoft World, and it becomes clear that the design and design are close. according to her spirit <br><br>  This commitment to design and attention to detail interactions created for Apple bordering on fanaticism ‚Äî and often turning into it ‚Äî customer loyalty.  Macintosh users are the most loyal software owners of all products.  No other product or manufacturer inspires personal dedication like Apple.  The company's customers stick Apple logos on cars, order special license plates for their cars, wear Apple t-shirts, show their belonging to the Apple spirit.  They extol the virtues of Macs to anyone who is willing to listen.  In most situations, a little-known Wintel computer will satisfy all human needs better, cheaper, and faster than a Mac, but the Macintosh always remains the chosen computer.  At a recent design conference, only one speaker used a Wintel machine instead of a Macintosh, and she apologized very much to the audience for her ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù - after all, she betrayed a computer, the only one worthy of having at least the rudiments of a sense of harmony. <br><br>  Apple's technological prowess is worthy, but devoid of greatness.  In terms of Apple‚Äôs technical potential in terms of innovation, Microsoft is no better. <br><br>  It took Apple twelve years to lose the leadership that Novell (there was such a mega-company) lost in just one year.  Few Apple problems were related to external factors.  On the contrary, this company has suffered from the amazing diversity of the problems it has created itself.  For example, in the mid-eighties, Steve Jobs, the founder and main enthusiast of the company, was expelled and replaced by a non-computer-related and non-alcoholic drink manager who repeatedly made unfit business decisions.  Inflated product prices, poor marketing, a viciously scornful attitude towards third-party software developers, and, among other things, Mac remained a closed platform;  The latter strategy is widely referred to as the reason for the overthrow of other platforms that dominated the market (such as VMS, MVS and OS / 2). <br><br>  All these blunders would easily have destroyed an ordinary company, but the design and design that made the Mac attractive, earned Apple an unprecedented customer loyalty.  Macs didn‚Äôt satisfy users ‚Äôneeds better than computers running Windows, and in many cases even worse, but meeting needs isn‚Äôt a vital part of market success. <br><br>  After prolonged criticism of management, obvious financial losses, after the creation of mediocre products, after all the billions thrown into empty research, after losing two-thirds of the market, no other company still has a more loyal army of customers.  This gives Apple a huge business advantage.  Many of these advantages are difficult to measure, and none of them are reflected in the company's financial balance sheets, but they are just as tangible and valuable to shareholders as a check for dividends. <br><br>  Design-based dedication makes Macs fans turn a blind eye to the many benefits of products from other manufacturers.  The reluctance of fans to use other products gives Apple time to react to the innovations of its competitors.  Customer loyalty gives Apple the ability to withstand surprises from technological breakthroughs.  The fall of Novell began at the very moment when the competitor ‚Äî we are talking about Microsoft ‚Äî offered a viable networking product.  Novell‚Äôs gigantic market share was unable to counter the onslaught of market forces.  On the other hand, Apple, who has never owned more than 15% of the computer market, stubbornly resists the onslaught of many competing computers, powerful and cheap. <br><br>  Apple is a company whose products attract users.  Apple's commitment to design has allowed the company to survive the average quality of technology and destructive business conduct. <br><br>  Consider Novell designing, the company could overcome the consequences of weak marketing moves.  If MisroSoft ever wakes up and realizes the importance of designing interaction, competitors will only have to lay down their arms and go home.  Apple, in self-destruction, has become like a grunge rock star; however, by continuing to regain its former shape, it may once again become a viable company. <br><br>  - The history of Microsoft is simple.  The company's products are technically complete, but rarely advanced.  Microsoft prefers to stand on the shoulders of giants who have already done research and development13.  However, there is no doubt that Bill Gates is one of the most talented businessmen of his generation, or even a century.  He has an amazing ability to extract success from virtually every enterprise, despite the obstacles that arise. <br><br>  Microsoft doesn‚Äôt or almost doesn‚Äôt design, and its products are known to make users feel stupid.  They are also known for a large number of functions. <br><br>  Many business enterprises and professionals have a commitment to Microsoft products, but for the most part due to economic necessity and the lack of alternatives.  Few other companies are able to provide as complete a solution as Microsoft.  However, do not confuse economic need with customer loyalty.  Very few users are committed to Microsoft. <br><br>  Microsoft is a company with some potential and amazing vitality.  Microsoft has adequate technology and great business, which in the short term compensates for the lack of design. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72645/</a></p>
