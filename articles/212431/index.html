We were pleasantly surprised by the activity of the participants who asked interesting, non-trivial questions.  The full webinar entry is at the end of this post.  By the way, we remind you that the application campaign of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/innopolis_university/blog/210994/"><b>competition</b></a> for study at the Bachelor of Innopolis University is in full swing, hurry up to register.

      Today we want to talk about our next webinar - it will be held <b>on February 18 at 18:00</b> (Moscow Time) and will be devoted to Artificial Cognitive Systems.  Registration is <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3022850291252298754"><b>here</b></a> .  He will be hosted by <b>David Vernon, a</b> visiting professor at Innopolis University.  Nobody will tell about himself better than the author himself, so we decided to post here a translation of the material from his personal website, in which Professor Vernon talks about the field of his scientific activity.  So, a word to our teacher: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Although most of my work in the last 28 years was related to computer vision and AI, starting with my dissertation work on robotics and robot vision, I began to study cognitive and autonomous systems immediately after my Ph.D.  in 1985.  The work of Maturana and Varela and their principles of autopoiesis and operational closure had a significant impact on my thinking, as well as the philosophy of the phenomenology of Husserl and Heidegger.  Unfortunately, despite the many attempts to develop and build an autopoietic system, the next 20 years brought very little in confirming empirical scientific results.  I published several scientific papers on this topic, but they did not satisfy me as an engineer, and did not impress the scientific community, which was still ‚Äúcaptivated‚Äù by the hypotheses of the Newell and Simon physical systems, and the accompanying approach to knowledge and artificial intelligence.  Therefore, pragmatism prevailed in me (but only for a while), and I focused my attention on computer vision.  This activity brought results in the form of a new Fourier <a href="http://www.vernon.eu/publications/01_Vernon_Fourier_Vision.pdf">technology</a> for recognition and segmentation of fuzzy images. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ada/e67/5bc/adae675bc2f222956a848cddbb2b34ec.jpg"><br><br>  During this period of time, a quarter of a century long, however, I have observed a slow but inevitable change in the thinking of the scientific community.  In recent years, it has become obvious that the theory of knowledge is very closely intertwined with the physical structure of the body and its interaction with the external environment.  Intellect and thought processes are deeply dependent on the structure of the body, motor functions and especially the skills of manipulation, as well as on the elasticity of the muscles and the morphology of the retina and sensory system.  The human body and its actions play no less a role in cognition than neural processes, and human intelligence develops through interaction with environmental objects and other people. <br><br>  This new view on AI is a fundamental shift in the transition from functionalism and dualism of cognitiveness and ‚Äúclassical‚Äù artificial intelligence to an alternative concept that again emphasizes the superiority of materialism, development and interaction in cognitive systems.  These models are mainly based on the theory of dynamic systems, complex forms of connectivity and self-organization.  All these concepts resonate strongly with the early works of Maturana and Varela.  In summary, these concepts are known as <b>enative systems</b> . <br><br>  Enactive systems are based on five central principles - materialism, experience, emergence, autonomy, and judgment.  Inactive approaches organically and physically play a key role in cognition.  Consequently, it is impossible not to take into account ontogenesis as an objective given, since the experience of the observer determines his cognitive understanding of the world in which he exists. <br><br>  One of the most tangible consequences of this philosophy change is the implementation of interdisciplinary research that combines neuroscience, developmental psychology, epigenetic robotics, the theory of complex systems, philosophy, and, of course, computer science.  The European Commission actively supports and stimulates the development of this new science.  I can say that I am lucky to take part in two Commission projects - RobotCub and euCognition. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBHsWTqSCHc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhZYVtMaIAUSga3-F9hO6uahJwnZw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  RobotCub is engaged in the creation of a cognitive humanoid robot - iCub, the main goal of this project is to create an open platform and research in the field of enative cognition.  I am engaged in this project creating the cognitive architecture of this robot.  I hope that finally, 25 years later, today we have the tools and embryonic theories that will enable us to realize a truly active cognitive system that would pay tribute to the ideas of the pioneer of this science - Francisco Varela. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4mbYz0JUxM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhheFULJKuT-H8Oz-PE57CirE_SKHw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Artificial Intelligence webinar recording on February 11, 2014 (duration - 39 minutes) <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gSq0BNt3c6o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjh6daOXy6G0T2Q0s-nDLGn2ZijNw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Decryption of questions and answers during the webinar: <a href="http://vk.com/topic-56385969_29710758">vk.com/topic-56385969_29710758</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212431/</a></p>
