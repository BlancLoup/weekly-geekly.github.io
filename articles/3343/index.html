    </font></i>  <i><font>(2) Achieving social consensus is much harder for this, and blogging can help.</font></i>  <i><font>As a result, we (for the first time in history since Iceland, Athens, and Novgorod) will have real democratic rule, instead of a semi-feudal and brainless oligarchy, which represents democracy, but follows only Parkinson's laws and negative selection, as a result of which all positions are filled without exception ignoramuses and freaks, the number of expanding to infinity.</font></i> <i><font><br><br></font></i>  <i><font>(3) This scenario (conditionally ‚Äúblog revolution‚Äù: total transparency of all government decisions, down to the smallest, replacement of bureaucrats with elected volunteers, and representative democracy ‚Äî direct, forum-type) arises from the early 1990s, and all this time becomes closer and closer.</font></i>  <i><font>And as a result, not only bureaucrats will be abolished, but all structures of a similar nature, primarily banks and international corporations;</font></i>  <i><font>that is, it will be the end not only of the bureaucracy, but also of capitalism.</font></i>  <i><font>By the time such a thing can be realized entirely (in 20-30 years), <u>tangible property will be 95-99% repressed by ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù,</u> which can be canceled with a stroke of a pen.</font></i> <i><font><br><br></font></i>  <i><font>(4) This will be realized, and as a result, the institution of ‚Äúmoney‚Äù and ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù will be abolished, and people will be happy to engage in free creativity, raise children and engage in pedagogy and medicine not because of a stick, but because these are interesting and enjoyable.</font></i> <i><font><br><br></font></i>  <i><font>(5) But, of course, there are few chances for the peaceful implementation of this scenario - too serious forces are interested in continuing the status quo.</font></i>  <i><font>This, in fact, explains the attempts to buy bloggers and destroy the blogosphere (the purchase of Livejournal.com by 6 Apart, and the Russian SUP sector is not at all unique here).</font></i> <i><font><br><br></font></i>  <i><font>(6) Probably no one specifically made such a decision - ‚Äúthey say, bloggers threaten us with direct democracy and communism, so let's buy them all and pay them money to act as Petrosyan and Parker, and shut up the rest‚Äù.</font></i> <i><font><br><br></font></i>  <i><font>(7) But the system of social relations, like any quasi-stationary system, responds to any process that changes the status quo by trying to extinguish and destroy this process.</font></i>  <i><font>Therefore, <u>we should expect repression against bloggers and blogging as a free and independent movement and be ready for them</u> .</font></i>  <i><font><strong>In Russia, they have already begun - several people are judged for speaking on the forums, Blotoma Stomakhin was imprisoned for five years and his back was broken.</strong></font></i> <i><font><br><br></font></i>  <i><font>(8) The most reasonable thing here would be to do something with the functionality of livejournal.com, but distributed and duplicated many times over the Network in order to avoid repression.</font></i>  <i><font>We developed something similar, in terms of technical tasks and documentation, and not only we, I think, the idea is in the air.</font></i>  <i><font>The revolution is inevitable.</font></i> <br><br>  And that's what I think myself ... <br>  (1) And where does equality come from?  In an intellectual environment it is much harder to measure "who you are."  In the material world, you can conditionally measure a lot of money with money - Vasya has a million, and Petya has a half yard, which means Petya is better and Vasya is stupid.  And then Vasya has a blog, and Petya has a blog, and they read both, and comment - and how to measure? <br>  But about the mechanism - I completely agree.  It's time to replace the old rusty ‚Äúmonkey hierarchy,‚Äù proudly called democracy, with a normal problem-solving device, and Network 2.0 is a good tool for this.  And this is the first step on the way to the grid-society, because without effective distribution of intellectual resources, humanity can manage to destroy itself before it reaches the necessary concentration of nanotechnologies needed for the considered grid-society model. <br><br>  (3) I already wrote about this :) under the impression of Bard.  This is exactly the way the next stage seems to be, and all <strong>the</strong> greater virtualization of money is one of the indirect symptoms of this process. <br><br>  (4) The generation in which there will be at least 50% of such people must still be raised ... <br><br>  (7) Therefore, it is time to look for effective protection mechanisms.  Social networks, in principle, can be tailored to help ensure the safety of prominent figures of the blogosphere. <br><br>  (8) It's not about distribution, it's enough.  The fact is that in the event of ‚Äúhitting‚Äù bloggers could act in <strong>real life</strong> : connect their ties with political figures of all levels, capital, organize some actions, right up to strikes and acts of civil disobedience.  Revolution means revolution. <br>  And just blogging around bastards - will not be enough ... <br><br>  Whether still will be, oh-oh-oh ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3343/</a></p>
