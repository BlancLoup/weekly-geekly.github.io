  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to write an effective commercial offer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once again, I sat down to write a typical commercial offer for a new service of our company, and I caught myself thinking that it would be nice to have some brief manual for myself on this topic.  Since I am writing commercial offers as needed (which is quite rare), my skills are lost, and each time I have to rummage through my <s>notes of crazy</s> posts on this topic and every time re-invent the bicycle.  And so that my works are not wasted in vain, I decided to create an article for Habr out of all this. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We will immediately agree that we will write a commercial offer (hereinafter referred to as <b>KP</b> ) not for an IT person (they are too harsh to read a KP), but for the average owner of a small or medium business, because it is the business owner who will make the final decision on your offer. <br><br>  We also agree that as an example, we are talking about KP on the development of the site.  Although described below can be safely applied to any commercial offer. <br><habracut><br>  <b>1. Start writing a CP with information gathering.</b> <br>  Brainstorm (yourself or with a companion).  Create a text file and <s>copy</s> write there any ideas for text KP: phrases, headings, sentences, your benefits, your actions.  All completely, until the ideas run out.  Next, make the structure of your future KP.

      <b>2. KP header should clearly show the client what his problem will solve your offer.</b> <br>  Marketers have such a favorite example - "the <i>buyer needs not a drill, but holes</i> ."  Also, your client does not need a website, he needs to increase sales, product presentation, brand promotion. <br><br>  <b>3. Remove your company description altogether</b> <br>  All these dull texts like "we were educated then ....", "we are a dynamically developing company ...," no one needs!  Nobody reads them, believe me!  The client is not interested in who you are, he is interested in how effectively you can solve his problem here and now. <br><br>  <b>4. Avoid in the text of the words We, Us, Our</b> <br>  It is rather difficult to write such a text, but if it works, it becomes a completely different shade.  Often use the words you, your, you. <br><br>  <b>5. Speak the same language with the client.</b> <br>  Remove all technical terms from your text.  The client cares little that you can sculpt on CSS3 and HTML5, that you work with the latest version of PHP and MySQL, etc ... Not only is the client not interested in it at all, he also has a completely correct opinion that you are fixated only on technology, not on solving his problem. <br><br>  <b>6. Find arguments clear to the client.</b> <br>  As an example, it is possible to paint for a long time the advantages of a CMS, and you can simply say that this CMS has a website for such and such a very large corporation, and this will be a very weighty argument that everyone can understand without explanation. <br><br>  <b>7. Do not write a lot of text, the client needs only the essence</b> <br>  Make simple, short sentences.  Do not use complex turns.  Each paragraph must contain no more than three lines.  The contract should go no more than three paragraphs of the text. <br><br>  <b>8. Add feedback from customers</b> <br>  If you have reviews, be sure to add the most juicy quotes from several.  But it is obligatory with the indication of the company that compiled the review, the full name and the position of its signer. <br><br>  <b>9. The total size of the manual should not exceed 2 pages.</b> <br>  Imagine the working day of a small business manager who has a lot of his current problems and questions, and then a huge KP with a bunch of text falls on his email.  At best, he quickly flips through it only in search of a price, at worst - it will simply close upon seeing its size. <br>  KP should be short and concise.  The living text should eventually be no more than 1 - 1.5 pages, so that there is room for the designer to design. <br><br>  <b>10. Do not stint on the design of KP</b> <br>  KP is a simple text, with good typography, this is not bad.  But if you order the design of a commercial offer from a professional, it will be noticeably stand out among all the others. <br><br>  And the last.  Do not try to make a CP in a day.  With such ideas you should always sleep, so that the next day you can still reconsider with a fresh head. <br><ul><li>  on the first day - collect material for KP, make a structure, start writing KP, </li><li>  on the second day - try to add all KP, </li><li>  on the third day - make the final edit, show the controls to your friends, make final adjustments and send to the designer for decoration. </li></ul></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150103/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150103/</a></p>
