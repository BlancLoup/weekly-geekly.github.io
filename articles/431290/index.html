      Nature lover Eric Thulin founded Thule in Sweden in 1942.  He began by selling his fishing gear of his own invention.  Half a century later, his brainchild continues to create practical and useful things.  For example, recognizable backpacks with a distinctive strict design and a large number of convenient pockets. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WkLrWUgv3DA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  A typical Thule backpack is a station wagon that is equally good in everything, but still has a specific purpose.  The <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/ryukzak-thule-crossover-tcbp-317-25-litrov/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblackfriday1802">Thule Crossover TCBP-317</a> model, for example, is a city backpack for carrying a laptop and gadgets.  There is enough space in it to pack for a short trip - the volume of TCBP-317 is 25 liters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/od/zz/y5/odzzy5qiax7sibazc7lsvhnl1qu.jpeg"><br><br>  Most importantly, everything you need will be laid out "on the shelves."  In the spacious main compartment is a reinforced compartment for a 15-inch laptop and a pocket for a tablet.  Auxiliary compartment is designed as an organizer for things with pockets and elastic bands for pens.  This will fit small gadgets, charging, paper and other small things.  At the top of the backpack is a shockproof SafeZone compartment for glasses and a smartphone, and a vertically opening pocket is located under it.  On both sides - bottle / umbrella holders.  The back of the backpack is breathable, as are the straps;  the latter has an adjustable chest strap.  Fabric durable, waterproof, unobtrusive colors: gray in a white dot. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/brands/diy-house/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblackfriday1802">Interior designers DIY House - 30% discount</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/68/om/v7/68omv7twdieag1nzenxone12nsg.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/madrobots/blog/416721/">On one of these designers, we wrote a detailed review with photos of the assembly and the finished result</a> .  In brief, we recall that the series DIY House consists of kits for assembling rumboks.  Rumbox - respectable art to create miniature copies of interiors.  While some color spacemarines paint, others build realistic flowers and furniture from tiny pieces of paper and fabric. <br><br>  Each DIY House kit has almost everything you need: paper, fabric, wood, glue, paint, wire, tiny blanks for smaller household items.  Scissors will need your own, like a knife, but detailed instructions in Russian are attached to the kit.  Making a thumbnail is both easier and more difficult than it seems.  The process is pleasant and relaxing, the Madrobots team guarantees this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0z/ig/f7/0zigf7-8nxj8vlpvlc9itpm66ie.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/diy-house-kathy-s-green-house/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblackfriday1802"><i>Set DIY House Orangery</i></a> <br><br>  The final touch is a working rumboksa backlight.  All elements for its assembly are also included in the kit, you will only have to "hold the light."  Consider that DIY House designers have an age limit and are suitable for collectors from 14 years old.  Tiny elements and silicate glue for young children is not a toy. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/igarden-led/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblackfriday1802">Smart garden iGarden LED - 20% discount</a> </h3><br>  Have you ever tried to grow something fastidious and edible on your own window?  With iGarden LED smart garden, any of your gardening experiments are doomed to success, even if you had previously dried cacti. <br><br>  The gadget is a hydroponic with automatic backlight.  Plants are planted in two containers with a special substrate - vermiculite.  Containers are placed in a basic tank of water, and an LED lamp of artificial light is attached to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bq/gb/5v/bqgb5vv42ig1_uhwym62nnpvl_4.jpeg"><br><br>  It would seem that iGarden LED is a simple system, but it solves many problems with residential gardening at once.  The backlight is installed on a convenient stand, its height is adjustable.  Water is supplied to the roots from the reservoir, if you need to add a little more - the garden will warn.  Since there is no land, there is no dirt.  You can plant lettuce, greens, strawberries, tomatoes, decorative crops.  As a rule, in hydroponics and with lighting, plants grow and develop quickly. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-issa-2/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblackfriday1802">Foreo ISSA 2 Electric Toothbrush - 20% discount on promo code BF2018</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/rk/pq/pdrkpqqurryfducc4rfs1laxeyo.jpeg"><br><br>  Sonic toothbrush ISSA 2 developed by the Swedish company Foreo differs from competing products in its rare ‚Äúvitality‚Äù.  The charge of its batteries lasts for a year of daily cleaning.  That is, with another brush, you need to carefully monitor the battery so that the gadget is not discharged at the most inopportune moment (when you overslept the alarm and hurriedly going to work).  ISSA 2 is enough to put on charge once a year for one hour.  Agree, these are two big differences. <br><br>  The brush speed is 11,000 pulsations per minute.  There are 16 switchable intensity levels and a timer with a cleaning program for each quarter of the oral cavity.  On the back of the head there is a tongue scraper. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UiJwvQk31UQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The head and body of the brush are made of branded non-porous silicone, its main advantage is that due to the absence of pores, the brush does not turn into a hotbed of bacteria and other unpleasant organisms.  It can be washed once and not worry about hygiene.  In addition to silicone, a PBT polymer was used for the head, from which the central bristles were made.  Silicone bristles on the edges do not hurt the gums, the polymer in the center gently removes plaque and does not scratch the enamel.  The service life of such a head reaches 6 months. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/bose-quietcomfort-35-ii/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblackfriday1802">Wireless headphones Bose QuietComfort 35 (QC35) II - 20% discount</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fd/ce/4w/fdce4w5vbjosveu-ji6d-d11o1c.jpeg"><br><br>  Maybe not everyone listened to Bose headphones, but many have heard about them, and especially about the proprietary active noise reduction system.  The system generates white noise and shields the user from unwanted sounds on the street and in the premises.  Traffic noise, loud music and conversations are well blocked.  However, the traditional neighbor drill has every chance to break through the barrier.  Alas, this is not magic.  This is a technique. <br><br>  Model Bose QuietComfort 35 II suppresses extraneous sounds simultaneously using active and passive noise reduction, that is, the material and shape of the headphones.  The cups are oval and completely cover the ears, the ear cushions are soft, the whole design fits comfortably on most of the heads. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ko/xo/iq/koxoiqasay2abnfza-nzllnzt1c.jpeg"><br><br>  The frequency range of the QC35 II is 20‚Äì20 000 Hz, the bass is strongly pronounced, the mid frequencies sound good.  It is worth noting that active noise cancellation does affect the quality of the music being played, but only audiophiles usually notice this. <br><br>  Headphones work wirelessly, connecting to the sound source via Bluetooth, and wired, for which a detachable cable is provided.  The battery lasts for 20 hours of operation QC35 II.  In addition, the model supports work with the voice assistant Google Assistant. <br><br>  Black Friday week in Madrobots will last until November 30th inclusive.
