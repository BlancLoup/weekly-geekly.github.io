  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Search engines - and what would you like?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Search engines today are known to all.  Many inexperienced users believe that search engines are the Internet, because the entrance to the network begins through them.  Recently, I faced the task of finding very interesting information.  The problem was that I didn‚Äôt know exactly what I was looking for.  About this and what search engine would help me ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Today, search engines are built in such a way that they try to answer the question posed by the user.  For example, "who first flew into space?".  This is a very specific question that has a very specific answer.  I believe that there are search engines for such a query today.  Search engines successfully solve problems with the purchase of a mobile or laptop, search for some office for a contract.  You can even find recipes.  The main thing to know what to look for.  I think this is the main thing. <br><br>  But what if I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm specifically looking for.  I had such a problem when looking for information to study the topic of project management.  "Basic information" on the network is enough.  It is enough to read a couple of books and a couple of years of experience so that most of this information is not entirely interesting.  In principle, I am sure that on many topics ‚Äúbasic information‚Äù is in bulk, but how to select from this information that which has value.

      By the value of information, I understand the <b>brevity and clarity of</b> presentation.  Unfortunately, on my topic, I found only a lot of duplicates, which described on several pages what is described in the wiki in a few sentences. <br><br>  The only way I can see is the creation of a certain search engine that would satisfy such requests.  I don‚Äôt want to describe how to create it and make hints for algorithms, because  I practically don‚Äôt understand the search algorithms.  I'll tell you what I would like from such a search engine. <br><br>  <b>First,</b> I want the search engine to define various sub-topics on request.  For example, if I am looking for ‚Äúproject management‚Äù, then this is ‚Äútraining,‚Äù ‚Äúservice,‚Äù ‚Äútheory and practice.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Secondly,</b> I want the search engine to be able to filter these sub-topics.  Only it is not stop words, namely filtering topics.  For ‚Äútraining‚Äù and ‚Äútraining‚Äù are the same thing, if I am looking for ‚Äúservices‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Thirdly,</b> I want the search engine to determine the theme of the page in a "broad" sense.  For example, the page may not have the ‚Äúknitting‚Äù keyword indicated, but the entire page may be written with a description of the hooks.  This is probably one of the most important "want", because  This is what allows us to expand the field of knowledge, to get to the knowledge of which we do not know.  Or at least come across questions that will allow us to look further. <br><br>  It is a pity that the commercial use of such a machine is difficult, in my opinion.  But surely such a search engine would be popular in academic circles.  About what system would you like to write in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72348/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72348/</a></p>
