      For a long time he used a wired mouse, but firstly, he was tired of the ever-dangling wire, and secondly she ordered to live long.  And I decided to find a high-quality and reliable wireless mouse in place of the late ‚Äúbeast‚Äù.  I chose Logitech because I had long been trusted by this firm in the field of controllers.  After a week of searching and reading the thematic reviews, as well as intelligence on friends, I decided to buy, and the blue V470 migrated from the store to my backpack. <br>  The actual selection criteria for the mouse were as follows: <br><br>  1. Bluetooth (because the laptop has some USB ports). <br>  2. High accuracy (sometimes photoshop). <br>  3. Long battery life. <br>  4. Reliability. <br>  5. Acceptable work on different surfaces. <br>  6. Average size. <br><br><h5>  Appearance </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52c/78d/f85/52c78df85d9c126f338de4cce6e29db0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Logitech V470 is a medium-sized (blue or white) animal, with a smooth, lacquered upper part and rough sides for easy grip.  Buttons - standard: Left click, right click, wheel (scroll: forward, back. Button: right, left and click).  I must admit that when I opened the package, I was somewhat disappointed with the upper, glossy surface, because I was completely sure that in a month it would scrape away and scratch.  But at the moment, it has served me for about a year, and as you can see, it looks like new. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed5/39c/6b7/ed539c6b7352e6375acbb6ea61caefd1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A couple of times fell from a height of about a meter, like no damage. <br><br>  On the belly, button connections, on / off.  and a laser sensor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c40/884/bef/c40884beff064bce81a46bc218f16b2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Characteristics and equipment </h5><br>  OS: Windows¬Æ XP, Windows Vista¬Æ, Windows¬Æ 7, Mac OS¬Æ X (10.4 or later), Linux. <br>  System requirements: Computer equipped with Bluetooth¬Æ wireless technology <br>  Warranty: Manufacturer's warranty 3 years <br>  Contents of delivery: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Logitech¬Æ V470 Cordless Laser Mouse Wireless Mouse <br>  ‚Ä¢ Logitech¬Æ SetPoint ‚Ñ¢ software CD <br>  ‚Ä¢ Protective case <br>  ‚Ä¢ Installation Guide <br>  ‚Ä¢ 2 AA batteries <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c1/69d/392/9c169d392f3738c00d28c209a9d99ebc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Optical sensor resolution: +100500 dpi (True, Logitech is silent about this, and numbers from 1000 to 1600dpi appear on various resources). <br>  Battery life: 4 months. <br>  Technologies: Bluetooth¬Æ wireless technology, Smart power management, Side-to-side scrolling plus zoom, Laser tracking. <br><br><h5>  Usability </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af9/a37/043/af9a370434914e0070977c9e2ad904e0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  During use, this mouse had to see a lot of different surfaces from the concrete bench and to the duvet.  And in most cases, she coped on 5, perhaps, except for glass, tracing paper and surfaces of high hairiness (woolen blanket <s>, hairy leg, dog</s> ). <br>  The battery life is simple - a song, on average, good batteries last for 4 months and this is with daily use, usually about 5-7 hours (though I don't turn it off when I don‚Äôt use it).  When the charge is running out, the blue indicator starts flashing and in this state the mouse can work for another week. <br>  The movement of the buttons is light and not deep, the wheel is moderately tight, I do not use the right-left buttons.  The mouse <s>slides</s> well, <s>especially on sandpaper nuke</s> in the hand lies comfortably. <br>  Connecting to a computer is painless, there are no problems in Linux ubuntu and Windows 7 / XP, but when you connect to a new operating system, synchronization disappears, so fans will switch from one operating system to another, will be a bit annoying.  The process itself is very simple, click on the ‚Äúconnect‚Äù button on the mouse and find it via Bluetooth, talk to connect and everything works.  There is a special utility Set Point from Logitech, but I personally do not see the point in it, and so the mouse works with a bang.  When the OS starts, the connection occurs on the fly, there have never been any spontaneous outages.  When copying files via Bluetooth, the cursor significantly slows down, but I have never sent files larger than 20 MB and I don‚Äôt see any problems. <br><br><h5>  Pros &amp; Cons </h5><br><h6>  Pros </h6><br>  + No USB required. <br>  + Long work from one set of batteries. <br>  + Acceptable price.  (1335 rubles on <a href="">Yandex</a> or about $ 40 on <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/i.html%3F_nkw%3Dv470%2Bmouse%26_sacat%3D0%26_stpos%3D%26gbr%3D1%26_odkw%3Dv470%26_osacat%3D0%26_trksid%3Dp3286.c0.m270.l1313">eBay</a> , beware of fakes). <br>  + Relatively high positioning accuracy. <br><br><h6>  Cons </h6><br>  - The difficulty of using the mouse when transferring files via Bluetooth. <br>  - It remembers only the last connected device or OS (when switching to another OS, it requires reconnection). <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Honestly, I didn‚Äôt particularly plan to write a review of the Logitech V470 mouse until it was time to get a wireless mouse for my wife.  At first I tried to find something new, we looked at several models in the stores, I liked Razer Orochi Black Bluetooth, but my wife rejected ‚Äúthis monster‚Äù and didn‚Äôt feed the horse.  Having rummaged in the Internet, she also did not find anything.  As a result, after working half a day with my mouse, my wife said that she wanted the same one; in fact, it turned out that now we have two Logitech blue-toothed rodents living in our house. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a48/fed/370/a48fed370a4ff89e83ecd5c504239c28.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I do not presume to say that this mouse is the ‚Äúcoolest‚Äù, but in my opinion, it has proven itself quite well and for this money it‚Äôs better not to find anything.  I really hope that this post will be useful to someone <s>and will not mark the beginning of a ‚Äúthird world war‚Äù</s> . <br>  If you have questions I will answer with pleasure. <br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116885/</a></p>
