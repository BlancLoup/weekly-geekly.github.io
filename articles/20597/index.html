      It was a moonless and warm summer night. <br><br>  KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  Today I was lucky. <br>  Under the cover of night, I dug up potatoes from neighbors. <br><br>  V_V writes ... <br><br>  But when I sneaked with this burden (a bucket of potatoes - this is not you fucking bad) among the thicket of onions from behind the barn, you heard some sounds like steps <br><br>  KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  they reminded me of sounds from childhood, these steps were very familiar to me ... <br>  when I was sitting in the kitchen and brazenly vyzhiral condensed milk from the jar, my father came, my innocent vzgyad on his father's palm ... and then the memory was cut off ... <br>  Do I really dig potatoes in my father's garden ?! <br><br>  December 4, 2007 5:30 <br>  Blogger HomelessIn writes ... <br><br>  the deaf sound of the shot took me by surprise <br><br>  December 4, 2007 5:30 <br>  Blogger HomelessIn writes ... <br><br>  I was lying in a big sticky puddle ... and my whole life flashed before my eyes ... <br><br>  December 4, 2007 5:33 am <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  yes ... there was such a childhood!  My father did not like it when I ate condensed milk.  and each time after a deaf one, like a shot of my father‚Äôs blow on my calf, I lay with a pool of sticky condensed milk ... but it was so fucking awesome ... I and the condensed milk merged into one whole! <br><br>  December 4, 2007 5:52 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  But now it was completely different.  It felt to my taste that the ‚Äústicky slurry‚Äù was obviously not condensed milk, what happened to me and where I am and who am I ??? <br><br>  December 4, 2007 5:59 <br>  Blogger HomelessIn writes ... <br><br>  this time it was all real ... <br><br>  I felt a dull pain in my whole body ... the light was unbearably cutting my eyes ... <br>  forces remained less and less ... <br><br>  and the last thing I saw was this inhuman face in a spacesuit bending over me ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  December 4, 2007 6:02 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  It was the owner of the garden with a bucket on his head.  A bucket like a spacesuit, a spacesuit like a bucket ... but I was not amused ... <br><br>  December 4, 2007 6:04 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  A thought flashed through my head: ‚ÄúFuck a bucket on his head‚Äù? <br><br>  December 4, 2007 6:36 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  Probably he put a bucket on so that the aliens could not read his thoughts ... "somewhere there should have been a corn field nearby ..." - flashed through my head (the film "Signs") <br><br>  December 4, 2007 6:43 <br>  Blogger Lexx writes ... <br><br>  This bucket was an attribute for scaring and misleading such thieves of potatoes.  After the stories of the young thief about the aliens in the garden with a bucket on his head, he will obviously be taken to a psychiatric hospital.  A suspicion will not fall on the backyard garden. <br><br>  December 4, 2007 6:45 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  The thief himself having closed his eyes firmly promised: <br>  - "I will definitely come back here for corn." <br>  But now it was necessary to make a lightning decision!  What to do?! <br>  Having groped the stolen carto in the bag, Baton abrupt movement poked the sharp edge of the carrot into the grandfather's eye in the spacesuit ... <br>  I had to run ... <br><br>  December 4, 2007 6:53 <br>  Blogger Lexx writes ... <br><br>  The most powerful kartoha pierced his grandfather‚Äôs eye with a bucket on his head.  Grandfather was in shock.  This moment is a young thief and decided to take advantage.  He quickly got up, threw the bag over his shoulders and ran away.  He still did not leave the thought of the sweet corn. <br><br>  December 4, 2007 7:01 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  Rising to his feet, Baton felt a sharp pain in his back ... Something pricked, ached and it was very difficult to move. <br>  ‚ÄúDeaf shot ...‚Äù Yes, yes.  it was a deaf shot he heard before he was on the ground. <br>  Wrapping his head back and staring at his back in the darkness, Baton saw ... Seeing the sharp potato that pierced the spacesuit and Granddaddy's eye in the bag was not the only one ... Belarusian grandfather-breeder brought out a new type of potato ...: <br><br>  December 4, 2007 7:33 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  Ignoring the pain, Baton ran forward, because his relatives were waiting for him at home: his wife ‚Äî Bun, son ‚Äî Donut, and grandfather ‚Äî old Bagel. <br><br>  December 4, 2007 9:36 <br>  Anonymous Art writes ... <br><br>  In the eyes of the already floated multicolored circles, but here Loona had the familiar feeling that he was being watched.  "Still, the grandfather is not so simple." - flashed through the tired brain - "Grandfather has a cover, and the cover is very professional ..." <br><br>  December 4, 2007 23:38 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  He is being watched! <br>  ‚ÄúWhy did I not poke out the second eye,‚Äù flashed through gavnyuk‚Äôs head ... <br><br>  December 4, 2007 23:45 <br>  Blogger Lexx writes ... <br><br>  But Baton still did not know about the super powers of the miracle card.  It is only at first glance that she can pierce buckets. <br><br>  December 5, 2007 0:50 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  and then he realized that the Belarusian grandpa-breeder knowingly so ardently guarded his garden!  There is power in potatoes!  Having put his hand into the bag and seizing a couple of karot, Baton threw the bag and ran home, stumbling over cucumbers-dildo and stepping on the zucchini vibrators ... :) <br><br>  December 5, 2007 1:24 <br>  Anonymous Art writes ... <br><br>  "Yes, yes," one potatoe said out of her pocket, "Did you think he was pulling the bucket up?"  , So that we do not read his thoughts !!! <br><br>  December 5, 2007 2:07 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  - Shut up shitty kartoha, - thought Baton, but in time he realized that there was no protective bucket on his head. <br><br>  December 5, 2007 2:51 <br>  Blogger Kopernik writes ... <br><br>  Potatoes were not appealing ... Pointed, talkative tubers rustled in one voice: ‚ÄúWe will eat your brain, you do not have time to find a suitable bucket‚Äù.  It was really creepy, but Baton was not scared, but only defiantly ate a couple of potatoes.  Then the nasty tubers settled down ... <br><br>  December 5, 2007 3:50 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  When I reached the house, I opened the door in a contentious way. Baton lurched into the kitchen and laid talking potatoes on the table ... What to do with them ?!  Turn them into crispy chips or fry alive, pre-dividing their bodies into cubes ?! <br><br>  December 5, 2007 4:03 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  An old marazmatik Bagel entered the kitchen, with a sluggish gait, and, with an unsteady gait, he headed for a shelf with knives, forks and spoons.  His brain was weak in perception, ‚Äúwhat could they have inspired by potatoes‚Äù, Baton thought in panic. <br><br>  December 5, 2007 4:17 <br>  Blogger Art.  writes ... <br><br>  - Hey, hey, man!  ‚ÄúWe can forgive the deaths of the two of us, but if we die, there is someone to take revenge for us!‚Äù Said the biggest one.  - Isn't it easier to talk with us, because with our strength you will become the ruler of the family, and maybe even the village !!! <br><br>  December 5, 2007 4:18 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  "I can become ... I can be ... a lord of kartoch, I will have power in me that is beyond the authority of anyone else ... I will create the Potato Fellowship" ... the whole world will be at my feet !!! <br><br>  December 5, 2007 4:23 <br>  Blogger HomelessIn writes ... <br><br>  Suddenly, the ears laid from a loud explosion and for a while there was a disgusting squeak at high frequency in my head <br><br>  opening his eyes, Baton saw that the part of the house where the bedroom was located is in ruins ... and clouds of smoke and burning evenly creep into the kitchen ... <br><br>  December 5, 2007 5:34 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  In vain grandfather dabbled with matches.  How many times did they speak to him, but he did not listen, now he will no longer hear ... Grabbing the potatoes of the potatoes from the table, Baton rushed to the exit.  I had to run again ... <br><br>  December 5, 2007 5:50 <br>  Blogger In_Perm writes ... <br><br>  Having run out into the yard, he froze in place.  He was stopped by an eerie sight.  Giant peaked tubers surrounded the house.  Their grandfather headed with a bucket on his head, from the eye of which a talking tuber was sticking out. <br><br>  December 5, 2007 9:47 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  - Surround it, save your own !!!  - screamed the one-eyed polukiborg grandfather. <br><br>  December 5, 2007 11:17 <br>  Blogger HomelessIn writes ... <br><br>  Meanwhile, at the other end of the galaxy, the Super Villain Tishman (sinister laughter ...) made plans to conquer the galaxy ... <br><br>  December 5, 2007 13:37 <br>  Blogger HomelessIn writes ... <br><br>  made plans to conquer the universe <br><br>  December 5, 2007 13:37 <br>  Blogger Kopernik writes ... <br><br>  Tishman looked again and again at the spherical model of the Universe, where all events were displayed in real time and selected the point from which he would begin to carry out his vile plan.  He was attracted to the solar system, there was a surge of energy over and over again. <br><br>  December 5, 2007 10:43 PM <br>  Blogger idler writes ... <br><br>  But he looked in the wrong direction, for the sunlight blinded him. <br><br>  December 5, 2007 23:15 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  The sunlight blinded him and he needed to do something to prevent the light from cutting his eyes.  His gaze fell on the intergalactic enamel bucket VX-3000 <br><br>  December 5, 2007 23:22 <br>  Anonymous Eles writes ... <br><br>  Angry thoughts buried in Tishman's brain.  He took a bucket and snarled terribly: "MY !!!" covered the sun with a bucket.  Darkness fell on Earth. <br><br>  December 5, 2007 23:58 <br>  Blogger idler writes ... <br><br>  That's the trouble he thought, because this bucket is more than a thousand years old, but I have not thrown garbage out of it. <br><br>  December 6, 2007 0:00 <br>  Blogger idler writes ... <br><br>  It was at this moment that the wicked Eles said, ‚ÄúLet there be a second sun,‚Äù and it appeared, and light spilled on the mortal earth, and the potatoes grew older. <br><br>  December 6, 2007 0:05 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  - Grandparent, sat down in amazement on the ground.  Well nisebe fig - I thought - two suns in the sky and a second crop of potatoes in a month. <br>  - What is it for??? <br><br>  December 6, 2007 0:45 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  At that moment, Baton heard the rest of the house collapse behind him.  But the polukiborg grandfather with a bucket on his head threw one of the cards into Batona ... <br><br>  December 6, 2007 12:49 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  The brakes squealed, a car jumped out of the pile from behind the barn.  This Bun decided to save a loved one. <br><br>  December 6, 2007 2:17 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  Bunka was a secret KGB agent. <br>  She worked for the Men In Black organization.  She had long been aware of potatoes and their old fart leader. <br><br>  December 6, 2007 2:21 <br>  Blogger idler writes ... <br><br>  And the old fart-leader, amended his plans.  He met the bun according to all the rules - warm and angry. <br><br>  December 6, 2007 2:41 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  Having reached the Baton, who had been a bit deceived by all these actions, Bun pulled him into the seat next to her and pressed on the gas. <br><br>  December 6, 2007 6:21 <br>  Anonymous Eles writes ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhere is the Donut?‚Äù Baton whispered hoarsely. <br>  - "Donut hit the paws to the police," replied Bun frantically twisting the steering wheel. <br><br>  December 6, 2007 7:43 <br>  Anonymous Diez writes ... <br><br>  - ‚ÄúUfff ...‚Äù said Donut with relief - ‚Äúat least there he is now safe and his grandfather-cyborg will not get him‚Äù <br><br>  December 6, 2007 11:13 <br>  Blogger idler writes ... <br><br>  Behind this, he bowed and disappeared.  Here's the deal - so thought the loaf. <br><br>  December 6, 2007 12:25 <br>  Blogger Alex writes ... <br><br>  Bunch realized that it was just buggy after yesterday's symposium at the cottage of one of the KGB officers.  She rubbed her eyes and again saw Baton sitting to her right. <br><br>  December 6, 2007 1:49 PM <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  Suddenly, Baton woke up ... Glancing over his eyes, he looked around ... He was in his kitchen.  Convulsively, with fear running his eyes through the kitchen, his gaze stopped ... under the table was a bag of potatoes.  Otlyaglo heart ... <br>  - Wow ... dream such a horror ... <br><br>  December 6, 2007 23:38 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  Suddenly, from under the table, right from where the potatoes stood, there were heard some shuffling sounds.  Soul of Baton went to the heels. <br>  - Meow, from behind the bag of a crib, the cat came out, the Blogbuster, and sweetly stretched. <br><br>  December 6, 2007 23:45 <br>  Blogger idler writes ... <br><br>  Woof-woof he said and curled up, again lay down to sleep.  No one knew what role, destined to be played in this story of Kotu-Kotofeichu. <br><br>  December 6, 2007 23:53 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  Tired Baton fell into bed and all night he dreamed of horrors.  He saw talking potatoes, mutants, extraterrestrial civilizations.  He dreamed of explosions and every time he woke up in a sweat, looking around the room! <br><br>  December 6, 2007 23:59 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  Waking up in the morning, Baton put his hands to his head, his head was splitting from pain.  Toli from a bad night, toli from a nightmare ... <br><br>  - ‚ÄúWe must go to the hospital‚Äù - a thought flashed through my head <br><br>  December 7, 2007 0:27 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  - Or maybe I drank yesterday and my head breaks from the morning hangover ?!  We need a hangover just in case. <br>  The baton stumbled into the kitchen and froze on the threshold ... Bodun walked right away, goosebumps running down the skin.  He was numb from what he saw ... <br><br>  December 7, 2007 1:41 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  At the table sat his grandfather, Old Bagel, and the cat Blogbaster. <br>  On the table was a bottle of vodka "Moonshine TASTY", around there were a couple of bottles of beer, and on the table was a potato and it was all whispering about something. <br>  Grandfather, cat and kartoha <br><br>  December 7, 2007 1:51 <br>  Blogger Alexander writes ... <br><br>  Suddenly, Baton heard his grandfather insistently say kartohe: "Show boobs!" <br><br>  December 7, 2007 12:32 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  Grandfather slowly began to chant: <br>  - Tits, boobs. <br>  In tune with him myrlykal and cat. <br><br>  December 7, 2007 12:55 <br>  Anonymous Anonymous writes ... <br><br>  A hologram of boobs slowly appeared on the table ... <br><br>  December 11, 2007 3:30 <br>  Blogger V_V writes ... <br><br>  The hologram shook, the boobs were gone, and in their place, a huge Fig appeared. <br><br>  December 11, 2007 5:19 <br>  Anonymous dimon writes ... <br><br>  The loaf was very much affected by such a mixture of boobs and a fig in this shtoto beat such a perverse, but in the morning it didn‚Äôt attract perversions and he immediately reached for vodka. <br><br>  December 11, 2007 12:39 <br>  Blogger KyivHomeless writes ... <br><br>  Pouring a hundred grams from a bubble into a faceted glass, the grandfather glanced at the bewildered Baton in the doorway. <br>  - Come in, granddaughter ... I was told here that you stole someone else's potatoes ... <br><br>  December 11, 2007 23:42 <br>  Anonymous dimon writes ... <br><br>  Yes, the gadi said lies Baton and thought to himself that the informers in the raspberry had started zavelsa.da how they knock on the table INTO the potatoes then and at once quieted down.
