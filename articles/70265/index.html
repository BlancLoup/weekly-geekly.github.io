  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Technical task? Go through the forest!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to start by saying that I have written over 200 technical assignments (TK) for my work in the development of software and websites.  From the smallest on 5-7 pages, to more developed on 100-150.  Among these projects there were also those that were not needed by the customers or the performers, and those in which the soul was invested - by all the project participants.  And what do I think about it now?  And I think that technical tasks are generally on ... <a name="habracut"></a>  Not needed. <br><br>  Including in general, all this canoe with a long pre-project preparation.  No, I agree, from the point of view of ‚Äúdissolving a client for loot‚Äù it‚Äôs cool to write documentation volumes and draw interface prototypes (forgive me, Yura, for these words).  Sometimes it is even useful.  All the more so that the mournful cries of developers on the subject of ‚Äúgive us detailed TZ‚Äù are generally elevated to the rank of great profession anecdotes. <br><br>  But for the most part, when it comes to production flow, all this can be thrown into the garbage.  What is really needed?

      And in fact it is necessary that the performers had a sane instrument.  It is necessary that the top management does not impute to its development department that platform, which was chosen ostensibly for market reasons.  It is necessary that the direct manager of the developers was not a senior farmer and spend at least an hour a day studying the new products of the market.  It is necessary that each developer knows and knows how to use the tool (whether it be a programming language, framework, platform, code editor).  And if he doesn‚Äôt know how or doesn‚Äôt like to do this, the brain wouldn‚Äôt have had anybody and would use his favorite tool in another company.  Making room for one who comes and applies all his talents here. <br><br>  Need a custom registration form?  Write the component, run the test.  Need to insert a clip of fresh video from YouTube?  Find a piece of code.  Need to calculate discounts on a monstrous algorithm with three pages of formulas?  Sit in a hug with a client in Excel, until you meet the numbers. <br><br>  If you are able and enjoy using the selected tool, then the implementation of any client's idea will be faster than described in the text.  Even if you will compete with a person who masterfully owns a 20-finger method of touch typing.  A client for ... does not need your TK or your paper prototypes.  He needs a working product - a living tool in which he invests money and who wants to apply as soon as possible in his market. <br><br>  When I hear from someone another screaming on the topic "I need detailed TK" - I do not remove this person from the number of specialists.  I cross out the entire development department, and management in addition. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70265/</a></p>
