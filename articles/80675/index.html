  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nokia 5800 and that did not like after a month of use</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  BACKGROUND </h4><br>  For about three or four years, I used the wonderful <a href="">Sony Ericsson k750i</a> .  But once, removing it from charging, the phone turns off right before your eyes ... Repeated switching on did not help.  The phone turns on, loads, goes into reboot, and in a circle ... Yeah.  Flew firmware, I thought (about a year before this happened to him a similar story).  He took the phone to the man, he tested it and made a verdict: the flash drive died.  I decided not to replace the flash drive, but to choose a replacement for a specific phone. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  NEW PHONE </h4><br>  In general, I somehow reconciled with the loss, and thought about buying a new phone.  Chose a long time and in different parameters.  In the end, the choice fell on the <a href="http://www.nokia.ru/products/phones/5800-xpressmusic">Nokia 5800 XpressMusic</a> .  I used it for about a month and decided to share my impressions with the masters.  In general, the phone is good.  Descriptions and specifications can be found both on <a href="http://www.nokia.ru/products/phones/5800-xpressmusic/specifications">the manufacturer‚Äôs website</a> and on <a href="">Yandex-Market</a> .  It makes no sense to tell more about it.  I'll tell you only what I personally did not like about him.  I will compare with the Sonerik I love. <br><br><h4>  THE MAIN THING </h4><br>  1. <b>Date and time format</b> <br>  Point is used as a separator.  both in date and in time.  At first it was not convenient, but eventually got used.  Not so critical. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      2. <b>View SMS delivery reports</b> <br>  In SE, delivery reports were not placed in a separate menu item.  Delivery status and when it was delivered, or was not delivered at all, it was possible to see in sv-wah the message itself. <br>  In Nokia, a separate item was created for this, with: <br><ul><li>  Displays delivery reports for only the last 20 messages; </li><li>  date-time format!  Only OR date is shown OR time.  with a separator in the form of a dot.  thus, if it is written, for example, 12.01, then we can only guess, this is 12th of January or 12 hours 01 minutes. </li></ul><br><br>  3. <b>Notebook</b> <br>  In the old days of old, when I did not have a sonerik yet, and the notebooks of the phones left much to be desired - I kept the contacts on the SIM card.  and in order to somehow distinguish the phone numbers of a person, if he has several of them, I added the code: 903/918/495 / ... at the end of the name <br><br>  Then the sonerik appeared and I completely transferred the contacts that no longer fit on the SIM card into his notebook.  A person could already add several numbers to one contact.  Moreover, each of the numbers had its own icon, in accordance with the selected type of number (mobile / home / work / fax ...). <br><br>  What is observed in Nokia?  Icons for different numbers (mobile / phone / ...) are really different.  Even when I accept an incoming call, the desired icon is displayed.  but what is found in SMS?  confusion!  In the ‚ÄúFrom‚Äù field, only the first name (last name-first name) is displayed  The icon that displays the number belonging to a particular type is missing.  How can I find out if it's a mobile number or what is another?  The number itself can be found only by viewing the message information.  The icon was never found. <br><br>  4. <b>photo gallery</b> <br>  I want to call "this" misery.  The interface of the image viewer itself is still nothing.  But what precedes it ... is something. <br>  How did I view the images on Sonerik?  I went to the folder I needed, chose an image, opened it.  I could watch the previous image, I could watch the following.  but these were images only within an open folder. <br>  And what is observed in Nokia?  I enter the gallery and it scans the ALL file system (both phone and flash cards) for images.  any.  both custom and used by one or another software.  and gives the result to the user.  please - view pictures.  but no need to look selectively - you, the user, see all the pictures!  all at once. <br>  And if I want to show a person selective images that are in a particular folder?  if I don't want to show EVERYTHING, because  There may be images that this person does not necessarily look?  you have to go through the file manager to the right folder and open from there.  okay, all-nothing, but.  next "but."  the images open, but the navigation available from the gallery (moving between images by swiping your finger across the screen in one direction or the other) is completely absent!  it is available only from the gallery itself. <br><br>  5. <b>music player</b> <br>  Approximately the same situation with the music player.  Comparison begins again with sonerika. <br>  I will not touch the music player itself and its functionality.  I will only touch on adding songs to the playlist. <br>  Compiling a playlist in Sonerika was implemented very conveniently.  I select ‚Äúcreate playlist‚Äù, click ‚Äúadd songs‚Äù, get to the file system and select this or that folder or file.  and, or immediately add it or mark it to add a few noted later. <br>  And what about the nokia?  I go to the music player, go to the playlists, choose "create a new".  Next, the phone scans the ALL file system for the presence of certain audio files (both user and used by some software) and gives the entire list to the user.  The compositions are grouped by performers, and if the ‚Äúperformer‚Äù parameter cannot be obtained from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3">ID3</a> (or other) tags, the compositions are grouped under the ‚ÄúNo data‚Äù performer.  It is very uncomfortable.  Personally for me.  And if I have two folders with songs in which the artist is not registered in the tags, do I need to select the necessary songs from ‚ÄúNo data‚Äù in order to add to the playlist, instead of choosing a specific folder? <br><br>  6. <b>Intraphone synchronization of contacts</b> <br>  Imagine the situation - you receive SMS from an unknown number.  For example, a work colleague or friend changes the phone number and notifies you about it.  What will you do?  That's right - put the new number in the contacts.  What should the phone have to do in the subsequent viewing of the ‚ÄúInbox SMS‚Äù folder?  Right!  - instead of a digital number, display how this person is recorded in contacts.  And what happens in Nokia?  Perhaps you guessed it?  The sender is displayed exactly as it was displayed the very first time this SMS arrived (i.e., if the number was +1234567 .., then it will be recorded in the ‚Äúfrom‚Äù field in SMS).  Of course, when you re-receive an SMS from a given number or send it to it, it‚Äôs exactly how the contact is recorded.  But why it is impossible to update this information for already existing SMS? <br><br>  7. <b>Saving phone numbers from the Sent Messages (SMS) section</b> <br>  Suppose you send an SMS to a certain number and after sending you want to save this number to your contacts.  How was this implemented on Sonerik?  I opened the sent SMS and chose the item in the menu ... if my memory serves me, it is called ‚Äúuse number‚Äù - there was a sub-item ‚Äúsave in contacts‚Äù in it.  And what awaits us in nokii?  Disappointment.  The only way to save the number to which you sent SMS is to copy it and paste it in the notebook itself by selecting ‚Äúadd contact‚Äù in it.  The save method implemented in Sonerik is also available in Nokia, but it works only for the ‚Äúinbox‚Äù section.  Why is that?  I do not know. <br><br>  In general, the phone is good, maybe it is worth its money, but I really don‚Äôt like the nuances described above ... I'm not going to change the phone to another one.  Most likely, I will get used to what is available.  I am not one of those who change phones every season.  After all, if you think so - why do you need a phone?  The main thing is that he called.  And it performs this function successfully. <br><br>  <b>UPD1</b> <br>  The first item is ‚Äútreated‚Äù quite simply (thanks for the hint in the comments): <br>  Menu ¬ªOptions¬ª Phone ¬ªDate and time <br>  - Date Separator <br>  - Time Separator </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80675/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80675/</a></p>
