It is very simple, it is easy to learn (I checked it in practice - it can really be mastered in one weekend).  Gorutiny, http-server and much more right out of the box, ease of reading someone else's code.  The Evangelicals of the language claim that the language was specifically created so that any newcomer could quickly go into the project and begin to figure out the code.  Those.  everything is made as simple as possible. <br><br>  Accordingly, for business this language is also very good - you take everyone in a row, roughly speaking, schoolchildren and students, you teach quite a bit, and voila, you have a team.  Try this with some c ++.

      At the mitap, there was an expression ‚Äúpick meat‚Äù that would write code.  This incidentally said the evangelist golang, who struggled to persuade everyone to go to go. <br><br>  Stop! <br>  He said ... <b>"meat" ??</b> <br><br>  He said so, I did not hear! <br><br>  And here, as they say, I was covered.  Do I want to make go my main language of development?  Those.  become ‚Äúmeat‚Äù? <br><br>  What are the perspectives of go language in terms of career growth?  If the language has an extremely low threshold of entry, then sooner or later all newcomers will be there, the supply will exceed the demand, and they can be taken as a ruble for a dozen. <br><br>  Well, let's say, money is not the most important thing. <br><br>  But even here go with its hyper simplicity will probably never be something exciting.  What is the challenge (except how to learn a new language over the weekend)?  Where is architecture, where are puzzle patterns about which you can argue with your colleagues? <br><br>  Well, that is, the benefits of go language for business are clear, but what about a programmer?  What is the motivation for the future? <br><br>  In fact, it strongly resembles the development of php in zero years.  Then the language was extremely simple, and due to this, absolutely everything began to be written on it.  Each student could throw a buggy saytik for a penny, not bothering with the PLO, patterns, and indeed with nothing. <br><br>  But!  Php has since become very complicated, improved, now it is a full-fledged language with a developed infrastructure and, in fact, already a rather big entry threshold.  Circuits, generators, full-fledged OOP, traits, optionally strict type checking, etc. were stuffed into the language.  Now, in order to find a normal php job, you need to know at least one rail-like framework. <br><br>  But go - not php.  He thought of a simple by design, and not because it happened.  And they will never go to complication. <br><br>  It is clear that knowledge of a language is only a small fraction of the work of a programmer.  You also need to understand the senseless murmur of the manager and turn it into a logical code.  You also need to be able to work with the database, be able to interact with colleagues in a team and thousands more of these things.  But other things being equal, the go language, it turns out, is probably not as interesting as the others. <br><br>  If you already look at fashionable languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor the future, then perhaps you should pay attention to rust or something like that.  There, without understanding the concept of ownership, you cannot even compile a helloworld-like program.  Here is the challenge! <br><br>  To summarize. <br>  Despite the fact that I wrote above, I still like the language) <br>  In general, for the time being I have decided for myself that I will probably use the go language for some things (for example, if I start stirring up some startup), but I will probably never make it my main one, i.e.  first line in a hypothetical future summary. <br><br>  Actually, it is very interesting to know the opinion of those who constantly write on go, share pliz what motivates you for the future.  This is the rare case when you really want to change your point of view on the opposite! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/281320/">https://habr.com/ru/post/281320/</a></p>
