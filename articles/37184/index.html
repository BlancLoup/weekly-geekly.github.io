And it is completely in vain!  Glasses with the processing of images of the surrounding world have long been implemented, and now they are being improved by cyborg enthusiast Steve Mann: <br> <a href="http://www.mccullagh.org/image/10d-11/steve-mann-eyetap.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/488/37a/9de/48837a9de8e0c5c01d3da4c5dff8f597.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Steve for several decades, first at MIT, then at his native University of Toronto, promoted the ideology of the ‚Äúworn‚Äù computer. <br><br><h1>  The main areas that Steve did </h1><ul><li>  <em>Development of technology <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeTap">EyeTap</a> .</em>  These are the same glasses that intercept the image entering the eye, and, having passed it through the computer, pass it further into the eye.  One of the models ready for mass production: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50a/0be/576/50a0be576c595340c6b50018492cbf8d.jpg"></li><li>  <em>Image processing technology.</em>  For example, Steve has a patent for the technology of splicing several video frames into a whole picture: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a4c/ed6/9ce/a4ced69cef67a76b9cbaaff9699fefc3.jpg"></li><li>  <em>CyborGLOGGING, reverse observation.</em>  Steve, as a self-respecting cyborg, develops and implements a cyborg ideology.  Cyblogging, or simply glogging, is a continuous posting of videos and photos taken by ‚Äúput on‚Äù cameras.  Steve even created a <a href="http://glogger.mobi/">service for gloggers</a> , on which he himself <a href="http://www.glogger.mobi/mann">conducts his own glog</a> .  <a href="http://wearcam.org/anonequity.htm">The reverse observation</a> is when, instead of the all-seeing eye of Big Brother, the record is kept by a wearable device of an ordinary citizen, as a rule, ‚Äúput on‚Äù: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f6/bf1/d82/5f6bf1d82c7bd836d3c05f5bab7ea66e.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ac/4cc/de8/0ac4ccde8a989ec0bdf2bacd493e8be5.jpg"><br>  This observation, of course, is initiated not by the state services for the sake of hidden control over citizens, but by a set of activists of the movement, for the sake of public use in diaries, all recorded information is as open as possible.  This is exactly how Mann sees the perfect observation: since the information is not secret, there can be no undercover games and corruption, if someone‚Äôs rights are violated, everyone will see it.  If the recording itself interferes with someone's private life - not a question, since everything is as open as possible, the information can be immediately deleted. </li></ul>

    <h1>  Cyborg problems </h1>  Now the most interesting: Steve Mann is an ardent ideologue and activist of his inventions and concepts.  Therefore, the last three decades, he carries a pile of iron.  This collage has flown around almost all online publications, as you see, up to the mid-90s, Steve had a hard time (literally): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a3/382/a57/6a3382a57ef23dfa84126312adf6ad53.jpg"><br><br>  Another very interesting fact from the life of Steve: February 18, 2002 <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html%3Fres%3D940CE0D71239F937A25750C0A9649C8B63%26sec%3D%26spon%3D%26pagewanted%3Dall">Steve was detained by the security</a> of St. John's Airport, Canada.  Until that moment, Steve flew around the world without difficulty, the security services arranged his equipment package (which included a personal doctor's certificate stating that Steve is conducting an experiment, and he is not recommended to walk without special equipment).  The New York Times wrote: during a personal search, employees scattered devices all over the floor (then the inventor was forgotten to return some of the equipment for almost $ 57,000), and the electrodes were torn off from Steve, which caused bleeding.  After the electronics were disabled, Steve lost his orientation in space (fell several times, hit his head on a hanging fire extinguisher once), and was taken to a landing in a wheelchair. <br><br>  On Slashdot, I found an <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl%3Fsid%3D02/03/14/2051228%26mode%3Dthread">interesting discussion about the incident</a> .  Unsubscribed several former and current students of Steve.  They claim that journalists have greatly exaggerated everything, students have personally seen how Steve sometimes removes his glasses and moves normally, that the inventor's equipment does not contain biometric sensors, much less implants.  One of Steve's MIT students has suggested that if you look at a two-dimensional picture of the world for a long time (through the screens of glasses), disorientation will definitely occur.  Someone suggested that Steve was just very upset about what happened.  In any case, everyone acknowledged that this is a very significant case from the series ‚Äúwhat will happen if you deprive a person of the hedges that help him live.‚Äù <br><br><h1>  Some photos </h1>  I will give a few illustrations that allow you to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of what Steve is doing.  Here is a group photo of MIT cyborg students taking part in Steve's early project on scanning the surroundings of the institute: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/27d/352/e27/27d352e279596d2e766a389b5bc1c5d5.jpg"><br><br>  Fantasy concept "Please Wait: I do not talk to strangers."  ‚ÄúInsert the passport in the reader on my head and only then will I see and hear you.
