  <section class="page js-page"><h1>JetBrains have published updates to the new licensing and pricing policy.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In early September, JetBrains <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2015/09/03/introducing-jetbrains-toolbox/">published the news</a> about changing the licensing model of their products - the company announced a transition from a perpetual license to a ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù model.  In the case of a subscription, the developer has access to the development environment only during the paid license, unlike the old model, when the developer had access to all updates during the paid license, and after the expiration he could continue to use the most recent version of the IDE released during this period. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company explained this step by the desire to change the approach to monetization: it would focus on correcting existing bugs and not introducing more and more new features (sales, obviously, correlated with the release of new versions of products, which are more motivating to work on quantity and not on quality) and the desire to optimize licensing costs of ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù developers who work on projects for several months and who do not need an IDE on an ongoing basis ‚Äî it is more profitable for such developers (especially if they are outsourcing consultants) to pay for  nkretnye months license.  It is also likely that a monthly license is easier to ‚Äúsell‚Äù to a client along with a consultation than to persuade a monthly project to acquire a full license for IDE, which is also interesting for corporate outsourcing clients of JetBrains. <br><br>  The news was met quite negatively, it was difficult to find even neutral ones among the hundreds of comments to the news, and for several days JetBrains <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2015/09/04/we-are-listening/">stated</a> that the new licensing model is still raw and will be refined taking into account the wishes of customers. <br><br>  Today you can <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/">get acquainted with the updates</a> to the new licensing policy JetBrains.  It is obvious that the JetBrains team heard the developers and offered a very flexible licensing system, which in fact combines a subscription with a perpetual license:

      1) The new license paid for up to 12 months is a net lease: use while you pay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/593/e0d/9f9/593e0d9f9a06466b85f3b72efd6db2a9.png"><br><br>  2) A new license paid for 12 months or more - gets all the same updates as part of the lease, but after the end of the lease the developer owns the ‚ÄúPerpetual fallback license‚Äù - the developer can use the version of the IDE that was relevant exactly 12 months before the end of the payment rent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04b/ae6/da5/04bae6da55ff4a60ae186731bd22ba36.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e0/e95/e86/4e0e95e8639448cf949fb0c2f8ac93e3.png"><br><br>  3) With the annual continuous renewal of the license, NEW clients are granted a progressive discount: the second year of rent is cheaper by about 20% than the first, the third year is cheaper by about 20%. <br><br>  4) When extending a license for a year, EXISTING customers (as well as those who have an old license expired less than 12 months before switching to a new licensing model) - the first year of the rental immediately with the maximum discount (which new customers receive only in the third year), plus the second year rental included <i>absolutely free</i> ! <br><br>  Here, on Habr√©, in the news about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/266547/">new licensing model</a> there are comments from JetBrains explaining some of the nuances missed in the official announcement, for example: when renewing a license on a ‚Äúlease‚Äù basis, the developer who had previously had no regular license does not lose it, quietly "roll back" to the version that he had before the lease.  Apparently the extremely negative public reaction forced the company to smooth down the negative with additional pluses to the new licensing model. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267517/</a></p>
