  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Education: psychological aspect</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In session time on Habr√©, there is clearly a surge in activity on blogs about education.  And, of course, posts mostly negative content.  Logic, as you know, is a sales pelt, and it is sold to emotions, because we, the students, would be better off talking about education by closing the session, or even 2-3 years after graduation.  But nevertheless, since I got so drunk, I would venture to insert my five kopecks in support of our education. <br><br>  I would venture because there are so many psychological factors that will not allow students to agree with me.  Actually it will be, basically, just about psychology. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Motivation and emotions </h4><br>  Learning, as you know, is not a pleasant process.  To master something new, a person has to go out of his comfort zone, and he didn‚Äôt have to do what he did before.  Such actions require motive.

      Our education, which grew out of the Soviet one, differs from the capitalist one in that the student‚Äôs emotions can be neglected, since he does not pay money and, by and large, he has no choice.  Therefore, our motivation mechanisms are appropriate - for students in progress - scholarship, for those who do not succeed - fear of exclusion, followed by dropping out of the collective, army and, possibly, less prestigious work. <br><br>  In addition, when the family watch TV nearby, the brother-sister plays with the dog [to add something] very hard to force yourself to sit down for lessons.  Therefore, at the lectures of some teachers the main way of motivation is to intimidate students.  It happened.  This is done both by a direct method - a reminder of the upcoming control, and indirectly - by a reluctance to interpret the material, to pause for better perception, and so on.  The result is negative emotions. <br><br>  Abroad, emotions can not be neglected, otherwise they will not pay.  There, the student is allowed to choose between subjects - this is also a motive, since he chose himself, so I will teach.  The fee itself is also a motive - since I pay so much, so I will learn.  They can leave the subject "for re-study", and this money, respectively, is also a motive.  And, finally, the majority of universities in the first year, without fail, all students lodge in a dormitory.  Unlike our hostels, there, by a combination of other motives, everyone learns, and therefore it is easier for them in the hostel to force themselves to do their homework. <br><br><h4>  Width and depth </h4><br>  Since I am crying, I am free to have my judgment on what I should learn and what not.  As a result, having entered a foreign university, I can independently choose subjects and not deviate one step from studying them, as the teacher, in fact, is my hired worker. <br><br>  Is it our business?  The party does you a favor by learning you, and therefore it is free to determine what you will learn.  In addition, each teacher considers it his duty to make you a man according to his convictions. <br><br>  A strange thing - the teacher puts the question marks on the margins of your work, and does not explain at all what the problem is.  How will this help me to become a good physicist / chemist / astronaut [to add the necessary]? <br><br>  It has nothing to do with direct physics, but it is a different task - take it I don‚Äôt know what and go there I don‚Äôt know where and don‚Äôt know what I like.  The solution was simple - take a note from a friend, and see what he did and how.  I know it sounds ridiculous, but do you think life will not set such tasks before you?  I am convinced that there will be. <br><br>  There are more difficult tasks - the teacher does not like it when they quickly speak, or vice versa, they delay the answer.  Your task is to determine this and correct your behavior.  Also very vital task. <br><br>  My case - the teacher refuses to answer questions at the consultation, and directs me to the outline.  Be sure, he does it not so much because of his inherent laziness, how much for me to learn to use the abstract. <br><br>  You need to learn to see these indirect tasks, which the teacher sets for you intentionally or unintentionally, and learn how to make their decision the same educational process as studying the subject in your specialty.  After all, to call yourself a smart person, you must be able to get out of such situations. <br><br><h4>  Comfort zone </h4><br>  The usual situation - you had a whole semester to learn the material, but you do everything on the last night before the exam.  Why?  Because before the exam, your motivation is stronger than on a regular day.  If you need a weighty motive in order to do this work, then this work to a certain extent lies beyond your comfort zone. <br><br>  If the task is in your comfort zone, then you will not have a weighty motive to go to Habr and find fault with our education.  You do it and forget it.  If the task is outside your comfort zone, then you will not use the skill necessary to solve it in everyday life.  Since we have agreed that most of the direct and indirect tasks that you face at the institute are useful for life, then you need to transfer this task to your comfort zone.  Make it easy - a repetition. <br><br>  As a bonus, you will get a skill that will help you easier to leave the comfort zone, and, accordingly, learn. <br><br><h4>  Morality </h4><br><ol><li>  You should think that the institute gives you nothing only if you have solid fives and at the same time do not do anything that takes you out of the comfort zone. </li><li>  The institute will bring you negative emotions, this is normal, and even good.  This means that you are changing, and most likely for the better. </li><li>  Do the struggle with the most stupid requirements of the teacher with your tasks on an equal basis with the study of the specialty.  If you think about the stupidity of the requirements, then these requirements take you out of the comfort zone, and you should work on yourself. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81803/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81803/</a></p>
