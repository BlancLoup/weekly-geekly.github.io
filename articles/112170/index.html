Alas, these words did not make this true.  Unfortunately, Elena has closed her publications for comments, and I cannot answer them.  I have to report on its publication the following. <br><br>  In short: <br>  - I did not conduct business there - I am not a businessman by nature - but only collected computers; <br>  - I did not part with the project - in December 2010 I participated in the ‚Äú1st International Forum - an exhibition of innovative technologies for the elderly and people with a special social status‚Äù, which was held by ‚ÄúGrandma Online‚Äù.  Asya Konstaninovna was personally invited; <br>  - there was no duplicate of the site, there is no lion care; <br>  - I did not organize any group of ‚Äúunscrupulous young people‚Äù, I did not engage in any gathering by the group among the population and commercial firms. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Lagoda</b> : At the beginning of 2009, Volodya Deribin literally asked for work in the project ‚ÄúGrandmother Online‚Äù, and the project management met him halfway, believing his promises about voluntary assistance and providing a workshop for collecting and repairing used computers transferred by philanthropists.

      <b>I:</b> Not true.  I have already participated in similar projects, but smaller ones (‚Äúcomputers for the disabled‚Äù - there are telephones for communication).  ‚ÄúGrandma Online‚Äù seemed bigger and more attractive.  I came and offered my help.  Asya Konstantinovna (project manager) said that yes, they really need help, and computers too, and that the project will gladly accept me as an assistant.  There was no suggestion. <br><br>  <b>Lagoda</b> : But in fact, it happened that the workshop began to be used as a personal business of Volodya and his friends. <br><br>  <b>Me:</b> Not true, and up to "the opposite."  I did not conduct any business there - I am not a businessman by nature - but only collected computers.  This Asya Konstantinovna herself has repeatedly said - "Volodya, you can be engaged in some business in this room, if you want, if only the project had computers and facilities."  There are also witnesses to these words. <br><br>  <b>Lagoda</b> : Volodya Deribin showed personal initiative (without the knowledge of the project management) and began to engage in so-called ‚ÄúInformation Support‚Äù for his own PR. <br><br>  <b>I:</b> Not true.  About ‚Äúwithout the knowledge‚Äù - Asya Konstantinovna was clearly, unequivocally and repeatedly stated - ‚ÄúVolodya, we need computers by any means.  You're a computer geek - do something, look among your own. ‚Äù  I, as a programmer, and began to use the medium available to me - the computer environment.  I gave links to Artemy Lebedev's blog with information about the project to the project management.  Links to Habr√© - yes, he didn‚Äôt give, but he brought the iron from Habr, and brought Hrr to the project from Habr (see below). <br>  About PR - I came to the project to do good deeds, not to promote, and I did not engage in any self-promotion.  All my appearances in interviews and informational messages were aimed at providing effective assistance to the project. <br><br>  <b>Lagoda</b> : In December 2009, the project management, having exhausted its credibility, "thanked" Volodya Deribin for the work and broke off relations with him. <br><br>  <b>I:</b> This is not true.  In December 2010, I participated in the ‚Äú1st International Forum - an exhibition of innovative technologies for the elderly and people with a special social status‚Äù, which was held by ROO AIV - an organization whose actual leader is Asya Konstantinovna, and which runs the project ‚ÄúGrandma online. "  Asya Konstaninovna was personally invited.  Witnesses on the forum - volunteers and grandparents.  There are photos of my master class.  The previous day before that, I was left in charge with two more volunteers in the museum, where there was a forum, and until one o'clock in the morning we set up IBM multimedia projectors and laptops (that is, quite expensive equipment).  Witnesses - two volunteers, as well as the current head of the technical department David.  Before that, I personally received one of the projectors in the social service of the Vyborgsky district, and delivered it back after the forum.  A witness is an employee of a social service who issued / received a projector and also saw me at the forum.  Before that, I also attended a meeting of volunteers in the office where master classes were distributed - there are volunteer witnesses.  Also in the summer I helped the project to organize a concert with a buffet for grandmothers in the house of culture ‚Äî transporting pastries from the bakery to the house of culture in my car.  Witnesses are volunteers who unload it.  At the time of publication of Elena's article, I also did not receive any notifications from anyone from the project management that I no longer participate in the project.  At the time of the publication of these my comments - too. <br><br>  <b>Lagoda</b> : The management did not regret about the decision: after the transfer of the workshop to a new specialist, the work on assembling the incoming used computers was put in order and as a result, by the end of 2010, 30 classes were opened, in which 1,570 people had already been trained. <br><br>  <b>I:</b> Not true.  As of December 2010, according to Asya Konstantinovna, told to me personally in the project office, 22 classes were opened.  The rest of the rooms were empty - there were not enough computers.  It is easy to check - ask ROO AIV to list the addresses of the classes and travel around them, looking at how open and working they really are. <br><br>  It is not true that everything was very bad with me.  The result of my publications on Habr√© was, in particular, my acquaintance with the company "Arutek", which I brought into the project.  At first, ‚ÄúArutek‚Äù presented the project with a multiseat workstation (one system engineer, four monitor-keyboard-mice), and then, to my knowledge, equipped several project classes with new computers.  That is, the classes did not open in spite of, but thanks to me.  My correspondence on Habr√© with ‚ÄúArutek‚Äù has been preserved, and the employees of ‚ÄúArutek‚Äù will be able to confirm these facts.  Also, thanks to the first publication on my request in a blog from Artemy Lebedev, we were interviewed by Echo of Moscow and the federal TV channel Vesti (I can provide links to the interviews).  This can be confirmed by the employees of Echo of Moscow and Vesti. <br><br>  <b>Lagoda</b> : The staff was called back and told a lot of things: how people try, stretch, do a good thing without too many sentences, and about how a certain fraudster Volodya "worked actively in the project".  The very respondent Habra and the author of letters to Temme, who in the simplicity of his heart left in the letters and posts the contacts of the school and his personal contacts. <br><br>  <b>I:</b> Problem.  ‚ÄúA certain fraudster‚Äù left his personal contacts ‚Äúfor the simplicity of his soul‚Äù - a ‚Äúfraudster‚Äù is good. <br><br>  <b>Lagoda</b> : Quote: <br>  ‚ÄúContact me (I am responsible for the technique) in the following ways: <br>  During business hours, you can call (812) 575-13-73.  If you do not pick up the phone, or answer the fax, you can call +7 (950) 022-56-77.  E-mail: babushkaonline@gmail.com <br>  My name is Vladimir.  Thanks for the help!".  The second phone number and mail is his personal. <br><br>  <b>Me:</b> Distortion of facts.  My personal data is published second, and it is clearly stated that you can call me, ‚Äúif you do not pick up the phone‚Äù - that is, as a backup option.  So it is written in all my mass publications: <a href="http://tema.livejournal.com/336580.html">tema.livejournal.com/336580.html</a> , <a href="http://tema.livejournal.com/802994.html">tema.livejournal.com/802994.html</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/109004/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/109004</a> .  The quote is written "(I answer for the technique)."  The date of the post quoted is April 2009, when I was the head of the technical department and was really in charge of the equipment. <br><br>  <b>Lagoda</b> : In the end, when someone's good soul called this ‚ÄúGrandma ...‚Äù and said that their website has a double and that the lion‚Äôs share of traffic and traffic goes there, it became clear that Volodya was mainly pursuing his own interests, and that he went further than simply giving his contacts in letters of appeal. <br><br>  <b>I:</b> Not true.  There was no duplication of the site and no, the lion‚Äôs departure of traffic, respectively, either.  Technicians will easily prove it.  It is possible that the suspicion of a double occurred because the consonant domains babushka-online.ru and dedushka-online.ru are registered to me.  They always, from the moment of registration, were redirected to the main site.  I registered them on May 6, 2009, after the publication on April 27, 2009, from Tyoma, so that they would not be intercepted by cybersquatters.  I have an agreement for NIK.RU and money - ROO AIV has neither one nor the other.  So I registered for myself.  In December 2010, an agreement was reached with the management on the legal transfer of domains to ROA AIV during January.  The process goes on.  That is, the project management at least in December 2010 knew about the existence of these domains, knew that they were written to me, knew that they were redirected to the original site, and that they would be transferred to ROO AIV.  Witnesses to that, besides the project manager Asya Konstantinovna - three people who were present at the meeting.  Regarding ‚Äúno money from ROO AIV‚Äù: in that period, I paid ROO AIV phones with my money several times so that they would not be disconnected for non-payment, and that the connection with the project would not be lost - if Petroelectricity has an archive of receipts, then theoretically you can ‚Äúraise ", Make graphological examination of the signature, and make sure that the signature was made by me. <br>  <b>Update of January 22, 2010:</b> The following was written on the project forum: ‚ÄúEverything in the article is true and from the heart.  <b>(except for the stolen traffic, well, an unenlightened man wrote, didn‚Äôt put it that way, apologize for that !!!)</b> .  Here is a screenshot: <a href="">gyazo.com/660e3c7dbd4919df4c944bb9e20a18d0.png The</a> topic itself on the forum for the time being was cut out.  I left in the .mht first 20 pages, + all the comments came to me in the mail. <br><br>  <b>Lagoda</b> : And today such unscrupulous young people have gathered a whole group, They seem to be volunteers of the project, they collect computer equipment from the population and commercial companies solely for personal gain. <br><br>  <b>I:</b> Not true.  I did not organize any group of ‚Äúunscrupulous young people‚Äù, I did not engage in any gathering by the group among the population and commercial firms.  I cannot yet prove that I did not create such a group, because I don‚Äôt know how to prove the absence of something that never happened. <br><br>  <b>Lagoda</b> : PS.  There is a certain system of universal coordinates, which is the same for all.  It is impossible to be both good and bad in it, so that for everyone to steal it is impossible, and for Volodya Deribin and his ilk a little bit is possible.  On the one hand, he helped the project ‚Äúwith its own Habras‚Äù a little.  But his ‚Äúshadow business‚Äù, of course, is ... <br><br>  <b>I:</b> Not true.  There was no ‚Äúshadow business‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Me:</b> The most annoying thing is the harm that Elena‚Äôs publication ‚ÄúGranny Online‚Äù can do.  I did everything to find only the good when searching for the project name on the Internet.  Now this is no longer the case.  What to say about people who used to help the project - now they will think that they have helped fraudsters to profit.  This story dealt a heavy blow to the entire project. <br><br>  <b>Me:</b> Those who still wish to help ‚ÄúGranny Online‚Äù can still contact the office of the ROO AIV (317-85-53, 317-86-67) or the project workshop (575-13-73). <br><br>  <b>Results and conclusions for February 2, 2011: The</b> ‚Äúofficial confirmation‚Äù of the information presented by Lagoda from the site of Grandma-Online has been removed altogether.  Instead, a certain ‚Äúhistory‚Äù of my relationship with the project, as seen by the project management, was published.  Virtually nothing remained of previous accusations, and there are practically no new ones.  This ‚Äústory‚Äù has already ‚Äúmoved‚Äù to the news archive, is not visible on the main page, is currently available only in the links to the right.  <b>All</b> topics where people were interested in the problem, and where I gave my explanations, and the people under the admin nickname - their own, from the forum site removed altogether.  Lagoda is silent, the guide is silent.  <b>My conclusion:</b> I, as an IT specialist, tried to make the project popular and famous in the IT world.  Unfortunately, the project management, due to its computer illiteracy and the misunderstanding of information circulation in the IT world, did a very bad thing ‚Äî not just dropping my efforts to zero, but dropping the project's reputation in the IT world into a deep minus.  Pichalka. <br><br>  <b>Update of March 18, 2011:</b> in the evening the project leader called.  I wondered where I was gone, and why I do not declare.  I could only answer something unintelligible - I was not ready to call.  At the same time asked to re-send the password on the contract for ny.ru.  Sent  Third series?
