  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Service Desk quick start. Part 2 - creating a service catalog</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the continuation of the cycle. <br>  In the first part, we decided whether you need to build the service desk. <br>  At the second stage, you need to understand exactly what services your technical support service provides.  This is part of the Service Portfolio Management process.  You need to understand what your technical support service should do and, what is equally important, what it should not do. <br><br>  For this, a portfolio of services is being formed.  According to the classical methodology, the portfolio includes all the services provided, developed and already decommissioned services. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/333/9f5/eea/3339f5eea7634fafb81d135f27cb2387.jpeg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Services are divided into main, auxiliary and complementary.  Services external and internal. <br><br>  We consider the situation when the IT department provides services within the company (that is, all the services are internal) and there is already some department experience that can be used to form a service portfolio. <br><br>  According to the ITIL methodology, this is a separate process - the process of managing relationships with a business (BRM).  The goal of this process is to establish interaction between the IT department and the business.  Ensure that IT understands business needs, and businesses understand IT capabilities.  It is the person responsible for the relationship with the business that should build a dialogue.  As a rule, it is a CIO or IT manager. <br><br>  When compiling a portfolio of basic services, it is important to operate not with technical, but with business terms.  Business does not need servers, business does not need file storage.  Business wants to make a profit. <br>  Therefore, services should sound like: trade, file storage, visitor counting system, time tracking system, etc. <br><br>  This means that the IT service is committed to providing this service.  If this service is not provided, then the business does not care why it is not provided.  He is only interested in when it will be restored and how to avoid relapse? <br>  The portfolio also needs to include ancillary (technical) services on which the business services are based.  They are of little interest to the business, but their necessity and importance will have to be defended when forming a portfolio.  They serve as the basis for the operation of business services. <br><br>  In my opinion, during the initial formation of a portfolio of services, it is necessary to make a list of services, a description of services, indicate the time of service availability, technological windows and find out the criticality of services for a business.  In my opinion, it‚Äôs still not necessary to ask the SLA at this stage.  Based on the criticality of services, you can record the wishes of the business to the level of service.  And only some time later, during the actual operation of this service, it is possible to draw any conclusions and begin to write service level agreements that the IT service can really guarantee. <br><br>  Surely your company already has some experience providing technical support to users.  Based on this experience and the profile of the company, you can begin to create a list of services provided.  This will be the first step. <br><br>  The second step is to determine the business requirements for services and make a description of services.  What the business considers an acceptable level of service provision, and what is not. <br><br>  For example, consider the ‚Äúdata storage‚Äù business service.  In the description of the service, it can be stated that the IT department guarantees each employee of the company a dedicated place in the amount of 1 Gb on the corporate network storage with the possibility of sharing.  Service availability time from 9:00 to 21:00.  At the same time, this service is based on such technical services as ‚Äúsupport for servers and clusters‚Äù, ‚Äúlocal area network‚Äù, ‚Äústorage and network storage‚Äù, ‚Äúdata backup‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5a/8a7/ebf/b5a8a7ebf0704eacbcfe6976e2d18036.png"><br><br>  After that, it is necessary to determine the value of this service for business.  If this is just a file storage with photos from the corporate party, then the value of this service is not very great and the business will not suffer much if it is idle.  If this is one of the main tools when interacting with customers, then even the minimum idle time of this service will result in large monetary losses. <br><br>  After determining the value of the service can be determined with the wishes to the level of service and finance.  Based on the severity of the service, it is possible to determine what priority to put to incidents related to this service, what means are needed to provide it at the stated level.  Based on the further practice of using the service, it will be possible to adjust either financial support or wishes to the level of service. <br><br>  Once you have decided on the service catalog, you can proceed to the next stage - creating a single window, entry point.  In essence - the formation of the incident management process. <br><br>  I will talk about this in more detail in the next article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295248/</a></p>
