My good friend, let's say, took part in the filming of the <a href="">legendary film</a> about podcasting.  We walked in the park near the Central House of Artists and she excitedly talked about the film and podcasting.  I remember it and when my son was born, I firmly decided that it was imperative to record a podcast.  It took me half a year to find 5 minutes and record the first episode - terribly funny and ridiculous :) And I immediately dragged on: the main job (I worked on Hit-FM) had tough restrictions on the chronomedraction and themes for airtime, and in the podcast you could talk as much as you want and what you want!

It all happened by chance.  I chose the cover art for the first issue (long before writing it down) and came across a picture that caught my attention.  It was a successful and dynamic photo of a roller coaster.  And in my head Gorky Park stuck together and thought about the podcast.  So it happened - Rosnovsky Park of culture and recreation named after me :) <br><br>  <strong>freetonik: Are there any plans to develop, change your podcast?</strong> <br><br>  Artem: Since September I plan to open a new season.  There will be a lot of changes, but they should not alienate the faithful listeners, but rather attract new listeners.  I will not say anything more. <br><br>  <strong>freetonik: Does popularity make itself known?</strong>  <strong>How often do they recognize you on the streets?</strong>  <strong>:)</strong> <br><br>  Artem: And I am not on the streets.  I'm a motorist.  From home to work, from work to the sports club, from there to home.  When we go with a family somewhere or walk - no, no one will know.  But there were strange situations when complete strangers turned out to be podcast listeners and knew about my existence :) <br><br>  <strong>freetonik: You often post videos about your personal life, work, travel.</strong>  <strong>Were there any ideas to do video podcasting?</strong>  <strong>How do you feel about video podcasting?</strong> <br><br>  Artem: I dream to do video podcasting.  My creativity is definitely not enough for what Unknown People do, for example, but I really want to make interesting video programs. And there are ideas and technology, but so far there is not enough time, then the experience of creating really good videos. <br><br>  <strong>freetonik: You work on the radio and in podcasting.</strong>  <strong>What should you learn from traditional radio podcasting and vice versa? ... and what do you personally enjoy doing?</strong> <br><br>  Artem: Well, to tell you the truth, this is not a completely correct comparison - radio and podcasting.  For example, radio still brings me the main income :) From this point of view, working at Mayak is pleasant.  It is also pleasant that the audience of our morning air is two orders of magnitude larger than the entire audience of Russian listeners - the scale of coverage is fundamentally different.  Podcasting is incomparably more pleasant because all the air is in my power.  I am talking about what is interesting to me and the audience, not looking at the format or instructions from above.  Podcasting from the radio should learn the sound. <br><br>  There is, of course, Umputun, who brought his sound to a level where not every radio station can compete in quality.  Sometimes it's a shame when a great podcast is heard so badly that it's impossible to listen.  Radio podcasting could take over the coverage of topics.  We have very few conversational radio stations, and this personally depresses me. <br><img title="rosnovsky_radio" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/rosnovsky_radio.jpg" width="500" height="375"><br>  <strong>freetonik: Russian podcasting is booming.</strong>  <strong>How do you think, is it still long to wait for a global increase in the audience, a major qualitative leap in this area?</strong> <br><br>  Artem: As soon as at least half of Russians will be connected to the megabit unlimited Internet, it will be possible to say that conditions have been created for the explosive growth of podcasting.  In the meantime, the potential audience is limited to several large cities, alas: ( <br><br>  <strong>freetonik: Apart from the problems of the poor quality of the Internet, why do you think podcasting is not so popular in runet comparing with the same blogging?</strong> <br><br>  Artem: There are natural limitations.  For example, most people do not perceive information by ear, this is normal.  Therefore, training materials are always duplicated by texts and diagrams, and the radio has an incomparably smaller audience than television.  And I did not think that ‚Äúit‚Äôs better to see once than to hear a hundred times‚Äù.  Therefore, blogging all over the world is more popular than podcasting.  Another thing is that in the West there are podcasts, the audience of which is greater than the number of all high-speed Internet connections in Moscow. And we are still far from such a scale.  Plus, of course, a serious limitation is Russian.  It speaks very few people, compared with the same English.  But this is a natural limitation, while it is too early to think about it. <br><br>  <strong>freetonik: What do you think is not enough for Russian podcasting now?</strong> <br><br>  Artyom: Diversity.  The huge glade is not disclosed at all. <br><br>  <strong>freetonik: You can ask your opinion about the two podcast terminals: ppod and PFM?</strong>  <strong>Do I need to change rpoda?</strong>  <strong>Will the FMF "win"?</strong> <br><br>  Artem: The <a href="http://rpod.ru/">rpod</a> needs to be changed, since the same <a href="http://podfm.ru/">subfm</a> now functionally makes rpod as standing.  At the same time, rpp central terminal, with history and subfm will need to make great efforts to attract the audience to yourself.  And in this ‚Äúbattle‚Äù the listener will win.  And a podcaster :) And if the podcast terminals become 10 times larger, the overall victory of the listeners and podcasters will be closer :) <br><br>  <strong>freetonik: What do you think about sound in such amateur work as podcasting: what position do you share - Strelnikova ‚Äúyou can write for anything‚Äù or Umputuna - you can‚Äôt write anything for anything!</strong> <br><br>  Artem: If the author has a desire to do well, you can write on the built-in microphone, then spend a couple of hours on sound and eventually get a bad, but tolerable sound.  After all, this is an attitude to the audience: you should not force to listen, to strain your ears in order to make out what it is about.  This is disrespectful.  On the other hand, it often happens that interesting people do not want or are not able to spend money on expensive equipment.  This, of course, should not stop those who actually have something to say.  So we need some kind of compromise against the background of striving for the perfect sound. <br><img title="rosnovsky_tired_at_work" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/rosnovsky_tired1.jpg" alt=" " width="375" height="500"><br>  <strong>freetonik: In the west, many famous podcasts have sponsorship.</strong>  <strong>How soon can we expect this on the same scale?</strong> <br><br>  Artem: Advertising in podcasts goes, albeit slowly.  Both ‚Äú <a href="http://u8.rpod.ru/">Tits-pussies</a> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="http://vedomosti.ru/podcast">Vedomosti</a> ‚Äù, and even in my podcast, advertisements of the company have already been placed on rather large and well-known companies.  Podcasting offers advertisers a not too extensive, but prepared and high-quality audience.  This is his huge advantage over the ‚Äúsparrow shooting‚Äù on the radio, when the coverage is huge and the effect is mediocre.  There will be more audience - there will be more interest of advertisers. <br><br>  <strong>freetonik: If it's not a secret, which podcasts do you listen or watch?</strong> <br><br>  Artem: I have 4 dozen subscriptions in iTunes!  Everything is interesting there, from various podcasts and <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/help.html">video podcasts from NASA / ESA</a> to " <a href="http://echo.msk.ru/contributors/4769/">Melted Cheesecake</a> " Shenderovich "Echo of Moscow" :) <br><br>  <strong>freetonik: As far as we, the listeners know, you prefer the Apple technique.</strong>  <strong>And the experience of Windows, for sure, was;) What memories?</strong> <br><br>  Artem: What memories can there be ?!  I know how the registry works, how Windows works, why it doesn't work, and how to make it work.  I have been using a PC with DOS and Windows for 10 years.  And I don‚Äôt want to know all this.  I have a poppy for more than two years and I have no idea how MacOS works.  It does not break, it just works, it does it beautifully and effectively.  And each collision with Windows is only more depressing and frustrating that this craft is a de facto standard :( <br><br>  <strong>freetonik: Most potential, let's say, podcasters now come to the podcastim.ru website.</strong>  <strong>Doubt, but often thinking about podcasting as a new way of self-realization.</strong>  <strong>What can you advise them as an experienced professional?</strong> <br><br>  ABOUT!  I, as an experienced professional, can say one thing: do not make yourself an idol :) Podcasting is the same area where everyone is his own main character, character, director and editor.  Sick, accumulated words and thoughts - go ahead, podcasting is waiting for you! <br><br>  <a href="http://www.podcastim.ru/2008/05/intervyu-s-artemom-rosnovskim/">Original on podkastim.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26205/</a></p>
