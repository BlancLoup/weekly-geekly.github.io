The author <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/173725/">of the update review</a> reported that there are already about 200 applications, which made me very happy, and I rushed to view everything.  But, having spent more than one hour, I finally found <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dit.cameraclick.com">only one</a> , which in the end I still partially disappointed.  Are there really no applications that can really unlock the potential of the ‚ÄúWatch - Phone‚Äù bundle?  After all, their absence forced me to throw this watch a couple of weeks after the purchase.  Or is the principle of such a bundle in real life unpromising and suitable only for checking Twitter from a clock?  Asking these questions, I, as a designer (from the word design to design), decided to arrange a small brainstorm on the topic ‚ÄúApplications that can unlock the potential of the SmartWatch + Phone bundle‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  7 dream apps (mine) </h4><br>  The most interesting options for potential applications (in my opinion) that work best in a pair of watches + telephone.

    <h5>  The first </h5><br>  Probably everyone in the Habr√© heard about smart alarm clocks (and someone even bought it), which recognize the phases of sleep and call at the most opportune moment for awakening.  Why not use SmartWatch for this purpose?  I understand that an accelerometer or something like this is present in the clock, since in the new firmware there is a version of the clock that turns on when you turn your hand.  Plus, I met the Level app for the same watch.  So: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e1e/cb3/e0b/e1ecb3e0bdbb6bdc695621f15a177c4a.png"><br><br><h5>  The second </h5><br>  We use GPS in the phone, we calculate the speed and put it on the clock screen, which in turn act as a cycle computer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/522/af4/4dc/522af44dc092fabe02445be4976ad30d.png"><br><br><h5>  Third </h5><br>  I recently read a sad story about wireless headphones in which a person found out that his phone was stolen only after the subway car pulled away from the station and the headphones suddenly stopped working.  On this topic the following application: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/423/220/362/423220362a57280b1e89be6adfaa9534.png"><br>  <i>As far as I understand, the strength of the transmitted bluetooth signal can calculate the approximate distance from the watch to the phone?</i> <br><br><h5>  Fourth </h5><br>  Everyone probably had cases when they just wanted to take pictures against the background of a beautiful landscape or the ruins of a building, but no one is near, and a photo on an outstretched hand is not an option at all!  Then the following application would be useful for you: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9d/9f8/832/c9d9f8832e4a7b580a4db154510898f2.png"><br>  <i><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dit.cameraclick.com">The only application I have installed</a> does almost the same thing, but the clock doesn‚Äôt see what is in the frame until the time it was taken.</i> <br><br><h5>  Fifth </h5><br>  Soon the end of the school year, and this application will be relevant, because almost everyone who studies has exams, the purpose of which is not clear, the essence is not clear, but the test is required: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eab/40f/9af/eab40f9af2aa4598e7df26eb24862f5e.png"><br><br><h5>  Sixth </h5><br>  Sorry, there is no microphone in the watch, then it would be possible to look like 007, communicating something with a clever view of the dial.  And so - only through the headset or the phone itself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a22/246/b8d/a22246b8d55baf9fd43ffb560e5bea2b.png"><br><br><h5>  Seventh </h5><br>  Well, how can it be without games? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/733/4fe/7dc/7334fe7dcc033fa6b2bf407b671e2d17.png"><br><br>  There were also ideas of interaction in the opposite direction, that is, not controlling the phone through the clock, but rather controlling the clock through the phone, such as: a) vibration call - put the clock without the strap on the girl, for example, under the seat, and then scare by starting the vibration from the phone, but Considering that the buzz is the same as the phone, most likely, it will not be scary, but there will be a long search for a vibrating phone ‚Äúalthough I have mine in my hands‚Äù;  b) displaying pictures on the clock screen - but there was no idea why.  Except maybe a wrist mini photo frame.  But further delusional ideas such direction of study has not led anywhere. <br><br>  That's all that I wanted to tell.  Each of these applications, be it in the Googlemarket, I would personally install and feel the joy of using the Sony SmartWatch.  But they are not there ... <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> ideas are distributed for free use, in the hope that someone will implement them :) <br><br>  <b>PPS:</b> if you want to actually implement the software side of applications, then you can cooperate.  For my part, I‚Äôm ready to seriously work on the visual part of applications (interface, icons, etc.), as now they are just quick sketches of concepts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174201/</a></p>
