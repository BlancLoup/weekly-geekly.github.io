Introduction: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149457/">habrahabr.ru/post/149457</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/robotex/" class="user_link">Robotex</a> <br>  <i>In the comments to the previous post many different versions broke out regarding the colonization of Mars.</i>  <i>This article contains more detailed information about each point of the upcoming mission, so that you can finally strengthen your point of view on this issue.</i> <br><br><h4>  About Mars One </h4><br>  Mars One is a private organization whose mission is to establish a colony on Mars using ready-made technologies.  This is the first project that plans to finance such a global operation through TV broadcasts in real time, starting with the selection of astronauts on Earth and ending <a name="habracut"></a>  solving complex technical problems on the surface of Mars. <br><br><h4>  Goals </h4><br>  Many people believe that the desire to explore the solar system is a far more important achievement for all of humanity than the local desires of individual nations.  Like Apollo's landing on the moon, the human mission on Mars will make it clear to our generations that anything is possible in this world.  The Mars One team believes not only in the <i>possibility of</i> this mission, but also in the fact that they <i>must</i> do everything possible to accelerate our understanding of the formation of space, the origin of life, and, last but not least, our sense of existence in the universe.

    <h4>  Working mission </h4><br>  In 2011, the creation of the first plans began.  During the first year, negotiations were held with many space agencies and corporations to test this idea for strength.  Response letters contained a deep interest in the project. <br>  Since it would be too expensive for corporations, and too risky for government enterprises, Mars One decided to take the path of integrating individual branches of existing technologies. <br><br><h4>  Technology </h4><br>  The plan is based on the current technologies from reliable suppliers.  The project itself is not an aerospace company and does not produce the equipment necessary for the mission.  All equipment will be developed by third parties and then combined into a single unit. <br>  The complete mission kit will contain the following: <br><ul><li>  Launcher.  This type of rocket will be used to deliver payload from earth to orbit (or from orbit to Mars).  It is planned to use the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket (an improved version of the Falcon 9, which SpaceX is currently using). </li><li>  Martian transit module.  The module will be responsible for delivering astronauts to Mars.  It will consist of two fuel systems, a landing system and accommodation facilities. </li><li>  The lander.  The Mars One team suggests using the advanced version of DragonCapsule, which was first tested in 2010. This is the same capsule that successfully docked with the ISS (International Space Station) in May 2012.  The Martian mission will require its slightly expanded model, which will include: <br>  Life support module in which air, water and energy generation systems will be located <br>  Power module that will contain food <br>  The module of the biosphere, which will store special inflatable sections that will allow you to create large living areas on the surface of Mars <br>  Travel module in which astronauts will spend seven months before landing on the planet <br>  Rover module </li></ul><br><h4>  Mars rovers </h4><br>  In the role of the rover is planned to use a large semi-autonomous system with solar power, whose tasks will include: <br><ul><li>  Intelligence service </li><li>  Quick collection of small vehicles </li><li>  Transportation of large hardware components </li><li>  General assembly of large structures </li></ul>  Thus, it will be more likely not a rover (in our usual sense), but a mobile factory on wheels. <br><br><h4>  Martian costume </h4><br>  All cosmonauts will have to wear suits when they are in contact with the Martian atmosphere.  Like those used on the moon, the suits will protect astronauts from extreme temperatures, thin airless atmosphere and harmful radiation. <br><br><h4>  Communication system </h4><br>  The system will transmit video streams along the chain Mars - communications satellite - Earth <br><br><h4>  Mankind on mars </h4><br>  Tell you about something like this - ‚Äúwe are going to fly to Mars for permanent life‚Äù - you will have questions: <br><ul><li>  How can astronauts leave Earth?  This is crazy! </li><li>  How will they prepare for life on Mars? </li><li>  What can happen in seven months of travel? </li><li>  What will astronauts do when they are away from home? </li></ul><br>  Let's try to answer these questions, and not only. <br><br><h4>  Emigration to mars </h4><br>  It is always more profitable to buy a one-way ticket than to take care of the return journey, but what do astronauts think about this?  Everything will depend on who to ask.  It is easy to see that most people would rather lose their leg than stay on a cold, dangerous planet, saying ‚Äúbye-bye‚Äù to their whole family and friends, and knowing that they will never face them again after the Spartan journey to the Red Planet.  However, there are people for whom traveling to Mars is an old long-standing dream.  They are ready to meet with the planet one on one.  For them, this is a unique opportunity to explore a new world, to conduct hitherto unexplored experiments, build a new home for Humanity and come face to face with the Unknown. <br>  Team Mars One will provide an opportunity to replenish the ranks of astronauts each.  Are you the one who dreams of this?  Then read on to find out what awaits you!  Would you rather lose your foot than go on such an adventure?  Read on and make sure you make the right choice! <br><br><h4>  Training </h4><br>  Each astronaut will participate in a mandatory ten-year training.  It will include numerous fitness tests in a group of four.  These tests will be conducted in a confined space for several months.  The purpose of this is to understand how a certain person reacts to close proximity with the rest of the team.  In addition to this, the colonialists must learn many new skills.  In the end, these people will be responsible for every aspect of the Martian colony: repairs, growing crops, as well as for many different medical trifles such as fractures.  (dubious phenomenon in the conditions of Martian gravity. <i>Approx. translator</i> ) <br><br><h4>  One way travel </h4><br>  The flight will take seven months.  The astronauts will spend all this time in a very small space - much smaller than the main base will provide, moreover, without much luxury and excesses.  This will not be an easy task.  The shower is not included in the program in advance - only wet wipes, as among visitors to the International Space Station.  The main friends of the astronauts at this time are canned meat, constant fan noise and a three-hour warm-up.  Against this background, hitting the sunstorm will be a significant adventure - you can pan up a bit and hide in the solar protection compartment for a couple of days.  There is no doubt that the trip will be tough, but astronauts will endure - after all, this is a trip to their dream (a dream can be translated as a dream, including in a negative context. <i>Comment of the translator</i> ). <br><br><h4>  Living on Mars </h4><br>  Upon arrival on Mars, the astronauts will be settled in more comfortable rooms (50 square meters per person, with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã200 for the whole team).  These premises will be based on inflatable components - a bedroom, a work area, a living room, a greenhouse for growing greenery.  Thanks to these components, colonists will be able to take a shower like all normal people, cook fresh food, wear ordinary clothes and lead a normal lifestyle.  The whole complex will be connected by a network of moves, but if someone wants to leave the base - he will need to wear a special suit.  Installing a residential complex does not take much time, and as soon as the problem is solved, you can proceed to construction and research. <br><br><h4>  Construction and research </h4><br>  Several basic life support modules will arrive on Mars along with the first squad of settlers.  The team‚Äôs task will also include preparing modules for the following groups of people.  All new modules from Earth will gradually connect to the main base.  Some of them will be duplicated to ensure greater security and just for comfort.  After some time, the colonists will have to take care of building additional housing from local materials. <br>  The planet will be rich in the amount of research required.  Astronauts will begin to study the influence of Mars on plants and their own bodies, to solve many geological and biological problems.  Who knows, in their free time, they might think: was there life on Mars before them? <br><br><h4>  Live broadcasts and television </h4><br>  All the activities of astronauts will be broadcast in real time to Earth.  You can be aware of all the recent events (the response time is about half an hour, without adjusting for the size of the data of the <i>translator</i> ), and also occasionally listen to the stories of astronauts who will definitely have something to say.  What happens when you go to the surface?  What is the "participate in the adventure"?  What is it - to experience gravity, which is only 40% of the earth?  Answers to these and many other questions will be received very soon. <br><br><h4>  Expansion </h4><br>  New groups of people are planned to land on Mars every two years.  The size of the settlement will steadily grow.  A little later, many residential units will be completed using local materials, so they will be large enough for a comfortable stay.  An increase in settlement will also have a beneficial effect on the condition of the colonists, since they will have opportunities for social life along with hard work. <br><br><h4>  Is it true that this is really possible? </h4><br>  Mars One is not the first organization that dreamed of ideas about human flight to Mars.  Many had similar plans.  And yet, no success followed.  Why should Mars One succeed? <br><br><h4>  Emigration </h4><br>  Travel to Mars is a one-way trip.  This radically changes the requirements for the mission, completely eliminating the need for the return of equipment to Earth, which leads to a sharp decrease in the cost of flight.  Mars will become a new home for the colonists, in which they will live and work, probably for the rest of their days. <br>  Although there is a small opportunity to return home, you should not think about it seriously.  To return a person to Earth, it will take several built and fully fueled rockets, each of which will be able to carry out a round trip with a total duration of 14 months.  It will cost significantly more than one way. <br>  In addition, do not forget about gravity.  After several years of living on Mars, a person will be unable to return to Earth.  This is due to irreversible physiological changes in the body, such as a decrease in bone density, loss of muscle strength and a decrease in the potential of the circulatory system.  Even after a short journey to the Mir station, the astronauts rose to their feet within two years, what can we say about Mars. <br>  Thus, subject to permanent residence on Mars, all problems are reduced to providing the foundations for life: clean air, drinking water, food, and artificial support for plant growth (for the first time) <br>  Although all this sounds complicated, in fact, the Mars One project can be implemented today.  Mankind already has the necessary technology.  Many of the data obtained from past cosmic experiments may be applicable to this mission. <br>  In addition, Mars contains some necessary elements and fossils.  For the first settlement, for example, a place is chosen that contains water ice in the soil.  This water can be used for drinking, bathing, watering fodder crops, as well as for creating oxygen.  Mars has natural sources of nitrogen - the main element of which is in the air (80%) - we breathe. <br><br><h4>  Solar panels </h4><br>  Using this simple, reliable and abundant source of energy, it is possible to completely abandon the development and launch of a nuclear reactor, while saving time and money, and reducing the risk of use.  Solar panels will be a good light source of energy - because the colony does not need heavy fuels to launch rockets back.  The first settlement will have to cover an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 3000 square meters with solar panels.  Although Mars is significantly farther from the Sun than the Earth, it has a more subtle atmosphere.  As a result of this compensation, a sufficient amount of energy gets to the surface - about 500 W per square meter (to the Earth - 1000 W).  In the early years, the batteries will be located exclusively on the surface of the planet.  As the power decreases due to dust deposits, a special robot will clean them. <br><br><h4>  Simple mars rovers </h4><br>  Thanks to the use of relatively simple rovers, money is saved that could have been spent on developing more complex systems.  Were selected such machines, which, although they allow you to comfortably move around the territory, but are not able to maintain the atmosphere and pressure inside your body - this will become a concern for Martian costumes.  This choice is optimal, as it significantly reduces the cost of development and delivery.  The rover will allow astronauts to travel up to 80 kilometers per day.  In fact, the matter is not in the rover - the battery on board contains a significant amount of energy - but the suits, alas, are not designed for work longer than 8 hours.  The speed of the rover will not exceed 10 km per hour under direct control and will be even less with automatic.  Although it seems too small, in a year it will turn out to explore about 5,000 square kilometers (when calculating, consider the viewing distance and the corresponding changes in the route. <i>Approx. Translator</i> ).  Do not forget also that we are talking about the plant-on-wheels rover. <br><br><h4>  Lack of new developments </h4><br>  The whole plan revolves around the use of realistic, time-tested technologies.  Even if any component is not in stock - it is only a small matter of time, because there is no need for a fundamental change in the details.  All suppliers have confirmed their willingness to build the necessary components right now. <br><br><h4>  No policy </h4><br>  The only selection criterion is the balance of price and quality.  The project is not interested in the supplier‚Äôs nation.  This distinguishes it from large corporations, which dictate their foreign and domestic policy on the basis of many personal factors.  Does this provide substantial guarantees of good quality and price?  Not! <br><br>  Thus, the theoretical basis for the start is quite ready.  What awaits us next?  Time will tell. <br>  Based on materials from the <a href="http://mars-one.com/">official site of the</a> project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151624/</a></p>
