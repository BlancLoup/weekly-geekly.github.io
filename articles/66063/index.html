Why scream about it all over Ivanovo? .. Find a counterpart that will suit you. </blockquote><br><br>  Of course, we all know that free cheese is only in a mousetrap (according to this wisdom, all users of free software will end their days under a metal rod with a broken neck).

      But at the same time there is an elementary culture of market relations, there are also laws.  Our culture is amazingly underdeveloped, so even the legal framework that exists does not work. <br><br>  So, it does not matter at all whether you paid for something or not (unless, of course, you stole it).  In any case, there is a contract between the parties, part of which are advertising promises and information about the product or service. <br><br>  For example, in the framework of any advertising campaign you are given a mug.  It is obvious that you can drink from it, that its material and paint do not interact with the contents, etc.  That is, you are sure that you can drink from a free mug, just like from any other.  And if this is not the case, you can sue the donor.  Because the mug itself is a promise that it can be used as a mug, unless otherwise stated (for example, it is an exclusively decorative structure made of toxic materials).  Otherwise, it will be a deliberate misrepresentation of the consumer. <br><br>  Another example.  Volunteer or social work, for example, as a doctor or psychologist.  This service is free for consumers, and in the case of volunteering zp  providing service is also not paid. <br><br>  Now imagine that free medical care is provided not by a doctor who has received a special education, but simply by a local lunatic who has nothing to do.  He does not treat you, but cripples.  Your legal claims are answered: what did you want for free?  go look for another free honey.  help, just do not like what you died from ours. <br><br>  Examples are not accidental, since free software can be interpreted as a manufacturer's advertisement (oh, you wrote such good software, and make it for us for money), as a promotional gift for the purpose of selling other products (want to know how to use our free cheese? Pay technical support!), as volunteer activities of programmers (I want to benefit people without demanding anything in return). <br><br>  So here. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is a mug, we give it to you for free‚Äù - this is information about the product and certain promises regarding it that need to be fulfilled. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is a red cross, we treat you for free‚Äù - this is information about the service and promises about its quality that need to be fulfilled. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is [such and such] software‚Äù is information about the product, meaning that the software must meet [such and such] expectations. <br><br>  That is, for example, if the manufacturer says that this is an office suite, and when you start on the screen, the bunny just jumps, then this is at least a violation of culture, and in certain circumstances a violation of the law. <br><br>  Imagine a situation where in the bazaar a hundred people are yelling, for example, ‚Äúfree office‚Äù, but in fact it turns out that in 98 cases they are tattered sandals and leaky samovars.  It would be extremely difficult for you to find in such conditions what you need.  And the liars from the bazaar would be banished so that others would not be disturbed by the work. <br><br>  Free software, as soon as it identified itself as a specific type of software and began to make other promises to the user, explicit or hidden, no longer has the right not to fulfill the promises or cause direct damage to the user, justifying itself with its free of charge. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66063/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66063/</a></p>
