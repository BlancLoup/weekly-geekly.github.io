  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to start to appreciate every passing day?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In many books on personal effectiveness, the basic principles include setting long-term goals and the ability to take responsibility for your life (just recall Stephen Covey's Seven Skills of Highly Effective People).  However, in reality, it is not always possible to motivate yourself, and planning becomes another burdensome task.  What to do and why, like you know.  And to force oneself to perform the routine and, at times, very unpleasant work day by day, it is impossible to overcome difficulties.  Sometimes even the busiest days do not bring satisfaction, and once again you realize that something in my life is going wrong. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Recently, once again reflecting on my own existence, I suddenly realized that almost every day of mine does not carry any significance for life as a whole.  I will come to work, fulfill my duties with high quality, maybe I will have time to work out something interesting and solve a couple of personal problems, but what‚Äôs next.  Tomorrow everything will be repeated again and the day after tomorrow and the day after tomorrow ... It turns out a kind of vicious circle.  The next day has no value, even if I have time to do everything planned.  Of course, by being active even in a routine, you can improve your life as a whole, but it is very difficult to maintain zeal at a constantly high level. <br><br>  I thought: how to motivate yourself.  After analyzing the last few months of my life, I remembered that there was a short period (a couple of months), when every day was important for me, when I went to bed, I was happy to think about plans for tomorrow.  It was a period of work on their own business project.  We met with partners every week, discussed, planned, set goals, gave each other commitments.  And every day, coming to work, I eagerly carried out the basic plan for the day, and the remaining time was engaged in our project.  The motivation for me was the meaning of what I was doing.  I knew that in a month (two, three, five) there will be a result and it will really mean for me and my life.  And each passing day gained value.  Many more important factors for productive work can be gleaned from this story: planning, mutual obligations, global business, etc.  But the most important thing is the idea that the day should make sense, bring it closer to the goal, be meaningful for life in general. <br><br>  Ultimately, I formulated a principle that will help get rid of the routine and motivate myself to a truly effective life.

      So.  When planning every day, it is necessary to allocate time for solving at least one task that will bring a very significant personal Goal closer.  The most important thing is that the goal should be really important and the solved task should bring it closer.  The definition of true personal goals and the formulation of tasks is beyond the scope of this article, on this occasion a huge amount of good literature has already been written.  In order to determine how correctly the Goal is chosen and the task is set, it is enough to imagine that the day has passed and the task is completed.  Now this day makes sense, could you throw it out of life as easy as your usual routine?  If the answer is no, then everything is done correctly and you can enjoy life. <br><br>  Using this approach, we can not only motivate ourselves, but also change our lives in a positive way by achieving fundamental goals for which so little time is often spent on a daily basis. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53403/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53403/</a></p>
