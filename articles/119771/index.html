  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Organizing the sale of unnecessary things</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surely, many people have a ton of unnecessary junk lying around the house, which doesn't seem to be necessary, but it's a shame to throw it out.  For example, I treat such people quite a lot - a lot of things that would be good to fuse.  I would like to sell it off cheaply, but I don‚Äôt have any desire to be engaged in the preparation of announcements, accommodation, haemorrhoids with a meeting with the buyer (or sending parcels).  There are still quite a lot of positions.  Among the junk, there is naturally any computer hardware and it can be simply attributed to the hucksters on the market, but the key phrase ‚Äúhucksters on the market‚Äù is somewhat confusing and I don‚Äôt want to go to them.  In addition, not all things belong to the computer and simply carry it nowhere. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This idea was born - a kind of online antique store that takes on all the above mentioned crap.  Those.  <b>The key point is not buying a product</b> , but it takes on the entire process of selling junk. <br>  Of course, there is a problem of storage - junk needs to be stored somewhere, but here two options appear: <br>  1) The product is stored in stock for moderate loot with daily billing. <br>  2) The product is kept at home with the client until the buyer is found. <br>  There is also the problem of writing descriptions.  Here you can also come up with various types of schemes - the buyer photographs the goods on their own according to the specified method, brings (or sends photos), sends a description (or asks to make it to the store on the basis of a verbal story).  You can also bring the goods to the store and leave it there.  Specially trained people will prepare a description and post an ad (on their website, or on well-known online auctions - this is by agreement with the client already).  After the buyer is found, there are again options: <br>  1) the buyer takes the goods to the store, from where the goods are delivered to the buyer by the store, <br>  2) the seller himself takes the goods to the buyer, <br>  3) the buyer himself comes for the goods. <br><br>  I personally hardly see any drawbacks, except that the business case here, of course, still needs to be considered, because it can turn out to be unprofitable when taking into account reasonable prices for services. <br>  The pros are probably understandable to everyone, although naturally there are reservations - for example, if the price of a product is less than half the cost of a service - it makes no sense to sell it anymore, but such a product is easier to throw away, although you can come up with a kind of a flea market for such goods, but There is a question of a warehouse. </div>
