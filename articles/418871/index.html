It‚Äôs easy to imagine a situation when two people talk about drinking vitamin C to prevent a cold;  but the dialogue that special balls, etc., are used to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor, etc., is already more difficult. <br><br>  Similar topics are raised individually in medical offices, but this remains mostly behind closed doors and closed medical card covers.  But the dialogues guarded by medical secrecy are sometimes the reason why a person does not pay attention to this or that problem for a long time: despair, it seems, that this is just me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xi/0s/he/xi0shewdjabpjzmnwangq--whms.jpeg">

      Well, we will risk talking about what is usually not talked about. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For 70 years, the name of the American gynecologist Arnold Kegel has become a household name thanks to his discoveries and observations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bw/rv/ka/bwrvkasplk7_pqxc6_uzenzi_ds.jpeg"><br><br>  The main one was that, thanks to him, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineometer">Perineometer</a> created was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineometer">able</a> to establish that the intimate muscles inevitably weaken for a number of reasons: from natural (age, birth) to acquired (trauma, etc.). <br><br>  Considering his experience, including surgery, Kegel noticed that operations did not give proper results, and, perhaps, for the first time stated the importance of conservative methods and prophylaxis, and also proposed a set of measures, now known as " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F">Kegel exercises</a> ." <br><br>  When we last <a href="https://habr.com/company/medgadgets/blog/380753/">raised</a> this topic, we turned to a doctor for advice, and we were generally confirmed that the value of this method is still quite high and this is probably the only painless, comfortable and conservative way! <br><br>  Are there any others?  Yes, definitely.  One of them is electrostimulation.  In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC27740/">one study</a> , it was decided to compare the effectiveness, and the Kegel exercises showed a better result than electric current.  At the same time, again, they can be considered a less ‚Äúdisturbing‚Äù or more natural way. <br><br>  Allow me, but for Kegel exercises it is not necessary to use an additional accessory?  In general - yes, but in this case, the training will occur without feedback, any self-control. <br><br>  Of course, fast results can not be expected: as noted in some publications, the first real results can be felt 4-6 weeks after systematic classes 1-2 times a day.  At the same time, Arnold Kegel himself used the same Perineometer to determine the pressure force, which, it seems, speaks rather in favor of additional ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù. <br><br>  Be that as it may, in spite of the visual affinity with sex toys, despite the place where the simulator is used, it is still medicine, and the pleasure here is much less than systematic labor and exertion. <br><br>  The problem is that the mentality of our population is organized in such a way that prevention is not for us.  We cannot force ourselves to sit straight to avoid problems with the spine, we cannot force ourselves to go to the dentist every six months, we cannot force ourselves to donate blood until the roasted rooster bites.  What can we say about forcing yourself to squeeze and unclench something there that can manifest itself in a few years after-datsat! <br><br>  <b>And what can happen?</b> <br><br>  Among the main effects of weak muscle tone of the pelvic floor are called: <br><br><ul><li>  urinary incontinence with effort (trite: when coughing or lifting weights) </li><li>  emergency incontinence - when the desire to empty the bladder (when it is not overfilled!) is so strong that the person does not have time to reach the restroom </li><li>  Postpartum weakening of the muscles - which can cause the omission of one of the organs of the small pelvis, such as the uterus. </li></ul><br>  There may also be several reasons: <br><br><blockquote>  The natural is referred to as "temporary": any muscles weaken with age.  Also, tonus reduction is affected by surgery, pregnancy and childbirth.  Obesity. </blockquote><br>  <b>So why do you need Elvie?</b> <br><br>  The Kegel smart simulator performs several important functions: <br><br><ul><li>  Feedback, monitoring and training reminders </li><li>  Teaching.  In fact, the set of exercises is not so difficult, but all the same, it‚Äôs much easier to act on prompts. </li><li>  Teaching: Elvie software is interactive </li></ul><br>  But first things first! <br><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br><br>  The design of the device also came to us partly from the intimate sphere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mg/ut/rr/mgutrrpq-vqgdn8rvqrh9i-licy.jpeg"><br><br>  The gadget, given the place of use, is completely sealed and there are no holes here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mn/gc/yr/mngcyrcmoqtc-ydnxrfacgvzyc0.gif"><br><br>  It is charged with a special docking station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7a/8w/by/7a8wbylnv0v7kcxyemfeymicoey.gif"><br><br>  Here on one side of the case is a microUSB connector.  The time to full charge is declared - about 1 hour, and Elvie will work in training mode for up to 30 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1a/mo/sw/1amoswhkvhr_pvpg7ur1wg4v5fw.jpeg"><br><br>  It also serves as a container for transportation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wz/ps/8o/wzps8okiglhfaren7-a28izqjkq.jpeg"><br><br>  In fact, one of the advantages that manufacturers note is that the simulator is compact and delicately packed, and you can easily take it with you, without attracting attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xf/bp/_1/xfbp_1ub1nrmyndznagysvnxxjm.gif"><br><br>  The complete set of the device includes instructions, a simulator, a special nozzle-enlarger and a cable for charging the gadget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gx/6p/5i/gx6p5ieieqgqavdddcvnokdaiww.jpeg"><br><br>  Both the gadget and the attachment are made of silicone without the addition of rubber and latex, which should rule out any discomfort, for example, allergic reactions to the same latex, which are very common. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wc/ix/9s/wcix9sr-vsvgoq6_fyf4-eljwue.jpeg"><br><br>  To eliminate the "loss" of the device inside the body, a "tail" is provided. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y8/ab/_p/y8ab_pgqyugmp8u7lqc74ulppma.jpeg"><br><br>  It can not be called long enough, but it is impossible to lose. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">It's all decent, but nonetheless</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l1/1b/sa/l11bsas-fclzk6nqghzl9tajvz4.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  At the same time, despite the fact that he ‚Äúholds the shape‚Äù, he is soft and flexible, there is no steel rod there, and such a tail will not crush, rub, deliver some discomfort, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8f/vn/43/8fvn43d-mbudybzjaewvejq5kxk.gif"><br><br>  In general, the impressions of the use are positive, and the device is made quite well outside, so perhaps the only thing that can cause some complaints - again, given the closed use space - sometimes loses touch with the smartphone, but quickly recovers. <br><br>  <b>What about content?</b> <br><br>  The gadget works in tandem with the application ( <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elvie-kegel-pelvic-floor-trainer-for-women/id963138902%3Fmt%3D8">IOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.uk.elvie%26hl%3Dru">Android</a> ).  Functionally and visually, they are no different. <br><br>  When registering, of course, you will be asked to calibrate the profile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cq/r_/as/cqr_asrgll0fjuh7gyruy8_hm4i.png"><br><br>  Here you can also define the ‚Äúreadiness level‚Äù to select the appropriate level.  In this case, the device acts as the very ‚Äúgadget‚Äù that Kegel invented: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sp/on/hd/sponhdr1qvlylk46kmd1ntvzvxu.gif"><br><br><blockquote>  Self-testing takes place in several parameters: Effort, Pulsation, Compression, Hold, Speed, Ladder. </blockquote><br>  You can then select a workout mode: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vk/_b/fm/vk_bfmalkn076fwp4lp0cp_xdse.png"><br><br>  What is expected at each level can be seen in the short abstract description: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i9/ou/fx/i9oufxzw9ftkqhg9tbuynqxca-q.jpeg"><br><br>  And then, perhaps, the most valuable thing Elvie offers.  It is necessary to understand that any training is always an effort, and our body most often wants to relax and rest.  Those who forced themselves to go jogging in the morning or in the evening - probably will confirm to the gym that they always want to postpone, move, etc. <br><br>  Trainings with Elvie are arranged in such a way that they seem to be dragging on, they want to be repeated, because they are performed in a game form.  Somewhere you need to get into a cloud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1n/t1/pa/1nt1payvdzp8ezaduds5nx54iqm.gif"><br><br>  Somewhere to train for accuracy in successive hit on round targets: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6f/lz/4z/6flz4zu1a8li6y2n6tccvexvmcq.gif"><br><br>  Or for a while to keep the pearl in the circle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jg/vr/bh/jgvrbhryagm8fcyvv5fmfwm8qje.gif"><br><br>  This is pretty cool and motivating.  For example, if you did not hit all the targets, then you want to "replay" or next time make the best result.  Moreover, after each stage of the training, the person immediately sees his progress: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0g/6g/g9/0g6gg9hkdrhbuuwjn-c-5zatxvu.gif"><br><br>  Gamification, even in such a sensitive topic, is a great solution.  It is both distracting, entertaining and motivating to improve the result, and some ‚Äúsubstitution of concepts‚Äù takes place.  Above the user does not hang gloomy thoughts about the problems, and the task is just to drive the pearl into the target! <br><br>  Statistics is available in the application in the form of graphs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qa/6l/d2/qa6ld2ja0snn6jd-5x0uifahcsq.png"><br><br>  Here you can see in detail the results of each stage of the training: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ir/pi/up/irpiupcudut_3j6nftoy9gaanv0.jpeg"><br><br>  Moreover, statistics are stored in the cloud, and when switching between devices under one login, it does not disappear anywhere.  The same, for example, can be viewed on Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yj/2s/u8/yj2su8-b4uugujwwyaxd9wrz0wy.jpeg"><br><br>  Additionally, it is worth noting the reminder system  The application allows you to set and goal training, and time alerts that it is time to start classes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ys/ly/29/ysly290liv9gevrwtyrwanyx7gg.jpeg"><br><br>  For those who are interested in buying Elvie (and he is <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/trenazher-elvie.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dkegel%26utm_campaign%3Delvie">not the cheapest</a> ), we can offer a discount of 10% according to the govt: <b>HBRKEGEL</b> .  Until the end of October. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8p/ud/h6/8pudh6px1ddw6wr8-3oy0a8k7yu.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418871/</a></p>
