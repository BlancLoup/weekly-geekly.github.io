CapsLock is probably used to ensure that there is no doubt that we are really dealing with a state structure.  )) <br><br>  For greater persuasiveness in the header of the ‚Äúsite‚Äù the huge logo shines ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/65a/d0b/21b/65ad0b21b9c077f982e7f60173ecbe17.gif" width="450" height="67" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the letter, links to the site for some reason are ‚Äútrimmed‚Äù by link conversion services.  Probably, customs sending me this letter was worried that I could pass on their address to my friends on Twitter. <br><blockquote>  &gt; Catalog: <br>  <a href="http://shurl.net/bil">shurl.net/bil</a> <br>  <a href="http://yatuc.com/cn5">yatuc.com/cn5</a> </blockquote><br>  And for some reason they lead not to the <a href="http://www.customs.ru/ru/">site of Russian customs</a> , but to the Chinese blog-hosting resource <a href="http://98.to/Sota/%3F98041">98.to.</a>

      Since the customs officers are honest and honest, the reason for the confiscation of the goods is also indicated directly in the header.  Surely, in order to prevent people from suspecting that all this, God forbid, was not chosen in an honest way. <br><blockquote>  WE OFFER MOBILE TELEPHONES AND KPK CONFISCED ON CUSTOMS TERMINALS.  THE ENTIRE PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY NEW, IN A FACTORY PACKAGE, FULLY RUSSIFIED.  <strong>THE CAUSE OF CONFISCATION IS A DECREASE OF THE COST OF THE IMPORTED CARGO.</strong>  ORDERS ARE ACCEPTED COMPLETELY IN AUTOMATIC MODE. </blockquote><br><br>  Jokes, jokes, but there are people who do not even know about it.  How to think up methods of dealing with fraud in the internet.  Many of you will say that here they say, there are tens of thousands of such scams in runet and one more role will not play.  And I will say that you need to start small ... You need to start with yourself.  The small contribution of each of us can make the runet a little cleaner.  And to whom, if not us, people who understand what they are talking about and who possess computer skills. <br><br>  How many of us own site owners and blogs?  Hundreds?  Rather, thousands!  If not tens of thousands.  A small mention on the pages of your resources, such as offices, is enough, and the average user using Google or Yandex will be able to find information about the ‚Äúmiracle company‚Äù.  Yes, at least by the same name. <br><br>  What will it give you personally?  It may be the feeling that you did something useful and prevented a dozen fraudulent transactions with robbing people.  Perhaps the number of such one-day firms will decrease after some time, after the "witch hunt".  It is possible that nothing has changed.  But if you do not try, you will never know.  And it costs us nothing. <br><br>  <em>PS I would like to hear SEO specialists, is it possible to do all this in such a way that the same Google did not consider "anti-advertising" a reference to the source and did not raise such sites in the search engine rankings.</em> <br><br>  Pps <blockquote>  <strong><font color="red">3) YOU PAY THE AMOUNT EQUAL HALF OF THE COST OF YOUR ORDER.</font></strong> </blockquote><br>  <strong>You can read and forget about it, but you can try to somehow resist such a development of events.</strong>  <strong><u>"The flood begins with a drop."</u></strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27792/</a></p>
