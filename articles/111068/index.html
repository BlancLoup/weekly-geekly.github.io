  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On ‚Äúintellectual piracy‚Äù and copyright</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The idea is inspired by the article, a link to which you will find at the end of the story. <br>  And the thought itself is pretty simple: <br>  <b>‚ÄúThere is no‚Äú intellectual property ‚Äùin nature - it‚Äôs a myth!‚Äù</b> <br>  And talk a little about this ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prerequisites </h4><h5>  Where do thoughts come from? </h5>  It was always interesting to me!  If the memory mechanism, i.e., the principle of memory functioning in the cerebral cortex, presumably functions associatively, then it becomes all the more unclear how exactly non-existent associations are formed, i.e. own thoughts, so-called, own point of view, etc. .  Well, if even more or less everything is clear with the writing of the tabloid reading book ‚Äî a stupid presentation of certain images, then with the versification there are already difficulties in explaining this phenomenon.  And if we consider the area purely intellectual, for example, mathematics, then in general there is a ‚Äúdark forest‚Äù. <br><h5>  How to explain the coincidence of thoughts in completely different people? </h5>  This phenomenon with the development of the Internet and the increased, thanks to him, the flow of information began to occur a thousand times more often than it was, say, a little more than a century ago, when several different and unfamiliar people independently of each other, while speaking different languages, and, naturally, living in different countries, invented the radio or something else.  Today, even with me there were repeatedly instances of coincidence of ideas by 99% like mine!  Is it a joke ?! <br><h6>  History example </h6>  At the beginning of the 20th century, G. Ford (the founder of the Ford Motors Automobile Corporation) encountered the system of "copyright protection" when he proved in court his right to produce cars against the patent issued in the name of a certain G. S√∂lden in 1879.  I quote: ‚ÄúMany technicians, including me, who had been designing cars for many years, found out with amazement one day that the development of a self-propelled crew was protected by a patent many years ago, although the patent applicant indicated only an idea and did nothing in its sense practical implementation ‚Äù(G.Ford,‚Äú My life, my achievements, ‚Äùch. 3.‚Äú The real work begins ‚Äù). <br>  And if you develop this topic, you can also ask a number of questions that have no answer, at first glance.  I will briefly say that they have no answer in classical science, but there are hypotheses, and so far I only know the only one that gives the answer to all my questions.  The remaining hypotheses are somehow all by themselves and give explanations only to particulars. <br><br><h4>  Reasoning </h4>  So, if different people make the same inventions independently of each other, <b>on what basis should one</b> (and any of them) <b>have the right to be its author, and the other not?</b>  I have been thinking about this question for a long time, and it caused an association with the question: What is the size of the universe?  You can measure for a long time, but the answer is always the same: Human values ‚Äã‚Äãdo not convey this value.  By the standards of man, the universe is infinite!  In the same way, in my understanding, the question of authorship also looks, that is, at the limit, absolutely all people possess authorship for any product of the intellectual activity of any other person, or, equivalently, none of the people have authorship.  Or on the worker-peasant: if you were the first to say something, this does not mean that no one thought the same thing before you, but did not speak for some internal reason, or that if you didn‚Äôt say that, after you, no one else would have thought of it before!  Or, for example, assessing the situation with the category of ‚Äúforumchanin‚Äù the very concept of ‚Äúauthorship‚Äù is akin to the post of ‚Äúpervona‚Äù. <br>  Yes, the author is well done, that the first expressed some wonderful idea!  You can give him a prize for it, for example, the Nobel, if the thought is worthwhile (‚Äútake the pie from the shelf‚Äù)!  And let it serve him as an incentive for further work in the same vein.  But there can be no talk of any ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù!  Because I, like any other person in my right mind, do not see him, I do not feel with my own sense organs!  Dialectical materialism in all its glory is a whole trend in philosophy!  Not huhry-mukhry! <br>  One more fact for all people is obvious, but for some reason ignored with enviable constancy, I quote and focus attention in the text on the words I have highlighted: <br>  ‚ÄúToday, there <b>is a</b> lot of big money <b>in the field of protecting intellectual property rights</b> .  The television channel Vesti 24 (May 13, 2010) reported that the ‚ÄúProducers of the movie‚Äú The Lord of the Storm ‚Äùare preparing a lawsuit against tens of thousands of people who downloaded the film from the Internet.‚Äù  It turns out that even five months before the official premiere of the film, its pirated copy appeared on the Web.  In the rental film collected a total of 16 million dollars.  ‚ÄúThis is probably why the company that financed the shooting signed a contract with the Washington US Copyright Group (copyright group), which in early March filed lawsuits against more than 50,000 people for downloading five independent producers from the Network.  ‚ÄúWith this gesture, the organization declared itself on the market as a player who took over the entire anti-piracy chain from monitoring file hosting services to receiving compensation from users.‚Äù <br>  However, being a commercial project, <b>a copyright group uses lawsuits only to put people in front of the fact of prosecution, to frighten people with huge fines and wean them from file sharing, that is, to offer them "to agree in a good way."</b> <br>  ... <br>  In tightening the US copyright protection system ahead of the rest.  Absurd statements that the <b>user has not the right not only to copy, but even to read aloud the information from the text of the book is</b> possible only in the USA and even under the fear of criminal liability. ‚Äù <br>  In my opinion, comments are unnecessary ... <br><br>  And in connection with everything going on around the issue of ‚Äúcopyright and related rights‚Äù, well, one straightforward wedge in the head is one obvious conclusion: <br>  A <b>global information distribution management system is being created</b> in the world <b>on the basis of legislation on ‚Äúcopyright and related rights‚Äù</b> .  And the monopoly high solvency of some and the poverty of others that has developed in today's world allows: <br>  1) first, to legalize the institution of ‚Äúcopyright and related rights‚Äù under the pretext of allegedly protecting the interests of authors and financially ensuring the possibility of their receiving income from the exploitation of their works <i>(after all, in fact, the authors often receive much less than their publishers - owners of they are right, and if you take programmers, they are generally authoring for wages)</i> ; <br>  2) then this legislation and the practice of its application allows you to buy copyrights to works of art, inventions, scientific, technical and other information <i>(which is also not uncommon and, after looking closely, anyone will notice that this is happening to the works of geniuses)</i> ; <br>  3) and at this stage there is a system that allows you to control access to cultural achievements assigned in this way and, accordingly, to control the direction of cultural development, based on the dissemination of one information and the prosecution, of the distributors of the other under the pretext of allegedly infringing copyright and related rights.

    <h4>  I summarize </h4> So, replacing the supposedly protecting the interests of the creators of the new from parasitism on their creativity with the question of accessibility to people of all cultural achievements, the highly successful people of the world are made to possess new controls and control over society. <br><br>  But it can be hoped that the legislation on intellectual property in Russia for the next 10 years will not work and the fight against ‚Äúintellectual piracy‚Äù will not bring tangible results. <br>  Although, of course, it is best to resist this phenomenon consciously.  Moreover, there are much more convincing evidence that there is no and cannot be any ‚Äúintellectual property‚Äù than what it is.  Moreover, to come to this conclusion <u>, one textbook on logic is enough, but a lot of free time</u> is enough to arrange all the ‚Äúpoints above and‚Äù for yourself. <br><br>  Source of reasoning: <a href="http://www.kpe.ru/sobytiya-i-mneniya/ocenka-tendencii-s-pozicii-kob/1588-ob-intelectualnom-piratstve%3Ftmpl%3Dcomponent%26print%3D1%26layout%3Ddefault%26page%3D">Article "On" intellectual piracy "and copyright"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111068/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111068/</a></p>
