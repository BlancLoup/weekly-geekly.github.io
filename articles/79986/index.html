I replenished the account to the required 5 cu  and waited on December 31, when I can congratulate all my friends and relatives who do not live in my city.

    <h2>  Part 1: my attempts to get through at least somewhere ... </h2><br>  For communication, I used and installed the ActivX component under IE8 and the SipPoint special program from SIPNET.  And even had to install QIP Infium, with the plugin SIP. <br><br>  First, I checked the action on my phone, set up the microphone, the SipPoint program and checked the balance after the call.  Not removed a penny, then do not lie.  But as wisdom says - ‚Äúfree cheese only in a mousetrap‚Äù. <br>  I made one call to another city, <b>exactly 1 minute</b> I lost the connection, then I was disconnected.  I checked the balance - everything is fine, still more than 5 cu. <br><img src="http://www.imagepost.ru/images/QdFOACY.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All subsequent attempts to get through were unsuccessful.  SipPoint gave error number 408 and sometimes denial of service.  Well, I think the influx of subscribers - it happens.  Later tried again - without result. <br>  It was necessary to replenish the balance of the cell phone and start calling "in the old manner." <br><br>  I decided to look at the SIPNET website, what's the matter, maybe there is any news on the problem.  No news.  But there are a lot of messages created by other users who, like me, also could not get through. <br>  Classification of angry messages: <br><ul><li>  I can't do it ... </li><li>  there is no sound ... / they can't hear me ... / I can't hear ... </li></ul><br>  Here are screenshots of messages, for the administration is actively cleaning them (there is a reason to think) on the site. <br><br> <a href="http://www.imagepost.ru/%3Fv%3DPyctR49.jpg"><img src="http://www.imagepost.ru/images/PyctR49.jpg"></a> <br> <a href="http://imagepost.ru/%3Fv%3DKsqgUN9.jpg"><img src="http://imagepost.ru/images/KsqgUN9.jpg"></a> <br> <a href="http://imagepost.ru/%3Fv%3D8TpDb0y.jpg"><img src="http://imagepost.ru/images/8TpDb0y.jpg"></a> <br>  There are messages that thank for the action, but they are a minority and I am not sure that they were written by users, and not by the administration. <br><br>  Already on January 1, I made another attempt.  I will describe briefly: <br>  1. ActivX crashes IE8.  In compatibility mode is the same.  Reinstalling IE and the component did not lead to a positive result. <br>  2. QIP Infium called - but the SIPNET robot said that I had no money in my account and that I could not call until I replenished my balance. <br><br><h2>  Part 2: letters to tech support and their response that ‚Äúkilled me‚Äù ... </h2><br>  I wrote a letter to support@sipnet.ru, I quote: <br>  ‚Äú <i>I don‚Äôt want to call any number. Sippoint generally gives a server error and 408 error.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>For some reason, QIP Infium says that I have test access and that I need to replenish my account.</i>  <i>I have no test access for a long time.</i>  <i>I replenished a long time ago and called normally.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And now this action is your Free calls - and everything stopped calling.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It does not ring through the site - a critical Internet Explorer 8 error.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Your action failed in a crash, I read the messages of others on your site - they have solid problems too.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>What to do????</i>  " <br><br>  Answer from support@sipnet.ru I quote: <br>  " <i>As far as we can see from your statistics, you managed to call.</i> " <br><br>  Those.  they don‚Äôt want to help me, they just say: "- did you manage to call? it's wonderful." <br><br>  My following letters were simply ignored.  Did I deserve it? <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br><ul><li>  many attempts to get through: successfully only one, except for a test call to your number.  It was possible to talk only 1 minute instead of the promised - ‚Äú2 full days ...‚Äù </li><li>  Not only I had such problems, therefore the source is not on the client side </li><li>  answer tech support, as it were, sends the subscriber to the * n * th ... I did not expect this.  And ignoring customers is the height of arrogance. </li><li>  SIPNET was not ready for such a promotion, but could at least apologize and arrange some kind of bonus, as compensation? </li><li>  This did not spoil my mood on NG, but I made a conclusion for myself - the refund and the termination of using the service.  Search for alternatives. </li></ul><br>  I want to believe that SIPNET will think before you do anything.  I understand that I wanted to make a gift, but it did not work out - then you have to explain everything humanly and not allow this to happen in the future.  But they did only: <b>removal of angry messages and not wanting to help the subscriber ...</b> <br><br>  <b>upd:</b> transferred to the thematic blog <br><h6>  ‚ÄúReputation is created over the years, and you can lose it in a flash‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember who said </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79986/</a></p>
