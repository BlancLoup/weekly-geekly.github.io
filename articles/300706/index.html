Now, The Information publication <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/uber-outsourcing-infrastructure-to-public-cloud-2016-5">reports</a> that for the first time since its inception, Uber plans to transfer part of its own infrastructure to outsourcing.  As one of the largest customers in the market, Uber has already managed to receive cooperation offers from Google, Microsoft and Amazon, the market leaders in storing and processing data in the cloud. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Taking into account the work in 69 countries, Uber requires a fail-safe hosting for its application, which will be located as close as possible to the users of each country.  When choosing a suitable hosting Uber will certainly pay attention to the number of data centers located in close proximity to each of the countries in which the service operates - in a highly competitive environment every second is important during the ordering process.

      In fact, each of the options - from Amazon to Microsoft may be suitable for Uber, but a startup is most interested in hosting.  Due to the great popularity of Uber, as well as the active media coverage, any hosting company that chooses a startup will receive significant coverage in the media space.  Currently, Uber does not give preference to specific companies, which further complicates the forecasting of a transaction with any of them. <br><br>  The only obstacle may be the development of unmanned vehicles by Google - the company may enter the taxi market in the next few years with such a decision that will completely change the scope.  Accordingly, the management of Uber is unlikely to want to provide the competitor with additional information regarding the travels of its customers and not only.  By the way, Apple did not stop it, and the company transferred part of its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform. <br><br>  On the other hand, Uber's latest desire to enter the market for the delivery of various goods and services can compete with Amazon's offers, similar to Google, which makes it not the most attractive cloud service for a startup.  Despite this, Uber is likely to be guided solely by the speed of the cloud service, as well as the total cost of service. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300706/</a></p>
