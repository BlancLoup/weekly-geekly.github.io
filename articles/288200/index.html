  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About blog navigation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To begin with, I will try to describe my vision of what Blogs in Runet are.  So, blogs are often personal diaries of users, where various life stories are published.  But, in them, at times, a large proportion is occupied by content that can be considered news, and sometimes even scientific (various articles, reviews, etc.). <br><br>  So, over time, a lot of blogs turned into a kind of media.  Moreover, more truthful, with less time to respond to situations and events in the world.  For example, the problems that have arisen with ICQ were very quickly voiced on Habr√© and immediately began to receive solutions to this problem.  It was Habr who became a kind of main source of knowledge that kept us all informed all the time. <br><br>  And now you can see the trend that all the important personalities, companies in the world open their diaries, blogs that cover events around themselves and their activities. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As an example, one can cite the blogs of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev on the site <a href="http://blog.kremlin.ru/">kremlin.ru</a> or in the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/blog_medvedev/">LiveJournal</a> , the President of the United States Barack Obama on the bird.com resource <a href="http://twitter.com/barackobama">twitter.com</a> , corporate blogs of major Internet projects such as <a href="http://googlerussiablog.blogspot.com/">Google</a> , <a href="http://clubs.ya.ru/company/">Yandex</a> , which publish all the latest news about the development of services, which then very quickly diverge in the media (they just copy-paste and start chewing on interesting facts in their own way, for their audience).  Of course, a separate mention and respect deserves our well-loved Habr, whose blogging environment very quickly reacts to various innovations, problems on the Internet, in the programming environment and in the electronic world.  And in general, a lot of interesting and useful things can be found on Habr√© ...

      But the main means of searching for information in blogs do not provide an opportunity to separate news, popular science content from personal records or just spam.  Of course, there are blogosphere directories (for example, by communities, topics, interests), there are blog ratings that form the major search engines.  But all this does not allow you to quickly find the information that interests you.  You can walk for long hours, wander around blogs and surf the web, but the effectiveness of this event tends to zero.  Also, the existing mechanisms for collecting blogs of blog entries, such as frending, general flows, rubricated streams, tag searches and just search by request, do not allow searching for the most interesting content. <br><br>  For example, if you take the main leaders of the blogosphere Runet, such as <a href="http://livejournal.com/">LiveJournal.com</a> , <a href="http://liveinternet.ru/">Liveinternet.ru</a> , <a href="http://blogs.mail.ru/">blogs.mail.ru</a> - then try to find interesting records in them.  You go in, and you get the feeling that you‚Äôve got into the largest library of uncategorized aimless junk. <br><br>  But in blogs there is so much useful information on which you can learn, develop yourself, find answers to questions you have been asking yourself for a long time ... <br><br>  Of course, I‚Äôm not sure that the majority is wondering if this situation can be improved (many still need to spend some time aimlessly at work, although it would be better to work on it :)), but still, let's see what mechanisms exist and what can you pin hopes on? <br><br><h1>  Ratings </h1>  Ratings are based on the main individual or combined criteria for assessing the quality of records.  Such as: <br><ul><li>  number of views viewed </li><li>  number of comments </li><li>  author rating </li><li>  number of reprints </li><li>  possible and others. </li></ul>  But, they have a main problem - it‚Äôs very difficult to enter a newbie (whether it‚Äôs an individual or a separate new blogosphere).  After all, in order to get into the rating it is necessary to attract a fairly large audience, which for various reasons may not come to the resource.  But in such unpopular blogs sometimes interesting facts, news from the scientific or near-scientific world, interesting reviews that can compete with reviews of professional sources are revealed. <br><br>  Thus, newcomers or unpopular resources will not be able to get into the rating, and for society they will be lost.  There are many such examples, even on Habr√© this often happens when interesting articles ‚Äúdie‚Äù in the sandbox. <br><br><h1>  Search engines </h1>  Of course, we all know and look for the information we need in search engines.  But we also often encounter the fact that it is on 10 or more pages of search results that you can find what you need, and not on the first.  And, after all, the blogosphere implies communication around the recording, problem solving, therefore popular resources that publish articles or reviews have no comments, among which there is useful information.  This mainly concerns, as it seems to me, news resources (there is a general trouble there). <br><br><h1>  Friends recommendations </h1>  This, of course, is one of the accepted and popular means for creating an information field around itself and its loved ones, acquaintances.  You can always think and calculate that it is the acquaintances or friends of interest around who create or find interesting content that may also interest itself.  But, after all, even friends often spam in their blogs, throw out incomprehensible nonsense, and all this nonsense flies into a common feed.  Which sometimes do not even want to look.  Therefore, in my opinion, this is certainly one of the most important ways to search for interesting things, but far from useful. <br><br><h1>  Automatic recommendations </h1>  Having a mechanism for forming an automatic group of recommenders and a list of recommendations based on user ratings, Imkhonet created the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Blogs + Web 3.0 service.  A bold title of course, but I will try to explain the essence.  Web 3.0 is a kind of mechanism where users produce content themselves and certify and evaluate it themselves.  And on the basis of content certification, everyone is given only that which is hypothetically interesting to him. <br><br>  So, what can blogs give, combined with the mechanism of evaluation and formation of personal recommendations, and what new set of features and useful functions for users can be: <br><ul><li>  quick, easy statement of your attitude to blog entries by evaluating them </li><li>  personal filtering of good, interesting content through personal recommendations </li><li>  the possibility of forming ratings of blog entries based on a direct relationship to them, a direct statement about their quality </li><li>  separation of news and other rubricated content from general records (diaries) of blogosphere users </li><li>  the possibility of forming a collection of interesting blog entries </li><li>  broadening of horizons by avoiding the usual mechanisms of forming tape records (usually friends tape tapes).  In this case, the number of users of high-quality content that is personally interesting to the user is not limited. </li><li>  departure from the dependence of the quality of content on the popularity of the author </li></ul>  Thus, Blogs + Web 3.0 - can be a system transition from ribbons created by franding to general, thematic, most complete and personal for everyone. <br><br>  Do you have any ideas and thoughts on this? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288200/</a></p>
