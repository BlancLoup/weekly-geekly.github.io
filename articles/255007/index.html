  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In the wake of WinHEC (Hardware Engineering Conference) 2015 - Windows 10, IoT, AllJoyn, clouds, and more</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br>  In March, the <b>WinHEC (Hardware Engineering Conference)</b> conference was held. It was born in 1992 and has not been held since 2008.  At the end of 2014, it was announced that in 2015 the conference will return in a new format and will consist of several events.  The first event took place in March in Shenzhen, and there they discovered a lot of information about <b>Windows 10</b> - organizational, technical, plus a lot of attention was paid to the <b>Internet of Things</b> - from boards (Raspberry PI, for example) to cooperation with alliances (AllSeen with AllJoyn).  WinHEC itself continues a glorious tradition - a lot of technical, often hardcore, content. <br><br>  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WinHEC/2015">All videos</a> have recently been uploaded, and we recommend for viewing to anyone who is interested in what is now and what will happen next (some in Chinese).  We did a little review and put it under the screen. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the first and most filled with big news was the report of Terry Myerson, the head of Windows, from which it was possible to find out that, for example ( <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/03/17/windows-10-launching-this-summer-in-190-countries-and-111-languages/">full announcement</a> ): <br>  - Windows 10 will be launched in the summer in 190 countries in 111 languages.  Specific dates were not called, but, given the summer in the United States from about June 20 to September 23, you can get a rough idea. <br>  ‚ÄúIn collaboration with vendors like Lenovo, many versions of Windows (7, 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1) will be upgraded to 10 for free. <br>  - In collaboration with vendors such as Xiaomi, Windows 10 will be tested and updated for phones. <br>  - Windows Hello was announced - system biometrics support. <br>  - In Windows 10 there will be a massive integration of technologies from the world of the Internet of Things, including AllJoyn, etc. <br><br>  In addition to the session of Terry Myerson, there were others at WinHEC, and from a not entirely "iron" one can mention the sessions of Don Box (Distinguished engineer, a very honorable position in Microsoft) about the Windows 10 Hardware Platform Overview and Steve Tesheira about Building IoT Devices.

      Don, in addition to the future, spoke about the past, how decisions were made to merge several branches of the Microsoft OS development (Xbox, Windows, Windows Phone, IoT, HoloLens and Surface Hub), and how the process of developing applications and drivers looks in general. for Windows 10. The report is rather very informative than deep-technical, which does not detract from its value for readers and viewers.  Don also announced support for Raspberry Pi 2, Qualcomm and Intel motherboards for Windows 10. We recommend looking <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WinHEC/2015/Developing-for-the-Windows-10-Device-Platform">here</a> . <br><br><img src="http://litehtmlconv.azurewebsites.net/api/pics/vgezl1wtlqlgxqeg8p11th2l"><br><br>  The report by Steve Tesheira, director of programs in the vertical of Internet Of Things, was dedicated to Windows 10 for IoT.  Steve is a well-known popularizer of the Internet of Things technology and has his <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Steve-Teixeira">own show on Channel 9</a> .  His report plunged listeners deep into the integration of Windows 10 and IoT.  In general, we can draw several conclusions: <br>  - There will be at least three versions of Windows 10. Adding to this edition for IoT, it will be possible to count about 6 editions (IoT Mobile, IoT Small Devices and IoT Industry Devices). <br><br><img src="http://litehtmlconv.azurewebsites.net/api/pics/b5yg1nsk-0lua-73ul_l6fb0"><br><br>  - Windows 10 is a great environment for developing inside the IoT concept. <br>  - Under Windows 10, you can write universal drivers.  Since universalization and unification within the IoT concept are important and decisive topics for some fundamental issues, the presence of generalized DDI for drivers and their isolation from other software issues is an extremely positive moment. <br>  - With Windows 10 on small form factors there should not be any problems with activation even in the absence of the Internet. <br>  - Depending on the edition of Windows for IoT, there will be different possibilities for blocking functionality.  Useful for small devices that are constantly having problems with security and access. <br>  - Windows for IoT has full support for proven security tools (TPM) plus new features (Measured Boot). <br>  - Completely unexpected news for many!  AllJoyn support in <b>all editions of</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>10.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eae/918/62f/eae91862ff483e90d364a5bf0c5c0b69.png"><br><br><ul><li>  Integration of AllJoyn with Windows SDK and Visual Studio! </li></ul><img src="http://litehtmlconv.azurewebsites.net/api/pics/1e8_y1i5kmuk0wkal6gnlrnan"><br><ul><li>  The most important component of Microsoft‚Äôs IoT strategy is the use of the Microsoft Azure cloud.  The cloud solves one of the fundamental problems of IoT ‚Äî the issue of scaling the server component ‚Äî by adding rapid deployment of pre-provisioned resources and setting up automatic scaling to respond to an abrupt change in the number of events or devices.  In addition, Microsoft Azure has a whole set of services, combining which, you can realize any complexity of the life cycle of communication of your devices. </li></ul><img src="http://litehtmlconv.azurewebsites.net/api/pics/20fftj7pruec1tjd05i3ew-98"><br><br>  An example of such an architecture with a server component in the form of a cloud is shown in the screenshot, which is not related to the presentation of Steve, but clearly demonstrates the capabilities of the cloud.  Devices send messages to the gateway (WebAPI or local), which redirects messages to a queue in the cloud (Event Hub).  Messages are picked up from the real-time queue by the Stream Analytics service, which executes a SQL query to collect and process these messages from the incoming stream and redirects the result to the outgoing stream, which may look like another queue, the repository or SQL Server.  By placing the data in the repository, they can be displayed in any convenient form for the client (or, if Stream Analytics displays the result in another queue, we can write a website and use SignalR to display incoming messages). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5d/adb/4c1/e5dadb4c16ce2b32982898e61fe12875.png"><br><br><h4>  Summarizing </h4><br><br>  We can definitely say that the return of WinHEC in the old format is a very positive trend.  At the conference in Shenzhen, there were a lot of announcements (including completely unexpected ones), even more deep technical information, which inspires confidence that it will only be more interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255007/</a></p>
