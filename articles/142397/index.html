  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Manage domain delegation or why goat bayan</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Lyrics </h4><br>  The registrars and hosting companies are different: reliable and not very, terrible in their curvature and vice versa - clearly working, with friendly and responsive technical support and with the complete absence of it.  At first glance, they are all terrible, because they are carefully trying to hide their "bright" side. <br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúEveryone went dirty.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>That is why they became similar,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And under the rain were different.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Most are honest, good. ‚Äù</i> <br>  ¬© SashBash </blockquote>  When studying proposals in this service sector, classification and subsequent rigorous selection, it is possible to find decent specimens.  Already knowing the pitfalls of each of them, treasure and recommend selected. <br>  But even they never cease to amaze. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The essence </h4><br>  One of these days, I asked one of the customers to ‚Äúconnect‚Äù to the domain hosting.  At first he tried to do it himself, but he didn‚Äôt figure out what to press and in what sequence, so he sent access to the office. <br>  When I saw the registrar's URL in the letter, I involuntarily shuddered, remembering wandering around the office of this provider, as recently as a few weeks ago, in search of the control I needed. <br>  I need to make a reservation here that not only I sit in the console and have <s>not seen the light of white,</s> I have some experience in managing domain settings through self-written (and not so) control panels.  At least, in personal offices of Garant-Park, Ru-Center, Name.com and many other providers of similar services, I have never had any problems finding the right button. <br><br><h4>  Song </h4><br>  First, out of habit, I go to the page of the excellent <a href="http://whoisdigger.com/">WHOIS.digger</a> service and I see that the domain has not yet been delegated. <br><br>  <i>This is normal</i> (as the hero Mashkov said in a <s>famous</s> film).

      I am going to the ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù, having logged in, I quickly find the required ‚ÄúDelegation Parameters‚Äù and boldly press ‚ÄúSave‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/578/fe0/d48/578fe0d4823a0c6c8a8161e347548392.png"><br><br>  In response, the following message is displayed in the browser: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/46d/9e8/c46/46d9e8c460f5583b16c2fe5746b3b27c.png"><br><br>  Then a doubt creeps in and, just in case, I check for the presence of an SOA record: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/063/c2c/35d/063c2c35d5e8847b0035c1ac74ce148c.png"><br><br>  Restarting the entire personal account in search of a button to create a zone (initially you always think that you are a fool), I understand that there is simply no such functionality. <br><blockquote>  <i>"The fat is in the fire.</i>  <i>Today we laugh?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But if there is a bell under the arc,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So that means everything.</i>  <i>Charge - go! "</i> <br>  ¬© SashBash </blockquote>  ‚ÄúMaybe something broke at them,‚Äù I suggested, dialing the support phone number.  Support after hearing doubts said that "... yes, the zone is not created." <br>  ‚ÄúAnd how can it be created using the panel?‚Äù I asked intrigued. <br>  ‚ÄúI already created it for you, you can manage the domain in four hours,‚Äù the support responded cheerfully. <br>  - ‚ÄúWell, and yet?  How to do it yourself, not pulling you once again.  To know for the future ... ", - I did not let up. <br>  ‚ÄúIndependently, by no means,‚Äù the voice on the other end of the line honestly admitted. <br><br>  No, I understand everything.  But since there is a cabinet and there is a functional in it - it <b>should work as expected</b> .  And so, it is absolutely useless for some time. <br>  And it's good that I still know the words DNS and SOA, but the owner of the domain, who is given the key to his door, may well not know the word "delegation." <br><br>  <i>This is normal</i> (as the hero Mashkov said in a <s>famous</s> film). <br><br>  But just what would you do in this case, the domain owner, an ordinary user?  He will not even be able to explain something from his hand what exactly he cannot do ... <br><br><h4>  Nostalgic </h4><br>  Why am I doing all this?  And besides, there was a time when the technical department of the "Caravan" was headed by Sergey Khripko.  The server (and everything connected with it) was flexibly configured on the first client request, despite the fact that it was within the framework of virtual hosting only. <br>  And if it could not be configured (changed) for technological reasons, a detailed answer was always sent to why this could not be done. <br><br>  The office was called billing and it worked as expected to the functionality declared in it exactly until it was reworked by the <i>samynamentekto</i> . <br><br>  This list could go on for a long time, but ... <br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúBut every day times change.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Domes have lost gold.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Ringers around the world are loitering.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The bells are knocked down and split. ‚Äù</i> <br>  ¬© SashBash </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142397/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142397/</a></p>
