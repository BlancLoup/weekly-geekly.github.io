  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Robot vacuum cleaner: 10 main selection criteria</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd0/985/e47/cd0985e470b82cd41a6f9f8eb5f246a6.jpg">  A few decades ago, the emergence of washing vacuum cleaners on the home appliances market was considered a real breakthrough.  They greatly facilitated cleaning, thus gaining unprecedented popularity.  The situation changed when they were replaced by robot vacuum cleaners.  This type of intelligent home appliances was originally considered an expensive toy, from which there is not too much benefit.  The realization that the robot vacuum cleaner is a functional thing that turns the cleaning process into a fairy tale came after the range of this equipment expanded significantly, and models of different manufacturers, price categories and functionality appeared on the home appliances market. <br><br>  Today, to choose a robot vacuum among a large number of options is very difficult.  Here are the main criteria to consider when buying intelligent home equipment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Build quality </h2><br>  On how this or that model of the robot vacuum cleaner is assembled, convenience of its operation and service life largely depends.  Experts in the field of assembly and quality control argue that among modern models of excellent quality technique differs Neato Botvac D-Series D75.  In the manufacture of this model uses high-quality materials.  We are talking not only about the body and the electric drive, but also about the side brushes.  The quality of the latter largely depends on how long the robot will last and whether it will be a great helper in cleaning or will be gathering dust. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fab/320/996/fab3209961f49ef4e9763fdd7656b642.jpg" alt="image">

      <br>
      This model is equipped with a casing that reliably protects the equipment from winding wires and other similar items.  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/cv">Also</a> , the side brushes of the <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/cv">NeatoBotvac D-Series D75</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/389929/">*</a> ) are bent in the direction of rotation and fixed to a rubber base, which acts as a pneumatic cushion. <br><br><h2>  The number of side brushes </h2><br>  It is desirable that the side brushes of the robot vacuum cleaner was two.  Indeed, in this case, it will be guaranteed to clean the corners and baseboards along the walls.  As a rule, models with the cost of twenty thousand rubles are delivered for sale in this configuration.  But there are budget options with two side brushes.  These are <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/cx">Pakwang SQ-A380</a> robotic vacuum cleaners ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/389929/">*</a> ).  They are equipped with two removable side brushes that can effectively clean various types of floor coverings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/867/4d9/838/8674d9838f1fb14fbc78d7913a2aab05.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Noise level </h2><br>  The robot spends a lot of time cleaning.  With a conventional vacuum cleaner, you would deal with this problem a little faster.  That is why you should choose intelligent technology with a low noise level so that a working robot does not distract you from work or interfere with rest.  The recommended noise level should not exceed sixty decibels. <br><br>  Among the budget intellectual vacuum cleaners, the characteristic is the model of the brand <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/cy">Puppyoo V-M900R</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/389929/">*</a> ).  This is a functional robot with remote control, infrared sensors and a powerful lithium battery. <br>  The fact that all expensive robots have a low noise level, and there is no need to say. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d5/c1c/fc5/3d5c1cfc5df960aa9afb162a43d00a84.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  The presence of sensors drop, touch, collision </h2><br>  Most modern robotic vacuum cleaners are equipped with sensors that allow you to adjust the routes of equipment, and increase maneuverability.  They are of three types and have a different purpose.  All modern models have touch sensors.  They signal that there is a barrier in the immediate vicinity, after which the robot changes the route.  Their main task is to prevent a vacuum cleaner from colliding with a large object, which can not only slow down cleaning, but also cause damage to equipment. <br><br>  The collision sensors in most models are located under the bumper of rubber.  They signal that any object is nearby, after which the vacuum cleaner starts moving in the opposite direction.  Such electronics are equipped with expensive and cheap models. <br><br>  Drop sensors are located at the bottom of the robot.  Their task is to signal a change in floor height.  Thanks to them, the vacuum cleaner successfully copes with any obstacles, and can even be used for cleaning stairs with a large number of steps.  These sensors are equipped with more expensive models of intellectual technology, such as <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/d6">Neato XV-11</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/389929/">*</a> ).  This is a stylish vacuum cleaner with a touch panel, remote control and the ability to create motion algorithms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79e/62d/115/79e62d11515b417dfc918667a8d63d41.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Presence of the mode of wet cleaning </h2><br>  In terms of functionality, naturally expensive models benefit.  Vacuum cleaners that can perform wet cleaning are in high demand.  At the same time, low-end models simply wipe the floor without removing serious dirt, while the <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/d5">iClebo Art√© device</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/389929/">*</a> ), equipped with a quality cloth, quickly and <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/d5">efficiently</a> handles various degrees of pollution on all types of surfaces.  This vacuum cleaner has other advantages, among which one should highlight the stylish design, durable housing, touch screen and a powerful battery, the charge of which is enough for cleaning a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe house. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/21d/d25/a7f/21dd25a7fa0960200e868ed62f9717fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Remote control </h2><br>  The presence of a remote control greatly facilitates the cleaning process.  Even if the robot gets tangled in the wires or cannot drive around any obstacle, you will have the opportunity to change its route with the help of the console.  It is noteworthy that today the remote control is mainly equipped with premium devices, such as <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/cz">Seebest D730</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/389929/">*</a> ).  This is a model with an ultrathin filter, several modes of cleaning surfaces and a lithium battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e29/9e6/525/e299e6525c33e5d88618c0f549e340cc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Charging method </h2><br>  Some of the robotic vacuum cleaners have a convenient base for recharging, which allows it to independently return and restore energy.  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/d7">Chuw iilife v7 Bluetooth mini</a> has a good base ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/389929/">*</a> ) - this is a robot with remote control and automatic control of the route. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ee/ae5/6e8/3eeae56e8f25580af58a26d701943d24.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inexpensive models can be charged for several hours, while their power is not enough to clean a few rooms.  Because of this, the cleaning is stretched for the whole day. <br><br><h2>  Ultrasound Echolocation </h2><br>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/d1">Seebest C561</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/389929/">*</a> ) - premium- <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/d1">class</a> robot vacuum cleaner, equipped with ultrasonic sensors operating on the principle of echolocation.  Due to this, intelligent equipment has the ability to estimate the distance of the obstacle and adjust its own speed.  Accordingly, in empty premises, such vacuum cleaners move quickly, and where there is a lot of furniture and other items - slowly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6bc/50a/8aa/6bc50a8aa21d4171a53128ab7928ebb0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Determination of the level of contamination </h2><br>  The function of determining the level of pollution is represented by a special sensor.  They are equipped with expensive models, costing from twenty thousand rubles.  Thanks to this sensor, the vacuum cleaner can determine the level of contamination of the room and change the speed of movement, as well as choose the mode of cleaning.  This feature has a model <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/d2">Chuwi V3</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/389929/">*</a> ) with multiple cleaning modes, a lithium battery and a durable case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58a/4d6/70d/58a4d670d4ed4dcaa9c9df3808405015.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Cost of </h2><br>  Choosing a price category for the purchase of a robot vacuum cleaner, it should be borne in mind that not only premium equipment has a lot of functions and modes.  But if you decide to purchase an inexpensive model, it is better to give preference to the product with the best reviews and less functionality.  Let the smart vacuum cleaner be designed only for dry cleaning, but it will produce it qualitatively, such as, for example, <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/d3">Pakwang SQ-A380</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/389929/">*</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe7/31e/ccc/fe731ecccb195fec44d1a8605a0f3404.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Design </h2><br>  Many people today pay attention to the appearance of home appliances.  In this case, vacuum cleaning robots are no exception.  Naturally, all models of the premium segment have a stylish progressive design.  Among the low-cost such characteristics boasts <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/d4">Puppyoo V-M611</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/389929/">*</a> ).  Their design can be called simple and presentable at the same time.  The matt case of vacuum cleaners is designed in high-tech style. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/514/f2b/e49/514f2be49268f5ec9da3cd6d99f75def.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After analyzing the main selection criteria, you will be able to understand what kind of robot vacuum cleaner you need.  Note that models up to fifteen - twenty thousand rubles, equipped with a large number of functions, are unlikely to last for a long time.  Unfortunately, there is no golden mean for robotics.  Therefore, the choice will have to be made between budget models with a limited number of functions and premium vacuum cleaners. <br><br>  If you decide to purchase an inexpensive robot vacuum cleaner, pay attention to the CHUWI ILIFE V7.  This is a quiet model, with a fairly capacious battery and costing <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/d7">$ 134</a> *.  It will produce high quality dry cleaning in your home and delight you with its stylish design.  Well, for those who are willing to spend $ 399 on purchasing intellectual equipment, I would recommend paying attention to the premium model <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/cz">Seebest D 730</a> *.  This robot vacuum cleaner with a mass of useful functions will become your faithful assistant for many years. <br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
