  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wiki in the service of democracy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the few years that have passed since the birth of the Internet, the global network has already managed to show its mighty power.  Theoretically, every inhabitant of the planet now has access to huge arrays of the most diverse information, from Hollywood gossip to the latest scientific papers in breakthrough branches of knowledge. <br><br>  But the surface gradually emerges a lot of questions that until recently did not pay attention.  Will self-organizing communities be able to effectively supply themselves with all the necessary information?  How objective will it be, free from the influence of individual charismatic leaders of the ‚Äúcrowd‚Äù and the various hidden forces that are talked about so much in conspiracy theories?  Is there any strength at all if there is no one who can say what to do with it? <br><br>  From the very beginning, the lyric information workers have been waiting for the moment when this power can be turned, if not on the salvation of the world, then at least on its significant improvement.  High hopes for a society of total awareness, from which no villain can hide, everyone now resolutely connects only with the Internet, no longer relying on the professional press of the old school.

      And the most agile representatives of the ‚Äúfifth column‚Äù are already trying with all their might to pass for their own in this big movement in the direction in which, according to modern ideas, there is a bright future.  We see this in the example of even such masters as the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, who in many ways determined the face of objective and impartial journalism in their time.  The trend is so strong that billions of publishing capitals are put on the map without question, although no one has yet said with complete certainty that investing in the socialization of the media is the right way. <br><br>  Against this background, no one is particularly surprised by the emergence of such a project as <a href="http://www.wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks.org</a> .  His ideological inspirer, well-known blogger John Young, having assembled a reliable team of freedom fighters, swung, no less, no less than the state secrets of half the countries of the world. <br><br>  On the project site is planned to collect secret documents.  Like <a href="">this one</a> , for example, in which the Somali government gives several orders that greatly complicate the situation in the region.  At the moment, according to the creators of Wikileaks, at their disposal there are already 1,200,000 such documents handed over to them by various opposition and dissident organizations. <br><br>  Young singled out a clear circle of countries whose governments considered it necessary to keep under strict control in the interests of their own people.  This position is very much in the spirit of modern US foreign policy and therefore has been repeatedly discussed long before the appearance of Wikileaks.  There are also no surprises in this circle: the states of the former Soviet bloc, the Middle and Far East and Africa are planned to be put under observation. <br><br>  In general, the idea is crystal clear and not yet burdened with technical details.  There is probably no lack of secret information, so the project database will be provided with content, and the site's engine is not much different from other Wiki engines. <br><br>  It‚Äôs quite another matter where this information will actually come from.  No wonder that rumors about the $ 5 million fee that Young received from the CIA began to persist.  Or in vain ... In any case, to be continued. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5041/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5041/</a></p>
