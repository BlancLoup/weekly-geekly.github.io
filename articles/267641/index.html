  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the guarantee that the warranty will help out</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Modern organizations rely on server equipment for their informational structure.  Uninterrupted work of the company depends on its reliability.  The realities are such that even the most reliable technology from time to time suffers from interruptions in operation: fans, hard drives, power supplies, etc.  often turn out to be weak links of the system.  Since idle time is no longer calculated in hours and minutes, and often in tens and hundreds of thousands of lost rubles, it is time to think about taking warranty measures.  And the measures can be very diverse.  Since our company is more focused on Hewlett-Packard equipment, we decided to analyze the options and prices for them in the HP Care Pack warranty package. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f30/d0f/00c/f30d0f00c04b430eb0a275a77789225b.jpg"><br><br>  The fact is that when buying equipment it is difficult to get a comprehensive consultation on this product, and most importantly - to find out how much it all costs.  In the end, there are a lot of options and you need to analyze all their components, starting from the specifics of your organization and, of course, prices. <br><br>  The price for various HP Care Pack extensions is set depending on the equipment you purchase and its cost.  And even as a percentage, information on the value of types of guarantees is not given.  Only one way out: to be guided by practice.

      We decided to analyze the cost of purchasing an HP server solution combined with a paid warranty package HP Care Pack.  Requests for invoicing were sent to several large companies selling Hewlett-Packard products.  On the bill, we decided to turn on the server with a sufficient number of hard drives.  HP ProLiant DL360 G9 servers of relatively modest configuration were ordered: 2x1.6 GHz E-2603 6-Core processors, 64 GB RAM, 8 300GB 2.5 '' SAS 10k disks, 2 500W power supplies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/490/f2a/c35/490f2ac3563a41cdb05c7239d5a605a0.jpg"><br><br>  The minimum cost of all this splendor came out in rounds of 725,000 rubles, and this is only the cost of equipment.  The cost of warranty services will be discussed below.  We can say in advance that the warranty conditions of the companies to which we applied are about the same, depending on the mark-up.  However, for data purity, we will use information provided by a Hewlett-Packard representative. <br><br>  First of all, it‚Äôs worth finding out what this Care Pack is and what levels of service it provides within HP.  To do this, I would like as an example to cite a page from the HP Care Pack Question and Answer brochure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/026/646/944/02664694497d46c9aa58e12ec13c9943.jpg"><br><br>  First, we analyze the general provisions. <br><br>  You can choose a warranty with self-delivery of equipment to the service center or repair with departure to the customer.  In fact, all firms selling HP products with whom we communicated offer only a type of guarantee with a trip to the place of failure.  Moreover, the standard warranty, which is included in the price of the equipment, is issued for 3 years with a specialist visiting you the next working day after applying, which in theory is an undeniable advantage.  But!  I would like to immediately make a couple of reservations about this: <br><br>  - any field services with the specified conditions are distributed within a radius of 80 km from the nearest service center (if you are further away, conditions are negotiated separately); <br>  - in fact, based solely on our experience, the next weekday help does not come, and numerous clarifications begin, forcing the system administrator to almost understand the problem himself.  And now, after about a week, the equipment was still taken away for repair (perhaps such an incident occurred only with us, but special cases are usually not isolated).  Perhaps it is precisely to fulfill the conditions that there is an identical, but already paid rate (more on that below).  As a result, this type of guarantee for many may be insufficient. <br><br>  Another item that is provided to each of the extensions is the removal or non-removal of defective media.  In other words, if you have confidential information on a broken HDD that you don‚Äôt want to trust anyone even in a damaged form, then with a small surcharge to the guarantee rate, after replacing them with serviceable ones, they are not withdrawn, but remain with you.  And so you can do with them as your heart desires.  Further we will assume that defective media are withdrawn in order not to inflate the issue price. <br><br>  Now the most popular HP Care Pack extensions will be considered point by point. <br><br>  <b>1. Service with guaranteed response time to the fault.</b> <br><br>  In this expansion, time intervals of service support are offered: 9x5 (9: 00-18: 00 on weekdays), 13x5 (9: 00-22: 00 on weekdays), 24x7 (day and night).  Additionally, a parameter such as ‚Äúreaction time‚Äù is introduced in two versions: NBD (next working day) and 4 hours.  NBD is attached to the 9x5 tariff, and 4-hour response for 13x5 and 24x7 tariffs.  For example, choose the tariff 13x5x4.  You came to work and found that the server is out of order.  Call HP support and after 4 hours after the call an expert is with you. <br>  Now to practice. <br><br>  Prices for our server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30e/648/844/30e648844a1c48faaeea7b73e2dba66d.jpg"><br><br>  It can be concluded that prices in this case are very loyal.  However, it is worth considering that the lower the price of equipment, the greater the percentage will cost this or that warranty option.  As you can see, the daily equipment will cost much cheaper than the 4-hour response to a breakdown.  But!  Overpayment for urgency may well be impaired depending on the type of failure.  It is said that after 4 hours the master will start repair, but it is not known when the damage will be fixed.  However, sharper lines offer the following Care Pack extension. <br><br>  <b>2. Service with guaranteed recovery time.</b> <br><br>  An extension that provides guarantees for completing the repair of equipment at a fixed time: 9x5 with guaranteed troubleshooting NBD and 24x7 with a guarantee of troubleshooting in 6 hours.  However, the 9x5 format (NBD) is available to those who are within 160 km from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Samara, Kazan, Khabarovsk and Vladivostok;  24x7 (6 hours) not more than 80 km from the same cities.  For other localities, the guaranteed time for repairing a fault is calculated in a maximum of 5 working days.  So if you are no more than 80 km from the above mentioned cities and you are the happy owner of the 24x7 tariff (6 hours), then within 6 hours after applying, your equipment will be in service. <br><br>  Prices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c3/8ff/970/9c38ff9700d04593bcfeb2970b9219e2.jpg"><br><br>  If your equipment is a little further from the cities listed above, this guarantee has dubious advantages.  Although, the most modest guarantee of the 9x5 format (NBD) will provide you with the commissioning of equipment within 5 days, which is not guaranteed by the previous expansion. <br><br>  <b>3. HP Proactive Care comprehensive service.</b> <br><br>  This extension has already a qualitatively higher level.  Well, imagine how everything happens in reality.  Again.  Employees went to work, and remote access does not work for them.  They contact the system administrator.  He in turn begins to look for a problem.  And only by finding the cause of the failure or not finding it at all, calls the support service.  And only from this moment time has gone. <br><br>  All these delays result in unnecessary idle hours, and the hours translate into precious piastres.  What is offered in Proactive Care?  This extension includes the previous two with one significant difference.  Here the problem is tracked automatically via iLO.  The time of access to the center of HP coincides with the time of failure.  All tariffs have a 24x7 support format and are distinguished by reaction time to a malfunction or time guarantee of elimination of a malfunction. <br><br>  But how much is all this worth? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/232/b50/43a/232b5043a86e436aba4b5ef3d9e95900.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see such support flies a pretty penny.  Needless to say, for some companies, delays are very much fraught, but than to buy a 5-year warranty, is it not easier and cheaper to buy a full-scale spare parts kit?  This information is entirely to customers' thinking. <br><br>  <b>4. HP Support Plus comprehensive service.</b> <br><br>  This extension is similar to service with guaranteed response time to a fault, including a software warranty.  It supports 13x5 and 24x7 formats with the start of equipment repair after 4 hours and software support after 2 hours.  Basically, such a guarantee is recommended by firms when purchasing storage.  In percentage terms, prices do not differ much with similar conditions without software support.  But given the extensive range of configurations of disk shelves, the percentage may vary. <br><br>  HP recommends purchasing these warranty support options with hardware.  One thing is clear: in the presence of a single server company it makes sense to insure yourself against a malfunction.  In practice, serious breakdowns are rare.  HDDs, power units mostly fly, extremely rarely - memory stripes, so repair in most cases will be limited to replacing the failed part.  Therefore, it may well be limited to the first version of the 3-year warranty support in the 13x5x4 format.  In this case, the total cost will be 761.250 rubles. <br><br>  However, for small business organizations there is a great option for less money to get better guarantees of uninterrupted equipment operation.  Output: server hardware refurbished.  After all, by purchasing 2 HP Proliant DL360 G7 servers in a similar configuration, you already have the opportunity to create a fault-tolerant cluster in which the virtualization program will rely on a disk system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89d/959/b9d/89d959b9d48e49ea9301ed8203d390a5.jpg"><br><br>  Consider the following kit: <br>  1. 2 <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servery_hp_proliant_dl360_1u/hp_proliant_dl360g7_2x2_93_ggts_xeon_six_core_kh5670_64gb_8x8_pc3_10600r_no_hdd_sas_sa_p410_2_pws/">HP Proliant DL360 G7 2x2.93 GHz Xeon Six-Core x5670 / 64Gb (8x8) servers PC3-10600R / no HDD SAS 2.5 "Hot Swap / 2xPower 2x1200W</a> - 139.800 rubles x 2 = 279.600 rubles; <br><br>  2. 2 <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servernye_komplektuyushchie_optsii/komplekt_dlya_podklyucheniya_4_kh_hdd_dlya_servera_hp_dl360_g6_g7_sff_sas_hotswap_backplane_kit/">sets for connecting 4 HDDs</a> - 11.900 rubles.   2 = 23.800 rubles; <br><br>  3. 16 <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servernye_komplektuyushchie_zhyestkie_diski_hp_diski_sas_sata/2_5_hp_300gb_sas_10k_6g_sff_hdd_507127_b21_proizvodstvo_nr/">new 2.5 '' HDD SAS 300 GB 10k</a> - 13.950 rubles.   16 = 223.200 rubles. <br><br>  Total: 526.600 rubles. <br><br>  Moreover, in the event of a single server failing, the workflow does not stop, but also, focusing on the price of the new server we reviewed, you can purchase a described spare parts cluster <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servernye_komplektuyushchie_pamyat_ddr3_pc3_10600/hp_8gb_2rx4_pc3_10600r_ddr3_1333_ecc_cl9_p_n_500662_b21_proizvodstvo_hp/">consisting of HDD</a> , <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servernye_komplektuyushchie_zhyestkie_diski_hp_diski_sas_sata/2_5_hp_300gb_sas_10k_6g_sff_hdd_507127_b21_proizvodstvo_nr/">8 GB memory strip</a> and <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servernye_komplektuyushchie_bloki_pitaniya_hp/blok_pitaniya_1200w_hstns_pl11_dlya_hp_dl360g6_380g6_360g7_370g6_580g7_500172_b21_438203_001_/">1200W power supply</a> .  Such a ZIP will cost 29.250 rubles. <br><br>  In total, such a decision will cost 555,850 rubles.  As a result, a similar (for tasks) server solution is found, with a guarantee of fault tolerance and spare parts for less money. <br><br>  But, as stated more than once, the choice of the server solution and guarantees for it remains with the buyer, and we are ready to help with this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267641/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267641/</a></p>
