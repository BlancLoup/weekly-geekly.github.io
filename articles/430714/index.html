    <h2>  Reasons for the acquisition </h2><br>  In 2016, Heptio was founded by former Google employees Joe Beda and Craig McLuckie who, together with Brendan Burns, had previously developed Kubernetes.  Heptio was created to help other companies use Kubernetes for organizing business processes.  In particular, the startup offers open tools that simplify the deployment of container clusters. <br><br>  Heptio solutions interested VMware, so they made a deal in early November.  The tools that the startup has developed will be introduced into the VMware service for working with Kubernetes - Pivotal Container Service (PKS).  It allows administrators to manage application containers in public clouds and on-premise. <br><br>  The integration of the tools of the two companies in the future will speed up the process of implementing Kubernetes in organizations whose infrastructure is built on VMware solutions, and will attract new customers for the IT giant. <br><br>  According to the vice-president of VMware, both organizations want to develop Kubernetes as an open framework for creating hybrid cloud environments.  Heptio representatives also support him.  According to Craig Maklaki, a startup could well exist as an independent company, because it attracted large investments - this is about <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2018/11/06/vmware-acquire-heptio-accel-backed-startup-led-kubernetes-co-creators/">$ 33 million</a> .  But Craig is convinced that by working with VMware, they will be able to achieve great success in the development of Kubernetes. <br><br><h2>  How it will affect the industry </h2><br>  Experts <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-vmwares-heptio-purchase-finally-shows-its-getting-smart-about-open-source/">point</a> out that buying Heptio will make VMware one of the key players in the open source market and will have a major impact on Kubernetes. <br><br>  <b>Popularity will grow.</b>  According <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2018/11/07/vmware-heptio/">to</a> analysts of the cloud technology market, the purchase of Heptio can make Kubernetes a peculiar standard for the sweep of hybrid environments.  They connect this possibility with the fact that many other VMware technologies, for example, vSphere, have long become the <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/vmware-snaps-up-heptio-to-boost-its-kubernetes-cred/2018/11/">standard</a> for companies. <br><br>  Integrating Kubernetes with VMware tools will simplify the implementation of the framework in companies that have not worked with it before.  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D18391285">It is believed</a> that Kubernetes will begin to implement more organizations outside the IT sphere. <br><br>  Experts are concerned only with the fact that organizations will begin to implement Kubernetes even in cases where it is simply not needed.  The technology <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-know-if-kubernetes-is-right-for-your-saas-315dfffe0a25">benefits</a> when a company needs the ability to quickly expand its infrastructure or transfer applications between the cloud and its own data center.  If the company does not have such needs - the introduction of Kubernetes <a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/you-might-not-need-k8s/">will result in a waste of time and money</a> . <br><br>  <b>Development will go faster.</b>  Significant contribution to the development of an open product is always made by those companies that actively use it.  One of the most famous examples is the Linux kernel.  Only in 2017, 3% of changes to the code <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/2017-linux-kernel-report-landing-page/">were made by</a> developers from Google and Samsung.  For 13% of the changes "responsible" in Intel. <br><br>  For this reason, it is believed that such a large player, like VMware, will be able to bring new functionality to the Kubernetes ecosystem. <br><br>  Nevertheless, not everyone in the open source community responded positively to the deal.  Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/9unw2m/vmware_acquires_heptio_the_startup_founded_by_2/e95odzw/">fear</a> that due to the takeover of VMware, Heptio will no longer support its own tools for working with Kubernetes.  However, Heptio employees noted that VMware will continue to work on existing startup products. <br><br><h2>  Who else is developing Kubernetes </h2><br>  At the end of October, another major purchase occurred that would affect the Kubernetes ecosystem.  IBM <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/28/ibm-to-buy-red-hat-for-34b-in-cash-and-debt-taking-a-bigger-leap-into-hybrid-cloud/">acquired</a> Red Hat, and this deal was one of the largest in history ‚Äî its value was $ 34 billion. <br><br>  The main acquisition for IBM <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/29/wall-street-says-ibms-red-hat-acquisition-could-be-game-changing.html">was</a> the Kubernetes Red Hat OpenShift cluster management platform.  According <a href="https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/news/252451649/IBM-Red-Hat-acquisition-roils-open-source-container-management">to company representatives</a> , IBM and Red Hat are planning to jointly develop Kubernetes as a tool for creating hybrid cloud solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i1/hb/xu/i1hbxuaxrl7aqqka-d--jcc5iso.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://pxhere.com/ru/photo/878827">PxHere</a> PD</i></font> <br><br>  At the same time, Red Hat <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-acquire-red-hat-completely-changing-cloud-landscape-and-becoming-worlds-1-hybrid-cloud-provider">will remain an</a> independent unit with its leaders and development plans.  Therefore, IBM will not ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù Red Hat products, but will give the company resources for their further development, which will make Kubernetes more popular in the corporate infrastructure market. <br><br>  NetApp has become another company that joins the Kubernetes ecosystem.  In September, NetApp acquired the startup StackPointCloud, which created the kubernetes-as-a-service platform.  As a result, the market leader in disk storage systems introduced the <a href="https://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2018/10/29/5-hottest-technologies-at-netapp-insight-2018.aspx">new</a> NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS), which allows customers to manage Kubernetes clusters in public clouds or in their own data center. <br><br><h2>  Perspectives </h2><br>  The absorption of startups by large companies shows that corporations are striving to create services that simplify the implementation of Kubernetes.  The technology in the "pure form" has a significant drawback that prevents its spread - the <a href="https://konghq.com/blog/kubernetes-where-are-we-going/">complexity of</a> implementation.  The creators of the framework agree with this - Joe Bede himself <a href="https://twitter.com/jbeda/status/993978918196531200">wrote</a> that learning to work with Kubernetes is quite difficult. <br><br>  If IBM and VMware manage to create improved ‚Äúexperience of interaction‚Äù with cluster management platforms, the technology will become more and more popular, especially in <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252452580/Why-Kubernetes-is-driving-a-groundswell-in-containerisation">hybrid</a> cloud systems. <br><br>  This opinion is shared by other large companies - Google, Cisco and HPE <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-ibm-bought-red-hat-its-all-open-source-cloud-all-the-time/">are working</a> on their own hybrid infrastructure management tools using Kubernetes.  Probably in the near future we will see more new solutions aimed at developing a tool for managing containers. <br><br><hr><br>  PS Fresh materials from the First Corporate IaaS blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/kak-iaas-pomogaet-razvivat-biznes-tri-zadachi-kotorye-reshit-oblako/">How IaaS helps grow your business: three tasks that the cloud will solve</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/bezopasnost/effekt-gdpr-kak-novyj-reglament-povliyal-na-it-ekosistemu/">GDPR effect: how the new regulation has affected the IT ecosystem</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/besservernye-vychisleniya-v-oblake-trend-sovremennosti-ili-neobxodimost/">Serverless computing in the cloud: the trend of today or the need?</a> </li></ul><br>  PS IaaS in brief - our Telegram channel: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/174">NetApp from A to Z: a ‚Äã‚Äãreview of vendor technologies</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/175">NetApp from A to Z: continue to talk about the company's technology</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/173">Why a good IaaS-provider does not build its data center</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430714/</a></p>
