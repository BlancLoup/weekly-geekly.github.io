    <h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  Typography as an art created by type means is perhaps the most important subject for design students.  In the future professional activity they will have to solve many design problems, most of which will require in-depth knowledge of typography.  Rare projects will not be associated with fonts, moreover, some of them will only be associated with fonts.  The main means of communication will always be words. <br><br>  Students who are currently studying graphic design are the typographers of the future, and their success depends largely on how well they learn to work with the font. <br><br><h5>  Modern typography </h5><br>  Typography is a living art form, each generation of designers brings something new and progressive to it.  It is constantly evolving and changing, it requires both praise and criticism. <br><br>  This attitude did not happen today;  changes and typography experiments have generated a response since its inception.  Gutenberg's font was too cold; he lacked the warmth of handwritten fonts.  Headsets of the next centuries were scolded for excessive contrast, which strained the eyesight, which caused dizziness, and chopped fonts, as many believed, make reading difficult. <br><br>  The controversy continues.  A font no longer needs to remain ‚Äúinvisible,‚Äù a modest means of conveying the meaning of a text.  Today, the font can be expressive, funny, provocative, bold, and at its best, fine art. <br><br>  Some designers welcome change and freedom to experiment, others prefer the traditional approach.  Still others believe that the old and the new can coexist in order to enrich and diversify the world of means of typographic expressiveness as a result.  Anyway, in views on typography there is no single point of view.  Students should be open to everything new, to cover all the components of typographical tools and on the basis of them to form their own aesthetics. <br><br>  We hope that new generations of graphic designers will continue to expand the boundaries and violate the conventions of this type of art.  Some innovations will stand the test of time, others will simply mark the passing fashion trends.  And all this will be part of the rich history of typography. <br><br><h5>  Fifth edition </h5><br>  Although typography can be taught in various ways, the lesson plan is usually built around the concept of metal letters, since they are the source of our professional lexicon.  A new edition of the book Font and Design.  Modern typography contains extensive basic information, and also gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmodern technologies, which allows the reader to gain deep and thorough knowledge in the field of typography. <br><br>  In accordance with modern requirements, we have completely changed the format and content of the book, made it full-color and substantially supplemented with new information, retaining all the features that made it so useful to the designer. <br><br>  The first edition of the book Font and Design.  Modern typography ‚Äùwas published more than forty-five years ago.  It sold more than a quarter of a million copies, in design schools around the world began to use it as a textbook.  All this suggests that, despite significant changes in the field of design, the book Font and Design.  Modern typography ‚Äù, as before, teaches and inspires.  We believe that the fifth edition will be the most effective help for the new generation of graphic designers. <br><br><h5>  Examples of pages: </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36a/ea5/2a8/36aea52a8a0c43e887e89bb7e5189dc0.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/118/e70/1bb/118e701bb65d49dcb6e652157c5221ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcc/090/f58/bcc090f5874e40aeb36624cb4e572226.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e1/be3/e53/9e1be3e530e64c919c1337689ececab2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/736/dec/aa0/736decaa01cd4a0f88182116a99332c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a9/877/e9b/6a9877e9b2084a4bb520f64a5f089907.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On coated paper and in a live book of course it looks better :) <br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/new/product/shrift-i-dizayn-sovremennaya-tipografika-3">the publisher's website.</a> <br><br>  For Habrozhiteley 25% discount coupon - <b>Font and Design</b> <br><br>  Another book on the subject: <br>  <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/new/product/dizayn-sovremennyy-kreatiff">Design</a>  <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/new/product/dizayn-sovremennyy-kreatiff">Modern Creatiff</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282576/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282576/</a></p>
