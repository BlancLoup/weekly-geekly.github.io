  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Good news for the webmaster: Hamster Marketplace placed an offer on the RunCPA site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This week started the preliminary sale of tokens Hamster Marketplace - which means we completely stopped sleeping.  Crowdfunding nowadays is very troublesome.  However, any sales have never been a weekend occupation.  With this publication, we will begin to talk about our experiences in this difficult task - and we hope that it will be useful to others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p8/9j/bk/p89jbkpyzii-yfjy35s4fvrj-jy.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#808080"><em>Mithgol the Webmaster to attract attention</em></font> <br><br>  One of the ways to attract sales, which we have chosen, is CPA traffic from the RunCPA partner network.  CPA, ‚Äúpay per action‚Äù is an advertising model in which the customer (in this case, we) pays only for the desired result - usually sales that are directly accomplished.  At the same time, the CPA-model is very democratic - it allows you to earn not only the customer and the network, but also partners - webmasters, arbitrazhnik and in general any people who have access to an audience suitable for a particular advertisement.  For example, the <a href="https://runcpa.com/cabinet/offers/view/2168">Hamster Marketplace offer is</a> focused on crypto enthusiasts, cryptoinvestors, people who earn money on the Internet and users interested in the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project - a decentralized platform representing niche gadgets, DIY electronics and inventions from around the world without intermediaries.

    <h3>  Who is interested </h3><br>  Anyone can earn on CPA affiliates: from the owner of the portal with a million attendance to the admin of the public for a couple of hundred people.  The founder of RunCPA, Ivan Maslennikov, specifically for the Hamster Marketplace blog, explained that the key issue here is not at all the number: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  First of all, the quality of the audience matters, and only then other factors play a role.  Any webmaster connecting a CPA network must clearly understand whether his resource has relevant traffic.  You can not connect the campaign, focused on IT people, on resources, conditionally, for housewives and wait for the flow of leads from it.  Miracles do not happen. </blockquote><br>  In this sense, the RunCPA is ideal for the Hamster Marketplace offer: thanks to the payment of partner rewards in Bitcoins, the project has long gathered a huge number of crypto-enthusiasts around it. <br><br>  RunCPA began its work in 2015.  It was a significant year for the cryptosphere: the market was growing, projects were multiplying, the community acquired its own core and went beyond the small party of geeks who mined bitcoins or altcoins on farms from video cards.  For example, in 2015, the Ethereum cryptocurrency network was launched, which quickly became the No. 2 blockchain in the world.  With the subsequent arrival of smart contracts, the positions of the crypto community have only strengthened.  Due to the growth of the cryptocurrency population, the current mechanism of payments to webmasters was born: it was decided to make payments in Bitcoins, and not by Fiat.  Since then and until now, RunCPA continues to pay fees to webmasters exclusively in the most popular cryptocurrency.  Imagine how lucky those who did not withdraw their payments for a year or longer! <br><br>  The CPA-model is now confidently pushing out from the advertising market its earlier inhabitants - CPM (pay per impression) and CPC (pay per click).  Yes, some webmasters look after them with nostalgia - it was easier to earn them, but the market dictates its own rules, Ivan Maslennikov explains: <br><br><blockquote>  Now, no one in their right mind will pay for impressions or just clicks, in any case, allocate large budgets for this.  Even the requirement to register or download the application does not work.  Because all these budgets are very easily ‚Äúburned‚Äù by fraud traffic and other activities of dishonest advertisers: a conditional thousand of Pakistanis or Indians are taken, who in 25/8 mode are registered, clicked, download applications at the minimum rate.  The difference also goes into the pocket of the organizer of the event.  As a result: the budget was burned, real customers or users are not involved. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Yes, fraud's CPA models are an order of magnitude smaller, and the mechanism for paying for leads gives advertisers real returns.  Unfortunately, there is an unsolvable problem, when a user can see an advertisement on a resource, for example, from a mobile phone, and then directly go to the site from the desktop.  In this situation, to trace such a lead is not possible.  Such losses, although they exist, are not so great.  This can be treated differently, but in fact, this is the inevitable payment for the most honest scheme of the lead-payment, in which the advertiser gets real benefit. </blockquote><br>  Offer Hamster Marketplace offers: <br><br><ul><li>  guaranteed payout of $ 3; </li><li>  additional deduction in the amount of 16% of the purchase amount. </li></ul><br>  Deductions from the amount of the transaction are generally normal practice, but in the application to the crowdsale, this item starts to play with new colors, because the lead can buy tokens for both $ 10 and $ 10,000, which is akin to a kind of jackpot for the webmaster.  By the way, as practice shows, large purchases of tokens are more often made at the presale stage due to a very attractive discount. <br><br>  At the same time, partnership with RunCPA is also a plus in karma: any advertiser who comes to the site undergoes a primary audit, within the framework of which its cleanliness is evaluated.  This is what Ivan said about this: <br><br><blockquote>  In theory, we have to start offering all advertisers indiscriminately, because our function is to reduce advertiser and webmasters.  However, since we are focused on a rather specific niche of cryptoeconomics, it was decided to check with whom webmasters will have to deal with in terms of advertisers.  Our team conducts a primary audit, not to say that it is very tough, but sufficient to cut off obvious fraudsters and scammers.  This helps us not only in the reputational terms, but also ensures that our webmasters work relatively smoothly: after all, if they place an offer to fraudsters, it will hurt the reputation of their own resources. </blockquote><br><h3>  It is not necessary to postpone </h3><br>  Presale Hamster Marketplace will end on December 31 or earlier if the limit of tokens allocated to it is sold out.  At the same time, the discount will start to decrease even earlier - up to 10% from December 20 and 5% from December 26.  But the increased discount applies to large purchases: -30%, if you buy Hamster Marketplace tokens in the amount of $ 2000 and -40% - from $ 5000. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>If you want to get more information about Hamster Marketplace first hand, welcome to our <a href="https://t.me/hmstrRU">Russian-language channel in Telegram</a> .</b></i>  <i><b>You can take part in the pre-sale of HMT tokens on the <a href="https://hmstr.io/">official</a> project <a href="https://hmstr.io/">website</a> .</b></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345072/</a></p>
