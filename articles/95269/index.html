Looking ahead a bit, let's say - such situations are entirely relevant to the layout.  Deciding to open your business - we did not go bankrupt, no.  But they realized that it was not worth a damn.  So, gaining experience and making a few observations, we decided to share them with Habr. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is no secret that many IT people are inspired by the well-known personalities of the western IT world: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Stolmann, Linus, Twitter startup creators, HabraHabra, Vkontakte, Engadget and many other people and services.  For us, the p2h.com guys have become such ‚Äúmotivators‚Äù - these people seem to be ordinary, but for how many years they have been doing only layout and live quite well.  We wanted too.

    <h4>  Meeting with the beautiful. </h4><br>  We really like the layout.  It is magic - and the code itself, with the proper approach, becomes a wonderful creation of man.  So we decided to create a business in Russia similar to p2h.com and which will only work for layout - to supply consumers with a good code that is normal and meets all the requirements of customers.  Having accumulated capital, we decided to open the site (the lair of the virtual business), and with it LLC (paying taxes in due time and keeping accounting records, entering into contracts and other official business businesses) - and at the same time developing and clarifying the procedure registration of the company, began activities on "tampering portfolio" on freelancing.  Work did not just go - it was boiling and smoking!  But one oddity was noticed.  More precisely, not strangeness, but the harsh reality of Russian business. <br><br>  The fact is that after working more than half a year on freelancing, stuffing portfolios, we noticed that no one has a desire to order the layout separately.  More precisely, such cases were - but they rather confirm the rule.  A serious disappointment has come - there is enough money only for bread and butter, and there are no serious orders and the desired hint of independent being, like in p2h.com.  There is no good demand for the layout - which means that our business is simply doomed to failure.  And now we are at a crossroads. <br><br>  As an epilogue, we want to say that we have not officially opened an enterprise.  Why?  Yes, it's just a noose around our neck.  Taxes, payment of duties and anything else - and at the same time the minimum possible demand for our services.  We will drown, and not having time to attract at least 10-20 clients. <br><br>  But we also didn‚Äôt know the answers to the questions: is it possible to deal en massely only with layout, if only units need it in Russia?  And how to deal with those who offer a turnkey website, already includes a layout in the range of services?  Cooperation with them is not the point we sought.  It turns out that the layout market is not in demand?  And just needed as an "outsourcing" of large web studios?  These questions we would like to puzzle the habrasoobschestvo. <br><br>  Published at the request of <a href="http://the-buddha.habrahabr.ru/">the-buddha.habrahabr.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95269/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95269/</a></p>
