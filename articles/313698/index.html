Somewhere pipes are deeply walled in walls, and somewhere they hang on ropes ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Different people built this sewage system, most of whom have been working in other places for a long time.  Most of the "founding fathers" grew up with this system - they studied, made mistakes, gained experience.  For many of them, this is their first ‚Äúso serious‚Äù system.  Now they are working in a new place and happy that they have forgiven their way of building. <br><br>  The owner of the building (the Company), as a rule, is sure that he himself has the best sewage system - it really copes well with its task, delivering where its content is needed.  But time does its job, and any system begins to fail: from the increased load (how many people there are), from the old age of pipes and valves, from curved service. <br><br>  Most of the "founding fathers" have grown with the system - their salary has grown with its growth, because they have learned well how to show the relationship between the volume of content in the pipes and their salary, and also, they have learned how to scare everyone with small and not so much : it burst here, fell there, does not work here - go to the next building ...

      But everything once comes to an end and the most wonderful sewer system fails - not all at once, but in parts: somewhere it will burst, something does not go away, somewhere something has overflowed ... And more and more often it affects the inhabitants of the house and even the most important of them.  All the incoming specialists had been fixing something somewhere, cleaning something, changing it, but this was not enough for a long time ... <br><br>  Old sewers can not be fixed completely.  It is impossible, it will always be the old sewer system.  You can somehow support it, but sooner or later it will still explode ... and you will have to wash everything for a long time and live in the house for a while will not work - there is no sewage system!  She rushed.  We all understand this well and vividly imagine.  We are all well aware of the fact that we need to build a new sewage system, using modern materials, modern design solutions and technologies.  We understand that it is impossible to use spare parts from the old in the new sewage system - otherwise it will turn out old again! <br><br>  But when it comes to the information system, the overwhelming majority of managers think that everything is different here: wizards will come in the person of the incoming sysadmin and everything will be fine.  Eternally, for many, many years everything will be fine. <br><br>  Will not be.  Sooner or later also explode.  And have to build a new system on the go.  The old information system, as well as the sewage system, cannot be turned into a new one, here you also need to build a new one, using new technological solutions, first designing it - after all, what kind of house (business) has been built! <br><br>  If you sometimes, not often even, drip or smell somewhere, you do not need to wait while it jerks: order an audit of the information system from sane people, just order.  Formulate actual problems corresponding to today's (and better tomorrow's) business, which the information system should solve and start building a new system, without delay, until the old one collapses. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313698/</a></p>
