Oracle today is highlighting machine learning (machine learning, ML) and artificial intelligence (artificial intelligence, AI) for cloud services, as well as the delivery of ‚Äúsmart applications‚Äù (smart applications) and data-driven decisions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sw/kf/qo/swkfqofzuaydw08zckomnz_0clg.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Representatives of the company assured that the new solution, the Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud (Autonomous Database Cloud, ADC) will be cheaper - and with the addition of the Oracle Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity System and more secure than any Amazon Web Services (AWS) product. <br><br>  How fair the Oracle comparisons are is still unknown, since the first release of the Oracle Autonomous Database will be available through the Data Warehouse Cloud Service only by the end of this year.

      <br>
      You can add a few more months here, while independent reviewers can conduct their own tests and compare new Oracle products with competing cloud services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tr/ie/gb/triegb3jywsgsqjrv_l_gc_68bo.jpeg"><br><br>  Some products announced at OOW17 are available today.  Among them are Oracle Big Data Cloud, Oracle Event Hub and Stream Analytics Cloud services, as well as Oracle Analytics Cloud Data Lake Edition. <br><br>  It is expected that within the next three to six months, a few more announcements of Oracle related to Adaptive Intelligent Apps, AI and ML will be published. They will use Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) technology and an updated Oracle Analytics Cloud.  Below are brief indicative information contained in these announcements. <br><br>  <b>Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud</b> <br><br>  Winning a cloud war is of course crucial for Oracle.  The company today has more than 480,000 customers worldwide, and its number one product is the Oracle Database.  Obviously, if the client is oriented towards Oracle's DBMS, then the choice of other related products will be associated with Oracle.  Therefore, Larry Ellison throughout the OOW17 demonstrated ‚Äúbetter-faster-cheaper‚Äù performance and cost of a new company offer. <br><br>  He also told participants that, taking into account discounts, database service prices will start from as little as $ 300 per month - although the minimum configuration with one CPU and one terabyte of RAM today does not seem to be quite sufficient for many applications to work. <br><br>  Oracle CEO Mark Hurd‚Äôs (Mark Hurd) talk was that today only about 14% of corporate workloads are placed in public clouds.  But, given the strong momentum of development, up to 80% of workloads will be in the cloud by 2025 <br><br>  In connection with the latest trends, the lion's share of today's database market, which is occupied by Oracle, may decrease.  Therefore, one of its main objectives is to distract customers from alternatives such as Amazon RedShift or Amazon Aurora. <br><br>  Low cost (according to Oracle) with high performance repeatedly emphasized throughout the OOW17.  They are the main weapon of Oracle in the fight for customers who are now considering options for placing their database in the cloud. <br><br>  At the same time, it is important for potential clients to clearly understand that the Oracle Oracle Autonomous Database is nothing more than a cloud-based service.  Oracle Database 18c software, which does not have much time left to be released, will not have the innate ability to work autonomously.  To get the autonomy property, the DBMS must be an Oracle service. <br><br>  The same applies to the local deployment option directly at the customer site (on-premise).  The DBMS will not be autonomous if it is not delivered according to the Cloud at Customer model, with the Oracle Cloud Machine, which is deployed in customer data centers, but is managed by Oracle. <br><br>  Oracle has for at least several years been talking about high efficiency, which can be obtained by automating the work of its products in the cloud.  Autonomous Database Cloud, according to company representatives, takes these advantages to a new level. <br><br>  <i>From the blog of Marina Savinova</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the opening of OOW17, Larry Ellison said that the new development of the corporation "is as revolutionary as the Internet."</i>  <i>This is the world's first 100% self-managed DBMS.</i>  <i>It uses machine learning algorithms and requires almost no administration and adjustment, eliminating the likelihood of error due to the ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù and functioning like self-driving cars.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Numerous system event logs generated by networks, servers, storage systems, virtual machines, operating systems, applications, analytics systems and databases act as data arrays for learning.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This will allow an autonomous database management system to detect anomalies in data and events, classify queries and automatically configure the database.</i>  <i>In addition, as Larry Ellison stressed, a very urgent problem of cyber security is being solved today: databases can protect themselves by detecting anomalous events.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>According to Allison, the product almost completely eliminates the manual labor of managing the database, significantly reducing costs, guarantees availability at 99.995% (no more than 30 minutes of downtime per year), consumes less system resources and has increased productivity due to automatic fine tuning.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Allison called this adaptive use of computational and storage resources "genuine elasticity."</i> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/russia/lje-autonomous-database">Link</a> <br><br>  Time will tell how much additional attractiveness will provide autonomy, managed on the principles of machine learning, and optimization in comparison with comparable services of Oracle 12c DBMS. <br><br>  <i>From the blog of Marina Savinova</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Nearly half of Larry Ellison‚Äôs presentation was devoted to comparing the Oracle Autonomous Cloud Database with the Oracle Database in the Amazon cloud and the Redshift Database in the Amazon cloud on demo examples using typical workloads.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>He noted that in the announced Amazon SLA, exceeding 99%, many planned and unplanned downtime are not taken into account.</i>  <i>Running the tests showed that using the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud for identical requests for the same data would cost 5‚Äì8 cheaper than using Oracle in the Amazon RDS cloud.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A similar test demonstrated that requests to data at the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud cost 15 times less than with Amazon Redshift, and this is without taking into account the reduction in labor costs due to the automation of Oracle DBMS</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúAmazon is five to eight times more expensive than a standalone Oracle database with the same workload,‚Äù said Larry Ellison.</i>  <i>Potentially, Amazon Data Warehouse customers can reduce their costs by 50% -80% by switching to the Oracle Autonomous Database.</i> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/russia/lje-autonomous-database">Link</a> <br><br>  However, with regard to comparing Oracle Database on Oracle Cloud with Oracle Database on Amazon, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/oracle-open-world-2017-9-announcements-to-follow-from-autonomous-to-ai/">ZDNet noted</a> that it is somewhat incorrect due to differences in data processing mechanisms.  More uniform is the comparison of Oracle DB on Exadata with Redshift on Amazon.  Here, independent test results would be more indicative. <br><br>  Of course, automation of the database based on ML-driven technology provides additional benefits.  But Oracle has other new features, including Autonomous OLTP (expected in June 2018), as well as the Autonomous NoSQL and Graph database service.  They will probably be shown on OOW18. <br><br>  <b>Oracle Adaptive Intelligent Apps</b> <br><br>  Last October, on OOW16, Oracle Adaptive Intelligent Apps, a family of ML cloud applications that were combined with Oracle cloud applications, were fairly quietly announced.  The company then spent the first half of 2016, creating the ‚Äúdata pipelines‚Äù required for ML. <br><br>  Using a combination of customer-oriented SaaS data and third-party enrichment data from the Oracle Data Cloud, Adaptive Intelligent Apps can provide clients with recommendations that improve current solutions and final business results. <br><br>  <i>From the blog of Marina Savinova</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Oracle Adaptive Intelligent Apps use Oracle Data Cloud analytics, the world's largest independent data marketplace with a collection of more than 5 billion global consumer and business user IDs, and more than 7.5 trillion.</i>  <i>data points collected monthly.</i> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.oracle.com/ru/corporate/pressrelease/oow17-oracle-ai-platform-cloud-services-20171002.html">Link</a> <br><br>  Today, customers can use Next Best Offers and Recommendations, a subset of Adaptive Intelligent Experiences for the Customer Experience (CX) Cloud. <br><br>  Already after the ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù presented at the previous conference, Oracle at OOW17 announced the release of Adaptive Intelligent Apps for HR, ERP and Supply Chain Management, but specific dates were not named.  During the same conference, the start of their deployment was reported by two companies - the Swedish Sportia and the Italian Moleskin. <br><br>  However, in October 2016, Oracle rather conservatively noted that these applications will debut "over the next 12 months."  Oracle‚Äôs main competitor on this front was, of course, Salesforce Einstein, which was intensively promoted in 2017. The testimony and deployment details from Salesforce Einstein customers could be heard at the next global Dreamforce conference on November 6-9 in San Francisco. <br><br>  So the new Oracle Adaptive Intelligent Apps will most likely appear no earlier than in the first quarter of 2018 and will debut in a limited edition.  They will include at least the following. <br><br>  <i>From the blog of Marina Savinova</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b>Oracle Mobile Cloud</b> includes interactive AI using bots to automate human interaction using natural language, mood, speech, images, and machine learning.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b>The Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud</b> includes machine learning for self-management and self-healing of data warehouses and OLTP loads, as well as to increase security and reliability.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b>Oracle Analytics Cloud</b> allows analysts to use machine learning methods to better visualize data and understand dependencies without becoming a developer.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b>Oracle Security and Management Cloud</b> includes built-in machine learning to automate the detection, prevention of threats, and response to security breaches, performance anomalies, and vulnerabilities.</i> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.oracle.com/ru/corporate/pressrelease/oow17-oracle-ai-platform-cloud-services-20171002.html">Link</a> <br><br>  <b>Oracle Big Data and AI Advances</b> <br><br>  Oracle, in some cases, is ahead of the market, and in some cases, it is somewhat lagging behind it when it comes to big data and advanced analytics.  So, this summer, Oracle announced the Oracle Big Data Cloud.  It is a Hadoop and Spark based big data platform.  It is also close to the ODPi standard that Hortonworks, Microsoft, and IBM use. <br><br>  The previous Oracle offer, the Big Data Appliance based on Cloudera, is still available as an on-premise solution or a hosting service.  But a further central product will no doubt be the Oracle Big Data Cloud, with separate data storage and processing systems.  The solution is offered as an inexpensive alternative for large-scale data lakes. <br><br>  The most recent addition to this solution is the Oracle Event Hub based on the open source product Apache Kafka, which performs the routing and data processing.  Another product, Oracle Stream Analytics, implements the newly rewritten event processing technology, which now runs on Apache Spark. <br><br>  Oracle President Thomas Kurian (Thomas Kurian) in his speech spoke about the new platform AI &amp; ML PaaS.  It will offer users the computing power of the GPU (graphics processors, both for building infrastructure such as bare metal and for virtual machines), as well as various open source AI structures, including Caffe, Keras and Tensorflow.  Developers will be able to work with a variety of languages ‚Äã‚Äãand laptops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tq/0p/oy/tq0poyz8l1bvfmgrmocuxuqtp2u.jpeg"><br><br>  Oracle Big Data Cloud is already available and gives Oracle a good opportunity to compete with large information services, such as AWS and Microsoft Azure.  The Event Hub and Stream Analytics services are also available.  They fill the gap that competitors' products cover ‚Äî AWS Kinesis portfolio and Event Hubs and Stream Analytics on Microsoft Azure. <br><br>  As for AI &amp; ML PaaS, this platform was announced at OOW17, but it is not yet available to customers (according to the Oracle website), and is also expected to be within three to six months.  For its part, Microsoft launched the next generation of its next generation Azure Machine Learning portfolio in October, which promises continuous exemplary lifecycle management.  So, if you characterize the whole market picture in a few words, Oracle is still catching up with cloud AI services and their capabilities. <br><br>  <b>Oracle Analytics Cloud</b> <br><br>  This is another area where Oracle is moving fast to keep pace with the market.  The transition to Oracle BI Cloud Service and Oracle Visualization Cloud Service was announced three years ago.  Oracle Analytics Cloud combines these two services and adds new elements to it to get a more comprehensive set covering data discovery (data discovery), their preparation (preparation), analysis and forecasting. <br><br>  Oracle announced Data Lake Edition on OOW17, with subscriptions based on the number of CPUs used, rather than the number of users, thus ensuring wide acceptance of the concept.  Subscriptions for Standard and Enterprise Edition were available earlier. <br><br>  Oracle also announced a series of ML-based extensions and natural-language-processing for Oracle Analytics Cloud.  They will also be available in the next three to six months. <br><br>  <b>Automatic data analysis (Automated Data Diagnostics)</b> "explains" the abilities that will show hidden engines, and lead users to data and analytics, which they would not be able to obtain in any other way. <br><br>  <b>Natural Language Insights</b> provides <b>insights into the</b> hidden points and meanings of plain text, helping the user to focus on specific issues. <br><br>  <b>Improved "questions" based on queries in natural language (Natural Language Query)</b> support synonyms and abbreviations.  They can dynamically correct and reinterpret the user's requests that he enters. <br><br>  Oracle is also working on Enhanced Data Catalog capabilities, including searching and navigating through metadata and social media tags ‚Äî as well as through automated recommendations on relevant and relevant data sets to perform data discovery. <br><br>  From all of the above, we can conclude that Oracle Analytics Cloud seems to be on the path that Microsoft PowerBI and Azure ML are evolving.  In fact, all companies leading in this market segment have already created their own, fairly complete portfolios, and in every possible way strive to develop the capabilities of their clouds and data platforms. <br><br>  The updates and extensions announced at OOW17 mainly correspond to the set of modern abilities that are already available on the market.  For example, Oracle explained that the capabilities of its products are akin to BeyondCore Salesforce and the like included in Microsoft PowerBI.  The natural language insights of natural language are akin to Narrative Sciences, that is, the ‚Äúscience of the story,‚Äù which has already become part of the Qlik and Tableau software. <br><br>  In addition, the level of modern art of automatic processing of people‚Äôs natural language is quite high among a number of other major software companies, including Microsoft, IBM Watson Analytics, and others. <br><br>  <b>OOW17 - general impressions</b> <br><br>  Overall, the OOW17 conference impressed with the breadth of applications and technologies that Oracle announced.  Oracle may not always be the first to present new opportunities and breakthroughs.  But it always remains the main competitor in the field of DBMS and data platform providers. <br><br>  The company's presence in the data platform markets and related applications provides it with good positioning to also lead in the field of data analytics and the emerging ‚Äúsmart applications‚Äù of this class. <br><br>  The key question today can be formulated as follows: how, with so many developers these days, Oracle can be so successful as to initiate the transition of existing customers to the cloud.  So far, the most surprising phenomenon in the application software arena is how many completely new Oracle customers have gained through their SaaS applications. <br><br>  Mark Hurd insists that the company's main business (Oracle DBMS) is ahead of the rest of the market.  But this is the essence of licensing and subscriptions, while the large observed growth in cloud solutions can hardly be measured by the same metric (even if the software is supported commercially). <br><br>  Oracle Big Data, data integration and analytics, everything seems to be included in public cloud solutions today.  At OOW17, one could see a wide range of open source software from Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, and Cassandra (the latter in partnership with Datastax);  programming languages ‚Äã‚ÄãPython, R, as well as various open source structures for deep learning. <br><br>  Oracle's bravado about its commercial offerings is unlikely to ever end in the foreseeable future.  But it should be recognized that the company is moving more and more smoothly with the leaders of the rapidly changing world of data platforms and technologies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344230/</a></p>
