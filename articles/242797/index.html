  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Publisher List for Mobile Game Developer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I want to share with beginners and continuing developers of mobile games list of publishers, which is in the process of their own searches. <br><br>  Some lyrics.  I am a developer of mobile games.  With the help of a small indie team we are developing a small, rather hardcore game in the style of "two locks" for mobile phones.  A couple of months ago, we did get to the point where it was necessary to determine the choice of publisher. <br><br>  At this stage, I had to spend a lot of time sifting existing <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc%3Fkey%3D0As1joqDAfz6UdHhhQ3lMZ0oyZXZRRGFQZXdHTGZEYnc">lists</a> and <a href="http://dtf.ru/company/search.php%3Fsearch%3D1%26name%3D%26activity_id%3D5%26location_id%3D%26alive%3D1%26outsource%3D%26sort%3Dreg_date%26set_ps%3D1%26page_size%3D50">sites</a> , making the most comprehensive list.  I want to share my best practices with beginners and continuing developers of mobile games.  I hope this will be useful to someone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A few words about how we organized the search for the publisher.  Letters with proposals were sent in two stages - first, at the level of the alpha version, testing those who might in principle be interested.  Then, after a couple of months, having reached the beta version, we conducted another ‚Äúround‚Äù of the newsletter, looking for specific proposals.  The strategy yielded certain results, we managed a suitable publisher, with whom we are currently working.  So far so good.

      In order to make it easier to navigate the list, I assigned a rating to each company.  Immediately I warn you - this is a purely subjective mark!

Although they were on the DNF publisher lists. <br><br>  <a href="http://i-pnt.ru/">iPoint</a> Rating: D. Moscow.  A small company, the site is terrible, the portfolio is weak.  But the publishers. <br><br>  <a href="http://planemostd.com/">Planemo Studio</a> <br>  Rating: D. Moscow.  Not publishers, projects are pretty weak.
