  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Seven inches from Google</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If Goolge wants to create a gadget from scratch, it can do it - this is understandable.  But the fact that the development of the Nexus 7 took only four months was a discovery for me!  The production of this gadget Internet giant ordered from ASUS.  And according to the developers, the task before them was incredibly difficult.  Specialists in different parts of the world worked around the clock in three shifts.  However, the fact that they eventually turned out, I would not call the device, which was done in a hurry "on the knee."  The pill was surprisingly very thoughtful. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lU4roeDmzMI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgRHkAEzFZKGcA0-ffj5ndCFbpu5A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  In the States, the tablet is worth 200 dollars.  And even we have the official price for it only ten thousand rubles.  But at the same time, the Google tablet turned out to be one of the most high-quality and powerful ‚Äúseven-inches‚Äù that I met.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/14c/860/d58/14c860d58df9c0c3d7354ee57608b7da.jpg"><br><br>  Nexus 7 should compete in the US market with ultra-cheap Kindle and Barns &amp; Noble devices - this is on the surface.  And to reduce the cost of the device used here is not metal, although this would make it stronger and more attractive in the eyes of potential buyers.  Instead of metal, it used textured plastic "to the point", which is very pleasant to the touch and somewhat reminiscent of soft-touch, although it is slightly firmer.  And even the edging also turned out to be plastic, although it was made ‚Äúunder the metal‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52b/c78/934/52bc7893402bab9e954debfdae1a7694.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The front panel is completely covered with Corning protective glass, which is supposedly not scratched.  For about three weeks I wore a tablet in a backpack without a case, and it seems to be still safe and sound ... Even with a border, the silver coating did not come off, although it has rather sharp corners that suffer first. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/151/4b8/399/1514b8399d9b6671ef7c9173ed3b1755.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are only three buttons on the device - it is an on / off key and a volume control on the right side.  Below there was a place for the micro-USB connector and audio jack.  A microphone is located at the top, and under a wide speaker, there is space on the rear panel. <br><br>  I must say that I had no complaints about the assembly.  The gadget is assembled from several plastic parts, but all of them are carefully fitted to each other.  The design seems monolithic. <br><br>  And still seven-inch Nexus reliably lies even in one hand.  He pulls only 340 grams, so it can be held on weight for a long time without any problems. <br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  The seven-inch Nexus 7 display is made using IPS technology.  He has no problems with viewing angles, and the color and contrast at a height.  The resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels, which on this diagonal gives a density of 216 pixels per inch.  Not Retina, but personally I don‚Äôt see individual pixels :) <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  In addition to the screen, the tablet also turned out to be advanced iron.  It is built on the basis of the NVIDIA Tegra 3 chipset. This includes a quad-core processor with a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz, a gigabyte of RAM and graphics of the ULP GeForce.  The main memory in a tablet can be from eight to sixteen gigabytes, depending on the modification. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d27/a9f/773/d27a9f7733acd1dbd0baf142cae01275.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the Quadrant Standart test, this configuration gains about 3300 points, which puts the Google gadget next to the original ASUS design - Transformer Prime.  And he, I would say, is considered to be the most productive among Android tablets. <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  The Nexus 7 has only one camera, and its resolution is 1.2 megapixels.  It is located on the front of the device, and it turns out that it can only be used for video calls.  However, the 720p picture is pretty good in Skype and Google Video Chat. <br><br><h4>  Connection </h4><br>  Wireless connectivity is provided by Wi-Fi b / g / n, Bluetooth, as well as the increasingly popular NFC.  3G, unfortunately not, and vague rumors that such a modification will appear soon, I still have not been confirmed.  Otherwise, such a tablet would be perfect among all seven-inch models. <br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  The gadget works on Google Android 4.1.  He is Jelly Bean.  There is improved energy consumption, and reworked the notification system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/610/387/b9e/610387b9e1a9eaa99d89fe3c12c9b447.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Tablet version 4.1 can even rotate the contents of desktops.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7aa/846/d5e/7aa846d5e1a10ea0ee23b55abf3ed492.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All embedded widgets can be stretched and compressed as needed by the user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da2/4d3/d61/da24d3d61739906fe7f2ef1a46075038.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The keyboard has finally got a separate button to change the language.  This is much more convenient than permanently clamping a space and choosing a layout from the list. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1be/d80/d91/1bed80d916bfcbdeffc5feb9886f4868.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can not even use the clave, and dictate the text out loud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21f/032/2f7/21f0322f7a20be8f04bb47c60b4b5030.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Moreover, the system also understands Russian, and can even record it without connecting to the Internet - for this you will need to download a language pack of 15 megabytes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/018/292/71a/01829271a723aebc9a42647f9a26b467.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And for dessert, Google offers a digital assistant.  He can be given voice commands, but even without them he will send the user up-to-date information based on data obtained from his search history and movements.  And I must say that this assistant is learning, and gradually begins to frighten me.  I was looking for the exact address of the Floor on Tverskaya just now.  Naturally, through Chrome, and, of course, with the synchronization of several devices through my account.  So when I then took the tablet in my hands, Android in the notification panel showed me the route to Tverskaya 14 and the estimated time, taking into account traffic jams!  0_o <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46a/286/124/46a28612425fab4cf9e3ec5b899fe951.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  The tablet is equipped with a battery capacity of 4325 mAh.  This allows him to work without recharging for about 9 hours in the mode of viewing HD video, 10 hours in reading mode or web browsing, and, if Google is to be believed, more than 12 days in idle mode.  This result is partly due to the lack of a 3G module in the device, but given the powerful stuffing, the result is still bearable. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Google, selling Nexus 7, obviously does not receive excess profits.  But users can buy a powerful device for sane money.  Only the Internet giant will not be left behind, believe me ... In return, he gets something more expensive than money - your loyalty;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a06/2b9/934/a062b9934bbcc21ae5f067d295bfbe2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Specs </h4><br>  <b>OS:</b> Android 4.1 Jelly Bean <br>  <b>Processor:</b> NVIDIA Tegra 3, 1.5 GHz <br>  <b>Video:</b> GeForce ULP <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 1 GB <br>  <b>Main memory:</b> 8-16 GB, no microSD slot <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 7 ", TFT IPS, 800 x 1280 <br>  <b>Communications:</b> Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, Bluetooth, NFC, USB 2.0 <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> USB (USB Host), 3.5mm audio jack <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 1.2 megapixels.  for video calls <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS, GPS <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 4325 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 198.5 x 120 x 10.5 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 340 grams <br>  <b>Price:</b> 9990 for 16 GB </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155155/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155155/</a></p>
