The name of the rubric changed, the concept changed, and only my favorite author, A. Khaletsky.  not changed, but continues with increased enthusiasm to carry the reasonable, good, eternal to the masses.  The masses happily make noises and throw their caps into the air.  Yes, I love you all too, less, of course, than Christopher, Malyzhenkov, Bardiyan, Haiko, Oakley and Poznyak, but still.  After love, people usually smoke and drink coffee, and we will see what happens in the blogging world. <br><br>  Our monstrous portal, which will soon become a universal tao and incorporate the whole real world felt in general, took up blogs too.  Last week, some of the lucky ones, including myself, managed to go to <a href="http://blogs.tut.by/">blogs.tut.by</a> and see the rubricator and even a few registered blogs.  Now at this address you will be asked for authorization and will get an error 401. Apparently, the service itself is still being tested.  But, for example, at <a href="http://blog.blog.tut.by/">blog.blog.tut.by</a> , you can already read the ‚ÄúBlog about blogs‚Äù and see how the new service will look like.  Although, if you have seen Wordpress, you can assume that blogs have seen on tut.by.  Because there they decided not to show off especially by writing their own blog engine, but took it checked and free.  More precisely, it is free for ordinary users, tut.by probably had to pay for a multi-user license.  The only thing that upsets me in this whole story is that late ‚ÄúHere‚Äù took up blogs.  Although the lag more than six months from the "Rambler" and mail.ru for Belarus can not be considered so much.  Regular visitors to the tut.by forums and mail users are likely to taste the new service.  After all, it‚Äôs not enough to understand livejournal and, especially, stand-alone blogs.  But serious bloggers are unlikely to use blogs.tut.by, even though WordPress.  After all, it's like after gmail register on mail.tut.by.  Although, only time will tell if I am right.

      Almost simultaneously with tut.by, our other monster Akavita paid attention to blogs.  Probably, ‚ÄúAkavite‚Äù was tired of envying Google and ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù, and therefore earned a <a href="http://blogs.akavita.by/">search on Belarusian forums and blogs</a> .  As stated on <a href="http://blogs.akavita.by/">the</a> service <a href="http://blogs.akavita.by/">page</a> , the search is carried out on Belarusian blogs in the systems livejournal.com, blog.inf.by, dnevnik.by, blog.tut.by, as well as numerous Belarusian forums.  It remains unclear how the Belarusian blog is defined, for example, on livejournal.com, and also how the officially disabled list of blog.tut.by got on this list.  Most likely, tut.by and Akavita closely cooperate.  Most likely, tut.by even financed the creation of a search for Belarusian blogs, which is understandable in connection with the emergence of its own blog service.  Naturally, I immediately made a search by my last name.  Akavita issued 8 blogs against 37 for Google and 86 for Yandex.  True, Akavita honestly chose only Belarusian resources.  So let's wish good luck to such a good undertaking, especially since it promises to constantly improve itself. <br><br>  And on Yandex, the blog <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/">search page</a> has been updated.  Now it is a powerful Russian-language statistical resource.  First, the so-called ‚ÄúTag Cloud‚Äù or, in the interpretation of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù, ‚ÄúPopular Categories‚Äù appeared.  We are shown a list of the most popular categories that blog authors set for their posts.  The more they wrote on this topic, the larger and fatter the category name.  True, we will not see any revelations there, the fattest inscriptions are photos, music and humor.  I will add only that the list is calculated in the last 24 hours.  Another more interesting, in my opinion, list is popular posts.  According to Yandex, this is the ‚Äúlist of entries that most interested bloggers in the last 24 hours.  It is determined automatically based on the number of links to the post among other bloggers, the number of comments, the authoritativeness of the blogger, as well as other parameters. ‚Äù  At <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/top">blogs.yandex.ru/top</a> you will find not only the ranking of blogs, but also the opportunity to check the position of your blog.  Yandex claims that ‚Äúthe rating is based on credibility ‚Äî an integral indicator based on how often other bloggers refer to the blog in question, who exactly is linking, the number of comments on the blog, the number of blog readers known to us, as well as other data about the blog and its position in the blogosphere. "  My blog is constantly hanging around the ten thousandth place, going down and rising to three thousand positions every day.  By the way, you can now put yourself in the ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù buttons, which show your place in the rating and the number of entries that refer to you.  All for narcissism!  These are not all additions on ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù, but the rest does not deserve a place on the pages of ‚ÄúKV‚Äù, I suggest you familiarize yourself with the innovations. <br><br>  <strong>And at this time ...</strong> <br><br>  ... the creator of LiveJournal arrives in Russia, as reported by lenta.ru.  Brad Fitzpatrick, founder of the most popular blogging service Livejournal.com, was supposed to come to Moscow from October 17 to 23, 2006.  In his blog, Fitzpatrick <a href="http://brad.livejournal.com/2257134.html">asked for advice</a> from Russian LiveJournal users on what sights to visit.  The creator of LiveJournal was advised to visit various places, ranging from fast foods in the center of Moscow to major museums.  The Russians did not miss the opportunity to make fun of Fitzpatrick and said that bears and skinheads walk the streets of the capital, and all the police are recruited by criminal gangs. <br><br>  ... on Sunday (October 15) on Vesti channel a new program appeared.  Well-known blogger radio host Alexander Plyushev will lead a program called Vesti.net.  Alexander <a href="http://plushev.livejournal.com/1213988.html">has already announced the</a> start of the new project in his LiveJournal.  More details about the transfer of Alexander told in an interview with <a href="http://internet.ru/news/2006-10-14955">internet.ru</a> . <br><br>  ... Christian news digest JesusChrist.ru <a href="http://jesuschrist.ru/news/2006/10/15/11570">reports</a> that the Lord‚Äôs American Reform Church considers blogging to be a sin on a par with children‚Äôs alcoholism and love relationships among teenagers.  Here is an eloquent quote: " <em>Blogging often lightens the mood of the user and makes a person think that his opinion is interesting to someone - when in fact all this is meaningless chatter</em> ."  True, not all blogs are considered sinful, but only those that are conducted by non-specialists and non-professionals.  The rest of the bloggers should support communication in ‚Äúold-fashioned‚Äù ways.  I wonder who will determine the professionalism of the blog? <br><br>  ... a blogger known as LiveJournal published a book.  This would be an ordinary event if this book did not consist entirely of records that the twilight had left in his LJ for two years.  Of course, the recordings were not about the fact that the blogger ate for breakfast, but quite artistic.  "The Book of Nathaniel" - this is the name you will be looking for on the book collapse.  Maybe I should publish a book?  It is a pity that you have to write it first. <br><br>  ... the B-2 group, which released the new album Moloko at the beginning of October, opened the <a href="http://moloko-b2.livejournal.com/">moloko</a> Russian-language blog, completely dedicated to the newly baked disc, which I found out on the website interweb.ru.  Moreover, the musicians are using Internet services with might and main, so anyone can download new band videos from <a href="http://myspace.com/b2band">MySpace</a> .  That would be our pop stars learned to use computers!  The last sentence does not apply to J-Morse and domestic electronics engineers, who have long used all the delights of virtual civilization.  By the way, a good topic for one of the following articles is a review of blogs of famous people of Belarus. <br><br>  ... A 14-year-old American schoolgirl was questioned with passion by two employees of the US Secret Service, after it turned out that the girl was calling for the assassination of President George W. Bush from the pages of her diary, reports <a href="http://webplanet.ru/news/security/2006/10/17/victim.html">webplanet.ru</a> .  Naturally, the girl simply showed teenage maximalism and protested against the war in Iraq.  However, this is not considered mitigating circumstances and the girl was interrogated for 15 minutes, bringing her to tears.  Do you also think that Americans have nothing to do? <br><br>  Today I consider my mission completed, write letters, read blogs, love hamsters. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006420602.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ42, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288060/</a></p>
