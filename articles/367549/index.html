At the same time, the opportunity is not enough, you still need to be willing to search for us, which is unlikely, because if they are already so developed that they can control the space-time continuum, will we find something interesting for them so that they had a desire to get acquainted with us, so that they suddenly wanted to shake hands with ‚Äúthemselves‚Äù people.  The maximum that they will do is to study the responses to the environment and certain factors and peculiarities of the processes of interaction of the environment on us, as more stupid as we do with laboratory rats. <br>  ‚ÄúHow often do you want to stop and start a dialogue with a worm?‚Äù  Maybe you, of course, stopped to talk to him, but you didn‚Äôt expect him to answer you? ‚Äù(C) Neil de Grasse Tyson is a famous astrophysicist and popularizer of science. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99f/571/876/99f571876b06466b872615c35c3ba97a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <i><b>Let's return to the topic of the article.</b></i>  <i><b>Mathematical explanation</b></i> </h5><br><br>  To understand why we see galaxies so clear, unlike Pluto, we need to understand what the angular resolution of the camera is and the ratio of the distance from the object to its size. <br><br>  Angular resolution is the ability of an eye, telescope, microscope, camera, etc., to recognize the details of another object.  Angular resolution is usually measured in angular seconds. <br><br>  1 degree = 3600 arcseconds <br><br>  The moon, for example, takes in our sky 1800 angular seconds, ie 0.5 degrees <br><br>  <i><b>Moon</b></i> <br>  To make it clear to everyone what we are talking about, let's consider the moon for comparison. <br>  Moon 3476 km in diameter, the average distance to the Earth 384,000 km <br>  The full moon covers 1800 angles of the sky;  0.5 degrees <br><br>  Knowing this, we can calculate the size of the object that you can see on the Moon from the Earth with your own eyes. <br><br>  It's very simple: take the diameter of 3476 km, divide it by the amount of 1800 angles per second, which the Moon covers in the sky and we get = 1.93 <br><br>  1.93 is the number of kilometers, showing how large the resolution is 1 arc-second (based on the diameter and distance to the moon) <br><br>  1.93 multiply by the angular resolution of your eyes 60 and get = 115.8 km <br>  The minimum object that you can see with your own eyes on the moon from Earth will be ~ 116 km in size. <br>  Remove the moon further away from us, leaving the diameter the same - it will cover less angular seconds in the sky, and you will see less and less details as the moon moves away. <br><br>  <i><b>Hubble Camera</b></i> <br>  Both images - Pluto and galaxies, shown at the beginning of the article, were taken ‚Äúon the wide-angle camera 3 ‚Ä≥ (TWC3) Hubble <br>  The resolution of this camera = 0.05 angular seconds <br>  The main Hubble mirror is 2.4 meters in diameter, which means that using the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0"><sup>wiki's</sup></a> limit limit formula we learn that it will be equal to 0.05 angle seconds, which is much better than the resolution of the human eye (60 vs. 0.05, less is better) <br>  Multiplying the already calculated value of 1.93 by the angular resolution of Hubble (0.05), we find that the Hubble can see an object on the Moon ~ 100 m in size (against the human eye ~ 116 km) <br><br>  <i><b>Pluto</b></i> <br>  The angular diameter of Pluto is only 0.115 ang.  s (in close proximity with the Earth) is very small, despite the fact that its size is only 2400 km in diameter <br>  (2400 km in diameter) / (4.280 million km) = 0.00000056 (4.280 million km is the distance in the closest approach to the Earth, as mentioned above in the article) <br><br>  This means that the minimum object that Hubble can view on Pluto must be no less than 1029 km in size (2368 / 0.115 = 20.600 km. | 20.600 * 0.05 = 1029 km) <br>  That is, with a telescope resolution of 0.05 arc seconds, Pluto will consist of 2 pixels, since 1029 km is almost half the size of the entire planet. <br><br>  Separating the ratio of Pluto to the Hubble angular resolution of 0.05 converted to radians 2.42406841 √ó 10 ^ -7 we get <br>  0.00000056 / 0.00000024 = 2.3 resolution (px) <br><br>  <i><b>Galaxy Andromeda</b></i> <br>  (260,000 light years in diameter) / (distance to it is 2 million light years) = 0.13 (the ratio of the diameter to the distance to us) <br>  1 degree = 3600 angles seconds (angular seconds) <br>  In our sky, it takes 10,800 coal.  sec. i.3 degrees (the moon takes 0.5 degrees, that is, the moon in our sky is 6 times smaller than Andromeda) <br><br>  We do the same, divide the calculated ratio by the Hubble angular resolution in radians 2.42406841 √ó 10 ^ -7 <br>  0.13 / 0.00000024 = ~ 541 600 resolution (px) <br><br>  And, like this, she looks in the photo of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/2a1pf3/andromeda_galaxy_and_part_of_the_disc_of_the">Cory Poole <sup>Reddit</sup></a> (the <a href="">original is larger</a> ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1aa/c00/4d8/1aac004d8d0a4fa0aebc5711a6ad103e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With Andromeda, everything is clear, but what if you take a more distant galaxy, one of the earliest educated galaxies, for example, the EGS-zs8-1 galaxy, which is 6550 times further than the Andromeda galaxy <br><br>  EGS-zs8-1 is 13.1 billion light years from us (the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years) <br>  This is the furthest distance ever measured from the earth to another galaxy.

And in the ratio of their distance from us with their size, (as shown above, the ratio is only 0.13 against the ratio of Pluto = 0.00000056), give us the opportunity to take such beautiful pictures, even with such an outdated telescope like Hubble.  Soon he will be replaced, the James Web Web telescope will come out, then we will be able to see the galaxies in even greater detail. <br><br>  As we already understood, Andromeda occupies 6 times more ‚Äúspace‚Äù (degrees) in our sky than the Moon, and <b>if</b> Andromeda were brighter, we would see it in our sky <br><br> <i><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce9/18e/5fd/ce918e5fde984057a23a3b011b8d941a.png" alt="image"><br></i>  <i><a href="https://youtu.be/mQ0hS7l9ckY"><sup>YouTube YouTube</sup></a> 5:35</i> <br><br>  Even if we consider the galaxy <a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1112a/">NGC 5584</a> , located 70 million light years from us, which is 35 times farther from Andromeda, it will still be ~ 1200 times more detailed than Pluto, because, despite its great distance from us, the ratio of diameter and distance is about 1200 times greater than those of Pluto (0.00069 / 0.00000056 = ~ 1200) <br><br>  I hope at least not many people have helped in understanding why modern telescopes can make an incredibly beautiful picture of a galaxy or nebula (for example, <a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic0515a/">such</a> or one <a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/archive/zoomable/">of these</a> TOP 100 Hubble photos) <br>  but they cannot show a sufficiently detailed photograph of Pluto or some of the other planets of our solar system. <br><br><h5>  <i><b>At last</b></i> </h5><br>  <i>What is interesting to see about space:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I recommend everyone to watch just the epic series "Space: Space and Time" <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/762381/"><sup>Kinopoisk</sup></a> (Continuation of the famous series of Karl Sagan)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>View in HD / fullHD can be on cxz.to or using <a href="https://popcorntime.io/">popcorntime</a> (only in English)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(not advertising)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>For those who know English and who are interested: below, under the spoiler, a stunning video from NASA about the device - the discoverer of new horizons, which after half a month, will give us the opportunity to see our 9th planet for the first time - Pluto (instead of a blurred point on a picture of several gray pixels that we have now)</i> <i><br></i> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video from NASA (58 minutes)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJxwWpaGoJs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhX5FSRKThsE4BIkUVTVGvzRnByQg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><br><h5>  <b>Poll</b> </h5></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367549/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367549/</a></p>
