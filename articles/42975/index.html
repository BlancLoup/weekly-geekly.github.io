  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Children and computer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So I decided to write my first article on Habr.  Though in a personal blog, as green is still :).  I do not hurt much.  I think I will not say anything new, but nevertheless some information can be very useful.  Especially parents who are concerned about the health of their offspring. <br><br>  Surely no one will argue that the computer affects your eyesight pretty negatively.  In any case, when he is busy with work related to the tension of his eyes, his eyes get tired quickly, maybe they even start to water.  The problem of people whose work is connected with a computer can be compared with truckers who are on the road for a long time.  Or also by people who somehow can not break away from the book.  To explain it simply - the muscles that control the work of the eyes and focus them on a particular object, just get tired of overload.  Potentially, the eyes may become tired of any work in which vision is involved, but it is greatest where you need to look at an object at close range. <br><br>  The problem increases even more if such activity is associated with the use of high-brightness devices, for example, the same computer monitor.  TV affects less on muscle fatigue, since the distance is usually quite acceptable.  In children, and also to a lesser extent in adolescents, their eyes often get tired, because they are not yet fully strengthened, continue to grow.  Therefore, parents should limit the time of the game in the COP and WoW :).  As each parent can confirm, these consequences do not necessarily arise only when working at a computer.  When children overdo it in any activity, they often become irritable, for example, after performing lessons for a long time.  If your child is more excited than usual, and there is no other obvious reason for this, then this may well be due to his long stay at the computer.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Excessive computer enthusiasm can also exacerbate existing eye problems.  Many children suffer from minor visual impairment, which can be regarded as minor problems.  Over time, vision correction will be needed here, but medicine intervention may be avoided before reaching adolescence or adulthood.  But if children are too keen on computers, they spend all their free time playing games, then this minor problem can turn into something more that will require correction at an early age.  Fortunately, most of these problems can be avoided quite easily due to parental controls. <br><br>  Here are some simple recommendations: <br><br>  1. <b>Limit the amount of time a child spends at a computer without a break</b> .  It is recommended to take a short break after every 15-20 minutes of work behind the monitor.  And it is better to limit the time of work per day to 1-1.5 hours.  The ideal discharge can be some kind of physical activity that does not require eye strain.  Some experts offer eye exercises that help children avoid problems associated with using a computer.  It can be such simple exercises as, for example, tracking objects moving in the field of view, or concentrating sight on distant objects, abrupt change of distance from distant objects to near ones and vice versa. <br><br>  2. It is not bad to <b>diversify the nature of the child‚Äôs classes at the computer</b> .  For example, games can be alternated with reading texts.  Such an alternation will require from young eyes completely different behavior with different behavior of objects on the screen and will prevent their rapid fatigue caused by a long concentration of vision on the same thing.  Another way to reduce the risk of visual impairment is to choose a good monitor, best of all with a high resolution.  They are always more comfortable for our eyes than low resolution monitors. <br><br>  3. If you and your children are going to sit at the computer for a long time, then you need to have <b>a high-definition display</b> .  It is very important to take measures to reduce reflections from the monitor.  Bright or uneven lighting in the room can cause unpleasant reflections on the screen.  Possible solutions to this problem include turning off the overhead light, drawing curtains off windows that let in too bright light, and turning the monitor in such a way that there are no bright light sources in front of it or in the back.  If it is disturbing to reflect from the monitor or its own brightness, then a special anti-glare screen can be installed in front of it. <br><br>  If, despite all these precautions, your child still complains of a headache, if his eyes become inflamed and itchy, or if he suddenly has difficulty reading or other school work, if he becomes agitated or aggressive, then need to show it to an ophthalmologist.  Do not forget to report at the same time that you have a computer at home, and tell how much time the child spends with it.  It is very important.  The doctor can prescribe special exercises for the eyes or pick up a child's glasses, designed specifically for work at an average distance characteristic of a computer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42975/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42975/</a></p>
