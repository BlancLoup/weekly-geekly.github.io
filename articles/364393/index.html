      Only a certified TOEFL center that has the relevant permission from the ETS organization has the right to take the exam and issue a certificate.  Such institutions are in almost every major city of the Russian Federation and take more than 50 exams per year.  Students can find out all the addresses of testing centers on the <a href="http://www.ets.org/toefl">official website</a> .  However, before visiting the TOEFL test center, each applicant must register online and pay for this service. <br><br>  TOEFL registration is carried out on the ETS website and is available around the clock.  The applicant is required to create an account and enter their personal data.  Then in your personal account you need to select the date and the nearest TOEFL center, thereby issuing a record for the exam.  It is necessary to register a maximum of 4 months and no later than 7 days before the selected date.  However, it should be noted that the registration procedure is considered incomplete without making payment. <br><br>  You can pay for the TOEFL passage in the same personal account on the ETS website.  The standard cost of the service is $ 250.  You can pay for them online using a MasterCard or Visa card.  It should be remembered that in addition to a fixed amount, there are additional tariffs.  For example, when registering for the test for 3 days before the selected date, the candidate will have to pay an additional 35 dollars.  Also, transfer of the exam and other services of the center are additionally paid. <br><br>  An important point during registration is the accuracy of personal data provided when filling out the registration card.  This concerns not only the name, but also other information.  To pass the exam, the candidate will need to provide the test center staff with a passport (other documents are not accepted).  If the data in it will differ from those that were specified in the registration form, the student will simply not be allowed to test.  Scanned copy of the document is not accepted - you must bring the original.  Also expired or invalid documents are not allowed.  Passport must be with your photo and signature. <br>  All centers are equipped with computer equipment and serviced by specially trained personnel.  At the same time, the procedure for passing the test itself is completely depersonalized, which contributes to the maximum objectivity of the test results. <br><br>  The test takes place in the morning in a fairly spacious room, around the perimeter of which computers are located.  Those who hand over are separated by a thin, opaque partition that helps to distance oneself from others and does not allow the handlers to interfere with each other.  It is especially important to work with the Speaking section, where candidates begin to slander the answer to the microphone almost simultaneously.  Sound insulation is carried out with the help of headphones and by and large is minimal - which can bring some discomfort to candidates with low concentration of attention. <br><br>  Test results are available in the online room approximately 10 days after the exam date.  The envelope with the printed version of the results is sent 13 days after the exam.  Delivery time in Moscow is about a month, in other cities of Russia, respectively, it may be longer. <br><br>  You can pass TOEFL in Russia only in iBT format.  The paper format was abolished in May 2012 and remains only in some countries where access to the Internet is restricted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba7/f84/5b5/ba7f845b5c544a2990905c3273e2382e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Before the exam</b> <br><br>  On the date appointed for registration, all candidates must come to the testing center at least half an hour before the start of the exam.  This time reserve is required for administrative procedures.  You should have an original passport with you, according to which the center staff can verify the identity of the candidate.  The document must contain a photo, full name and signature.  You will also need to pass personal things administration.  Everything you need to pass the test (headphones, draft, pencil) will be expected to be examined in a computer class where the exam will be held. <br><br>  <b>Testing procedure</b> <br><br>  The TOEFL handover starts from the <a href="http://toefl-test.ru/toefl-reading/">Reading</a> section.  On reading 3-4 texts and answers to 40 questions is given about an hour.  Immediately after completing this section, the candidate should begin the Listening assignments.  At this stage, you need to listen to about 6-9 audio materials (lectures, dialogues) and answer 35-50 questions.  It is necessary to cope with these tasks in 60 (3 texts) -80 minutes (4 texts) - the net time for an answer is 20 or 30 minutes.  Having passed two sections, the examinee can rest for 10 minutes. <br><br>  After a short break, the candidate will have to complete 6 tasks in the Speaking section.  It is necessary to give oral answers to the integrated and simple questions in 20 minutes, dictating them to the microphone.  After that, you can proceed to one of the most difficult sections of TOEFL - <a href="http://toefl-test.ru/toefl-writing/">Writing</a> .  At this final stage of testing, the candidate must write two essays (20 and 30 minutes).  You can learn more about the structure of the TOEFL test in <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/struktura-testa-toefl/">this</a> article. <br><br>  During the execution of tasks of different sections, you can make notes on paper.  In this case, the subjects need to remember that the test is based on American English and has time constraints.  Since most of the tasks are checked by a computer, all typos will be regarded as errors.  And this also should not be forgotten during the exam. <br><br>  So <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/gmat-obshchaya-informatsiya/">next time</a> we start talking about one of the most difficult exams - GMAT.  We will share with you all the secrets, features of passing and successful preparation for this test. <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364393/</a></p>
