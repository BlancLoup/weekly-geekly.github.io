The event was organized as part of a cycle of similar mini-conferences held throughout the country with the easy presentation of the Trader Media East media holding and the Pronto-Moscow media holding (they are also ‚ÄúHand to Hand‚Äù). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/343/d5b/82d/343d5b82d588e23fece7b2f027a261e6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The task of the conference was to talk about advertising on the Internet to ordinary Siberian businessmen, and also to promote at the same time saytic ‚ÄúFrom hand to hand‚Äù.  I attended the conference as a listener and was amazed at the very liver. <a name="habracut"></a>

      In my opinion, the whole cycle of conferences basically has: <br><ul><li>  unfounded concerns of the owners of the advertising business associated with a decrease in the impact of print advertising on consumers and, as a consequence, a fall in demand for it; </li><li>  understanding of the current moment and trends in the development of online advertising. </li></ul>  The conference was held in the conference hall of the Irkutsk hotel, where more than a hundred directors, managers, various department heads and advertising specialists gathered.  Also among the total mass one could meet a little more than a dozen representatives of IT companies in the city of Irkutsk.  It was also interesting for me to look at how events for businessmen are being held from the outside, that is, I was present as a fretting raspizdyay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/09a/a99/4df/09aa994dfc8e4040e9c03f7392fb23a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the registration, all distributed red "branded" badges.  True, from two steps it was almost impossible to read it, someone stands before you (yes, my badge was written by hand), but it was given out.  The girls smiled pleasantly and quickly, skillfully registered those who had come. <br><br>  All gathered and started.  After the first speech, there was not a single question.  The second report also ended in silence.  It seems that those who came were in a stupor, not a single question.  And no wonder.  On the slides there was some kind of business crap - a lot of numbers and text that were difficult to discern beyond the first row.  It seems that the first two speakers for the first time spoke to an audience of more than ten people.  They did not work at all with the audience, did not involve them in the process, did not create the prerequisites for discussion. <br><br>  On the third gig, I decided to shake the audience, which, like a spring, shrank and felt tension.  After the speech ‚ÄúSynergy of the Press and the Internet‚Äù, I got up and asked the troller question: ‚ÄúWhy do we need print ads now?‚Äù.  The girl - well done, not confused and quite lively repulsed, although she was clearly going to answer other questions.  Almost half of the hall turned to look at me, but the main thing - people relaxed.  They laughed a little, and then the listeners started asking questions, a pleasant discussion ensued. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f6/3bd/f54/2f63bdf54817a42f455952dc2d9f27dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next to me sat a guy who worked as a proofreader for a long time.  Along with him, we had presentations in which mistakes were encountered everywhere.  The first, in our general view, the almost perfect introduction was Maxim Goncharov's report, ‚ÄúThe tasks of the company's website.  Managing the company's website - independently or outsourcing? ". <br><br>  Maxim worked perfectly with the audience.  He managed to incorporate into his speech the knowledge of some of the conference participants and their business in the form of examples.  Knowledge he podcherpnul during past reports.  Maxim managed to get attention, concentration from the audience and at the same time streamline a fragmentary knowledge in the field of the web for many of them. <br><br>  You can not ignore one of the two main events at any conference - a coffee break.  Very expensive for the organizers, delicious for the participants and completely stupid for the majority, this coffee break was held.  Judge for yourself.  If you were a businessman and were going to a party, where more than 90% will also be businessmen, so that you take with you first of all?  BUSINESS CARDS!  You would take business cards with you to make useful contacts on the sidelines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/146/fb6/477/146fb64776d02b1c84176096a08e229b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As shown by the coffee break, business cards were at best every fifth to seventh.  In less than fifteen minutes I distributed a pack of thirty business cards, and I received only two.  We had a good talk and had a snack in between, and we returned to listen to the speeches. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I almost completely missed the report of the representative of the Agency of Internet advertising ‚ÄúAdwins‚Äù and partially heard the report of Yurasov Denis (who, by the way, is progressing well as a speaker) from ‚ÄúMedvedev Marketing‚Äù. <br><br>  In general, we must pay tribute to the person who composed the program.  The most recent was the presentation of <a href="http://diagrun.livejournal.com/">Dmitry Salko</a> "Principles of the company with an advertising agency.  How to organize the process correctly?  Dima spoke very clearly and in clear business terms about the majority of the rakes that shine to most of those present.  This report, without exaggeration, according to the majority, was the pearl of this conference.  During his speech, Dima showed the main problem areas associated with the web for any company, focused on the risks and how to minimize them.  When the organizers made an attempt to interrupt his report (they say, it was somewhat delayed), the audience almost wanted to give him extra time. <br><br>  This report has shown that now is relevant for many businessmen in Irkutsk, many have outlined Dmitry‚Äôs speech.  There is an opinion that businessmen have already had time to get burned about site building and inefficient investment of money.  People want to know what they did wrong. <br><br>  The event in the conference room ended with a quiz and distribution of elephants.  Later everyone went down to the restaurant, but most people went their ways.  Apparently, they were not aware that it was necessary to go to the conference for the sake of communication and contacts.  Most IT people left to hang out and discuss the conference.  It is a pity that the organizers did not make us a company.  When we left, a lot of food remained in the hall +). <br><br>  The main factors affecting my liver were: <ul><li>  lack of business cards from business representatives; </li><li>  unwillingness to make useful contacts with the conference participants; </li><li>  very different level of speakers; </li><li>  absence of organizers after the conference. </li></ul>  The main conclusion: the business has already been burned and wants to figure out how to develop on the Internet. <br><br>  P.S.  I was also struck by the lack of representatives of one of the largest advertising sites in Irkutsk - the company <a href="http://www.irk.ru/">IRK.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109972/</a></p>
