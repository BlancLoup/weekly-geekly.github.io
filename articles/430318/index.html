      The reports covered a wide range of topics - from the introduction and integration of free software to low-level features of the implementation of system libraries and packages. <br><br>  Alexander Klyga and Vlad Sharpio (Belarus, Minsk) gave reports on data storage systems, Vadim Zhukov (Russia, Moscow) and Alexander Zaitsev (Belarus, Minsk) on modern approaches in developing and debugging C-applications.  Vladislav Zhalnerovich (Belarus, Minsk) read an introductory note about the low-level structure of libraries in the ELF format.  Roman Garanin (Belarus, Brest) spoke about the work of DevOps for QA using the example of a Java Enterprise project.  Alexey Cheusov gave a visually vivid report in which he described his experience in post-processing photographs in Darktable. <br><br>  Alexey Khlebnikov (Norway, Oslo) shared how to optimize the execution of a program for Android applications using the advanced obfuscation method of constants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/px/8u/nb/px8unb9vtdc7-y6qdjzghesi8-0.jpeg"><br><br>  Several reports dealt with the implementation of open source software: Anastasia Markina and Alexander Grishkin (Russia, Moscow) shared their experience of implementing in the VGIK branch, Dmitry Stepanov (Belarus, Minsk) - the experience of transferring the company's infrastructure from Windows to a heterogeneous architecture based on Linux, Andrey Romanyuk (Belarus, Minsk ) told how open source software changes the enterprise sector.  The report by Anton Novik (Belarus, Minsk) was about the development of the architecture of the Game-stream platform based on OpenSource components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eg/oy/qz/egoyqz2pih2okw3bt4gj7gldyri.jpeg"><br><br>  The permanent participant of the conference, Mikhail Shigorin (Russia, Moscow), and this time did not come empty-handed.  He really brought Alt on ‚ÄúElbrus‚Äù, and also spoke about the status of support for Alt Linux distributions on the Elbrus platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pg/3a/a7/pg3aa7omo0wwvwfoufkzpruddwy.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/da/35/aw/da35awie5xgb6skmi8kpueegtpu.jpeg"><br><br>  We had a really luxurious weekend: rest in a wonderful place of ‚ÄúGalaxy‚Äù and informative conversations with developers, testers, directors, business owners, managers, system administrators, devops, investors, designers and other IT specialists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/su/ln/or/sulnor3veeu2tzr8-xr7hs-l4vq.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uf/i-/ea/ufi-ea_rbo1bc1hcsew1c6rkzra.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2f/yw/ar/2fywarl3k5f4i0r2ljswaxkrdzu.jpeg"><br><br>  This year, Viktor Belogolovko (Ukraine, Donetsk) first came to LVEE not only with a guitar.  This time he grabbed the drone, which was taken many pictures from this article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2p/fs/hm/2pfshmwr9keyfuratfhz2shrp7q.jpeg"><br><br>  The engineer who was hunted by the FBI and Interpol, widely known as ‚ÄúHacker from Rechitsa‚Äù, Sergey Yarets came here and told about the ease with which Microsoft, Google and Facebook give out data on people, as well as how to get rid of this data.  (Photo: Alexander Korsak / dev.by) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qv/jx/gk/qvjxgkncyf-oqlz64ucz6znab-i.jpeg"><br><br>  Yes, you heard right.  This year, instead of the usual summer playground near Grodno, LVEE was held for the first time at the Galaktika tourist center near Minsk (familiar to the regular participants of the winter session of the conference - LVEE Winter).  Despite some initial concerns related to the transfer of the usual place, ‚ÄúGalaxy‚Äù has justified itself by easier accessibility for participants from the near and, especially, from far abroad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kv/hr/4m/kvhr4mh2ttoimd0y_1n5qibmzws.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zn/so/0o/znso0o0p2sqp580ozmeai1atu_w.jpeg"><br><br>  For participants, all 4 days of the conference worked mini-bars and a buffet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/j1/ar/dwj1arj1nchvi33v8bxirwvj2-8.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Chips &amp; Bumps </h4><br>  By "the most informal IT conference" really means such. <br><br><ul><li>  The four-day event is always held outside the city, in the forest (in the cones). </li></ul><br><ul><li>  In addition to the scientific part of the conference, participants have a lot of fun, having fun in the evenings.  This is a campfire gathering, guitar songs performed by Olga Kharkevich (Belarus, Gomel), strong drinks from the organizers, delicious kebabs and snacks, billiards, laser tag, a rope town, a mini-zoo ... someone just got acquainted, talked with each other, and someone shared successful IT experience.  In general, the impressions of the conference are only positive - both for the mind and for the soul. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/ja/83/jyja83_fpevdrfvceu8kpcge_f8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eg/o-/d-/ego-d-qra_ohtmlxaxwioqpg9qo.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w_/2q/k3/w_2qk3olsxtyps8-bj2_f1oxwbw.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1b/oh/q8/1bohq8i9ovii3casgum6ymh1cha.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/go/y0/ml/goy0mljevo6filhmp-rg08_pgee.jpeg"><br><br><ul><li> Dmitry Kostiuk (Belarus, Brest) is the same person without whom no conference can do.  He, as a symbol of LVEE, is the leading formal part of the conference.  He is also the chief editor of the collections of the theses ‚ÄúOpen Technologies‚Äù with the assistance of Anastasia Markina (Belarus, Brest). </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dx/jb/ek/dxjbek-hx63j1wlirzl-_z81eek.jpeg"><br><br><ul><li>  In the meantime, a couple of years ago, Dima organized the opportunity to select a menu for a four-day conference.  If you adhere to a certain form of nutrition (for example, vegetarian), this can be indicated when registering on the site. </li></ul><br><h4>  About useful </h4><br>  The reports materials can be found on the <a href="https://lvee.org/">LVEE</a> website <a href="https://lvee.org/">in the Reports section -&gt; 2018 Materials</a> . <br><br>  You can watch and listen to lectures on the website <a href="http://0x1.tv/">of Stas Fomin‚Äôs reports and seminars on IT</a> in the category <a href="http://0x1.tv/Category:LVEE-2018">LVEE-2018</a> or on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DgK3uDUEk_qo%26list%3DPLNcc67qYVXQ0Fog-Q2PgVKWvSgr5WIkcp">YouTube channel</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ct/si/rf/ctsirfqww1-tkb8ugh1kh5dnkf8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jg/dr/dk/jgdrdk1abvbrq2bcqcktqrna8vo.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  What give </h4><br>  LVEE, like any other event, tries to attract attention not only with cool content, but also with unusual merch. <br><br>  For each event a special branded production is made: for T-shirts - green T-shirts, sometimes with individual branding, for speakers and sponsors - the same, but black, for all other participants - white branded T-shirts.  In addition, round magnets with the LVEE logo, pints, circles, collections, and stickers are put into the participants' packages. <br><br>  Traditionally, the collection of theses ‚ÄúOpen Technologies‚Äù is printed in the summer and contains materials from two conferences - winter and summer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vu/kr/zc/vukrzcb5lmjpz8ljn_wprghbmiw.jpeg"><br><br>  The best reports are awarded with a glass statuette, a cup without advertising sponsors and a black mouse pad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fs/ls/gq/fslsgqxr4-ale42kin2t8wjtbbu.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Further sponsors are connected</b> , it is on their stands you can find the most interesting options for souvenirs and promotional materials, which participants gladly take away for memory.  This includes various stickers, notebooks, pens, pins, magnets, soft toys, bandanas, organizers, accessories for smartphones, and more unusual souvenirs, such as a travel pillow, screwdrivers. <br><br>  The LVEE 2018 Summer Conference was made possible thanks to the support of EPAM Systems, Red Hat, Hoster.by, SaM Solutions, Seth &amp; Riley's Garage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jx/uq/uy/jxuquyrww-zgzqkhwpf95znophc.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gb/vj/hj/gbvjhj4dz3n31zigth03ykkqg2w.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sv/uk/v7/svukv7wpydrqemwmtxn4j2ynnau.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h0/3h/ex/h03hexk7ocaj2bqyyvhbhejf0pk.jpeg"><br><br>  Ilya Buzyuk (Moscow, Russia) spoke at the conference from the Red Hat sponsor.  In the cloud computing subsection, Ilya showed how to use Eclipse Che to develop for Kubernetes and OpenShift. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sg/ux/rx/sguxrxooovtox_ggbiemq-c-840.jpeg"><br><br>  On behalf of EPAM Systems, Vitaly Khilko and Dmitry Orekhov (Belarus, Minsk) spoke.  They tried to look into history and highlight the highlights of all the years of linux development.  Also, in the framework of cooperation with EPAM, Alexander Kharkevich (Belarus, Gomel) shared his experience in the development and maintenance of Ansible roles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tc/kh/91/tckh91b9vlc4lpl-z96fqim0s1u.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, I would like to recall LVEE Winter 2018. In addition to the current sponsors, a great contribution was made by the companies Collabora and Profitero.  Employees who do not miss a conference.  For example, Collabora representatives came to the summer conference with reports.  Denis Pynkin (Belarus, Minsk) and Andrei Shadura (Slovakia, Bratislava) talked about various aspects of Apertis, a Debian-derived distribution that they worked on: Denis's report dealt with the use of OSTree for atomic updates, and Andrew spoke about the implementation of automatic testing using LAVA . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ma/v6/yj/mav6yjntrqnersq8vbdgp7hdjgw.png"><br><br>  Yandex lawyer Denis Dorotenko (Moscow, Russia) highlighted a number of legal issues related to software code disclosure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iz/9k/9q/iz9k9ql5gq1t2h6zlwperbnsihm.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  People offscreen </h4><br>  About what is left behind the frame of the conference, usually do not say.  Most of the work on the organization of the conference was laid on the shoulders of Pavel Chebotaryov and Nadezhda Sharpio (Belarus, Minsk).  Let me, on my own behalf and on behalf of all the participants, express gratitude not only to them, but also to all other caring people, who have been helping for the development of the non-commercial conference LVEE for 13 years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vu/pm/8k/vupm8ksncccryzln5wyxrtpxpvu.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúIT Friday‚Äù </h4><br>  This is what a perfect Friday evening looks like!  That's right - when there are unlimited resources in the cloud, and around - people with whom there is something to talk about.  Special thanks to Olga Kuzeeva for organizing an IT Friday within the framework of LVEE - OpenSource.  All pros and cons (virtualization, storage, networking, upgrades). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iy/6x/2t/iy6x2t8__z_j1foqj__efdaqqve.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k4/7t/uf/k47tufb-0i2-x3o2ngad57drula.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ok/vc/0f/okvc0fkihyj1rcqagovxbdruvlg.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hf/ge/o3/hfgeo3glkhyxieeuzqazlzdb_jy.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fe/pd/hp/fepdhp--sojcnypa6e5zfitnaf0.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gu/-o/lw/gu-olw250fh6anhpaf3uycvwuvg.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Experiment </h4><br>  One of the mass events was the workshop of the Gelshalt-psychologist from Brest, Olga Kirichik, ‚ÄúConflict Resolution;  anger management;  personal boundaries ‚Äù, which was attended by about half of the conference participants, which made it possible to verify the relevance of the topic of the seminar.  All participants in the section were tested for self-assessment of conflict, and in the practical part, psychological exercises were conducted on how to get out of conflicts.  At the end of the 2-hour workshop, IT specialists thanked Olga for the relevance of the topic, which deeply touched many participants, helped them to look into themselves, turn to their internal resources, which contributed to the resolution of intrapersonal and interpersonal conflicts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xo/v4/js/xov4jsqt5ccqkfches-tdlplemm.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Who said that Linux is not a cake? </h4><br>  Every year Olga Pynkina (Belarus, Minsk) is pleased with her pastry hobby, which prepares a thematic delicious cake for all participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z3/py/j5/z3pyj5wyd2vcda6n-32bdpzp08c.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Result </h4><br>  Unanimously, Igor Chubin (Germany, Nuremberg) won the prize for the best report - ‚ÄúConsole-oriented services: wttr.in, cheat.sh, rate.sx‚Äù - ‚ÄúIdea, use, creation‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t4/jh/sy/t4jhsybm-ybxbhgdxnoydpuacy0.jpeg"><br><br>  Mikola Marzhan (Ukraine, Kiev) made a vivid report on his struggle to cross Jenkins with AWS instances, who deserved the prize of the organizing committee for the most memorable performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iw/d0/ni/iwd0niiikule6d_htnywing-xmy.jpeg"><br><br>  This is the most informal and sincere IT party in 2018!
