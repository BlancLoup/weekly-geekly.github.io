As promised, we are publishing a second selection of new products and accessories that will make a real high-tech fortress out of your house or apartment. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/276400/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab3/21b/a64/ab321ba647fa5fa4a637c1f115599297.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  XIAOMI Mi Smart Temperature and Humidity Sensor - temperature and humidity sensor </h2><br>  Literally in April, XIAOMI expanded its family of home accessories with a new XIAOMI Mi Temperature temperature and humidity sensor.  This baby determines the temperature with an accuracy of 0.3 ¬∞ C, the error in measuring humidity is 3%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bca/297/71c/bca29771cb93dc819878b46d7ecde964.jpg">

      The device works at temperatures from -20 ¬∞ C to +60 ¬∞ C - we understand that circumstances are different, but it is unlikely that your home will be hotter or colder (unless, of course, you decide to turn everything into a huge freezer).  With a weight of only 15 g, this is one of the most compact and yet multifunctional solutions. <br><br>  XIAOMI Mi Temperature will be an excellent addition to your smart home system: for example, it automatically starts a humidifier if it detects insufficient humidity (too dry air), as well as air conditioning - you yourself set the optimal value. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4dd/0d8/4e2/4dd0d84e27dd84acbc9cd1d2bb31ddbc.jpg"></div><br><br>  The sensor sends all the data on temperature and humidity to the proprietary Mi application, so if it detects a serious deviation from normal values, it will warn the owner using a smartphone.  This will allow you to quickly localize a small fire or flooding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6fd/084/165/6fd0841656ce716e1b8c86f054a9fbc8.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bbf/b82/eeb/bbfb82eebd7daa31c6b1cde8e5494c1f.jpg"><br><br>  If you already have an active smart home system or you just want to create one, XIAOMI Mi Temperature is a real must have.  Compact, versatile and reliable, GearBest <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/living-appliances/pp_344665.html%3F52%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">is</a> also <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/living-appliances/pp_344665.html%3F52%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">available at a discount</a> . <br><br><h2>  XIAOMI Smart Mi Air Purifier - to keep it clean </h2><br>  The second version of the air purifier from XIAOMI with reduced dimensions, which did not affect the quality of air purification.  It looks interesting and presentable, the design is minimalistic, the suction holes are located at the bottom, and the fan is right on the lid.  Dimensions - 520 mm (height) and 240 mm (width), the length of the power cord 1.8 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/456/fa1/b1d/456fa1b1db210d96f6734f78767876be.jpg"><br><br>  Here (on top) you will find a button to turn the cleaner on and off and switch to one of three modes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a01/42e/338/a0142e338c9a2a511d341805ec107850.jpg"><br><br>  The characteristics of the device are impressive - every hour the cleaner conducts up to 330 cubic meters of air through itself, the recommended area for cleaning is from 23 to 39 square meters.  XIAOMI Mi Air Purifier 2 is able to filter up to 99.7% of unhealthy particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers and up to 99.5% of particles with a diameter of 0.3 micrometer.  As for large particles, 100 percent purification is claimed. <br><br>  The cleaner, as we said, works in three modes - automatic, in which Mi Air Purifier 2 analyzes the air itself and decides whether to increase or decrease the fan speed, at night, when the fan is almost silent, and also user-defined, you set the speed for application help. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/718/b0b/c1c/718b0bc1c651c402de7d46f13ad4545f.jpg"><br><br>  The device cleans the air not only from small particles, but also from harmful gases in the room up to 46.6 square meters.  The indicator on the front panel will allow you to understand the condition of the air: green (particle content is normal), yellow (the permissible level is slightly exceeded) and red (critical content of harmful particles).  The cleaner also removes dust, odors after smoking and formaldehyde. <br><br>  Inside, it looks even more interesting - two fans (and not one, as in the previous generation) and the filters themselves - activated carbon, HEPA, PET mesh. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4f/dd9/659/c4fdd9659b07fec1ea282f1e0f7cbd60.jpg"></div><br>  Of the additional features - the timer automatically turn on, turn off the light indicator and sounds, protect against children and, most importantly, update the firmware with one button!  And how it looks in the interior! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6c7/83e/c47/6c783ec47f0ba570c13bf70ff481bf39.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/home-smart-improvements/pp_268522.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">The XIAOMI Mi Air Purifier 2 is</a> already available at GearBest at a very attractive price. <br><br><h2>  XIAOMI Yeelight LED Smart Bulb - there is not a lot of light </h2><br>  LED lamp controlled via Wi-Fi using an application for iPhone and iPad and Android devices.  It does not require installation of any additional equipment - screwed into a cartridge (standard E27 base, used in many floor lamps), launched the application, and everything is ready!  It is possible not only to turn on or off the light, but also to change the brightness of the lighting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fcd/5f8/692/fcd5f869211220254d9785e2d75340ee.jpg"><br><br>  Lamp power is 8 W (very low power consumption), color temperature - 4000K, flux - 600 lumens.  Despite such a small power, it is an excellent substitute not only for energy-saving light bulbs, but also for incandescent bulbs.  Protection against overheating and overloading is foreseen, the lifetime is about 25,000 hours. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mx5eqbUx5L8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  XIAOMI Yeelight LED belongs to the XIAOMI family of smart home devices and is controlled by ... yes, again, Mi Home.  Integration with the smart home also allows you to set up automatic lamp shutdown when you leave home. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3a/20e/15d/f3a20e15de516d13e4ab5124baafccd4.jpg"></div><br>  You can select a preset brightness value (for example, 50%) or customize your own.  Warm light is ideal for reading or relaxing in front of the fireplace on a weekend day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/480/bce/fa1/480bcefa1a81dc6c4f473f708fba335a.jpg"><br><br>  It is noteworthy that you can control the light bulb from the local network or via the Internet.  You can also combine several of these lamps into a single network and manage everything at once using the application, which makes this solution very attractive for small cafes.  About the house and do not say - the thing is simply irreplaceable.  And if you think that you have nothing to surprise you with, look <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-light-bulb/pp_278478.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">at the Yeelight LED page on GearBest</a> . <br><br><h2>  Let's play?  XIAOMI Wi-Fi Tank </h2><br>  Who has not dreamed of owning a tank?  But not online, but the real one, with a big gun and the ability to move along the street.  This XIAOMI tank is a smaller copy (34 cm long) of the American M1A2 Abrams battle tank. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/524/d10/1aa/524d101aa02b53bc12816b00b3993d3c.jpg"></div><br><br>  However, this is not the most important thing.  The main feature of this tank is an HD camera for shooting video: the image is transmitted to the smartphone in real time using two Wi-Fi antennas, which, well, fit the toy design very well.  True, from afar one might think that this is a tank-shaped router.  The control range is very good - up to 30 meters indoors and up to 60 meters outside.  XIAOMI Wi-Fi Tank can overcome small obstacles: it‚Äôs unlikely to climb curbs, so here we will give free rein to your imagination. <br><br>  In general, the toy is quite realistic, there is a built-in speaker that simulates the sounds of shots.  It is controlled by a mobile device, and moves thanks to eight AA batteries.  Especially cool to play at night due to the interesting lighting and realistic sound. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/edf/d62/e18/edfd62e180c9ec0f37195b60850c4c8d.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a80/e9c/17b/a80e9c17b6b8aaa9ef598dbcb8caa5f5.jpg"></div><br><br>  From this, without exaggeration, not only children, but also adults will be delighted - as a gift it is.  In GearBest <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-cctv/pp_239581.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">XIAOMI Wi-Fi Tank is already available</a> , and with the code JRXMT the price will be only $ 89.99. <br><br><h2>  XIAOMI Mi TV Box 3 Enhanced - 4K Set-Top Box </h2><br>  The TV set Mi TV Box 3 Enhanced, XIAOMI, introduced in early March, and the device immediately interested users with its characteristics.  Incredibly compact console (only 100 x 100 x 25 mm) with a weight of 190 g. This does not prevent it from having an HDMI connector and two USB 2.0 ports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b06/869/cfb/b06869cfb0a5f32a2a5ae87f06c09dff.jpg"><br><br>  Under the hood, this baby has a six-core 64-bit SoC MediaTek MT8693 processor (two Cortex-A72 2 GHz and four Cortex-A53 1.6 GHz).  Plus 2 GB of RAM and 8 GB of Flash.  Imagination PowerVR GX6250 is responsible for the graphics.  It does not work on the latest Android (5.1), but with the MIUI shell.  From wireless interfaces - Wi-Fi 802.11ac, which can accelerate to 300 Mb / s, as well as Bluetooth 4.1.  No Ethernet connector, although is it needed so much? <br><br>  An active cooling system is an obvious plus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/45f/2ce/2c1/45f2ce2c1949d4d4c5f7e1a2e54f8ef9.jpg"><br><br>  From the Mi Box 3 console also differs improved performance of the processor and video accelerator.  Another important feature is the ability to view content in 4K H.265 (60 fps) or H.264 (30 fps).  AirPlay and Miracast support has not disappeared anywhere - you can play games on the big screen, and in a flash turn a cozy movie viewing into a full-fledged family movie show. <br><br>  But that's not all - this console also has a remote control with a built-in gyroscope and an accelerometer to use the remote control as a game controller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/715/815/152/715815152e2baa0d33ae757e31e1c8de.jpg"><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b7/2ec/ac9/9b72ecac9c60bec64431dd344263fdf9.jpg"></div><br><br>  This cool multimedia center <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_333724.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">can</a> already <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_333724.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">be bought on GearBest</a> , and we would advise you to hurry. <br><br><h2>  XIAOMI Mi Smart Wi-Fi Multifunction Gateway </h2><br>  Another member of the family of smart home from XIAOMI.  It will become an excellent component of your home security system, which is conveniently monitored using an application on your smartphone (yes, Mi Home).  There is a built-in speaker with support for 1200 radio stations, backlighting with 16 million colors, the ability to set your own call and many other useful features.  Many, however, open only after purchasing a full set of sensors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36f/d59/b77/36fd59b77f05219c4c70945f65beb6d1.jpg"><br><br>  The device works fine in combination with motion sensors, including on windows and doors - for example, you can set up automatic activation of the backlight or sound signal when activity is detected.  If you collect a security system from XIAOMI, it is simply a necessary element of it, and a multifunctional one.  It weighs only 100 g with dimensions of 90 x 90 x 30 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d0a/d75/9db/d0ad759db4a844158596bdf5caec5a0c.jpg"><br><br>  GearBest <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/living-appliances/pp_344667.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">provides not only this device</a> , but also a complete set of sensors for your home.
