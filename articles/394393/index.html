The Webby Awards are deservedly called the Internet Oscar. <br><br>  So what is interesting, according to the Webby Awards, is now on the Internet ...

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d83/975/8d8/d839758d898649af8fbb7d83a35e4079.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Traditionally, the winners are determined in five categories: web sites, video, advertising, mobile applications and social networks. <br><br>  And each of them can be further divided into several categories.  For any direction, two winners are determined, based on the results of online voting by users and the choice of a professional jury. <br><br>  The nomination ‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù contains more than 50 destinations and, accordingly, a good hundred winners.  You can get acquainted with them, see the best projects and find something interesting for yourself on the official <a href="http://webbyawards.com/winners/2016/">website of the</a> event.  And I will tell only about those projects that hit me personally. <br><br><h4>  Rainforest guardians </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/390/f57/197/390f57197f814a8db261ac2b645cea0a.jpg"><br>  This is the rare case when jury and online users come together to choose the winner in the nomination.  The site of the Rainforest guardians is a social project designed to unite people in an attempt to save the flora and fauna of tropical forests, to pay attention to the problems of the inhabitants of small tribes. <br><br>  Bright, dynamic, with a perfectly made bunch of 3D and media - it really attracts attention.  The initial panorama of the rainforest is accompanied by the voice of the announcer and the sounds of nature.  Further action smoothly passes to the three-dimensional map.  It looks like a colorful game.  You can move the map in any direction.  Admire the scenery, clouds and flying birds.  But it is worth choosing one of the zones, and the site will offer a lot of information in the form of three-dimensional panoramas, interesting video episodes, photos. <br><br>  <a href="http://rainforest.arkivert.no/">Rainforest guardians</a> is a great example of symbiosis of three-dimensional graphics and video material. <br><br><h4>  Inside abbey road </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a65/cc0/5a3/a65cc05a3bd94962bfb064da3cc27934.jpg"><br>  Abbey Road Studios is a legendary recording studio in London, and the project <a href="https://insideabbeyroad.withgoogle.com/en/welcome">Inside Abbey Road</a> offers a real-time walk along its back streets, corridors and even look over the shoulder of the editor during recording. <br><br>  This unique project appeared thanks to Google.  Dozens of interactive panoramas, thought-out transition system allows you to literally travel through the studio rooms.  Interestingly, some panoramas have video inserts.  For example, you quietly move around the sound studio, and at this time the engineer continues to work.  At such moments it seems that you are truly present there. <br><br>  If you are tired of walking along the corridors, you can try to create your sound mix using a special application that also opens in the browser. <br><br><h4>  Falter's inferno </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fe/8d0/bc2/2fe8d0bc2ce240fe8c21b3d326c64f2a.jpg"><br>  The terrible thing is hell from Falter ... Falter is an Austrian newspaper, and the presentation itself is a kind of commercial, but how it is done! <br><br>  Black and white tones are configured in a pessimistic way.  Continuous vertical animation allows you to descend deeper and deeper into purgatory.  Animated pictures and heavy music finally painted in gloomy tones the action taking place.  And if it is not clear to anyone that the authors of the presentation themselves want to convey to the viewer, then you can read a brief description for each circle of hell.  But in the end, of course, happy end. <br>  <a href="http://falter.madebywild.com/">Falter's inferno</a> worth seeing.  The work of artists and animators is impressive! <br><br><h4>  Google frightgeist </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29e/5c8/cb5/29e5c8cb540e47dcb8f3ccda3d4f0123.jpg"><br>  I am far from thinking about Halloween as a holiday for Russia.  Not the culture, not the customs, but I could not pass by such a medalist. <br><br>  So, another brainchild from Google - <a href="https://frightgeist.withgoogle.com/">Google Frightgeist</a> site, winner of the nomination ‚ÄúBest Design.  Functionality".  The main purpose of it - to help choose the most current costume for Halloween.  However, the topic is not important, the main thing is how everything is implemented! <br><br>  A map of the mainland with floating islets of "trends".  Everything moves, everything "breathes" life.  Something, in part, resembles the Brownian movement of molecules ... Each "molecule" is the most popular theme of the costume in the chosen city.  Clicking on it will take you to another page where various graphs are shown. <br><br>  The verdict is - this is a toy ... but beautiful. <br><br><h4>  Experience Curiosity </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c6/514/be5/9c6514be5ffb40c0a8423c1577513bc9.jpg"><br>  This is a completely different approach.  The NASA <a href="http://eyes.nasa.gov/curiosity/">Experience Curiosity</a> presentation won the nomination "Government and Civil Innovations."  Virtual rover allows you to ride on the surface of Mars.  But do not think that this is a simple game! <br><br>  NASA employees approached this case responsibly and introduced a lot of interesting possibilities to the application, from studying the device to viewing real photos of the planet. <br><br>  The virtual mars rover repeats the real fellow.  You can study its individual parts, read descriptions of them, and even try it in action.  Rover is able to move along the paths that the real Curiosity has gone through, and all this is accompanied by video viewing and photo shoots. <br><br>  It is especially pleasant that our domestic developers have put their hands to this triumph.  The presentation of Experience Curiosity was made on the basis of the Blend4Web framework, which is designed for WebGL browser applications. <br><br>  Unfortunately, this is the only achievement from Russian developers that "lit up" at such a major event.  Although, maybe I was looking bad ... <br><br><h4>  Way to go </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d33/9ae/fcc/d339aefccbc94782ab8e8add7ea6e080.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://a-way-to-go.com/">Way to Go</a> is the winner of the ‚ÄúNetArt‚Äù nomination.  Approved by mutual decision of both parties: the jury and users.  Strange site of an incomprehensible destination.  You run a little man through a real forest along an equally real path.  Just move and admire the panorama.  You can rotate the camera, you can jump and stop. <br><br>  I thought for a long time about the practical meaning of this demonstration.  Everything ran and ran, in the hope that something would happen.  As a result, I decided to carefully read the message from the creators on the main page, and immediately everything became clear.  When you also think about the meaning of this presentation - remember my advice and return to the main page. <br><br><h4>  Mighty nice </h4> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f67/811/e6d/f67811e6d99c4c17b9fcf4d4b2e7fc7d.jpg"><br>  The winner of the nomination "Portfolio", approved by online voting users.  <a href="http://mightynice.com.au/">Mighty Nice</a> is an animation studio based in Australia. <br><br>  The first impression of this site is attachment.  I don't want to leave at all.  Bright, colorful animations, thoughtful design, concise and useful information.  The guys seriously approached the issue of placing their portfolio and managed to profitably present it. <br><br>  Very interesting and unusual site from a design point of view. <br><br>  Of course, this is a small part of the winners of the Webby Award 2016. And this is my purely subjective choice.  But, really, websites every year are becoming more dynamic, brighter and more interesting! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394393/</a></p>
