The time spent in the first network was limited by the time and the purse of the parents, receiving information from this network was painfully long and not justifying itself, it was much easier to look into the encyclopedia and get what is really necessary.  With the second network, everything was much simpler, but the feeling of being outside the network created some discomfort.  Auxiliary software (hereinafter simply referred to as software) was distributed on compact discs, and this was sometimes a faster way to get information, and cheaper compared to the Internet. <br><br>  The Internet for my ancestors was something negative - a place where nothing but porn and viruses exist anymore.  And this is the kind of thing that makes the home phone constantly busy, yes, and I used it when the class teacher had to call, who scored trying to call and asked me for the parents to contact her.

      The search for the necessary information was limited to the local catalog of Internet resources and the famous Yandex. <br>  Before reaching adulthood, I managed to get into the storehouse of information, no, it was not a library, it was a salon of compact discs.  And later I got a job with the provider, where I was not limited to accessing the Internet, either at work or at home.  Then I began to receive new software distributions and new knowledge. <br><br>  My parents put up with the times, my specialization was not at all computer, and the computer was needed to write a scientific work in the botanical field.  By the will of fate, everything changed dramatically and I began to work and improve myself in the IT sphere.  By this time, the Internet for me has become more accessible and much faster, by the same later, the age of majority has come and my opportunities have become much wider. <br>  Active use of the search engine, ICQ and chat rooms have become a daily, commonplace.  Daaaaa, I remember the time of the local chat and the desire of many around me to open my local chat in order to gain maximum power.  At that time there was no such thing as personal data and everyone willingly shared it right and left.  So knowing ICQ chaters could find out his name, surname, age and even ip, the latter allowed not having admin rights and using the vulnerabilities of the systems of that time not to deny access not only to chat, but also the entire Internet.  But this is not about how we used, use and will use the global network, but about how it uses us ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How we all tricked </h4><br><br>  First, fidonet - then the Internet, first blue hyperlinks - and then masterpieces of design.  That's how it developed and partly before my eyes. <br>  The search engine developers tried to optimize their systems in such a way as not to miss a single website that appeared on the global network, sometimes wondering how my mini-website even got into Yandex.  But with the advent of high-speed Internet, the opportunity to make more and more massive sites appeared, I remember at first there were such non-public rules for a successful site, for limiting the page size (so that it all loaded quickly and the user got access to the page), now these rules spit, because the speed of the Internet allows. <br><br>  However, the search engine has changed a lot, now not search engines adapt to sites, but sites to search engines.  Search engine developers are trying to simplify the search for the right things and understand the user. <br>  And developers and site owners want to get on the pedestal (place of honor) in the search.  And after all, everyone participates in the improvement of this mechanism, we train these hefty machines that today are able to answer any question that interests us, monitor our activity on the Internet and offer what they think we need. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTomorrow,‚Äù these machines begin to talk to us in a voice, and every hour / day their knowledge increases at the expense of us humans, they grow as a separate organism that we can control for now.  Isn't the search engine an AI (artificial intelligence)? <br><br>  ‚ÄúAfter-Tomorrow‚Äù we will store all the data online and use the power of big intelligent machines for our calculations.  We attach the hands of these machines and they will not be a virtual me or you, but something that has its own logic, thinking and actions peculiar to people (maybe even feelings). <br><br>  What are we today?  On the shelves, less and less often you come across someone‚Äôs real books, you don‚Äôt need to chase after knowledge, you can always open Wikipedia or Wikiquote and paste it on your wall on VKontakte or Facebook and pass it off as your thoughts or knowledge. <br>  In the present, no matter how much you know, it is important whether you know how to use the information that is presented on the world wide web.  The ability to use and find is put above the knowledge itself. <br>  Universities do not keep up with the flow of new information and the knowledge gained is not relevant and not applicable in most cases! <br><br>  To deprive us of this unlimited flow of knowledge and we will remain helpless, blind kittens.  War of devices is possible! <br>  Imagine that most devices will become your enemies, they can harm us. A mobile phone, a communicator, a computer, a laptop have long become the second memory for many of us, to deprive us of it is all the same as forgetting some important part of our life.  And with each new generation of cars and people, the line between them shrinks. <br><br><h4>  We are committed to the plot of the film The Matrix. </h4><br><br>  10 years ago, we could not even imagine that a personal computer could fit in a pocket.  Today, modern communicators and tablets are catching up with their older counterparts (PCs, laptops).  And it seems that quite a bit remains: to invent a compact energy source of greater capacity and apart from the communicator no things are needed. <br>  At home you have a smart TV, to which you can already connect your device and work on the big screen.  As a manipulator, the same communicator or your voice and gestures in the air. <br><br>  It is very convenient to track any everyday needs of a mere mortal and with the help of this knowledge to manipulate them at all levels. <br>  Let's go a little ahead.  Google glass goes on sale, now the video recorder is not only in cars, but also in humans.  A device that not only knows the location, but also sees what is happening around.  In addition, valuable tips will be able to push the user to the institution for premises, etc.  as does Google now. <br><br>  The next step is compactness and alternative energy sources for devices.  More recently, Samsung has announced the development of contact lenses with a screen.  Those.  information will be displayed to your eyes, and as I understand it, both the processor and the other components are also on this lens.  Did you hear about augmented reality?  Imagine that you are looking at the world through glass, in which there are clues to things in the real world.  Here is Gloria jeans, but today you have not eaten and there is fast food nearby.  A certain terminator interface. <br>  161918.21086_realSo, an alternative energy source can be a person himself.  First, we voluntarily implant GPS, 3g, Wi-Fi and lenses, and then, in general, identification occurs everywhere on these devices.  Hospitals, restaurants, shops accept payment and carry out identification only through these interfaces. <br><br>  For especially lazy auto mode, you don‚Äôt have to decide anything yourself, the car will decide everything for you.  He will find and arrange you a job, order food that your body perceives ... What is not the option of enslaving a person? <br>  And imagine that through these lenses can be displayed, then what really is not - people, cars and entire cities.  This is similar to the matrix already. <br>  We connect sensors to our body to get additional sensations and opportunities, and the machine with AI uses us each as a big battery.  After all, for the existence of the entire machine, only one thing is needed - energy, and a person is suitable for this like no other. <br><br>  Today we produce them, tomorrow they will start producing us, and here we will already change roles - not we them, but they will have us. <br>  They are not a gadget for us, but we are for them. The machines will be interested in developing more capacitive batteries with minimal production and maintenance costs ... <br><br><h4>  Between present and future </h4><br><br>  Gamers no longer go to the store for a CD, there is Steam and Origin, having a plastic bank card, pay for the game via the Internet and it is available to us anywhere and at any time, the main password from the account is not forgotten. <br>  We are taught, taught to buy digital content - AppStore, Play-market and similar projects.  Take a look at your communicator, most programs are designed in a form that resembles physically real things. <br><br>  Imagine that a person has a physical shell, but does not use it, what does it give us?  The minimum cost of producing things - all items are digital and in reality do not exist. <br><br>  For example, you wanted to change the wallpaper in the apartment in which you allegedly live, like the game Sims you give the command to launch a store, in front of you there are thousands, millions of interior options that can be purchased.  Today your apartment is decorated for a party with a large plasma on the wall, and tomorrow a picture of a famous artist hangs at the same place.  At one point, you can completely change not only the world around you, but also the presentation of yourself to others.  You no longer need exhausting workouts to maintain your figure, you are only a part of the program for others, the wallet allows - change your appearance at least every day.  Be a man, a woman;  fat or thin ... <br><br>  Digital content is more profitable than real production, everything is limited by our imagination, programmers and designers of the future world.  It makes no sense to spend money on production and study, why?  We can create our own world, with our own rules and laws.  A resource in this world, not precious metals, oil and gas, but man himself. <br>  To maintain the work of the entire system and infrastructure of the ‚Äúnew world‚Äù, resources are needed, a person has consumed everything he could, the planet is unable to give something, but man has it himself. <br><br>  In the real world there is no point - limited space, long development of technology, the possibility of causing physical damage to each of us (violence), demographic growth and decline.  In the digital world - space is unlimited, technology = fantasy, violence is absent as a factor. <br><br>  Physical sensations are created for each of us by a kind of machine, which, in part, does not allow beyond the limits of the digital world.  You can‚Äôt get out of a certain network, and there‚Äôs no need, the reality is more depressing.  The machine is so perfect that it can make us feel at the right moment, there is a desire to multiply, not necessarily to have a child, a digital model that becomes available and grows in a family, and the family itself may not even be aware of its reality.  This is the next step, to transfer us to the digital world and study our life already from the inside, improving the system itself. <br><br>  PS: I did not know which section to add, and karma is not up to par, so I added where I could. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198206/</a></p>
