Technologies that have existed on the web for many years are still actively developing and improving in the mobile market. <br><br>  Recently, there have been many tools for publishers and advertisers that allow you to effectively manage a variety of targeting parameters for advertising campaigns, which is often the key factor guaranteeing the expected result.  But for the sites, everything is still very sad. <br><br>  In May 2014, we began searching for a platform that would allow us to increase advertising revenue in our applications and solve the following problems. 
      <br>

      <br>
    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Geography</b> <br><br>  <u>Problem</u> : Some ad networks specialize in the Russian market, others in the US, and others in Asia. <br><br>  <u>Solution</u> : Before placing ads in your application, you need to analyze which regions your users are located in, select the strongest advertising networks for these regions and show ads from the networks of the respective regions. <br><br>  <b>Occupancy</b> <br><br>  <u>Problem</u> : Many ad networks are unable to provide a high fill rate.  As a result, some of the hits are simply lost.  And with them, and reduced income. <br><br>  <u>Solution</u> : Always use multiple ad networks.  If one of them cannot find an advertiser for one of the impressions, send a request to the next one.  And so on, until we get the cherished advertiser.  In this way, you can show ads to each of your users and thereby increase revenue. <br><br>  <b>Incorrect advertisers</b> <br><br>  <u>Problem</u> : The advertising network is interested in increasing its income, and not in increasing the revenue of sites.  Thus, the sites are not those advertisers who are best converted, and those who have signed a contract with the advertising network. <br><br>  In one of the popular networks, for example, the following mechanism is used: the higher the cost of installation is indicated by the advertiser, the more often its advertisement will be shown.  At the same time, it does not take into account how much time the advertising campaign has been launched, what quality banners and in general the advertiser‚Äôs overall conversion into installations.  It is often possible to observe how the site unscrewed 10 thousand impressions and at the same time did not receive a single cent of payment, since  There was no conversion. <br><br>  <u>Solution</u> : Regularly upload reports from the used advertising networks, with details by advertisers.  Those advertisers who have not paid a single cent for 1000 impressions, feel free to send to the black list. <br><br>  It is important to remember that what is not converted on one site can very well convert to another.  For example, an advertisement for the ‚ÄúAlarm Clock‚Äù application can be perfectly converted from the ‚ÄúWeather‚Äù application and not converted at all from a child's play. <br><br>  Therefore, for each site, you need to create and update a separate list of ‚Äúwrong‚Äù advertisers. <br><br>  <b>RTB Exchange</b> <br><br>  <u>Problem</u> : RTB exchanges are a great way to increase revenue from their applications.  Their beauty lies in the fact that they have a huge amount of information about each user, and advertisers are willing to pay much more for a user about whom something is known. <br><br>  Unfortunately, there are a number of problems, because of which an ordinary developer to connect to the stock exchange is very problematic: <br>  exchanges prefer to work only with large sites; <br><ul><li>  connection to the RTB exchange takes an average of 2 months.  In the process of connection, you need to call up several times with different representatives of the exchange, tell what applications you have, sign contracts, NDA.  In general, not the most pleasant process; </li><li>  As a rule, RTB Exchange pays money with a delay of 60 days after the calendar month (net 60).  That is, in reality, you can wait up to three months to get the first payment; </li><li>  Not very stable SDK and weak support for frameworks.  Developing a game on Marmalade?  Get ready to write your own plugin; </li><li>  low occupancy rate  In general, 20-30% occupancy rate on the RTB exchange is an excellent result; </li><li>  problematic user interfaces. </li></ul><br>  <u>Solution</u> : if you have enough traffic (from 3 million full-screen impressions per day or more), you can try to go through the integration process with the exchange yourself.  If you are a small developer, try to find among your friends those who are already working with exchanges directly and agree on the use of their account. <br><br>  As one of the quick solutions, you can try working with RTB MoPub or Smaato.  The process of connecting to them looks quite simple and, after properly configured, they can significantly increase revenue from your sites. <br><br>  <b>User behavior</b> <br><br>  <u>Problem</u> : some users click on everything but never install anything.  Others set everything that they do not offer.  Still others never click on ads and always close them as quickly as possible. <br><br>  <u>Solution</u> : collect statistics for each user.  If you see that the user often installs the advertised applications, show him the CPI of the campaign.  If it frequently clicks, but does not install anything - the CPC of the campaign.  And if at all is very passive - CPM / CPV campaign with pay-per-impression. <br><br>  <b>Abundance of new networks</b> <br><br>  <u>Problem</u> : Once an application begins to collect traffic and occupy a prominent position in the ratings, a lot of offers from advertising networks immediately begin to arrive.  And each promises better conditions than the previous one.  And I would like to try them all and compare them with each other, but I simply do not have enough physical resources. <br><br>  <u>Solution</u> : find an authoritative source that deals with the objective comparison and testing of new networks.  Sometimes new networks can produce a higher income by using new ad formats. <br><br>  <b>How do they all</b> <br><br>  A survey of nearly hundreds of major developers who use advertising to monetize their applications has shown that most of them are developing mediators for themselves that can solve most of the problems listed and significantly increase revenue. <br><br>  The standard scheme is as follows.  The developer selects ad networks with which he wants to work, and then for each country generates a list of networks, sorted in order of priority.  Then it goes, for example, to MoPub and builds a so-called ‚Äúwaterfall‚Äù (waterfall) of the networks for each country and for each application.  A waterfall is simply a list of networks sorted by priority, each of which is polled sequentially until one of the networks gives an answer. <br><br>  Then the task of the traffic manager is to keep this waterfall up to date, block ‚Äúwrong‚Äù advertisers in each network and periodically connect new networks. <br><br>  Sometimes such dialogues are obtained: <br><br><blockquote>  Denis: this is what we talked about yesterday <br>  Denis: I actually wrote about it from the mopab <br>  Denis: quote <br>  Denis: Also, for all of your apps are all the same across all of your apps.  We would recommend eCPMs for each app.  Have you had a chance to update these lately? <br>  Denis: what the hell do I need this gemor?  for each app, for each ad unit, display your eCPM?!? <br>  Pavel Golubev: yes, to the point straight <br>  Denis: bullshit <br>  Denis: I understand that it will give even greater gain in rhubarb <br>  Denis: however, to refresh all this you need to spend the day <br>  Denis: and if appov, like you, 200 <br>  Denis: then this is a whole department </blockquote><br><br>  Denis, by the way, sells 140 million impressions per day in his mobile apps. <br><br>  <b>How to</b> <br><br>  We believe that developers should be engaged in the creation of unique and exciting applications.  And the optimization of advertising - someone else.  Well, for example, we. <br><br>  Therefore, from the very beginning of work on <a href="http://appodeal.com/">Appodeal,</a> we kept two points in mind: <br><ul><li>  The head of the developer should not be sick </li><li>  Developer revenue should increase </li></ul><br><br>  First of all, I must say that we have already managed to solve all the above problems: <br><ul><li> We will create accounts for you in all networks for yourself, register the necessary settings and details for payments. </li><li>  No need to integrate each network separately.  All in one single SDK. </li><li>  Appodeal automatically receives reports from ad networks, analyzes them by country, application, advertiser, and dynamically builds a sorted list of ad networks for each ad request based on the expected eCPM.  And then the application polls the network one by one until it receives a response.  This not only allows you to always access the network with the highest eCPM, but also to solve the problem of low occupancy rates. </li><li>  For each application within each network, an additional waterfall is created from several units with different minimum eCPMs. </li><li>  In the networks that allow it, we automatically analyze advertisers and add them to the black lists as necessary. </li><li>  You immediately get access to the largest RTB exchanges (Rubicon project, OpenX, Nexage, MoPub, Smaato and others), which allows you to show ads with pay for impressions. </li><li>  We monitor the behavior of our users and can dynamically determine which type of advertising is more suitable for the user - CPI, CPC or CPM. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251997/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251997/</a></p>
