I just want to visit it and that's it, but I can't do it.  In this case, photos that at least partially come to the rescue, but allow you to ‚Äúvisit‚Äù a new place.  Well, or just help to understand whether to go there or not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/97e/ca6/2e5/97eca62e55f42ca638ce324162d27c84.jpg"><br><br>  In short.

Photos</a> <br><br>  Not just one of the first museums that I visited - it was one of the oldest scientific and technical museums in the world, was founded in 1872. <br><br>  Human society is impossible without the exchange of information, the main role in such an exchange is played by communication - the transmission and reception of information through various technical means.  Modern communication unites such independent types of communication as postal, telegraph, telephone, radio, television, space communications, data transmission, primarily computer, information technologies.  The history of the development of technical means and the organization of all branches of communication from the time of their appearance to the present day is presented in the central museum of communications named after AS  Popov.  In this area, the museum is a leading research and cultural and educational institution of our country.  The museum is relatively recently renovated - now it is dry and comfortable there. <br><br>  The official website of the museum mentions about 7 million items.  A detailed study of this number reveals that 6,700,00 units fall only on the state collection of postage (stamps, one of the largest collections in the world), another 60,000 - a documentary fund, 50,000 - a scientific and technical library ... and "only" 20 000 units - various equipment.  Nevertheless, no matter how ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù the number of exhibits is, there is something to look at - a lot of halls, a large number of interactive exhibits.  By the way, the biggest exhibit, perhaps, is a real geostationary artificial satellite of the Earth "Luch-15". <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/s3twriter/album/212725/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a99/247/000/a99247000c5df1af8522a474dcce4c89.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Despite the rather clumsy <a href="http://www.rustelecom-museum.ru/">official website</a> , there is a lot of useful information on it, including a panorama of exhibition halls. <br><br>  I do not exclude that in St. Petersburg there is still something interesting on this topic. <br><br>  <b>My humble opinion: I</b> highly recommend to visit. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#009c46">Ufa</font> </h2><br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/7fd/66e/9de7fd66eff8336ecb40e44a555f6cde.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/7fd/66e/9de7fd66eff8336ecb40e44a555f6cde.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/7fd/66e/9de7fd66eff8336ecb40e44a555f6cde.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/9c8/a5b/f349c8a5b0f36160ce64cb2ba58b6902.gif" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/9c8/a5b/f349c8a5b0f36160ce64cb2ba58b6902.gif" alt="image">  Mail museum </h2><br>  <b>Address:</b> 450000, Ufa, ul.

It is located on the top floor of an office building, it is necessary to pass through the security post - from this, for some reason, I find the conclusion that not many people go to the museum.  Even though his visit (and photography inside) is free. <br><br>  Inside, this is where communication began, how it evolved, and what devices our great-grandfathers used to communicate at a distance.  The undoubted pride of the museum is the Morse and Bodo telegraphs, and the Ericsson telephone set released in 1895. <br><br>  In the same way, many items can be touched, and some of the exhibits are working altogether - they managed to print on some telegraphic installations, to switch switches over. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/s3twriter/album/212727/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/df1/e2b/979/df1e2b979cac9a2bdcce70845abfcdc4.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>My humble opinion:</b> if you are from Ufa, then you can look at your leisure, in other cases it makes no sense to go purposefully. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#009c46">Kazan</font> </h2><br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/7fd/66e/9de7fd66eff8336ecb40e44a555f6cde.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/7fd/66e/9de7fd66eff8336ecb40e44a555f6cde.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/7fd/66e/9de7fd66eff8336ecb40e44a555f6cde.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/7fd/66e/9de7fd66eff8336ecb40e44a555f6cde.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/9c8/a5b/f349c8a5b0f36160ce64cb2ba58b6902.gif" alt="image">  Museum of the History of Communications of the Republic of Tatarstan </h2><br>  <b>Area:</b> about 250 square meters <br>  <b>Number of exhibits:</b> about 5000 <br>  <b>Address:</b> 420095, Republic of Tatarstan, Kazan, ul.

A.S. Popova </h2><br>  At Ekaterinburg, st.  Rosa Luxemburg, 9/11 there is another museum of communications named after A. Popov - although a little less than in St. Petersburg;  it was founded in 1986 by the great-niece of Popov and the head of the Sverdlovsk radio club.  The museum was closed until mid-September, but I called and asked for a visit - they allowed me to wander around and take pictures for free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a40/b98/b74/a40b98b74e7b7bdf6ca1153ae2a38588.png">  <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/s3twriter/album/212722/">Photos of the museum on Yandex.

The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the museum belonged to S. P. Korolev himself, the opening ceremony was solemnly held on April 10, 1981, on the 20th anniversary of the flight into space by Yu. A. Gagarin. <br><br>  The museum is located (made in miniature) Flight Control Center, where you can observe the International Space Station in real time and carry out negotiations with the crew.  Interactive cabin "Buran" with mobility system and panoramic stereo image.  Interactive cognitive and teaching class, made in the form of cabins.  Interactive exhibits are placed in special zones, which include simulators identical to simulators in the Yury Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center: simulator of the rendezvous and docking transport spacecraft, virtual simulator of the international space station, simulator of a search helicopter pilot.  And, of course, where without any film and photographic materials, archival documents, personal belongings of the aerospace industry, items of numismatics, philately, philocarty and phaleristics, works of fine and decorative arts ...?  ) <br><br>  In general, if you at least occasionally dream of moon rovers / rockets / satellites or Belka and Strelka, then you should definitely visit this museum!  By the way, the museum is only after reconstruction - the area has grown to 8500 square meters - if you read all the exhibits thoughtfully (and not just watch), then you can spend more than one day. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/s3twriter/album/212721/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/8cb/039/b61/8cb039b612947c9ae723fd585d7fb6e1.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>My humble opinion: I</b> highly recommend for repeated visits. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/7fd/66e/9de7fd66eff8336ecb40e44a555f6cde.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/7fd/66e/9de7fd66eff8336ecb40e44a555f6cde.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/7fd/66e/9de7fd66eff8336ecb40e44a555f6cde.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/7fd/66e/9de7fd66eff8336ecb40e44a555f6cde.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/7fd/66e/9de7fd66eff8336ecb40e44a555f6cde.png" alt="image">  Moscow Polytechnic Museum </h2><br>  <b>Official website:</b> <a href="http://www.polymus.ru/">www.polymus.ru</a> <br>  <b>Museum area:</b> about 10,500 meters <br>  <b>Address:</b> 3/4, Novaya Ploshchad, Moscow, 101000 (Metro Lubyanka or China City) <br>  <b>Adult ticket price:</b> from 150 rubles <br><br>  The long-lived museum - its history begins as early as 1872, when the first exposition was based on the exhibits of the polytechnic exhibition dedicated to the 200th anniversary of the birth of Peter I.

I was there for the last time in 2011 at a lecture about robotics, and at the same time I took pictures of the computer room - I <s>didn‚Äôt know where to put them for a long time, but now the high point came</s> - sorry, but photos are bye-bye :( <br><br>  <b>My humble opinion: I</b> highly recommend for repeated visits. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/9c8/a5b/f349c8a5b0f36160ce64cb2ba58b6902.gif" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/9c8/a5b/f349c8a5b0f36160ce64cb2ba58b6902.gif" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/9c8/a5b/f349c8a5b0f36160ce64cb2ba58b6902.gif" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/9c8/a5b/f349c8a5b0f36160ce64cb2ba58b6902.gif" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/9c8/a5b/f349c8a5b0f36160ce64cb2ba58b6902.gif" alt="image">  Museum at the Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia </h2><br>  Quite a large (1300 m2) space museum in the city of Korolev.  If you believe the description, then in the demonstration hall shows the history of the creation of domestic rocket and space technology: from the first domestic long-range ballistic missiles to the Energia launch vehicle and the Sea Launch rocket and space complex, from the first artificial satellites to the manned and transport space ships of all modifications. <br><br>  But ... I never managed to visit this museum :) I really wanted to go there, but decided not to go after the first bell: <br><br>  <b>My humble opinion:</b> we are not welcome there) <br><br>  <i>- We have only a group visit, a group of 20 people, the cost of a visit per person is 200 rubles</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Can I visit individually, without a guide?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- In this case, you have to pay for "the whole group", that is, 4,000 rubles.</i> <br><br>  Moreover, they told me that if I wanted to take some pictures or use their materials to write an article, then I should coordinate with their press office.  In general, he rolled his lips to this museum and went to another. <br><br><h2></h2><h2>  <font color="#009c46">Kaluga</font> </h2><br><br>  They say that in Kaluga there is an interesting State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics named after K.E. Tsiolkovsky (IPCC), but I have not yet managed to get to it (as at the beginning of the article, I would like, but still nothing).  But this is the first in the world and the largest space-related museum in Russia, created with the direct participation of S. P. Korolev and Yu. A. Gagarin.  The Cosmonautics Museum was opened in 1967.  Huge area, more than 70,000 exhibits. <br><br>  In addition to the museum, there are separately located the house-museum and the museum-apartment of K.E. Tsiolkovsky, the house-museum of A.L. Chizhevsky and the Planetarium. <br><br>  <b>Official website:</b> <a href="http://www.gmik.ru/">www.gmik.ru</a> <br>  <b>Address:</b> Russia, Kaluga, ul.

I will definitely return at least to the largest ones ‚Äî either alone (in order to read and see more thoughtfully), or with children.
