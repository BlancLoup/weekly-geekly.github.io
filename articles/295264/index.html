To do this, we have to tell about us, which is logical, but when I remember that an article in key media costs from 250,000 rubles, and that Forbes has passed by, I immediately begin to think how to promote the project with ‚Äúlittle blood‚Äù.  Today's post is about two very effective bootstrap stories that will help draw potential users to you, give additional value to your customers, make the market think about your offer, if you are involved in B2B projects and ideas are not mine, forgive me, their authors . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bc/0f9/107/9bc0f91078f04396890fca08165c3f38.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Hive rippers</b>

      I describe the case not because I do it, but solely because it is a great idea from <a href="https://www.amocrm.ru/">AmoCRM</a> colleagues that will be interesting to the reader.  What did the colleagues do?  They just took the phone in their hands and conducted a study of the customer focus of the TOP companies of various industry segments and created an excellent infographic on the basis of results, which plunged business owners into shock.  With their product (CRM system) - it‚Äôs getting into 10 and to me personally, from an outside observer, it seems that they got into the soul of every TOP segment and forced him to ask himself the question - ‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù.  Excellent work on the background of the fact that the guys immediately offer TOP solutions to potential and possibly existing problems.  Aerobatics, I think.  Although, I was ‚Äúoutraged and denied‚Äù at the site of the owners of the surveyed companies, and there are risks in playing games - in most cases, this external PR does not work in favor of the respondents and is negative for them.  As if the enemies do not make the opposite effect. <br><br>  The guys checked the quality of work of fitness centers, hosting providers - this is from what was remembered.  You can repeat the activity for the price of zero, but it will not be so interesting anymore - this is exactly the story, the remake of which will be so loud, you need unexplored segments and the original product, at least.  <a href="https://www.amocrm.ru/blog/32/9001173/">One of the studies</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b53/424/10b/b5342410b4d64d1cbd65bc8b782c5739.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Clubs for users</b> <br><br>  Another reason to talk about your project is the <a href="https://dentalcloud.pro/club">Users Club</a> .  Banks around clients' accounts and bank services began to apply this practice widely.  The first were Sberbank with its project <a href="http://main.dasreda.ru/">Business Environment</a> .  Alpha has the same activity. <br>  The essence of the activity is to aggregate additional offers with a discount around the key product value.  The key word is around the value, which is actually the automation tool in our case.  Around Dental Cloud, we collected logical suggestions from suppliers of equipment, materials, tools, consulting, PR services, and colleagues from <a href="http://medicalapps.ru/">Medicalapps</a> , which perfectly complement our solution. <br><br>  If you talk about how the club affects the promotion, then everything is relatively simple: <br><ul><li>  you are noticed by other players in the market segments and this is not about direct competitors </li><li>  you will find partners for related offers in the segment </li><li>  obviously, you overtake competitors in positioning - you have a product + </li><li>  and it's just a good news story - everyone is tired of reading about your regular releases. </li></ul><br>  Creating a club will not cost you anything and it works according to our experience at <a href="https://dentalcloud.pro/">Dental Cloud.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dae/0e3/8c4/dae0e38c465f412cb694df9f9e3e9ae7.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/dentalcloud/blog/19122/">Previous materials of the author</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295264/</a></p>
