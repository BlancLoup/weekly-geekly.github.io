It is so much time, in all his life, that a person spends waiting for a green traffic light signal.  It is terrible to think how much time goes into the void to wait in the queue.  To help people spend time on things that interest them, we launched <a href="http://picktime.ru/">PickTime</a> . <br>  <a href="http://picktime.ru/">PickTime</a> is a free electronic queue service.  What is an electronic queue, we think, is each.  One way or another, many have come across this concept in everyday life, as many businesses seek to make their lives easier. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Our service, as we would like to think, is more versatile.  The logic of his work is very simple:

      <b>On the one hand, for companies:</b> <br>  There is a business owner, and it doesn't matter if he has a big company or a modest office on the outskirts, a network or one point, the main thing is that he has clients.  Many clients.  And each of them relies on timely, fast and high-quality service. <br>  It is very easy to lose a client due to inattention at the peak of seasonal demand, during holidays or holidays, when there are not enough hands, but it is not so easy to return. <br>  A modern client is demanding and wants to have a guarantee that they will find time and resources.  We offer every business to provide this guarantee to our customers easily and at no cost.  To do this, it is enough to register your company on PickTime 1 time and notify your regular customers about the appearance of an electronic queue.  Those who booked in advance, to serve in a specific period.  Well, then what?  And then the business gets: <br>  - placement on the site at <a href="http://picktime.ru/">PickTime</a> , which means a potential influx of new customers <br>  - free electronic queue for its customers <br>  - reduction of costs for taking orders, recording by phone <br>  - thanks to customers satisfied with the quality of service <br>  - reputation of a progressive company, striving to be in trend <br><br>  <b>On the other hand - for people:</b> <br>  There is an ordinary person who wants to have a haircut.  Or go for a massage.  Or change tires with the onset of winter.  Or sit with a girl at your favorite table in a cafe nearby.  He can of course call at the reception desk and warn about his visit, or get to the desired point in the hope that he will be accepted and served there.  Or, you can log in from your smartphone on <a href="http://picktime.ru/">PickTime.ru</a> and, without any registration in 2-3 clicks, book the right time in the right place.  And then tell friends about this convenient service.  It's simple. <br><br>  <b>And a little about the team:</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/picktime/blog/198446/">The first post</a> on behalf of our team was about startups.  We confess that the subject matter is really rather beaten up, and it‚Äôs too early for us to talk about what‚Äôs good and bad.  But thanks to this post we received the first feedback from you, and this is not bad.  We tried to take into account most of the criticisms, corrected a heap of bugs and hope that it is not in vain. <br>  We are always glad to cooperate and are open to both constructive criticism and business proposals. <br><br>  <b>In the near future we plan to add:</b> <br>  - Grouping organizations <br>  - Creation of individual pages adapted to the specific goals of the group <br>  - Statistics on profile views (for organizations) <br>  - Customer Analytics <br>  - Ability to promote your profile <br>  - Ability to create pages with individual design <br><br>  <b>For those who are too lazy to read:</b> <br>  <a href="http://picktime.ru/">PickTime</a> - electronic queue in the cloud <br>  For people - for free, without registration <br>  For organizations - free, short registration is required <br>  The goal of the project is to help people not stand in lines. <br>  The goal of the team is to make a convenient service for people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200604/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200604/</a></p>
