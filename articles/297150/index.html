We have 7 days that can be spent for the benefit of ourselves and our career.  Let's start with small and very effective steps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b2/a50/d6f/2b2a50d6f02748f09732773318a0eb60.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>// Monday</b> <br>  Upgrade LinkedIn profile </h4><h6>  Is it a hard day?  Not at all.  Today, this is your task: use all the functions of LinkedIn, which until then were left without your attention.  We even have a whole list of those 8 useful life hacking for this useful resource: which today will be useful to you. <br>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/8-poleznyh-funkcij-linkedin-o-kotoryh-vy-ne-znali/">Here, catch 8 LinkedIn chips that you didn't know about!</a> <br>  We also advise you to add as many keywords as possible to your profile.  Especially: if they relate to the projects you have worked on, or the characteristics of you personally.  We also talked about this in the material <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/kak-opisat-svoi-navyki-v-rezyume/">‚Äúhow to describe your skills in a resume‚Äù</a> . </h6>

    <h4>  <b>// Tuesday</b> <br>  Let's help a friend </h4><h6>  Tuesday will make the day of help for the unemployed and distressed friends.  In fact, today we offer you to apply all your skills in the field of networking and try to help a friend to find a good job (and among friends and loved ones there is always someone who is looking for it).  It is especially useful to turn all this to those who are not yet ready to give up work, but want to understand what is happening in the market. <br>  Firstly, it is good for your reputation as a person who constantly strives to help and support his neighbor.  Characterizes you as a professional and personality.  If in a circle of people who are interested in you from a career point of view, there are those who will be ready to help your friend, then you will probably be ready to turn to him at some point, and most likely he will come to you.  Once again, maintaining business contacts will be helpful.  Maybe it seems to you that this sounds cynical, but you should not make hasty conclusions! <br>  Secondly, you yourself will look at the job search differently; this process will no longer seem so unpleasant and scary when you find yourself as an ‚Äúindependent‚Äù expert and try to help someone. <br>  Thirdly, it is just karma. <br>  Fourth, you will become the person who will be immediately informed about new vacancies.  Is it bad? </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>// Wednesday</b> <br>  Watching ourselves </h4><h6>  On Wednesday, you need to do this.  Work all day as usual.  But try to pay more attention to how you perform your duties, what brings you pleasure, how much time you spend, when your qualities show up as a leader or a responsible employee.  Maybe you ingeniously cope with stress?  All this must be recorded as soon as you notice something special behind you that may take place in your resume or cover letter.  It will also be just great if you recall any story that will personify all your qualities as an employee and write it down.  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/zolotye-pravila-storitellinga/">Storytelling in the summary, letters, and during the interview, has not been canceled.</a> </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>// Thursday</b> <br>  Check your online reputation </h4><h6>  So we got to the social networks.  Today you should pay attention to all your profiles, because today all HRs will certainly find you, all your black jokes, endless selfies and so on.  Of course, you should not immediately clean up everything that you published back in the bearded year of 2007, but just pay attention to the fact that it can spoil your online reputation.  Okay, at least sign off from MDK.  By the way, to subscribe to icanchoose would be worth it.  After all, a candidate who always seeks to obtain useful information is, a priori, an excellent employee! <br>  In general, your profile in social networks should not be too gray or boring, too loaded with professional information ( <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/zolotye-pravila-storitellinga/">we are about VC, for example, there is not very appropriate</a> , but on the FB there can already be some useful information about you, good, there is a section for this).  Do you know what a recruiter checks when entering your page?  Your adequacy and liveliness.  Keep in mind! <br>  We have already talked about <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/podskazki-dlya-vedeniya-stranicy-v-socsetyah-dlya-soiskatele/">what to do with your profile</a> so that it looks good. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>// Friday</b> <br>  Reflecting on the recommendations </h4><h6>  Your colleagues can certainly tell something good about your professional skills (and you just close your eyes to what they were doing on the corporate party).  Therefore, today we advise you to think about who among the colleagues could tell something about you, think about the projects that you carried out together.  After all, sooner or later almost all of us need to change jobs, and we underestimate the tool of recommendations. <br>  How to do it? <br>  Write letters.  Better come during lunch.  If you have not yet informed your colleagues that you are going to leave the present place of work, this is the time.  However, the rule of praise and scolding also applies here.  Only praise, ask.  Sincerely tell about those moments that you have experienced and that made you cooler as a professional.  A team for that and a team.  In general, do not be shy about the fact that you are changing your job and even more so when you ask someone to become your confidant in these matters. <br>  If you are very tight with communication (you are our outgoing!), Then send a request to LinkedIn.  Just first still warn that you are considering the option of changing the workplace.  Especially if you ask for a manager.  Do not catch a man by surprise! </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>// Saturday</b> <br>  Trying to understand what the employer wants </h4><h6>  The best that a candidate can do is to meet the requirements and study the situation on the market and in the company.  It is important.  Who is aware, he is armed!  That is why on Saturday it is worth doing research, analyze key words in the described vacancy, read reviews on Glassdoor about what is important to the company, what questions are asked, what is expected of the employees, get acquainted with the values ‚Äã‚Äãand just understand what the employer wants and how he sees </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>// Sunday</b> <br>  Thinking about how to get better </h4><h6>  Let us agree that you will not devote all day to a hectic job search.  Sit in the morning and look for useful courses for yourself, and maybe you will find useful classes for advanced training?  The world of information gave us the opportunity to improve without limits.  That is why start a new week of your life by making an investment in the future, starting to learn something really interesting, something that will make you a little better. <br><br>  By the way, recruiters like it when candidates have information about courses in their resumes.  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/darim-vozmozhnosti-13-luchshih-onlajn-kursov-dekabrya-ot-uor/">And we just have a selection of the best courses in December.</a> </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297150/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297150/</a></p>
