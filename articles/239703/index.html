New systems exceed the ‚Äúcost / performance‚Äù indicators of general-purpose servers by 20%, (1) (2), thus offering a more profitable alternative to customers. <br><br>  The explosive growth of big data ‚Äî more than 2.5 quintillas of data generated by devices every day ‚Äî sets organizations in the task of building powerful technological infrastructures to extract valuable information from these arrays.  Commonly used general purpose servers today are based on a closed processor technology, and are often used at the limit of their capacity due to the workload associated with processing big data, as well as cloud and mobile computing.  IBM, in turn, introduces a new approach to data processing systems that unites the efforts of the OpenPOWER Foundation consortium.  Launched at the end of 2013, the consortium is developing rapidly, and today includes 59 companies working to expand the capabilities of the IBM POWER processor to promote innovation in the industry.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúThe open model of doing business and our approach within OpenPOWER will replace technology suppliers that offer proprietary private solutions created within the walls of a single company,‚Äù said Doug Balog, CEO of Power Systems, IBM Systems &amp; Technology Group.  ‚ÄúThe new technology will provide customers with a greater choice and help them get valuable information as quickly as possible for the subsequent solution of business problems.‚Äù <br><br>  The new IBM Power S824L servers are based on the IBM POWER8 processor, the world's first chip optimized for the most demanding loads in the field of big data processing.  (3) IBM and other members of the OpenPOWER consortium, including the NVIDIA GPU accelerator, are securely integrated into new systems to provide unrivaled computing power so that banks can better assess risks, energy companies more accurately determine oil fields, and scientists promptly select the right methods for treating patients. <br><br>  Based on OpenPOWER technologies, (4) Power S824L systems provide customers with the ability to run tasks with intensive data exchange on the POWER8 processor, while reducing the load on other computational tasks related to processing big data using NVIDIA GPU accelerators parallel mode and designed specifically to speed up the work of demanding applications. <br>  As part of the further adaptation of GPU accelerators for Power Systems, IBM plans to optimize its entire portfolio of enterprise applications for working with big data, including IBM DB2 databases with BLU Acceleration support.  Moreover, IBM is also working on optimizing the GPU-accelerated Power architecture for applications used in bioinformatics, financial and defense sectors, molecular dynamics, weather modeling - including SOAP3, NAMD, GROMACS, FFTW and Quantum Espresso libraries. <br><br>  Next-generation IBM Power Systems will support NVIDIA NVLink technology, which provides high-speed data exchange between the central and graphics processors using the PCI Express interface.  This will allow Nvidia GPU accelerators to access the memory of IBM POWER processors, as well as increase the performance of numerous enterprise applications.  Such systems will be available for order in early 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a96/38c/041/a9638c041c4f4e0d910e3b891d5ff96d.png"><br><br><h3>  IBM POWER8 Extended Portfolio </h3><br><br>  In addition to Power S824L systems with GPU accelerators, the IBM Power Systems portfolio based on POWER8 processors also includes: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>IBM Data Engine for NoSQL</b> .  By combining innovative technology with members of the OpenPOWER Redis Labs, Canonical, Altera, and IBM consortium, this solution significantly reduces the cost base for NoSQL datastores.  The solution includes Redis Labs software, Canonical's Ubuntu Linux operating system, Altera's programmable logic integrated circuit and Power System S822L unique CAPI system with IBM FlashSystem 840. Thanks to the consolidation of computing resources, you can use only one POWER8 server instead of 24 Intel-based systems for full-size NoSQL storage.  (5) The multiple cost reduction is realized precisely because of the small footprint and the corresponding reduction in energy costs.  Customers can implement new features and grow NoSQL storage using 40 TB of flash memory within a single server. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>IBM Data Engine for Analytics - Power Systems Edition</b> .  Combining POWER8-based systems with flash-based elastic storage technology and Platform Computing software, this new analytical solution can use a third of the storage infrastructure required by x86-based solutions.  (6) <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Power Enterprise Systems.</b>  Built on the industry's fastest processor, (7) new Power Enterprise Systems expands the POWER8-based scale-out server lineup introduced in April and is optimized for demanding enterprise applications and computing environments.  The new Power E870 and Power E880 systems are the most powerful 8-socket servers in the industry, providing support for up to 1000 virtual memory systems per computing system.  (8) With the possibility of using up to 32, 40 or 48 processor cores, as well as up to 4 TB of memory per compute module, these systems are designed to increase modular efficiency and scale up to 192 cores with the support of 1500 computational power flows and 16 TB of memory.  Power Enterprise Systems can run on AIX, IBM i and Linux, offering customers reliable support for the most demanding applications. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Power Enterprise Pools.</b>  Offering a powerful foundation for private, public, and hybrid cloud systems, Enterprise Pools provides unrivaled flexibility and constantly responds to infrastructure changes.  Power Enterprise Pools provide customers with the ability to allocate resources across a ‚Äúpool‚Äù of systems in order to meet load requirements, ensure system availability, improve operational efficiency, and protect investments when switching to POWER8. <br><br>  New IBM Power Systems will be available for order in a variety of configurations, starting October 31, 2014. <br><br><h3>  Funding proposal </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f50/d81/4e1/f50d814e18e24dd8a30501435e92c8ed.png"><br><br>  IBM Global Financing provides customers with options available to order the latest IBM solutions.
