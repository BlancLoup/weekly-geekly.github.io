I am for standards and I make valid.  But I am for standards not at all for the same reason as you.  Do not like it - pass by, do not read further.  Adequate people: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I found an article about 15 advantages of XHTML (http://www.i2r.ru/static/476/out_23437.shtml).  The author writes: ‚ÄúI just want to acquaint the reader with the indisputable advantages that CSS layout has.‚Äù  Consider these "undeniable" benefits. <br><br><blockquote>  1. XHTML is the current published hypertext markup standard, replacing HTML. </blockquote>

      So what?  Is this an advantage?  This is just a fact.  What is the advantage for the company that owns the site, say, in the next year after launch? <br><br><blockquote>  2. XHTML is more consistent than HTML, which reduces the likelihood of errors. </blockquote><br><br>  What does "more consistent" mean?  The likelihood of errors depends not on the language, but on the person. <br><br><blockquote>  3. New browsers "love" XHTML (in particular XHTML 1.0).  Because  it provides additional features not available in HTML and has a clear syntax. </blockquote><br><br>  Is this an advantage?  What does ‚Äúlove‚Äù mean?  In what form is this expressed?  What are the benefits and how does this ‚Äúlove‚Äù give?  What exactly HTML has a ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù syntax? <br><br><blockquote>  4. XHTML is a subset of the XML language, which allows us to significantly expand the possibilities of document formatting, and in the future will allow us to fully use all new, possibly still unrecognized or unapproved technologies. </blockquote><br><br>  Ok, he is a subset.  It must be awesome.  What is the particular advantage? <br><br><blockquote>  5. XHTML is part of the Web standards family (also including CSS and W3C DOM), which allows you to control the appearance and behavior of a page across platforms, browsers, and devices. </blockquote><br><br>  It's great that he is part of the family.  About standards was in paragraph 1, so this is already attracted for the sake of a beautiful figure.  Interestingly, before XHTML could not control?  How, then, did the sites?  Or now they can?  Then why so much torment so that it looks the same in different browsers with a more or less complex design? <br><br><blockquote>  6. XHTML opens the way to the world of metadata, which can be argued with a high degree of probability that will allow search engines to more correctly and accurately process data in XHTML documents (read the pages of the site). </blockquote><br><br>  How poetic!  They open the way.  And what does this give site owners here and now?  And in HTML, I could not use meta tags?  Could  They search engines together scored. <br><br><blockquote>  7. XHTML allows you to change the order of the content in the document, which also gives its advantages in search engine optimization. </blockquote><br><br>  Well, still all right. <br><br><blockquote>  8. XHTML improves site availability for a wider audience, such as people with visual or coordination impairments.  This means that in practice, screen readers will not be confused when they see the &lt;table&gt; tag in the body of the document and try to display its contents as some tabular information.  It will also be possible to fully and most importantly comfortably use the site even in the absence of a mouse. </blockquote><br><br>  Accept only for humanistic reasons.  In Russia, here and now for most sites it does not matter.  The audience is not the same.  For those who sell cars or computer games, it makes no difference whether, in addition to the 500,000 visitors, a couple from the braille terminal will read. <br><br><blockquote>  9. XHTML increases the availability of the site also for a larger range of user-agents: PDAs, mobile phones, digital projectors, and other devices with access to the web.  This means that it is no longer necessary to create several versions of the site, since  one XHTML template is taken, to which various style sheets are applied on request. </blockquote><br><br>  I do not think this is right.  If I go out from the PDA via GPRS, I don‚Äôt want to load the whole page, so that later, through CSS, the excess is removed from the already loaded one.  I want the extra to not load and I consider it right to do separate versions for the PDA and mobile with adapted content and navigation, optimized for traffic. <br><br><blockquote>  10. XHTML eliminates the need to create a separate version of the page for printing, because  when printing a document to print, it is also possible to set a separate style.  This advantage, as well as the advantage in paragraph 6 of the inaccessible tabular markup, because  Pre-formatting is already created in the body of the document. </blockquote><br><br>  Sorry moa, this is how you markup do it. <br><br><blockquote>  11. XHTML + CSS can significantly reduce the weight of the document.  Thus, you significantly reduce the load on the servers, communication channels and accelerate the issuance of the finished document to the user.  This is achieved due to the fact that the XHTML template does not contain markup elements, since  they are taken out the css file.  For a more visual confirmation of this argument, we turn to an example.  Typically, the difference between XHTML + CSS and HTML + CSS (tabular) templates ranges from 300 to 500 percent in favor of XHTML + CSS, in some cases it may be more.  Imagine an imaginary site with a total attendance of 10,000 unique visitors per day.  We make it first in a classic tabular way.  We get - the size of the HTML template is 20 KB with a style file of 5 KB.  So, for the first time, the site issued to the user's browser caches all images, scripts rendered into external files and style files, i.e.  CSS files.  Also in the calculations we take for granted that the site design (CSS-file) will not be subject to change during the year and will not require re-loading.  Scripts and images can be ignored, because  they will not affect the final result.  (20 KB * 10000 * 365 + 5 * 10000) / 1024 = 71337 MB or 71.3 GB of traffic during the calendar year.  We build the same site on XHTML + CSS using CSS layout.  The output of XHTML is 5 Kb and CSS is 10 Kb (it should be noted here that the size of the CSS file usually increases due to the fact that all the data on the formatting and the visual presentation of the document are put into the CSS file).  We will carry out the calculation.  (5 Kb * 10000 * 365 + 10 * 10000) / 1024 = 17919.9 Mb or 18 Gb traffic.  In this example, the savings is 71.3 GB - 18 GB = 53.3 GB!  Comments are superfluous. </blockquote><br><br>  Ho ho!  I saw a lot of examples when layout on layers without tables took up more space.  Want examples?  Ask Yandex. <br><br><blockquote>  12. XHTML, due to the removal of elements and instructions for formatting a document into an external file, allows the user to upload content to the user's browser as quickly as possible, and as he proceeds to read it, the site design will continue to load.  This allows, without waiting for the full page load, to decide whether the presented information is significant, or whether it is worth leaving the page and continue searching for information on other sites. </blockquote><br><br>  I could use CSS in HTML too.  And even with tables.  Not counted item. <br><br><blockquote>  13. XHTML code is more logical and simple, so it is much easier for HTML coders who have not written the page code to understand it. </blockquote><br><br>  It depends on who writes the code. <br><br><blockquote>  14. XHTML allows, having one template, to connect to it an infinite number of styles that drastically change its design without a single edit of the template itself.  This is achieved by manipulating the free block markup of the contents as opposed to a rigidly given table. </blockquote><br><br>  There are specific examples when it was necessary to do this on a real commercial site and it was not necessary to make a single edit in the template? <br><br><blockquote>  15. XHTML is handled correctly by older browsers, which reduces barriers to its use.  And in the new, due to the correct support of CSS, you can achieve incredible results. </blockquote><br><br>  Yes?  IE3 NN4?  :-) Just kidding.  That's about the results.  Business needs not ‚Äúincredible results‚Äù, but tangible financial results.  ;-) <br><br>  <strong>Questions to readers</strong> <br><br>  What advantages do you see: <br>  1. For business, site owners <br>  2. For myself as developers </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3741/</a></p>
