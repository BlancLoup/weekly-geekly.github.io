This post is addressed to girls who happened to meet or even marry an IT person, and tells something about the strengths and weaknesses of your elects.  In addition, I think it will not hurt to read it to the guys: perhaps it will help to understand the reason for the indignation of your beloved. <br><br><h4>  Five reasons to marry an IT person </h4><br><h5>  1. Reliability and responsibility </h5><br>  Most of my colleagues I know have a high sense of responsibility - it seems to be done willy-nilly in the course of professional activity.  Marrying you, the IT specialist will take responsibility for your comfort and prosperity, and, you can be sure, will do everything to provide them.  It is also worth mentioning the ability to focus on the goal and achieve it: usually quiet and motionlessly meditating at the monitor, your elect may show rabid activity and in an incredibly short period of time move mountains.  For example, if at some point he realizes that it‚Äôs not good for a second month to sit in a torn-up dwelling, by the end of next week you can find yourself in a clean and renovated apartment.  It is also verified from personal experience that one programmer can, in two or three hours, bring into perfect order a two-room apartment, which has been littered with common efforts during the previous month.

    <h5>  2. Interesting interlocutor </h5><br>  Contrary to popular stereotype, most IT people have a passion beyond the scope of their main specialty, and almost all of them can talk a lot about this topic, <i>understandably</i> and interestingly.  In obedience to the habit gained in the main profession, your boyfriend delves into all the subtleties of his hobby, and if you can find this topic, you can learn a lot about the topic and about it.  There are a lot of musicians among my colleagues, some of them are great at drawing, some are addicted to martial arts (and not only their theoretical side), the fourth are avid collectors.  By the way, there are almost no gamers among them. <br><br>  If it so happens that you have a common hobby, you can only envy.  And if not, at the moment when your loved one understands what you are fond of, he will certainly undertake a little research, just to be able to truly appreciate your achievements, and of course, support the conversation.  However, alas, he is unlikely to discuss the latest fashion trends and the new album of a pop star ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  3. Family wealth </h5><br>  It is no secret that the salaries of programmers are now above average, whatever the country in question.  This means that your spouse will certainly be able to ensure a normal life for you and your children, even if your own salary is not too high.  Practice shows that in a large city (I will not say about small cities due to the lack of reliable information) even a recent graduate will be able to find a decent job.  Whatever you say, but marital happiness is severely tested, if in the morning there is nothing to eat, and the landlord threatens to be evicted for non-payment.  In general, you have a good chance to get coats and jewelry a little more than usual. <br><br>  By the way, if you are easy-going, and your young man is above average, you have a good chance to live in different cities, and even countries, at the expense of his employers. <br><br><h5>  4. Marital fidelity </h5><br>  In this matter, I probably embark on shaky ground, but still take the claim that many IT people are not inclined to adultery.  The fact is that most of them are very introvertive, and acquaintance with a girl implies a certain degree of openness and sociability.  And even if the competitor takes the initiative upon himself, he will hardly allow it into personal space at once, and even more so - to his own carcass :-) <br><br><h5>  5. Personal <s>programmer</s> sysadmin. </h5><br>  It is difficult to overestimate this item.  All computer equipment in your home will behave decently (well, if someone does not get carried away with experiments with firmware and the like), viruses will be quickly cleaned, the Internet is as stable as possible, and so on.  And even if you do not consider yourself to be fans of electronics, an unexpected porn banner will not prevent you from sitting on the Internet or driving a <s>sims</s> favorite toy. <br><br><h4>  Five reasons to think about before you go beyond IT </h4><br><h5>  1. Boredom?  Pedantry </h5><br>  It seems that one of the most painful problems, which of all IT people is most acutely manifested in programmers.  The habit of working with computers, expressing their thoughts in an understandable form for them also affects the style of communication with people.  Be prepared for the fact that your spouse will constantly ‚Äúcling to the wording,‚Äù correct you and annoy in every possible way.  It is not easy to check into this, but he does all this not from the desire to get the interlocutor, but on the contrary, from the sincere desire to understand what exactly you meant. <br><br>  The programs that we write, the computers with which we deal - all this belongs to a strictly formalized world, where every term and phenomenon has an exact definition, and we are used to operate with exact concepts.  Therefore, communicating with you, your spouse will automatically try to build the necessary definition base.  Alas, to communicate in a natural language, and even with living people, this is impossible.  And the only way to struggle with such tediousness is to gradually ‚Äúre-educate‚Äù your young man, trying not to get annoyed in the process. <br><br>  Another spouse will not require expressions hints and indirect signs, but to speak directly if you want something from him.  Just because hints are an even less reliable means of transmitting information than natural language. <br><br>  Another manifestation of pedantry is the propensity to plan everything.  Do not be surprised if your loved one asks you to announce a plan for the current week on Monday, and will be extremely indignant if you suddenly change your plans at the last moment.  There is nothing surprising in the fact that he wants to know your hourly plan for an evening rest, especially with regard to spending time together, and will be annoyed if these plans suddenly change.  The fact is that it makes it necessary to change his own <i>optimally</i> made plans, and he simply becomes offended for the efforts spent on planning. <br><br><h5>  2. Rationalist to the bone </h5><br>  It is also difficult for IT pros to understand your decisions when you make them, guided by emotions or momentary gusts.  Examples of such situations are textbook: three times to change the outfit before leaving the house, although there is already waiting for a taxi downstairs, to demand an immediate trip to the store, since ‚Äúthere is nothing to wear‚Äù.  In the latter case, he will think or even say something like: ‚ÄúHow can there be nothing ?!  Wardrobe and so full!  By the way, you can make n! / (K! (Nk)!) Different outfits from this junk, where k is the number of clothes you have worn and n is the number of available ones. ‚Äù <br><br>  Here, as in the previous case, you will not undertake anything except gradual ‚Äúre-education‚Äù.  Fortunately, your beloved is quite able, over time, to understand and learn to predict your impulsive decisions that he will solve this and the previous problem. <br><br><h5>  3. Forget about coats </h5><br>  If you are already happy, after reading about a good salary, I have to upset you.  Instead of a pretty brooch for the new year, you will surely get some kind of gadget, at least if you do not hint that you want a brooch or fur coat for the holiday.  However, about the hints, see above. <br><br><h5>  4. You will have to love the technique </h5><br>  Unfortunately, you can not get away from talking about the next technical innovation, gadget or service.  You probably will try to transplant on a smartphone, replace sms with WhatsApp, describing its excellent advantages, and, in some cases, meanly replace the usual Windows with Ubuntu.  And then there are two ways out: either try to sort it out a little, in order to understand at least a little about what the husband is saying, or divorce.  On the other hand, you don‚Äôt need to become an IT-girl yourself, you just need to become a confident user and understand why you don‚Äôt want Ubuntu. <br><br><h5>  5. High life </h5><br>  In the first half, I already mentioned the introversion of IT people.  There is an unpleasant manifestation of this trait: you should not expect that your chosen one will want to regularly go to clubs and participate in drunkenness.  On his own initiative, he will most likely take you to the cinema, theater or, at most, to a concert of your favorite band, and even then not very often.  So it is necessary to seek a compromise and sometimes feel free to take the initiative. <br><br><h4>  A few words in conclusion </h4><br>  The text was rather long, longer than I expected, but I don‚Äôt want to split it into two posts.  I wanted to emphasize that IT specialists have their advantages and disadvantages, like any other people, I hope I succeeded.  Fortunately, most of the shortcomings over time, "heal" - pumped the skill of family life, forgive me such a formulation.  If you happen to feel these problems do not imagine, do not worry, do not get angry, do not be offended.  It is better to try to gently point out to your loved one his mistakes, and in time he will correct.  If you suddenly find yourself in some of the items, do not wait until they tell you, change, and your sweetheart will be pleasantly surprised. <br><br>  <i>PS I did not find a hub more suitable than "Chulan", if there is any more correct one - tell me.</i> <br><br>  UPD: I suggest habrayusers and their girls / wives to replenish both the first and second lists from personal experience.  And I will try to supplement the post.  You look, the benefits of fasting will increase. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207900/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207900/</a></p>
