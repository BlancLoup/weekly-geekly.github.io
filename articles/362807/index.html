Practically all travelers face it in one way or another.  When we travel by plane, arriving in a country whose time zone is significantly different from our ‚Äúhome‚Äù, we find ourselves in a state of desynchronization.  For example, we are overcome by sleep and fatigue, because at home it is deep night, and here, in another country, it is early morning or end of the day.  When in a foreign land we go down the ramp at night, then we are cheerful, full of energy and want to do something.  That's just dark, everything is closed and nothing works. <br><br>  Fortunately, there is no need to lose the first vacation day for adaptation and acclimatization.  It is enough to properly prepare for the flight to the ‚Äúfar‚Äù time zone, and the addiction will take place much faster and softer.  No, we will not advise you to the workers 'and peasants' method in the form of a quick abundant libation in order to fall and fall asleep.  This is just the first way to completely lose the first day, or even two, a completely non-constructive approach.  No, instead we want to offer you other intensive adaptation measures that do not harm the body and do not steal precious vacation time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Preparation and planning </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf8/f1d/eae/bf8f1deaeed74f13adbcdebfd2df389d.jpg">

      <br>
      Preparing for adaptation must begin before the flight. <br><br>  Best of all, if your departure will occur in the afternoon or late in the evening.  The reason is simple: you can have dinner in a normal setting and have a good night‚Äôs sleep before arriving in another time zone and climate.  Depending on the duration of the flight and the number of time zones crossed, you will arrive at your destination in the morning or at lunch.  This is the best time to synchronize your biorhythms and daily routine. <br><br>  Try to plan the first day as fully as possible, so that you don‚Äôt have to solve all sorts of questions and problems on the spot in a not very good physical condition. <br><br>  It is advisable to at least 1-2 days before departure to avoid any activity that could worsen your health.  By this we mean, first of all, a hangover, gastrointestinal upset and colds. <br><br>  If the daily routine allows it, then try a few days before the flight, start gradually shifting your sleep time towards the time zone to which you will soon fly.  For example, every time you go to bed an hour earlier or later than the day before.  If you fly to the west, then wake up and go to bed later, if to the east - earlier. <br><br>  Finally, try to take these breaks between meals for 12-16 hours (preferably 16) so that your internal clocks become less dependent on these events.  According to animal behavior studies, if food is available only during sleep hours, the circadian rhythm shifts to ensure sustenance.  So do not neglect the experience of biologists and try to starve more during the day.  Of course, in addition to mixing sleep time. <br><br>  You can also recommend a specially developed diet in the 1980s, which helps speed up adaptation to a different time zone.  The diet is called Argonne Anti-Jet-Lag Diet, and is named after the Argonne National Laboratory of the US Department of Energy, where it was developed.  Military research in 2002 confirmed the effectiveness of this diet.  It consists in alternating ‚Äúfeasting days‚Äù (food with a high content of proteins and carbohydrates) and ‚Äúfasting days‚Äù (mainly broths, vegetable salads and toasts), as well as drinking coffee and other caffeine-containing beverages only at certain hours. <br><br><h4>  Stick to the rules </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/240/6a7/29c/2406a729cf7c440eb33df2616593928c.jpg"><br><br>  Upon arrival, try as soon as possible to begin to adhere to the local daily routine.  What is meant by this: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not go to bed immediately upon arrival (if the appropriate time has not yet arrived here). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Eat ‚Äúright‚Äù food at the ‚Äúright‚Äù time.  That is, do not eat plenty of meat and fat for breakfast just because your body thinks it's lunchtime.  Otherwise drowsiness will fall on you.  Also, avoid all kinds of snacks (nuts, chocolates, chips, etc.) at night, especially if traveling with children. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Eliminate alcohol and caffeinated beverages for the first time.  Yes, we know that vacation is a time of relaxation and rest, but both of these groups of drinks seriously impair the quality of sleep. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not rush to see as many sights as you can on the first day, give yourself time to adjust.  Especially not zealous in the morning and evening hours. <br><br>  A good helper in the adaptation is the ambient lighting.  If you need to cheer up after the climb, then choose, if possible, a sunny place, or at least open the curtains wide open.  Conversely, in the evening and at night try to surround yourself with darkness, including using a mask over your eyes.  All this will help you synchronize your circadian rhythm with the surrounding reality.  The <a href="http://www.britishairways.com/travel/drsleep/public/en_us">Jet Lag Advisor</a> web page on the British Airways website can also help you with this.  On it you can find out at what time it is better to avoid bright lighting, and at what time - vice versa. <br><br>  Do not forget about earplugs, extremely useful thing for trying to fall asleep.  We also recommend that you observe the rituals of preparation and bedtime that are usual for you, this will help the brain to decrease activity and tune in to rest.  If you have never had any such rituals (for example, be sure to wear pajamas with a night-cap, or read three pages from Kafka in bed), then just lie down comfortably, close your eyes and focus on your breathing. <br><br><h4>  Return to the old routine </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94c/a1e/ede/94ca1eede60a437aa9926843127bc5ce.jpg"><br><br>  Everything ever ends, including a vacation.  It is necessary to return not only home, but also to your usual temporal rhythm.  Try to plan your vacation in such a way that you don‚Äôt have to go to work the next day (or, God forbid, on the same day).  No, the next day is necessary to devote a reverse adaptation, then to immediately get down to business. <br>  During this period, try to eat light, healthy food, and also avoid alcohol and caffeine for a good night‚Äôs sleep.  Again, we recommend using the bedtime ritual, or, as plan B, observing your own breathing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362807/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362807/</a></p>
