  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Apple doesn‚Äôt really like Flash, and what‚Äôs with Android</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I have seen a lot of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Flash_Platform/90586/">discussions</a> about the opposition of Apple and Adobe.  And basically they boil down to the fact that Apple is great, and Adobe and Flash are the root of all ills ... <br><br>  It seems to me that most discussing people simply do not see the forest behind individual trees.  Their attention is so distracted by the swearing between the leaderships of large and well-known corporations, that it‚Äôs not particularly noticeable of the main trend. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Trend </h4><br>  Today we are witnessing the emergence of a terrific market ‚Äî small, universal human assistants who can (or will be able in the future) help him connect with anyone and in any way, get the right information anywhere and on any subject of the environment, perform millions of other useful functions, and finally just have fun.  It is likely that in 5-10 years such helpers (greatly improved) will be on almost every person on the planet, and life without them will seem impossible.  To underestimate the importance of this market is very difficult.  And the war for it will be serious, as well as winning the winner. <br><br><h4>  Roots of evil </h4><br>  How does the <em>hardware of</em> HTC Hero differ from the iPhone?  And from the Nokia N900?  Just please do not compare OSes, screen sizes or the presence of a keyboard.  I ask you to ask the question ‚ÄúWhat can the iPhone do that you couldn‚Äôt technically be able to do with an Android phone?‚Äù.  The correct answer is that the hardware capabilities are identical. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And if so, then <strong>each developer who created an application for the iPhone (for example) is simply obliged to think about releasing it on other mobile platforms with minimal gestures.</strong> <br><br>  It is absolutely clear!  The ideal option for a developer is to write an application, poke the ‚Äúget versions for different devices‚Äù button, and happily make money from the result.  Any differences of platforms cause a lot of problems with the development and support of the code!  Just imagine that you have to rewrite your game with ActionScript in C ++, Java, Objective-C ... and then accompany all four versions of the code, simultaneously improving, correcting errors, etc. <br><br>  Therefore, <strong>the software development industry has always encouraged the creation of tools for the rapid transfer of applications from one platform to another with minimal modifications.</strong>  There are lots of examples: Java, Mono, OpenGL, Qt, HTML, CSS, JavaScript ... this list can be continued for a very long time. <br><br>  It is also clear that <em>platform</em> developers <em>are</em> not interested in portability.  Each program for the platform is a competitive advantage ("I will not sit behind your Linux, Photoshop does not work on it").  <strong>The goal of platform creators is to make it as difficult as possible to transfer programs to other platforms</strong> . <br><br>  And now I will quote from the blog of Ilya Birman: <br><blockquote>  Who does not know, the other day Eply made changes to the developer's agreement, in accordance with which the <strong>programs for iPhone should be written in ObjC / C / C ++ and compiled with standard means</strong> . </blockquote><br>  Personally, I have been waiting for this for a long time.  Apple can talk about usability, about the full use of the capabilities of the platform, bydlokoderov to Flash (as if somewhere they are not), etc.  They may blame Adobe for quality, but the real reason is not the case.  The real reason is <strong>to force the developer to choose one platform, the most popular at that time, and then make it as difficult as possible to transfer the application to another</strong> .  And Apple was excited not only by the new Flash compiler, but also by the emergence of MonoTouch, and other similar tools that have already begun to grow like mushrooms after rain. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  Apple‚Äôs behavior is nothing out of the ordinary ‚Äî it's just business, they need to maximize profits.  You can come up with motives for any behavior, but in business there will most likely be money. <br><br>  PS We need to understand that in the long run such a business leads to a decrease in competition, higher prices, and stagnation in the development of technology.  Therefore, I personally bought HTC Hero, based on Android. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90620/</a></p>
