Now they called him Georgie-kun) sat in the university canteen.  Jason handled.  Ayfrank did not call him.  He had already almost decided several times to take advantage of Eve’s offer, but it seemed that he was holding something.  If there was the Internet, he thought evil, one could search for something about these damn clubs.  Why is it all so wrong? <br><br>  “Hey, Jay, you haven't been your own for the last couple of days,” said Mac, “what are you saying?” <br>  “I think I know what's the matter,” said Eugene, “I think the provider of our friend Jay received the Internet through the university base station.”  And now our friend Jay is sitting without the Internet for how much?  Three days?  Four days? <br>  - A-ha-ha-ha!  - Sergey laughed, - boy, are you addicted! <br>  “Go to hell,” Jason snapped.  Eugene looked reproachfully at Sergei.  George alternately looked at everyone. <br>  “Jay, why didn't you say anything?”  - asked Mac, - if you want, we will find an empty audience, read the last dump from my computer? <br>  - Online read-only?  - asked Jason, - when it is impossible to throw new links in the outbox?  When no one can write messages?  Sorry, but it's like making love to a rubber woman. <br>  Everyone was silent. <br>  - Jason, let me update your flash drive with your provider?  - suggested Mac. <br>  - I do not want. <br>  - Do not want? <br>  - Not. <br>  - Why? <br>  Jason sighed. <br>  - It seems you need a little rest.  Good thing it happened.  I have time to think about myself.  Look from the side, do you understand?  For example, yesterday I was walking in the park. <br>  Eugene shook his head.  Sergey raised his eyebrows. <br>  “Thank you friends,” said Jason, “but I really will rest.”  It seems to be to my advantage. <br>  “Okay,” Mac said shortly, and everyone started to eat.

      After a couple, Eugene intercepted Jason in the hallway. <br>  “We need to talk,” he said. “One link came to me.”  From one dude.  It is very interesting.  And I would like to show you this ... umm ... information.  I need your advice. <br>  - Dude name is not Huy?  - asked Jason.  Eugene looked at him in surprise. <br>  - You know? <br>  “No,” said Jason, “he sent me a link too, but I didn't have time to read it.” <br>  “Then all the more you should know,” said Eugene, “I printed out the text.”  You'll read it at home, ”he handed Jason an opaque folder,“ only for God's sake, don't leave it on the bus. ”  And best of all burn it after.  It is not joke. <br><br>  At home, Jason climbed into a chair and looked at the folder for a long time.  “What the hell?” He thought and opened it.  Inside was only one sheet with a brief text.  Jason began to read. <br><br>  “Hello, dear geek!” - the letter began.  Jason chuckled.  He had never heard of geeks being called "respected."  “My name is Jeremy O'Reilly, and I work for Google.  You probably know about the glorious past of our company in the distant in time, but close to us in the spirit of the two thousand years.  Contrary to public opinion, our company has a no less glorious present, but it is hidden from the eyes of the public.  The fact is that the Internet is alive now, perhaps no less than before.  Not some geeks use the Internet, although we very much respect their desire for freedom of information.  Modern society is unthinkable without the Internet, no matter what the media says.  The governments of almost all countries, various transnational corporations - their work is impossible without the Network.  Without the Web and without Google.  If you read these lines, you can assume that you have received an official invitation to work in our company.  We need young people, students in higher education, and familiar with the architecture of the Network - such as you.  Together with us you will support the work of the Internet around the world - and this is a very important and responsible work necessary for peace and stability on the planet. <br><br>  Naturally, this means round-the-clock and unlimited internet access. <br>  In case you are not interested in our offer, we ask you to keep this information confidential.  If you agree, just click OK. ” <br><br>  Jason leaned back in his chair.  To say that he was amazed was to say nothing.  His fingers trembled, his eyes gleaming feverishly.  He somehow got into bed, and, wrapped in a blanket, stared at the ceiling. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Jason and Eugene sat on the penultimate party in a lecture on intelligent systems.  Jason liked this subject, but today he could not concentrate and, pursing his lips, silently looked at the table.  Eugene scatteredly turned the handle in his hands and also paid little attention to the lecturer.  Finally Jason said: <br>  “About that link ...” <br>  - BUT?  - Eugene asked, - about the link? <br>  - It seems to me… <br>  “You know, Jay,” Eugene interrupted him, and Jason realized that he had already decided everything, and his opinion, although it would be carefully listened to, would not affect anything.  It remained only to listen to the new theory, and agree with her, however, as usual with Eugene, when he had already made a decision. <br>  “You can never stop, Jay.”  I think so.  You do not think that you can just sit on the Internet for the rest of your life?  Sixty-year olds running around with flash drives to providers is no longer funny. <br>  - Well yes. <br>  - What are the prospects in this area?  The day before yesterday there was only one - to become a provider.  Well, or the developer of illegal software, or an illegal system administrator.  One hell, it's all outside the law. <br>  - You're right. <br>  - But now I see real prospects for development.  I clicked OK, he finished suddenly. <br>  - I guess I'm happy for you. <br>  - You do not agree with me? <br>  - No, you said everything correctly.  You can not stop and all that.  But it seems to me that this is not entirely fair, ”Jason said quietly. <br>  - What is not entirely fair? <br>  - You see ... I used to think that the Internet is the real path to freedom.  That is, it is freedom.  When I understood why he was banned, and what he could give to people, I thought - this is it.  And I wanted to be a part of it.  I wanted, if not to give people freedom of information, then at least to bring this moment closer.  Or even just participate in it.  I was even proud that I was lucky to learn more about the Internet than what was said on TV, I was proud that I was a geek. <br>  “Why are you telling me this?”  I'm not George, I can tell you the same thing. <br>  - But now it seems to me that this is a big deception.  That is not a complete deception, but as if I had seen part of the picture before.  And now it has opened much wider. <br>  “Maybe it's even wider, so it seems to you now,” said Eugene. <br>  - May be.  Most likely, of course.  And it's not a deception case.  You correctly said that you can not stop.  I, like you, now see two paths.  But I do not see that one of them could be mine. <br>  They were silent. <br>  - It's hard to be an idealist, Jason. <br>  - Especially if you are an idealist not in theory, but in practice. <br>  Eugene turned away and began to carefully look at the board, as if suddenly very interested in intelligent systems.  Jason noticed Mack looking in front of them in front of them.  He propped up his head with his hand, took a pen and began to draw geometric figures in a notebook. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  A week later, Ayfranc called.  “Did you miss?  Come, ”he said shortly.  But Jason did not immediately go to him.  For about half a day he was engaged in meaningless chores around the house, but in the end he took the prepared flash drive and went to the provider.  Apparently, his expression was so harsh that Iffrank refrained from commenting, took the money and just silently returned the updated flash drive. <br><br>  Jason walked home on foot, looking absently around him.  It was late autumn, and almost all the trees were bare.  He stopped at the bridge and watched for a long time how the river lazily carried the last leaves into the distance.  Suddenly there were screams overhead.  He lifted his head and saw a wedge of geese, hurrying south to warmth.  Jason swung wide and threw the flash drive into the river. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  This is the ending of Jason and the Internet, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/cyberpunk/76104/">first part is here</a> .
