  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Club "Cyber-zone" or Robotomochilovo</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In childhood, after repeated viewing of the film of the new fantastic movie short film "Short Circuit" (1986), a dream appeared - to have something similar.  At about the same time, the book ‚ÄúDo not count the robot of professions‚Äù became desktop.  It turned out that in addition to the Fifth Number there are a bunch of other types of robots, so the dream has changed a bit - I wanted at least something robust.  I have no problems with mechanics and electronics (jo hands), so I haven‚Äôt mastered it myself over the past 25 years.  And I did not find anything interesting in the sale, but what I found was worth the incredible money.  For some time now, it has become more or less possible to make all sorts of interesting control pieces, taking as a basis the finished hardware controller and the finished hardware chassis, and then adding some self-made control software to them.  If there were usually no problems with writing software and searching for a suitable controller, there were always big troubles with the chassis (and indeed with the mechanical part). <br><br>  That's why I just wrote boiling water after I came across THEM: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fb1c3510/422e8d64/735fe9b0/c2aaadc2.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, fumbling once again on Yandex, I stumbled upon a <a href="http://roboforum.ru/forum104/topic9310.html">discussion of some ‚ÄúRobot Wars‚Äù</a> at the robot forum.  After reading a few pages and watching the video, emotions went off scale.  The hall in a shopping center in St. Petersburg, through which it drives a dozen of operator-controlled robots.  Operators are simple visitors to the shopping center, which for some money is given to play war games on robots.  The operator puts on glasses (FatShark), picks up a wireless joystick - and the soul rushes over the bumps ... <br><br>  In short, the guys realize the dream of childhood (them) - to make real fighting robots.  And quietly moving in this direction.  The development of all nodes is carried out almost from scratch.  Read the details at the robot forum, I will not copy-paste.  So far these robots look more like tanks (yes, there is a gun there, shooting plastic balls with compressed CO2).  But the functionality there is already laid nehily, the platform is now being actively developed, but not enough hands.  So, I hope, soon they will not only shoot and their lights will blink. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f3d7c674/4c9bbfc9/631e7843/537d2399.jpg"><br><br>  TTX platform (taken from the site) <br><br>  <b>Now:</b> <br>  The speed of movement is 6 km / h; <br>  Bullet (plastic ball) departure speed of 120 m / s; <br>  First-person view; <br>  Operating time without recharging 4 hours; <br>  The weight of the robot is 6 kg; <br>  Robots are equipped with sensors hitting them bullets (ball).  When hit by a wounded robot, it paralyzes for a few seconds. <br>  Joystick control; <br>  Each robot is equipped with laser guidance. <br><br>  <b>Further:</b> <br>  On the robots will be installed night vision systems; <br>  Appearance transformation will constantly occur.  The ultimate goal, walking fighting robots; <br>  Microphones and speakers will be installed on the robots so that robots with the help of players can communicate with each other right on the battlefield; <br>  Controls the guidance of the weapon by using head movements with the help of gyroscopes in virtual glasses; <br>  Ability to customize weapons and characteristics of the robot, depending on the player's rating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f36ca66b/abb62c0c/966f3fef/b64fc784.jpg"><br><br>  Sobssno why all this writing.  We need people. <br><br>  Authors of these devices are open for collaboration.  At the roboforum, basically, one criticism (not always healthy), the proposals are essentially quite small.  And the big-headed and handy people are required to invent new pieces and to implement them in the iron / plastic / electronics.  The authors have their own mini-production, there is a machine for laser cutting.  So it‚Äôs enough to realize the idea in any 3D modeling program - they will make it robotic.  Personal presence is not required - all actions are perfectly coordinated through our favorite Internet.  If suddenly you can offer something (on the case) and want to take part in further development - write in comments, in person, on the official website (I will give at the end of the topic).  Business proposals are very necessary.  In addition, developers will lay out complete recipes for the manufacture of these robots, as the development of a particular stage is completed.  A kind of nehily Open Source platform work.  Description robots intestines will take a dozen topics in the blog DIY, if not more. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I myself do not live in St. Petersburg, so that living on these beauties with a cannon has not ridden yet.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcooperating with the ‚Äúrobotic‚Äù our <a href="http://mikrogonki.ru/">small but proud team</a> was accepted with a bang, in fact, we are already fruitfully cooperating.  For at least one finger to participate in the realization of their childhood dreams - it's nice.  This will be a separate topic later :-) <br><br>  Now a few videos on the topic: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/I99gGppF8DU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiTonyvuabdw2vlCWGN84TlFnKdcQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bY7BdsXdyFw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiKVH3CesTLKIw2tsyXyumoikYY7w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggwKNHBQ3XY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiAYoRFEVDd78lRHiYGCAZ3cbtjkg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Now a bunch of related links: <br>  Official site - <a href="http://www.robot-war.ru/">http://www.robot-war.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club26364196">Vkontakte community</a> <br>  Live video from the site on which the robots chase, right here - <a href="http://www.g0l.ru/test/robowars/">http://www.g0l.ru/test/robowars</a> This is still a test version, but of the camera site has not yet been laid out.  Cameras are turned on at about 10 am and are cut down by common breakers at 22:00.  One camera is on one of the robots, not always on. <br><br>  Sobssno, since I post the topic closer to midnight, the cameras will be turned off.  But I advise you to look in the morning, to see how the robots are chasing :-) The most littering will be at the weekend, when a crowd of visitors come to the club. <br><br>  In general, for now.  If you suddenly become interested - write letters.  Well, or comments. <br><br>  One of the main developers now is on Habr√© - <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/dmitrycyberzone/" class="user_link">dmitrycyberzone</a> <br><br>  PS If someone suddenly can give one invite, it would be nice, because the second author of the subject on Habr√© is not yet.  And on Habr√©, much-needed people with hands from where it is necessary. <br><br>  PPS If anyone remembers, in the comments to my first topic, about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/108058/">controlled camera</a> , people asked to fasten the camera to the riding platform.  Here, the platform is found :-) It remains the case for small. <br><br>  PPS We didn‚Äôt want to announce ahead of time, while still alive we can‚Äôt give it a try, but since we touched on this topic, here‚Äôs a <a href="http://www.g0l.ru/blog/n3005">link to a small note</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124657/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124657/</a></p>
