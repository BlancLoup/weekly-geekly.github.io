      <b>Pros and cons of autonomous development of Internet and mobile projects and solutions in Rambler Digital Solutions.</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúTo use the accumulated experience of the team in one project, we use the‚Äú building blocks ‚Äùthat may be needed when launching other solutions.  The accumulated experience allows us to quickly develop a new product and test ideas offline. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>The</b> average <b>mobile audience share on Rambler &amp; Co resources</b> is 40-42% on average. Today the <b>desktop is no longer relevant - you can read any news in a mobile phone or on a mobile screen.</b>  Due to the fact that the news background is quite active today (current economic and political events), this share will grow. <br><br>  <b>Two main factors of the choice of platform by readers</b> (mobile devices / desktop): socio-demographic indicators of the audience and the characteristics of the resource.  For example, the youth audience is ready to pay for content as entertainment, while the older audience prefers to save time and localize news content in one place. <br><br>  Now there is <b>an active shift of the news audience from the desktop to mobile platforms</b> .  This has become especially noticeable since the Olympic Games and the crisis in Ukraine. <br><br>  <b>Prospects for the development of mobile in large cities and millionaire cities</b> . <br><br>  No revolution in mobile formats will occur yet, at the current moment the speed of the mobile Internet is enough to not feel the lack of broadband Internet. <br>  In the future, even a large uberization is expected in large cities and million-plus cities.  Nowadays, food delivery networks, a unified taxi service, drug delivery, etc. are actively developed ‚Äî all this will penetrate deep into our daily life, because the most expensive currency today is time. <br><br>  <b>Differences in approaches to the monetization of various resources of the group of companies Rambler &amp; Co.</b>  <b>The main directions of mobile monetization.</b> <br><br>  Rambler &amp; Co divides mobile monetization into several parts.  <b>The two main streams for mobile versions are advertising and consumer revenues.</b> <br><br>  Consumer revenues imply paid off of advertising on media resources. <br><br>  In mobile media monetization, there are two main segments of customers. The first is those who built a business in a mobile phone (GetTaxi, Uber, Delivery Club).  It is vital for them to be in the mobile phones of representatives of their audience, so they are willing to pay for the installation of applications through mobile advertising. <br><br>  The second segment is classic advertising clients that use mobile advertising as one of the channels - these are top customers and investors. The specifics of this segment - the lack of a meter - is the biggest problem in the mobile media market.  If the three companies - Yandex.  Rambler &amp; Co, Mail Group - will unite their efforts, they will be able to develop a consolidated market position, which does not yet exist. <br><br>  <b>Tagging and brand-safety.</b> <br><br>  Today‚Äôs news content is negatively colored.  For example, now there are a lot of publications about terrorist attacks in Belgium.  All Rambler &amp; Co content is tagged and brand-safety.  If the client includes a setting to exclude negative content from the campaign, this is excluded technologically based on the tagging that the editorial team does. <br><br>  <b>The impact of the crisis on the media market and advertisers.</b> <br><br>  The crisis has greatly changed the approach to the distribution of advertising budgets, almost all image campaigns were ‚Äúcut off‚Äù at the end of 2013 <br><br>  <b>The launch of the new product Rambler Video in August 2015.</b> <br><br>  Now six streams are launched, which respond to the needs of the Rambler &amp; Co audience: culinary, children's directions, the direction associated with things, and so on.  The holding plans to develop partnership contracts that will allow it to increase the share of content (both foreign and local).  This year will be held under the banner of expanding content topics. <br><br>  <b>The advantage of Rambler Video: the</b> algorithm for selecting content takes place in two stages - machine (by rating and number of views) and editorial.  This allows you to more accurately get into the interests and needs of the audience. <br><br>  <b>New products from Rambler &amp; Co:</b> <br><br>  About 15 products are being developed and are being tested in the near future. The main ones are a mobile product from the ‚ÄúChampionship‚Äù brand, dedicated to the gaming industry, and a mobile version of the Poster. <br><br>  For a more detailed version of the interview, see our YouTube channel: <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ftime_continue%3D437%26v%3D1psNnmv_k7A">www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=437&amp;v=1psNnmv_k7A</a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299634/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299634/</a></p>
