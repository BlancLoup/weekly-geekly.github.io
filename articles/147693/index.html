The history of one application</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, dear habrchane. <br>  I want to share with you a small story of a single application. <br>  At once I would like to warn that there are no codes, nothing connected with them, only my impressions of productive paranoia and the history of one application. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How it all began </h4><br>  It is not the first year that I regularly financially feed on freelancing.  Many and you are probably familiar with the situation when vacation times are approaching, and a crisis situation with the number of projects appears on freelance exchanges, and you have to sweat a lot to grab your project. <br>  And of course, at such times, the law of meanness is taken for work.  For example, you went to the store, and at that moment the project was published just according to your profile, and while you are walking, the project has already left.  Surely I'm not the only one who was upset at such moments. <br><br><h4>  In search of a way out </h4><br>  About a year ago, I became the proud owner of an Android device.  And I would be surprised when I didn‚Äôt find freelance exchanges monitoring applications in the Google Market. <br><br><h5>  Easy retreat </h5><br>  I would like to immediately warn you, as a freelance exchange I mostly use free-lance.ru 
      <br>

    <h5>  CONTINUE </h5><br>  And since the acquisition of the Android device, the idea to write an application for this platform for monitoring free-lance.ru has not left me.  Idea idea, but his hands still did not reach. <br><br><h5>  Hello again </h5><br>  The ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù holiday season has arrived.  Orders on my profile on the stock exchange became much less, free time appeared, and the idea did not get out of my head. <br>  I decided to start learning the basics of programming for Android. <br>  After a couple of weeks of smoking literature in this area, the application still began to be written.  And in the end, I was so interested in writing it, that for a couple of weeks I gave up working on freelancing. <br><br><h5>  and again CLAUSE </h5><br>  I would like to make a reservation, the application was originally developed only by itself, and only on the eve of the publication of the application on <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D357813">w3bsit3-dns.com.ru</a> I saw the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/147039/">article</a> and decided to tie a couple of banners to my application. <br><br>  And now, after 3 weeks, the first prototype of the application was finally ready.  Immediately there was a desire to experience it in battle.  I installed the application to my device, and the top three friends, in order to drive it on different devices. <br>  What was my surprise that the fragmentation of the interface on different devices, with different screen resolutions, and different versions of the platform is practically absent.  From the heat, I thought that ‚Äúthe first pancake is lumpy‚Äù is not about this application. <br><br>  Then one of my friends who was also driving and rejoicing at the application suddenly asked me a cancer question: <br>  - Whether users will be afraid to enter the login / password into another's application? <br><br>  Then I dismissed this issue, arguing that I have an account with a certain rating on free-lance.ru, and when illegal activities are detected, my account is cranked. <br><br><h4>  Why do you need to enter your login / password in the application? </h4><br>  Before writing the application, I thought for a long time how to approach the receipt of information about projects and messages. <br>  Parsing the site itself was a very resource-intensive task, because if the program implemented a filter, then for each filter it would be necessary to load the page or the rss channel and disassemble it.  Well, this is a very costly thing for both the network and the piece of iron. <br><br>  Then I remembered the official desktop application <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/promo/freetray/">FreeTray</a> and decided to see where and in what format the data is obtained, because there also has a filter.  I put the sniffer and passed through it all the traffic of the program. <br>  On a miracle, I found that the application uses some kind of internal XML API freelance.  The request to the administration to provide at least some information on this API did not give any results. <br>  I started to drip into the data being sent and received, and I installed my application to this API and everything works pretty fast. All projects come from the server strictly according to the specified filter and 1 request.  But there is one BUT: API requires user authorization to get a list of projects, messages and contacts. <br><br><h5>  What does the application ultimately do? </h5><br>  Today, the application can: <br><br>  - Download projects, as for a given filter, and when the filter is disabled <br>  -Download freelance contacts from your account <br>  -Download all messages, as well as new ones <br>  -Inform you about received projects and messages <br><br>  In general, I tried to maximize the functionality of the desktop <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/promo/freetray/">FreeTray</a> application. <br><br><h5>  What was the reaction of the freelancers to this APP? </h5><br>  As I wrote above, I published the application on <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D357813">w3bsit3-dns.com.ru</a> and wrote about it on a blog in freelancing. <br><br>  In lichku I got a lot of admiration, which as one combined with sound paranoia.  Almost everyone who wrote to me in a personal talk about their fear of entering a login / password into someone else's program.  Due to the same paranoia that the idea is taken away, I did not post the source code, but I recommended to people that they can see what data are sent to the sniffer, or to monitor freelance on the road, they can open the left account, and calmly monitor without fear, that they will steal data. <br><br><h5>  And what is the result? </h5><br>  I posted the app on July 9th, and only 8 people downloaded it, apparently this is also paranoia.  But I did not count on the boom of races, because I made the application for my convenience. <br><br>  The Habrasoobshchestvo advised me to contact the freelancing administration to get a resolution on the application.  I did so, sent them the source code and the finished apk, but in response received the following: <br><br> <code>,  ,            .     -       .     ,         -     .  ,   <br>    Free-lance.ru</code> <br> <br>  I didn‚Äôt count on anything more, and didn‚Äôt particularly persist, because I did it for myself, but who needs it will overcome its fear. <br><br><h5>  Why is this topic on HABRA? </h5><br>  And to the fact that the scale of fear of people is striking, because of which they neglect the convenience of work. <br><br>  The moral of this story is: if you suddenly plan to create a budget application for a third-party service, think about whether potential customers and users will trust this application ?! <br><br>  <b>PS I would like to hear the opinion of habra people about this paranoia.</b>  <b>Maybe someone had experience in overcoming this obstacle?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147693/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147693/</a></p>
