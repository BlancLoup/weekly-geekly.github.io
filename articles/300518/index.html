Publishing in the media?  Special project?  And there is video advertising, it is also native.  Is Facebook advertising native? <br><br>  Native advertising has 100,500 synonyms: sponsored content, special project, promotional material and all the same in English. <br><hr><br><h2>  Native advertising is when a user has a convenient and interesting contact with a brand.  What kind of advertising depends on the goals. </h2><br><hr>

      Therefore, to start making native advertising ... <br><br><br><h2>  <b>Decide on goals</b> </h2><br>  Why do you need advertising?  Does she solve a business problem?  For example, gain customer confidence or increase sales. <br><br>  Or are you driven by a sense of beauty and a desire for outreach, sherov and general fun, in the center of which is your brand?  The goal defines the format in which you will work. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><h2>  <b>Content depends on the task</b> </h2><br>  You can answer questions that bother people.  Because your business needs a high level of trust. <br>  So did the Qlean cleaning service in a <a href="https://vc.ru/p/qlean-test">publication on VC.ru.</a> <br>  You can make a selection of gifts for the New Year and generate sales. <br>  So did the <a href="http://lifehacker.ru/2014/12/25/30-podarkov-na-novyj-god/">Expedition on Lifehacker</a> . <br>  You can do the <a href="https://meduza.io/feature/2015/06/17/znaete-li-vy-geografiyu-rossii">test</a> , like McDonald's on Medusa, because you have a big well-known brand, and you have to show it from the new side so that you don‚Äôt get stuck. <br>  You can educate young people and raise customers, as <a href="http://journal.tinkoff.ru/30/">Tinkoff does</a> . <br><br>  Choose.  There are many options. <br><br><br><h2>  <b>Who is the audience?</b> </h2><br>  Sounds like the most trivial question in the world.  Every business knows for whom it works.  But when the task arises to be ‚Äúin the reader's world‚Äù to communicate with the client in the same language, you begin to understand the heterogeneous audience. <br><br>  You sell blenders.  They are bought and hipsters for smoothies, and grandmothers for pies.  Communicating with grandmothers and hipsters in the same language at the same time is impossible.  It turns out that some part of the audience will not understand you. <br><br>  This is how this task was solved by the Marriott hotel chain. <br><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6eb/468/656/6eb46865693825a28832a3f359a5ede5.png" alt="circle (22)" width="105" height="105"><br>  <em>David Beebe</em> <br>  <em>Vice president of Marriott</em> <br><br>  There are many points of view on working with the target audience.  And this diversity can be very confusing. <br><br>  Before creating content, we set a goal: "Let's determine the most profitable client."  We spent a lot of time on the segmentation to identify the most profitable group.  It was a fundamental study, during which many aspects were taken into account.  When we solved this equation, the result was simple.  There were one or two attractive groups.  We know who they are, and now they are our starting point, a benchmark for what we are doing. <br><br>  I have always been sure, especially when it comes to working with complex global companies, that any brand, in any country, has a customer or guest who brings him more profit than everyone else.  Marketers need to clearly know who he is.  And then you can do what you want. <br><hr><br><br><br><h2>  <strong>If you have correctly defined the goal, the type of content and the audience, the native advertising works super cool</strong> </h2><br><br>  <strong>Case</strong> <br>  <a href="http://urjanet.com/">Urjanet</a> helps large enterprises use energy wisely.  For example, it makes the car factory spend less money on electricity.  To do this, it analyzes large data on energy consumption throughout the United States. <br><br>  The company has set a goal to increase the number of customers.  The problem of sales was that the technology is complex, and the owner of the plant will not buy the cat in the bag. <br><br>  So the <a href="http://urjanet.com/blog">Urjanet blog appeared</a> .  Here the company tells how using data analysis to reduce the level of energy consumption in various industries: from telecommunication companies to residential areas.  She publishes case studies with partners and interviews with professionals. <br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  6 months after the creation of the blog, the number of contacts with potential customers increased 3.3 times.  The number of leads increased 7 times. </h2><br><br><hr><br><br>  Purpose, format, audience - determine them correctly and the content will work. <br><br><br><h2>  <b>Where to advertise?</b> </h2><br>  There are so many sites.  Starting with your own blog, ending with the media.  It all depends on money, the complexity of the content (text or game) and other factors. <br><br>  In the media, you get a ready-made infrastructure, a creative team, a piece of reader confidence that the platform has formed around you, weekly, but guaranteed traffic. <br><br><h3>  <b>From media native advertising in Runet do:</b> </h3><br>  <a href="https://meduza.io/">meduza.io</a> <br>  <a href="http://bigpicture.ru/">http://bigpicture.ru/</a> (We talked with the founders Sergey Baryshnikov and Alexander Kuksa about how BigPicture.ru makes native advertising.
