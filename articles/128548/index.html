      Who cares please under the cat‚Ä¶ <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started back in the 1999th year.  Then I was only on the 4th year at the Chisinau Polytechnic University.  Studying was easy, programming was more, I worked gradually as a laboratory assistant at the Department of Automatics and Computer Science, because of this there was free access to two classes with computers, where they spent many nights with fellow Duke Nukem.  In January 1999, he married, so much time at the department could not be spent, it was necessary to support a family.  On the advice of my wife I start looking for work.  Oddly enough I found it very quickly, I started teaching C ++ / C ++ Builder to adults.  And here I could not understand everything, for what they, who are already over 25 (they were certainly younger, but mostly everything after 25) need C ++.  I began to investigate this question and it turned out that everyone is learning C ++ because in the states he is very interested and everyone wants to go there either through relatives or by a green card.  After that, I felt somehow uncomfortable, that is, they don‚Äôt have any experience and want to leave, but I didn‚Äôt even know about it, at first I even envied, but then somehow everything grew together, I got used to this idea and more did not bother. <br><br>  After 4 months of work as a teacher, one of the students asks if I want to change jobs and go to the cardboard factory and work there as a programmer.  Salary offered is not small, I immediately agreed.  Of course, it was not possible to simply work as a programmer there, I had to pull the network cable, set up the accounting department, change the wallpaper on computers, etc.  But there was one plus, there was free access to the Internet and sometimes free time when I managed to search for vacancies and send out resumes.  It was at this stage that the upheaval of events occurred, which I don‚Äôt remember, it turns out that I sent my resume to a certain company and forgot about it, but it was she who later appeared on the horizon and changed my whole life, but so far I didn‚Äôt know and just did your business <br><br>  After passing the diploma in May of 2000, one of the friends who graduated a year earlier, the same department asks if I don‚Äôt want to switch to another company more seriously and say roughly the salary from which I almost fell.  For any case, I go to the factory and say that I want to leave.  Everyone panicked at once - What?  Why?  Maybe something does not like, etc.  Well, I said that they say this way and that, I want more salary and named the amount, after which the director turned pale and said that even the deputy director doesn‚Äôt receive that amount, so what do I do, write a letter of resignation and leave for another company. <br><br>  It turned out not so smooth.  The main client was from England, and for the beginning he came to us to manage the project and explain the tasks, and I have English at C ++ level, I have been learning French for 10 years.  It‚Äôs good that I was not the only one, and the company organized English courses for us.  There was little sense from this, BUT after 2 weeks of work, the same company appears where I sent my resume (Moldovan programmer search company for Slovenia) and says that my resume was chosen and probably in 1-2 months I will go to Slovenia .  To say that I was glad it is to say nothing.  As I was driving back to the hostel where my wife and I lived, I do not even remember.  Just flew on the wings of happiness. <br><br>  We began to think with my wife how to be, since she was already pregnant and in her last year at the polytechnic school.  It was decided that I would go for half a year, save up about $ 5,000 (that‚Äôs how much the apartments in Chisinau were worth in 2000), come back, buy an apartment and live on together happily.  Immediately enter English courses. <br><br>  After that, it remains to wait for the very day when I will be called and I will go to Slovenia.  At this time, a son is born, and a month later a recruiter calls me, but an in-person interview.  Everything went smoothly, no questions were asked about C ++ and SQL, they just asked if I knew well and everything.  I am still amazed at this confidence. <br><br>  A month later, I was already in Slovenia, the chef turned out to be a great person, showed the company, gave me time to learn, and then ordered me to do a certain task and merge with the team.  Everything went exactly as my wife and I conceived.  Since I did not know Slovenian, I continued to learn English, this helped a lot in the future.  After six months, I say that the boss, that I have to go back, after which he almost dumbfounded, ‚ÄúWhat?  Nothing of the kind, I want you to stay, and we will bring the whole family here. ‚Äù  Honestly, I did not expect this, then I heard that there were rumors about me that I was ‚Äúan abnormal Russian who knows everything and can do everything that is needed very quickly.‚Äù  I had to call home and talk to my wife, how to proceed.  We decide that they will come here with their son too.  After 2 months we are all going together on the first purchased car (yeah, instead of an apartment?) Back to Slovenia.  But there was little happiness; there was practically no salary left after spending.  So we lived about a year, after which the wages were increased, but still not enough.  It is necessary to do something, and just one of my friends tells me about the site <a href="http://rentacoder.com/">rentacoder.com</a> and how he earns there.  The decision was taken automatically, and I'm starting to earn some money on this site.  At first I took any projects, almost for a penny, I created an image.  After six months, I have already filtered projects at a cost and began to earn more than my main job.  People at the company began to suspect something was not right, my style of clothes changed, I changed the 3rd car, something was wrong here. <br><br>  And here I find again some project for one American.  Nothing so strange, a project like everyone else.  After a month of work on it, they ask me if I want to move to America, become a partner and work for myself with them.  Again, not the expected turn of events, and again just when it is necessary, because someone at the company found my profile on rentacoder-e and questions started. <br><br>  I turn to serious negotiations with the Americans, and make the first attempt to get a tourist visa for the whole family, it was in January 2006.  We fly to Moldova to the American embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãwhere we are refused after the interview.  The American is very angry and says that he will begin to issue a work visa.  Somewhere in early October, I receive a letter from an American that his lawyer has obtained a work permit for me.  I take a vacation, pack all things and go back to Moldova, go through interviews and get a work visa for me and an accompanying family member.  On October 26, we are already in Arizona, where I am working diligently on a project with the Americans.  After 6 months, when the project is almost ready to start selling, while none of us had any experience selling.  Sales did not go, there was no money in the company, did not receive salaries, it was good that there were some savings from Slovenia.  In January 2008, the company falls apart, after which the choice is either to go back to Moldova or look for another job here.  I contact another American, with whom I also worked through rentacoder, he gladly takes me to his place where I work today.  Life has improved, my son is engaged in professional tennis, I also practice a little. <br><br>  I work at home, a free schedule, the main projects to pass on time.  Parents are once every 2 years.  Wife finishes nurse courses.  This year, my wife won the green lottery, and received a permanent residence.  Otherwise, I would have to wait another 4 years when I receive through an EB-3-based company.  (long story why not EB2) <br><br>  This is how we live together in our own house, which we bought 9 years after the original plan.  Only good relations remained with the Slovenian company, that conflict of interests was settled, and after that everything fell into place when we go to Europe, always visit the boss and other friends who remained there. <br><br>  The advice of young people, you work efficiently and quickly, the time will come to notice you and then everyone, including you, will be fine. <br><br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128548/</a></p>
