  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How the application after localization has risen from 40 to 5 place in Google Play</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is known that the localization of the interface increases the popularity of the mobile application in the region and the lifetime value of the user.  And the translation of the description and keywords on the product page in the store has a positive effect on the number of downloads and sales of the application.  But how significant is this influence? <br><br>  Now we know the answer: as soon as we translated the interface and description of the Home Bookkeeping application into Spanish, French and German, its positions on the Google Play top of Spain, France and Germany began to grow rapidly.  It was a rare case when our client did not conduct parallel advertising campaigns.  Thanks to this, we were able to see that the growth of positions is due only to the release of the localized version of the application. <br><br>  Figures, details and the offer to participate in abrupt experiment - under a cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, before localization, the rating of ‚ÄúHome Accounting‚Äù among paid applications in the ‚ÄúFinance‚Äù section was as follows: <br>  Spain - 40 place <br>  France - 46 place <br>  Germany - 53rd place

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f2/71e/483/8f271e483aac464985982946f9054f14.jpg"><br><br>  It took only 10 days after the release of localized versions, and the statistics has changed significantly.  Particularly impressive is the sharp rise in ratings in Spain and France: <br>  Spain - 7th place (+33 positions) <br>  France - 11th place (+35 positions) <br>  Germany - 43 place (+10 positions) <br><br>  The growth of downloads continued in the future.  Obviously, one can speak not of a short-term effect, but of a stable improvement in the rating: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9d/a5a/750/e9da5a7506274c8c92af81f66c9cbd05.jpg"><br><br>  It is seen that in Spain and France, "Home Accounting" is included in the top five paid applications in the "Finance".  In Germany, everything is not so good (I wonder what the reasons are), but here you can see a rise from 40+ to about 20th position. <br><br>  Again, this result was achieved only by translating the application interface, its description on Google Play and downloading updated screenshots in Spanish, French and German.  Not a cent was spent on advertising.  One can imagine what results can really be achieved if we combine localization and competent promotion in the local market. <br><br><h4>  PS Alconost Experiment </h4><br>  By the way, this achievement inspired us to experiment: we want to find out how the localization of the application page on the market affects sales, downloads and rating. <br><br>  We offer every mobile application developer to participate: we are ready to <b>free</b> (well, actually, in exchange for statistics of downloads, purchases and ratings ‚Äúbefore and after‚Äù) <b>to translate the description and keywords for the page of your application in Google Play and / or the App Store</b> from English on any of <a href="http://alconost.com/service/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dcase_kozlovsky">our list of 40+ languages</a> . <br><br>  Only native speakers translate, so you can be calm for quality. <br>  Details - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/244847/">in this post</a> .
