The emergence of these innovations will be possible through the combination of cloud computing, big data analytics, learning technologies, and security tools.  New technologies will be available to consumers, residents of cities, students and schoolchildren, as well as hospital patients. <br><br>  ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs generation has much more knowledge than any of the previous ones.  However, we are still struggling with the influx of vast amounts of disparate information, trying to highlight the most important data arrays that come to us faster and faster, - said Dr. Dario Gil, head of Cognitive Experience Lab, IBM.  ‚ÄúBy creating a technology that will fundamentally change the process of acquiring knowledge, we will move on to the next stage of progress, both in individual cases and in the community.‚Äù

      The ‚ÄúIBM 5 in 5‚Äù forecast is based on market trends and social processes, as well as the development of IBM research laboratories around the world that will help make these innovations real in the next five years. <br><br><h4>  The classroom will help in learning. </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hTA5GyWamR0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgzPBUYa1HTAd_9u1b24XTPYRa-wA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Insufficient education is one of the global problems of the world.  It is estimated that two out of three people in the world did not even receive equivalent equivalent high school education.  What if people have the opportunity to go through all the educational levels and master the skills necessary for a successful life. <br><br>  The classroom of the future will provide education workers with the opportunity to know each student personally and create an individualized schedule for them for all levels of education - from kindergarten to university.  In the next five years, teachers will have access to information on all test results, attendance and behavior on the online training platforms for each student.  Complicated cloud analytics will give teachers an understanding of which student can fall behind and what difficulties they have.  The system will also be able to offer each student concrete steps to overcome these difficulties. <br><br><h4>  Shopping in stores will win online sales </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKNSOwLcrkE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjvBa-WOykvj3wES0rLVNDkHz8ecw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In 2012, global online sales exceeded $ 1 trillion, and are now showing greater growth than retail sales. <br><br>  The advantage of online stores is that they can study the behavior of customers online.  In turn, traditional stores are limited to the data that they can receive as a result of personal interaction with customers.  Today, many online stores open their showrooms, and competition is becoming even tougher - now it is based only on price. <br><br>  In the next five years, new technologies will return to the stores former popularity.  Entrepreneurial sellers will take advantage of shopping at physical points of sale and their proximity to the customer to create a consumer experience that cannot be repeated in an online store.  In stores, shoppers can physically ‚Äútouch‚Äù the digital world.  Technologies like the Watson supercomputer will allow sales consultants to become experts on all products presented in the sales area.  Augmented reality and the recently announced open cloud platform for developers Watson will offer customers a new format of shopping in the store.  Thanks to the growing spread of mobile devices and cloud analytics, consumers will share information such as health, nutrition, and social contacts.  Store owners will be able to accurately predict what products their customers will want to buy.  As a result, physical sales points will turn into spaces that adapt to each visitor. <br><br>  And thanks to the large number of points of sale, which are within walking distance from the buyer, the stores will be able to offer their customers fast and convenient ways of self-delivery or delivery - waiting for a purchase from an online store for two days will seem unnecessarily long. <br><br><h5>  Doctors will offer treatment options tailored to the particular person‚Äôs DNA. </h5><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0M1DMdc1mQ0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjyh_9pW02YCZoLPzTya99lLURKnA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Despite the great progress in research and treatment methods, the number of reported cases of cancer has increased by more than 10% since 2008.  The disease affects 14 million people annually and takes the lives of 8.1 million worldwide. <br>  Imagine that treatment could be more individualized and accurate, and computers could help doctors evaluate how a cancer affects the patient's body at the genetic level, and suggest the best treatment option. <br><br>  Over the next five years, the development of big data analytics and cloud cognitive systems, along with discoveries in the field of genomic research, will help doctors correctly diagnose cancer and create personalized disease treatment plans for millions of patients around the world.  Smart systems will analyze the complete decoding of the patient's genome and extensive archives of medical records and publications on the subject, in order to provide oncologists with specific treatment methods. <br><br>  Cancer treatment based on genome analysis has been seen as a promising method since scientists have deciphered the human genome, but only a few doctors had the opportunity to diagnose and treat a patient at this level.  Within five years, cloud cognitive systems can make such personalized treatment available to patients around the world. <br><br>  IBM is already starting to work in this direction.  The corporation works with health partners to develop systems that can provide the results of the analysis of the human genome and reduce the time required to select the correct treatment for a patient from weeks and months to days and minutes. <br><br>  Over time, these systems will become smarter and smarter.  They will collect information about the genome and the patients' reactions to the prescribed treatment and will offer options tailored to the particular DNA of a particular person.  Through the cloud, information will be available to healthcare organizations around the world, making medical assistance available to more people. <br><br><h4>  Digital Guard will protect us online </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/al8ng82nRss%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhirF-7dBpQmOjSUIeti4LEKI9km4Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Today, each of us has a lot of accounts and mobile devices, but security systems in most cases are fragmented, and personal data is somehow vulnerable.  In 2012, more than 12 million people in the United States were affected by fraud.  Traditional user security tools ‚Äî passwords, antiviruses, and firewalls ‚Äî do not provide comprehensive protection against intruders.  These tools are not effective enough for certain reasons: they recognize only known types of viruses or fraudulent activities and usually analyze only one specific source of information. <br><br>  After five years, each of us may have a personal ‚Äúdigital guard‚Äù who will protect the devices entrusted to him, preventing the theft of personal data.  The security system will compare contextual, situational and historical data to authenticate the user across devices.  Accumulating information about users, the ‚Äúdigital guard‚Äù will be able to distinguish daily activity from suspicious and act as an adviser. <br><br>  Currently, IBM scientists use computer-aided learning technologies to understand how mobile devices behave on the network in order to further assess the potential risk.  In the future, security systems will become more flexible and context-sensitive, with a complete picture of data, devices and applications, and ready to curb suspicious activity in order to avoid identity theft. <br><br><h4>  The city will help its residents </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVGviMIMjN0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgY_uUBSUV4NKO5CWuEAhqOTsJDFw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  By 2030, 80% of the world's population will live in cities in developing countries, and by 2050, seven out of ten people will become city dwellers. <br><br>  In five years, intelligent cities will learn to evaluate billions of processes in real time, as computers will learn to understand the needs, desires, activities, and even ways of moving people. <br><br>  In the near future, cities and city authorities will learn to understand and systematize new information coming from residents.  They will clearly understand what resources need to be allocated, as well as when and where they need to be used so that the city can adapt to the needs of citizens. <br><br>  Mobile devices and social networks will allow residents to establish direct interaction with the city authorities.  This concept has already been developed in Brazil, where IBM researchers are working to create a crowdsourcing platform that will allow citizens to draw the attention of the administration to the lack of the necessary infrastructure for people with disabilities.  At the same time, in Uganda, IBM is working with UNICEF to develop a social tool that helps young people report on issues of concern to local government and members of the public. <br><br>  Such platforms will be used by administrations everywhere to understand the key problems of the city and make urgent decisions. <br><br>  For more information on ‚ÄúIBM 5 in 5‚Äù, see the links below: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.ibm.com/5in5">IBM Research</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://asmarterplanet.com/blog/2013/12/ibms-5-5-future-computers-will-learn.html">IBM Smarter Planet blog</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ibm_research_zurich/sets/72157638595630925/">Flickr</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://ibmblr.tumblr.com/">IBMblr</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206780/</a></p>
