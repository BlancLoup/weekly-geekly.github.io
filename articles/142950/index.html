  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We are a programmer abroad</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How often did you think about employment abroad, whether it is just a temporary job or moving to a permanent place of residence?  Which country to choose?  Is it possible to pass interviews thousands of kilometers by phone and get a job offer?  How will moving and living in another country look like?  In this article I would like to share the personal experience and experience of many of my friends working abroad. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Motivation </h4><br>  What motivates you to find a job abroad?  I think all the answers can be divided into two categories - professional experience and a change of environment / living conditions.  You can take part in interesting projects, touch modern technologies.  You can also try on a slightly different way of life, experience cultural and social differences. <br><br><h4>  Minimum system requirements </h4><br>  There are the necessary minimum requirements - the presence of a diploma of higher education not lower than a bachelor‚Äôs degree and work experience from three years  These requirements do not even come from the employers themselves, but from the procedure for obtaining a work permit for foreign specialists.  Sometimes having a lot of experience (for the USA for example 12 years) corresponds to the level of university education or the sum of years of education after high school and the sum of years of work experience together give the equivalent of education, but all this is more exotic.

      Also a necessary but not sufficient condition is the knowledge of a foreign language, the language spoken in that country or English as a universal language.  A spoken language is required first of all because you have to communicate with colleagues, also communicate in real life, in a shop, in a bank, rent an apartment, etc.  Secondly, the written language is also important because the communication also takes place via email, you will be required to write documentation, and just comments inside the source code of the program. <br><br>  For non-IT positions, a diploma is likely to be required (diploma evaluation, comparison with the local education system), as well as various professional certifications.  If you are just an engineer, the procedure is much more complicated than for a programmer, but solvable.  For such professions as a doctor, a teacher, and so on. He doesn‚Äôt decide in any way; you need to get a local education or not work in a specialty.  This is a small distraction from the topic here in order to show how lucky the programmers are, they can work with the Russian Federation diploma almost immediately and in any country. <br><br>  Do not forget about the availability of the most necessary documents, such as a passport (valid for a period longer than the contract or say more than a year).  The diploma will most likely have to be translated and certified, and in some cases put on an apostille.  Also, if the period for which a visa is issued is more than a specific (from six months or a year), it is likely that they will require to undergo a medical commission in a specialized center (worth the money for you), they may need a certificate of criminal record (for example, if the visa is two years).  Immigration package of documents much more. <br><br><h4>  Which country to choose? </h4><br>  You probably already have some initial information about the country of the ‚Äúdream‚Äù where you would like to go.  This can be inspired by the stories of friends and acquaintances who have already left and settled down successfully.  This can be a childhood dream after reading certain books, watching movies.  If you like French language, French literature, songs like ‚ÄúShanzelise‚Äù and the mere thought of visiting Paris comes to lyrical mood, then apparently you have made your choice.  If you like the German language and the German car industry, then the choice is also obvious.  Someone after studying English at school was determined to go to London. <br><br>  The choice of a country strongly depends on the goal - immigration intentions, i.e.  leave for permanent residence (permanent residence), or just work in a country temporarily.  I would divide all countries into immigration (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) and all the rest.  In the above listed countries, all once arrived: yesterday, a year ago, 15 years ago, parents came or great-great-parents.  The point is that in these countries, visitors are not treated as ‚Äúa lot of people here‚Äù - they will not find fault with your accent, you will eventually be able to take leadership positions and other benefits that are available on a par with ‚Äúlocal‚Äù ones.  The flip side of the medal of such immigration countries is the absence of deep history and centuries of established culture.  To some extent, such a mixture of cultures is even a plus, you can feel as if you live in different countries just by visiting different neighborhoods, eating at ‚Äúnative‚Äù restaurants, attending various social events, in schools children are friends with kids from completely different countries, colors skin and worship.  In the case of countries where there is an indigenous population who has lived for centuries - be prepared for the fact that you are a foreigner in a foreign country, you will never get rid of the accent, you will probably reach the head and you will have three Russians and one local student in your subordination, or the desired the position will take your friend ‚Äúlocal‚Äù maybe with less achievements. <br><br>  If the choice is still not obvious, I would advise you to stick to English-speaking countries or countries where there are large companies in which the working language is English (to some extent).  How much is English?  I think this is the most universal language, for a programmer it is more than obvious, take at least documentation or technical literature, in which language is it most often written? <br><br><h4>  Way of immigration or work / student visa </h4><br>  To come to another country you must have a visa in your passport, for citizens of the Russian Federation even to simply come as a tourist to many countries you need to get a visa.  To come to another country and be able to work there you need a work permit or, more simply, a work visa.  A visa is something that the passport is worth and must be presented to the border guards upon entering the country, it can be a one-time or many one-time issued for a period of time. <br><br>  The term of business and tourist visas from a week to a month.  Student and working done from a month to three.  Immigration - from a year to five (on average 2-3 years).  All these figures are very averaged across different countries, in unusual cases the process is delayed, especially if there are suspicions of immigration intentions, and a working or student visa, or that you are going to work, and you just have a guest visa, or you have changed your name, or you have visited undesirable countries. <br><br>  A business or tourist visa will allow you to enter the country for a certain period (for example, up to 30 days, up to 90 days, up to six months), to get it you need to prove that you have a business meeting (letters from the company) or if it‚Äôs tourism then show paid hotels insurance, in any case, you prove that you are financially independent and that you have something in your homeland, for example, family, work, real estate, etc.  and you are not going to work abroad.  Even if you, for example, are going to work on the side of the customer for two months, you continue to receive a salary in your company in the Russian Federation (plus travel allowance or payment of bills).  If you or your future employer want to cheat and you entered the guest visa and intend to work there, it will be almost a dead-end path, in any case, very hemorrhoid. <br><br>  A student visa will allow you to study in an educational institution and it is possible to work part-time officially, and sometimes it is allowed to work only on campus, i.e.  practically at the university or their intermediaries.  As a foreign student, you will pay many times more for education than if you had a permanent residence, plus of course you need money to rent a house and eat something.  You can partially pay for accommodation with a scholarship from a professor (if you have a budget) and / or part-time work (which is very difficult due to the high workload for study).  If the country is immigration, then you can switch to a permanent residence permit from a student visa and then the tuition fee will be reduced, this can be done in a year or two. <br><br>  A work visa allows you to come and work officially (to earn income), but most likely will be tied to a specific employer, position and city.  In addition to the visa, you will be given a work permit (most likely right at the border), in the future you will extend this permit, which will allow you to stay and work further (but not more than any number of years for some countries).  A work visa is usually done by an employer for you (visa sponsorship), he proves to the state that he could not find such a local specialist, therefore he must bring from overseas, but sometimes the procedure is not so complicated because there is a list of required professions for which there is an exception.  Most often, the employer hires an immigration attorney that costs money (paid by the employer) but allows you to go through the process smoothly.  Arriving on a work visa, you immediately go to work and practically live like a local, you have a salary at the market level (only if you have not contacted any Russian company or recruiter / outsourcer).  Having worked for some time on a work visa, it is easy to do immigration (permanent residence) ‚Äúon the spot‚Äù (if the country is immigration), since  You will already use the category of an experienced specialist and not a general qualified specialist.  The disadvantage of this method is that it is very difficult to find a job.  You will be interviewed by phone (sometimes they pay for the flight and the hotel for onsite interviews) and the company incurs additional costs and risks, you have to be something really interesting for the company.  The second drawback is that you depend too much on the employer, if you have been reduced, or you do not extend the contract or visa, or some other problem has arisen, then you have very little time to find another employer who will remake your work visa for yourself, otherwise, you will have to leave the country, generally feeling that all the time that you are on the suitcases, you buy some things only the most necessary. <br><br>  Immigration is possible only in a limited number of countries (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, something like immigration to the UK, green card lottery to America), only if you do not have roots or relatives in that country.  The immigration process is long and costly and you have to be sure that you definitely need it and it will be necessary in a few years when the process is completed, for example, during this time, your marital status may change, a child will be born.  A big plus of permanent residence is that you are looking for work on the spot, you can work officially and your employer does not need to do anything extra for that.  Not a big deal - you don‚Äôt have a local experience that everyone demands, it‚Äôs a vicious circle.  As a solution, you can go as a volunteer for several months (sometimes they even pay for work) and already with recommendations you can easily arrange further.  Most of them go to Canada, Australia and New Zealand for immigration, but these are mostly family people who have decided to link their fate with the chosen country and have examples of friends or friends who have already left.  By the way, if you are going to go through immigration, I will say right away that there is no need to pay immigration lawyers, all information is on the Internet, they do not speed up the process, but can help reduce the number of iterations if you are wrapped up with incorrectly filled papers, their services are worth say 4 thousand dollars. <br><br>  For some countries, there is a solution when the applicant initiates a work visa, not the employer.  It is good for the state when highly qualified personnel come, they pay taxes and cover the needs of current positions.  There is a problem with a work visa - the entire burden falls on the employer, he proves that he needs a specialist, pays for the costs of the whole procedure and whether the specialist has great risks and how easily he adapts to the new country.  Few employers want to get involved in this complicated procedure, and the specialist himself can usually only go for a complicated and lengthy immigration process.  There is also a problem with immigration - when a person passes by that time, the market will have already changed and maybe such specialists will no longer be in such demand.  Therefore, some countries have programs when the applicant himself proves that he has a good education, work experience, excellent knowledge of the language, the availability of means to come and live in the country for several months, then he arrived on such an intermediate visa a person can undergo interviews on the spot and in in the case of obtaining a job-offer, he receives a work permit without involving the employer himself, if within a specified period (say 9 months) a person has not found a job, he is found on such a visa, then he is forced to leave the country. <br><br><h4>  How to find a job thousands of kilometers away? </h4><br>  First and foremost, you must be unique.  Just an average programmer, tester or admin does not roll, there are always a lot of such in the domestic market.  And you should not shine with knowledge in all areas at once and an alyumy resume like C / C ++, PHP, HTML, VisualBasic, Windows, Linux, namely concentrate on a single technology for, say, 5 years, for example, Linux embedded, Qt Developer , Java J2EE Developer. <br><br>  Second, you must have fluent English (or another) language, usually a telephone interview lasts an hour.  In addition to talking about technical topics, you will always be asked your motivation, why you want to work with them, and also why you want to move to another country, how you plan to move, if you have friends and relatives, who would help you with the adaptation the first time. <br><br>  Third, you must have references, e-mails and phone numbers of your colleagues from the current and sometimes previous works, the list should be from 3-5 people.  These people should speak English (or other) language, preferably neyty.  For example, to work in the United States you will be asked to someone with whom you worked directly in the United States, or your professor, if you studied there.  You can give as a referral your custom if you work out in an outsourcing company?  If this is a problem, then you need to agree with some specific employee on the side of the customer or with a friend living there. <br><br>  How to search for a job?  Use specialized sites, the most popular of them is monster.com, there is a search in different countries.  Get your profile, upload your resume, but don‚Äôt expect automatic suggestions to be sprinkled to you.  Most likely in the first two weeks, recruiters will contact you by email and upon learning that you do not have a work permit, they will simply disappear.  Looking for a job and sending a resume is a job, you have to do it.  Recruiters are most often represented on job sites, they have flooded the market, especially in the UK, they only complicate the process somewhat, adding another link to the chain.  Their positive effect for you is that they will try to sell you as expensive as possible, their fee depends on it, say 10% of the annual salary, also the recruiter will usually know whether the company will issue a visa.  There are also recruiters-outsourcers, they will show you to one or several companies and, having received approval, they will make you a work visa for yourself, you will conduct all negotiations with this recruiter and he will pay you money, but physically you will sit at the customer, and you will not know how much the customer really pays for you, and he will really pay more, because the recruiter must earn on you.  Also, under the contract, you cannot go to work directly to the customer, if you have a very warm relationship, then the recruiter will ask you for some amount to sell you for the last time. <br><br>  Large companies usually carry out many iterations of interviews, for example, for Google this may be 7 or maybe more.  If you are interviewing a large company, be prepared to remember everything from the university course, data structures, algorithms, something from mathematics, they will ask you, give a link to a shared document or a specialized website with syntax highlighting and ask you to write code, ask optimize the algorithm further to use less additional memory, work faster, etc.  During the interview in the office, several people will take turns asking for 4 to write some tasks on the blackboard for 4 or 6 hours.  A large company simply cannot do otherwise. Imagine yourself as a project manager, you need to do the current project and at the same time recruit another three new employees, if you send all resumes from HR to the manager, he will not have enough time just to see them, let alone This is to discuss someone, but he also needs to do the current project.  Therefore, before the project manager, there are filters in the form of several technical interviews simply with the goal of identifying adequacy in basic knowledge.  The applicant may have the impression that such a company needs a monster expert who knows both, but in reality it‚Äôs all filters, in fact it may turn out that the project will be boring and everything that was asked is completely unused.  Also, large companies, especially from the financial sphere, like to send people as an immediate filter to pass tests online, for example, in C ++ or Java, and further if the results are higher than a certain point they will already be interviewed.  Sometimes, as the first filter, the company offers to solve the problem, sometimes they give a limited time, for example, to do it in a few hours or during the day, a task with a catch, some abfuscated code or code containing a potential problem and the question of what the code does and how to fix it, it is possible to rewrite to another programming language if they just need knowledge of several. <br><br><h4>  Information on different countries </h4><br><h5>  America </h5><br>  A regular visa to visit is B-1 / B-2 issued for a year or two, you can come as a tourist (B-2) or business (B-1), for example, to negotiate with a company or maybe you invited to an interview, or even work for several months only you will receive money from a company in your homeland, i.e.  you're just on a business trip.  You can be up to six months in America in one calendar year but not more than 3 months (sort of) at a time, in any case, at the border, the officer will ask you the purpose of the visit, look at all your papers and decide how much you can arrive in the country you have there will be an insert in the passport and it will be stamped to what date you must leave.  For example, they said that you need to attend an exhibition or seminar that lasts a week - well, they will stamp you for a week or with a margin. <br><br>  If you have worked for example in the Russian branch of the American company for more than a year (for example, Intel or some other outsourcer), then the company can easily make you an L-1 visa, this is a business visa, you can work for a year or more in America and get even a salary there . <br><br>  A work visa to America is called H-1B, there are annual quotas that are quickly dismantled (albeit in the crisis year of 2009 there were many of them).  Usually, working visas are easily able to provide large market players, such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others, or outsourcing (recruiters) companies that issue a work visa for themselves and pay you money, but really you work for some kind of customer.  I consider it very rare for a small company to communicate with H-1B, it is very costly and time consuming, and people are needed now. <br><br>  At the moment, getting H-1B is as follows.  Since April 1, new quotas have opened, applications can be submitted, it is expected that there will still be a place by the end of April.  After that, you will have to wait for confirmation (aproval) which will come in August and in October you will be invited for an interview at the embassy where they stamp H-1B, i.e.  having got the job offer now, you can actually work out only from October.  Not many companies are willing to wait for you for so long. <br><br>  H-1B is issued for 6 years, you can extend it for three years immediately and then, and then if you didn‚Äôt apply for a green card, you‚Äôll go back home.  If you like the companies, they initiate receiving a green card for you, while you are waiting for it, you can‚Äôt even go on vacation anywhere, and you can‚Äôt change your employer either (before getting a status adjustment), and generally you can be slightly exploited, but after the green card, you can feel calm and get settled in any company.  Having lived for 5 years, you can get an American passport, although you will be asked to renounce other citizenships, but usually no one does it and America closes its eyes to it or pretends, but if you for some reason are unwelcome it is easy to find a reason. <br><br><h5>  Canada </h5><br>  Almost the same America is just not so fingers curved, with visas easier, but taxes are higher.  Taxes are big because you have to feed two governments, everyone who is on benefits, and there are a lot of them, Canada is a very good country.  As I got the impression, Canada is used as a springboard to America, having received a Canadian passport, you can travel visa-free to almost all countries, and you can work in America on a TN visa that you get at the border by showing a job offer.  You can return to live in Canada in old age, a pension from the state and free medicine.  Job Search Website - <a href="http://monster.ca/">monster.ca</a> <br><br>  Immigration to Canada takes 2‚Äì3 years, it is getting harder and harder to get in, they have entered a list of popular professions, and if you are not on the list, then alas are not needed (unfortunately, as long as there are no programmers on the list, the situation may change).  There is another option for immigration under the Quebec program, but since December 2011 the number of places has been limited and the list of professions has been entered, you must pass the French test to the intermediate level and get the rest of your points with education, work experience, then either the English test or the presence of children who are very much in Quebec ( for they are forced to go to the French school in order to raise real Quebecca).  Having lived in Canada for 3 years (3 years for immigration or 2 years for immigration and 2 or more for working) you can apply for a Canadian passport.  The procedure for obtaining a passport for about a year but recently the process is long and wait for the exam only one and a half years. <br><br>  It is not difficult to get a working visa to Canada if the specialty is in the list of exceptions for a particular province (programs are constantly changing, you will not follow), it takes about 3 months, it also includes passing a medical examination in a specialized center.  If the specialty was not found in the list of exceptions, then it takes several months to obtain a document that the involved specialist will not occupy any space (labor market opinion).  After working for two years in Canada, you can apply for simplified immigration as an experienced specialist, or after working in Quebec for a year as an experienced specialist in Quebec and you can even slip through without French. <br><br>  A lot of young people come on a student visa to Canada, but money is required (parents usually).  ,         ,       ,            ,          . <br><br><h5>  Australia </h5><br> 10     ,       ?     ,  IT       /.    ‚Äî <a href="http://www.seek.com.au/">www.seek.com.au</a> <br><br>      3            5 ,     ,        2012         ,    ,             .    4      ‚Äî    ,             E-3      H-1B. <br><br>              ,   3 ,      - (        ).
