And it is every day!  How many there already navangovat destruction of the world, just the fall of the culture of recruitment - the horror.  But we hold a different opinion and see the real picture with bots, AI, automation and other processes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/952/a7b/25c/952a7b25c9af4549865d1522530d3e5b.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And let's start with a simple example - how much easier was it to communicate after the appearance of the Internet?  or call up thanks to mobile phones?  For some reason, this kind of technology did not contribute to panic. <br><br><h4>  1. Technology reduces running time. <br>  Turns out it's not entirely true </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c30/bfb/132/c30bfb13206646ad92d5fb0faa772a36.gif">

      According to Glassdoor's statistics, the hiring process in 2016 was 23 days compared with 10 days in 2013 (only in the UK the number of days spent on hiring increased from two weeks to four weeks).  This means that they began to spend significantly more time on screening (a lot of testing) - companies are trying to get the maximum amount of information about the candidate to make sure that it is suitable or not.  Well and not to lose the employee in a month, and not to meet the expectations of the person. <br><br>  Technology allows you to speed up the implementation of certain tasks and a detailed approach to the selection process.  The tools create for you a more detailed picture of the recruitment - so that you do not lose sight of anything.  So, the technologies that have been used and done for you are not true. <br><br><h4>  2. Technology does not affect the number of employees (comforting !?) <br>  Influence, but to say "replace", you can not </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/07f/0ee/c94/07f0eec947e84a1db8bc9534cc4c943b.gif"><br><br>  For some companies, the use of technology is simply a vital necessity.  And the transition, of course, is associated with the rejection of the monotonous work that employees perform. <br><br>  At meetings and meetings, we often talk about how we come to the company with a ready solution.  For example.  Here in the company "N" 10 girls regularly reprint the data in the table.  Only doing this 24/7.  And, let's say, we have a solution for such situations (well, we're talking about automation!).  After that, questions arise, they say, and how so?  After all, lost jobs! <br><br>  Don't let that sound very cynical.  Yes, the places disappear, but someone will have the opportunity to perform some more interesting work, and not to engage in routine tasks again and again.  It has always been this way: not everywhere, we still have manual labor and manual work, right?  In this case, no additional value in this and there can not be. <br><br>  But the obvious plus of HR-technologies is that you can give foolish tasks into the hands of bots / platforms / systems, but at the same time open new positions with tasks that can be done only by humans.  And this will help balance the situation: give the routine to the car, finding other directions for the development of the company. <br><br><h4>  3. HR's job is reduced to zero - ‚Äúwe will definitely be replaced!‚Äù <br>  No that's not true </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f4e/00c/fea/f4e00cfead8244fcbe8e3fbe9f8ad5fd.gif"><br><br>  The personnel officers are a thing of the past, but the tough specialists in the field have remained, right?  Now, work with personnel never ends: searching, engaging, adapting, training, developing talents, and then learning and working with a brand! <br><br>  According to a whole <a href="https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/">range of studies, the</a> likelihood that robots will replace the work of HR managers is 0.55%.  So there is nothing to fear. <br><br>  And how can bots bother you at all?  Recruitment will change.  With regard to point positions, the approach will be more and more detailed; with respect to mass positions, there will be more opportunities for taking actions at once with a large number of candidates with minimal human participation. <br><br>  Yes, we expect that the competition for talented specialists will also increase.  So much more knowledge is needed: to know what is happening in the market, what candidates are waiting for, how to retain employees, what to motivate them tomorrow, and what to do with them today.  HR-department has to combine a lot of functions, become a fundamental direction for business.  Become a marketer, learn to consider ROI and own analytics, understand how to look for special specialists, be it a developer, an administrator in an office or another accountant.  Technology comes to the rescue at this very moment, allowing you to fulfill responsibilities and monitor performance in one platform (or several, if necessary). <br><br><h4>  4. Artificial intelligence turn the recruitment upside down <br>  Well, rather talk about it. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5ea/2ba/c0e/5ea2bac0ed724a0e9c3b4cf888da6183.gif"><br><br>  Habrahabr, of course, is not the best place to think about AI, but we will try. <br>  What is AI?  This is a scientific direction (to emphasize "science" several times), based on the modeling of human activity, which is traditionally considered to be intellectual.  AI is a story about the fact that the machine can create something.  This is what was previously considered the prerogative of man.  There are several ‚Äúexamples‚Äù of how AI already affects recruiting and what technology products are currently on the market (Mya, Textio, Pymetrics, etc.).  Why do we have doubts about the fact that AI is actually present in most projects (which claim to be ‚Äúreally use AI‚Äù)? <br><br>  - ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù is a great phrase first of all for product promotion.  But the point is that this inserted ‚ÄúAI‚Äù may not affect the convenience and innovativeness of the service.  Which in itself is somehow strange, agree! <br>  - Mysteriousness!  It surrounds all startups that claim to use artificial intelligence.  All services for recruitment, which are now positioning themselves as AI'shnye, contain some elements, for example, to help in the search or analysis of human needs, skills.  None of them speaks openly and in detail about how the technology works and how it really relates to the concept of AI. <br><br>  So we will follow the development of events and the real signs of AI in recruitment.  Make out something - let us know. <br><br><h4>  5. Technologies are unsafe - we are all being watched, and so there it is! <br>  No it's safe </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c7e/6ff/f3a/c7e6fff3a26f4e5494cc55767e049168.gif"><br><br>  Okay, that is, you are ready to entrust your fingerprints to Apple, but not to switch from the old system installed on your computer?  Amazing  We all use cards for a long time, pay for purchases with a smartphone, and share the details of our personal life on social networks.  Why are you so scared of cloud systems?  Always be interested in the creators of the platforms that you use, where your sacred data is stored, in what country and how well they are protected.  Now everything is pretty strict with 152 FZ, so that all services have to adjust.  And if not, then the answer you will not give any adequate. <br><br><h4>  6. Automation - it's all magic buttons! <br>  And no again </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/633/96e/9fc/63396e9fc2754f3f94d722cf03ef1106.gif"><br><br>  OP!  And the tool itself is looking for candidates. <br>  OP!  The brand of the employer simply sparkles from the attractiveness. <br>  This is not how it works.  Automation is the ability to transfer to the machine (ok, the system) those tasks that you do manually and waste time.  Automation is the rejection of routine functions in favor of intellectual labor.  So if you have never looked for candidates in instant messengers, and you never need it - why do you need a bot in Telegram?  A hundred times to weigh such a decision is necessary. <br><br>  This is such a headache in general - try to keep up with all emerging digital solutions without analyzing the need for their use.  And not understanding why you need, say, a video super superb bot, a new website with a huge animation about a career with a blog, an auto search for Instagram candidates or something else.  "Because the company" Z "already has!" - a bad answer. <br><br><h4>  7. Adapting to a new tool is a painful process with loss of money. <br>  Not </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/077/736/648/0777366481844f4f8f4b617f91cf062d.gif"><br><br>  There are two usually scary moments here: ‚Äúvery long to reconcile‚Äù and ‚Äúdifficult to use‚Äù.  So we will understand. <br><br>  Agreement with some companies is a matter of a couple of letters.  And now they already use the system and storm the market of candidates.  Debugged processes within the company = success in implementing systems.  But all this, of course, depends on the client.  Sometimes coordination takes time and yet in the end it is better to agree once and then just renew the subscription, see how the system grows and develops and enjoy it.  This is a question that needs to be solved once. <br><br>  <i>And to the second dubious myth:</i> yes, we know that some companies are only now moving from ‚Äúfolders on the computer‚Äù to special systems for work.  But this is provided that one tool allows you to reduce the cost of closing a job (remember the case of interrupting information from the tables), increase the efficiency of the team, you can spend time on training.  Again, this is worth the effort and is certainly not an excuse for storing data in Google Docs.  And remember that any system is created for the user: so that you can quickly learn, understand and start working.  Just like when adapting a new employee;) <br><br><h4>  8. Do not target or search, the best source of search is a working site. <br>  No, because this is not an ideal source (like any other)! </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/66a/a9f/d0a/66aa9fd0a5f7411da947e162c605a6d0.gif"><br><br>  Technologies simultaneously made it possible to find an individual approach to each candidate, and allowed to turn to hundreds and thousands of potentially interested. <br><br>  That is why it is now so important to be able to target your message, to look for candidates with very specific characteristics.  Understand the portrait of your audience.  Automated work with a whole range of sources allows you to constantly adjust to changes in the interests of your audience, monitor activity, and formulate requests to your candidates. <br><br>  We conducted an experiment with one company - we offered them not to use the work site for two weeks, to post vacancies on other resources.  So here.  The number of responders has not changed.  The ‚Äúquality‚Äù of candidates has become higher.  And this is logical, because when you are looking for sources of attracting candidates for specific vacancies, you find platforms taking into account the specifics of the position.  This works only with part of the vacancies, but still - it works.  This means it allows to reduce the distance from point A to point B: from you to the candidate with specific experience and skills. <br><br>  So the analytical approach together with the right platform allows us to destroy even the myth that only one type of source brings real results. <br><br>  Willingness to use new tools and learn to set specific goals and objectives within a business is also an area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHR technology to be mastered and mastered. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335288/</a></p>
