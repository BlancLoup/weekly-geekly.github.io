Interesting statistics came out, the largest percentage is 51%, of course, Ukraine, but in second place is Russia - 20%, and in third place is Germany - 17%, and further down: USA - 8%, France - 3 %, England - 1% *.  As for hosting in Germany, most often it is low-cost hosters.  In addition, the site itself is often not developed, but a free template is taken, or an inexpensive template is bought that no one modifies to the needs of the site. <br><br>  Under the cut chart and a couple of thoughts about the relationship between school and IT <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca6/3e5/89c/ca63e589ccd14bb499fa128cd673dafc.png">

      Also, interesting statistics on the registration of domain names of sites of Ukrainian schools.  The domain name and the school number most often appear in the domain name, as the school number is the main identifier. <br><br>  Regarding domain registrars, who registered the domain names.  The leader here is Imena.ua - 51%, nic.ua - 40%. <br><br>  Most of the Ukrainian schools (we are not talking about prestigious and expensive schools) have poorly designed and not informative sites.  What most of IT technologies use now is the parents' monitoring system for assessments: all children‚Äôs assessments are entered into a document available to parents, and when a parent enters the document, he sees his child‚Äôs assessments and homework assigned to him. <br><br>  While not always the leadership of schools willingly goes to meet various information technologies.  Now many schools are close to non-profit organizations, since the structure of our schools has remained since Soviet times, but due to the high cost of infrastructure maintenance and livelihoods of schools, these expenses often fall on parents, for whom spending even 2 schoolchildren in a family is palpable , not to mention if there are more than 3 schoolchildren. <br><br>  In websites, school management does not always see opportunities for growth ‚Äî although it is possible to increase social activity and give rise to many community initiatives, and a school can simply become a place for social initiatives from sitting just behind the desks.  The school is brewed in its own juice, and does not affect (except for financial) the parents of their students. <br><br>  For the development of IT in schools, initiative initiatives are most often needed, and not only funds, there are funds that can do this, but with respect to finding these funds, the school management is rather inert, and besides, even with the introduction of some IT solution, it is necessary these are decisions to support, to which schools often respond with silence. <br><br>  * The data are based on an analysis of 100 sites of Ukrainian schools (08/31/2016). <br><br> <a href="https://www.sim-networks.com/protected-cloud%3Fpid%3D2449%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent%26utm_medium%3Dpostlink"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2e/22e/3bd/c2e22e3bd22c4a0985f83c601d0394f4.png"></a> <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="https://www.sim-networks.com/protected-cloud%3Fpid%3D2449%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent%26utm_medium%3Dpostlink">SIM-CLOUD - Fail-safe cloud in Germany</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.sim-networks.com/dedicated-custom%3Fpid%3D2449%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent%26utm_medium%3Dpostlink">Dedicated servers in reliable data centers in Germany!</a> <br>  Any configuration, quick build and free installation </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309828/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309828/</a></p>
