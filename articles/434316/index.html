Do you want to know what abby Christmas elves look like, what secrets are hidden in the Secret Santa parcels from Australia, how many kilograms of Olivier we ate in one day and how can we diversify the ice skating at -13 degrees?  Then let's go! <br><br>  Under the cut a lot of pictures (~ 5 MB) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ABBYY offices are located in 11 countries of the world, so New Year and Christmas for us are special holidays that help unite global teams from Russia, America, Germany, Ukraine, Japan, Australia and other countries.  We started preparing for the New Year's fairy tale from the beginning of November, when we launched the game ‚ÄúSecret Santa‚Äù in the office.  Until the middle of the month, everyone willing filled out a questionnaire with one question: ‚ÄúWhat do I want to get from Santa?‚Äù.  Warm socks with snowflakes, a Christmas-tree decoration, a book with recipes or a traditional souvenir from Lapland?  You are welcome.  There was only one restriction for fantasy - a gift should be no more than 10 dollars. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c7/tf/ig/c7tfigqy2n_51ivrexamjn8ow-i.png"></div><br>  <i>frame from the movie ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D1%2580%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8_(%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC,_1991)">Frankie and Johnny</a> ‚Äù</i>

      Having collected all the wishes, we found a pair for each participant - from different countries and departments.  So colleagues can get to know each other better.  And then the most interesting thing began - all ABBYY offices turned into real Santa factories.  Until the end of November, we prepared surprises, packaged them beautifully and carried them to our "New Year's Elves."  This is how a whole mountain of surprises looked from Russia, to which our colleague almost climbed: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bl/aj/3q/blaj3qavojgprpu4voyjv83peg4.jpeg"></div><br>  What was asked of the Secret Santa?  14 pairs of Christmas socks, 32 books, 11 mugs, 8 Christmas toys, 8 tabletops, 7 T-shirts.  But many gifts are difficult to attribute to some categories, for example, a trinket ‚ÄúTroika‚Äù, ‚ÄúPikachu‚Äù in any form, something hot and ‚Äúsomething that will make my wife happy‚Äù. <br><br>  In the middle of December the parcels went to their addressees.  For example, here we were not yet sure whether it would be possible to close this suitcase, but we knew for sure that it would fly to Munich: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hx/o_/yo/hxo_yovozk1e3ddw8pzwkgiepa0.jpeg"></div><br>  In general, to be the elf of the Secret Santa is a non-trivial task that requires a lot of time and attention.  For example, part of the gifts was delayed at the customs, and such an item as the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD">harp</a> , the delivery service refused to accept at all.  It turned out to send a musical instrument, you need a cover letter from the Ministry of Culture that it is not an object of cultural value. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fu/95/r4/fu95r4lhnlncgljy8asbzcr78ci.jpeg"></div><br>  <i>‚ÄúHere you set me a task!</i>  <i>To go to the forest, to find this and bring it from the children. ‚Äù</i>  <i>(shot from the cartoon "Snowman-mailer")</i> <br><br>  This year, the secret santas in ABBYY became almost twice as many as in 2017. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xb/cr/dl/xbcrdliag7remcdbw8xpx10tlrc.jpeg"></div><br>  Gifts from other ABBYY offices continue to arrive in Russia.  And sometimes they are very unusual.  For example, a circle with an image of a representative of the local fauna flew from Russia to Sydney.  Here is the Australian <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258B">Kookabarra's anboxing</a> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xv/7u/7r/xv7u7rsn3ita2fn3xyvywe9rypu.jpeg"></div><br>  And Cheburashka went from Moscow to Japan <s>, unfortunately, not in a box with oranges.</s> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uh/1a/rn/uh1arn_h1t-nm8amwplbgad9umo.jpeg"></div><br>  In a group at Workplace, colleagues share photos of their gifts and thank Secret Santas for these magical moments: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ej/fv/wz/ejfvwzk3kyzf_6696dld7mgnvi4.jpeg"></div><br>  In the meantime, the new year was getting closer, and at the beginning of December the halls of ABBYY were decorated with green fluffy spruce trees, garlands of pine cones ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fc/lv/ax/fclvax6unusn8igbftohrsmcbu8.jpeg"></div><br>  ... and the kitchen - with Christmas wreaths.  The festive mood seems to have come! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bn/tm/qz/bntmqzdsbqg0ma7to1cpetbujwg.jpeg"></div><br>  Christmas decorations - for everyone.  You can take a ball or some tinsel to add the spirit of the coming New Year to your workplace.  The main thing is to wait for the winter holidays bright! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ea/ge/4b/eage4bl__cx9uemf64kmwbzqquo.jpeg"></div><br>  ABBYY New Year crept up on December 20 in the morning in the form of breakfast with Russian salad, pancakes, cheesecakes, cocoa and ginger men.  Sorry for the food photo, the author was just hungry, and the food looks too appetizing.  By the way, on this day, the Russian office of ABBYY ate 17 kg of vinaigrette, 81 kg of Olivier, 12 kg of gingerbread and washed down this 102 liters of cocoa. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/gm/a3/nsgma3tdjmrad592fenq5r_qf6m.png"></div><br>  In the kitchens began a cheerful joint eating yummy. <br><br>  <i>And let's raise our cocoa for the new year?</i>  <i>And let's</i> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qr/g7/yv/qrg7yvufrmnlzi5q7umngdbgwh4.jpeg"></div><br>  They ate, you can and ... train your brain!  During the day, connoisseurs of New Year and Christmas films went to the cinema quiz.  They had to recognize the frames from the New Year films and not only.  Attention, dim the lights and start. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vc/uj/zw/vcujzwooqbtw9wtvbiodivsqhq8.jpeg"></div><br>  Forms team, which won first place.  Charged for success. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d3/ik/mu/d3ikmuabgpmrghqm8opp2i_38dy.jpeg"></div><br>  But not everything was easy.  Guess what attribute of the New Year's holiday is encrypted in this rebus? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h1/mj/ur/h1mjuruem6p5eaayp3tuk5xwn80.jpeg"></div><br>  Other colleagues went in search of New Year's mood in the quest for the office, which prepared the magic elf.  He only makes a cute look, and in fact distributes tasks to the <s>hint</s> right-left. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qr/c_/xo/qrc_xod6fkthigl18jai9osaxxk.jpeg"></div><br>  The guys had to complete 6 different tasks - solve puzzles, solve puzzles, practice memory and decipher the Christmas message.  Elven miracles unraveled 160 people. <br><br>  <i>One of the ABBYY teams will soon guess the secret cipher!</i> <i><br></i> <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mr/bv/vo/mrbvvojekthibm3jxba3csjyrkg.jpeg"></div><br>  What can be done with a hammer and yarn?  At creative workshops, colleagues mastered quilling, made pictures from threads or eco-ornaments from natural materials. <br><br>  <i>Photographer, do not distract us.</i>  <i>There is jewelry work!</i> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1j/rl/1d/1jrl1dmadc_dqcx-anwu4w4gxxs.jpeg"></div><br>  Meanwhile, on the 4th floor, festive photo-transformations took place.  Before and after: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/an/lh/ar/anlhar-mr8rkgkvs6ti3ylajje0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  During the day, ABBYY Santa (CEO of the ABBYY Group of Companies Ulf Persson) and ABBYY Moroz (Executive Director of the ABBYY Group of Companies Vadim Tereshchenko) looked in at the office with New Year's gifts.  And handed them to everyone personally! <br><br>  <i>Ulf: ‚ÄúThis year we all worked a lot and deserved gifts!‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p1/iw/xs/p1iwxsy6dv_zvwvi6nlystwogm8.jpeg"></div><br><br>  <i>Lucky-Lucky!</i>  <i>This is only the first cart!</i> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n8/dm/v2/n8dmv22buuqcwptiktyzneaqqxm.jpeg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sc/n5/wp/scn5wpjgcsvxhfzjqq-w9msnvkg.jpeg"></div><br>  What is hidden in the box - look under <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  There are gingerbread cookies with a Mezen painting, a Christmas-tree toy-pig, a painted mug and raspberry jam with mint.  All these are handmade gifts made in charity workshops. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wi/9t/rx/wi9trxj6d8xyze1bego2zqrzwvo.png"></div></div></div><br>  <s>A minute of advertising:</s> By the way, no one will leave without gifts.  For the new year, we give everyone <a href="https://www.abbyy.com/ru-ru/promo/ny19/%3Futm_source%3Dhomepage%26utm_medium%3Dgifbanner%26utm_campaign%3Dny19">50% discount</a> on FineReader, PDF Transformer + and Business Card Reader and our other programs.  And only until December 29th. <br><br>  But back to the holiday, which continued on the rink "At the Arc de Triomphe."  Nearly 400 abby people came out on 5000 square meters of ice. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ci/cu/yr/cicuyront64zi6s8yziwxeb2xna.jpeg"></div><br>  Do you like to ride?  Then go ahead for the snake! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/uh/yo/jyuhyogce-oqzflz2swrblgvnco.jpeg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jz/pl/fp/jzplfpiusmpfmypvibyhe9my9ky.jpeg"></div><br>  Or maybe try to combine ice, mop and brick?  It turns out like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/re/6n/q0/re6nq0rb57mffby9pkmaziqtzwm.jpeg"></div><br><br>  In the meantime, the Australian office of ABBYY also gathered to celebrate the new year and play curling, but on an indoor rink. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/re/vf/12/revf12czdqv4kdnc3lozmrea18m.jpeg"></div><br><br>  And on the New Year's holiday in the Ukrainian office reigned the spirit of the 30s of the last century.  The gangsters were surprisingly gallant, the ladies were elegant, and not a single civilian was injured. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pj/ng/k1/pjngk12srkq31ndsa6o7po6lpcq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Colleagues from Japan celebrate in their own way: they went on a tour of the local winery. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/ek/hs/bhekhs-4ux3rpl4-q3durlnfvfi.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Everyone managed to feel the approach of the new year and share positive emotions with each other.  And in the morning, <s>almost</s> everyone came to the office and continued <s>to</s> work.  But these memories continue to warm us on frosty days.  We hope that we have pleased you on the eve of the New Year! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yo/zp/rp/yozprpoc0lcpzttnzhbbxnziuh4.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Write in the comments, what holiday traditions do you have in offices and at home, how do you implement your ideas and what inspires you? <br><br>  <i>Elizaveta Titarenko, editor of the corporate blog ABBYY</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434316/</a></p>
