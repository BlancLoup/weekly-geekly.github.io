  <section class="page js-page"><h1>YouTube wants independence</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Despite the fact that experts estimate the company YouTube is already at $ 1 billion, this young startup does not show any signs of a possible sale.  Like the founders of Skype at one time, YouTube executives also say that their business is not for sale. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  YouTube co-founder and director Chad Hurley, in his 29 years, has already become a celebrity and potential billionaire.  He <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php%3Fp%3D3382">spoke</a> at the <a href="http://stanfordsummit.goingon.com/permalink/post/866">AlwaysOn</a> conference and discussed the most topical issues that are of interest to the public regarding his company.  As you know, the recent phenomenon of YouTube has attracted widespread attention, and therefore there are various speculations.  There are a lot of questions.  For example, how is the YouTube company going to pay back huge operating expenses, because every day its servers ship 100 million video files to the people for free. <br><br>  Two months ago, even Bill Gates <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/%3Fp%3D3116">commented on the</a> situation around YouTube.  He said it was a great service.  Gates himself enjoys it, he recently found there classic recordings of entertaining basketball shows <a href="http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/start.asp">Harlem Globetrotter</a> .  But at the same time, he said that YouTube company still needs to learn how to make money and solve copyright problems.  In response, Chad Hurley adamantly remarked that Bill Gates was "commenting on our business, and at this time Microsoft was trying to create a clone of our service."  It is not very beautiful.  In general, YouTube‚Äôs goal is to ‚Äúdevelop the next generation platform for delivering digital content around the world.‚Äù <br><br>  Then Chad Hurley was asked if he considered Google Video as a competitor.  The director explained that the YouTube service controls 60% of all video streams on the American Internet.  They have a better product that continues to evolve and improve.  The YouTube company wants to preserve independence and uses venture investments for this.

      With regard to problems with copyright, YouTube seeks to translate its activities into the legal channel.  They recently signed an agreement with NBC (although the story began with NBC's requirements to remove pirated content), and now they are negotiating with other television networks and studios.  For them, YouTube is positioning itself as a powerful advertising platform, not trying to replace TV or movie theaters.  They specialize in broadcasting short videos, rather than transferring files with full-length movies and TV shows. <br><br>  Of course, now the company is in a huge minus.  Business brings only losses, but the young company gradually creates its own advertising platform and recruits its own sales department.  Business model: advertising revenue with banners, sponsorship and contests while maintaining free service.  Standard promotional videos are not yet planned to be incorporated into YouTube content, although some experts say that this is inevitable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4217/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4217/</a></p>
