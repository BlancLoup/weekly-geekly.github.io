  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Father of Bitcoins" Satoshi Nakamoto nominated for the Nobel Prize in Economics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The creator of Bitcoin is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/satoshi-nakamoto-nominated-for-the-nobel-prize-in-economics-1447088488%3F">nominated</a> for the Nobel Prize in Economics for 2016, despite the fact that so far no one knows who he is.  The pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto was used by the creator of this revolutionary financial system, but all attempts to uncover the identity behind him led to nothing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd2/64b/9e0/cd264b9e0eec45a7a83c59588f6ddf57.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Nakamoto was nominated by Bhagavan Choudhury, a professor of economics at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), whom the Nobel Committee proposed to select 2016 nominees.  Bitcoin cryptocurrency technology was first described in detail in the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">official report</a> for 2009, published online under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, entitled ‚ÄúBitcoin: peer-to-peer, electronic monetary system‚Äù. <br><br>  Choudhury described the invention of Bitcoin as a ‚Äúrevolutionary discovery‚Äù, and the underlying technology, blockchain, as the basis for many innovative developments in the field of fintech.

      Choudhury believes that Bitcoin has several advantages over traditional metal and paper money.  The bitcoin system is stable because it is based on a cryptographic code, crypto coins can be divided into millions of small particles and instantly sent to any point in the world where there is Internet, without the participation of governments, central banks and financial intermediaries, such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal or any other commercial banks , which is reflected in the low cost of transactions and its immediate implementation. <br><br>  Previous attempts to establish the identity of Nakamoto did not succeed, but some community representatives are inclined to believe that Nick Sabo, a well-known cryptographer, is hidden under this pseudonym.  Writer and financial analyst Dominic Frisbee, who initiated a five-month investigation into Satoshi‚Äôs identity, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-creator-revealed-satoshi-nakamotos-true-identity-unmasked-1474316">concluded</a> that Sabo is the only candidate who fits the role of creator of the world cryptocurrency. <br><br>  Sabo has consistently denied the arguments of Frisbee, both in person and in public on Twitter.  However, very little is known about Sabo himself, practically nothing besides the information on his personal blog and some scientific publications.  Whether Sabo Satoshi Nakamoto or not, Choudhry believes that the Nobel Prize is unlikely to cause the creator of Bitcoin to reveal its face. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI guess he will not appear in public, given that he preferred anonymity throughout his life, I don‚Äôt think he will change his habit in order to attend the award ceremony, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bhagwan-chowdry/i-shall-happily-accept-th_b_8462028.html%3Fir%3DIndia%26adsSiteOverride%3Din">‚Äù</a> Choudry <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bhagwan-chowdry/i-shall-happily-accept-th_b_8462028.html%3Fir%3DIndia%26adsSiteOverride%3Din">writes</a> .  "I am happy to attend the ceremony instead." <br><br>  The speech of gratitude will not be a problem either, Choudhry believes, since, hypothetically, Satoshi can send his message by e-mail so that Chaudry read it later. <br><br>  G√∂ran K. Hassen, secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, the organization awarding the Nobel Prizes, said in a commentary only that prior to the presentation of the award, the personalities of the nominees were not disclosed. <br><br>  According to Choudhury, when he received an offer to choose a candidate for the Nobel Prize nomination, several names of honored economics appeared in his head: Paul Romer, Doug Diamond, Steve Ross, but then he came to the conclusion that the nominee should be a person made his revolutionary discovery in the 21st century.  ‚ÄúThe name Satoshi Nakamoto immediately came to my mind, and I don‚Äôt know a better candidate,‚Äù said Chaudhry. <br><br>  The fact is that Satoshi Nakamoto never published scientific articles in economic and financial publications.  His only publication is a nine-page Bitcoin report.  One can only assume the surprise of the creepist Satoshi Nakamoto of his nomination in the field of economics.  Perhaps, only Sigmund Freud was also surprised when Romain Rolland chose him as a nominee - in the field of literature. <br><br>  However, according to Choudhury, Nakamoto not only deserves the prize, but awarding him the Nobel Prize can contribute to changing the public perception of money and draw attention to the problems of the traditional financial system.  Thanks to the development of new technology, users will be able to save their resources and consciously manage them, and disadvantaged segments of society will be able to gain access to financial services.  Thus, our efforts aimed at the development of Bitcoin can contribute to the solution of global problems, Choudry believes. <br><br>  "I can not remember any other discoveries in the field of economics over the past decades, comparable in scale to Bitcoin," Choudrey writes. <br><br>  As for the prize money, in the case of the award of Satoshi Nakamoto, Choudhury offers to buy bitcoins with this money and transfer to Satoshi's bitcoin address.  However, Satoshi himself, who owns several hundred million dollars and Bitcoins, is hardly concerned about the money issue. <br><br>  According to another interesting version, there is a possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto is already the winner of one Nobel Prize in the field of economics.  Rumors that under the pseudonym Satoshi <a href="http://fuk.io/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto-the-truth/">hides the</a> famous mathematician John Nash, Nobel Prize winner in the field of economics for 1994, whose story is described in Ron Howard's drama "Mind Games", no one has denied.  John Nash, the author of the Ideal Money concept, died in May 2015. <br><br>  Blog <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/hashflare/blog/265310/">Hashflare</a> will continue to keep you abreast of current events in the world of Bitcoins. <br><br> <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3D265804"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/57f/5f9/eb157f5f90f54032aa2b80b1c2973a73.png" width="400"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368971/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368971/</a></p>
