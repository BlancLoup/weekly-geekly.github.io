Yes, probably, with the right conversation, the probability of its success will be greater, which means there will be more sales.  But there is even more direct dependence. <br><br>  Now we will talk about active cold sales.  Many people use them, and if you do not use them, you still need to think about it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Obviously, a direct way to increase sales is to expand the sales funnel. <br>  The more we make cold calls the more we sell.  This dependence is mathematical and many of you know your own multiplier. <br>  There are two ways to increase the number of calls - by containing more telemarketers or by increasing the effectiveness of existing ones. <br>  <b>Increasing efficiency is always more profitable.</b>  Even if the increase in sales will increase fees - a constant component (salaries, costs for jobs, training, CRM accounts, etc.) will not grow, return on sales will be higher.

      <b>How to create conditions for their sellers to work effectively?</b> <br>  It is necessary to build the right business process in which employees rationally waste their time. <br><br>  <b>First: the</b> work must be planned. <br>  At the beginning of the day, each employee (or the head of the salesperson‚Äôs group) must plan their work for the day, so that they do not get distracted by thinking about what to do next. <br><br>  <b>Secondly,</b> you need to ensure comfortable work without unnecessary distractions. <br>  How we do it with the help of our application, I will try to explain with two pictures: <br>  - the telemarketer enters the interface for working with scripts and displays a list of scheduled tasks (either all assigned calls, or by searching for the name of calls): <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5c/363/2e8/c5c3632e803340a8b1595c6877ea5805.png"></div><br><br>  - selects the first from the list and immediately sees who he is calling, where to call him, what to specifically suggest, what the group leader advises him in the comments: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83b/d1a/84d/83bd1a84dda44a41ba3c3756c79e10be.png"></div><br><br>  - during the conversation, fills in the necessary information in CRM by clicking on the fields inserted in the text, if necessary, immediately goes to the company or contact card, ends the call. <br>  - Selects the next scheduled case and repeats the cycle. <br><br>  Usually the seller does not need to open other elements of the system during calls - all information is exactly where you need at the moment, open CRM cards, look for the right fields, go back to the script, make notes in a notebook and then transfer them to CRM - There is absolutely no need. <br><br>  As a result, we save from 30 to 50 percent of the time of our employee. <br><br>  If we take into account other advantages of working with the system <br><ul><li>  the correctness of the dialogues </li><li>  pre-sale reminders </li><li>  knowledge of answers to any unexpected questions </li></ul>  it becomes obvious that with the right job, we can count on at least 30 percent sales growth. <br><br>  That is why we are pedantically engaged in high-quality tight integration of the application with popular CRM. <br>  Initially, the application was integrated only with Bitrix24 (we use it ourselves in our work). <br>  Most recently, we have completed integration with amoCRM and Megaplan. <br>  All versions can be found on our website <a href="http://callhelp.kit-media.com/">http://callhelp.kit-media.com</a> and test them for free for 15 days. <br>  Subscribe to our news in social networks, and if you have any suggestions or suggestions, be sure to write. <br>  The functionality of the application develops, including taking into account real-life use cases. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294586/</a></p>
