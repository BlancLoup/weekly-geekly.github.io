  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We continue testing: on the queue server Fujitsu PRIMERGY RX2540 M2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi Habr!  In one of the previous blogs <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/fujitsu/blog/320230/">we wrote</a> about the Fujitsu PRIMERGY RX2530 M2 single-rack server, and now it‚Äôs the turn of its older brother - PRIMERGY RX2540 M2.  Testing the server was carried out by experts of the analytical <a href="http://www.itpro.co.uk/">Internet portal IT Pro</a> .  We hope to know your opinion about the product and are ready to answer questions in the comments. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f0/e03/20e/9f0e0320e7e344aab693616e08bffcdb.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Medium-sized companies can start with an entry-level configuration and upgrade the system as they grow.  Fujitsu installs Xeon E5-2600 v4 processors into its servers and offers 21 configuration options so that companies can choose the model according to their budget and workloads. <br><br>  The server supports from 24 SFF drives, the number of which can be increased to 28 using the optional rear compartment.  The server also supports various configuration options ‚Äî a whole set of expansion kits are offered to increase capacity as needed. <br><br><h3>  Specifications </h3><br><ul><li>  Case: 2U, rackmount </li><li>  Processors: 2 processors Xeon E5-2650 v4, 2.2 GHz </li><li>  Memory: 64 GB DDR4 (max. 1.5 TB) </li><li>  Data storage system: 4 HGST SAS SFF drives, 300 GB, 15 thousand rpm (max. 28 drives) </li><li>  RAID: Fujitsu PRAID CP420i, 12 Gb / s, SAS / 2 GB cache </li><li>  Array support: RAID 0, 1, 1E, 10, 5, 50, 6, 60 </li><li>  Network: 4 Gigabit DynamicLOM Cards </li><li>  Expansion options: 6 PCI-e 3.0 slots (max. 8 slots with adapter) </li><li>  Power supply: 2 hot-swappable power supplies (450 W) </li><li>  Management: Fujitsu iRMC S4 </li><li>  Warranty: 3 years, on site, next business day </li></ul><br><h3>  Data storage </h3><br>  The base system is equipped with a 4-port integrated SATA controller, support for stripe and mirror arrays is provided.  The model supports the installation of 4, 8 and 12 drives of 3.5-form factor LFF or 8, 16 and 24 drives of 2.5-form factor SFF.

      The system under test was equipped with 16 SFF drives, the first 8 drives are directly connected to the PRAID EP420i PCI-e SAS3 controller card with 2 GB of cache memory.  In order to use the second group of drives, you need to order an upgrade kit, including a connector panel and a SAS expander, as well as change the connection of the RAID card. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e36/343/4f0/e363434f0a7a46d986cc2884d4e6bea3.jpg"></div><br><br>  The same applies to the case with 24 drives, although it lacks a control panel and 5.25-inch drive.  In any case, the server can be retrofitted on site, since  Fujitsu offers LFF and SFF upgrade kits. <br><br>  An additional compartment for 4 SFF drives is installed on the back above the power supply compartment.  This arrangement does not allow the use of the leftmost PCI-e slot, and the bay must be connected to a dedicated RAID card. <br><br><h3>  Cooling and Advanced Thermal Design (ATD) technology </h3><br>  During testing, it turned out that the fans can operate at minimum speed only at 8000 rpm, which leads to a slightly overestimated noise level of 67 dB.  The server does not support the Fujitsu LNM function (low noise mode), which is available only on older PRIMERGY models. <br><br>  Despite this, ATD technology allowed servers to be certified for operation at an ambient temperature of up to 45 ¬∞ C, which reduces cooling costs.  ATD is a default feature, but what does it do? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c39/030/eec/c39030eecaa34768baf0507628ad336b.png"></div><br><br>  Fujitsu has made changes to the BIOS to adjust the response level of the sensors so that they turn on earlier.  The air flow must flow freely through the housing, therefore ATD technology is only available for systems with 4 LFF or 8 SFF drives.  Other limitations include high TDP processors, GPU cards, internal tape drives and RAID cache modules (flash memory). <br><br><h3>  Control </h3><br>  The embedded iRMC S4 chip has a dedicated gigabit connector and supports a web interface that displays a large amount of information about the main components of the system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03d/986/65a/03d98665aa83450a9e3d79f3f424089e.png"></div><br>  The interface is not as multifunctional as the HPE iLO4, but still quite informative.  Fujitsu plans to time the iRMC update with the release of new Purley processors from Intel. <br><br>  ServerView Suite also requires upgrading, although it provides enough utilities to monitor server performance.  Its update is scheduled for 2017. <br><br><h3>  Data processing and performance </h3><br>  The test system was equipped with 2 Xeon E5-2650 v4 processors (2.2 GHz) and 64 GB DDR4 memory.  The motherboard has 24 DIMM sockets with a maximum memory capacity of 1.5 TB.  Users can increase memory up to 3 TB using LRDIMM memory modules with a capacity of 128 GB each. <br><br>  In the system presented for review, 4 SAS3 SFF drives (300 GB, 15 thousand rpm) and a PRAID EP420i controller were installed.  To reduce costs, you can choose a model with the CP400i or EP400i SAS3 cards.  These cards support RAID5 and 50 arrays, and the latest model of the card has 1 GB of cache memory. <br><br>  The system also has two hot-swappable power supplies (450 W), the more powerful models use the power supplies Platinum (800 W), Titanium and Platinum (1200 W).  Despite the fact that the fans worked a little faster than we would like, the server showed good test results: 119 watts with idle and maximum 282 watts when the processors were loaded at 100%. <br><br>  The server supports up to 8 PCI-e cards with adapters.  In addition, DynamicLOM adapters are provided.  Installed in a proprietary connector on the motherboard, various versions are available: 2/4 Gigabit and dual fiber-optic or copper 10-Gigabit. <br><br><h3>  pros </h3><br>  Excellent value for money and quality;  flexible options for increasing data storage capacity;  powerful processors E5-2600 v4 Xeon;  low power consumption. <br><br><h3>  Minuses </h3><br>  Noisy cooling fans, management software updates will be available only in a few months. <br><br><h3>  Verdict </h3><br>  Fujitsu can rightly be proud of its new dual-bay rack server.  This model not only set 4 world performance records based on SAP, VMmark and TPC-E test results.  The versatility of usage scenarios allows the system to be used to run a wide range of business applications. <br><br>  This model is a profitable investment, because  It is possible to choose the configuration in accordance with the budget and then upgrade the server as needed.  There will be no problems with the storage system capacity either, since  The RX2540 M2 supports upgrade kits that can satisfy most customer needs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321232/</a></p>
