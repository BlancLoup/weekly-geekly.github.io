      The purpose of the conference remains the same - the popularization of technology, but an even more important task is to explain how a multitude of technologies should be correctly used and implemented in our lives.  That is why the theme of the conference was chosen PHYGITAL TRANFORMATION. <br><br><h3>  PHYGITAL TRANSFORMATION </h3><br>  What is Phygital?  For example, these are practically all Microsoft products - which work at the interface of the digital and physical worlds.  Kinect, Hololense, etc.  The concept of Phygital unites a lot of areas of full-scale technology development and the transition of a person to a new stage of interaction with the environment, from entertainment and marketing to research and data visualization. <br><br>  Just in case, we once again remind you that this year the conference will meet guests at the ZIL cultural center in Moscow on September 24. <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="https://mixar.timepad.ru/event/315479/">Link to the mandatory free registration</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://mixar2016.ru/">Conference site</a> <br><br><h3>  Development of AR &amp; VR technologies in Russia </h3><br>  2016 has become an indicator of the pace of development of augmented and virtual reality technologies in Russia.
