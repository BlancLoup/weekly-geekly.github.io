So last week I spoke at the <a href="http://sales.dnbd.su/"><u>Dive In Sales</u></a> business conference in Skolkovo.  The conference is devoted to all sorts of issues in the field of sales - strategy, tactics, tools.  The conference audience was quite diverse - there was a small, medium and large business.  That's probably why it turned out that even though I have more than a decade of sales experience behind me, I learned something and got some interesting ideas.  Here are some of them. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Initially, there was an interesting story told by <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bernerandstafford"><u>Vadim Dozortsev, a</u></a> well-known expert in sales management, about forecasts and sales trends in 2016.  The tendencies are that the time cycle of sales increases, the volume of a single transaction decreases and the market is actively redistributed.  Since we are engaged in the organizational implementation of social portals in my work, I am always interested in ways to involve people in working with new tools.  So, in terms of the implementation of the sales management system, there are three main methods: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ol><li>  Impose CRM system on real business processes; <br><br></li><li>  To train sales managers to work in a new tool; <br><br></li><li>  And only then clearly and consistently make them work there.  Yes, affectionate persuasion is not very work among sellers. <br><br></li></ol><br>  After several sales cycles conducted in the CRM system, managers themselves begin to understand the personal benefits, because they see an improvement in their results.  About social portals, I can say that on the first two points we coincide with the experience of colleagues, and in the third one we have to use more creative tools. <br><br>  By the way, even during his report, Vadim gave examples of companies that have sunk almost twice as much as last year, and companies that grow by 30% per month.  And it literally led to a full house on the speech of our colleague <a href="http://supereon.ru/about/"><u>Leonid Shugurov</u></a> , who spoke about the integrated approach to managing the system of the partner business - Channel Ecosystem Management.  As part of this approach, the Difference, Loyalty Management, Rhythm Management and Change Management are implemented in the partner ecosystem.  In more detail we will tell about this decision another time.  Let me just say that the <a href="http://supereon.ru/cases/%3Fe%3D24"><u>partner portal</u></a> is an integral tool for building effective communications and training.  And this is the fastest way to develop or adapt a partner channel. <br><br>  And one more speech I want to note.  These are several stories by <a href="http://www.shiriaev.ru/"><u>Vadim Shiryayev</u></a> about how Russian manufacturers create new successful strategies and conquer the market.  And at the heart of these stories is the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3"><u>co-creation</u></a> approach, that is, the process when manufacturers combine with partners and customers to create something completely new.  And it gave me one thought: <br><br>  From the fact that you will help a man now, you will not receive immediate benefits.  But in the long run, this is the only right way to build relationships with the people around us.  As a simple person, I want people not to lock themselves in their little world, to help each other and in the end, everyone gets more than they give.  Because this is the essence of communities - community members benefit more than the sum of their personal contributions.  Yes, a corporate social network is not the only way to build open communications and a productive community, but this is not the main thing.  Just think about the energy of your employees, partners and customers that you can use for the benefit of yourself and them.  I saw how it works in corporate social networks, that's why I‚Äôm doing it. <br><br>  And finally.  Presentation of my presentation on how to use corporate social network for sales service. <br><br><br>  <strong><a title="Corporate social network for sales service" href="https://www.slideshare.net/ssuser73a73f/ss-52934232">Corporate social network for sales service</a></strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ssuser73a73f">Vladimir Ivanitsa</a></strong> <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Ivanitsa</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivanitsa"><u>Facebook</u></a> |  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivanitsa"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294718/</a></p>
