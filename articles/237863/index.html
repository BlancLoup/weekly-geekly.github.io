  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Target.NET</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post is intended for all fans of the .NET platform and the C # language.  I think many have met on the open spaces of the network a variety of tasks to understand certain features of the platform or language.  I am a big fan of such tasks and puzzles.  They help to better understand certain areas and enhance your own programming skills.  Once I decided to make a selection of similar problems so that I could show other people and discuss the nuances of working with .NET / C #.  When the problems have accumulated enough, a new idea appeared - to arrange my selection in the form of a book.  Your attention is given to the current version of this essay called "Problem.NET." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bb/cb0/f66/5bbcb0f66d8843fe8eb758a0bf28ec96.jpg" alt="Cover"><br>  <a href="http://problembook.net/">Read online</a> <br>  <a href="https://github.com/AndreyAkinshin/ProblemBook.NET/raw/master/TeX/ProblemBook.NET-ru.pdf">Download PDF version</a> <br>  <a href="">GitHub source codes</a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This book is a collection of tasks on the knowledge of the .NET platform and the C # programming language.  So that the reader and the author do not have any misunderstandings, I immediately want to say what this book <i>is not</i> : <ul><li>  This book is not a universal way to test your knowledge of the .NET platform.  This is not a collection of tasks for an interview.  If you easily solve all the problems, this does not mean that you are a great .NET programmer.  And if you have met a lot of new things for yourself, then it does not at all follow that you do not know .NET well. </li><li>  This book is not a selection of new, previously never seen tasks.  Many examples can be found in the literature, in questions on StackOverflow, in programmer blogs.  Just because they have become classic. </li><li>  This book is not focused on those who already consider themselves to be a senior .NET Developer and want to learn a lot. </li></ul><br>  So what then is this book?  The .NET problem book is an attempt to gather in one place different interesting practical tasks on the knowledge of the platform.  Most likely, .NET-developers, who have not yet been confronted with certain areas, will benefit the most for themselves.  Tasks are divided into chapters, so you can not read everything, but only questions from those areas that are of interest to you.  In this book you will not find deeply philosophical questions like ‚ÄúWhat is a class?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhy do we need polymorphism?‚Äù.  Most of the tasks is a fragment of the C # code, for which you need to determine the result of the work.  Each question is provided with an answer describing why .NET behaves that way.

      It is recommended to treat tasks not as a way to test your knowledge, but as a starting point for discussing certain aspects of the platform.  If you have discovered something new for yourself, then this is a great reason to learn .NET in a little more detail.  Try playing with the code: modify it and learn how changes affect the result.  Read the relevant literature.  Think about how new knowledge can be useful to you in your work. <br><br>  I guess that many may begin to resent: ‚ÄúBut in such and such a problem such a thing is not written entirely correctly!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhy are there so few tasks?‚Äù.  Therefore, I draw your attention that this is the first working version.  At the current stage, I would like to get some feedback: do I really need such an essay?  If necessary, in which direction is it better to develop it, what areas would it be great to write about?  I have accumulated a lot of interesting tasks in drafts (which I have not yet managed to draw up and include in the problem book) both for already existing chapters and for future ones.  First of all, chapters on multithreading, WPF and the life cycle of objects are planned. <br><br>  For each job at the end of the book has an answer.  Some of the answers are provided with a brief description of why this is exactly what happens.  Currently, detailed explanations are provided only for questions in the chapters "Mathematics", "Meaningful Types" and "Strings".  Answers are also planned to replenish and improve, because sometimes they contain basic useful information. <br><br>  A little about the technical part.  It‚Äôs not convenient for everyone to read ordinary books in a classic format, so it was decided to make an <a href="http://problembook.net/">online version</a> using <a href="https://www.gitbook.io/">GitBook</a> .  As a bonus - there are ePUB and MOBI versions.  But pdf on GitBook is simply ugly.  Therefore, I armed myself with LaTeX and folded a normal <a href="https://github.com/AndreyAkinshin/ProblemBook.NET/raw/master/TeX/ProblemBook.NET-ru.pdf">pdf-version</a> . <br><br>  I will be glad to constructive reviews about my short essay.  Also welcome new puzzles in any form: you can send them to me or join the <a href="">development on GitHub</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237863/</a></p>
