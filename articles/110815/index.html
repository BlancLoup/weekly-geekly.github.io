There are hundreds, if not thousands of jokes about such situations, and in general, society does not consider such cases to be something out of the ordinary.  But in the United States now there is an interesting legal process, the decision of which can become a judicial precedent.  The situation is quite anecdotal, if not its full seriousness. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The accused, 33-year-old Leon Walker, regularly read his wife's e-mail after finding out the password from her Gmail account.  It must be thought that there is no big problem in finding out the password from the mail, the messenger or the social network account.  Walker waited until his wife left home, and sat down to check her email.  In the end, the wife noticed something was wrong, made a scandal and not only - the case went beyond the family and got into the police.

      The most interesting thing is that the wife used her husband's laptop, and naturally, it was very easy for him to find out the password from her account in Gmail.  Our hero found out that his wife was going to return to her ex-husband, and made a scandal, telling the faithful, how he knew about everything.  The wife turned out to be particularly adventurous, and turned to the police, accusing her husband of breaking into her Gmail account.  The case immediately went to court, and Walker shines a full-fledged charge of violating the law on the inviolability of personal information, without any discount for family relations. <br><br>  The prosecutor requires five years in prison for her husband, and, according to lawyers who follow the process, the prosecution may well get his way - there are all components of a serious crime, by the standards of American legislation.  In general, the legal process is moving towards its logical conclusion, while the husband has less and less chance to justify himself. <br><br>  In general, if the court makes the decision expected by many, and Walker sits for several years, we can expect a large number of lawsuits of the spouses.  Wives and husbands will accuse each other of reading SMS, e-mail, and so on and so forth.  Now a woman or a man will think ten times, before pulling out the mobile phone of his ‚Äúhalf‚Äù, intending to make another SMS revision. <br><br>  It would be interesting to know what the community is thinking about such a process - do you think this is a frankly demanding legal process, or is it really a case that deserves close attention? <br><br>  Via <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20026611-71.html%3Ftag%3DcnetRiver">cnet</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110815/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110815/</a></p>
