In this article we summarize some of the year of work of our service.  Recall what was and is comparable with what is now.  Tackle - pride in the work done, <s>pathos,</s> graphics, tablets and other interesting things. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Code and functionality </h4><br>  After the announcement of the system, numerous errors were identified, which were corrected and corrected as they or we discovered them.  The number of lines of code from the publication of the first article has increased by more than 15 times.  "Vinoy" to this increase in functionality, which we constantly <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/m2m/blog/">announced in Habr√©</a> .  Different service modules work distributed on different servers, which allows even in peak to provide uninterrupted access to the service.  At the moment, there is a development of new functions, refinement and improvement of the old moments. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  When the project began to gain momentum and the first ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù situation with the Ukrainian provider arose, it was decided to transfer all servers away from our lands.  At the moment we have 4 German servers - Intel Core i7-920 Quadcore \ 12 GB DDR3 RAM \ 2x1500 GB, with data archiving on Amazon.  Geographically, the servers are located in different DCs, which also strengthens our faith in the stability and security of data.  Server load rarely exceeds 40%, so even when one of them exits, the user will not feel the difference in work. <br><br><h4>  Devices </h4><br>  We started small, there were only basic devices that at that time were on the market of Ukraine and the Russian Federation (and of course, devices of our own production).  At the moment, the service supports a little less than 150 types of devices and their modifications (the closest competitor recently announced that the mark was overcoming 200, so soon we will catch up with them, quite a bit left).  Among which, as "iron" gps devices, and popular programs for removal and sending gps data to the server.  Some companies themselves provided their protocols for adding their devices to our service, with some ( <a href="http://www.scout-gps.ru/">Scout</a> , <a href="http://www.tk-chel.ru/">Autograph</a> , <a href="http://www.apkcom.com/">ASK</a> and others) non-disclosure agreements were signed, since  their protocols are closed.  This year we have become richer in our own <a href="http://forum.gps-tracker.com.ua/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D13">Android application</a> , as well as an application under <a href="http://forum.gps-tracker.com.ua/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D56">WinMobile</a> , both developers have been with us for a long time and complement and modify their applications according to the wishes of users of our service (for which special thanks to them).  The service now fully supports all known types of fuel level sensors (digital, frequency, analog, flow meters).

    <h4>  Users </h4><br>  Was there any distrust on the part of the users?  It was also what, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa free service for monitoring transport was received with apprehension, there were often questions: about the fact that if it costs nothing, then no one is responsible for the work, etc.  The year of our work proved that a) we came for a long time, b) we value and value every user, c) we have kept the service free of charge for non-commercial use in full.  Here are the top ten with interest by country: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/adbf0519/5d8b45e7/bb0e7521/ac313a32.png"><br><br><h4>  Gain in numbers </h4><br>  To say that habr did not give anything is to lie.  Thanks to the first article, we received a rather serious impulse, which we are trying to preserve and increase. <br>  Number of devices added per month: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/94b18474/50d50c0f/7c8cdba1/15db55fc.png"><br>  Every month, at least one integrator company includes our service in the list of those.  services, which gives the right to think that software has the right to life and that we are doing something useful. <br><br><h4>  Plans </h4><br><ul><li>  Already ready your map server, put into operation before the end of the summer.  Independence from card providers + more accurate and correct content. </li><li>  Buying a subscription Google Premium api (if they still do not lie). </li><li>  Normal human translation and access to the European market. </li><li>  Sms, already ready for all countries of the world.  Do not run until it is clear the way they sell to the user. </li></ul><br><h4>  Donate </h4><br>  Of course, I want to have a great service on-line those.  user support and of course, that it was free, but it requires some financial investment.  <a href="http://forum.gps-tracker.com.ua/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D274">We will be happy to receive financial assistance from users of our resource</a> , and in return we guarantee even faster growth and those.  support, of course. <br><br>  So, exactly one year we are with you and we are glad that we have you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124591/</a></p>
