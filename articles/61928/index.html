We accidentally saw this toy with my father, he was just thinking about a laptop, and when he saw this little girl in action he said that this is what we need!  Since $ 430 compared to the minimum (at that time) $ 750 for a laptop, it was a pretty strong difference.  As a lawyer for him, computer requirements were minimal, typewriter and wi-fi + cdma (evdo) Internet access to the legal framework.  Bought, I started to set it up and ... fell in love with this toy.  Small, light.  Well, to hell with it that 4Gb of everything, we will buy a USB flash drive for 8GB (+ $ 50 on 07.2008), and expand the memory (another + $ 40) and we will definitely buy the battery.  Resolved!  I take one more.  Great!  Weight - perfect.  Windows XP ... Only here the truth slows down, and the battery for 1 hour barely enough, and there is no bluetooth, and Firefox is loaded.  We buy a screw for 100GB with a pocket (+ $ 100) and as a gift (and knee protection from the ‚Äústove‚Äù from below) I order myself and my dad two leather covers for eeepc (+ $ 45). <br><br>  New versions of 900, 901, 90X NNN, 1000 NNN appear (a bunch of letters at the back symbolize the model).  The memory becomes small, the 16GB SUN Disk flash drive is not always determined, to determine the need to raise the voltage, i.e.  the battery was not enough even for a movie.  There are news that released ...

    <h4>  Enthusiasm </h4><br>  <b>August 2008</b> ... MSI Wind U100.  With a grief in half, I sell my EeePC 701 for $ 320 (along with increased memory).  Proudly stomp to the store and take for (at that time) $ 580 MSI Wind U100 Pink (pink is to be different :)).  Happiness knew no bounds.  Fortunately, I immediately shoved 2GB of RAM (+ $ 30) and a USB mouse (+ $ 7).  ‚ÄúHappiness‚Äù has no limits, so we will immediately buy a handbag (+ $ 60), in order to wear this miracle (or rather, to wear a nightmarishly enormous charge for such crumbs).  Everything is perfect.  Netbook - just lovely!  At its 1.6 Atom and 2 GB of RAM and on a 2200 battery (standard) and with a included CDMA (EVDO) modem or Wi-Fi, you can sit as long as ... 1 hour 45 minutes.  Brrr ... disorder ... I have the time allotted for coffee and reading habr - 2.5 hours!  Well, we'll fix it now -&gt; ebay -&gt; msi wind u100 6-cell white -&gt; 110 $ -&gt; 3 weeks ... Oh!  Super!  As many as 4 hours of work, and if the brightness is completely extinguished, it is possible to withstand 4.5 hours.  Now you can work.  Although ... try to install Ubuntu.  In general, I will not explain here, -3 weeks of life.  Delays, damn it :).  Return to Windows.  MSI Wind U100 White + Lenovo S10 was taken, as a gift to parents and as a care for their vision, at a price ($ 490 + $ 25 for 2 GB of RAM). <br><br>  Now the tool itself is found!  Will be working.  From working tools only FAR + Firefox + Denwer + Photoshop.  (I joked about the latter on a netbook, yes? :)) The euphoria from the purchase lasted more than 3 months, but I was brought to December by a familiar Core Quad machine with 8Gb RAM, 22 "screen and Windows Vista, and I thought at home the stationary machine was not long ago, it was completely replaced by the old ASUS A6Rp (1.6 celeron, 15.4 "screen).  I thought about buying a 22 "monitor as an extension for a small ideal computer Wind'a. It was the first‚Äú nail. ‚ÄùThe 22" monitor with a resolution of 1680x1050px netbook did not pull, more precisely pulled, but the step-by-step pixel strategy was no good to me, but did not pull it out and my old ASUS.  It was decided to buy the same stationary car.  The second nail was a powerful home stationary computer with ASUS GeForce GT9800 1Gb, and a second 22 ‚Äùmonitor was purchased, the total cost of which was only $ 1050 (from warehouses). Naturally, all the work was transferred to it, since it was a pleasure to sit. By that time Delphi was carried away. But the netbook was a loyal assistant on the road. Wherever I went, I could ... check my mail and read Habr ... but not work, especially with my new hobby - Delphi. But with the more I started finding fault with the netbook. The sound sucks. The graphics sucks. Leave my beloved  for a week, it‚Äôs impossible, because I won‚Äôt be able to work behind a netbook, that is, as if I have something portable, but at the same time, I can‚Äôt do anything that loads - more than 1.5 minutes (believe me, this is a lot Yes. And the weight and dimensions with the 6-cell battery were not so pleased. The netbook ended up becoming what he and the manufacturer declared - an Internet reader and a typewriter, occasionally you can watch movies, but preferably dumb, because the sound sucks .  It has been 4 months in this state.  During this time I tried different models of HP 1233, ASUS 901, 1000H, Lenovo S10, Acer netbooks (the whole line) in my hands. <br><br><h4>  Change of priorities </h4><br>  May 2009.  Reading from a small screen, with constant scrolling, the hand is already hurting, dragging useless 1.5 kg (with charging if).  Everything!  I'm tired!  Criteria for a laptop: 1. CHEAPLY!  2. core 2 duo not lower than 2 GHz;  3. up to 4GB of RAM;  4. Screw&gt; = 160Gb;  5. Work at least 3 hours + possible additional order of the battery;  6. Weight not higher than 2.5 kg;  7. Warranty - at least 2 years.  8. Standard stuffing: BT + WiFi + DVDRW .;  9. 4xUSB;  10. Vista should work fast.  11. Support (without brakes) monitor in 22 ". I found the laptop instantly, it turned out to be the Dell Vostro 1310. The configuration is as follows: 13.3" (1280x800 matte) / C2Duo T8100 (2.1GHz) / 2Gb + 2GbRAM / GeForce 8400M 128Mb DDR3 / 250Gb 5400rpm /USB2.0x4/BT+WiFi+1394+LAN/FreeDOS/6-cell, Hr 3.5 + / 2.02Kg / 3 year warranty, price - $ 780.  In general, I will not praise him, I will say this, the most important thing in this is that it completely replaces my stationary car (except for games of course).  The weight of 2.02 kg is not felt at all, it is 5 mm higher in height than the MSI Wind U100, 4 cm in width, 5 cm longer in length.  In terms of battery life, it turned out to be higher than the stated - 4 hours is stable with Wi-Fi (while there are batteries extended at $ 80 = + 2.5 hours).  In terms of size, it fits into the same bag that I bought for a netbook (it was taken for 13.3 ", because otherwise Wind didn‚Äôt fit.) And the first thought came up in my head about the price. Damn it ... but how much I did you spend all the gadgets, flashcards, and other labuenes on this MSI Wind +? So now it's a modest, easy calculation. <br><br>  1. ASUS EeePC: 429 + 40 (operato) + (45/2) (case) +50 (card) +100 (screw) = $ 641.5 - $ 320 (sold!) = $ 321.5 <br>  2. MSI Wind U100: 580 + 30 + 7 + 110 + 60 = $ 787 <br>  those.  total account netbooks plus accompanying gadgets were spent $ 1108 for 1 year. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Those.  for the year I actually got so carried away that I didn‚Äôt notice how an amount exceeding the price of a NORMAL laptop (even for 2008) was spent on a typewriter.  It is possible to sell second-hand, ideally MSI Wind U100, even with an extended battery, no more than $ 380-400, i.e.  we stay with a bag with a card and a screw and pay for using a netbook&gt; $ 700.  Parents also changed netbooks for the same della.  Netbooks were sold both for $ 350 (MSI) and $ 430 (Lenovo) and a pair was also taken of the Dell Vostro 1310, with Intel X3100 graphics cards at $ 600. <br><br>  I specifically focused on the amount of money and all the costs of a netbook.  To date, the adjustment of the total amount will be ~ 150-200 $. <br>  Netbooks like niche computers are definitely needed, but ... Convince yourself that you need a laptop to work?  See for yourself in the direction of laptops on the market.  About $ 600 - we will end up with a full-fledged computer.  The price of a netbook is below $ 400 - it will be a netbook of the ‚Äúpast‚Äù generation - ASUS 901. That is,  a difference of $ 200-220 with a laptop.  A weight of 0.5kg is superfluous, absolutely not critical, and the battery performance of a laptop is no different (unless of course the laptop is taken for work, not for games).  The usefulness and functionality of the netbook is in no way equal to the money that manufacturers require for it.  Netbook prices should be no more than $ 150-200 per system with Atom 1.6 and a 1024x600 screen.  It is no longer worth it. <br><br><h4>  Why is he? </h4><br>  Netbook manufacturers positioning on the schoolchildren‚Äôs market = robbing their parents, although children should probably enjoy riding netbooks in the snow.  Positioning on students in lectures?  Well, you forgive me, but the student just needs a fully functional machine as well, since theoretically the average student will not have enough money for all.  Wife?  My Vostrik personally asked me, MSI Wind didn‚Äôt suit her precisely because of the impossibility of working for him for a long time, in order to see the screen, it is necessary to lean towards him, which spoils his posture and heavy and inconvenient charging.  Some here write one of the purposes of netbooks - READING BOOKS.  Are you kidding me?  How can you read it?  Here you can read books from the recently described CrunchPad, from an e-book you can, from a communicator you can (with difficulty), but from a netbook it is inconvenient - because the unfolded keyboard hinders.  Although if you are a ‚Äústern‚Äù person, then this is not a hindrance to you.  Use in the car as a navigator and media center, and also a touch screen.  This is what exactly resembles the fable "Monkey and glasses."  Yes, the skill of the Kulibins is sometimes surprising, but the question is, why?  Especially for the money, especially in a crisis time. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  <i>A year later, the MSI Wind U100 netbook, for me, remained a habr and newsroom in a cafe, now it is completely replaced by a laptop.</i>  <i>Old papinus ASUS YyyPC 701, peacefully hanging on a hook in the "rest room" instead of a fresh press.</i>  <i>The age of netbooks is complete for me and for a long time.</i> <br><br>  PS: I am once again convinced of my loyalty: The miser pays twice;  I'm not rich enough to buy cheap things ... <br>  PS2: The review is a bit emotional, but I didn‚Äôt want to write with boring facts, if something isn‚Äôt clear, I‚Äôll say everything in the comments.  :) <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> I will not write more at night, grammar and some errors in the text I found only after posting. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> <br>  Perfect netbook: <br>  1. OS loading no more than 10-15 seconds; <br>  2. Normal video playback (not necessarily HD); <br>  3. SSD (and only SSD) at least 20GB; <br>  4. The software package should include: Browser + Office + Multimedia + GPS; <br>  5. GPS (optional for some money). <br>  6. Work at least 3.5 hours (with the original original battery supplied !!!) <br>  7. Screen resolution - not less than 1280x800; <br>  8. 3xUSB port minimum + SD Card Reader; <br>  9. Wi-Fi + BT 2.0; <br>  10. The lack of a keyboard (for it must be present separately as an accessory, neatly fastened in a special fastening); <br>  11. Touch screen; <br>  12. Price for this entire set of not more than $ 350 in the CIS countries. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61928/</a></p>
