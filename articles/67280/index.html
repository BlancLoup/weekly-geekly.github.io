Namely in the company <a href="http://www.galileo.com.ua/m1/ru/about/o_komp">Galileo</a> .  For those who do not know, I will briefly say what GDS ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_reservations_system">Global Distribution Systems</a> ) is, which we are. <br><br>  In fact, the GDS are the same programs that travel agency employees open when you ask them to sell a ticket somewhere or to book a hotel.  Strangely enough, but still 99% of users use terminal programs in their daily work to access our resources.  Those.  ‚ÄúBlack screen - green letters‚Äù.  And believe, use quite actively.  The central repository, located in Atlanta, USA, constantly processes about 2500 requests per second.  These requests are sometimes quite difficult. <br><br>  For many, it is a great revelation that in one plane you will not always pick up 10 passengers who paid the same money for the flight.  In fact, for each flight the airlines set a lot of different fares.  Each tariff can have more than 100 rules of its application.  These rules may relate to time of stay, combination with other rates, conditions for returns and exchanges, and much more.  In order to maximize profitability and not lose passengers, airlines from time to time open and close all these fares.

      So here.  We are helping travel agencies to deal with all this business.  Especially when the flight consists of 5-6 points and you need to calculate all the rules, various options for connections, etc. <br>  But this is a topic for a separate topic.  If anyone is interested - I can expand the topic. <br>  Today is not about that. <br><br>  All this content is available from a large number of programs (there are more than 50 products in our company only).  This includes hundreds of thousands of hotels and hundreds of thousands of airline offers and car rentals and so on.  Often, the travel agency is not easy to understand all methods of payment, terms of use, connectivity, etc.  For this reason, a conscious desire arose to combine all of this into a single, as simple and elegant tool as possible. <br><br>  It's no secret that many projects are broken about 2 big problems: ‚Äúno customers‚Äù, ‚Äúno content‚Äù.  We are not afraid of the first or second.  Content, as you understand, is simply immense.  The only question is how to process, aggregate and provide it. <br><br>  Regarding users.  I can say that every travel agency in Ukraine (where our office is located), at the legislative level, is simply obliged to use our solutions in our work.  So, as they say ‚Äúthe biting will be such that the client will forget about everything‚Äù (c) (-: <br><br>  Access to all types of data is provided by means of SOAP.  So, it remains only to wrap it all in a coherent logic and provide in the form of pretty web-dancers, valid pages.  I really want to fasten ‚Äúsociality‚Äù to this, but this is only at the level of ideas. <br><br>  So I appeal to everyone who complains that they say "crisis", "no work", etc.  If you want to be part of this project, get professional training on the finer points of the tour.  business and generally work in a cozy young team, then you are welcome in a personal / in the comments. <br><br>  The prospective applicant must have a complex of knowledge necessary to work on Internet projects.  On Habr√©, I think it would be foolish and ridiculous to list specific requirements (-: <br><br>  It is supposed to program everything using open standards and technologies.  I cannot give any specifics, since the choice of all technologies and development methods will be made by the development team itself. <br><br>  From myself I can only promise a very decent permanent salary, serious equipment, training and a hospitable team.  It is supposed to work on a permanent basis in an office in Kiev. <br><br>  So, waiting for your resume% USER_NAME%! <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br><ul><li>  Jobs are only in Kiev </li><li>  The work is not a one-time, but a permanent.  Aviation just does not leave.
