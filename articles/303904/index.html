  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apei Gaming - to be a project! (Part 2)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day.  About a week has passed since the official launch of the project.  I think not many expected to see the continuation of this blog.  But what to hide, I myself did not fully believe that there would be like-minded people who have the same point of view and are ready to help not only in word but in deed.  I had no doubts in myself, and as I described in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303506/">first part</a> , if there is a response, we will jointly make a truly worthwhile organization out of this idea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8da/36d/656/8da36d656574700f97a826268d10d77a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303506/">The first article</a> on Habr√© caused a huge resonance, and we received countless comments and opinions, but the most shocking (in the best sense of the word) was for me the number of <a href="http://apeigaming.com/index.php%3Fthreads/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8.1/">applications for membership</a> in the organization.  As usual, I got up in the morning, brewed a cup of coffee and opened my laptop to check my mail, and remained seated with a mug in hand, as there were over 200 letters in the mail in which people told about themselves and offered all kinds of help or showed desire to participate in this project. <a name="habracut"></a>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"

      When the number of applications exceeded 300, I realized that it was physically impossible to communicate with each one and communicate personally.  As a result, it was decided to launch the organization's portal, and I notified all the participants of this project. <br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/619/aba/512/619aba5127dc5444732cd5489b32d300.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Welcome to family.</b> <br>  Friends, with great pleasure and with undisguised pride, I want to inform you that there will be a project for Apei Gaming.  Many people were interested in the blog article, and we received more than 350 applications in the first week, which simultaneously shocked and delighted me.  I expected to find 2-3 enthusiastic people, and found a whole family, ailing and fighting for modern e-sports in the CIS.  If you received this email, then the first, easiest stage of all this event is passed.  Now the real work begins. <br><br>  In an emergency order, we launched the alpha version of the <a href="http://www.apeigaming.com/">site</a> .  I would like to talk with each person personally, but unfortunately, as I later realized, it is physically impossible.  Therefore, we transfer all communication to the open spaces of the community portal.  Thank you all again, before the connection! <br><br>  Sincerely, Ivan "apei" Sofin </blockquote><br>  Then all the days turned into one big "jelly", in which I specifically stuck.  New letters came faster than we managed to process them, the community portal was unstable and constantly had to change and modify something.  People had a huge number of questions, and my PM was just bursting with messages.  But for me this is true happiness, and I am glad that I had the courage to launch the Apei Gaming project. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b6/6eb/9ea/5b66eb9ea11b3400b085467b23a0405c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  To date, more than 10 meetings and planning meetings have been held.  The workflow has returned to normal, so there was a free moment to share the latest news with the readers of this blog.  Among the applications, the overwhelming majority were from highly professional people who could really bring a lot of benefit to the organization.  But applying to the organization is one thing, but real action for the dream to come true is quite another.  I have absolutely no right to demand something from someone, since everything is done on a voluntary basis and is really built on the enthusiasm of interested people.  But precisely for the sake of these people, I am ready to do everything in my power to bring our initiative to success. <br><br>  A close-knit, family team, in which everyone knows each other, a huge motivation and knowledge of the cause - all this carries in itself endless potential and separates us from the soulless organizations that buy top stars to realize their abilities.  We want to create a community, a definite idea and prove that eSports is not a closed club of elite players and organizations, but an occupation that is available to everyone, like football or basketball, but the level at which we will play this ‚Äúfootball‚Äù will depend only from us! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fa/c78/b00/0fac78b0064bb563808cfe043dca6b3b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So that readers or perhaps future participants of our project clearly understand what I am talking about, I will explain my main concept, which concerns the organization and recruitment of teams in the community: <br><br>  <b>1) There is no limit on the level of the player (MMR, Rank, etc.).</b> <b><br></b>  <b>2) There is no limit on the number of teams in the divisions.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>3) The team must have e-sports orientation.</b> <br><br>  Now we will sort each item separately: <br><br>  <b>There is no limit on the level of the player</b> - for someone it may seem wild, but the meaning and purpose of this whole undertaking is to give people who are really motivated to try themselves in the cyber arena.  Yes, they should be aware that they won‚Äôt get to Major or International, but to play at a local or online tournament and possibly take a prize there is a very real prospect.  I personally played at the oblast level and still remember these years with warmth. <br><br>  <b>There is no limit on the number of teams in the divisions</b> - from the first paragraph follows the second, since we can not keep 1 command of the lowest level, this makes no sense.  There can be any number of compositions in the organization, we can designate them in numbers or letters or colors, this is not of fundamental importance, but the priority attention of the organization, coaches, analysts and sponsors will naturally be directed to the first composition.  It will also motivate 2-3-4 and so on to raise their level and move to a stronger team while increasing their skill.  And the 1st squad will have a base of players, from which they will be able to pick up substitutes for themselves in case someone doesn‚Äôt pull. <br><br>  <b>A team must have a cyber-sports orientation</b> - this is the most important point, since any team (even the 10th) must understand that we are a cyber-sports organization, not a club of interests.  Therefore, this squad must train and compete in tournaments as often as possible.  If people from the composition will just get together to play in public or talk in the vehicle, such a composition will be disbanded. <br><br><blockquote>  So, in a little more than a week, we managed to get 350+ applications, connect 120+ community members, create and configure a portal, raise a TS3 server, and organize the work of the organization. <br><br>  <b>Today, <a href="http://www.apeigaming.com/index.php%3Fmembers/%26type%3Dstaff">our team</a> has:</b> <br>  1) Managerial staff (Dota2) <br>  2) Coaching and analysis department (Dota2, LOL, CS: GO) <br>  3) Dota2 players (one composition) <br>  4) LOL players (two incomplete EUW and RU servers) <br>  5) CS: GO players (one squad already started training) <br>  6) IT department (despite the huge number of applications, it is still in its infancy) <br>  7) Media Department (the weakest link, but we will fix it) <br></blockquote><br>  There is still a lot of work to be done.  For such an extensive project, both the management staff and the players themselves are still lacking, but all of the above only strengthens me in the thought that everything was done correctly.  We have already built a long-term development strategy, and I will try to keep you informed.  There are still many interesting topics and directions that I would like to talk about, but I will save them for the next posts.  Thank you all for your support and constructive criticism. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303904/</a></p>
