      President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin issued a decree on the need to create a state system to combat cyberterrorism.  By his decision, he, in fact, officially announced the entry of Russia into the electronic era and the accession of technologically leading states to the club, which in recent years have been compelled to fight invisible and practically invulnerable enemies. <br><br>  For cyber-terrorists there are no state borders, they easily penetrate any objects in any countries where there is a connection to the global information network Internet.  The actions of hackers pose a threat not only to ordinary users, but also to the security of the most developed countries. <br><br>  And Russia is no exception.  In our country, hacker attacks have been repeatedly subjected to the sites of leading media, information systems of state organizations, politicians, merchants, and personal information of famous actors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Not only the media and VIPs are helpless in front of virtual weapons, computer viruses, a wide variety of spyware, but also any arsenals of weapons: nuclear missiles, airplanes, artillery and tanks. <br><br>  Moreover, the most up-to-date models of military equipment can be destroyed, for example, by false teams, introduced by hackers into electronic control panels, or into chips responsible for controlling a formidable weapon. <br>  They are trying to find salvation from electronic threats in the USA, Israel, and Western Europe, where cyber threat prevention centers have already been established. <br><br>  However, the war between states and hackers comes with varying success.  They have not yet succeeded in creating an effective integrated electronic protection against cyber-terrorists.  This fact is evidenced by regular reports in the media about the numerous hacks of computer systems of the largest Western TV channels, newspapers, information portals, financial institutions, military and defense departments. <br><br>  In the light of these events, it may seem that the prospects of the Russian national center for electronic security do not look very convincing.  After all, it is no secret to anyone that the Achilles heel of modern Russia is a lag in the sphere of high technologies and the production of electronic devices. <br><br>  To fix this gap, it will take more than one year.  Experts know that the creation of information protection systems is directly related to the electronic filling used in the equipment.  Manufacturers often embed software ‚Äúbookmarks‚Äù into chips that cannot be manufactured in our country and are purchased abroad.  They work, if not for hackers, then in the interests of the states in which they are created. <br><br>  But, oddly enough, even in this seemingly hopeless situation, Russia has every chance not only to successfully cope with the challenge of time, but also to become a world leader in the field of information security systems. <br>  For example, the experience of Americans in the space industry, which is strategically important for the state, shows that cooperation with private companies can lead to quick, efficient and cost-effective solution to problems of any complexity.  Until the continuation of the strategically important national space program. <br><br>  By the way, this example is also relevant because it reminds me of the topic touched upon.  For certain reasons, without being able to continue the national manned program with their own funds, NASA is forced to rent Russian space technology and thereby support Russian industry.  Only by allowing the launch of private spacecraft owned by American companies, they successfully solved the current tactical tasks facing them, concentrating on important strategic objectives, such as preparing a manned flight to other planets. <br><br>  A similar situation is possible today in Russia in the field of information security.  For example, the development of the company "Ankort" in the field of cryptographic protection of information of mobile phones is much ahead of similar equipment available in the United States and Europe.  Moreover, they do not exist on paper, but in the form of existing product samples.  Last year, Ankort presented an information system for protecting information of mobile phones at the world's largest exhibitions of computer equipment and weapons.  According to leading experts, it surpasses all current developments.  In the West, it has already been dubbed ‚Äúthe killer of hackers‚Äù and they want to buy with pleasure in many countries of the world.  That's just the question, will the unique Russian development be in demand in Russia? <br><br>  At the beginning of the two thousandth, the company "Ankort" was a pioneer in the cooperation of domestic private enterprises with the largest government agencies.  In the midst of an unprecedented fraud with ‚Äúfake payment advices‚Äù, which became the largest and most successful hacker attack on state banking systems in world history, our development of those years in the shortest possible time ensured the financial security of the Central Bank of Russia. <br><br>  This year has been 20 years since our system continues to operate successfully.  For two decades of operation of the cryptosystems of the company ‚ÄúAnkort‚Äù in the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the criminals have never managed to crack them!  For 20 years, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation has been using a private cryptoalgorithm to protect financial payments developed by Ankort. <br><br>  At one time, the Royal Technological University of Sweden (determining, by the way, candidates for the Nobel Prize) analyzed the cryptoalgorithm of our company and admitted that it cannot be decrypted during the Universe's existence using the highest-speed computers in the world. <br><br>  We do not hesitate to talk about it, because we know about the superiority of Russian developments in the field of information protection over the world-wide hacker empire.  And we want all Russians to know this too and have the ability to effectively counter the threat from the virtual world. <br><br>  Information security of the country can not be considered only a state or only a private priority.  It affects the interests of ordinary citizens, businessmen, and civil servants. <br><br>  Each of us is equally responsible for the Freedom and the future of our country. <br><br>  <i>Anatoly Klepov,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>President of the company "Ankort"</i> <br>  <i><a href="http://www.stealthphone.ru/">www.stealthphone.ru</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169831/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169831/</a></p>
