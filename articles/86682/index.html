How I refused to waio</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Epigraph: ‚ÄúWhy is he so healthy?‚Äù <br>  Everyone who saw this eyser in my hands <br><br><h6>  <b>History number one</b> </h6><br>  I somehow drowned Asus EEE 900, bought back at the time when they were just released.  Frankly, I did not feel any pity after that.  Moreover, the nedobuk was heating deliberately, so my love was my hatred =).  And all because of the keyboard.  On the laptop, you have to fill a lot of text, whether it be coursework, lectures, messengers or something else.  But with the keyboard of the Nine Hundred the obsessive desire came to throw it into the wall.  Yes, the buttons there are small, but my fingers are not sausages.  Just to fill the text, I had to knock on the laptop like a typewriter, otherwise half the words lacked half the letters, plus all sorts of little things, such as a cooler humming like a steam train, not a bad heating and so on. <br>  In general, in the end I chose this machine, and looking ahead, I will say that I am very pleased with it, although there are some nuances. <br><br>  So, a small overview of the pretty big netbook Acer Aspire 1410 Black

    <img src="http://www.medialife.ru/static/prodpic/001238-1.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the cut a few photos, screenshots, background number two, and so on. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I apologize in advance for the poor quality of the photographs: the lines are everywhere straight, they have been curved <s>out by the</s> shafts. <br><br><h6>  <b>Prehistory number two</b> </h6><br>  When choosing a new typewriter, I proceeded primarily from the fact that the keyboard on the new nete should be comfortable.  Having been to Thailand in the Sony brand store and having admired Vaio W1, I thought that this was for me the most. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea1/3fb/622/ea13fb6228b121d62c7bb4547d922783.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Plus, the screen is not 1024x600, but 1366x768 with a diagonal of 10 inches, plus a mouse and a cover in the kit.  <s>Well, Ponte, of course.</s>  .  There it cost 20k, which is not very clear, because Japan is much closer to Thailand than to Peter.  Well, not the essence.  I climbed onto Kay's site, where it cost 19990. On the RiCa site, he also showed up, but for 15,500. It turned out that the difference between them in the lack of a mouse and a cover (!).  Not critical.  After 2 days, arriving at Rick, it was discovered that only poisonous pink remained.  Apparently, I was not the only one who was so clever, and the whites were quick to grind. <br>  But Vayo left a mark on the criteria of my choice (I will later compare these two units, <s>and understand that Vayo did not need to buy</s> ).  Now I wanted a netbook with a resolution of 1366x768. <br>  The fact is that I draw in Anime Studio Pro, and even the 1024x768 doesn‚Äôt fit on the screen.  What to say about 1024x600.  By the way.  I almost forgot.  On that day, when I went for Vayo, I got the impression that the RiK (the one on Liteiny), or rather the netbook department, had a flock of locusts: almost all the machines were sold out. <br>  Oh, forgive me my lyrical digression, back to the hero of the post. <br><br><h6>  <b>Buying a unit</b> </h6><br>  This miracle cost the same as Vayo 15.5 kilorubles, and just as Vayo was supplied without a case and a mouse.  Again, not critical.  Another thing is that the screen diagonal is 11.6 (which is more than the standard netbook, but we'll come back to this), because we had to look for a bag in the department for large laptops.  In general, a discount came out like 15178 rubles 23kop. <br><br><h6>  <b>Actually review</b> </h6><br>  Since I do not know much about the glands, the review will be purely external and will be based only on my feelings. <br>  So, the box: <br><br><img src="http://s004.radikal.ru/i205/1003/36/18ab9831077b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the front side there is a blue version of the case, but I did not like it, although it is a matter of taste.  I did not see red and white at all, but if they were, I probably would have taken white. <br><br>  Expand the box: <br><img src="http://i050.radikal.ru/1003/65/13b84c4d3b81.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The delivery, as you can see, is very modest: a netbook, a battery, a power cord.  And of course any tinsel of type of warranty, handbook and other delights.  No boot disks or driver disks were found (in the EEE900 there was a disk with Xandros and firewood for Vindovoz). <br><br>  Now the unit itself. <br>  The first thing that catches your eye is a gloss. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e1a/f4d/2fe/e1af4d2feca3bf0b1b87ecc13aba81fd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <s>FUUU.</s>  Even taking pictures is not very successful, then the walls gleam, then flash.  Well, in general, you understand.  Left Above Acer logo. <br>  Further, in size, it is really noticeably more than its competitors in the niche of netbooks.  (write that dimensions: 28.5 * 20.4 * 3 cm. I didn‚Äôt measure myself - lazily) <br>  Weight - 1.35 kg.  Easy, yes.  Though big. <br>  There is no latch for the lid, however, it will not open in the bag. <br>  Okay, open the lid: Ta-daaammmm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/944/abf/c27/944abfc27ba0e7fe344f6ea202c3ca71.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Again gloss.  The edge of the screen and the screen itself are glossy.  It looks beautiful, but impractical, damn it!  In the middle is quite a standard webcam, and on the perimeter of the rubber blotches. <br><br><h6>  <b>Little admiration</b> </h6><br>  Well at least the bottom of the matte.  And completely. <br>  The keyboard pleased me wildest. <br><br><img src="http://s58.radikal.ru/i160/1003/ed/6869aa3c3903.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The buttons are large, moderately pressed, do not sink, the socket does not bend. <br>  The navigation keys are not very well made: they are too small and often miss when you work blindly.  But also uncritical: after all, not the most used buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/791/e1f/8c9/791e1f8c97136efd4b90b41f4bf0351c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Pleased Big Shifty, Fn button to the right of the control. <br><br><img src="http://s04.radikal.ru/i177/1003/ca/f11a465c059c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Perhaps only poor E had been harvested, arrows, and Enter also shares (although he didn‚Äôt miss him).  Actually the post itself on this netbook and typed. <br>  Keyboard edging is made of gray plastic, with imitation of longitudinal scratches.  The touchpad looks very cool against their background. <br><br><img src="http://i079.radikal.ru/1003/bb/dcd64f81a315.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Liked.  The touchpad itself is not recessed into the case, so that the dust at the sides will not accumulate (sleep in a sweet sleep, EEE900).  There is a multitouch, scroll bar too, but it is not indicated.  Although it's easier for me to scroll with two fingers.  The buttons under the touchpad are made simply divine.  They are pressed very quietly, gently. <br>  At the top left there are indicators of the processor's work, as well as the KapsLok and NamLok indicators, which I lacked in EE900. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/def/ce1/fde/defce1fdeef56e508bae339f05b30d07.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To the left of the touchpad are indicators on-off, charging, blues and Wi-Fi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f4/334/aa5/8f4334aa513bc2f26ec5e928a6309b1c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With the lid closed, all indicators are visible. <br>  In general, except for the keyboard and touchpad on the bottom of the extra buttons there.  Only on / off button. <br><br><img src="http://s57.radikal.ru/i158/1003/a6/91ba357cb336.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Everything is fitted very soundly, no gaps, backlashes, bending, squeaks are not observed. <br>  Another one of my admiration for the battery: six-cell, holds 6.5 hours in the typing mode, a little bit sitting in wi-fay. <br><br><h6>  <b>Little standard</b> </h6><br>  Connectors like everywhere else <br>  On right: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/032/0d7/293/0320d7293ae49b31dc3b1e287e7cb104.jpg" alt="image"><br>  USBx2, SD card reader, audio in / out, Ethernet and Kensington.  I note that the upper corners of the lower part are slightly bevelled, because the lan-cord sticks out slightly at an angle. <br>  Left: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/471/ac1/f1d/471ac1f1d9a1623d3788c4f90f66e531.jpg" alt="image"><br>  power cord connector, HDMI, USBx1, projector connector and grille.  The radiator is quiet, but the air flow is quite noticeable. <br>  During operation, the unit never heated up, and almost did not make noise.  In my opinion, the hard disk creaks louder than the cooler works. <br>  Bottom many lattices and two removable covers. <br><br><img src="http://i067.radikal.ru/1003/ad/ff5c3515eac0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The speakers are quite standard, so use headphones. <br><br><h6>  <b>Now the insides</b> </h6><br>  Here, in general, everything is written: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/670/09d/9f5/67009d9f5d1a43e07e8d18d52042d06b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By how much I understand the hardware is not very, then from hearsay: the processor is slightly better than 270-280 Atoms, the video is slightly faster.  If you have knowledgeable, you can unsubscribe in the comments. <br>  HDD 250 GB, which is gut, since most non-SSD-containing netbooks have 160 GB of memory. <br>  2GB RAM is also more than normal. <br>  Screen 11.6, which is again more than in netbooks <br>  But all this is less than in laptops. <br>  In general, Acer is a little better and a little easier. <br><br>  Wi-Fi is powerful, I only saw 2 networks in an apartment before, and he immediately found 8 for me. <br>  Sinezub did not use <br>  Next, the package comes with Windows7 Starter.  As an ordinary user, I have enough.  Fortunately, the restriction on 3 simultaneously launched programs was removed.  The only thing that has been cut back is the ability to change wallpaper <s>, but who cares?</s>  <s>=)</s> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d64/7fc/d8c/d647fcd8c039555dae5c14e47fa13ea6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://s13.radikal.ru/i186/1003/c2/a735f1f25457.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The system flies without brakes. <br>  True performance index even when working from the network refused to calculate. <br><br><h6>  <b>Conclusions and afterword</b> </h6><br>  In general, it is good that Vayo B1 was bought up before my arrival in RiK.  As I see now, 1366x768 is too much for 10 '.  Plus 2GB, instead of Vayovsky 1GB.  Plus (seemingly) more powerful percent and video. <br><br>  In short, according to the parameters, I will not enjoy this aggregate.  Especially the screen, the dimensions of which are well correlated with the resolution <br><br><img src="http://s15.radikal.ru/i189/1003/88/306557160a2d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Only fiercely annoying the LUSTER, and rather bright diodes.  Plus, the keyboard design suggests that it will have to be cleaned quite often: too large gaps between the buttons. <br>  Thanks for attention! <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86682/</a></p>
