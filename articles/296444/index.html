      This tool is not an invention of this year.  And the market giants are known to any experienced marketer.  Recall that the largest video hosting service at the moment is YouTube, which also acquired Google back in 2012. One can rightly call Facebook and Bing advertising platforms.  Earlier in the articles we already mentioned the <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/blog/2015/06/micromoments/">micro-moments</a> and the possibilities of <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/blog/2015/10/video-kak-budushee-mobile-reklami/">pre-roll</a> advertising.  What will be the foreshadowed year of 2016 for these channels?  Google will contribute to the development of video advertising, launching the latest product on the market, whose name is in-SERP.  Why is it profitable?  To this channel of promotion there is an impressive coefficient of loyalty of the end user, which makes it payable and in demand.  And the release of a new progressive product confirms this data. <br><br>  In the case of the continued development of the video channel, Google advertising upgrades the possibilities of advertising traffic on YouTube.  However, this will become known only after the first quarter of 2016 and the results of further product development. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The explosion of popularity of applications due to their indexing</b> </li></ul><br><br>  As we know from the latest data, applications also began to be indexed in the Google search engine.  It was assumed that it was introduced only temporarily.  However, already in 2016 the process of their ranking will be improved and complicated.  From here derive their direct visual advantages, a lightweight form of user perception and a virtually unlimited audience.  Sites, which we also mentioned earlier, namely, their mobile adaptation will continue to prevail over non-adapted sites, but this is not all.  In the near future, the popularity of applications will increase and surpass even the most adapted and user-friendly websites.  And everything is quite explicable: this will happen due to their interactivity and even greater clarity on functionality, convenience and accessibility. <br><br>  Over the course of several years, applications will reach the level that will allow them to become a worthy replacement for applications, but 2016 will be the key in this industry. <br><br>  Final and unprecedented <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/blog/2015/11/2-reshaushih-factora-v-povedenii-potrebitalya/">dominance of mobile devices</a> over stationary PCs <br>  The year 2015 has practically become the <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/blog/2015/10/insaiderskie-issledovaniya-kompanii-google/">key to the development of the mobile sphere</a> and its fundamental specificity.  According to Google, mobile traffic has finally exceeded traffic, which is recorded as visits from stationary PCs in more than 10 different countries.  We also mentioned that this year was also marked by the update of the <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/blog/2015/10/801/">Mobilegeddon</a> algorithm, which aims to oust <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/blog/2015/11/top-4-factora-rangirovaniya/">non-optimized and non-adaptive</a> sites from the top search results.  At the same time, the search giant completely accepts the presence of only a mobile version of the site, which is also important to have in focus. <br><br>  So far, this alone is not enough for the data on stationary traffic to finally fall before traffic from mobile devices.  But mobile advertising platforms are already receiving huge support from Google.  This means a global reorientation of marketing towards mobile devices.  Due to the fact that this is not yet a ‚Äúred ocean‚Äù (if you use niche marketing terminology), then market leaders and brands have a great opportunity to outrun competitors using this channel as a prospect and advantage in global interaction with their customers. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Electronic helpers will change the usual idea of ‚Äã‚Äãoptimization</b> </li></ul><br><br>  Are you already using electronic helpers such as Siri and Cortana?  Now the most popular strategies to attract traffic to the sites are two tools: search engine optimization and pay-per-click advertising (CPC).  But the spread of electronic helpers will inevitably lead to the emergence of a new kind of optimization.  Siri and Cortana have already become a new incarnation of a simple helper in search surfing.  They replaced the traditional search engines, but as you know, so far only in the search for information. <br><br>  The key strategy in this direction remains one of the unshakable elements of content marketing - make sure that your content is accessible to voice search engines. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>New milestone in the development of virtual reality</b> </li></ul><br><br>  Dozens of different augmented reality devices have already planned out the dates for their releases and mass access to thousands of new users.  Undoubtedly, many will be highly specialized, aimed only at one specific industry (for example, only for video games), but many of them will have a common focus.  Have you heard of the Oculus Rift?  It is likely that at the moment it is the most trendy device at the moment, which, according to the scale of the developed marketing company and PR, is commensurate with the release of the Martian film to the public.  The Oculus Rift release is scheduled for the first quarter of 2016, so keep your finger on the pulse.  It and many other virtual reality devices will create the conditions for the emergence of a completely new field of online advertising, as they allow to integrate with social media platforms, video channels and even direct messages.  In addition, billions of dollars are invested almost every month in the development of augmented reality devices, which predicts their wild popularity in the near future. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Wearable devices and the Internet of things (IoT) will open new horizons</b> </li></ul><br><br>  Smart gadgets will not compete in scale with augmented reality devices, but their popularity is already gaining momentum.  What gives reason to believe about their peak popularity in 2016.  There is a well-known entry into the market of another Apple product, namely, the acclaimed Apple Watch, the first-generation smart watch.  Following which began to appear and other analogues. <br><br>  The functionality of smart devices is being finalized today.  So, marketing for these devices will gain its popularity by 2016. The clear line between ‚Äúreal‚Äù and ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù advertising will become even more blurred. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Rise in the cost of advertising</b> </li></ul><br><br>  Due to the rapid growth of advertising budgets allocated to Internet marketing tools, it is expected that in 2016 the trend will continue to gain momentum.  According to the laws of the market, the growth of demand leads to higher prices, so marketers will continue to increase the cost of online advertising. <br><br>  Higher prices entail a natural decline in demand and decline of companies unable to withstand such shakes. <br><br>  <b><i>In 2016, of course, there are still many discoveries.</i></b>  <b><i>However, for you we have put together the most significant seven trends.</i></b>  <b><i>According to Forbes recommendations, internet marketers and brand owners should make bets on the above channels and tools.</i></b>  <b><i>It is they who can help you overtake competitors.</i></b>  <b><i>And after all, it is about this that the leading leaders of the global consumer market dream.</i></b> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296444/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296444/</a></p>
