The article was about kulhunterov (hunter for fashion trends). <br>  One of the obzatsev was devoted to the emo subculture.  The youth course was analyzed by specialists in order to identify the features and the further transfer of data to marketers.  The article had a wonderful definition, terribly pleasant to me: <i>emo - these are goths, which parents did not let into the cemetery.</i> <br>  Up to this point, I knew a little about emo, all my knowledge was limited to reading one article, the content of which I managed to forget partially. <br>  The material in the Secrets of the firm excited my interest in emo.  After reading several articles and looking at the emo community, I had the idea to create my own community.  The main purpose of the project is to try to promote the community from scratch, to experiment with methods to attract visitors. <br><br>  <b>The first day</b> <br>  I immediately decided that the community will be on the platform liveinternet.ru.  Firstly, a lot of emo-kids live there, and secondly, I know well the mechanisms of the service, thirdly, it is possible to attach a second-level domain. <br>  I needed a second-level domain, since I planned to attract a significant part of traffic from search engines from the very beginning.  For these purposes, name.ru is more suitable than liveinternet.ru/users/name. <br>  As always, all the good domains were occupied by cybersquatters.  Revising several options, I opted for <a href="http://www.emo-emo.ru/">www.emo-emo.ru</a> <br>  After registering a domain, a community was created on LiRu.  The emo-emo name was taken (not to mention just emo or emo).  Not becoming to sort out further, registered as emoemo.  A little later, I realized that the name is not very good, because the domain is a dash, the name of the Emo-Emo community sounds better, and emoemo will be displayed in the internal links and ratings of LiveInternet.  Confusion is possible. <br>  Next, we compose the semantic core of the blog, using wordstat.yandex.ru and open statistics of site counters on similar topics. <br>  <i><b>Costs:</b></i> $ 19 per domain.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Second day</b> <br>  First of all, it is necessary to write several messages in the community before attracting users to it.  The community should not be empty.  Publish posts of a general nature - who are such emo that they listen to how to dress. <br>  Then I create rubrics, interest list and diary title using words from the semantic core.  The list of interests is an important thing; service users will come along similar interests.  The title tells what is dedicated to the community. <br>  I was lucky on the second day of the existence of the community - I found a moderator.  More precisely, he found me.  I was sent a personal message by an emo girl with a proposal to help in moderation and promotion of the community.  (She would know how to guess with the promotion).  I accepted her help with pleasure.  The moderator is vital, especially in such communities as Emo, where there are increased risks of littering the community, due to the peculiarities of the age category of its participants. <br>  The girl understands the subculture better than I do - together we edit the name of the headings. <br>  <i><b>Community Attendance:</b></i> 18 people. <br><br>  <b>First week</b> <br>  After adding the first topics, the diary title, headings and the list of interests, I make up the rules.  They are simple, but necessary: <br>  Prohibited any advertising in the community (punishment up to the ban). <br>  Big pictures hide under the tag more = below. <br>  Do not write in giant and colorful fonts!  Express your feelings with words, not the size of letters! <br>  Respect other community members. <br>  Do not flood. <br><br>  I begin the active stage of search engine promotion site: registration in directories, buying links. <br>  <i><b>Costs:</b></i> $ 25 for registration in catalogs. <br><br>  <b>Second week</b> <br>  I advertise the community in other communities specifically designed to advertise diaries and notify about the emergence of new communities. <br>  Create a button and a container for placing the button code.  I publish them in the diary epigraph, so that anyone who wants to support the community can post a button on their blog. <br>  I publish articles about emo groups, optimizing the text and post title for certain search queries.  I link to newly created topics.  Total blog is promoted by 3 dozen requests. <br>  Gradually requests appear in the search, attendance is growing, the number of regular readers is growing.  On the tenth day, the number of blog visitors reaches 1000 people. <br>  <i><b>Costs:</b></i> $ 25 for the purchase of links. <br><br>  <b>Third to fourth week</b> <br>  In essence, community development has taken its course.  I just expect the withdrawal of requests for the first places in search engines. <br>  After appearing in the top, the number of transitions from the search grows, attendance reaches 2,000 people per day. <br><br>  <b>Now</b> <br>  The community steadily keeps the second place in the number of visitors among all the community liveinternet.ru.  203 regular readers (although here I expected to see a big number).  125 blog entries. <br><br>  Of course, if the theme of the community were different, its promotion would take more time and effort.  In this case, we can say that I just grabbed the still fashion trend, which, by the way, according to experts of the company's Secret, is already declining. <br><br>  PS  A few words about what the community is giving me now.  I put a thematic link to a resource friendly to me that is about to publish articles about emo culture.  CTR links pleasantly surprised me: 9-11% stable.  There were days when the number of crossings reached 12-13% of the total number of visitors. <br>  A week after the creation of the community, they knocked me out with a proposal for advertising.  They didn‚Äôt apply anymore, apparently the price I marked out scared me.  Today was an attempt from other people, and I agreed with their proposal.  We start experimenting with the monetization of the blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288704/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288704/</a></p>
