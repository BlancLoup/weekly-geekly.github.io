In particular, most of them were of a practical nature - everyone was interested in “how it works”, “can you administer the network from it”, “will it start on the 1C tablet”, “why Intel Atom is used”, “what is with SAP” “Can I install Linux on it” and so on.  Having a little consultation, we decided to write about it in more detail.  You are welcome under the cat! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Picture One: introductory </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df4/0e4/771/df40e477166579ebf8170736d433f34e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, as we all already know, Dell has recently launched a new tablet computer, the Latitude 10. Notice, “tablet computer” - the abbreviation of this word looks like “PC”, doesn’t resemble anything?  Of course, PC = personal computer, for a long time we all know this abbreviation.  So, in the case of Latitude 10, "PC", in fact, means exactly the same thing.  “We in the company perceive it as a“ personal computer ”and have not regretted it for a second,” says Alexander Beloglintsev, product manager of the company.  The device really functions exactly like a PC and is controlled accordingly.  This also applies to the user’s interaction with the device, and device administration in the enterprise’s network - there is a full-featured Windows 8 installed. From the user’s side, in principle, everything is clear - the “Windows” and in Africa the “Windows” are no different from the same versions on any desktop or laptop, but at the same time a wider field of activity opens up before users, because you can always take a tablet with you and fully work with the same software as at work!  And when the time comes to the authorities or you need to sit in the office until late and work on the big screen (by the way, you can also work on the big screen at home), Latitude 10 turns ... turns Latitude 10 ... into a fully functional x86 machine - just connect the tablet to the dock - station and connect peripheral equipment: monitor, keyboard and mouse type "mouse". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c43/828/d30/c43828d301dd9c821bc3e7c2f06fe3f9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Of course, this “Mouse” cannot be connected, but there are many other models!</i>  <i>And not only USB, you can and Bluetooth.</i>

      Then everything depends on the fantasy and software requirements, network administrators will take care of the rest, since it’s not a problem for them, but it’s a little further.  It turns out such a universal solution for employees of large (or not so) enterprises, for employees who, in addition to sufficient productivity, need mobility and universality.  For example, medical workers or intelligence geologists or, to be ashamed, employees of the educational industry, energy, customs officers, postal workers (by the way, if our tablet helps one very well-known mail to become better (and it can), we will only happy!).  And, most importantly, it is important to understand that Latitude 10 is not a “toy for tops” at all, as many are used to thinking when it comes to any tablet computer, it is a full-fledged working tool that is capable of solving the tasks it sets its owner. <br>  But all this was, if I may say so, “for everyone”, and people of a completely different level are gathering at Habré, and you, of course, are interested in your friends to learn something more substantial about the “device”, isn't it?  Scroll further ... <br><br><h5>  Picture Two: practical </h5><br>  Above, we mentioned the abbreviation "PC" in the meaning of "personal computer", with reference to Latitude 10, take it as an axiom, okay?  You can even quote the words of Sergey Vilyanov mentioned above: <i>“For the first time in my life, I had a real computer in my hands, on which you can not only consume content, but also create it fully.</i>  <i>At the same time, it weighs 660 grams and runs on battery for up to 10 hours.</i>  <i>And no fans inside</i> . <br><br>  Based on the fact that Latitude 10 is a personal computer that runs on a full-fledged Windows 8, it is subject to the same laws that apply to regular desktops, laptops and ultrabooks that exist within the organization’s network.  This removes most of the problems of integration into the existing architecture, because, in fact, nothing “exotic” or not subject to security policies is introduced into the network.  Again, working network scripts to connect disks or msi-installers VPN connections, or installing the necessary software for authorization in the network (some EDMS or Firewall client) and network printers now work correctly, and users have access to the necessary resources , and admins have one less headache.  Here it is necessary to mention that the process of buying software for a tablet is identical;  again, on ordinary PCs, an organization can legitimately use already existing licenses that were previously purchased.  Many customers are faced with the problems of purchasing software in the App Store and Google Play for a corporate account (in the case of these online stores, no one will invoice for accounting, you need to come up with some tricky scheme, which is especially inconvenient when you need to equip several hundred tablets with software ). <br><br>  Laziness, you know, the engine of progress.  Let this saying not always be relevant, but reducing the number of unnecessary movements with this or that new piece of hardware in the network is reducing the costs of its integration and maintenance!  Moreover, for administrators of corporate windows-networks, of which the majority, whatever one may say, Dell Latitude 10 is also suitable as a “workhorse”: to steer users in AD, to twist server roles, to deploy corporate anti-virus (and not only) software or to add / Remove MMC snap - you can.  There is also command line support for fans of Power Shell-hardcore!  :) <br><br>  Win- <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/download/details.aspx%3Fid%3D28972">admin</a> note: here is a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/download/details.aspx%3Fid%3D28972">link to the Admin Tools for Windows 8</a> . <br><br>  Again, being on a business trip or in the country, there is no need to call a colleague who is at home “at the company” or at work, with the words: “Mikhalych, help me out, you need to create five accounts and include them in OU = VPNUsers, and then raise Routing and Remote Access on the eighth server!  Take configs from server5, just change the addressing, ”- all this can be done by yourself.  You can monitor the load itself, the status of servers, turn on and off (anything can happen) using iDRAC or via RDC / PowerShell.  This description could be continued for a long time, because each win-administrator has “his own” tasks, we think that they can be solved without any problems on Latitude 10. The main thing is to work in a win-environment just like before on the usual PC, but with +100 mobility.  Imagine an admin who can right in your workplace “stick” his tablet into the dock (until yours is removed) and perform the necessary manipulations, or he, from, say, Thailand, sets up your new PC at your request (guess which one? ) or deploy a new software product on the desired computers in the organization. <br><br>  <i>The lyrical digression is the first: we, of course, do not recommend using this hint, but not sharing it would mean that we are not completely frank.</i>  <i>Not enough features of the Pro version and you want to take advantage of DirectAccess?</i>  <i>Then you need to install Windows 8 Enterprise on Latitude 10!</i>  <i>How?</i>  <i><a href="http://nuttyrat.blogspot.ru/2013/01/installing-windows-8-enterprise-on-dell.html">Everything is quite simple</a> .</i> <br><br>  What other positive things are there in the Latitude 10 computer for the user or admin?  Well, for example, the presence of USB 2.0 in the case of the device - you can fully work with flash drives and usb-keys, there is a version with built-in (not "suspended") support for smart card authentication. <br><br>  Now about the introduction, there are a couple of interesting points.  It is clear that a single management of all devices is supported, through, for example, Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) or <a href="http://www.kace.com/">Dell KACE</a> - this is an integral part of a good product and an additional advantage to the manufacturer, and the admins again with a minus-headache with fleet management. .  Even for customers, Dell has the option of creating a single image of the device and "pouring" this image right at the factory, followed by delivery to the buyer of a ready-to-use device - turned on and work!  There is a similar option, of course, for Latitude 10 - it's the same PC, remember?  And then you certainly ask: “Is it possible to install another OS on it?  How? ”, But not everything is as“ smooth ”as many would like: the device has its own UFI BIOS, which is designed specifically for Windows 8 - other operating systems are not supported by the manufacturer. <br><br>  <i>The lyrical digression is the second: From very reliable sources, we know that one customer company managed to install something like a Linux-like OS on Dell Latitude 10, but by what means this was achieved and how many system programmers were ten years older, we not known.</i>  <i>The guarantee, by the way, after such “dances with a tambourine”, of course, ceases to act.</i> <br><br>  In addition to OS restrictions, there is one more important requirement that must be fulfilled before sending your image “to the factory” - Dell must receive a letter of eligibility from the software manufacturer that the customer has a license right to use This product is in its goal and can be preinstalled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e70/c03/a5a/e70c03a5a0b72a0d47fbd372527fedf5.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Here is a very <a href="http://www.principledtechnologies.com/Dell/Latitude_10_enterprise.pdf">interesting study</a> conducted by Principled Technologies in January 2013, the comparison was made with, do not be afraid of the word, one of the best tablets on the planet Earth - Apple iPad, but in a corporate environment.</i> <br><br>  But this is not the whole iceberg!  Due to the fact that Latitude 10 is a PC, all possible support and maintenance programs and, of course, guarantees apply to it.  The guarantees should be noted separately, the moment is important and profitable: do not confuse the Latitude 10 with the “household” tablets, to which everyone is so accustomed, the “household” warranty applies to the “household” tablets.  The tablet has a full-fledged warranty program, which includes the NBD (Next Business Day) or ProSupport level program, which comes with a three-year warranty for the device “by default”, a corporate warranty, with all the advantages that come from it, including a specialist visit to the customer and repair directly to place  It all depends on what package you purchase. <br><br>  Speaking about the capabilities of the device in work, guarantees for it and support programs, we somehow completely forgot to mention security, and this is one of the cornerstones in the modern world where the network rules everywhere.  Mobile devices tend to get lost, everyone who is not clean on a hand loves to attach legs to them and, in the end, the notorious industrial espionage still exists!  Immediately we will discuss 2 options: if the device is connected to a virtual machine on the server, then it is logical that there is essentially nothing to lose, except for the PC itself, but if any data is locally stored on it (a more frequent option), then protection is necessary and desirable not "virtual", it is, as they say, a priori!  What can offer Latitude 10?  First, there is a component of the <a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/555/vsl-absolute">Computrace</a> system, which allows you to remotely “erase” the device as soon as it “appears in the radar view,” or, alternatively, the device simply sends its coordinates — via 3G or GPRS, you can assemble a rescue team on tinted cars and go to the rescue of "pills" and data!  There are also configurations with the <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/atom-z2760-business-tablets-brief.pdf">Intel Platform Trust Technology</a> with smart card support and a built-in fingerprint scanner with the ability to “close” both the BIOS and just the system boot.  Here we also add the presence of Dell protective cover for the device, as well as the port for Noble Lock, - not the most significant, but quite necessary accessories! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c6/c29/045/5c6c29045ae48e334fef7861ff41d4b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What else have we forgotten?  Battery!  The battery here is removable and is available in two versions - 2 cells and 4. The 4-cell variant is literally a few millimeters thicker, but it gives a significant increase in the time it takes to work from it.  Of course, you will ask: “What is the operating time?” The answer is: the operating time depends strongly on the working style, but, on average, it is 8 hours from a two-cell battery. <br>  The only "fly in the ointment" is that there is no separate battery charger, you will have to charge it directly through the device, and nothing is known about the possible output of such a "gadget" -charging, unfortunately. <br><br><h5>  Scene Three: Final </h5><br>  Dell believes in the future of such devices, and the company's engineers are closely involved in the development of more powerful versions that will be based on Intel Core i5 series processors, which will drastically change the performance level of the device.  Yes, and memory, most likely, will add, which also sometimes is not enough, but here it is, rather, in the OS.  We are also very much looking forward to Windows 8.1, which should fix the situation with the flaws of the previous version.  Microsoft is a multinational corporation with a very large bag of operating system knowledge, and we are confident that 8.1 will bring many, many positive changes that will benefit all of us.  With all the positive aspects of the Latitude 10, it should be noted that the Intel Atom Z2760 is still sometimes unable to perform the amount of tasks that the device user is setting before it, especially for “heavy sites” like facebook, which eat off a good chunk memory and processor time, while hanging in the background, or some really "tight" documents that do not always open correctly on the desktop. <br><br>  What else would you like?  It would be very nice to get a keyboard dock, which would also expand the set of interfaces (like the docking station) and carry one more battery, as an option.  And, it is believed that such a keyboard will soon be released.  Add here also the possibility not to disconnect the USB case while the Latitude 10 is in the dock and, if you are already impudent, the more powerful video subsystem so that you can connect two full-fledged monitors.  Well, time will tell, at least, the tendency of the company's development in the direction of the tablets is clearly visible, and one can’t wait to see new devices.  It's only the beginning! <br><br>  A bit of video, as a final chord: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uKTCk7cx4Ps&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhha-u8of2j1gXkK-1MbNCIy-Uzm7g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PS Almost forgot!  On our facebook page, we <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Dell.CIS/app_208146089345432">launched a 3D showroom</a> where Latitude 10 can be viewed from all angles and learn some additional details about it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190592/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190592/</a></p>
