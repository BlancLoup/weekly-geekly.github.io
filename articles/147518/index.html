  <section class="page js-page"><h1>FuelPHP year after 1.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The first release of <a href="http://fuelphp.com/">FuelPHP</a> , to be honest, was not particularly remarkable and did not stand out from the line of other frameworks.  Even for me, a man who had managed to master only CI and Kohana by that time, the unremarkableness of the first version was obvious.  But there was something and that in this young project was fascinating.  This ‚Äúsomething‚Äù, oddly enough, was hope.  Hope that Fuel will still flourish with the necessary functionality that will be fueled by fresh ideas. <br>  The first release was a fusion of ideas CodeIgniter, Kohana, Rails and 9 months of work, more than forty developers.  Since then, a year has passed, what did its developers spend on and what was their project?  About this thing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  About functionality </h5><br>  Functional changed and really met expectations.  I will not enumerate all the functionality or retell the documentation of the current version 1.2.1, but will only focus on the most important thing: <br>  - Oil.  The so-called <a href="http://fuelphp-framework.ru/packages/oil/intro.html">Oil package</a> allows you to run your own or embedded tasks from the command line, generate admin panel, start database migrations, and perform interactive debugs. <br>  - Controllers.  There are four classes of them, this is the <a href="http://fuelphp-framework.ru/general/controllers/base.html">base</a> class, then the <a href="http://fuelphp-framework.ru/general/controllers/template.html">controller for templating</a> , the <a href="http://fuelphp-framework.ru/general/controllers/rest.html">controller for building the API,</a> and a hybrid of the two latter.  Also, I was very pleased with the presence of the built-in before () and after () methods - this is very convenient. <br>  - Improved <a href="http://fuelphp-framework.ru/general/security.html">security</a> filtering. <br>  - The <a href="http://fuelphp-framework.ru/packages/orm/intro.html">ORM</a> (OOP approach when working with databases) was significantly expanded and improved.  <a href="http:">Added</a> support for <a href="http:">noSQL</a> database. <br>  - User <a href="http://fuelphp-framework.ru/packages/auth/intro.html">authentication</a> , group privilege separation and ACL (Access Control List or ACL - access control list) appeared. <br>  - Many people use in their work some kind of one template engine and got used to it, be it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smarty">Smarty</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twig">Twig</a> or another.  Especially so that you can continue to work with a familiar tool without problems, the developers have added the <a href="http://docs.fuelphp.com/packages/parser/intro.html">Parser</a> package. <br><br><h5>  About spiritual </h5><br>  The project does not consist only of lines of code, there is something more, something that guides the overall development process - spirit or soul, as philosophers would call it. <br>  The spirit of the project according to my observations is the mobility of the project and loyalty to the ideas that were laid in Fuel and are its essence.  The length of time from the idea to its implementation in the project is very small.  It is worth mentioning that the number of developers has a positive effect on the speed of development.  Now there are about a hundred including leading developers. <br>  The project led and heads up <a href="http://dhorrigan.com/">Dan Horrigan</a> .  In 2011, he held about two dozen events on the topic of FuelPHP and plans to hold the same amount.  He shares on them: information about the framework, plans for the future and answers questions.  At the Offsite FuelPHP developers are conducting a survey about what we want to see in the framework.  In the west, the framework continues to gain popularity.  There is an active community and a support <a href="http://fuelphp.com/forums">forum</a> , where it has not once received comprehensive answers to its questions.  In general, and then hopes were justified. <br><br><h5>  About impressions </h5><br>  A few months ago, began to develop Fuel.  The framework is very flexible and convenient.  You can build a complex architecture and implement it without any problems, and the framework will really help you. <br>  During mastering it was hard to understand the English documentation, so I decided to translate it, and later I posted it to the network.  I supplemented my <a href="http://fuelphp-framework.ru/features.html">version of the documentation</a> with examples and explanations where it was really needed.  Some sections provided video inserts, sometimes it's better to see once than read a hundred times.

For beginners, I would recommend starting with him, and those who have been experienced do not need my recommendations. <br>  That's all, all the success and early implementation of plans. <br><br>  <a href="http://fuelphp.com/">Offsite FuelPHP</a> - <a href="http://fuelphp.com/">fuelphp.com</a> <br>  FuelPHP on GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/fuel">github.com/fuel</a> <br>  Test CMS on GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/samitrimal/mod-cms">github.com/samitrimal/mod-cms</a> <br>  Cheat Sheet - <a href="http://www.novius-os.org/fuelphp-cheatsheet/index.htm%3Futm_source%3Dnovli%26utm_medium%3Dnovli%26utm_campaign%3Dfuelphp-cheatsheet">www.novius-os.org/fuelphp-cheatsheet/index.htm?utm_source=novli&amp;utm_medium=novli&amp;utm_campaign=fuelphp-cheatsheet</a> <br>  Russian documentation - <a href="http://fuelphp-framework.ru/">fuelphp-framework.ru</a> <br>  Community in vk.com - <a href="http://vk.com/fuelphp">vk.com/fuelphp</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147518/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147518/</a></p>
