Weave today are equipped with quad-core processors, RAM also allows a lot, and disk capacity is not a problem at all.  Especially since Windows can now work on ARM platforms.  I travel a lot and have always dreamed of carrying my ‚Äúnative‚Äù system unit with me.  But he is a bit heavy. <br><br>  I am not a fan of the aforementioned companies, but whatever one may say, I have to use Windows, since there are some programs that neither Linux (Ubuntu, Android), nor Mac (OS X, iOS) can open.

      Nokia is in turmoil now.  At the MWC 2012 exhibition, they could not think of anything, except for attaching a 41 megapixel camera to the telephone.  Plus, instead of coming up with <nobr>something</nobr> sensible, the new designer of the company is sitting around and calling names on the market leaders: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  Nokia's chief designer said the Apple iOS user interface on the iPhone is too weak and confused.  "The road from the kitchen to the dining room always runs through the main entrance," he said about the product of one of the largest competitors.  However, he described the Android operating system as a ‚Äúdollhouse‚Äù with furniture that you can take and rearrange.  <a href="http://3dnews.ru/news/626384">3dnews.ru/news/626384</a> <br></blockquote><br>  Let's return to the topic.  Everyone loves to customize the OS for themselves, everyone has some specific programs, convenient location of files and shortcuts, interface settings and working environment.  It remains to save all this and put it in your pocket so as not to reconfigure every computer. <br><br>  Imagine this picture: morning, sit at home, in a comfortable chair, have a cup of coffee while working at the computer.  At hand, all the delights of the desktop PC, such as: large monitors, keyboards, mice, and finally, favorite programs that can not be fully used on hundreds. <br><br>  And here we must go.  Fortunately, the OS you have started from the phone.  You pull out the weave from the docking stand, and all the work is in your hands, you don't even need to close anything.  True, with a <nobr>4-inch</nobr> screen you can hardly do <nobr>anything</nobr> in InDesign, and other similar programs for layout, but all other programs can be quite normally used on a mobile. <br><br>  And the computer restarts, but from a real system unit.  That is, your wife and children can use a home computer with the settings that are convenient for them. <br><br>  You go to work with peace of mind.  Along the way, you are writing something or completing a presentation, when how.  Arriving at work, connect your phone to your work computer, run your programs in a familiar interface, so productivity increases. <br><br>  Even if you urgently need to fly to Africa, all the work in your hands.  By the way, I am writing this post from Africa. <br><br>  Of course, some will say that Dropbox solves a problem with files.  But, alas, he still does not solve the problem with the interface settings. <br><br>  PS This is not an advertisement of the aforementioned companies, on the contrary, I am surprised at their policies and believe that if they are not, then someone should do it. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141118/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141118/</a></p>
