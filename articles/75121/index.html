  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Inviter - Invites Exchange</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a title="Invitee exchange" href="http://www.inviter.ru/"><img src="http://s1.inviter.ru/i/bnr/bnr_283x105-wh.png" alt="image"></a> <br>  I think most of you, dear readers, do not need to explain what invitations are, what they are for, and what works sometimes are worth making them.  Newly habra-users will not allow to lie ... The concept of invites is a good way to form a high-quality audience and minimize the impact on the resource of different inadequacies.  But at the same time, limited registration greatly complicates the lives of people who seek to join the community with the best intentions.  So how can you earn a precious invite with a little blood? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Everything is changing! </h3><br>  The most interesting thing is that the ratio of people who are looking for invites and users who own these invites and are willing to share is not unique.  For the same GoogleWave, for example, the supply is four and a half times the demand.  Some have so many invites in their hands that they don‚Äôt know where to put them, and the seekers, meanwhile, continue to interview friends and acquaintances in search of invitations.  And what if you bring together both categories of users, help them find each other? <br><br> <a title="Home page" href="http://www.inviter.ru/"><img src="http://makepreview.com/userimages/71/browser-1-1710304235-1.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  I had this question more than a year ago when I decided to start developing an <a href="http://www.inviter.ru/">automated invitee exchange service</a> .  The system is extremely simple - fill in the profile lists of available invitations and indicate the sites where I would like to go.  And then it's a matter of time - other users track the appearance of the desired invite and offer something interesting to you in return.

      <br>
      Omitting the details of six months of attempts to work on the service with freelancers, and another six months of self-development (I can tell you about it in a separate post, if you're interested), I can say that I didn‚Äôt lose it by finishing the job.  Two weeks after launch, the service found about a thousand new users and four thousand different invitations.  For the same time, users of the service received a total of 370 invites. <br><br> <a title="Top popular sites" href="http://www.inviter.ru/sites"><img src="http://makepreview.com/userimages/85/browser-1-1851856350-1.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Honestly, I‚Äôm not an innovator in the field of distribution of invites, and even at the time <a href="http://www.inviter.ru/">Inviter was</a> just thinking of analogs, it seems that they already existed.  But, in my opinion, they have a significant drawback - you can‚Äôt change invites.  You come to the profile of the site you are interested in, stand in a queue and wait for the weather by the sea (to put it simply, wait for the turn to invite to number 100500).  Interaction with invites owners is minimized. <br><br>  During this time, by the way, the domestic copy of InviteShare has appeared, which, unfortunately, is also a little more than completely sad both in terms of concept and in terms of implementing user interaction logic. <br><br> <a title="Invites to Habr" href=""><img src="http://makepreview.com/userimages/25/browser-1-1255689901-1.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h3>  Among other things </h3><br>  I have already said that it is not necessary to change an invite to an invite, but you can still try to get invitations without even offering anything in return?  So, I say! <br><br>  But this is not important.  It is also important that the service does not go past developers of closed resources, who, for example, would like to organize regular releases and accounting of invites from their own sites.  I can see from my eyes that this is exactly what the creators of <a href="http://zombobox.com/">zombobox.com</a> have always lacked, even I cannot get to them for more than a year already: D <br><br>  Of course, the focus was directly on the possibility of sharing exchanges between users, but the component for developers will be developed and improved to provide extensive information about applicants.  In general, its task is to help the creators of closed resources to know their potential users, let's say, in person. <br><br><img title="Exchange page" src="http://makepreview.com/userimages/93/browser-1-1937663561-1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I hope I'm not too tired of you with my opus.  Of course, the service will continue to grow with various sweets and be polished.  Therefore, I would very much like to organize in this post a feedback with the people who were inspired by the service, but it seems to them that there are points that can be improved. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75121/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75121/</a></p>
