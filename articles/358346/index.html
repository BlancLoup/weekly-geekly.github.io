  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"You can make your products on imported machines, from which it will not become less domestic"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Suddenly, my <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/299423/">previous post about a new plant in Kursk</a> caused a heated discussion in the comments.  I received a lot of questions about production, which I, as an outside observer, cannot answer, but I also consider it to be ignored.  Therefore, I decided to redirect the most acute of them to the head of production of this plant.  And that's what he answered. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Questions from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/mike_soft/" class="user_link">Mike_soft</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/repisot/" class="user_link">REPISOT</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/bull1251/" class="user_link">bull1251</a> <br>  <b><i>Sergey Sergeevich, what products of microelectronics does your factory produce now?</i></b>  <b><i>When will the production of sensors begin?</i></b> <br><br>  The launch of the production of sensors and microelectronics is scheduled for 2019 - this is phase III of the plant.  To date, only the first stage of the plant is open.

      Questions from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/maxwolf/" class="user_link">maxwolf</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/plm/" class="user_link">plm</a> <br>  <b><i>Tell us more about the sensors.</i></b>  <b><i>Where do they apply?</i></b>  <b><i>And what is the black bulba on cable scraps among high-precision sensors?</i></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v_/wf/ss/v_wfssasbsrjn2aejjhuunmc8wu.jpeg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Sensors today are used almost everywhere: in airplanes, cars, in production.  Yes, what really go far, in every smartphone today there are sensors.  The same tilt sensor that turns your screen. <br><br>  "Black Bulba", which was written in the comments, is a module for measuring the parameters of power lines.  Inside is our inclinometer.  In the case of sagging wire, it transmits the corresponding signal to the control system.  Electrical networks, by the way, have already appreciated this development. <br>  We also plan to produce motion sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc.), pressure, microgenerators, mirrors, microphones, and other products. <br><br>  Question from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/dmitriy62/" class="user_link">Dmitriy62</a> <br>  <b><i>How do you manage to compete with the Chinese (in the production of electronics)?</i></b>  <b><i>What are your competitive advantages?</i></b>  <b><i>Or do you work only on state order for the defense industry?</i></b> <br><br>  Compete with the Chinese is impossible, we just work in its segment.  Yes, we carry out orders for defense enterprises.  But not only.  As I have already said, the private market is also interested in working with Russian manufacturers.  For example, we manufacture products for the automotive industry, railway and air transport, telecommunications, etc. <br><br>  Questions from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/ems/" class="user_link">EMS</a> <br>  <b><i>Why does an enterprise that manufactures LED lamps and cash registers need a tomograph?</i></b> <br><br>  Why does a person who has a computer need a pen?  They are for different tasks.  In addition, the main activity of our company is not lamps, and not cash registers, but the production of test, process and test equipment.  A tomograph is one of the ways to control product quality.  It allows you to see the internal structure of the sample, assess the quality of the assembly, casting, welded and soldered joints.  You can see if there are defects, cracks, pores, inclusions.  In Russia today, the need for computed tomography services, especially considering the development of additive technologies, is only growing every year.  And we provide these services. <br><br>  <b><i>Why is there so much money on a tomograph in the country, and milling machines are so cheap?</i></b> <br><br>  Again, it all depends on what they are used for.  We are not a turning and milling enterprise, which stamps a thousand parts per shift.  We have other tasks, these machines are mainly used for repair work and ensuring the internal needs of the enterprise.  A full machining workshop will be launched later - tentatively at the end of this year.  There will be the production of body parts of products from sheet metal, metalworking and powder coating of buildings. <br><br>  <b><i>What kind of certification does the production have?</i></b> <br><br>  In 2017, we successfully passed the recertification for compliance with the requirements of GOST R ISO 9001: 2015 (ISO 9001: 2015).  Now a package of documents is being prepared for the certification of production according to the standards ISO 13485 (Quality Standard of Medical Products) and ISO / TS 16949 (Automotive Industry). <br><br>  <b><i>The fact that moisture-sensitive parts are stored in special cabinets is good.</i></b>  <b><i>And everything else?</i></b>  <b><i>Solder paste?</i></b>  <b><i>How will the equipment feel without air conditioning?</i></b> <br><br>  Solder paste is stored in the refrigerator at a temperature of + 5 ... 10 ¬∞ C. <br>  We maintain normal temperature in our workshops and, accordingly, the equipment works without interruption. <br><br>  Questions from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/soviettwins/" class="user_link">SovietTwins</a> <br>  <b><i>How stable is the temperature in the shops?</i></b> <br><br>  The temperature is stable, keeps, according to the set modes of the climatic equipment (heating, cooling). <br><br>  <b><i>Are there heat curtains?</i></b> <br>  Air heating is used only in building number 7 (motor area).  In the other buildings, a closed heating system is used, with the installation of gas boilers in each building. <br><br>  <b><i>Is it hot in summer?</i></b>  <b><i>What is the air conditioning system in the shops?</i></b> <br>  No, there are air conditioners installed in the rooms (split systems), last summer the temperature in the buildings did not rise above 24 degrees.  People were even cold. <br>  Industrial production VRV systems are installed in production buildings. <br><br>  Some more questions from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/ems/" class="user_link">EMS</a> <br>  <b><i>Are ESD protection only bathrobes and shoes?</i></b>  <b><i>And the floor, furniture, tools?</i></b> <br><br>  In addition to bathrobes, hats, boot covers and slippers, we have floors in workshops, furniture and tools also have ESD protection.  An ESD audit is regularly conducted. <br><br>  <b><i>Does the company have a stove for drying boards?</i></b> <br><br>  There is. <br><br>  Questions from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/impetus/" class="user_link">impetus</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/sova13/" class="user_link">SOvA13</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/mike_soft/" class="user_link">Mike_soft</a> <br>  <b><i>Is there enough space for parking / loading / unloading / reversing a heavy load?</i></b>  <b><i>Will the fire truck pass by?</i></b> <br><br>  Naturally, the design of the plant took into account all the necessary sites for parking / loading / unloading vehicles.  And how do you think the equipment is brought to the plant?  The same tomograph weighs 8.5 tons and has dimensions of 2.7 mx 1.8m x 2.2m (plus packaging).  Of course, for the delivery and shipment of such equipment we need the appropriate areas and access roads.  All this is provided and is designed for the future. <br><br>  The modular architecture of the plant is also not chosen by chance.  Firstly, it allows reducing vibration, secondly, it is done for fire safety reasons, thirdly, such a system is easier to manage. <br><br>  Question from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/nubus/" class="user_link">Nubus</a> <br>  <b><i>Why are ‚Äúdry storage cabinets‚Äù so expensive?</i></b> <br><br>  A modern dry storage cabinet is not a metal box with a compressor and air / nitrogen supply.  This equipment is an automated dry storage system with a significant electronic component.  All structural parts of dry storage cabinets are antistatic and guarantee complete protection of the products placed in them against static electricity, while the dust- and moisture-proof welded construction provides IP 65 protection against external influences. <br><br>  The system conforms to all requirements for storage and operating conditions of radio elements, according to Russian and international standards (IPC / JEDEC J-STD 033, GOST 21493-76, GOST 15150-69, GOST 23216-78) <br><br>  Question from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/aewoo/" class="user_link">aewoo</a> <br>  <b><i>It is very good that in Russia at least something is beginning to emerge from modern industries.</i></b>  <b><i>Question to the author.</i></b>  <b><i>The manufacture of cabinets and printed circuit boards is understandable.</i></b>  <b><i>And whose components?</i></b>  <b><i>the machines there you can see whose ...</i></b> <b><br></b> <br>  Now in the world is globalization.  These components can be developed by one company and made by another.  The so-called fabless products.  Therefore, I would not focus on whose components it is.  Basically, of course, foreign.  But it‚Äôs like with machines - you can make your products, but on imported machines.  From this it will not be less domestic. <br><br><hr><br>  Due to the fact that the time of our meeting with the production manager was limited, I could not ask all the questions that were sent in the comments.  But he answered the main ones, although, to be honest, the reaction was different.  In general, I hope this was not our last meeting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358346/</a></p>
