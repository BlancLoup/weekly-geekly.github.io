According to statistics, 70% of fraud in the market of EMV-cards are CNP fraud.  How exactly does a DCV solution protect CPN operations? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f33/c0b/c10/f33c0bc10ecf4684a274bc31b489b78e.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Dynamic code verification from Gemalto is a transaction protection solution without a card (CNP), the parameters of which are set by the issuing bank and includes three main elements - a payment card with a display, a mobile device solution and a confirming server.  This configuration allows banks to minimize the likelihood of fraud without compromising the convenience of making purchases on the Internet. <br><br>  In 2013, 41.3% 1 of the total number of Internet users worldwide bought goods online.  As expected, in 2017 this figure will increase to 46.4%.  With the increase in online purchases and increased protection of transactions with the physical presentation of the card, fraud in making payments predictably shifts towards the next (most attractive for attackers and, at the same time, the weakest) chain link - transactions without presenting a card (CNP operations).  The total amount of fraudulent transactions carried out using cards issued in the Single European Payment Space (SEPA) and acquired throughout the world amounted to 1.44 billion euros2 in 2013, which is 8% more than in 2012. <br><br>  The main factor behind this growth was fraud in CNP operations, which in 2013 accounted for losses amounting to 958 million euros.

      That is why the prevention of fraud in CNP operations and the prevention of such crimes becomes a prerequisite for preserving the universality and convenience of online shopping. <br><br><h2>  Buyers want to make online purchases convenient </h2><br>  Most consumers understand the need for security, but they also want to make online purchases as much as possible. <br>  comfortable.  According to statistics, on average, 68.53% of transactions are incomplete: buyers stop the process of making a purchase if it is too complicated or takes too much time. <br><br><h2>  Issuers want to minimize changes to existing infrastructure </h2><br>  The increase in fraud incites banks and shops to implement solutions for authentication using 3D Secure technology.  At the same time, such solutions do not fit well in the payment infrastructure and are not always popular among consumers. <br><br><h2>  Gemalto Dynamic Code Verification (DCV) Solution Package </h2><br>  The Dynamic Code Verification Package offered by Gemalto is a comprehensive solution for securing CNP operations based on the use of a payment card with a display, a mobile application and a confirming server.

This code, valid for a limited time, excludes the use of stolen static card data by criminals for fraudulent transactions. <br><br>  In addition, Gemalto's DCV solution allows card issuers to reduce the risk of fraud without changing the online payment infrastructure of online stores and payment systems. <br><br>  <b>Optelio DCV</b> is a classic contact or contactless payment card of the EMV standard, on the back side of which a dynamic code is displayed.  This code automatically changes over time without the participation of the cardholder. <br><br>  <b>The Ezio DCV mobile solution</b> allows your customers to store their cards and read dynamic codes on their mobile phone.  At the request of users, the application can be protected by a PIN-code, which gives it an additional level of authentication protection.  This solution allows you to safely make purchases. <br>  online using the maps stored in it and using the DCV feature. <br><br>  <b>The Ezio DCV Server</b> stores all information related to users, maps and devices.  This server confirms the dynamic codes generated by the card or mobile solution, and sends the result to the authorization node. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eAsH4zqQ-9s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  Dynamic code verification using Gemalto technology </h1><br><br><h2>  Benefits for card issuers </h2><br>  <b>Enhanced security.</b>  Gemalto's DCV technology is a real breakthrough in the international fight against CNP fraud, which allows you to protect CNP transactions, which now cease to be a weak link in the card payment business. <br><br>  <b>Reduce fraud incidence and fraud loss.</b>  The proposed solution helps issuers to immediately put an end to fraud and reduce the costs associated with countering the CNP fraud (in particular, with regard to the work of the call center, claims settlement and re-issuance of cards). <br><br>  <b>Ease of implementation.</b>  The DCV solution is focused on the issuer: the latter has complete control over the implementation;  there is no need to involve online stores or acquiring banks in the integration process. <br><br>  All components - the map, the mobile application and the server are fully integrated;  confirmation server is implemented in accordance with standard components <br>  IT infrastructure.  All this guarantees the ease of integrating Gemalto's DCV solution into any existing payment architecture. <br><br>  <b>Freedom of choice.</b>  Issuers have the ability to deploy the solution only on the map, only as a mobile application, or use a combination of both.
