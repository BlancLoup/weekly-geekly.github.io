      <b>How did you come to work on Ruby?</b> <br><br>  Probably, like many other developers, I came to Ruby through RubyOnRails.  I was struck by the simplicity of the language and the capabilities of the framework.  At that time, and it was 2010-2011, Rails 2.x was in full bloom.  Before Ruby, I was involved in web development on .Net and a new language for me was a breath of fresh air, immersion in fairy tale and RoR magic.  Another significant factor was that the Ruby ecosystem was constantly growing - new libraries and various solutions appeared that simplified application development. <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite programming language after Ruby, why him?</b> <br><br>  There are languages ‚Äã‚Äãin which I write work projects, there are languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat I use in personal projects.  Ruby is still my workhorse and is the main language in the projects I participate in.  My hobbies in other languages ‚Äã‚Äãare mostly spontaneous - if I see that some language is beginning to gain popularity, it is always interesting for me to meet him.  Therefore, it is difficult to choose any one.  At one point in time, I admired Go (a fairly simple language), with the advent of Rust, my attention turned to him.  Now I pay great attention to functional languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Racket and Clojure. <br><br><br>  <b>What was the last thing you learned from the world of web development?</b> <br><br>  For me, this is a rather abstract question - every day I learn something new.  Moreover - I am sure that after RailsClub I will leave with a decent baggage of knowledge.  Over this past year, the vector in frontend development has changed for me.  I made a great discovery for myself in the form of Reactjs and the entire reactive programming paradigm. <br><br><br>  <b>What is missing in Rails?</b> <br><br>  The answer to this question I voiced at the very beginning of his speech.  I hope everyone will be interested. <br><br><br>  <b>What is open source for you?</b>  <b>What projects are you participating in and why?</b> <br><br>  OpenSource for me is a whole world, free and open to everyone.  This is a huge community of developers, people and a storehouse of knowledge.  This world allows us, developers, to share with each other ideas, knowledge, improve the quality of their work and help others to do something better. <br>  I try to make a contribution to the development of OpenSource.  I often correct bugs in the libraries I use, and I also spread some of the ideas to the public. <br><br><br>  <b>Best read book on programming / technology?</b> <br><br>  There are several of them.  I can distinguish three of them - this is " <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a> " (Martin Fowler), " <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321125215/domainlanguag-20">Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity of the Heart of Software</a> " (Eric Evans) and " <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> " by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman. <br><br><br>  <b>What advice would you give to developers who want to achieve great success?</b> <br><br>  Read more specialized literature, follow trends in the IT world (not only development, but also neighboring areas, DevOps, QA).  Engage in self-education. <br><br><br>  <b>Who wanted to be in childhood?</b> <br><br>  Since childhood, I wanted to do programming, my first computer was the ZX Spectrum, collected by my father from the diagrams in some kind of magazine, and the first toy was written in Basic (runaway races).  I went to this profession from my very childhood. <br><br><br>  <b>Not tired of programming?</b> <br><br>  No, and I think it will not happen soon - I live and breathe it at work and often even outside working hours. <br><br><br>  <b>What would you do if you had 2 months of free paid time?</b> <br><br>  I would spend most of this time relaxing with my family.  We sometimes live only in work and forget that there are people who love us and want attention. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview!</b> <br><br>  At the conference, Alexander will give a talk on the Ruby Object Mapper (ROM), an experimental Ruby library for realizing the display of ‚Äúclean‚Äù Ruby objects, which allows using all the power of the selected data storage without any restrictions. <br><br>  ROM is based on several concepts different from the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Ruby ORM.  Sasha will talk about these concepts, analyze the features of the library and show how to live without Active Record. <br><br>  <b>Interesting?</b>  <b>Come to <a href="http://railsclub.ru/">RailsClub</a> !</b> <br><br><h4>  Our sponsors </h4><br>  General partner: <b><a href="http://www.toptal.com/">Toptal</a></b> <br>  Gold Partners: <b><a href="https://cloudcastle.ru/">Cloud Castle</a></b> and <a href="http://npoprogress.com/"><b>Progress</b></a> <br>  Silver Partners: <b><a href="http://www.at-consulting.ru/">AT-Consulting</a></b> , <b><a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a></b> , <b><a href="http://www.insales.ru/page/vacancy-ruby-on-rails">InSales</a></b> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/"><b>JetBrains</b></a> <br>  Bronze Partners: <b><a href="http://rambler-co.ru/">Rambler &amp; Co</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.lookatme.ru/">Look at Media</a></b> <br><br>  Stay up to date with our news by subscribing to the newsletter on the website railsclub.ru, and stay tuned for updates: <br>  <a href="http://railsclub.ru/">RailsClub.ru</a> <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/railsclub_ru">twitter.com/railsclub_ru</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/railsclub">facebook.com/railsclub</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267151/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267151/</a></p>
