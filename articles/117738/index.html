  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Pirate Bay promotes new file sharing service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b4fba789/873a58ba/731def61/8795d7a6.jpg"><br><br>  We must think that the administration of The Pirate Bay successfully opposes the right holders and their lawsuits.  I remember that on April 1, the news was published that the unfortunate administration of the service, which was being poisoned on all sides, plans to sell The Pirate Bay to the same right holders to ‚Äúwhiten‚Äù the service.  It is clear that this is only a joke, in which, nevertheless, many naive readers believe.  The news that appeared yesterday is quite a serious one.  So, The Pirate Bay is now promoting a new file-sharing service, which is a hybrid of several file-sharing platforms at once.  At the same time, as always, there is a possibility that the new service, called <a href="http://tubeplus.me/">Tube +</a> , will interest not only file-sharing fans, but also the right holders.  Anyway, but Tube + is something new. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  This service combines several file-sharing platforms at once, plus offers several new services.  In particular, it allows you to watch free movies and TV shows right in your browser.  In addition, Tube + offers links to get files via BitTorrent, eMule, etc.  As far as we know, there were no similar services yet, ‚Äútube plus‚Äù is the first such resource that combines several best (for users) file-sharing technologies.

      The site, according to user feedback, is a bit ‚Äúbuggy‚Äù, and there are several problems with its work, including incorrect links to files.  However, the fact that this service is being promoted by the guys from The Pirate Bay may mean that Tube + will very quickly become popular.  It is now known that Tube + is not available for all countries, but most users get access to the service without any problems. <br><br>  It is known that Tube + is not a project of The Pirate Bay team, but this service, if it is not covered before time, has every chance of becoming no less popular (and maybe more) than The Pirate Bay itself.  In the past few days, only Facebook's Tube + page ‚Äúliked‚Äù more than 10,000 Facebook users, which is to say about the service itself. <br><br>  It is worth noting that Tube + displays IMDb ratings for movies.  In addition, users can search for content by selecting a particular genre or year of film release.  It is also interesting that at first Tube + was located on the .com domain, now the resource has moved to the .me zone.  Probably, this was done so that in a couple of days, instead of the site of the service, the logo of the relevant US special services did not appear with the corresponding inscription, as is often the case with various pirated and not-so sites. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-plugs-hybrid-file-sharing-platform-110417/">torrentfreak</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117738/</a></p>
