  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Transition to binary</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Habr, hello!  Suddenly, my hundredth post crept here and I thought it was time to get to know each other.  I am Schvepsss, but friends call Liza or Lee, I believe in people, artificial intelligence, programmers, and world peace, and I also appreciate moments, literate texts and perfectionism.  If you are reading the news from the Microsoft blog, you probably met my articles.  After much deliberation, I realized that I wanted to dedicate this post to people who are trying to change this world and are doing cool projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9ad/ac8/26c/9adac826c26d4397bc6797090cceafe7.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  No, there will be no texts about heroes of our time, eminent inventors or programmers.  All this you can read without my help. <br><br>  Over the past 99 posts and several dozen articles for various publications written over the past year, I noticed that something interesting is being created in the world every day.  Unfortunately, we often lose sight of this because of the tons of information surrounding us.  Therefore, I want to tell you about 5 projects that hit me, and after that I will share one idea.

    <h2>  "The Next Rembrandt" </h2><br>  The collaboration of technology and art sometimes gives interesting results, as happened last year.  JWT Amsterdam, together with Microsoft, developed the Next Rembrandt project for ING Bank, which was designed to highlight the bank‚Äôs commitment to innovation and support of classical art. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IuygOYZ1Ngo&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi4fjhrPx0nBjSF8glbfeaWlqIRNA"></iframe><br><br>  Initially, 346 authentic Rembrandt paintings were analyzed, of which 168263 image fragments (or 150 GB) were obtained.  Further, with the help of image recognition algorithms, the most typical strokes and geometric patterns of the master were identified, which made it possible to maximize the identity of the style of the future work with the Rembrandt style.  Another interesting point: to give volume to the brush strokes in the picture, it was necessary to analyze the 3D scans of the pictures.  The final data processing took more than 500 hours. <br><br>  Read more about the project <a href="https://vc.ru/p/next-rembrandt">here</a> . <br><br><h2>  Eight-bit VR rhythm music </h2><br>  Uncontrolled raves of the 80s allowed musicians to gain popularity and gather fans around them at the speed of sound.  Over the past 30 years, the situation has changed a lot.  Today, to penetrate the heart of the audience, you need to be something more than just a cool DJ or melodic singer.  Microsoft has a program called Music x Technology, which with technology helps transform music into something tangible. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PMo6NGJ7VQc&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh3ugEcTyCM7OcoIogn7sHuD7jLyA"></iframe><br><br>  In my <a href="http://www.rollingstone.ru/music/article/23933.html">article for Rolling Stone</a> , 6 projects are described, implemented jointly with M83, Childish Gambino, Broods, Grimes, Matthew Dear and Phantogram.  For example, as a result of the work on the first one, the browser game <a href="http://www.meetmeatgo.com/">‚ÄúMeet Me at Go!‚Äù</a> Was released in which the player races for the lost love, moving around the city with a retro-futuristic landscape, collecting items and avoiding obstacles.  It is created on the Unity engine and exported to the UWP platform.  An interesting point that you can notice during the game - the sound effects of the track fully correspond to what is happening on the screen: when the car accelerates, the music also begins to accelerate, and likewise with a slowdown. <br><br><h2>  Face into the keyboard </h2><br>  Microsoft has a research division called Microsoft Research, which has been in existence for more than 25 years.  At the end of last year, they analyzed anonymous data about users' activity on the Internet, in order to understand how the quality of sleep affects the reaction rate of people during the day.  After that, results were obtained based on the analysis of data on the speed of entering search queries and clicking on links in a search engine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6c9/f82/afd/6c9f82afd8b74514be64e8bc594e751d.gif"><br>  <i>Image source <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/drooling-Zk9mW5OmXTz9e">giphy.com</a></i> <br><br>  Microsoft Research has shown that people who have slept two nights in a row for less than six hours experience lethargy over the next six days.  Interesting statistics, in my opinion. <br><br>  Detailed details about this study can be found in the <a href="https://nplus1.ru/material/2017/04/05/microsoft">article</a> . <br><br><h2>  Who are the fusionists </h2><br>  Often, to create something outstanding, a person must go beyond the boundaries of reasonable.  The next article is about Astu Rosway - the man who succeeded.  She developed DuoSkin tattoos for controlling IoT devices, and back in 2011, she became the ideologist of The Printing Dress.  She is also one of the founders of FoodFutures, an exhibition created to solve the problems of urban agriculture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b7d/c60/a66/b7dc60a6678b425eb24b2c1f221ac50b.png"><br><br>  You can read more about her projects at <a href="https://rb.ru/opinion/kto-takie-fuzionisty/">RB</a> , and I want to share a little story that emerged from the results of this material.  Of course, we wanted to "land" these cases in Russian realities, for this we found two people who agreed to comment on the article.  One of them was Oksana Selendeeva, the founder of the CODDY programming school for children.  In our correspondence, even before the release, she admired the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfusionism and she said that she wanted to start courses on this topic.  Then I thought it was just a temporary fuse, but as it turned out later, they really <a href="http://coddyschool.com/courses/517/">appeared</a> .  I do not know how popular they are and whether they will be in demand, but it‚Äôs nice to know that the article about fusionists really inspired someone. <br><br><h2>  Cloud services can save our planet </h2><br>  I often see materials in which there is a discussion ‚ÄúWhat is better: a cloud or a local server?‚Äù Even now, the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dracon134/" class="user_link">dracon134</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/331822">article</a> on this topic hangs in the top.  If we ignore technical problems, there are other topics around cloud platforms that can be argued about.  Ecology is one of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9c1/507/007/9c1507007a4f4efdabd9b71a9a64baee.jpg"><br><br>  In the spring of last year, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/cloud4y/blog/281022/">an article</a> on Habr√© published <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/cloud4y/blog/281022/">an article</a> on energy savings in the process of collecting data using cloud technologies, which I wanted to look at from a different angle.  In addition to the visible and "direct" arguments about the dangers of technology, there are cases that prove the opposite.  So, for example, there are stories of using cloud services for the benefit of ecology, described in another of my articles for <a href="https://rb.ru/opinion/cloud-ecology/">RB</a> .  For example, one of the cases that the growing popularity of healthy eating leads to an increase in the threat to the integrity of the ecosystem around the world, due to the increase in the amount of cultivated land.  In order for farmers to more effectively use existing fields and sell the maximum amount of harvest, a cloud platform was developed to optimize the process and share experiences among farmers around the world. <br><br><h2>  About the idea </h2><br>  Concurrently, I am the administrator of the official Microsoft Developer communities on social networks (if you haven‚Äôt met: <a href="https://vk.com/msdnru">VK</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/msdnru/">Fb</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/msdevru">Twitter</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tHbdHKPVm2F49Zz4GiZbg">YouTube</a> , <a href="https://t.me/msdnru">Telegram</a> + <a href="https://t.me/microsoftschool">Telegram Chat</a> ).  As I wrote at the beginning, many interesting ideas and projects remain unaddressed, therefore I propose to conduct an experiment.  You can share in the social.  networks (VK, Twitter) with ideas of your projects using any MS technologies with the #msdevproject tag, or write about them in the comments to this post.  Depending on the number of participants, once a period (for example, a week) we will talk in our communities about the most interesting project.  And according to the results of the quarter, we will hold a vote and write about the winning project on the Habr blog. <br><br>  I would be glad to hear your opinion on this idea and answer any questions.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331930/</a></p>
