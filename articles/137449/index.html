So, in addition to cellular communication, there are such Internet services with which you can make a call from the network to any device that can accept a call. This opportunity is also available to users of the remote work exchange PROhq, which as a result of integration with Tipmeet offers an online phone Online.  This service greatly expands the capabilities of each registered freelancer, turning your personal account on the site into a modern, tech-friendly office. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How does the PROhq online phone differ, for example, from Skype?</b> <br><ul><li>  <b>One click call</b> .  The freelancer and the customer can call each other without having to install a special application.  Just press the "call" button. </li></ul><ul><li>  <b>Talk for money.</b>  The PROhq online phone allows you to set the price for 1 minute of consultation.  Freelancers can give paid advice, and customers can receive voice advice in real time. </li></ul><ul><li>  <b>Always online.</b>  The phone allows the freelancer to always be in touch, regardless of whether he is online or not.  To do this, simply set up call forwarding to a mobile or landline phone. </li></ul><br>  <b>Installing an online phone with one click</b> <br>  The online phone on the exchange is easy to use and does not require installation of additional software. <br>  With this service, you can make calls both in normal mode and with video broadcasting.  The user can set up call forwarding to such devices as a computer, smartphone, mobile or landline phone number, so other users can call even when you are not on the PROhq website.  In addition, you can set the time during which you will be available to other users.  Thanks to this service, there are more opportunities to improve the quality of remote collaboration.  For example, it becomes possible to discuss issues arising in the process of implementing a project in the on-line mode, without waiting for an answer in personal messages or emails, as a result of which the workflow is greatly accelerated.  In addition, it becomes easier for the customer and the contractor to agree on cooperation. <br><br>  <b>Additional income and communication tool</b> <br>  A freelancer with the help of this service can receive additional income, since calls can be made, including on a paid basis.  Paid calls provide a remote worker the opportunity to conduct online consultations, training seminars and master classes.  Payment for services in this case occurs in real time.  Accordingly, the range of services that can be represented on the PROhq freelance market is expanding: the online phone allows you to conduct training for those professionals who need a personal audience presence (for example, these can be video-conferencing workshops from girls involved in needlework).  A freelancer who has an online telephone in his personal account is more accessible to the customer, which greatly increases the level of trust.

      <b>Micronime and online project work</b> <br>  The customer also benefits from using the online telephone.  Employers who are connected to this service can contact the contractor at any time, should any question arise.  Thus, having received the answer immediately, the freelancer continues to work without spending time waiting.  Convenience lies in the search for a performer: you can call the candidate you like right away, directly from his profile, and discuss the details of cooperation.  It is much more convenient and faster than the correspondence through personal messages or emails.  In addition, the customer can get advice on-line without spending time on a personal meeting with a specialist.  Consultations are possible both on a paid and free basis, depending on the specifics and the price list of the freelancer. <br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/26227787/online-call.jpg" alt="image"><br>  You can select a suitable specialist through a search on the PROhq exchange and talk on the phone to find a performer or get advice.  Profiles of specialists with an online phone contain an active ‚ÄúCall‚Äù button and visually display the current status: Online or Offline.  If the freelancer is online, he is currently available to communicate, you do not need to waste time on scheduling a call. <br><br>  Thus, the ‚ÄúOnline Phone‚Äù service is not only convenient and modern, but also very useful, both for freelancers and for customers.  To connect an online phone in your personal account, a registered user must follow the instructions described in the Online Phone tab.  After connecting to the service you get the opportunity to set the cost of calls, availability schedule and redirection to other devices. <br><br>  Use all types of communication from <a href="http://www.prohq.ru/">PROhq</a> 100%! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137449/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137449/</a></p>
