  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blogs about self-development</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Self-development blogs are much more rare today than news or diary resources.  This is understandable: the basis of posts in such blogs is the author‚Äôs experience in transforming one‚Äôs life or just a critical look at the imperfections of human nature, which requires much more effort than writing news articles or an essay like ‚ÄúI tested the Nokia N73‚Äù.  Below are some of the most interesting and popular blogs, united by the theme of self-development. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/">www.stevepavlina.com</a> - perhaps the most popular blog, whose author, Steve Pavlina, was one of the first to write about experiments to improve his life.  Steve conducts interesting sociopsychological experiments on himself, in particular, the transition to polyphasic sleep and the experiment on the organization of the ‚Äúfund of millionaires‚Äù - and now there are more than two million dollars in it.  Blog in English. <br><br>  <a href="http://lifehack.org/">lifehack.org</a> is undoubtedly the second most important resource of ‚Äúself-development‚Äù information among blogs.  Its name answers the question - ‚Äúbut what do we actually write about?‚Äù Life hack, ‚Äúhacking life‚Äù, bypassing obstacles - this is the main thrust of the texts that can be found here.  Moreover, the topics of the posts are different - there are both extracts and practical recommendations on the application of well-known theories, for example, conflict management, and exotic texts, for example, yoga exercises for a qualitative change in mental activity.  There is a sorting by tags.  Blog in English.

      <a href="http://lifeidea.org/">lifeidea.org</a> is one of the most popular Russian-language blogs about self-development: it contains about a hundred articles, notes, translations, book reviews - all on the topic of improving yourself and your life.  The author of the blog, Mikhail Suboch, personally conducted an experiment on turning from an owl into a lark, now rises every day at five and has time to do one and a half times more cases than before.  I will note: useful affairs.  And Mikhail knows well how useful things differ from useless ones. <br><br>  <a href="http://experimentator.ru/">experimentator.ru</a> is a resource that is in many respects similar to the previous one ‚Äî for people who are looking for a better life not through metaphysical fabrications, but experimentally.  As the author of the blog says: ‚ÄúThe‚Äú Experimenter ‚Äùblog was conceived as a powerful support for oneself in the business of my life - to make this world a better place.  All the experiments of this blog are not indulgence for fun, but real attempts to change this world, starting with itself. ‚Äù  There are quite curious, described in detail many days of experiments that you immediately want to try yourself, for example, mastering the method of self-programming using the Jos√© Silva method. <br><br>  <a href="http://sergeybiryukov.ru/">Sergeybiryukov.ru</a> - blog, obviously, Sergey Biryukov.  Its main content - thought forms and translated materials on the development of their strengths and ‚Äúpulling up‚Äù of weaknesses - improving health, rethinking your character, getting rid of bad habits, and so on.  The blog is recommended for periodic reading to all people engaged in the field of creativity. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.lief.ru/">www.lief.ru</a> is the blog of Anatoly Tikhomirov, a man, not without success striving for an ideal life.  Most of the material is a repetition, a retelling of posts from the above sources, but there are also texts based on the author‚Äôs own experience. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.i-did-it.ru/">www.i-did-it.ru</a> - ‚ÄúI did it!‚Äù - no, this community is not about first sex, but about real success in life, first steps in business, first salary ... This community can be called ‚Äústories of big and small success ", however, the value of some stories is questionable.  But I do not argue, reading such stories raises the motivation to do something yourself: you see that others went through many failures before they came to success. <br><br>  There are several Russian-speaking communities dedicated to self-improvement in lj, in particular, <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_time_mngmnt/profile">time management in Russian</a> , <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/homo_informa/profile">homo information</a> , and my community is <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/mnema/profile">mnemy</a> (I confess it is almost dead) to improve memory. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the majority of blogs on self-development greatly lose in the quality of the submitted information because the authors do not have enough scientific and practical information on the subject.  The bands of failures that people go through in an attempt to achieve a new improvement, a new useful habit, could, if not be removed at all, then be greatly curtailed if reading these remarkable people were not limited to the special, and therefore rather shallow, literature on self-improvement.  Many techniques could be mastered more easily through the use of advances in <a href="http://www.orlov-yoga.com/">yoga</a> and scientific psychology.  But this is a completely different topic for conversation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4692/</a></p>
