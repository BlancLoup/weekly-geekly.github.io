And then we got into the backstage of the Toshiba booth, where we saw a thin, pretense AT200.  And yet it turned out PocketBook released the coolest budget reader tablet called A10 ". <br><br><h4>  Samsung Galaxy Note </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/u2T38hNgl5E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjNhsFFV5kQc0EzJudeQh5wgALA6g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On the night of the third to the fourth of September, the Berlin police watched Samsung employees carry out their assignments and remove all references to the Galaxy Tab 7.7 from the stands.  Perhaps the German court and one of the most fair courts in the world (we did not check, thank God), but the Koreans with its decision on the claim of Apple against Samsung do not agree and will fight.  In the meantime, a counterclaim is being filed, they should remove all information about the tablet.  Consultants, poorly hiding a lie, are forced to say that the G-7 was not even mentioned.  In the meantime, the court case, all attention is riveted to the Galaxy "neither fish nor meat"  And we decided to take another approach to this gadget and talk about it in more detail.

      A few years ago, no one would have thought that ‚Äúshovels‚Äù like SGS-II or HTC Sensation with a 4-inch diagonal display would settle in the pockets of hundreds of thousands of people.  And now it seems to me that the 5.29-inch tablet, or the Galaxy Note phone, is somehow too much.  But I admit that in a year or two I will walk with such a thing and think: how did I work with the four-inch screen before ?! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de4/7bd/2f3/de47bd2f30d251e3d40b2b4cb3f81d97.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, formally, Note is still a smartphone running Android 2.3.  You can call from it, and all elements, starting from the speaker, ending with the volume control, are in the same places as the Galaxy S II.  The only difference is the pencil case on the bottom, where the stylus is inserted, because of which this model is called so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab2/961/280/ab2961280d120de5fe4ecef7920664b0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I can‚Äôt say what to write with this pen is as convenient as on paper or at least a classic tablet (there‚Äôs still a slight delay between movement and the appearance of a stroke on the screen), but nevertheless, this feature does not burden, because Silus does not interfere at all.  Let it be, maybe someone will come in handy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f1/1c4/44f/9f11c444f7ac3f8d4e8752fd9f467ea1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In all other respects, the Galaxy Note looks more like a tablet than a phone.  The screen, no matter how you say it, is so big that it is impossible to hold the device with one hand and operate it.  The screen resolution is also outstanding - 1280 x 800 pixels.  The eye hardly distinguishes individual pixels.  Samsung's dual-core processor is overclocked to 1.4 GHz, which gives it some performance gains relative to SGS-II, for which the same processor runs at 1.2 GHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a3/3c7/9dc/4a33c79dcab0a672823906be9929ee56.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most important thing is the battery.  There is enough space in the Note to accommodate a high-capacity battery - 2500 mAh.  This should be enough hours for 20 active use, and maybe a day.  For the sake of a combination of such battery life and performance, many, I think, will close their eyes to too large dimensions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6f/021/862/d6f02186212cf5e71d54f1b5a6d2efe0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, to find out what price Samsung will assign to this gadget, you will have to wait a bit.  While the company‚Äôs representatives are silent, as partisans, they say nothing about the release date, or how much the device can cost at least about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/908/7da/444/9087da4441cb286d895977d91ed54c5d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Toshiba AT200 </h4><br>  I have to admit the technological superiority of the iPad over the other tablets, but I still want to have some kind of alternative.  Therefore, when it is possible to find something interesting without a bitten apple on the back cover, we immediately want to tell about it! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFcUhc2v2fU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiGnV0rjXOrRl_yDeurWyCqkLzFyQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The Toshiba AT200 tablet is very thin - only 7.7 mm.  Therefore, almost all the connectors with which it is equipped have a micro prefix.  There is a micro-USB, microSD and micro-HDMI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/233/107/f10/233107f10f596c8d7290c67c6c5f4400.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to micro connectors, there is, of course, a 3.5 mm audio output and a wide proprietary charging connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a0/8f4/aa0/7a08f4aa0e7f6b2317a0bc1d663d16ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The entire front panel of the AT200 is glossy.  The diagonal of the screen is 10.1 inches, the resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels, and inside it has a TI OMAP 4430 processor with a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz, a gigabyte of RAM and up to 64 GB of main memory.  The weight of the device is 558 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/849/5f6/277/8495f62773933d5b65bfcd8e38e14704.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back of the metal cover there was a place for a 5 megapixel camera with a small LED flash. <br><br><h4>  PocketBook A10 " </h4><br>  We went to the PocketBook stand with a great deal of skepticism: they say, another slow-moving tablet reader will show, not interesting.  But what we saw pleased us.  As soon as PocketBook moved production to the Foxconn plant, its hardworking workers rubbed their hands with corn, collecting ipads, and it immediately turned out well. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEfowMVwOF0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg2kXi_OaoORamOZ1FG7iTn0pjcYw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The gadget runs on a gigahertz TI OMAP 3621 processor and Android 2.3.4 operating system.  Inside 4 GB of internal memory and 512 MB of RAM.  Resolution 10-inch capacitive display is 1024x768 pixels.  He responds to touch, he is pretty good, no complaints with the screen did not cause. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df1/ae2/c2f/df1ae2c2f54b0c2cf969c1e1df0160ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The case is made of white glossy plastic, the back cover is black and matte, the tablet will not slip out of hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be6/b0e/b87/be6b0eb871e03f7c92840b7455020d82.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Particularly pleased with the presence of mechanical buttons on the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d1/00e/ac2/1d100eac20beac0069e4a8642f180246.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you put the tablet horizontally, then on the right panel there will be a power button, a slot for microSD cards and a microUSB connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4a/3ca/867/a4a3ca8675a8ddfa8ff33ddedba48a28.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the left - audio input and volume buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/309/c95/c51/309c95c511ced56af740fb05a3838d70.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is no need to arrange a ritual to call the Android Market - the PocketBook A 10 "branded store of" android "applications is there. And with it is the proprietary software for reading e-books. There is also a Wi-Fi module and a 2 megapixel front camera. The gadget weighs about that the same as the first iPad - 670 grams. One full battery charge (6,600 mAh, by the way!), according to the developers, is enough for some reason for only 6.5 hours of battery life. Strange, considering the fact that there is even a processor not dual-core. But, nevertheless, the gadget is very and  and interesting to find a buyer for sure. In Russia, PocketBook A 10 "will cost in the region of 12 000 rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127945/</a></p>
