Actually, I myself still watch with my wife the new ‚ÄúInterns‚Äù series on the budget Aiptek PocketCinema V60.  However, the brand has another important activity - the production of video equipment, in particular, video cameras and car recorders.  Recently, I had the opportunity to get acquainted with the device, which has absorbed both the leading Aiptek product vectors.  In general, Aiptek ProjectorCam C25 - that's what happens if you cross a video camera and pico projector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/872/284/402/872284402ede28b50b8a11c0b47b8b77.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  When viewing the ‚Äúassortment‚Äù, I immediately remembered the iON action cameras ‚Äî they also included a complete list of interchangeable plugs so that the device could be charged anywhere in the world.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebd/aaf/844/ebdaaf84428b3e7ab181efd067e0bfc1.jpg"><br><br>  Not that I expected to see such a variety, but on the other hand - after all, cameras (to put it mildly) are often used mainly in traveling.  And if there has been a vacation with a stop in different countries, the "reserve" does not interfere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfe/1b6/bc1/dfe1b6bc1eceb68e26523f8aaf9dc73d.jpg"><br><br>  The list of cables does not shine variety - miniUSB and AV.  The latter looks somewhat archaic, for example, in my home for at least the last couple of years there has not been a single ‚Äúscreen‚Äù with an analog input.  The HDMI cable would look more appropriate, especially since the corresponding connector is present in the video camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c48/d32/b86/c48d32b86088880021e7e2a30563a5ea.jpg"><br><br>  Paper set is limited to a sheet of compatibility with batteries and network chargers;  brief manual without a version in Russian;  and warranty book. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac8/a8a/5d9/ac8a8a5d9d7680b9bc1246a441ae9cc5.jpg"><br><br>  The CD contains the full version of the manual, including in Russian.  It is necessary to pay tribute, the instruction is made correctly, to understand the management and settings is easy.  The installer of the program ArcSoft TotalMedia Extreme, which includes means of viewing and editing both photo and video, is also stored here.  As far as I can see from the developer‚Äôs website, the full version of the product costs $ 129.99.  Interestingly, the ‚ÄúArcsoft Total Media Extreme‚Äù for the Aiptek ProjectorCam C25 is listed in the ‚ÄúSystem Requirements‚Äù column. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11f/dad/bd4/11fdadbd400f6a6ed63d35be89cb13a7.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Design and management </h4><br>  Externally, the Aiptek ProjectorCam C25 is practically no different from the usual ‚Äúgeneral purpose‚Äù video camera.  Unless the swiveling display draws attention to itself, in part with which the projector is attached.  Official dimensions are as follows: 124 x 63.7 x 58.6 mm, weight without battery - 308 grams.  I will give a visual comparison with my personal camera Canon LEGRIA HFM307. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fa/be0/926/7fabe09261592d39a2b882c821bf796b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36a/10e/c59/36a10ec599992d86719ee93076898bb2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f38/548/fe0/f38548fe02c0be596b02cb3bb6dfc6bc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f9/a97/6eb/1f9a976eb6e9a90ea8e0252aadd5d9ef.jpg"><br><br>  Ergonomics Aiptek ProjectorCam C25 deserves a strong four, I did not notice overt flaws.  On the other hand, I would like to see the places of contact with the palm less ‚Äúthin‚Äù - look at how the right tank is sealed in my Canon, and almost the full length is under the fingertips at the top left.  In the Aiptek ProjectorCam C25, the upper side on the left ends too ‚Äútoo soon,‚Äù with the result that my fingers rested on a raised, narrow edge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d23/b96/742/d23b9674239b79ae9ff43588bac41f90.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/457/7fe/c1e/4577fec1eabf528fb2e27cf196071f2b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05e/a6f/24d/05ea6f24de24cd6e8aa1720de3caa2ce.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1cf/713/d04/1cf713d04919d85a8412f5a0cf503e27.jpg"><br><br>  A variety of Aiptek ProjectorCam C25 case materials is largely similar to other cameras of similar form factor.  The main part is a glossy surface with microscopic sparkles.  In theory, one would have to say about high brand, but in the aggregate, the fingerprints are not striking, I did not have the desire to systematically wipe the coating. <br><br>  Sideways there is a matte insert, a justified solution for one of the main points of contact with the palm.  A similar non-shiny surface is used from the rear as well as below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b78/a16/6f8/b78a166f85470cc075934ca7bada23e7.jpg"><br><br>  Build quality is good, against the background of my much more prone to scratches Canon.  The only thing that bore the camera was a slight pushing, if you forcefully press on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe part with the screen. <br><br>  Behind it is a stub with talking inscriptions; we open and confirm the veracity of the instructions - the miniHDMI and miniUSB connectors are in place.  The start / stop key for video shooting is set on the left; in the photo mode, the button is responsible for taking a snapshot.  The element has an intermediate position to start the focusing process.  By the way, the button is completely devoid of play and, according to my feelings, over time should not be loose.  Do not lose sight of the work / shooting indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/507/113/372/5071133726eb45a41027ae05051056c7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/559/428/4b5/5594284b55e14cb4952fedd78857aae8.jpg"><br><br>  Below, first of all, attention is paid to the shift to the lens side of the hole for the tripod.  At first, this was surprising, but then it became clear that in the opened state, the best weight is distributed, taking into account the weighting due to the built-in projector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/687/36e/f76/68736ef76674384ca9341add1a920a9d.jpg"><br><br>  Under the hood there are slots for the battery and the SD memory card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ddb/db4/e13/ddbdb4e13e082de276a03d8a3922dfa3.jpg"><br><br>  A strange situation turned out with protruding legs, which seem to be designed for smooth installation of the camera on a flat surface.  The legs on the ‚Äúchrome‚Äù coating were higher, as a result, the Aiptek ProjectorCam C25 ‚Äúcollapses‚Äù a couple of millimeters to the side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29d/07b/5e6/29d07b5e6fdf7d48d28599cb384db7c0.jpg"><br><br>  The lever at the top performs functions depending on the camera's mode of operation: scaling when taking photos / videos, adjusting the volume when watching videos, and scrolling while managing captured photos.  The motion of the lever is moderately tight, again, there is no backlash.  Just above the speaker is at a decent volume, I heard the sound well, watching the video received on the street. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e64/360/9a7/e643609a7860cffa4f5849f2a83ac64f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a56/22c/5ce/a5622c5cea533725c5ff90c1151e4daf.jpg"><br><br>  And here is the protruding part of the projector, on the top - the focus adjustment.  The swivel display is touch-sensitive, the symbols on the screen frame are designed to control the projector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e90/2aa/d1e/e902aad1e6f4995486b11a5ffd922ee3.jpg"><br><br>  Opposite the screen (in the folded state) there is a power button that risks to remain unclaimed.  The fact is that the camera automatically turns on / off when the part with the screen is tilted.  At first it annoyed me a little, but then I thought that ‚Äújust like that,‚Äù I never once threw away the element with the display ‚Äî viewing the content, shooting, working on the projector ‚Äî I would still need to turn on the camera.  However, the irritation did not completely pass, because the start of work is always accompanied by a rather loud two-second melody.  I could not turn it off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1e/a12/9ca/e1ea129ca24832e526f98c05630d071b.jpg"><br><br>  The lens is closed with a cover that can be easily removed without even squeezing the ‚Äúgrip‚Äù on the springs.  Self-timer indicator, the lens itself, LED-backlight - nothing superfluous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ee/cb7/0bd/2eecb70bdd1c9ea66271b1a0cd0b6625.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Settings </h4><br>  Access to camera options is carried out in two main ways.  The first is to tap individual interactive elements on the display.  That is, one-touch setting is given for resolution, focus options, LED-lights and the choice of scene mode.  Immediately revealed a minor flaw - the lists on the screen do not scroll with a sliding gesture, you have to press the movement buttons.  But it is convenient that the number of screens in the current tab is always displayed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42f/533/88d/42f53388d3cfc03b7901fc646995b240.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/683/daa/403/683daa40317c085d652b7c1df7b9e4d4.jpg"><br><br>  To call a more or less centralized "meeting" of settings, click the list icon in the lower left corner.  Then, to switch between packages of options, touch the icon in the upper left corner: ‚Äúvideo‚Äù, ‚Äúphoto‚Äù and ‚Äúother‚Äù camera settings. <br><br>  Video: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff2/a4c/126/ff2a4c1266b2b7cb7ff08499e508cfcb.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  "Quality" is very good, good, ordinary; </li><li>  ‚ÄúPrerecord‚Äù - the implementation of this item remained unclear to me, the instruction explains that the option ‚Äúrecords images before you press the‚Äú Record ‚Äùbutton‚Äù; </li><li>  "Cycle" - shooting timelapse, getting a frame every 1, 5 or 30 minutes; </li><li>  ‚ÄúMotion detection‚Äù is probably a useful point when using a camera for security surveillance; </li><li>  "White balance"; </li><li>  "Exposure" - by average, center or point; </li><li>  ‚ÄúDigital effect‚Äù - sepia, negative, black and white, saturated and the picture (in oil). </li></ul><br>  A photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e8/698/346/0e869834641b2575c446132d6cd658a0.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  "Shooting mode" - normal, continuous shooting; </li><li>  "View" - on / off.  Responsible for displaying a snapshot immediately after it is taken; </li><li>  ‚ÄúSelf-timer‚Äù - delay for 2 or 10 seconds; </li><li>  "White balance"; </li><li>  ‚ÄúExposure‚Äù - similar to ‚Äúvideo‚Äù; </li><li>  "AE ISO" - auto (in the range of 100-400, 100-800 or 100-1600), 100, 200, 400, 800, 1 600; </li><li>  ‚ÄúDigital effect‚Äù is similar to ‚Äúvideo‚Äù. </li></ul><br>  The menu of viewing photos and videos I remember the options to protect one or all files from being deleted. <br><br><h4>  In work </h4><br>  Aiptek ProjectorCam C25 is equipped with a 5 megapixel 1 / 3.2 "matrix and is capable of taking pictures in the following resolutions: <br><br><ul><li>  16M (4608x3456), 4: 3, interpolation; </li><li>  12M (4000x3000), 4: 3, interpolation; </li><li>  8M (3200x2400), 4: 3, interpolation; </li><li>  5M (2592x1944), 4: 3; </li><li>  3M (2048x1536), 4: 3. </li></ul><br>  I got the following test shots: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f7/07a/669/4f707a669c03bcd0b3ab55f9417d6767.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b20/805/39b/b2080539bb788a9d8b5a6db681d8838a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac6/e22/1f2/ac6e221f2a30f3259f2275e46304bf34.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/871/e6a/f33/871e6af33e4313e3e9efd5f18ad33dda.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57b/761/fc9/57b761fc99cd394984d327f15fb50260.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/537/154/1a8/5371541a8b57de7875fefa1b108fc4ff.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c9/fc3/b4e/6c9fc3b4e9fc545f4064c784e4e55529.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7d/d45/128/a7dd451289f7d1f01f6e3d98e34363f7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6e/3fc/f44/c6e3fcf443509c8388e2a219bdf8cd35.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb7/14e/28a/bb714e28a372fe4abffced63890ed02d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07e/5f0/f9c/07e5f0f9c04e739e3d806550c53388c9.jpg"><br><br>  In the room when I was away from the window, and also in the elevator, practically no photos of me had escaped the ‚Äújerkiness‚Äù.  It was noticeable that the camera refuses to take snapshots and "wise" with a shutter speed.  On the street, this was not observed. <br><br>  Moving on to shooting video, Full HD resolution options are available at 30 fps and HD at 60 or 30 fps.  As it turned out, it is impossible to manually specify the point of focus on the screen, because with the object on the side it was not always possible to get the desired construction of the picture.  The camera does not provide any measures of image stabilization.  Unfortunately, during the test survey there was an impenetrable fog in the yard, which had a corresponding effect on the testing capabilities - it didn‚Äôt work out to test the Aiptek ProjectorCam C25 on a clear sunny day. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eh_bO5UEI0Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhnutiUjP7GLwEfpCyuXVKabS6zWw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Shooting with a tripod with a ball head</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Y34dAxRey0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhe-c9gAk2Dunt313jFS5TgfZeVdQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Strolling, shooting from the hands</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uEXN9xEEfm0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh02qihccZaiY60qQkPi9yyU2weeg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Here would be more numbers to make out ...</i> <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  A 3-inch display is enough for messing around with settings and viewing content.  The specific technology of the sensory layer is not specified, but I least thought about the presence of a resistive option.  The sensitivity is high, I did not have to indicate something several times - unlike the Canon‚Äôs own camera.  The viewing angles are wide, the inversion is manifested only when the screen is rotated with its upper part towards itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94a/3ef/d2e/94a3efd2e6a7748ab4b1a47f7409d073.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Projector </h4><br>  In order to activate the projector, go to the content viewing menu, open a specific photo / video and then press the ‚ÄúPROJECTOR‚Äù key on the left side of the screen frame.  After that, the display is completely turned off and control is performed only by the ‚Äúframe‚Äù buttons.  ‚ÄúOK‚Äù - start / stop playback, for some reason, the return button duplicates the ‚Äúshut up‚Äù function on the key above.  The top pair of elements is responsible for switching between files. <br><br>  The characteristics of the projector are as follows: DLP technology, up to 10,000 hours of operation, 1000: 1 contrast, resolution of 640 x 360, brightness up to 25 lumens, focusing distance 20-160 cm. Finally, the diagonal of the image is 5-50 inches.  I have no complaints about the quality of the image, but there are obvious limitations with brightness.  During the day, I was able to more or less normally view the video from a maximum of 1-1.5 meters.  In the dark it is better; the distance increases ‚Äúfrom wall to wall‚Äù.  I liked the focus control using the slider - it's much more convenient and more accurate than turning the wheel in my Aiptek PocketCinema V60. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7f/f9f/b11/e7ff9fb11ac9cbfd406463e7c1a6678b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  After working with Aiptek ProjectorCam C25, I had associations with various hybrid recorders.  When two devices are combined into one, it seems to be a more versatile and functional product.  But upon closer examination, it turns out that in each category within the device, there are invariably compromises of different sizes.  So with the Aiptek ProjectorCam C25 - I have a separate video camera, which is superior to this model in terms of ease of operation, different "chips".  And there is an extremely low-cost projector from Aiptek, which still almost bypasses the Aiptek ProjectorCam C25. <br><br>  However, as it should be, the hybrid, the model "takes" its price - 299 euros.  In any case, such a price tag was indicated in the news.  Alas, there are serious problems with the discovery of the Aiptek ProjectorCam C25 in retail in the CIS (and not only).  But <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1010737-REG/aiptek_c25_projector_camcorder.html">here</a> , for example, the camera costs $ 329.99.  Therefore, if we consider the device in terms of the ratio of price and characteristics, it turns out quite attractive and positively extraordinary device.  Such even as an expensive and unusual gift will do. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212251/</a></p>
