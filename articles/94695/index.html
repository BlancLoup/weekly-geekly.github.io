I propose to familiarize the habrasoobshchestvo with this point of view, and since I do not know whether the site will work tomorrow / today, I quote the text in full: <br><br><blockquote><h4>  The story of how to display spalled bugs to clean water, and not only about this </h4><br><br><h4>  Foreword </h4><br>  It all started right here with this article: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/93532/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/93532</a> , this one continued: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/94370/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/94370</a> , and it will most likely end with a real one.

      To the commentators of the second article I can immediately recommend not to read this: for themselves they have already drawn conclusions and voiced, based on the opinion of the author.  This article is intended primarily for those who have a level of judgment that does not allow one-sided look at the situation, based only on the hysterical moans of one of the members of society. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Plot </h4><br>  Nowadays, excessive bragging and a sense of impunity in the Internet community can bring the boaster to clear water very quickly.  What is one of the comments of the author of these articles on the question of opening a store on ebay / Amazon (http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/93532/#comment_2840771).  Does he hemorrhoids stoop and raise easy money?  Thousands of people only do mass retail sales on those sites - the creation of your store is excellent there, you don‚Äôt even need to create your own website, advertise, etc.  And for ‚ÄúMeber with a very good rating,‚Äù and even with a streamlined supply chain of a unique product with an exclusive contract from cairon.com, it‚Äôs just a sin not to use it.  Although, this is all nonsense compared to what I learned from all this experiment.  But first things first. <br><br>  Initially, this experiment was planned to confirm my guess: after all, a piece of plastic for the most fashionable and expensive electronic-mobile toy of our time cannot be so unique and in demand that only the wise Klops could think of such an organization of sales and make this business machine work to myself.  Interestingly, how many of you all asked this same question yourself when you read the first article?  So, with minimal cost, I decided to find out how true it is, what the real market is for this product, and, most importantly, whether the purpose of the first article is really to share the experience of creating a successful business model. <br><br>  In one day of uncomplicated work, you can make a copy of the site and start promoting it.  In a day there will be the first visitors.  The most costly in this business was advertising, because  the result was needed quickly in order to get the most reliable information, a ‚Äúslice‚Äù of the market for this product (and as it turned out later, the strategy was correct). <br><br>  What we had a week later: a well-promoted website for keywords, a lot of advertising on various sites and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãvisitors.  No, only two of these points are true.  Well, this could have closed the experiment, perhaps by commenting on that very first article.  But here Klops himself intervened in the course of events, writing a second article, thereby unexpectedly continuing the experiment and revealing much more interesting features.  Features of whom, you ask?  You, dear commentators articles Klops.  Firstly, thanks to you, visiting the double site has increased to several thousand people a day.  Those.  these are all those who read the first article, thereby creating traffic for the original site, increasing its ranking.  But the most interesting thing is the reaction of the readers: almost everyone unanimously condemned ‚Äúthat bad guy,‚Äù without even trying to move his brains from the beginning (is it really Klops' innovative idea? Or maybe it‚Äôs not the idea at all, but the article is written for something else? ), not now (why this twin site was created? But was Klops really so good, who now laments the loss of ‚ÄúThree tape recorders, three movie cameras from abroad, three cigarette cases domestic, a suede jacket ... three jackets!‚Äù).  Sorry, comrades commentators klopsovyh articles, but you really are very short-sighted.  I wonder how easily you can manage and use you for your own purposes.  Your laziness to think about why a piece of plastic has become so unique and in high demand is still understandable, but your convictions are like the groans of old men who scold the current government and remember the Union with cheap sausage.  You haven‚Äôt even done anything to check something, to dig into this topic on the Internet, to get to the facts, to understand what it is about and so real is what you are told about.  In order to find out that with certain countries on the paper you can choose any name, you need no more than a minute of your time ... although it is easier to scold and be with the majority.  You are like a flock of sheep flying to another victim just because you showed it.  ‚ÄúLet's arrange Habraeffect for him, let's fill up with complaints, let's spam him ...‚Äù It seems to me that in the 17th year it was about the same.  Someone then said that it was necessary to make a revolution, and everyone went to do it, without even thinking about what it would lead to, and whether it is needed at all.  Sadly somehow becomes after this.  It becomes even sadder after realizing that Klops‚Äôs article is popular in this community.  Although there is nothing surprising: people who are successful and educated are unlikely to come to read an article about fraud.  It is unlikely that they will even comment on another article with a good idea: is the opinion of society, but alien, so important compared to the time spent on comments, but its own?  As for the series itself of two articles, it becomes more clear to me which of the two told about fraud, and which about cheating. <br><br>  Dear Klops, I will soon send you the contacts of all (!) Customers who have responded to your advertisement.  All the ten who have moved from your website to the twin site for the entire time of its existence ... despite the not weak promotion (as already noted in the comments to the second article).  The domain itself, by the way, after the experiment, I will gladly give you the same, taking into account the cost of advertising - for 150 euros.  If this site hurt you so badly (hurt judging by your words about 7,000 from the monthly turnover), and it also has its weight in search engines, it turns out that my proposal is just perfect for you.  I see some benefits in this: cheaply you take a promoted website, redirect to yours and no one bothers you anymore, but rather helps to recruit customers.  Or do you realize your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating competition for yourself (http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/93532/#comment_2840124). <br><br>  Dear friends, here is the simplest solution to the problem, which the author of the article greatly exaggerated, which made it difficult for me to know where all his and my clients shared, which should be a few thousand, according to conservative estimates.  After all, nothing in the 5 days of operation of the double site could not scare them away.  On the contrary, the market for this product has expanded: advertising was distributed through channels other than the original site. <br>  As they say, lie, do not be fooled: the Internet does not forgive this. <br><br><h4>  Epilogue </h4><br>  It‚Äôs impossible to lose what you don‚Äôt have ... <br>  In reality, Klops at least got its profit from advertising its site, using users of Habr, who are distinguished by a pronounced herd effect.  In addition, due to all the same users, he tried to overcome (or mitigate the consequences) of one of his complexes - there was really plenty of praise.  For his boasting and irresponsible chatter, he can be punished.  Nevertheless, if everything that he wrote is true, it will be a mere nonsense for him to buy a promoted domain for his store and no longer complain to society (read Klops‚Äôs question in the second article carefully). <br><br>  I will not advise you to be more critical of what you are being presented to you: people who are present do not need this because they either understand this (few though, for example, asya_minor <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/93532/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/93532/#comment_2844337</a> ), or once again ignored. <br><br>  Thanks to everyone for just being themselves and writing in the comments of the second article everything they thought about - it really helped.  Special thanks to Klops, without whom it would be difficult to understand some of the features of this society, as well as of individual "startups". <br><br>  It remains only to wish you all the best of luck! <br><br>  PS It turns out that this is not all.  This story has a piquant ending.  Very soon, a site may appear on this site, from which it tore off the design (we must pay tribute to it by working on the copy) and it is possible that the most important thing is the idea itself.  The same color scheme, the same content (without wisps, in contrast to the so-called "original site") and all this in 6 languages.  Well, it seems, the time of cheap ponto ends.  Thanks again to all participants in the experiment!  See you soon :-) <br></blockquote><br><br>  PS From myself I will add: as they say, that in every joke there is some truth ... <br><br>  <strong>UPD:</strong> Well, to keep the balance in the universe, the answer is <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/clops/" class="user_link">clops</a> : <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/94695/">I suppose it‚Äôs time for me to finish this discussion by inserting my five kopecks ...</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94695/</a></p>
