  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GOST R 57100-2016. What was it?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In September 2017, the National Standard of the Russian Federation was introduced, which received the designation GOST R 57100-2016 (the status <a href="http://www.gostinfo.ru/catalog/Details/%3Fid%3D6257845">is indicated here</a> , the text can be <a href="https://standartgost.ru/g/%25D0%2593%25D0%259E%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A2_%25D0%25A0_57100-2016">viewed here</a> ) (by simplicity I will call it ‚Äúweaving‚Äù, realizing the risk of being covered with tomatoes for such ad-libbing).  Since we now have to deal with the real requirements of customers regarding the adherence to this standard, even when describing the concept of an information system, it is probably time to look at this standard more closely. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  No one is even going to hide the fact that GOST R is not at all a Gostov approach, as outlined in the ISO / IEC / IEEE 42010: 2011 Systems and software engineering - Architecture description.  Moreover, this approach is not at all from the word, for GOST R 57100-2016 is not only in no way associated with any GOST, but also makes its own, alien to the traditional GOST philosophy (I will not speak about the quality of the text of the standard) other standards are given either in Russian ‚ÄúISO / IEC 10746‚Äù or in English ‚ÄúISO 15704‚Äù in language - apparently, it was difficult for the authors of the ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù to agree on this among themselves). <br><br>  Admittedly, it is somewhat discouraging that the National Standard was introduced not in conjunction with other national standards associated with it, but directly refers to foreign standards, even if they are accepted by authoritative international organizations.

      I recall that, according to paragraph 3 of Article 26 of the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Standardization in the Russian Federation‚Äù, ‚Äúthe use of a national standard is mandatory for the manufacturer and (or) performer in the case of a public statement on the conformity of products to the national standard, including standard in the labeling, in the operational or other documentation, and (or) product labeling with the mark of the national standardization system ‚Äù. <br><br>  In other words, the customer, who prescribes the requirement to follow this standard in his Terms of Reference, obliges the contractor and himself to follow not only the national GOSTs, but also a whole bunch of international standards, in package with which the ISO / IEC / IEEE 42010 standard was adopted. : 2011.  And if the requirements of GOSTs conflict with international standards, it is necessary to follow the requirements of international standards.  What will happen if their text is changed, the authors of the "weave" are silent. <br><br>  Terrible translation of terms.  For example, the framework turned into a ‚Äústructure‚Äù in translation, having lost its original meaning: the term ‚Äústructure‚Äù more refers to the template of a certain document, and the term ‚Äúframework‚Äù is more often understood as the basis, the framework.  What he, in fact, is according to ISO / IEC / IEEE 42010: 2011.  Indeed, this standard does not describe the structure of the architecture, but approaches, principles and practices that can be used as the basis for describing the architecture. <br><br>  The term ‚Äúconcern‚Äù has turned into ‚Äúinterest‚Äù, and everything would be fine if it were not for decoding in ‚Äúweave‚Äù: it turns out, interest is ‚Äúthe benefits or problems in the system that relate to one or several interested parties‚Äù.  In the original, it looked like this: ‚Äúconcern (system) -.  Where did the GOST authors take the problems for their definition? <br><br>  In general, in my opinion, it is impossible to use the text of GOST R 57100-2016 in the form that is submitted to us by its authors.  Use the original text of ISO / IEC / IEEE 42010: 2011. <br><br>  And avoid specifying GOST in your documents, it only imposes additional obligations on you under the law.  In this case, you will not receive any dividends.  It is better to immediately refer to the ISO. <br><br>  <i>PS No, I am not at all against the approaches outlined in the ISO / IEC / IEEE 42010: 2011 standard, do not misunderstand me.</i>  <i>I use these approaches all the time.</i>  <i>But agree that you expect from the National Standard something more than just a non-professional translation of the text of an international standard.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459992/</a></p>
