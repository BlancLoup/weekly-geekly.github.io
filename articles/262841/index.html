You will probably also enjoy the <i>great</i> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/3bv3ze/why_go_and_rust_are_not_competitors/">discussion</a> on Reddit. <br><br>  In fact, Go and Rust solve the same problem: both came to our world to make the life of programmers easier.  Go to ugliness simplified the concept of competitive (aka multi-threaded) programming and it seems to me that it made programming a pleasant experience, because the code on Go is really nice to read.  At the same time, Rust gave us powerful zero-cost abstractions ... for pattern matching.  Sounds justified, doesn't it?  Jokes, jokes, but Rust really made many difficult things easier (a common misconception: he didn't get rid of them).  His diabolical type system allows you to guarantee the safety of memory, and including, get rid of the state of the race, which sounds very tempting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If my memory serves me, Rob Pike (Go language dad) once said that he was very surprised at how everything turned out.  Go thought of as a lifeline for C / C ++ programmers, but in the end, people began to think of it as an alternative or even a replacement for Ruby or Python!  I think it's just awesome, it could not turn out better.

      Well, then what does Go have to do with Rust?  Rust looks like a powerful and safe replacement for C ++, which, as it turned out, has little to do with Go.  Then why do these guys compete at all?  Peace, friendship, cookies!  But nooooo: <br><br><ul><li><h5>  Both languages ‚Äã‚Äãappeared about the same time;  both crap, how ambitious; </h5></li><li><h5>  Both appeared so that we could more easily write reliable software; </h5></li><li><h5>  Applications often overlap (server software, system utilities, etc.). </h5></li></ul><br>  Those who believe that the biggest problem of C ++ is its ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù nature (let's forget for a moment about smart pointers from the latest standards, which by their nature are quite safe) are very much mistaken.  The biggest problem with C ++ is that the code in this language is hard to write, read, debug, profile and maintain.  In fact, there are several known ways to achieve secure memory management.  Ask C programmers for C ++, this is an imaginary problem! <br><br>  Again, C ++ programs are hard to read, write, debug, and maintain.  And this has little to do with memory management!  Rust is no different from C ++.  And you cannot solve this problem by multiplying entities, adding more and more concepts.  Here Go's very cool: ‚Äúless‚Äù exponentially ‚Äúmore‚Äù ( <i>less is exponentially more</i> ). <br><br>  That Go, that Rust - both try to make our lives easier, apart from the fact that Go already really encourages its programmers, helping to write readable and easily supported code with a reasonable number of abstractions, while Rust is hunting for the great and terrible problem of Memory Management .  Go and Rust will always be blood enemies and it is somewhat sad to admit that the latter has already lost this war. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262841/</a></p>
