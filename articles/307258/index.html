Because it is for them to determine how well this store works.  At least a quarter of the population of our country is introvert, and at the same time it comes to stores (that is, it is not clinical hickey). <br><br>  Let's look at a number of rather unobvious things that are especially important for such people.  And, of course, that have an impact on everyone else, too, but to a lesser extent. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      So, the surest way to disrupt a purchase when all is well is to pass behind the back of the person who is considering the regiment.  Everyone who has ever traced flows in stores knows this.  If a person has a second buyer or consultant formed behind his back, he begins to worry, as a developer who has someone standing silently behind his back during debugging.  And most often leaves the store in the next 30 seconds.  And often not aware of why. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Therefore, there is a rule for designing flows - do not make narrow passes, and make at least two paths to each point in the store.  Whoever has ‚ÄúImaginarium‚Äù and ‚ÄúChildren's World‚Äù in the city - you can walk around and compare sensations.  Most of the "peace" in the first will be associated with a wide personal space. <br><br>  Even closer to the peak, for example, the new year or March 8, many people accumulate in the stores.  Therefore, our usual circular layout with one or two islands in the middle is changing.  The islands become smaller, so that people do not jostle. <br><br>  <b>The second important factor is time in the store.</b>  Here, Uncle Paco Underhill at one time proved for one network that if you increase it from three minutes to three and a half minutes, then the sale is done almost twice as often.  The same is on the store's website - if you increase the interest (expressed numerically in the number of pages viewed per session), how your conversion starts to grow.  In real life, it also works with a bang, because people get used to the place and begin to consider it safe and their own (this is an unconfirmed hypothesis). <br><br>  Therefore, if the store can unobtrusively increase your time inside - it will be used to it safely.  Most often we are talking about an interesting assortment that can be touched (see the same Hamleys, especially their trays with clockwork toys and animation), but it is also easier - Ikea, for example, will not let you out until the last, and Auchan and Perekrestok so cleverly arrange key goods That according to the standard list you will bypass the whole store in general. <br><br>  In our case, they decide all sorts of strange little things and the opportunity to play right in the store. <br><br>  The next implicit mechanic is the handing over of the goods to the buyer during the demonstration.  Newbies show goods, holding in their hands.  Experienced sellers put the goods in the hands of the buyer, and show already there.  When you hold a product, you already get used to it.  He is yours.  Take and put it back is not so comfortable.  You know, like in a joke - in order for a person to do well, you need to take something from him, wait, and then return.  So here, just the opposite.  In the end, the toy is taken away. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/546/7f5/f14/5467f5f14d794accb57ee90d0020ca3d.JPG"><br>  <sup>Here in this stand it is very difficult not to take the cube in hand.</sup>  <sup>Have taken?</sup>  <sup>Fine.</sup>  <sup>+12 seconds in the store and 30% to the spontaneous purchase of this product.</sup> <br><br>  And it is important for an introvert to remain one-on-one with the subject of purchase, so that he is not disturbed for some time.  When the seller "feeds him with the hands," it will not work.  There will be a feeling of buying in a hurry.  Well, or no purchase at all.  Plus, there is simply a group of goods that is bought only after feeling, that is, it sells by tactile impressions.  For example, the same <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/hive/">Hive</a> : until you hold heavy chips in your hand, it is not clear why it costs so much.  Well, in general, it is very important to use the maximum channels: in the end, not all people are visuals.  Kinesthetics need a tactile contact, and it is important for an introverted audio digit to read what is written on the box while the seller says something.  Although this is also a personal feeling, naturally, there are no studies. <br><br>  Introverts are the easiest to frighten out of the store with increased attention.  An ordinary person, too, just his shield is more charged.  Therefore, it is also important that the sellers do not stick at once, and the guards were polite and inconspicuous.  From the unobvious, it is extremely unpleasant when the ticket office is at the entrance (this is often done to prevent theft).  I do not know whether it helps with theft or not (but my experience suggests that it is not very strong) - but in terms of comfort, it definitely kills some of the friendliness. <br><br>  From the mood of sellers depends on how they will communicate with people.  A bad product knocks the mood most of all (it‚Äôs necessary to provide the seller with iron confidence in the product and give him the opportunity to remove the product from the sale if he is bad), inadequate visitors (one is aggressive for two hundred, but the seller should have the right not to approach this), and idleness  From the latter saves a list of tasks for certain periods of time.  The optimal time of customer downturns is calculated and works are put on these moments - inventory, re-laying and other things. <br><br>  The seller, by the way, can also be an introvert.  Clearly, it will not be easy for him, but from my practice it is these people who often create the most incredible garbage.  Here (by myself I know) such a thing acts as the ability to easily do anything, and the confidence that it is socially acceptable.  More precisely, you for it will be nothing.  A kind of game turns on - something you wouldn‚Äôt do in serious ways, you can create in the store.  People in response smile and rejoice, and it energizes.  Seriously.  Very unexpected feeling. <br><br>  <b>A person is very limited resource of attention and physical abilities</b> .  Therefore, if he is worried about something in the store, there will be no sale.  Most often - if overloaded with bags.  Therefore, if there is an opportunity - it is worth leaving the bags and bags in a safe place before the sale.  Chain stores have boxes at the entrance or carts where everything can be folded, in the USSR there were special counters with parcels (they still have a lot of places), our sellers sometimes suggest putting bags somewhere in the store and looking after them. <br><br>  More attention is greatly stretched by different color stimuli, optical "garbage" and different mosaics.  Were in the Norwegian and Swedish interiors, where everything is cozy and calm?  Here is the same thing to be in the store.  We have white walls, white (not colored) furniture, the light is directed at the goods. <br><br>  And here is a photograph of a book from Scotland, where such an approach is very clearly visible, only they chose neutral black: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/927/1af/37c/9271af37cbe045cc839ab1d2e0cd5d6a.jpg"><br>  <sup>Notice that the books on the shelves are the cover to the reader.</sup>  <sup>We also have very few games, butt.</sup> <br><br>  On the other hand, a person very quickly and clearly catches the atmosphere of the place on the subliminal channels.  The first impression is made immediately at the end of ‚Äúdecompression‚Äù, that is, a 3‚Äì6 second entry delay when the store is loaded into the brain.  It affects the purity of the store, the brightness of the light (people go to the bright departments - this is especially important in shopping centers), the type of vendors, the combination of general accuracy and some lively negligence in display.  By the way, yes, if the calculation is too neat or dense - people perceive it as an object of art or a clear order and do not dare to touch.  This is especially evident on the pyramids of the goods.  Be sure to lie on top of the crooked two or three pieces, otherwise they will not take. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/778/3ae/916/7783ae916798435f92f45c6ff390a21e.JPG"><br>  <sup>Krasnodar, second-hand shop with a pyramid of books and cats living in the depths.</sup>  <sup>Someone will scare away, but someone immediately a signal of comfort.</sup> <br><br>  And the music solves.  Music is pretty darn important for stores.  Most often, calm, if you need to immerse a person in a sense of security after the city, or, conversely, energetic, if the style is exactly that.  There are heaps of research.  In the meantime, I propose to just walk around the mall and look at how and where the lighting of the product and department is done (you will be surprised how many expensive designs are used for this), listen to the general sound background (you can not always play music in a shopping center, but in single stores Attention). <br><br>  Further, introverts are often committed to the rules.  Ordinary people also love when the store opens at 9:00, as stated, and closes at 22:00, as stated.  If you open later or close earlier, you will immediately begin to dig a wide grave for sales.  The scheme is this: if a person, not even intending to buy, has passed by the store at 21:55, and it is closed (provided that it is open until 22:00), then he will remember that it is necessary to come not without five at the time of purchase, but without fifteen.  Then the following will happen - the last 15 minutes of work will be "dead."  Sellers will close the store themselves before, because what is already there, no one will come anyway.  A month later, the last half hour of the store will be empty.  Therefore, iron punctuality is useful for sales.  And further.  If a person came in at 21:59, and stayed in the store for 15 minutes, then it will close at 22:14.  So it is necessary. <br><br>  For now.  Here is the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/306592/">first</a> post about how the seller should work according to our basic scheme.  If it is interesting - then I will tell you about the layout and its non-obvious features.  In particular, those that help not to screw up with the choice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307258/</a></p>
