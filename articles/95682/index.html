      The idea came from three businessmen at a lunch in a Moscow restaurant, they discussed the inconvenience of orders for food and food directly to the house. <br>  What is the inconvenience? <br>  The Utkonos and the Seventh rule the market for food delivery.  A lot of unpleasant reviews about them can google in minutes.  Yes, and many have already come across them.  When ordering there a lottery. ... Lucky - they brought everything and on time, no luck - and brought in 3 nights and only the floor of the order.  Lucky, however, more often. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/69/e8/69e8f5b527b5501f4d21a1e5983db6a3.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  The food delivery market is ruled by websites with top link budgets and those who slipped spam on your doorstep in time.  Here, in general, an order can be started with ‚ÄúATTENTION!  The cat in the bag!  He always chose either by the appearance of the site, or by the first advertisement that came under his feet.  Many times flew "like plywood over Paris." <br>  These three businessmen decided that they needed to occupy a free niche and bring food and food orders to a new level. <br><br>  <b>Some facts</b> <br><br>  From the emergence of the idea to the implementation of the past 10 months.  The main factors that influence the quality of the order were identified: <br><br><ul><li>  Price </li><li>  Quality </li><li>  Time of delivery </li><li>  range </li></ul><br>  And here for most people in the first place came exactly the delivery time, and only then the quality.  Thus, people agreed to get the product a little lower quality, but faster. <br><br>  The list of offers is not limited to food and food.  In the final version of the site, the range of delivery services was as follows: <br><ul><li>  Ready meal </li><li>  Products </li><li>  Tobacco and Alcohol </li><li>  Flowers and Gifts </li><li>  Medicines </li></ul><br>  Then, at the request of the first customers, a section of the book and CDs was added. <br>  It is worth noting that ready food, food, medicine, flowers, gifts, tobacco / alcohol and books / CDs are used only by regular customers from time to time. <br><br>  The average number of orders per day is 200. <br><br>  Of these, 70% falls on the section ready meals.  20% section products. <br><br>  There are a total of over 5,000 registered on the site. Of these, about 1,000 are dead souls who have not made a single order. <br><br>  <b>Implementation</b> <br><br>  What it looks like for the user who decided to make an order. <br>  Once on the site, you can proceed to the order by entering your address, or just selecting the metro station: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/8b/b5/8bb5622e237d3ed7aa2e26b82582edac.jpg" alt="Enter Address"></div><br><br>  And clicking on the icon corresponding to the desired section: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/72/00/72002942a4a0aeb92d4c06ce17805c8e.jpg" alt="Section Icons"><br><br>  After that, the user will receive a list of the options closest to him.  You can also sort by rating and by name.  As mentioned above, the delivery time is a priority parameter, so sorting by distance is displayed by default. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/19/5f/195f4788410ee98e04115652804d1593.jpg" alt="Result"></div><br><br>  Each restaurant displays its rating (according to users' estimates), the minimum order amount, delivery time (total for the entire delivery area is indicated), opening hours, comments about special promotions and delivery area are indicated in the comments. <br><br>  Since price matters, we added functionality to search by price.  In the screenshot, the first few results for a search for Greek salad. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/61/65/6165c2bc744d4a05296121eb0d08d246.jpg" alt="Selection by price"></div><br><br>  This feature is available for all products presented on the site. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/0a/b4/0ab4bb118e7277b6b7f5cacf60a2aecd.jpg" alt="Find similar options"></div><br><br>  Additional buns: <br><br><ul><li>  Purchase history. </li><li>  Any number of addresses per account. </li><li>  20% of the first order is returned to the phone. </li><li>  Bonus program.  Balls for orders and for friends.  For the first order of 2000 points.  First prize for 2500. </li><li>  Inviting friends about the ref link and sending an invite to the mail. </li><li>  There is a newsletter from which you can unsubscribe ... really you can!  =) </li></ul><br><br>  After placing the order, he gets to our call-center, where our operators lead him from beginning to end.

About this, if it is interesting, then sign for more. <br><br>  Constantly updated list of special offers.  Additional discounts on first orders (plus a return of 20% on a mobile phone), additional gifts.  Everything in this section is exclusive for delivery-club customers. <br><br>  <b>Monetization and investment</b> <br><br>  Warning question about the markup.  There is no extra charge, that is, all prices shown on the site.  equal prices when ordering directly.  Earnings come from affiliate rewards.  On average, this is 10% of the order amount, somewhere more, somewhere less. <br>  Investments in the project amounted to $ 500k.  60% of this figure is the advertising budget. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95682/</a></p>
