Has established itself and we believe. <br>  It would seem, what is simpler: received the money, held it up to fulfillment, transferred the money to the performer (agent). <br>  Now we are not considering the technical implementation, but just now the regulatory authorities of the state will think about it. <br><br>  As soon as the money came to us in an electronic wallet (not even to the current account), under the law on the <abbr title="national payment system">NPC,</abbr> this amount may become part of the taxable base.  Chapter 25 of the Tax Code. <br><br>  If we want this not to happen, then these revenues should satisfy the points <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">1, 2 and / or 9 of Article 251.

The indicated income does not include commission, agency or other similar remuneration; </div></div><br><br>  Thus, I need to build an interaction scheme: Client - I (agent) - traveler (subagent). <br>  Let's call it the scheme <i>‚Äúall through itself‚Äù</i> . <br><br>  If I plan to limit myself to a scheme in which the site is an information platform, where clients and agents meet (let's call its scheme <i>‚Äúinformational activity‚Äù</i> ). <br>  Such payments will be treated as: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Clause 8 of Article 250 of the Tax Code.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Non-operating income.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  8) in the form of gratuitously received property (works, services) or property rights, except for the cases specified in Article 251 of this Code. <br><br>  Upon receipt of property (works, services) gratuitously, income is estimated on the basis of market prices, determined taking into account the provisions of Article 105.3 of this Code, but not lower than the residual value determined in accordance with this chapter - on depreciable property and not less than the cost of production (acquisition) - on other property (work performed, services rendered).  Price information must be confirmed by the taxpayer - the recipient of the property (work, services) documented or by conducting an independent assessment; <br></div></div><br>  And taxed 6% tax minimum. <br><br>  In addition, in this scheme (‚Äúinformational activity‚Äù), I can only pay a deposit to a client in the form of a gift.  Up to 4,000 rubles per year is not subject to personal income tax.  Paid from net income (after taxes). <br>  If we use the object of taxation ‚Äúincome - expense‚Äù, then I need grounds for payments (not contradicting the codes of activity of OKVED), and I cannot think of them in this scheme. <br><br>  Summarizing this point. <br><ul><li>  "All through yourself."  It seems to solve problems with taxes and payments.  But something confuses me, because neither FL nor Avito did not go this way, maybe I don‚Äôt know what?  Well, the questions of paragraphs 1 and 4 of this article are not going anywhere. </li><li>  "Information Activity".  Requires complex schemes with the involvement of the "operator of electronic money" (see below, "The need for licenses") </li></ul><br><br>  <b>The need for licenses.</b>  . <br>  I have no right to accept such payments for transferring them to other people, since these are the functions of the <i>‚Äúoperator of electronic money‚Äù</i> from the law on the <abbr title="national payment system">NPC</abbr> .  So I need a license of the Central Bank. <br>  I think this is why FL uses electronic money operator, PSKV, in its ‚ÄúSafe Transaction‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Other inconveniences for customers in their implementation of escrow.</b> <br><ul><li>  I can transfer money only to personalized wallets. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  7.9.  When transferring electronic money, legal entities or individual entrepreneurs may be recipients of funds, as well as payers if the recipient of funds is an individual using electronic means of payment specified in paragraph 2 of article 10 of this Federal Law. <br><br>  10.2 <br>  2. In the event that an operator conducts an electronic cash identification of a client - an individual in accordance with Federal Law No. 115-FZ of August 7, 2001 ‚ÄúOn Countering the Legalization (Laundering) of Criminally Income and Financing of Terrorism‚Äù, an electronic means of payment is used client - an individual, provided that the balance of electronic money at any time does not exceed 100 thousand rubles, or an amount in foreign currency equivalent to 100 thousand rubles for an official  to the exchange rate of the Bank of Russia.  The specified electronic means of payment is personalized. <br></div></div><br></li><li>  Service fee. <br>  It consists of the cost of acquiring, accounting, taxes, return on investment, arbitration. <br>  Low payment of arbitration - a direct way to its corruption. <br>  Also explains such a high percentage of FL. <br><br></li><li>  Not everyone uses electronic money. <br>  Especially customers expats. <br>  And the agent who brought something to such a client would be more convenient to get money in cash.  In local currency. <br></li></ul><br><br>  As a result, the implementation of the most logical option "guarantees on the Internet" at the initial stage looks like a controversial event. <br>  Given that the outsourcing option with Webmoney escrow is deprived of most of the shortcomings (fame, commission) and allows you not to break your brain with accounting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203418/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203418/</a></p>
