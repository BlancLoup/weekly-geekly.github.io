  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top secret new.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  That night, the Microsoft division, which gave the Xbox and Zune world, will present something completely new to the world.  This is not completely clear, but ‚Äúthis is something completely new from the Entertainment and Devices division (Entertainment and Gadgets (?)), And this will change the very essence of communication between people and technology.‚Äù  E-mail (which is not just advice, rather sent to me by mistake) begins with the words "You really need to see it in order to believe."  How exciting. <br><br>  The time is excellent, because tomorrow Bill Gates and Steve Jobs will publicly cross swords, and since there are only a few days before the iPhone is released, Bill must be fully armed.  But what the hell is going to be?  We are sure that the firmware for Zune version 2.0 is only on the way, but what else can this department do?  Stay tuned, everything will become clear soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/452/a24/3dc/452a243dcb0a45506789421a7aab586e.jpg" width="450" height="153" hspace="10" vspace="10">

      <b>Stay tuned!</b>  <b>Everything will be decided soon!</b> <br><br>  Updates <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Update.  <b>Mystical gadget from Microsoft - touch table?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/4c8/2b7/67d/4c82b767dcefe986ff2e79954ae3fe1c.jpg" width="450" height="153" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  According to various sources, it should be assumed that most likely Microsoft is preparing PlayTable's ‚Äútouchscreen‚Äù as its top-secret product.  ‚ÄúShown as a concept for the Millan Project, gesture and object recognition technology that supports multi-touch is the new PlayTable,‚Äù says Mary Jo Foley of ZDnet.  Matt Hickey of CrunchGear also assumes, based on a demonstration he has seen, that this could be a touch game console that will become a competitor to Nintendo Wii. <br><br>  <b>Update 2. Another source claims that the</b> new product will most likely be a kiosk-device created for entertainment and downloading content in Zune, but at a cost of $ 10,000, this is not exactly what you can buy for your home. <br><br>  Someone else, without naming the product itself, speaks about its device as about several projectors with a resolution of 1024x768, aimed at a 23-25 ‚Äã‚Äãinch screen.  Two people (and more) will be able to use it at once, and it will be installed in casinos and other public places. <br><br>  Here are some of the supposed (for the time being) functions: <br>  1) Music - insert your player and credit card into the device.  Then, waiting for the connection, throw the song in the player.  Apparently, only Zune will be supported at first, but other partners may also be involved.  One of the demonstrations was done with nano (!).  Can Apple become a real partner?  Let's not guess ... <br>  2) Virtual Explorer - it's a sin not to use such a device to navigate through the place, you just need to embed a map into it. <br>  3) Food and Drinks - after all, this is not just an interactive menu, because it recognizes premets.  And, as in the case of music, a credit card can be simply put on the screen - it will be determined without problems. <br>  4) Photo is a simple image editor. <br>  5) Puzzle - a game in which you collect a picture from pieces of real glass, but under it a video is played in real time. <br>  6) Water - a screensaver with the surface of the water, where you can make waves with one touch. <br>  7) Drawing - a simple drawing program that takes into account the force of pressure, tracking the size of the attached surface of the fingers. <br><br>  Everyone agrees on one thing - this is very similar to OSX, and, as in the case of the Xbox and Zune, it has a very unclear positioning.  The name of the new device should be the center for a new brand.  And yet - most likely at the All Things D conference, it will not be in its final form. <br><br>  <i>From the translator - small-sized muddy water is muddy, oh muddy.</i>  <i>They do not pull rival Wii, this is a hedgehog clear.</i>  <i>Interactive tablet, even with the recognition of objects, very few people need.</i>  <i>If there is one of the above two, I‚Äôll be completely disappointed in Bill.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And, by the way, I didn‚Äôt understand a bit what I‚Äôm talking about here - ‚Äúit's very reminiscent of OSX, the Microsoft branding is lowkey.</i>  <i>Its whoever can, help =)</i> <br><br>  <b>Update 3. So, during this hour we learned</b> something else.  More and more evidence that ‚ÄúPlayTable‚Äù will officially be called the Microsoft Smart Surface, that is, the <s>Small Soft</s> Smart Surface.  (Although I prefer <s>IgroStol</s> PlayTable) <br>  The size and shape of the novelty may be different, but tomorrow's demo will be the size of a coffee table.  New sources confirm the initial information that 1) recognition of objects will require RFID tags or something like that and 2) iPod is most likely supported initially.  Apparently, one Zune is still not enough to attract a large number of users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31064/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31064/</a></p>
