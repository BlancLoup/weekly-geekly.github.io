Turkey</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/332/f36/78d/332f3678d98443baa708c13f1b8c6fb1.jpg"><br><br>  Hi, Habr.  Today I want to talk about my successful business story, which happened to me some time ago.  This story is my successful experience, recommendation to those who work in the IT field, or maybe just an interesting article.  Anyway, I hope you enjoy it.  So, let's begin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I work a lot, and every year I try to go abroad at least 2-3 times.  Probably it makes no sense to explain how important it is to rest from work and routine.  Without it, just no way.  A prerequisite for my every vacation is the sea or ocean.  A little later I will explain why it is important for me to travel closer to a little water.  I strongly advise everyone not to forget about their rest.  Despite my recommendations, I violated my principles during my last vacation, but there were reasons for this. <br><br>  From the very beginning, 2014 began to take shape for me very, very productively.  I launched my next new project, directly connected with IT, and from the very start it began to bring me fruit.  I can not explain in detail what exactly I do.  It will smell like PR.  Let's dwell on the fact that my projects are very closely connected with Internet advertising, and if it is even easier to say, we help other entrepreneurs sell more with the help of the Internet.  For several months everything went very well, I was a little tired from the routine and monotony.  As usual, I have planned a summer vacation.  Almost every year, in the summer, I go to Turkey.  Warm sea, great weather - ideal conditions for my vacation.  If earlier I went exclusively to hotels, then the last time I went to an excellent villa to my friend, who in turn is now also my partner.  By the way, my friend has been spending a lot of time in Turkey for a long time.  He has his business there related to services, now he has a lot of real estate.  Do not think that I am praising here, I will often make retreats, but all of them will end up linked to the main theme and thought.

      Upon arrival, I decided to buy a mobile Internet bundled with a wi-fi router.  Previously, he tried to abstract from the Internet and limited himself to slow wi-fi on the territory of the complex, to check social networks.  But this time the work and my projects demanded more attention.  In Turkey, an excellent 3G Internet, I used the services of the operator Turkcell (according to seller reviews, the best choice).  15 gigabytes (maximum package) cost 99 Turkish liras, which translates into our money ~ 1700 rubles.  The seller clearly wondered why I needed so much and what I plan to do with these 15GB.  Explained quickly and clearly - for work, but interested seller even more.  I had to talk and tell some details.  From the conversation, I realized that there are few IT specialists in Turkey and the market for everything connected with the industry has just begun to develop.  Okay, drove on and I'm on my way to the villa.  Three or four days of great sea and sun, and I increasingly appear on the Internet, it is already starting to break for work, and for everything that happens on the network.  I often get on YouTube, where the same pizza ad is being played all the time.  It becomes clear that there are obvious problems with video advertising in the country, there are simply no advertisers for it. <br><br>  Googling some queries that are popular in Russia, but in Turkish, it becomes clear that with contextual advertising, everything is just as bad.  At this moment, I was visited by the feeling that I was where I needed and here I could earn very decent money.  I closed my laptop, took my air mattress, swam to the buoys as usual, where I liked to think, and began to think about how to proceed.  The first correct thought is that there is an urgent need to work here.  The second thought - you need to start the registration of the company and score on vacation right now.  Returning to his apartment, immediately began to study the process of registering a company.  Everything is very simple and inexpensive, but it takes time, which I don‚Äôt have (2-4 weeks for registration).  I was rescued by my friend, he already had several legal entities on the territory of the country, analogues of our LLC.  Having described the situation and prospects a bit, I agreed that I would work for some time on behalf of his companies. <br><br>  On the same day I rented a car.  By the way, the cost of 95 gasoline, translated into rubles - ~ 85 rubles per liter!  But almost everyone drives diesel - ~ 75rub / liter.  One of the most, if not the highest price in the world (in Europe for sure).  As explained to me, it is connected with the fact that there is a lot of agriculture in the country, and it is difficult to achieve normal tax payments for people who live closer to the mountains, so taxes were simply included in the price of fuel.  It is logical and correct, but I do not know how much all this is true.  I have a car, a company with a bank account too. <br><br>  On the same day, or rather, it was almost night, I strained our engineer to hire a translator, who quickly translated the site into Turkish.  Everything was ready, it remains only to find customers in an empty market.  I felt that everything could work out, my friend supported me and said that the Turks are very business people.  I could only hope. <br><br>  <i>(The photo I took in the local market confirmed the words of my friend)</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d30/ad8/7df/d30ad87dfc7b40fa8f8ed860ec50fa85.jpg"><br><br>  In the morning I woke up and immediately got down to business.  I went to the nearest more or less large city (Alanya).  I decided to have breakfast and at the same time try to cram my services right where I‚Äôll have breakfast.  For this, I found a cafe that looked like a private business, and not like any kind of network, but at the same time was civilized.  It was a small restaurant where pasta was cooked with you.  When I logged in, the first thing I asked was if you had a website?  I nodded proudly.  I handed over my tablet and asked to drive in its url.  The page was loaded for a long time - and it would be better if it did not load.  What I saw was horror.  I'll post it right here.  Yes, yes, I was not mistaken, below you see a full-fledged site of a Turkish restaurant.  It is so cool that it fits in one picture: <br><br>  <i>( <a href="http://www.uknoodle.com/">http://www.uknoodle.com/</a> - whole site with one picture)</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7b/9c0/546/c7b9c054616e47d8943994c7b58a061a.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, the pasta was not very tasty, in Moscow, at times better!  Yes, and the seller to persuade to "try" to run an advertisement for the delivery of his paste and I could not accept orders via the Internet.  It was probably embarrassing that I highly recommended making the site better.  I was a little upset, but I never give up, especially at the first failure.  Sitting in my rented car I began to look for other restaurants, or rather, purposefully already searched for such companies that have a working delivery or at least some price list of their products on their personal website.  Basically everyone had terrible sites, but there were exceptions.  For example, <a href="http://www.dominos.com.tr/">www.dominos.com.tr</a> .  Great design and functionality, I found it quickly, they did great work and already did online advertising, at least the context from AdWords worked.  I was pleased with one thing, I did not see more Internet advertising of food delivery. <br><br>  After sitting for an hour in the car, a base was assembled from 20 food-related companies that were located in the same city.  I will not long describe each of my meetings.  I offered very favorable conditions, payment after the first customers.  And to my happiness, I found a common language with 2 restaurants.  They had mediocre sites, delivery (judging by the stories of the owners) also works, but is not in demand practically at all.  Advertising was organized and after a few days I received payments to a bank account as a sign of a successful advertising campaign.  The amounts were small, it was just the beginning. <br><br>  Then my friend and I began to go around his partners with whom he worked or worked.  Companies from different fields, everyone went to the contact, I showed our website, said that I was already working in Turkey, and that I was doing excellent advertising.  Everyone was very interested, I signed a lot of contracts, some for very good sums.  I began to offer to make a beautiful site for free, provided that a certain amount was spent on advertising.  My business worked perfectly, the low competition of online advertising in all areas was doing its job. <br><br>  Advertising gave indicators that I have never achieved in Russia.  Then we started driving around the hotels.  All.  Fortunately, there are a lot of them in Turkey.  We talked with the managers, left their contacts, they gave them to the management.  And even so, we managed to attract customers. <br><br>  Every day I worked, very tired.  But the sea is a great source of energy.  That is why it is important to rest on closer to any water.  I noticed this a long time ago: a week spent at sea, the best rest for your body and an excellent charge for several months of work.  Every night I went to lie in the water and look at the starry sky.  There is nothing better than this moment.  You may think this is not true or self-hypnosis, but after 15 minutes spent in the water, you no longer feel tired at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a9/b2a/e8f/6a9b2ae8ff7049fda29e5c9194de7134.jpg"><br><br>  Now I clearly understand why such companies as Yandex pay great attention to countries with poorly developed Internet and IT infrastructure in general.  They know where to work.  To all those who work in IT, urgently go to Turkey and expand your business.  They now really need web designers, advertising specialists, SEO, SMO and so on.  In Turkey, very cheap food and accommodation, especially when there is not a season.  October is the perfect time to go and start working.  The sea is warm and you can safely swim in it almost all year round.  I have now come to settle some affairs, and will soon return to work. <br><br>  I hope you were interested.  I can still tell a lot of interesting stories and share my experience.  Successes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237293/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237293/</a></p>
