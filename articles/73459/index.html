And this very much prevents a nursing baby from sleeping, who sniffs around me almost at his side.  As a result, you can spend more time on laying than on solving this problem)

      At one time I put white wallpapers on my desktop - the combination of ‚ÄúWin ‚Äã‚Äã+ D‚Äù helped to ‚Äúlight up‚Äù the keyboard for more or less comfortable typing, but I soon got tired of it ‚Äî the white crane was blind when it wasn‚Äôt necessary.  I found another solution - ‚ÄúWin ‚Äã‚Äã+ R, Enter‚Äù, which launched the last application - as a rule, it was a registry editor or a notepad) <br><br>  I decided to do a little life hacking - to highlight the tabletop on which the keyboard was located.  Everything about everything took 10 minutes. <br><br>  <b>We will need</b> : <br>  - Neon lamp (of any color, I took white) with an inverter; <br>  - A wire for lengthening the lamp wire; <br>  - Soldering iron; <br>  - Double sided tape; <br>  - Free power connector on the motherboard. <br><br>  So, first you need to decide on a lamp - I had 5 of them (monotonous neons and tricolor plasma).  Having estimated how it will be in the night, I realized that the tricolor will not work - I stopped on a white stick (in case you need to take a picture in the dark, at least of some quality, at least there will be white light). <br><br>  An inverter was supplied with it (as a rule, it allows you to connect two lamps at once).  The wire to the motherboard's motherboard was very short - I didn‚Äôt have enough of it to skip under the table.  I had to extend) connected - it works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e73/a38/0b7/e73a380b730150cc5cc126b636badaad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also in the kit is often a set of velcro - one part is attached to the table, the second to the tabletop.  I used them, and the inverter itself also stuck to the table on the double-sided tape.  Council leading dog breeders - do not cut a similar tape with "workers" or my mother's favorite scissors - to clean the blade can be very difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f83/616/719/f83616719604591de87e9e05edebf2fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f1a/edc/a97/f1aedca9782e0c9388244f8dca7982fd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The switch for the neon also hung on the tape right at the keyboard - no need to go far.  Expensive lamps (such as Sunbeam) come with a separate panel (on which the button is located) for the computer, which can be inserted into the back of any free slot.  But in my media center there is no such luxury) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/139/466/2e9/1394662e92da94f1d8e3f51a763275b1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I agree, it would be possible to get by with a small fluorescent lamp - but I was too lazy to get out of the den, and the neon would then have been completely out of work.  By the way, I have such a lamp - it would not physically fit under the table ... and this despite the fact that the keyboard is thinner than many others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4e3/fea/7b2/4e3fea7b24a2555ce1c45a0a4e342d3b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  My problems are not understandable to those who have no family and can enjoy their acoustics even late at night.  Nevertheless, such a trick can be useful not only for family people, but also simply for those who have such a lack of light. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d9/747/3db/2d97473db894f9c9729e669a34eb5a56.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><s>(who will be the first to guess that this green one glows in the corner on the left - that + in karma)</s></i> <br><br>  Of the alternatives - use a backlit keyboard or various flashlights.  Here the choice is wide, but I can hardly tear my diNovo from my heart) <br><br>  To put it another way - a small problem was decided - now the family is sleeping peacefully and I do not break my eyes in the dark.  Let it be a small gift for my beloved one <a href="">.</a>  The microblogger has pleased more - he has taken the first steps;) Ozhelomissimo. <br><br>  By the way, my <a href="http://twitter.com/Boomburum/">twitter</a> ) there will be interesting announcements. <br><br>  <b>Successes and family understanding!</b>  ) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73459/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73459/</a></p>
