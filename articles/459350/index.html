About this user <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/6577">writes a</a> bikeoid in one of the error messages on GiHub'e.  As one of the possible solutions to the problem, it is proposed to use the <code>not:brand:wikidata=</code> tag, thus avoiding the re-addition of the tag.  Quincy Morgan (one of two iD developers) notes that before using a tag, it must first be approved according to OSM rules. </li><li>  The decision of the iD developers to support the use of the <code>natural=water</code> tag paired with the <code>water=reservoir</code> tag instead of the <code>landuse=reservoir</code> tag led to a <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/6589">discussion</a> on GitHub.  The decision itself is not new - it was made <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5591">in December 2018</a> </li><li>  Emily Eros from the <a href="https://www.sharedstreets.io/">SharedStreets</a> project <a href="https://www.sharedstreets.io/">has</a> published a large and detailed <a href="https://medium.com/sharedstreets/openstreetmap-and-curb-regulations-7812ee582a33">article</a> on the use and regulation of parking along the streets (roadside), which has recently been increasingly worrying business and local authorities.  In the material, she notes that at present OSM practically lacks such data, she also wonders why this happened.  Emily Eros examines the current state of affairs, draws attention to some difficulties and suggests new ways to add such information. </li><li>  Joseph Eisenberg turned on the ‚ÄúTagging‚Äù mailing list after two new sections were added to the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice">Good Practices</a> wiki page.  He considered that the new sections (‚ÄúChecking the history of important objects‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo not mark insignificant, fixed for a long time and moving objects‚Äù) duplicate existing sections, and therefore deleted them. </li><li>  Leif Rasmussen <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2019-July/046356.html">said</a> that the voting has begun for the elaborated <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/Connectivity">tagging scheme for</a> complex intersections, which will make it possible to contribute more information about the connectivity of the road lanes. </li><li>  <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2019-June/046322.html">Approved</a> tag <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:tourism%3Dcamp_pitch"><code>tourism=camp_pitch</code></a> , which now marked the place of installation of tents and a camper on the territory of campgrounds. </li><li>  Russian osmer Pavel Gavrilov wrote a large and detailed article on WikiOSM about how <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/RU:Strava">Strava</a> data can help make OSM more accurate. </li></ul><br><h2>  Community </h2><br><ul><li>  The OSMF data working group <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2019-June/082747.html">reports</a> that it has hidden several entries in the OSM diaries, as there were offensive remarks in the comments to them. </li><li>  The local branch of OSM in Germany (FOSSGIS e.V.) <a href="https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D66615">stated</a> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/455/9e9/497/4559e9497dff69fb7d72ff234cfb1fd5.svg" alt="(de)">  (automatic <a href="https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D66615">translation</a> ) that is ready to financially support the mapping in honor of the 15th birthday of OpenStreetMap, which will be held on 10-11 August 2019. </li><li>  Chris Beddow of Mapillary <a href="https://blog.mapillary.com/update/2019/06/26/end-of-maps-as-we-know-it.html">writes</a> on his blog about OSM development, his communities and cartographic technologies.  He concludes that all participants in the project, from a regular cartographer to commercial companies, should interact more closely and productively with each other. </li><li>  At the request of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxar_Technologies">Maxar</a> (the founders of the Digital Globe service, which is currently in the rebranding stage), the list of satellite images that are allowed to render objects in OSM has changed in the OSM editors.  The reasons for this can be found in the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/%40kevin_bullock/diary/390153">diary</a> of Maxar employee <a href="https://twitter.com/kevin_bullock">Kevin Bullock</a> .  Probably, almost all the regular participants of the OSM project noticed that instead of satellite images of Digital Globe, Maxar appeared - Standart and Premium.  By the way, they are pretty fresh.  This news concerns not only OSM online editors, but also JOSM, into which these layers will be integrated until the end of July.  It is important to note that in iD Digital Globe was removed at the <a href="https://github.com/osmlab/editor-layer-index/pull/680">request of</a> Brian House. </li><li>  At the beginning of June, the <a href="https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D66423">June Floors</a> campaign took place in Russia.  For a whole week (06/03/2019-10.06.2019), the Russian OSM community indicated the floors to those objects where they were not installed.  184 people took part in the action.  The floors were refined at 7643 objects. </li></ul><br><h2>  OpenStreetMap Foundation </h2><br><ul><li>  The user SeverinGeo wrote an <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/osmf-talk/2019-June/006099.html">e-mail</a> to OSMF, as well as a message to the ‚ÄúConversations‚Äù mailing list, in which he suggested that very few people take the <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/w/images/6/62/Organised_Editing_Guidelines.pdf">‚ÄúGuidelines for Organized Editing‚Äù</a> seriously.  Currently, the <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2019-June/thread.html">discussion of</a> this issue has begun, and ways are being sought to change the current situation.  By the way, all current organized editing activities should be noted <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities">here</a> . </li><li>  Gregory Marler <a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2019/06/25/host-sotm/">published a post</a> on his blog titled ‚ÄúWhy Your Community Should Take a State of the Map,‚Äù in which, as the name suggests, he explains why you need to host this conference in your city or country. </li></ul><br><h2>  Developments </h2><br><ul><li>  Twitter's OpenStreetMap <a href="https://twitter.com/openstreetmap/status/1144379891875557376">recalls</a> how the <em>‚ÄúState of the Map Latam 2018‚Äù</em> conference was held in Argentina, as well as announcing similar events of this year.  <a href="https://sotm.osmargentina.org/"><em>SoTM Argentina</em></a> this year will be held on July 27 in Santa Fe, and <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_of_the_Map_Latam_2019"><em>SotM Latam</em></a> in Paraguay in November. </li><li>  Published video from the conference <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLOOscafdiYWMiCr9ae8F-ttCKmfeBX8Yk">"SotM CZ / SK"</a> (Czech Republic / Slovenia) 2016. </li></ul><br><h2>  Humanitarian OSM </h2><br><ul><li>  The organization ‚ÄúDoctors without Borders‚Äù is <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/hot/2019-June/014918.html">looking for</a> helpers for carrying out two cartatons in Hong Kong: August 5 and September 1. </li><li>  The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rtuzOhilMS8VdB1_XG8vVoga4e-qJnMd/view">minutes of the</a> meeting of the HOT organization council dated June 13, 2019 are published. </li></ul><br><h2>  Cards </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.kontur.io/">Kontur has</a> created a map of the <a href="http://disaster.ninja/live/">density of</a> objects in OSM per unit of population.

She was presented at the French conference <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolas_chavent/status/1139813028034162688">SotM-Fr 2019</a> not so long ago.  Its work is constructed by comparing the available data in OSM with open data sets, for example, such as <a href="https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/groads">gROADS</a> .  To search for areas that need improvement, the <a href="https://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1245">project manager</a> and task <a href="http://u.osmfr.org/m/274667/">prioritization</a> in the uMap service are used.  Developers ask everyone <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/hot/2019-June/014906.html">to take</a> part in this project.  It was launched in 2015 and is currently being implemented in nine African countries.

The mining community was abandoned in 1983, but the houses, the land, the hospital, and the shops have since been maintained by an investor (helped by several local residents) for the next generation of miners.
