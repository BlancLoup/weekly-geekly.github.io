  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is wrong with qip distribution?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inspired by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/im/66209/">this</a> post and is an <a href="http://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3DThe%2BBig%2BBang%2BTheory">unfiltered stream of consciousness</a> . <br>  I myself have not been a qip user for a long time, as soon as I went to linux, however many friends and not-so-many people use this client and equate two completely different concepts: <b>im client</b> and <b>im network</b> .  Naturally, in this case, I mean the classical equating among many: <b>icq = qip</b> , when these words become interchangeable, it is worth noting both in the minds of the ‚Äúaccountant‚Äù and in the minds of fairly tech-savvy people. <br>  Actually, such an equation is very close to the fact that ‚Äúa computer without windows is not a computer‚Äù, which has been slowly and surely sitting in people's brains for the past ... for many years. <br>  But is it so bad that people do not think about "which client to choose"?  Writing a dozen of links to different icq / multiplatform clients and finally adding ‚Äú <i>well, go to jabber</i> ‚Äù, at best, will end up with another ‚Äúkrosavcheg‚Äù saying: ‚ÄúGo to qip.ru (Q, I, P as Russian), and then everything will be clear. " <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Or maybe it was not necessary to "help" at all? </h4><br><br>  And if our ‚Äúclient‚Äù takes advantage of our help, then either: <br>  <b>1)</b> downloads the first link (and we, as a habrarad, obviously, give the link in the first line, for example, to <b>pidgin</b> , but not to <b>qip</b> ) and then the "defochka" will pester with questions like: " <i>How do I register in icq?</i> ", " <i>And this is not icq?</i> ‚Äù, Which will be preceded by a thousand questions:‚Äú <i>Where should I click so that% subj%</i> ‚Äù <br>  <b>2)</b> or take advantage of our advice about jabber and (after the analogous to clause 1, hundreds of questions) ask the following question: ‚Äú <i>How do I write to my girlfriend ... does she have the number <b>zxcvbzmxw</b> ?</i> ‚Äù, Which will lead to the explanation that ‚Äúnow come here, choose transport, chose?  And now ... Well, now we‚Äôll register icq for you ‚Äù, but still,‚Äú defochka ‚Äù, after a couple of days after seeing that the girlfriend‚Äôs program is‚Äú completely different, ‚Äùhe will ruthlessly forget about your advice and set yourself a <b>qip</b> (no matter what)

      <br>
    <h4>  And what is the result? </h4><br><br>  As a result, everything, in any case, <b>will end with installing qip</b> , but what is so bad in the end?  Let's move away from the informative history of "defochka" and look at the users in general.  These are not geeks who understand that in many ways icq is a flawed protocol, not those people who are forced (exactly forced) in parallel with the jabber to keep accounts on msn and icq ... they are simple people. <br><br><h4>  And if we find ourselves on the spot "defochki"?  (or the example of Napoleon) </h4><br><br>  In the end, if you move away and go back to another area - how many of us will want to understand some kind of problem?  You wanted to get a cake, but from the culinary past, just remember how to make an egg?  Yes, and in a short time it is necessary to do: ‚ÄúThe guests will come here‚Äù ... so what?  Having received several answers on the similarity: ‚ÄúFirst make the dough‚Äù, ‚ÄúBuy cakes‚Äù ... as a result, you will get semolina (yes I know that there is no dough in it, but I don‚Äôt know if I will make the dough ... suddenly, instead of flour, I put ?), or I will go and buy a ready-made ‚ÄúNapoleon‚Äù ... and the first version itself will result in the same purchase of the finished cake as a result. <br><br><h4>  Claiming Cleverness </h4><br><br>  So, people really do <b>not</b> want to get a <b>way</b> that others feel <b>better</b> , <b>but a</b> short sequence of actions that will be <b>easier</b> for them <b>and will bring fewer problems</b> .  And it does not matter: we need a cake or we "put icq".  A person needs a result achieved with less effort, in the end, who prevents to say in response to: ‚ÄúI need to put icq!‚Äù Something like ‚ÄúWell, come here: <a href="http://qip.ru/">qip.ru</a> , and then read about Jabber at your leisure‚Äù - yes, this will attract a lot of people, but many will be wondering what kind of jabber is this ... <br><br><h4>  Well, you say, qip evil? </h4><br><br>  And so, what is the result of such a bad thing is that people ( <i>and right now, for example, ~ 80% of my icq contact list</i> ) use qip?  Nothing wrong with that!  Why does he deserve from our side statements like " <i>qvip evil</i> "?  (I admit, I myself constantly used this phrase.) In the end, the qip <b>developers</b> made an infium, but also because of this massive nonsense with the " <i>loss of passwords</i> ", with statements that " <i>you don‚Äôt want to see your messages in some kind of <b>microblog,</b></i> "people remain on the old branch ... but I consider it bad - thus we provoke people, force them to use (as we see it)" <i>defective technology</i> ", and maybe with the transition to a new <b>qip</b> , people would realized the power of the same "chatting" <b>jabber</b> 'and? <br><br>  <b>PS I</b> myself, for the classic reason, stay on a bunch of icq + jabber - I don‚Äôt want to set myself a jabber to talk to me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66298/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66298/</a></p>
