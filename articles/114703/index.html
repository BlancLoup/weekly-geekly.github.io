  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Books in the Web 2.0 era</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I now ride the subway a little.  And I feel nostalgic sadness because I used to read on the subway.  In the car, it is inconvenient and even dangerous to read, and audiobooks and podcasts do not allow you to fully immerse yourself in the author's thought - you still need to drive a car. <br>  But I rejoice as a publisher - others read the subway!  Moreover, as it turned out recently, they are reading more and more in electronic form, managing to carry dozens and even hundreds of books with them at the same time.  And in each car and such readers at least 2-3 rides.  With book readers, tablet PCs and smartphones. <br><br>  Here is a high-tech trend in the field of reading.  At one of the conferences devoted to e-book publishing, I heard the following conspiracy explanation of the situation.  All this is intrigue: someone intends to destroy paper books, newspapers, magazines and redraw the entire printed media market.  Firstly, the manufacturers of portable electronics, competing for us with you, are releasing more and more sophisticated and cheap gadgets. <br>  Secondly, mobile operators have built data networks and are now thinking with all their might, how to make us use their gadgets to download their traffic.  The marketing and pr-efforts of these companies put together is a formidable force.  This, by the way, is hundreds of millions of dollars in the budget only for Russia! <br>  They all together actively provoke the emergence of new forms of content and soon there will be no books, newspapers and magazines, to which we have become accustomed.  What a nightmare‚Ä¶ <br><br>  It's funny, but still, what kind of universal electronization gives us opportunities and how can things that we are used to change?  First of all books. <br>  Suppose we have a tablet computer that is perfect in terms of performance, and the ‚Äúthick‚Äù Internet is always on. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Option # 1: Availability </h4><br>  Obviously, virtually any texts found on the Internet (the issue of copyright, creation and hacking of protection, etc., are deliberately bypassing) become available directly from the device, that is, you can find something on the spot to read something about your mood, recommendation or link . <br>  The book itself migrates from a static source of information, once printed long ago, in the direction of the portal for access to the ocean of information; it is only important to know the right resource and be able to correctly formulate the request. <br><br><h4>  Option # 2: Transmedia </h4><br>  We are used to how?  Reading a book is one thing, and opening a newspaper / magazine, turning on a radio, TV, getting on the Internet, playing is another.  Now everything is on one device and very close.  And these formats are trying to invade one another: product development, Wikileaks, online encyclopedias, Internet maps, video blogs, podcasts, online games ... <br>  Book content can acquire a range of additional dimensions.  There is an opportunity, without setting aside the book, to consider the chosen fragment of it. <br>  ‚Ä¢ In the event-historical context - the place mentioned in the book, the character, the event - where is it located, what is known about it, when and under what circumstances did it occur? <br>  ‚Ä¢ In the context of the audiovisual - what is being said about it, what are the images, photographs, feature films, documentaries, news and amateur, associated with this fragment;  what are the training courses on this topic. <br>  ‚Ä¢ In the context of the consumer - where and for how much you can buy the described product, service or its equivalent.  In addition, the audio version of the book can be linked to its text version, which allows you to switch from reading to listening and back without losing the thread of the story. <br><br><h4>  Opportunity number 3: the socialization of experiences </h4><br>  Suppose you don‚Äôt want to learn anything further, but you want to discuss sharing;  and here, and with those who read the same thing. <br>  The book can be equipped with a "layer" of comments by those who read it or are currently reading all over the world in different languages, and the comments can be compared with a specific moment, plot or character - in the case of a work of art or with theory, reasoning, methodology or postulate - in the case of nonfiction <br><br><h4>  Opportunity number 4: "2.0" </h4><br>  An interesting thing is the electronic samizdat, especially the collective one.  Suppose you are writing a book and publishing it in parts on a blog.  You have several options for the further development of the plot, and you just can not decide.  There is an opportunity to interview readers what will happen next, and calmly write, already knowing the expectations of the audience (and it‚Äôs not at all necessary to strive to please it). <br>  Or, for example, you are a reader, dissatisfied with how the book ended.  "Afftar zhhot", but not as much as they could.  Write an alternative version, notifying the community reading this book with you. <br><br>  By the way, to be consistent, then ‚Äú2.0‚Äù is ‚Äú2.0‚Äù.  What other opportunities do you think there are? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114703/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114703/</a></p>
