  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We optimize working time, experiment. Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A month has passed, as I began to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/83552/">reset the time on the cell before going to bed at 00:00</a> .  I do it with one goal - to spend my time rationally.  The main reason for this idea is a downed work schedule.  I can sleep during the day and work at night, I can sleep at night and work during the day and work patterns can change every day.  Today I have a feather and I haven‚Äôt slept for two days, but I don‚Äôt have a prune, I played, started to sleep and fell asleep in the middle of the day.  And every "morning", opening his eyes, it is difficult to understand where, what, when?  During the day it is difficult to settle down to the global time.  What do I have now?  Lunch or dinner?  When did I wake up? <br>  Knocking the clock at 00:00 before going to bed and setting the alarm at 06:30, I solved the problem of time tracking by creating a local, dynamic ‚Äútime‚Äù. <br>  A month has passed and I can share my impressions. <br>  First of all, the whole month, without missing a day, I knocked down the clock when I went to bed.  Whether I worked at home or went on business to other cities, I always woke up after an alarm clock at 06:30 or 08:30.  And I am not going to give up this occupation, because  I realized for myself that this is very good.  conveniently.  Personally for me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Secondly, it became really more convenient to navigate in time.  Frankly, at the moment I use the local clock only to find out the middle of the day and how much is left until the end of the day.  I did not notice this earlier, but now I see that most often from 20:00 to 24:00 local time I suffer from garbage, especially if there is no prune.  Those.  essentially not doing anything.  He noted that usually from 06:30 to 07:00 I wash and read the news.  Strange, before it seemed that it takes much more time.  And, which is very important for me, I began to impose meals on a local time.  Now I know when to eat, in order not to clog the esophagus, but at the same time to activate my biological machine - the body. <br>  Thirdly, brought order in time.  If earlier the time periods for me were chaos, now I know exactly how long it takes me to write and do the dishes, how much time I spend on charging, how much to work.  I didn‚Äôt write anything down until now, but I‚Äôm thinking about it, but I‚Äôm already thinking about making a schedule.  Remember how in childhood =) at 07:00 the rise of itp =)) I used to make them up before, but I never lived on them =) make it easier than follow the schedule and earlier I made them just like that.  Now I feel the need and, most importantly, the ability to precisely follow the schedule. <br>  Accordingly, not hard.  And, say, the schedule of eating, working, relaxing. <br><br>  In general, in a month I will report on how and what is being received / is not received =) If someone followed my example, it will be interesting to read the comments. <br><br>  ps oh my God, I almost forgot =) Dear ladies =) Happy holiday to you!  Be just as beautiful and smile more often! </div>
