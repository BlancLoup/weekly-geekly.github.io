  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scientists have no evidence that standing up is better than sitting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If scientists know something about what type of desktop in the office is the best in terms of employee health, it is that they do not know anything.  This fact is confirmed by a detailed analysis of 20 of the highest quality research, where standing jobs, workplaces by bicycle simulators and treadmills were checked.  Scientists do not have enough data to say that any of these options are better than an office chair and a regular desk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cbd/c06/186/cbdc06186f649c1f2c4f41279fb75df8.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The amount of time people spend sitting while working has recently increased.  Long periods of inactivity lead to obesity, heart problems and increased mortality.  A team of scientists <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD010912/OCCHEALTH_workplace-interventions-reducing-sitting-time-work">checked the results of research</a> on changing the type of workplace.  The basis was taken 20 studies made before June 2, 2015.  The total number of participants is 2174 people of different nationalities.  Nine studies examined physical changes in the workplace, four - changes in workplace policy, seven - evaluated informational and consulting activities, and one combined such activities with physical changes in the workplace. <br><br>  Work tables, allowing you to alternate work sitting and standing, reduced the amount of time spent in a sitting position by one and a half to two hours a day.  When consulting and informational events were added to this method, the total amount of sitting time and the duration of ‚Äúsedentary‚Äù periods of 30 minutes were reduced.

And the cycling simulator, to which informational events were added, showed no effect compared to the groups where only such events were held. <br><br>  The introduction to the work day walks during the breaks was made in two studies with 443 participants.  The amount of time spent sitting has not changed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d2/130/60d/7d213060dc47ad30991e75d537f60e60.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  In two studies where people were told about the dangers of inactivity, the amount of sitting time decreased by 28 minutes.  Another study on mindfulness did not show the effect of this practice. <br><br>  Two studies checked the software, reminding of the need to get up and walk - in them this software did not affect the result.  In another study, the time was reduced by 55 minutes compared with no intervention.  The software did not change the number of sedentary periods lasting half an hour. <br><br>  In studies where several methods of intervention were combined, a decrease in the amount of sitting time occurred during periods from 12 weeks to 6 months, for an interval of 12 months there was no difference between these groups and control groups that continued to work without interventions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/646/c2d/78d/646c2d78d7ed421dac758d9304feaac4.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/252360/">LeanChair chair for standing upright</a> <br><br>  According to the authors of the comparative study, the quality of the evidence base was low, the studies were poorly developed and had a small number of participants.  At the moment, it cannot be said that any intervention in the usual work in the office will lead to better health. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392003/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392003/</a></p>
