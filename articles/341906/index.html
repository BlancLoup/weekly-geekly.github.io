  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We select the supplier of IT solutions and keep the sanity</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Information technologies, as a dozen or so years, have become an integral part of any business.  Doing business without the use of software is now in principle impossible.  While the business is small - consists of the founder, the accountant and a couple of employees, they have enough tables in Excel or oral instructions.  But as soon as the company begins to grow, the need for specialized software increases dramatically.  There is another situation when the company is engaged in some specialized projects or a large and extremely important client appears for the welfare of the whole team.  And to service this client, again, you need specialized software, whose capabilities go far beyond MS Office. <br><br>  At this moment, any business (someone earlier, someone later) is faced with a dilemma: start their own development department, the size of which may exceed the current size of the company, or look for ready-made solutions on the side.  And here begins either a painful search for qualified developers, or a no less painful search for adequate software vendors.  Our project - ROI4CIO - solves the second problem: it helps the consumer to find his supplier.  In this publication, we will briefly explain why we are needed and what we want to share with the community on the issue of purchasing IT solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ot/qd/co/otqdcocxfi2l4mn8arypcluhtoa.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#808080"><em>Typical negotiations with the supplier.</em></font>  <font color="#808080"><em>Canvas, oil.</em></font>  <font color="#808080"><em>(Original: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBKorP55Aqvg">"The Expert", 2014</a> )</em></font>

      So, imagine that you are an enterprise that is looking for a new ASED solution for your organization.  Of course, the chief accountant, along with his gang, slightly resists, as they have bought 1C and paper orders ten years ago, but the rest of the organization is mired in endless jambs, misunderstandings, and those very paper orders that have the unpleasant property of "losing" Something on the table.  It is definitely impossible to live like that, because 2017 is already ending.  And so, you start looking. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Obviously, you will first go through free solutions: what do we have there?  Well, well, well.  Online does not suit you - the amounts in the tariffs of your provider are similar to the full record of the number of UIs, and on the current one at the whole office, the page will not load at once, and the PC fleet cannot be called ultramodern.  Again, if you force your boobs - aunts in their business powerful, but extremely inert - also go to the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù, then everything will become completely sad.  They already barely mastered the correspondence in instant messengers, and now they terrorize you with stickers.  Plus, you immediately get a request from your "bezopasnik" to deploy everything on your own server, all the same, now it is mainly the admin file. <br><br>  We refuse online solutions (without knowing that the service of each user in excess of 10 people will cost $ 8-15 per month) and start looking for something really serious, big and even ‚Äúfor growth‚Äù.  And there are just a lot of options.  Solutions from 1C, some kind of ‚ÄúChancellors‚Äù and ‚ÄúDirectorate‚Äù, but at least MS Dynamic CRM or, what the hell is not joking, Jira (well, the whole world uses the same bug tracker as you like, just not as intended, are we worse?) . <br><br>  At this point, it would seem, the story is over, but when you start to understand what the software manufacturer offers out of the box, you realize that this typical solution does not suit you.  Well, of course, it would be possible to put up with it, but the budget was allocated, and it was solid, and the goal was to be done once and for the next five to ten years, as was the case with 1C for accounting. <br><br>  A conditional purchaser of a conditional ERMS or any other system begins to look for a supplier - someone who can ‚Äúassemble‚Äù this boxed designer into a product that is really needed by the business.  Of course, there are suppliers who simply resell licenses, but the lion's share of them offers favorable tariffs for one workstation plus, for a certain amount, ‚Äúdoping‚Äù of the system for the needs of the company and even follow-up support. <br><br>  Here, it seems you need this solution, but the supplier requires you to purchase at least 100 licenses, and you need 50. And this supplier offers 50 licenses you need, but it does not have system support.  And this cycle of ‚Äúcomparison of sentences‚Äù can occur without end.  Dozens of price lists and various configurations, tons of correspondence with salespeople of suppliers and other amenities can delay the purchase and implementation process for months.  Of course, it would be possible to hold a tender, but in this case it‚Äôs not a fact that the supplier wins, who does everything qualitatively - your organization is ready to pay a little more, but for a quality solution, there is no goal to save every penny. <br><br>  It is for such stalemate situations, when the consumer seems to know what he needs, but cannot choose from a dozen offers on the market, we created our ROI4CIO service. <br><br>  In fact, our service helps the buyer to select the necessary configuration of the software solution he needs and, at the exit, to get an adequate list of suppliers that fully meet his requirements based on their price lists and other materials.  Schematically, the principle of the service can be displayed as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5v/gt/ej/5vgtejxivpimd7wwyeslyve3vae.jpeg"><br>  At the same time, we believe that the service will be useful not only to the consumer, but also to the sales department of a supplier who can unload his managers and automate the process of offering services.  Whoever was engaged in sales knows that sometimes many months of negotiations and correspondence translate into ‚Äúwell, so you don‚Äôt approach us!‚Äù, And you won‚Äôt return the lost time. <br><br>  Now our project is in the stage of open testing and we <b><a href="https://roi4cio.com/">invite readers to poke buttons</a></b> and give our team feedback.  Frankness is welcome.  In subsequent publications, we will describe in more detail how ROI4CIO was created and works, how the process of purchasing IT solutions and software is organized, and what pitfalls you may encounter. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341906/</a></p>
