  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SSD VPS from REG.RU: combine the merits</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e9/0fc/513/5e90fc513a5b45f9a27097dac8633a82.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#000"><b>VPS / VDS: for whom is this type of hosting?</b></font> </h2><br>  Anyone who needs to create and develop their own website, sooner or later comes to the need to acquire hosting for it.  Most people understand hosting as shared-hosting, that is, virtual, when several sites simultaneously use the resources of the same server.  The advantages of such hosting are obvious: the minimum of worries about its support and configuration, the lion‚Äôs share of these works falls on the hosting provider. <a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2e/54b/03c/e2e54b03c6db4e93998a284169960d6a.jpg" align="left"><br>  However, most projects will soon become crowded as part of shared hosting.  Restrictions on the use of shared resources, coupled with the inability to configure all server components for the needs of this particular site, lead to the need to use hosting, where the user has much more opportunities to configure all the necessary components. <br>  VPS (Virtual Private Server) or VDS (Virtual Dedicated Server) - now these terms have become almost synonymous - are a convenient alternative to shared hosting.  The user gets at his disposal a virtual server, which is very close in terms of its ability to configure and install the necessary software components to a physical (dedicated) server, which provides maximum freedom in configuration and configuration, but at the same time costs significantly more. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a79/4d6/4ee/a794d64eeb5c4facaf04844e64a52909.jpg"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#000"><b>Magnetic Hard Drives and Solid State Drives</b></font> </h2><br>  Hard drives that use magnetic materials to store data have been known for several decades.  In fact, this kind of drive is meant when they say "hard disk".  Despite the ever-increasing speed of data exchange and the amount of available disk space, these drives are limited in the number of simultaneously performed operations, as well as in the rate of exchange. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/add/398/93f/add39893fb214831a12a029905c23f17.jpg" align="right"><br>  Solid state drives (SSD) remove a number of restrictions, which had to be considered the owners of magnetic drives.  First of all, any part of the SSD-drive can be accessed for a fixed time.  At the same time, you can make thousands, tens, hundreds of thousands (depending on the drive model) read-write operations, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than the capabilities of hard drives.  Add to this a very low power consumption (SSD-drive can consume several watts of power, thus reducing power consumption and reducing the heating of the system unit) and absolute noiselessness (since there are no moving parts in the SSD). <br><br>  Of the shortcomings of SSD, it is possible to note a relatively high price compared to hard drives.  Contrary to popular belief, the time between failures of modern SSD drives is not inferior to the typical hard disk.

    <h2>  <font color="#000"><b>SSD VPS from REG.RU: combine the merits</b></font> </h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f23/acc/bac/f23accbacc9f4354bad80b0c40a3b11f.jpg" align="left"><br>  REG.RU has combined the advantages of these technologies and offers its customers hosting on VPS, using solid-state drives (SSD) for storing information.  How can this type of hosting be convenient for you?  First of all, speed.  If your site uses applications that work intensively with a hard disk (such as database servers, high-powered Web servers, etc.), this will significantly increase their performance ‚Äî can eliminate one of the bottlenecks of your site: fast enough operations read and write to disk. <br><br>  It should be noted quite acceptable price range for high-speed SSD VPS.  Most users who have experienced the benefits of working on SSD, no longer return to traditional media for storing and recording information. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e0/7a4/0f3/8e07a40f36d34ac6bfb7d988541ffb29.jpg" align="right"><br><br><br>  We use high-speed, well-proven SSD-carriers (such as Intel 3500.3700), allowing to perform up to 75 thousand simultaneous read operations (and up to 11 thousand - write).  Combined in a RAID 10 on a high-performance Adaptec 8805 RAID controller, these drives offer a few hundred times faster access than hard drives.  The graphs show the total parameters of IOPS (Total IOPS). <br><br>  In the illustrations, you can see the performance comparison of a typical hard disk and SSD.  The Total IOPS values ‚Äã‚Äãare the total number of simultaneous read-write operations for random and sequential access. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/489/e1f/899/489e1f89980643e399a68d80399587d9.jpg" align="left"><br>  We do not limit users to access to the full performance of the disks - use all possible speed drives. <br><br>  REG.RU uses OpenVZ virtualization technology, which provides maximum performance.  You can choose several OS variants from the Linux family supported by this platform. <br><br>  Just as in the case of other VPS-products of our company, you can at any time go to a more productive plan, without interrupting your server. <br><br>  If you are already using our VPS product, you can request the transfer of an existing server to the SSD VPS platform - we will come to the rescue upon request. <br><br><br>  You can get acquainted with the tariff plans and order VPS hosting on SSD from REG.RU by following this <a href="https://hosting.reg.ru/vps/ssd%3Futm_source%3Dvpsssd3110%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dposthr">link</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242121/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242121/</a></p>
