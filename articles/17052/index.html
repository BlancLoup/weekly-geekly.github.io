  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ours at Stanford, the third day</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having worked (the locals call chatter in the negotiations and at lunch - work) on the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/nigma/31804.html">first</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/nigma/31856.html">second</a> day, on the third day we rested (see the pictures below), so let me dwell a little more on the general purpose of the visit and the current state of the developments. <br><br>  Since the main priority for us is the development of new algorithms, and all the latest search ideas came from Stanford, we have been communicating with the local (and for us at the moment - local) team of scientists for two years now.  So we can say that we decided to visit Stanford, because  We received an invitation from Hector Garcia-Molina to discuss the possibility of working together on a new search engine, but they do not refuse to meet with such people.  Hector's bluntness can be confirmed by the fact that when searching for books he has authored, the t-shirt <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref%3Dnb_ss_gw/102-4772114-4265703%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26field-keywords%3D%2522hector%2Bgarcia-molina%2522">‚ÄúI Love Hector Garcia-Molina‚Äù</a> is in second place ‚Äî if she‚Äôs standing there, then she‚Äôs really bought ‚Äî Hector is really a very smart and good person. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In parallel with communication with Hector, students of the Stanford Business School learned about our project, they have a class in which they learn to write business plans and give presentations of technological projects to venture capitalists.  Therefore, we also have another goal at the same time - to communicate with local venture capitalists, to understand how they think - we are engaged in seed financing for new start-ups in Russia (by the way, write, if you have ideas, we will give money ourselves and / or help on American capitalists).

      Regarding the details of the development of these very algorithms, I can honestly state that until recently they were not used at all on nigma.ru and I am not sure whether they will be used in the near future (although, perhaps, soon we will integrate their search into <a href="http://www.nigma.ru/index.php%3Ft%3Dmusic">music search</a> ).  It is about creating a fundamentally new search engine that is still in the development stage and which we are not yet ready to demonstrate to outside the scientific community so that there is no false start. <br><br>  Nevertheless, I want to note that already now it makes sense to use Nigma.ru, since <br><ol><li>  There are clusters (ok, though not always good, but often helping to reduce the search time) and other useful features. <br><br>  By using Nigma and clicking on Yandex.Direct advertising, you help us finance the development of new search technologies. <br><br>  OK, if you do not want to help us develop new search technologies, then you can simply use the search engine, <a href="http://www.nigma.ru/index_menu.php%3Faction%3Dauthorization%26display%3Ddisplay_action_rules">invite friends</a> and earn money.  And nigmarubli earned on the MLM-scheme - that is,  as much as your friends, your friends, etc. earn.  - You will earn the same amount. <br><br>  With earned money you can buy gifts for the New Year (and after the New Year - just useful things) for children from an orphanage or a special board (in the near future we will technically and officially announce this opportunity), or you will receive the gift you want by leaving it to yourself or by giving it yourself to someone you want to give it to. <br><br>  And now the promised pictures. <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="http://hotimg6.fotki.com/a/67_127/81_190/IMG_0976-th.jpg"></a> <br></td><td width="10"></td><td>  In the beginning, we decided to ride along the famous 101st highway, which connects all the major cities of Silicon Valley, in the direction of San Francisco. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="http://hotimg8.fotki.com/a/67_127/81_190/IMG_0983-th.jpg"></a> <br></td><td width="10"></td><td>  Along this highway are the head offices of almost all the largest IT companies in the world, with the exception of Microsoft and a couple of other companies. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="http://hotimg8.fotki.com/a/67_127/81_190/IMG_0990-th.jpg"></a> <br></td><td width="10"></td><td>  San Francisco was a city with low-rise buildings, more like a small coastal town than a metropolis. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="http://hotimg12.fotki.com/a/67_127/81_190/IMG_0993638-th.jpg"></a> <br></td><td width="10"></td><td>  The hills on which Hollywood often take spectacular chases, were much steeper than I imagined.  Indeed, a little pushing the gas, the car starts to "jump" on them.  However, it is not recommended to press on the gas, because  everywhere are radar and with fines here are very strict.  And the general driving culture is much more polite - no one overtakes on the right and does not fit into the front of the line, does not leave at a busy intersection, blocking the way to a stream along a perpendicular street, etc.  Because there are a lot of cars - there is practically no public transport at all, there are traffic jams, but the speed of movement is much higher than in Moscow. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="http://hotimg12.fotki.com/a/67_127/81_190/IMG_0998-th.jpg"></a> <br></td><td width="10"></td><td>  The Golden Gate Bridge was not golden, but rather rusty. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="http://hotimg8.fotki.com/a/67_127/81_190/PC010278-th.jpg"></a> <br></td><td width="10"></td><td>  But from far away, he looks very American - very impressive. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="http://hotimg16.fotki.com/a/67_127/81_190/IMG_1041-th.jpg"></a> <br></td><td width="10"></td><td>  After a short tour with the help of GPS, we returned to Palo Alto for a game between the Stanford and Berkeley teams, about which no one spoke of Big Game. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="http://hotimg16.fotki.com/a/67_127/81_190/PC020289-th.jpg"></a> <br></td><td width="10"></td><td>  All local people were skeptical about the chances of their own team (most often we heard ‚ÄúStanford is going to loose‚Äù), so when the Cardinals (the so-called Stanford university team) had their first touch-down and started to keep the score, I took a photo of the fact that Stanford still leads, expecting that later Cals (apparently from Universify of CAL California at Berkeley) will take revenge. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="http://hotimg12.fotki.com/a/67_127/81_190/IMG_1045-th.jpg"></a> <br></td><td width="10"></td><td>  But this did not happen - Stanford won with a score of 20-13, and we went and bought what could be the T-shirts and sweaters with the symbols of the team, in which you will see us in the reports for the next days. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="http://hotimg15.fotki.com/a/67_127/81_190/PC010273-th.jpg"></a> <br></td><td width="10"></td><td>  However, even if the Stanford staff is not always doing well with sports, with the business they are all super.
