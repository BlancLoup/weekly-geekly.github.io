In general, many large corporations usually remain silent until the problem is completely resolved, after which they try to whitewash themselves with a detailed story about what the problem arose and how it was solved.  But in the case of Sony somehow everything is confusing.  In general, many have heard that the PlayStation Network service did not work for several days (on Monday it was in ‚ÄúDown‚Äù).  Before that, Anonymous was going to conduct a large-scale attack on the Sony servers, in order to avenge GeoHot, to whom they made a global "offer that he could not refuse."  Apparently, the world is not so pleased with the hacker, who promised to boycott Sony products from now on (by the way, the shares of the corporation after this announcement fell somewhat in price).  Well, Anonymous did not take long to wait - an attack immediately followed. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  At first, everything seemed to be fine, and only minor interruptions in the operation of the PlayStation Network service were observed.  But then very significant problems followed, as a result of which the service was down for several days, and Sony either kept silent or vaguely spoke of ‚Äúsecurity problems‚Äù.  After some time, representatives of Sony announced the ‚Äúexternal invasion‚Äù, which caused the inoperability of the PlayStation Network and the music service Qriocity.

      On Monday, that is, yesterday, Sony posted a message stating that "we are waiting for more information about when PlayStation Network and Qriocity will be up and running."  However, how long to wait, and when the services will work - is not yet clear. <br><br>  Interestingly, <a href="http://anonnews.org/%3Fp%3Dpress%26a%3Ditem%26i%3D848">an earlier post</a> from the Anonymous group said that the group is not related to what happened, but does not deny the possibility that some members of this community were involved in the attack on Sony's servers.  In general, Anonymous disown this attack.  Moreover, in a message published on the same site Anonymous, it was reported that Sony is trying to divert attention from problems with its own servers, and to transfer responsibility to hackers. <br><br>  In general, there is no answer to the question ‚Äúwho is guilty and what to do‚Äù, however, experts say that if the attack was carried out with the aim of hacking servers and identity theft, then this could be dangerous for millions of users of Sony services, because the user‚Äôs profile is tied about credit card.  In this case, it is really beneficial to put the blame for what happened (and what is happening so far) on Anonymous, because in that case you can quickly find the "culprits", remaining white and fluffy. <br><br>  True, it is still premature to blame Sony, as there is no detailed information about what happened. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nf/20110425/tc_nf/78285%3B_ylt%3DAqEl2NnikLpucxdW6qzza2z6VbIF%3B_ylu%3DX3oDMTJiOWd1bHEwBGFzc2V0A25mLzIwMTEwNDI1Lzc4Mjg1BHBvcwMzBHNlYwN5bl9wYWdpbmF0ZV9zdW1tYXJ5X2xpc3QEc2xrA3BsYXlzdGF0aW9ubg--">yahoo</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118140/</a></p>
