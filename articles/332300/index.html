Combined with flexible tools to help developers safely distribute and monetize their software, Golem also changes the way they organize and execute computational tasks.  Thanks to the microservice architecture and asynchronous task execution, Golem should be the basis for future Internet service providers and software developers.  And due to the fact that the cost of computing is significantly reduced, complex programs (CGI rendering), scientific calculations and machine learning become more accessible for everyone. <br><br>  ‚óè <b>Golem</b> connects computers on a p2p network, allowing application owners and individual users (customers) to rent computer resources from other users (suppliers).  These resources can be used to perform tasks that require any amount of time and computing capacity.  Today, such resources are provided by centralized cloud service providers, but their shortcomings are closed networks, proprietary payment systems, and tight software code restrictions.  In addition, the main transaction system for Golem is Ethereum, which allows direct payments between customers, suppliers and software developers. <br><br>  ‚óè <b>Golem's function</b> as the basis of the decentralized computing resources market can be considered both IaaS (infrastructure as a service) and PaaS (platform as a service). However, Golem's true advantage is that it allows you to integrate specialized programs.  Any interested party can freely create and install programs on the Golem network by publishing them in the Application Registry.  Using the Structure of Transactions, developers can also expand and customize the payment mechanism, creating unique mechanisms for software monetization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/936/3c8/b97/9363c8b9715a4da38f461e1987ff6d09.png"><br><br><h2>  Golem Ecosystem </h2><br>  Golem's business task is to organize the market of computing resources in accordance with completely new principles thanks to relatively recent technological advances.  On the other hand, such major players as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM dominate the computing market today and do their best to ensure high profitability, which leads to high prices for computing services. Fortunately, this market situation will not last forever.  In the Golem network, the provision of computing resources is based on the contributions of individual and professional providers (providers), in combination with a set of specialized software solutions from the Golem Application Registry, which itself operates in a single and competitive market with almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_information">complete information</a> . <br><br>  <b>Scaling the computing market</b> with Golem requires combining three groups: suppliers of computing resources, task initiators (customers) who post their tasks on the Golem network and, of course, software developers.  These three groups constitute the unique, interdependent Golem ecosystem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f35/da5/8b0/f35da58b081e45dfb824496b6e0b1327.png"><br><br>  <i>Infrastructure resources</i> <br>  The computing power in the Golem network is provided by the suppliers.  The supplier can be either a regular user who can provide free time on his gaming PC, or a large data center that provides all of its computing power.  The interest of suppliers to join Golem is that they receive payments from customers for the tasks performed.  Of course, the Golem user interface will be easy to use and allow suppliers to easily set prices and decide what part of their free resources they are willing to rent. <br><br>  <i>Demand for computing resources</i> <br>  In order to pay remuneration to suppliers for the capacity provided, Golem must attract customers who are interested in these capacities.  The market that creates Golem will be very competitive due to the fact that this is a market with almost complete information and thanks to the ease of deploying programs on any equipment.  This will not only simplify the use of Golem, which will certainly attract customers - a highly competitive environment will also increase market efficiency, which will most likely lead to a much more objective and profitable price compared to existing cloud computing platforms. <br><br>  <b>One of the important features is</b> that the Golem market will allow customers to become suppliers: because most of them need additional resources only occasionally.  They will be able to rent their own equipment and receive additional income.  In addition, the financial aspect will not be the only incentive to use Golem: one of the key functions of the Golem will be the availability of various software running on its network and accessible from the Application Registry. <br><br>  <i>Programs &amp; Microservices</i> <br>  Although some primary use cases (such as CGI rendering) will be developed and implemented by the Golem team, of course, it is necessary to involve other developers in creating applications for the Golem.  The number and quality of such applications is one of the key factors for Golem‚Äôs future success.  For this reason, the Application Registry and the Transaction Structure are among the most important characteristics of the entire ecosystem and will occupy a central place in the development process.  Once implemented, they will provide developers with flexible and efficient tools for deploying, distributing, and monetizing Golem-based software.  It will be an ideal solution for microservices and some future decentralized applications (DApps), but it can also be an interesting way to distribute existing proprietary and free software. <br><br>  <b>Primary Usage: CGI Rendering</b> <br>  Alpha version of Golem: CGI-rendering using Blender <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7e8/bf0/41e/7e8bf041e2e14d6eb529b4ddc6b4009c.png"><br><br>  <b>CGI rendering</b> is the first and very significant example of the actual use of the <a href="https://github.com/fimapp/golem">Golem</a> . <br>  Instead of using expensive cloud services or waiting for their own powerful computer to appear, CGI artists can now visualize graphics quickly by renting computing resources from other users. <br><br>  Payment from the customer (in this case, the CGI artist) is sent directly to the suppliers who have provided their resources. <br><br>  In addition, when the computer of the contractor is idle, he can receive tasks from other users. <br><br>  <b>Plans for the future: Golem as part of Web 3.0</b> <br>  We believe that in the future, the Internet will become a truly decentralized network, allowing users to safely and directly share content without sharing it with corporations or other intermediaries.  Accordingly, Golem will be used not only for specific computing tasks, but also for the mass rental of computers that will perform operations in a self-organizing network.  Of course, this will require the parallel development of other technologies, many of which have received significant support in recent years. <br><br>  More efficient data exchange technologies are needed, but with the ongoing development of IPFS / Filecoin and Swarm, appropriate solutions seem to be within reach. <br><br>  Over time, the Ethereum network will become more scalable, more efficient and will include a full-featured network of micropayment channels.  As soon as these technologies become available, it is easy to present Golem primarily as a microservice platform, allowing users to run both small (for example, note-taking application) and large applications (for example, streaming service) in a completely decentralized way.  Despite the ambitiousness, the above is a powerful argument in favor of the large potential of the Golem. <br><br>  <b>Golem Network Token (GNT)</b> <br>  GNT is the main component of Golem and is designed to provide flexibility and control over the future of a project.  GNT is released with crowdfunding (described in this document), and after the first major release of Golem, the GNT token will have various functions. <br><br>  ‚óè Payments from customers to suppliers for the use of their resources and remuneration to software developers will be paid exclusively to GNT. <br>  ‚óè After launching the Application Registry and the Transaction Structure, GNT tokens will be required for other operations: provision of collateral by software vendors and developers, or testing and certification of programs (see the ‚ÄúApplication Registry‚Äù section). <br>  ‚óè GNT's general terms of use will be set in the Transaction Structure, but specific parameters can be set separately for each program to be installed. <br><br>  The number of GNT tokens will be limited to the pool of tokens created during crowdfunding. <br><br><blockquote>  Creating GNT tokens and primary functions of a GNT account <br><br>  ‚óè Golem network token is released on the Ethereum platform.  Its design conforms to widely used standards for the implementation of tokens.  This allows GNT to be used in existing solutions, such as the Ethereum Wallet. <br>  ‚óè The maximum number of tokens created during crowdfunding: <br>  ‚óã Total: 1,000,000,000 (100%) <br>  ‚óã Crowdfunding participants tokens: 820,000,000 (82%) <br>  Tokens Golem team 60,000,000 (6%) <br>  ‚óã Tokens of Golem Factory GmbH 120,000,000 (12%) <br>  ‚óè Sending 1 air to a GNT account will create 1,000 GNT <br>  ‚óè After crowdfunding is completed, there will be no creation of tokens, minting, or mining. <br>  ‚óè Tokens can be freely sent / received immediately after crowdfunding. <br><br>  More details in the ‚ÄúCrowdfunding‚Äù section. </blockquote><br><h2>  Registry of Applications </h2><br>  The Registry of Applications is a smart contract for Ethereum, where everyone can publish their own applications, ready to run on the Golem network.  Objectives of the Application Registry: <br><br>  ‚óè Provide developers with the ability to publish their applications and interact with users in a decentralized manner; <br>  ‚óè Provide a place for customers to search for specific tools that meet their needs; <br>  ‚óè For security reasons, give suppliers complete control over the program code they run. <br><br>  <b>Since the Golem network is completely decentralized</b> , we also want the Application Registry to be managed by the community itself. <br><br>  <b>Golem allows customers to run a program code</b> on a computer from a supplier. <br>  This code is executed in a sandbox and with a minimum priority. <br>  But software errors are found everywhere, after some time, attackers will be able to bypass the sandbox and run malicious code on the host machine, or even get control over it.  That is why we cannot rely solely on sandboxes. <br>  We could try to automatically determine the security of the code, but this is practically impossible (according to the Stop Problem). <br>  The code verification process cannot be fully automated and runs on an autonomous network. <br>  On the other hand, it is impossible to assume that no one will ever publish malware that will run over the Golem network. <br><br>  <b>To solve this problem</b> , we decided to divide the users of the Application Registry into three categories: authors, validators and suppliers.  Authors publish applications, validators check and certify them as safe by adding them to their own whitelist. <br>  Validators can also mark applications as malicious by adding them to the blacklist. <br>  Suppliers also have the right to decide which validator lists to use in each particular case of the launch of Golem on their equipment. <br><br>  In addition, suppliers can maintain their own whitelists or blacklists.  This gives each vendor greater flexibility in determining which software to run and how carefully it is monitored. <br><br>  Moreover, this system does not exclude any of the parties, and there is always room for the emergence of new validators. <br><br>  By default, Golem works using the white list of trusted applications. <br>  Since an empty whitelist for someone who only tries Golem for the first time may seem like a problem, we will add a number of proven applications to the whitelist of the original distribution. <br><br>  A supplier can use this mechanism by maintaining its own whitelist or use lists of validators that it trusts. <br><br>  On the other hand, a supplier owning a server farm may wish to use only blacklists. <br><br>  This option is designed for administrators of dedicated servers who want to maximize profits and be ahead of the rest. <br><br>  In this case, the blacklist is used in order to avoid any problem applications known at the moment. <br><br>  Again, a supplier can maintain its own blacklist or use validator blacklists that it trusts. <br><br><h2>  Transaction Structure </h2><br>  Creating something new and exciting, it is difficult or almost impossible to predict absolutely all the possibilities that open up with its appearance. <br><br>  Golem is a distributed global supercomputer, and so on.  He will undoubtedly be in demand in a variety of applications. <br><br>  These applications may require a wide variety of remuneration models.  We cannot develop a single payment system for Golem, and we will not try to force application developers to use it. <br><br>  When a developer integrates his application into Golem, he has the right to decide which transaction model to use, provided that it is compatible with the Transaction Structure. <br><br>  The Transaction structure will be a set of requirements;  Basic requirements may include: <br><br>  ‚óè entry in the Application Registry; <br>  ‚óè using an open source environment and / or a deterministic environment, such as EVM; <br>  ‚óè community approval or transaction model rating; <br>  ‚óè Use GNT to pay for software and service providers. <br><br>  We are building a Ethereum Based Transaction Structure.  Ethereum gives us a lot of power, which is very necessary in the implementation of advanced, confidence-free schemes. <br><br>  It includes components that are extremely difficult to implement in P2P networks, for example, reputation score. <br><br>  Sample Transaction Structure components: <br><br>  ‚óè Various payment schemes, for example: <a href="http://www.golemproject.net/doc/GolemNanopayments.pdf">nano payments</a> , <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/why-ethereum-b398df34df9b">mass payments</a> . <br>  ‚óè Off-chain payment channels <br>  ‚óè Customizable receipts <br>  ‚óè Payments to software developer <br>  ‚óè Launching the program on each individual host (host, hourly launch, etc.) <br><br>  In the future, this may turn into a template that will be customized by the community and used when implementing custom transaction models. <br><br>  To achieve specific non-payment goals, more complex components can be used in the transaction model.  For example: <br><br>  ‚óè Customer‚Äôs pledge account for tasks requiring a higher level of responsibility (high price due to the use of specialized equipment or long-term subtasks);  the customer can create a two-way security account and require suppliers to participate in it. <br>  ‚óè Supplier pledge: the customer may require control over a number of embedded GNT tokens. <br>  ‚óè Customer pledge: the supplier can only accept tasks from customers owning a certain amount of GNT. <br>  ‚óè Registration of a task as binding to a backup conflict resolution mechanism similar to TrueBit. <br><br><h2>  Road map </h2><br>  In this section, we present the main stages of Golem development. <br>  You can read non-technical details of the Golem architecture <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-architecture-bfd75faa8ecc">in our blog</a> , some thoughts about the upcoming calls are described <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/the-challenges-ahead-933f040cba95">here</a> , and of course, you can familiarize yourself with the program code on <a href="https://github.com/fimapp/golem">GitHub</a> . <br><br>  Successive versions of the Golem program are divided into stages.  This is a preliminary plan, since Golem uses advanced technology and is in itself a very complex project. <br><br>  Before each stage, research should be carried out and the results obtained, which are described in technical documents.  However, two important points need to be made: <br><br>  1. At each stage, add new features. <br>  2. The results of each stage depends on the amount of attracted financing. <br>  In the description of these stages, which is given below, these functions are assigned to four indicative financing scenarios. <br>  3. Functions marked with ‚Äú+ / ++ / +++‚Äù will be implemented if the appropriate level of funding is reached. <br><br>  We assigned code names to various versions of the Golem program, based on the golems of the game Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  The analogy is not perfect, but still it's e-golems. <br><br><h2>  Brass golem </h2><br>  ... they are created to achieve the same goal set during the creation, they wait in absolute patience until they are enlivened to fulfill this task. <br><br>  Brass Golem is the stage at which we are now and check our concept, conduct alpha testing. <br><br>  The current version of Golem is focused only on rendering in Blender and LuxRender, and although it will be useful for CGI artists, we believe that CGI rendering will be primarily proof of the correctness of our concept, as well as our training ground. <br><br>  Brass Golem will be used within 6 months after the end of crowdfunding and all tests. <br><br>  Despite the fact that we do not expect that CGI rendering in Blender will create enough turnover to justify all the forces that we have invested in the project, but this will already be the first decentralized market of computing power. <br><br>  <b>List of features offered:</b> <br><br>  ‚óè Basic Task Statement Scheme, which allows you to prepare the first task formulation; <br>  ‚óè Basic Application Registry - the first version of the application registry, based on Ethereum, which allows you to save tasks defined using the basic task definition scheme; <br>  ‚óè <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> integration for coordinating task data and content delivery, for example, delivering files needed to calculate a task, delivering results back to the customer; <br>  ‚óè Docker-environment with Golem-data for performing calculations in the sandbox <br>  ‚óè Local verification: a probabilistic verification system that calculates a fragment of the problem on the customer‚Äôs machine; <br>  ‚óè Basic UI and CLI; <br>  ‚óè Basic reputation system; <br>  ‚óè Implementing <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> and <a href="http://www.luxrender.net/en_GB/index">LuxRender</a> tasks. <br><br><h2>  Clay golem </h2><br>  There is a chance (...) that the evil spirit of chaos will take possession of the Clay Golem. <br>  If this happens, the golem‚Äôs control will be lost and he will attack the nearest living creature. <br><br>  Clay Golem has a big advantage over Brass Golem.  Clay Golem includes the Tasks API and the Applications Registry, which allow Golem to make a multi-purpose solution for distributed computing. <br><br>  Now developers have the means to integrate with Golem.  However, this innovation may affect the stability and security of the system, so this version should be considered experimental and focused on early users and enthusiasts.  Test your new ideas and solutions at this stage. <br><br>  <b>List of features offered:</b> <br><br>  ‚óè Basic Tasks API: an interface that allows the user to set simple tasks; <br>  ‚óè Initial Transaction Structure model with hard-coded payment schemes; <br>  ‚óè Redundant verification: verification scheme based on comparing the results of redundant calculations; <br>  ‚óè Basic delegation of subtasks: a mechanism for more accurate distribution of subtasks; <br>  ‚óè (+) Virtual machine support as a sandbox for computing; <br>  ‚óè (+) Developer documentation explaining how to implement your own tasks on the Golem network; <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚óè (++) Examples of the implementation of tasks: an example of the implementation of machine learning, the implementation of scientific problems, etc. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stone Golem</font></font></b> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The creators always retain control over the Stone Golems (...) unlike the Earthen. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stone Golem will bring more security and stability, but will also improve the functionality already implemented in Clay Golem.
