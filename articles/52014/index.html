      This small application is a personalized wiki format database.  Written in C # programming language, using the .NET 2 Framework, source code is not available, the author does not plan to share them.  The system is constantly evolving since December 2006, that is, for more than two years.  The intensity of updates can be judged by the blog - on average up to 10 new versions a month.  Of course, with the passage of time, the new versions have become less, this can be explained by the completeness, the reasonableness of the product.  He is almost perfect.  We must pay tribute to the author, who listens with great enthusiasm to the requests of users and, within his means, adds functionality (for which he is honored and respected!). <br><br><h4>  A few words about the application itself. </h4><br>  In parallel, there are 2 versions - for PC and for mobile devices.  They differ somewhat in appearance, but are fully compatible with each other (file synchronization using ActiveSync).  More information can be found on the website of the author.  I will describe the version for the PC, since I do not have devices on Windwos Mobile.  The program has the ability to run without installation (Portable), which is very convenient for use on USB media - everything is always with you.  It is intended, as well as the majority of Wiki, for maintaining the personal knowledge base, system of notes.  Unlike tree systems, it has a flat namespace inside one database (there may be several databases).  Each page is a file in the file system, the file extension is configured.  Here I must mention some features.  Since the program supports Unicode, each page with a Russian header generates a file in the file system with an unreadable view, like ‚Äú% D0% 9C% D0% BE% D0% B5.txt‚Äù is the coded word ‚ÄúMine‚Äù.  Everything is in order in the application itself, everything is displayed correctly.  English names in the file system are displayed correctly (readable).  On the w3bsit3-dns.com forum, there is a person who wrote a similar application (Wit Wiki), but with Russian support in the file system, plus the presence of a syntax converter for switching from the bLADE Wiki.  Since the project fell asleep, I still prefer the original version.  Perhaps if there are people who are ready to wake the author, the projector has a future.  I will be sincerely happy about it!  If there are those who wish to develop this topic, a person can easily be found at w3bsit3-dns.com. <br><br><h4>  About syntax. </h4><br>  As you <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">know</a> , Wiki does not have a single syntax, there is only a common concept - ‚Äúthe syntax should be simple, clear, safe, support quick viewing of the changes made, support external and internal links, headers, formatting‚Äù.  I use the bLADE Wiki for one month, I got used to the syntax for a week.  This is due to the fact that before that I did not write texts using wiki markup. <br><br><h4>  How I use the blade wiki. </h4><br>  For me, this application has served as a kind of incentive to use the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD">GTD</a> system.  Before that, I tried many times to start using any software for these purposes, but I could not find anything like it.  Maybe it sounds silly, but among the hundreds of existing applications (paid and free), I could not stop at anything.  There is no search in Russian, the application is very sophisticated and very heavy, the opposite is too primitive, the author abandoned his project, the application is paid, etc.  No, it‚Äôs not hard for me to pay for the software, just to understand for myself whether this software is suitable for me or not, I have to try it for quite a long time, and with the demo versions I‚Äôm automatically tightly bound to time.  At the moment I am in this application, the timing of his time according to the <a href="http://www.improvement.ru/zametki/dnevnik/">method of folding diaries of</a> Ilya Pravsky (improvement.ru).  It looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/129/37c/071/12937c07167db2fc19144b94e9efbd6e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Every day in the morning I create a new page and record all the events that are more or less significant for me there in a day.  I compiled a list of dates for the whole year using Excel.  For me, already an achievement that I have been recording everything for a month already :).  Of course, the matter is complicated by the fact that I am not able to use the mobile version, since my phone is the Nokia E71 (Symbian OS v9.2 s60 v3 fp1) ... But I found for myself a way out - synchronization with Outlook and copy &amp; paste.  Let the method is not automatic, but it works).  I also noticed that if you postpone recording something into the system today, then half of the cases will be forgotten.  This is also very well described in the method descriptions (see link above).  I motivate myself that if I do not support a prerequisite (write reports every day), then the efficiency of my development will be lower.  This system is the first step towards self-development, at least for me. <br><br><h4>  Advantages and disadvantages. </h4><br>  + ease of use, visibility <br>  + mobility <br>  + search <br>  + support for multiple databases <br>  + ability to export to HTML <br>  + customizable appearance <br>  + quick internal and external links <br>  + The ability to encrypt the database (but you need to be careful with this!) <br>  -kryakozyabry in the file system <br>  - lack of synchronization with Symbian or MS Outlook <br>  (-) lack of WYSIWYG editor.  But you can get used quickly <br><br>  PS <br>  This is my first post on Habr√©, do not judge strictly :). <br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52014/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52014/</a></p>
