In it I will talk about the fate of your hosting server, how it originated, what it breathes and what it has achieved.  At this stage, free hosting is provided for student and non-commercial projects.  Also, on the server raised media hosting and OpenID.  In the near future, the server will develop into a large project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Blah blah blah.  Can skip </h4><br>  I want to start by saying that I live in the city of Yakutsk.  The city is small, but is the capital of the diamond republic.  We look to the outside world through satellites and radio relay.  Everything goes through RosTeleCom.  In fact, this is such a window on the Internet with all the ensuing consequences.  There are no unlimited tariffs.  Oh, brazenly lying!  You can get 64 kbps for 3000 rubles per month. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/432/297/e54/432297e542de0580a4f0af2cd465a37b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Megabytes of "extrinsic" costs ordinary people up to 1.5 rubles, sometimes more expensive.  In connection with the above, the majority of users sit in the internal resources.  Fortunately, they are.  Everything is in the capital city of Yakutsk: IRC-chats, torrents, game servers, news and entertainment portals, thematic sites.  Here in this porridge and cook. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d39/141/4e8/d391414e8781ce103977c152f91a1224.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  The essence of the problem </h4><br>  Let's return to our sheep.  A couple of years ago I needed hosting for several of my sites.  At that time I was a student, money was made only for beer, and I was looking for exactly free hosting with PHP and MySQL.  In Yakutsk there was only one hoster that fit these parameters, but it had significant drawbacks.  Places stood out for a miser.  In fact, under the media files, there was nothing left.  The domain name of the 3rd level was not given, and the site could be accessed only by an ugly link pages.somehost.ru/sitename/.  You can still list the bad, but not the point.  Paid hosting cost from 500 rubles per month (and now it is not cheaper).

    <h4>  Solution to the problem </h4><br>  As a result, the idea to put your server on the basis of an old typewriter has matured.  The first site for the co-location for me was my own university.  The cooler buzzed, MySQL spun the database, Apache generated pages, and packages ran over the twisted pair.  Gradually, the sites of my friends and acquaintances ran to the server, new ideas and projects appeared.  The old Pentium began to misbehave, they expelled me from the university (my first dismissal, there were only two), and also left my job at the university.  There was a question about transferring the server to new equipment and to another site. <br><br><h4>  Second coming </h4><br>  As an acquaintance, I was allowed to stand by one of the providers (Alexey, Pavel, thanks). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9a/aa4/9e4/a9aaa49e44e3f7b1a01384191a1735e9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  An agreement on a gratuitous co-location was concluded.  The old building was found at the provider‚Äôs cabinets (it was necessary to finish it) in which the server settled.  I received stable access to the network on 100 megabytes, and the provider developed user resources.  Network shooters started spinning on the server, friends wrote network services, familiar webmasters kept websites.  I myself dabbled with the protection and settings, my hands were very itchy to twist-twist.  In spite of this, the server worked and overgrown with wonder services.  That video chat will appear, then Jabber, then birthday greetings.  Gradually, RAM and hard drives were added, the power supply changed, the server moved to a new building.  All this worked fine, but the disks were clogged up with old garbage, MySQL stumbled over errors, the motherboard junk.  And what did you want from an ordinary typewriter on a 478 socket, taken from I don't remember where it came from.  And in the yard in 2009. <br><br><h4>  Third coming </h4><br>  Gathering up with thoughts, experience, old recordings and driven by malfunctioning equipment, the concept of a new server was developed.  The server was positioned as a free hosting for non-commercial and student projects.  The provider receives more and more internal resources, students - the opportunity to show themselves and their knowledge, non-commercial projects - to place your website for free, and I have experience in such matters, a bit of fame and +1 in karma. <br>  At own funds (11 thousand wooden) new iron was purchased.  Currently the server configuration is as follows: <br>  Processor: AMD Athlon (tm) II X2 245 <br>  RAM: 4 Gb DDR3 <br>  HDD1: 1Tb under www and stuff <br>  HDD2: 500 Gb for backup <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a40/5bc/086/a405bc086aa4c91da2fa7595cac87569.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I chose the operating system from CentOS and Ubuntu.  I prefer Ubuntu due to the fact that in the city its mirrors are updated more often and I got used to it.  Server earned, packages ran again. <br>  What features are available to users: <br><ul><li>  Disk space up to 300 MB; </li><li>  FTP access; </li><li>  PHP, Perl, Python support; </li><li>  MySQL and PgSQL database support; </li><li>  Level 3 domain name (in the e-sakha.ru zone); </li><li>  Mailbox (if desired); </li><li>  Individual modules and settings (additional modules Apache, access to certain folders only from certain ip-addresses, etc.); </li></ul><br>  Little by little, I started transferring old services from backups and creating new ones.  Restored Jabber, created a media hosting site for the hosting itself and its IP (doing the configuration and maintenance of linux servers). <br>  Media hosting is raised based on OStube.  Quite an interesting German development.  You can display video, audio, documents, music and blog.  There is also a Web-TV made up of video.  I suffered on Russification (I can share). <br><br><h4>  What we have in the end. </h4><br>  Free hosting at the level of commercial analogues for non-commercial and student projects appeared in the city, which easily adapts to the needs of the client.  The service has already begun to be popular and received a number of awards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd7/60f/56c/bd760f56c873161a798a0b37d0da7b80.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d06/4da/42e/d064da42e7de42a8c370fdb0ad988e82.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If in your city there is a similar situation with the Internet, then do not expect a miracle, wonder yourself.  You can always find an old computer, put Linux on it, and the local provider will gladly put this miracle in my rack.  After all, it will not lose anything from him, and besides, it will be possible to have attractive resources for free.  Any questions or suggestions, write in a personal or leave a comment.  At the request of habrovchan can blind a detailed manual and put it here. <br>  For those who read to the end of the link to the project website <a href="http://www.e-sakha.ru/">Hosting Daisy</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94633/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94633/</a></p>
