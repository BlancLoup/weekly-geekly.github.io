  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How not to become an honest mailer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It has long been hosted on one resource that had the ‚Äúmailing lists‚Äù service.  For those who are not in the know - you load the list of addresses (lists are formed legally, no spam, Double Opt-in) and form a letter, the service automatically sends the letter to all addressees.  Actually, everything was fine, except for one - statistics.  I wanted to know how much was delivered, how much was read, etc.  etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Began to understand.  The ‚Äúbig three‚Äù (Mail.ru, Yandex and Google) have special services for analyzing such statistics.  And again, plugging, if Yandex and Google identify such mailings by SPF (for Google, heder should be added to the letter, for Yandex nothing is needed at all), Mail.ru has distinguished itself (and more than once, about him and the post itself) - only DKIM ! <br><br>  For everything to work, you need SPF, DKIM and DMARC (for completeness).  SPF and DMARC are implemented easily through DNS records, then not everyone has DKIM.  If the hoster is not a goon, and does not ask for an additional fee, like some well-known hosters. <br><br>  I went over and found a hosting provider that supports SPF, DKIM and DMARC and does not ask for additional money for it (by the way, it is cheaper than my current hosting provider, who did not provide such services). 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      So let's go.  Since he did not have ‚Äúmailing lists‚Äù, he had to ‚Äúcut‚Äù his own program. <br><br>  The first puncture.  If Yandex and Google do not impose restrictions on the incoming stream from one server, then Mail.ru, on the contrary, immediately bans, returning a 5xx error code.  There is a certain magic number, after which you begin to "chop", to achieve specific values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom technical support Mail.ru failed.  Google did not respond to the request at all, but Yandex responded that there were no such restrictions at all. <br><br>  Since I cannot create a grouping of servers within the framework of the standard tariff - I introduced a delay between sending Mail.ru domains (bk, list, etc.).  It went. <br><br>  Here is the second puncture.  In Mail.ru there is such a parameter as "Reputation" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2a/7b/91/2a7b91gmn-rf-ncgc6c0bum2nje.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The smaller it is, the better.  As written in the manual, the smaller it is, the less likely it is that your email will get spammed or rejected at all.  So this is not true - Mail.ru itself ignores this parameter.  Look at large reputation settings; all emails get into inboxes (January, February), and for smaller ones, some of them fall into spam (March). <br><br>  The third puncture is the ‚ÄúTrend‚Äù parameter.  This parameter should show the tendency of the ‚ÄúReputation‚Äù parameter to change, but it shows the wind in the apartment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qu/7k/o8/qu7ko8g4lt3cfh8w-txkzhkhfom.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Do not try to understand its logic.  This parameter grows and falls depending on the distance of thousands of comets from the Earth.  It shows an increase of 150%, but the next day the parameter is in the same place and vice versa.  To understand the "bursts" of the number of letters, these are the days when the mailing list was really there, the remaining days are the usual working correspondence (there are really so few letters, but only to the Mail.ru server). <br><br>  Fourth puncture.  Periodically in the column "Complaints" numbers other than zero began to appear.  As so, because all the recipients signed up on their own, why is getting into SPAM?  Here plus Mail.ru karma is FBL, which allows you to get the address of the user who pressed the "SPAM" button in the mail interface.  I began to write (from a different address) to such users ‚Äúwhy did you unsubscribe?‚Äù.  It turned out to be in the Mail.ru mail interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rm/we/xz/rmwexzpv6s1hd2x3dhssll_8aeo.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The user does not want to enter the letter and click the ‚ÄúUnsubscribe‚Äù link (the List-Unsubscribe header is present in the letter), he simply selects the letter in the list of letters and presses the ‚ÄúSPAM‚Äù button!  And correctly, according to the rules of Mail.ru, ‚ÄúThe subject of the letter like‚Äú Our daily mailing from the Firm ‚Äùor‚Äú Your monthly update `Product Name`‚Äù will help users immediately recognize your letter ‚Äù  That is, if the user ceases to be interested in the topic of mailing - he uniquely identifies you and sends to SPAM as it is no longer of interest! <br><br>  Fifth puncture.  If the user has not logged in to the mail interface for a long time and has received more than one mailing during this time, then this is a disaster  If the user is no longer interested in your mailing, then according to the previous ‚Äúpuncture‚Äù, the user selects several of your emails at once (he uniquely identifies you by subject or sender) and presses SPAM.  And in the column ‚ÄúComplaints‚Äù you do not receive a single number, but a number identical to the number of selected letters - and after all, there is only one user and one complaint. <br><br>  PS You will never be an honest mailer.  I managed to achieve a zero rating only once a year.  Although, as experience shows, rating influences anything - Mail.ru can, according to the principle of "Korean randomness," send your letters to spam. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348812/</a></p>
