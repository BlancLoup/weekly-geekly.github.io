  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The future of the Internet. Who makes history, and can we be among them?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  <b>I. Beginning</b> </h3><br>  2009-2010 marked the beginning of a big change.  The Internet confidently switches to Real time mode.  And this is clearly shown by all the major ‚Äúmarket players‚Äù - the processes in FriendFeed, Delicios, Wordpress, Digg, the situation with Twitter, the global changes in Facebook, the launch of Google's instant indexing and much more.  But this is only the beginning of the New Information Age of the Internet.  So what will happen next? <br>  Next will be the next, logical and logical step of evolution. <br>  Today, while many think what to do with the gigantic amount of information that more than 1.7 billion people create and read, while millions of people work and have fun on the Internet, the ‚Äúbig players‚Äù have written and approved their strategies five to ten years ahead.  And everything will be as planned, everything will be as they decided.  Why? <a name="habracut"></a><br>  What do you think we are different from the guys at the top of Google, Facebook, Twitter &amp; Co.?  Basically - nothing.  There are many professionals in their field.  Tens of thousands of people in the world are capable of the same as they, and even more.  But they have two main things that we don‚Äôt have: <br>  <b>1. Statistics.</b> <br>  <b>2. Understanding of Evolutionary processes</b> (event series, in which figuratively the values ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äúb‚Äù and ‚Äúc‚Äù indicate an unknown value ‚Äúd‚Äù). <br>  This knowledge opens up tremendous opportunities.  Much bigger than you might think at first glance. <br><br><h3>  <b>Ii.</b>  <b>Statistics</b> </h3><br>  The world is ruled by Statistics - the most powerful and reliable type of information.  Statistics is a set of sciences, volumes of research, analytics and years of work, expressed in a simple table.  Hundreds of sociologists, psychologists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, marketers, working in conjunction, spend years on what Facebook and Google gets for a month in the form of ready-made facts. <br>  What is the main value of statistics from a business point of view (any: both online and offline)? <br>  In the three most important things: <br>  <b>1. Reactions</b> (to action, product, situation, phenomenon, etc.) <br>  <b>2. Changes</b> (processes and changes in the properties of "elements" in the system) <br>  <b>3. Trends</b> (simplified - trends on the timeline) <br>  It is these data that can lead us to incredible results - <b>determining which ‚ÄúB‚Äù events will naturally follow ‚ÄúA‚Äù events.</b>  It is data on Reactions, Changes and Tendencies that point to regularities and periodicals of social processes that allow us to consider any vital sphere as a ‚ÄúFlow of events‚Äù, and not a static phenomenon. <br>  When they say to you: ‚ÄúForget about the past, it‚Äôs behind‚Äù, they are right, forget it.  But first ask him: ‚ÄúListen, buddy Past, well, and how are you going to influence the future?‚Äù. <br>  And if you ask well, it will give the answer. <br><br><h3>  <b>Iii.</b>  <b>Understanding Evolutionary Processes.</b> </h3><br>  Everything is very simple.  We live in a Causal world that is constantly moving and changing.  Each group of events has a group of events preceding them - causes or bases.  Any events are inevitably a consequence and at the same time a cause.  Everyone knows about it.  But, in itself, this knowledge gives nothing.  We would like to know what our actions now will lead to concrete results in the future.  But we can only guess, analyze something there, plan.  To know this for sure is impossible.  But is it? <br>  In fact, to know what will happen tomorrow, perhaps in the presence of Statistics. <br>  The main mistake of both start-up startups and many businessmen is that they operate in their system divorced from the event series, while the idea and actions should be a logical continuation of this series.  This means that it is reasonable to create when there are already bases for this. <br>  No need to try to create a need for people - it is an irrational waste of time and resources.  There is an erroneous view of idealists that people can and should be taught, shown, told, etc.  People are not up to it, they have enough of their concerns.  They themselves know what they want or think they know.  Why go against the tide? <br>  The ‚Äúbig guys‚Äù understood that in order for people to use a certain new product, it is not enough to simply give it to them: the <b>evolution in perception and thinking is a much more mass and natural phenomenon than the revolution.</b>  They know that it is more efficient to build using ready-made ‚Äúbricks‚Äù than to produce them ourselves.

    <h3>  <b>Iv.</b>  <b>Question.</b> </h3><br>  So who makes history?  Those who have statistics.  Those who understand what they are doing should be in a number of the Evolutionary process, should have a foundation of events, history.  Those who understand that nothing happens earlier and later than it should happen.  Everything has its time. <br>  <b>And the time for what will be tomorrow determines yesterday and today.</b> <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ <br><br>  P.S.  In fact, Statistics is closer than it might seem at first glance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89406/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89406/</a></p>
