And something I did not immediately like about it, something about it was wrong.  It would seem that an article is like an article; many of these are written by ours and the Western rich in order to ‚Äúfacilitate‚Äù access to investments ... but ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In short: Meta-communication ... diverges from the point of view.

      Maybe I don‚Äôt understand something, but it always seemed to me that venture capitalists WANT, it is easy to donate money to startups, and then get back their already multiplied funds.  The goal of these people is trivial, and is completely correlated with the goals of most people on the planet: to do nothing, and to have for it all the benefits of the world.  It is clear that they have money, and they somehow earned it.  It is clear that they are at risk ... <br><br>  Nevertheless, one should not forget who multiplies their capital.  Do not forget that we, start-ups, greatly help these people to rise even more.  And in general, since there is such a thing in nature as venture capital investments, it means they are beneficial to both parties.  Amen. <br><br>  Let's return to the article, it is about how we make life easier for businessmen.  (And why should we, in fact, make life easier for them? =) The target audience of the article is startups who want to receive paid funding.  That is, as conceived by the author, the article should help startups in terms of building a presentation ... But what do we see ... <br><br>  We see that Mr. Feld focuses on his transcendental coolness.  He tells us how he does not respond to mass mailings (it seemed to me that a real project should always have an investor in reserve, so why waste weeks searching for real names of clerks of all investment funds?);  how he does not respond to letters if, God forbid, made a mistake in his name;  how he can ‚Äúgo berserk‚Äù if a poor start-up (in the future he is very rich and now shaking with his knees) has finally found something to say to him at the end of the meeting. <br><br>  In the metasobs, Brad hints to us that he has already earned his money, and is ready to give up super-profits if the startup does not make all the curtsy to get an investment from him.  And since there is not enough money, Mr. Capital wants to continue investing with one hand.  He invents for us his own rules, such ritual dances with a tambourine, necessary for obtaining financing.  You still have not received anything from him, but you should already be walking, scratching your knees.  Imagine what will happen when he does give us money ?! <br><br>  In essence, this is just another managerial insanity, when a person, because of his coolness, falls out of the context of reality, forgets about what he really should do at work.  Let us recall the stories about Richard Branson, who barefoot went to the bank for a loan;  about the guys from Google, who promised options to the granny, who rented a garage (she refused).  And how Yahoo refused to buy the engine. <br><br>  In my opinion, lazy investors, narrowing their own rules the number of startups in question, and will sit with their millions, going to zero on deposits and government bonds.  So let the respected Brad, dressing his white shirt every morning, remember these success stories, and with a new force realize with whom and how he needs to work today. <br><br>  Or am I wrong?  ;-) <br><br>  PS: I could not post to startups, karma is not enough ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61311/</a></p>
