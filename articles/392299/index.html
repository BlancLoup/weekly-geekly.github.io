From classical to modern, from rap to rock, from pop scenes to highly intellectual music - there are a lot of options, worth trying.

      Donald named 10, in his opinion, the best songs that everyone should listen to: <br><br><ul><li>  Bob Dylan - Tangled Up In Blue (Blood On The Tracks) </li><li>  David Crosby - Laughing (Voyage Box Set) </li><li>  Grateful Dead - Ripple (Reckoning) </li><li>  It's A Beautiful Day - White Bird </li><li>  Jimi Hendrix - Who Knows (Live At Fillmore East) </li><li>  Jethro Tull - Think As A Brick </li><li>  John Abercrombie - Timeless </li><li>  Mahavishnu Orchestra - Trilogy (Between Nothingness and Eternity) </li><li>  The Fuel Will (The Good, The Bad, The Chubby) </li><li>  Miles Davis - It's About That Time - In A Silent Way </li></ul><br>  V. Biggs (musician and web designer) thinks that the best place to recommend is not the name of one song, but the whole album.  So you can better understand the mood that the music conveys, and immerse yourself in its atmosphere: <br><br><ul><li>  Radiohead - Idioteque (2000, IDM) </li><li>  Boards of Canada - Amo Bishop Roden (2000, downtempo) </li><li>  Aphex Twin - Xtal (1992, ambient techno) </li><li>  Joe Hisaishi - Reprise (2001, neoclassical) </li><li>  Tim Hecker - Trade Winds, White (Noise) Heat (2003, ambient) </li><li>  Boards of Canada - 5-9-78 (1996, IDM) </li><li>  Kendrick Lamar - Mortal Man (2015, hip hop / rap) </li><li>  The Beatles - Here Comes The Sun (1969, pop rock) </li><li>  Tim Hecker - Celestina (2004, ambient) </li><li>  The Beach Boys - God Only Knows (1966, baroque pop) </li></ul><br>  Joe Crofts (plays the piano and guitar, writes music) named his favorite songs and told a little about them: <br><br><ul><li>  Metallica - Master of Puppets - a song with an aggressive and quick start that completely conveys the meaning of the text to the middle turns into a beautiful and melodic solo. </li><li>  Megadeth - Holy Wars ... The Punishment Due - Joe's second favorite song.  Very fast, complex sound masterpiece, ending with an excellent solo of Martin Friedman. </li><li>  Black Sabbath - War Pigs - a song from the founders of heavy metal, the anti-war anthem for the past 40 years. </li><li>  Led Zeppelin - Stairway to Heaven - the song opens with Jimmy Page's incredible acoustic guitar playing and Robert Plant vocals.  Holds in the 10-ke of the best rock songs since 1972. </li><li>  Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody - perhaps one of the best Queen songs that will never go out of style. </li><li>  Guns N 'Roses - November Rain is Joe's favorite song from this band.  The mood of the song sets the game on the keys, as in other tracks from the album Use Your Illusion. </li><li>  Radiohead - Paranoid Android is a very strange and, thus, exciting track.  By structure, it is not similar to other songs, and the words are firmly stuck in my head. </li><li>  Jimi Hendix - Voodoo Child - classic rock.  Jimmy's outstanding guitar playing. </li><li>  Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here - a very beautiful song dedicated to Pink Floyd founder - Syd Barrett. </li><li>  Rage Against The Machine - Killing in the Name - the unique style of the group is clearly visible. </li></ul><br><hr><br>  Mark Erickson could not choose 10 songs from his huge collection of music, so he chose only a couple: <br><br>  <i>Dave Brubeck - Unsquare Dance</i> - a feature of this song is that it was written in 7/4 rhythm, and as it progresses, the tempo of the song gradually accelerates.  In the end, Joe Morello‚Äôs laughter can be heard - he was very pleased that the musicians managed to cope with the last difficult part of the song.  In 1964, the track took 74th place in the US Hot 100 chart and 14th place in the UK singles chart. <br><br>  <i>Orchestre Symphonique de Montr√©al - Maurice Ravel - Bolero</i> - if you listen to this song very carefully, you can see how the same melody sounds again and again.  The peculiarity of this song is in the drums.  The drummer plays one rhythm pattern throughout the composition (15 minutes). <br><br>  The piece begins very quietly (piano or pianissimo) and reaches the end of maximum volume (forte or fortissimo), while, as it progresses, the listener should not notice a rise in volume. <br><br><hr><br>  Based on the responses received, we have compiled a list of the most popular artists and their songs among Quora users, noted in <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-10-songs-everyone-should-hear">this</a> thread. <br><br>  The first line of popularity is shared by two epochal groups - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DA_MjCqQoLLA">The Beatles - Hey, Jude</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9Q7Vr3yQYWQ">Led Zeppelin - Stairway To Heaven</a> .  The second line, with a slight lag, is occupied by the legendary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DfJ9rUzIMcZQ">Queen</a> group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DfJ9rUzIMcZQ">- Bohemian Rhapsody</a> . <br><br>  Third place is occupied by the equally popular Pink Floyd band with the tracks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D217JOBWTolg">Wish You Were Here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_FrOQC-zEog">Comfortably Numb</a> .  Next come <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4F0ytNzHDj8">Bob Dylan - Like A Rolling Stone</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8SbUC-UaAxE">Guns N 'Roses - November Rain</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdvgZkm1xWPE">Coldplay - Viva La Vida</a> . <br><br>  Other works that were noted by the audience: <br><br><ul><li>  Metallica - Nothing Else Matters </li><li>  Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit </li><li>  Radiohead - Paranoid Android </li><li>  The Rolling Stones - Sympathy For The Devil </li><li>  Linkin Park - Numb </li><li>  U2 - One </li><li>  David Bowie - Heroes </li><li>  Simon &amp; Garfunkel - The Sound of Silence </li></ul><br>  Of course, you can list as many as you want, but here are a few of the most highly recommended performers: Bob Marley, Eminem, Imagine Dragons, Jimi Hendrix, The Beach Boys, Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Louis Armstrong, Michael Jackson, Porcupine Tree and Stevie Wonder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/800/ba4/663/800ba466358146428949cb8fa79b9cc8.jpg"><br>  Interiors of one of several <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4.html">showrooms of</a> Audiomania <br><br>  We decided to find out whether the opinions of Quora users coincide with the tastes of our employees and asked them what music they had recently listened to.  Of course, such "giants" as Metallica, Megadeth, Pink Floyd, U2 and Beatles, highly rated by Quora users, were included in our sample.  Noted in it and the popular Quora Coldplay, Linkin Park and Aphex Twin. <br><br>  But since our employees are immersed in the topic of music of various genres every day (of course, this is not their direct responsibility), our sample turned out to be much more diverse.  There were no rock veterans like Led Zeppelin and Queen in it (not because we don‚Äôt love them - just other artists like us lately), but they noted: <br><br><ul><li>  Domestic rap and rock bands, as well as Noize MC and the Leningrad group </li><li>  For some reason, not so popular on Quora, but no less famous are RHCP, Lenny Kravitz and A-Ha </li><li>  Pop performers from the 80s to the present: from Roxette to Jessie Ware and Dua Lipa </li><li>  And also representatives of the metal scene (obviously not popular with Quora visitors - compared to the classic rock).  Our favorites (from heavy and industrial to death, doom and groove metal): Iron Maiden, Rammstein, Amon Amarth, System of a Down, Five Finger Death Punch, Disturbed and Cemetery Of Scream. </li></ul><br>  PS <i>And which tracks, albums or bands do you think deserve special attention?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392299/</a></p>
