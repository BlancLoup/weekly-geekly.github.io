For a long time, teachers are paid not for the quality of education, but for its quantity and beautiful statistics.  But the secondary load that accompanies teachers inevitably is paid extremely low!  But more about that below.

    <h1>  Paid average or dark foam? </h1>  Paid secondary education is quite a real thing, which will not only help attract additional funding to schools, and partly relieve the budget from the burden, so the quality of education will inevitably increase.  Why?  Everything is very simple.  Why pay for a service that is not necessary or does not turn out to be of sufficient quality (that many parents consider that our education is no longer a cake). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let us skip the ‚ÄúEducational Riots‚Äù, in which parents with red stretch marks and white letters violently (foaming at the mouth) prove violation of their constitutional and other rights.  And also remember that today the state is able to arrange propaganda on TV. <br><br><h1>  Dry numbers </h1>  After talking with a familiar teacher, I came to the conclusion that the salary in the amount of <b>S = 35,000</b> rubles should be enough for a high-school spherical teacher in a vacuum.  Many teachers in this country, c / n at times lower.  The normal load for teachers may be <b>A = 24 hours per week</b> .  These are only lessons.  The remaining 16 hours before the full working week, the teachers work out in full checking the notebooks (now there is an extra charge of <i>~ 350r.</i> ) And participating in the life of each student (classroom guidance <i>~ 1000r.</i> ).  The remaining positions that require no less effort, do not exceed <i>500r.</i>  The cost of an hour of training from our spherical teacher will be <b>h = S / A * 4 = 364.58 rubles.</b>  In average students <b>Nu = 36 hours per week</b> .  In the class, on average, <b>C = 25 students</b> .  What a month turns into <b>M = (Nu * h / C) * 4 = 2100 rubles per student</b> (more precisely, his parents) for the work of a teacher. <br>  Now it remains to calculate the rest of the process that accompanies the training.  It: <ol><li>  Technical staff </li><li>  School administration. </li><li>  The cost of maintaining the school as an engineering object. </li><li>  Utility costs. </li></ol>  Point 3 and 4 in my opinion, the state should take on their shoulders.  How does it state.  And in no case do not transfer these objects to private hands!  Never! <br>  But paragraphs 1 and 2, the state should share with their parents.  In what proportions the question is open, and how much the services of managers will cost I cannot read.  But if we put aside corruption and other negative, then it can be understood that in practice almost the entire administration is also a faculty, and it is already well paid for it.  Already I see the slogan in the school principal's office - ‚ÄúDo you want and know how to manage?  Do it for free! ‚Äù  But seriously, you can reduce the training load for the administration by 2 times (roughly speaking) while maintaining the s / n.  Then the wolves are fed and the sheep are intact, as now the head teacher or director can not take the load for more than 12 hours. <br><br><h1>  With the philosophy is clear.  But what in practice? </h1>  I think a reasonable price for a month of training my child, depending on the region of residence, may be <b>from 4,000 to 10,000 rubles per month</b> .  Accordingly, the teacher‚Äôs salary cannot be the same everywhere (let's face it, any salary cannot be the same everywhere).  Thus, when the salary to the teacher in 2100r.  with a student (more precisely with his parents) for the work of the teacher will save the fathers of our democracy!  This figure can be regulated by categories, experience and other achievements of the teacher, including scientific activities.  About the poor (those who do not pull 4000r. / Month.) Segments of the population, I am not talking, because  This is again a public concern.  These layers both were before, and will remain after. <br><br><h1>  findings </h1>  As a result of such a reform, on the part of the state, we will see teachers with high salary, on ‚Äúself-sufficiency‚Äù, reducing the costs of technical staff and school administration, by shifting half of this burden to parents.  Especially in this country they like to shift everything to someone else, preferably to the public. About the fact that the article does not take into account taxes and other state authorities, I can only say one thing - to take taxes from teachers of compulsory secondary education (as well as doctors, policemen, firefighters and some other workers "MU") is a blasphemy.  For many spheres of activity, it would be time to introduce tax benefits.  But this is a question of another article. <br><br>  I hope to talk about the moral side of the issue in the comments.  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92527/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92527/</a></p>
