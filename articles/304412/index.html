  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Data Center Cooling: Experience Bluon Energy, Emerson, Star Refrigeration, Asetek and CoolIT Systems</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The technological process is rapidly developing, new technologies are being created and developments are being improved.  However, for most operators and data center owners, the problem of choosing the most suitable cooling system for data centers is still relevant.  Too much electricity is consumed to optimize the temperature regime of the servers (up to 40-50 percent of the total power consumption of the data center).  At the same time, there is a lot of money to increase the efficiency of server farm cooling systems.  And therefore, companies are constantly struggling to solve this problem.  Cooling systems and strategies are also improving each time.  This happens both thanks to wealthy owners of data centers, such as Microsoft Corporation (the company's engineers are considering placing an autonomous data center at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean), and thanks to individual vendors who spend part of their profits on research and development of the industry.  With common efforts, the data center cooling systems market is moving forward. <br><br>  Below are recommendations and news regarding the cooling of data centers from companies: Bluon Energy, Emerson, Star Refrigeration, Asetek and CoolIT Systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/719/660/afa/719660afab46422d933ea1fb6a4c1099.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Bluon Energy product - a new zeotropic blend of ASHRAE refrigerants </h4><br>  Specialists from the company for the production of refrigerants <a href="http://www.bluonenergy.com/about-us/">Bluon Energy have</a> developed a zeotropic multi-phase blend of refrigerants TdX 20 (ASHRAE catalog name - R-458A).  This product is certified by the American Association of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers; ASHRAE).  The mixture is designed to replace the freon R-22.  Over its creation for six years, many of the company's employees worked.  And also some regular customers, Bluon Energy vendors, took part in the development. <br><br>  The mixture is pre-assigned to safety class A1, but the final approval and assignment of the ASHRAE classification is expected by mid-summer 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d11/b43/1aa/d11b431aa6a24477bc776e67132d7da8.png"><br><br>  Bluon Energy product is designed to replace R-22 without making any changes or modifications to the heating equipment.  All that is needed is only to carry out a minor adjustment of the equipment. <br><br>  TdX 20 can increase the efficiency of existing refrigeration systems by reducing the load on the compressor.  It reduces power consumption by up to 25 percent.  In addition, it is a low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerant, thereby significantly reducing carbon dioxide emissions. <br><br><h4>  Emerson: The Benefits of CO2 Based Cooling Solutions </h4><br>  The American company <a href="http://www.emersonclimate.com/en-US/pages/default.aspx">Emerson Climate Technologies</a> is developing new technological solutions in the field of energy networks, process management, industrial automation, climate technology, and instrument making.  The company's specialists are going to launch a web-based tool to inform data center operators and other interested parties about the benefits of CO2-based refrigerants and related climate equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b70/934/a96/b70934a96d62451c8920fc4874d5a09d.jpg"><br><br>  The new tool should simplify the life of potential and current customers of the vendor.  It will allow you to easily access information related to CO2-based products from Emerson. <br><br>  The system will be based on a user-selected geographical region and product category, displaying a list of relevant products, components and accessories.  She will also provide important background information. <br><br><h4>  Chiller EcoDesign from Star Refrigeration </h4><br>  The British company <a href="http://www.star-ref.co.uk/our-products/azanechiller.aspx">Star Refrigeration has</a> demonstrated the ammonia chiller Azanechiller 2.0, compatible with EcoDesign standard.  According to the company's engineers, development efficiency is 71 percent higher than the value prescribed in the EU Minimum Energy Efficiency Standard Directive (MEPS). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/938/582/025/938582025c9d46dca50c8669c9bb7a09.jpg"><br><br>  Calculations carried out by experts show that using Azanechiller 2.0 will reduce operating costs by ¬£ 13,000 compared to other ammonia chillers.  In addition, it will be possible to achieve a carbon footprint reduction of 1204 tons of CO2 over a period of 20 years.  If we compare the novelty with chillers based on R22, then the annual savings in operating costs will be in the region of ¬£ 30,000. <br><br>  Currently, EcoDesign is becoming increasingly popular around the world.  This concept is aimed at reducing energy consumption, it takes into account all the environmental impacts of the product from the very early design stage to its creation, including the elimination of the use of toxic substances during its operation.  In EcoDesign plays a role: the origin of the materials;  safety in use (so as not to harm health, noise was minimized, there were no emissions, radiation, vibrations, etc.);  simplicity and safety disposal. <br><br><h4>  New liquid cooling system on ISC16 from Asetek </h4><br>  Danish manufacturer of liquid cooling systems for data centers <a href="http://www.asetek.com/">Asetek</a> presented a new product at the International Conference on Supercomputers (ISC16) in Frankfurt, Germany. <br><br>  At the heart of the development is the LSS platform RackCDU D2C.  This liquid cooling system is designed to optimize the temperature mode of the graphics accelerator <a href="http://www.asetek.com/press-room/news/2016/asetek-liquid-cools-nvidia-tesla-p100-gpu/">NVIDIA Tesla GPU P100 (Pascal)</a> .  It was created as an add-on for the NVIDIA Tesla Accelerated Computing Platform and is used to create high-power supercomputers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86d/df0/d38/86ddf0d385554e588d4dd107092fa6d7.jpg"><br><br>  With the help of the new Asetek liquid cooling system for the Tesla P100, the creators of supercomputers and data center operators can increase the density of components inside servers and compute nodes while significantly reducing cooling costs. <br><br><h4>  Rack DCLC CHx80 to ISC16 heat transfer module from CoolIT Systems </h4><br>  At the International Conference on Supercomputers in Frankfurt, the Canadian company <a href="http://www.coolitsystems.com/">CoolIT Systems was</a> also noted.  She specializes in the design and manufacture of energy-efficient liquid cooling systems for servers.  Representatives of CoolIT Systems showed the conference participants a new heat exchange module Rack DCLC CHx80 Heat Exchange Module.  This solution maintains racks with heat load from the IT equipment at the level up to 80 kW and occupies at the same time the intra-rack space with a height of only 4U. <br><br>  The design of the device is made in such a way that allows the recovery of thermal energy to heat the surrounding buildings or the organization of hot water.  The heat exchanger provides increased cooling capacity while achieving reliability at the level of N + 1. According to company representatives, it can be used to service up to 120 microservers simultaneously.  And what is important, warm water can be used as a working medium (temperature up to +45 ¬∞ ).  This increases energy efficiency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/622/97a/21c/62297a21ce3241a8888e22d2fa9956ca.png"><br><br>  You can control the CHx80 locally using the built-in 4.3-inch LCD screen, or via a remote terminal with support for common network protocols. <br><br>  CoolIT Systems also demonstrated active (EP2) and passive (RP2) cooled plates designed specifically for the next generation of co-processors Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing.  In addition, server-based LSS was shown compatible with products from several major manufacturers, including Dell (Dell PowerEdge C6320), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (Apollo r2000 supercomputer), Huawei, Lenovo, NEC (Blue Marlin) and Supermicro (Intel Ninja Developer Platform from Supermicro) . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304412/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304412/</a></p>
