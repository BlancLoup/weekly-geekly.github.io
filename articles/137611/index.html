And we invite you to join. <br><br>  If you look at Open-Source in the West, then behind the slender columns of technology that we all know and love will look through the heads of commercial companies.  Creating something, you make life easier not only for colleagues, but also for us.  We save time (and therefore money) and create the beautiful with the use of your work.  We are obliged to respect this and help all that we can.  We join our western colleagues and offer grants for open source projects. <br><br>  Since March 2012, we are opening two programs: <br><ol><li>  The program of sponsorship of OSS-projects </li><li>  Project ‚ÄúHunting for Open-Source‚Äù </li></ol>  The program of sponsoring existing projects will be announced separately, and today we want to invite you to participate in our hunt. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Very often in the work we lack the convenient implementation of one or the other.  If we have the opportunity to correct the situation, we correct it and distribute the result to the community.  But what if there are no resources at hand at the moment?  Then we suggest you do it!

    <h2>  How it works? </h2><br><ol><li>  We openly publish our needs ‚Äî be it final products or software components. </li><li>  If you have a desire to do something for people, or you see your need in our list - you contact us. </li><li>  We sponsor the work on this project by publishing its code under open licensing (BSD / MIT) of your choice.  Authorship, of course, is yours.  Our only general requirement is to host a project on Github within our organization. </li><li>  Our representative takes part in the development as an assistant and a person who can more accurately articulate our needs.  Of course, our needs are not limited to you.  But their implementation is part of this program :).  For real Jedi, this means an extra head, and for those who have just taken the path of power, an experienced mentor who will help to do everything right. </li><li>  Together we bring the project to the first release and beyond, depending on the circumstances: <ul><li>  we leave the project to the community support </li><li>  We continue to sponsor the further development of the project, transferring it to the OSS support program </li><li>  we take for independent support if the author is no longer interested in the project </li></ul></li></ol><br><h2>  What can you do right now? </h2><br>  Right now we have two needs related to the development of RICH applications on JS.  In our opinion, the transition of most of the development to the browser is not far off, it is time to actively prepare. <br><br><h3>  Parser inline documentation for CoffeeScript (a-la JavaDoc) </h3><br>  CoffeeScript quickly grew from a Jeremy toy into a full-fledged language.  And no matter how hard he tries to remain JavaScript as much as possible, there are significant differences in it.  These differences impose restrictions on the use of tools for JS with him.  Some time ago, CoffeeLint appeared, followed by CoffeeDoc.  Unfortunately, the latter followed the docco path and Coffee never had a strict analogue of JSDoc and YARD. <br><br>  Since Coffee settled in Rails, he settled in our hearts.  Moreover, our practice has shown that the amount produced by Coffee begins to overtake all other languages.  With such a quantity of it, a strict standard of inline documentation is a must. <br><br><h3>  Help in documenting our open JS framework </h3><br>  Of course, we tried Backbone, Spine, ExtJS, Sproutcore (+ Ember.JS).  Unfortunately, they all give the application to the power of the developer, defining only five modular entities.  And if, at first glance, freedom is great, in practice the approach of Conventions over Configurations has proven its effectiveness in the same Rails. <br><br>  His name is Joosy and he lives with us for three months.  During this time, we managed to build on its basis two large projects that are preparing for launch and continue to use them for all new ones.  Joosy allows the most transparent transfer of most Rails-development (and therefore execution) to the browser. <br><br>  The framework is growing at an incredible speed, but with a transitional age came problems.  Even we don‚Äôt have enough tests and human memory, and not only the dry API internal documentation, but also a full-fledged guide with examples will be needed for the release. <br><br>  We want to invite to participate in its development a person who is ready with our constant help to thoroughly understand the project and coordinate the development of its documentation. <br><br><h2>  Where should i write? </h2><br>  You can contact us using the address <a href="">hello@roundlake.ru</a> or through the personal mail of the users <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/inossidabile/" class="user_link">inossidabile</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/xternal/" class="user_link">Xternal</a> . <br><br>  The issues of interaction are discussed individually and are aimed at ensuring that it is not only effective, but also comfortable for both parties. <br><br>  And, of course, we will be happy to discuss the ‚ÄúHunt‚Äù in the comments below. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137611/</a></p>
