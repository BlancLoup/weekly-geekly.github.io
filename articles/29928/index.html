My first post on Habr, please do not kick much. <br><br>  Six months ago, Windows XP took me out and I began to look for a replacement for it.  I was advised to switch to Vista; Linux was scared that the last Photoshop was not running under it (at least at that moment), so I looked in the direction of Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.1. <br><br>  There was no money to buy a new Mac, and somehow it was scary right into the pool with my head, so I learned about the possibility of unofficially ‚Äútesting‚Äù the Apple OS by installing a patched version of Mac OS on an Intel PC.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will say straight away, I understand that this action is illegal, is being pursued, etc., but I justified myself that if I was satisfied with everything, I would buy a full-fledged Macintosh and my conscience would be clear. <br><br>  I will not provide links to resources where you can download Hackintosh, if you need to - search for the word kaliway. <br><br>  The assembly is installed on computers of the following configuration: Intel dual core is required, the motherboard is better on the Intel chipset, the graphics card is NVidia.  When installing, you need to dance with a tambourine, I was put on the 4th attempt. <br><br>  Well, you probably know all this, so let's get to the point. <br><br>  <strong>Impressions of work</strong> <br><br>  <em>Pros:</em> <br><br>  - Mac OS is really fast.  If you describe it in a simple way - you run several programs at the same time and there are practically no gaps. <br><br>  - Subjectively, it seemed that the Internet is faster.  With simultaneous work of the torrent client and surfing, the loading of the pages becomes of course slower, but the pages still continue to load.  Although in Windows it is in XP, that in Vista, if the torrent client or download manager is working, which doesn‚Äôt have a manual speed limit, it‚Äôs almost impossible to surf. <br><br>  - Photoshop and all Adobov applications work just <em>mega</em> fast.  Loved it. <br><br>  - I liked the work with memory - you do not worry about any swap files, the system does everything itself.  There have never been any reports of a lack of memory. <br><br>  - All documents and all program data are stored in one place - it is convenient to search and transfer an account. <br><br>  - I liked the built-in search - quickly and efficiently.  So well built-in calendar and email client. <br><br>  - When installing drivers or programs, a reboot is not required, since  no registry.  Each program file is a ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù with data and files.  Very convenient, you do not need to install anything - just drag the file into the folder and that's it.  Uninstallation - on the same principle. <br><br>  <em>Neutral</em> <br><br>  - The interface causes twofold feelings - on the one hand everything is simple, all programs can be quickly set up, on the other hand, sometimes programs are too simple - you want to enable some function (for example, you did not find in one video player where you can choose an audio track when playing mpeg4-files, maybe this could VLC, but it stopped running at me, although more on this below), but it is not. <br><br>  - ‚ÄúTime Machine‚Äù - yes, it is beautiful and simple, but I didn‚Äôt need it in six months, never, I still think that copying data every hour is redundant.  This car took me 350 GB of hard drive completely (enough for about a month of kickbacks ago). <br><br>  - Periodically stopped to run or hung up some very necessary programs.  It was not possible to track down the cause and even to create causal relationships.  Of course, I sin on the <em>hack of</em> intosh, I think this is not observed on the original Mac. <br><br>  - ‚Äú1C‚Äù, the bank client and the financial accounting tool launched at WMWare, did not bother much, but still. <br><br>  - I did not understand the logic that directories are sorted along with files in the integrated explorer.  I'm already used to the fact that in Win directories always go to the top - in my opinion it is more convenient.  Perhaps somewhere you can customize, did not find. <br><br>  <em>Minuses</em> <br><br>  - Did not find a normal ftp-client.  I didn't like everything I put. <br><br>  - Very lacked Total Comander-a.  All the same, sometimes you had to work with files at a lower level than the built-in explorer allows.  I did not find any substitutes (I didn‚Äôt like everything I put). <br><br>  - Normal ICQ - no.  Adium (the only client I liked) does not provide even half the functionality of qip. <br><br>  - Office package.  This is a headache.  The Microsoft Office for Mac OS is a buggy drag-on hack, the rest of the office suites even formally support Microsoft formats, in fact, when opening in Windows's Office's, there are sometimes very big differences. <br><br>  Epilogue. <br><br>  Problems with the failure of some programs forced all the same to put Vista, since by the time SP1 came out.  I was pleasantly surprised that many of the interface chips are ‚Äúunderused‚Äù from the Mac OS. <br><br>  If you now ask me if I will buy a Mac, then most likely not, some disadvantages turned out to be too weighty (rather, even minuses of the specifics of my work with a computer, than the OS itself), but on the whole the system left a very pleasant impression. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29928/</a></p>
