But, unfortunately, there was not enough time for this, which leaves us with a moral obligation and, naturally, the desire to organize such a round table separately. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24a/f25/fd5/24af25fd5db6f9c8a53edda8970076f4.jpg" alt="image"></div>

      Actually there was already a video of speeches of speakers of the section, but according to the incomprehensible logic of the broadcast organizer, only the figures speaking without taking the slides and presentations themselves were shot (although this is probably done to avoid copyright trolls, I don‚Äôt see any other logic).  Therefore, below I post not only the video, but also the presentations of the speakers themselves, I hope you will be able to synchronize the video image and slide browsing.  Well, of course, to whom it will be interesting. <br><br>  The video is not embedded here - so I give a <b><a href="http://rutube.ru/video/embed/6960006%3Fp%3DyC9Fn5mFBc1Z8-pMw9YnJA">link to it on RuTube</a></b> . <br><br>  <b>Speakers, in order of performance:</b> <br>  Artem Kozlyuk, your humble servant, <a href="http://rublacklist.net/">"RoskomSvoboda"</a> <br>  Arseny Bobrovsky and Ekaterina Romanovskaya, <a href="http://www.kermlinrussia.com/">KermlinRussia</a> <br>  Ivan Zasursky, Moscow State University, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25C7%25E0%25F1%25F3%25F0%25F1%25EA%25E8%25E9,_%25C8%25E2%25E0%25ED_%25C8%25E2%25E0%25ED%25EE%25E2%25E8%25F7">media person</a> <br>  Sarkis Darbinyan, lawyer and human rights activist, <a href="http://pirate-party.ru/">‚ÄúPirate Party of Russia‚Äù</a> <br>  Vladimir Kharitonov, <a href="http://www.webpublishers.ru/">"Association of Internet Publishers"</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Naturally, the organizer and presenter of the section strongly called on her and representatives of government bodies and other supporters and adherents of tightening the state regulation of the Internet sphere, but none of them decided to openly look at the Internet audience in the eyes, express their point of view and respond to the accumulated Runet to them questions.  What we have. <br><br>  The presentations themselves: <br><br><h1>  <b>1. "Legislative rink on Runet"</b> </h1><br>  Announcement: <br>  Currently, about 20 bills have been submitted to the State Duma, which are repressive for the Internet and IT industries: they introduce new criteria for prohibited information, blocking, burdening businesses on the Internet, restrictions, bans, fines and leveling the rights of Internet users. <br>  Looking back, when the first law on extrajudicial blocking was introduced in 2012, we can recall that this was done to protect children, to protect them from drugs, pedophilia and suicide.  What happened in the end?  Children did not begin to live happier and safer, but it has become the norm to regularly introduce new laws on blocking information on the network, which have already begun to hurt all subjects of mutual relations on the Web.  Runet doomed?  If Runet himself admits this, then yes. <br>  But what kind of reciprocal steps can society and IT business take as the priority subjects covered by the laws regulating the Internet sphere? <br><br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/33933204&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg4No7YvyHkP6WL6OP93r2l0gWY7w" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br>  ( <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/temychk/ss-33933204">link</a> ) <br><br>  The full transcript of my report, so as not to occupy a place <b><a href="http://rublacklist.net/7654/">here</a></b> , <b><a href="http://rublacklist.net/7654/">can be viewed here</a></b> , and at the end of this post I will give only sketches of options for action by the public and Internet business in this situation.  And I urge you to think together about these and other options for joint participation that you have proposed. <br><br><h1>  <b>2. ‚ÄúCopyright reform in the digital age‚Äù</b> </h1><br>  Announcement: <br>  Today's concept, chosen to protect copyright on the Internet, seems to many participants to be ineffective and rather controversial.  Today it is obvious that the existing laws in the field of copyright are not adequate to the development of technologies and communication systems, and even hinder further technological development, and the 50-70-year period of copyright protection in the 21st century is a monstrous archaism.  In support of the current situation are the largest media corporations, record companies, producers and publishers, intermediaries. <br>  We propose a new approach for the legal regulation of the civil circulation of content in the network.  We believe that the <a href="http://changecopyright.ru/">time is</a> ripe <a href="http://changecopyright.ru/">to change copyright</a> and propose a <a href="http://roskomzakon.ru/category/bills/concept/public-domain">new concept</a> so that the rights of users, information brokers and copyright holders are more balanced. <br><br>  Video intro from the performance: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qcws96JrICU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiRWOOEfy7hc8b_Gh618hoSrhlOQA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/33969075&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgh6giNJVhpkgG_ks_rFTKTFNUKSQ" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br>  ( <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sarkisdarbinyan1/ss-33969075">link</a> ) <br><br><h1>  <b>3. ‚ÄúPlan B, or Perspectives of the smuggling traffic market‚Äù</b> </h1><br>  Announcement: <br>  Black lists, registration of sites, white lists, "Great Russian curtain".  The end?  Not.  There are still too few Chinese living in Russia, and therefore those who are watching for traffic will want to watch both adult films and Western TV shows, and be aware of what words the curtain guards curse.  Yes, and ill-mannered hackers, including those not educated in the spirit of Confucius, are also missing.  So there will be loopholes, backdoors, VPN traffic smuggling, satellite modems, illegal cross-border WiFi, mesh networks.  And a 10-fold increase in the cost of such traffic, which IT-bootleggers simply cannot ignore.  How exactly will this all be?  I am pleased to give the report to more competent hands. <br><br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/33914859&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjIkuAkzKtXC1y-vYWQ9hE-rucCzw" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br>  ( <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/VladimirHaritonov/ss-33914859">link</a> ) <br>  Immediately I give an answer to the question that is often asked of many who have watched this presentation is very tormented: slide number 11 is a frame from the cartoon <a href="http://www.world-art.ru/animation/animation.php%3Fid%3D5909">‚ÄúWork for Voice‚Äù</a> . <br><br><h1>  <b>So what to do?</b> </h1><br><h2>  The asymmetric response of society </h2><br>  - Examine tools to restore access to information ( <a href="http://rublacklist.net/bypass/">we tell you about them</a> ); <br>  - Be able to use encryption methods and specialized software; <br>  - When blocking an online resource - sue (we will help you legally); <br>  - To arrange social DDoS of responsible government agencies (the <a href="http://rublacklist.net/7547/">campaign ‚ÄúTo the block - NO!‚Äù</a> ); <br>  - Sign the petitions and appeals (yes, the result is opaque, but the water wears away the stone); <br>  - You know yourself - tell your friends (public "SMM"); <br>  - Participate in public discussions of bills (we created for this platform <a href="http://roskomzakon.ru/">"RosKomZakon"</a> ); <br>  - Join online and offline strikes and promotions ( <a href="http://rublacklist.net/5993/">we participate in their organization</a> ); <br>  - To know who initiated, and <a href="http://rublacklist.net/00/%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5/">how deputies voted</a> on the laws against the Internet, to draw conclusions for the future. <br><br><h2>  Asymmetric IT business response </h2><br>  - Do not stay away!  The policy has come to the full and to you and it is already impossible to remain indifferent to the situation; <br>  - Conduct an educational program for your customers and users (for example, how telecom operators act, who, on their access restriction stubs, give a link to blocking bypass tools); <br>  - Take part in helping public organizations and initiative groups (if they themselves support their ideas, but are not ready to act themselves); <br>  - Form a lobby group or help them develop; <br>  - sue and challenge the decisions of government agencies (we are ready to help you legally with this); <br>  - Organize industry online and offline strikes; <br>  - Set up campaigns and collect user signatures (for example, Google‚Äôs <a href="https://www.google.com/takeaction/">‚ÄúAdd Your Voice To Keep The Internet‚Äù</a> campaign); <br>  - Use the power of your online resources to disseminate information about civil initiatives. <br><br>  <b>And what do you suggest?</b>  <b>Let's discuss.</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Will Runet survive to 2015?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Yes. <br>  But how? </div></div><br><br>  PS Periodically, there may be problems with the built-in slides in the post - provided direct links to them if they are not displayed inside the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222027/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222027/</a></p>
