But, according to Matt Sigelman, director of the labor market research firm <a href="http://burning-glass.com/">Burning Glass</a> , it is even more difficult to find a person whose personal qualities and leadership skills correspond to his technical skills. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn IT, most people at the level of middle and top management have achieved their place because of their technical skills, and not because of personal qualities or managerial talent.  This means that some vacancies are very difficult to fill, since they require technical ingenuity, special experience and managerial skills.  If you require a candidate to sit in two chairs at once - technology and management - you complicate the task of filling vacancies, since the number of potential candidates decreases immediately, ‚Äùsays Sigelman. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Based on a study of Burning Glass 40,000 vacancies posted on sites from August 2015 to September 2016, a list of the most difficult to fill vacancies was built, and the average number of days required to search for the right employee was given.
