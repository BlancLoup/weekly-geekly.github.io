  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Website Advertising Arithmetic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The demand for advertising is huge, and the supply is very low in quality and the probability of getting to the tops is often equal to the probability of loss from search engines in general.  The situation is difficult and I will try to find reference points for choosing an advertising strategy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Serious firms engaged in the promotion of keywords take 500-1500 USD  per month, this is the norm.  And what does the client get from getting to the first page? <br><br>  We take the site with the open statistics "Pereezdam.net" (statistics - <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/stat/pereezdam.net/">www.liveinternet.ru/stat/pereezdam.net</a> ).  It is located on the first page of Yandex for the request ‚Äúorder of a gazelle‚Äù and ‚Äúservices of porters‚Äù.  This and other requests (except "relocation") are given to the site - <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/stat/pereezdam.net/queries.html">www.liveinternet.ru/stat/pereezdam.net/queries.html</a> - 1-5 visitors per day each. <br><br>  At the same time, Yandex.Direct gives the following query statistics: <br>  gazelle order - 2929 <br>  movers services - 1624 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      What do we see?  Very roughly: a thousand requests per month gives one visitor per day.  It is so small that an important request is only a ‚Äúrelocation‚Äù ... It gives 5-15 visitors per day.  As a result, a popular site gets 10-20 visitors per day from Yandex.  How much do you think they pay for it?  I do not know, but the general order is known - at least from 400 cu  per month.  It turns out 400u.e./ (20 * 30) = 66 cents per visitor.  Agree, this is a fairly standard situation.  The customer pays for finding 10-15 phrases on the first or second page of 500-1000 cu  and gets 50-100 visitors per day.  This is at best from 16 to 66 cents per visitor.  You can make similar simple calculations for your site. <br><br>  Thus, ordering advertising to SEOs is beneficial if the total number of requests in Yandex for your key phrases is in the hundreds of thousands, and the predicted attendance is hundreds of people a day.  That is, there is a certain threshold, to go beyond which is profitable only for fairly large companies.  For those who want to spend money on website promotion and attract new customers more efficiently, you need to use Yandex.Direct.  For a small business - perfect. <br><br>  If you do not include any autofocus and pick up a few hundred key phrases (here you need to steam up), while setting prices from 1 to 15 cents (!!!), then the attendance will be higher.  At the same time, visitors will remain targeted, some of them are gaining not "a gazelle order," but a "gazelle minibus order, Moscow."  They are few, but a drop wears away a stone. <br><br>  Very often there is such an argument in favor of SEO, that it is such an advertisement that gives a constant increase in TCI, etc., but recently links are simply bought or placed on their networks of sites.  When the client stops paying, these links disappear, and the TCI is with them.  Registration in specialized catalogs of sites (for example, furniture subjects) is already done ‚Äúin the appendage‚Äù, constituting the scanty part of the total volume of links.  SEO has another big drawback - it‚Äôs a long time to get results.  A direct works immediately. <br><br>  The cheapest way to promote was, is and will be the "news occasion".  Publicly refuse to cooperate with a large company, pour water over the interlocutor, etc. <br><br>  But for the "news" you have to be "someone."  With a good news story, there are a lot of visitors, but not all of them are targeted and it‚Äôs quite difficult to assess the benefits.  Is that the news will be of interest mainly to potential customers.  Therefore, the best promotion is to say that all other specialists are crap, interested people immediately react.  I really like the slogan of the network optician "Competitors!  Where are you competitors? ".  And in order to become someone you need good advertising - SEO, search engine optimization. <br>  I would like to note one more thing.  The domain name plays an important role in website advertising.  Zakaztaksi.ru will be more loved by search engines.  But you can not get involved in "key domains", because  This leads to the emergence of several different companies with the same domain sound.  By spinning yourself up you are spinning a competitor - this is stupid.  Call your company "Gruzolot.ru" or "Chaim!" And, seeing an unusual name once, a person remembers it, if not forever, then for a long time. <br><br>  The arithmetic of advertising sites does not diminish any of the methods of promotion, but shows some specificity that 90% of customers do not understand: <br>  - Up to 50-100 people per day is beneficial. Yandex.Direct <br>  - From hundreds to several thousand (you can‚Äôt jump higher) - search engine optimization and promotion. <br>  - Megopopularity - only due to advertising campaigns.  The cheapest of all is viral marketing, news feed, something amazing that everyone rushes to share. <br><br>  Thus, we form the procedure for the promotion of the site: <br><br>  1. Set up a company through <a href="http://direct.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Direct</a> , in a few visits to find a lot of key phrases.  The result - calls will start on the next day. <br><br>  2. Choose 3-4 key phrases whose query statistics number in the hundreds of thousands and order search advertising only for them.  The result will be only in two or three months. <br><br>  3. Find an area in which a potential client is interested and do non-standard actions in this area, preferably scandalous, if the image allows.  Then how lucky. <br><br>  4. Become a legend for everyone to quote. <br><br>  We are all on the way. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7553/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7553/</a></p>
