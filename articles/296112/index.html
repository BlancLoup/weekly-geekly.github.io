In April 2014, Edward sold his business and moved to Moscow to develop <a href="https://www.carprice.ru/">CarPrice</a> .  We asked Mr. Gurinovich to share his advice with the audience of ‚ÄúMegamind‚Äù and that's what we got. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  Growing a business from zero to gigantic sizes you will overcome obstacles of different levels of complexity, in various aspects, external and within the company, there will be a lot of factors that can mathematically kill a business at any stage.  Risk and business are almost synonymous.  The winner is the one who better than competitors manages the risks of a business, be it a corporation or a beer stand. </li><li>  Choose the right niche and market!  A big tide raises even a holey boat.  A large market provides more opportunities for experimentation and a little more chance that the market will forgive your erroneous hypotheses. </li><li>  Optimize everything you can!  Treat every cent in your business economically, if you can not buy something, it is better not to buy.  ;) </li><li>  At an early stage, take in the team not only those who are ready to come to a startup for the sake of an idea, but professionals.  Professionalism at a very early stage may look like a utopia, but it will save more money in the future. </li><li>  The less partners / investors you have, the better.  Honestly.  Yes.  the team certainly wins, not the founder or CEO, but any partner or investor imposes restrictions on making decisions, and at the very first stage it is better to accept them quickly. </li><li>  If you want to go into business only to earn a lot of money, then you better go to Gazprom!  (c) True!  The expectation of high income will be higher. </li><li>  Any business must be sellable.  Already starting a startup, think about who it may be useful for and who can sell it.  Start communicating with the investor in advance. </li><li>  Try to do a lot of tests and test a lot of hypotheses.  It is better to quickly make a rough version of the product and check it with the market than to nag the Grail for years. </li><li>  Any business relies on mathematics and logic.  Everything must be measurable and it is logical to flow from each other.  What we do not measure becomes uncontrollable. </li><li>  Get out of your comfort zone and do not stop growing and developing as a person!  No amount of money can buy you brains, and they can be grown only by solving complex, non-standard tasks. </li></ol><br><blockquote>  <i>Editorial note: if you have a desire to participate in the ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Tips‚Äù section, write to us at editor (at) megamozg.ru</i> </blockquote></div>
