      Due to the undoubted advantages of Big Data, more and more companies from a wide range of industries are starting to use, which means that existing strategies and programs must be developed to cope with the growing volume of tasks. <br><br>  Below we describe the key trends in Big Data, for which you need to be ready. <br><br><h2>  1. The addition of job responsibilities </h2><br>  The demand for Big Data analysts and employees who are familiar with big data language and methods is growing every year.  According to IBM's forecast, by 2020 more than 700 thousand vacancies will open for specialists of this profile. <br><br>  Commercial enterprises will plan in advance all kinds of trainings and training programs for employees to keep up with all the innovations in this area.  In addition, the functionality of traditional positions will be expanded, employees will learn to work competently with big data and, therefore, enjoy the new benefits that this technology provides.  As a result, we will come to the conclusion that absolutely all employees, not only representatives of IT departments, will master the methods of working with Big Data. <br><br>  Next year, 62% of companies plan to introduce machine learning and the main methods of analyzing Big Data, therefore, organizations will need to look for the most effective ways to adapt employees to these changes. <br><br>  Past experience confirms that companies and even entire industries that cannot adapt to changes are doomed to disappear.  Given that today a huge number of business projects involve working with Big Data, companies need ultra-reliable strategies for organizing routine processes. <br><br>  For this reason, the popularity of task management tools such as <a href="https://www.workzone.com/">Workzone is growing rapidly</a> .  This online resource has proven its effectiveness by helping large organizations to structure information on all sorts of projects of various sizes.  Thanks to the cloud storage, it is convenient to edit documents and send them to colleagues while away from the office.  Given the dynamic workflow, you can adjust the workload, keeping track of which tasks are allocated too much or, conversely, too few resources. <br><br>  In connection with the wide range of opportunities offered by programs of this type, in order to organize effective work of an enterprise, it will be necessary to reformulate the job responsibilities of the majority of employees.  The capabilities of artificial intelligence and Big Data can significantly increase productivity, but only if employees learn to use the potential of new methods to the full. <br><br><h2>  2. Hyper-customization of user experience </h2><br>  Thanks to the extensive analysis capabilities of Big Data, customer interaction will now be even more personalized and targeted.  With the development of predictive analysis, both e-commerce giants and startups have gained access to information that helps to make communication with each consumer highly personalized. <br><br>  Big data analysis allows online trading companies to become more familiar with customers by tracking their recent purchases and analyzing their buying habits.  Shopify, one of the largest electronic trading platforms, is already actively using this advantage of Big Data, analyzing customer accounts.  Shopify's expanded scorecard includes a conversion funnel and order value, and customer buying habits are tracked in real time. <br><br>  Personalization can lead to a significant increase in sales.  Revenues of companies that used such strategies to promote products and form targeted offers grew by 10%.  In 2018, even more companies will use personalization; moreover, it will become even more thorough. <br><br><h2>  3. Improvement of blockchain technologies </h2><br>  Distrust of consumers - one of the most serious problems associated with Big Data.  49% of Americans believe that their personal information is not protected.  Every year, more and more cases of information leaks are recorded, which means that cybersecurity is becoming a growing priority for organizations and individuals, because financial transactions and personal interaction are actively moving to the online environment. <br><br>  Next year, improving <a href="https://binarydistrict.com/ru/courses/zero-knowledge-proof-protocols/">cybersecurity methods is</a> not only expected, but absolutely necessary.  And therefore, one of the main trends in 2018 will definitely be the development of <a href="https://binarydistrict.com/ru/courses/blockchain-weekend/">blockchain technologies</a> . <br><br>  Blockchain encrypts Bitcoin transactions and other Big Data transactions containing private, confidential information.  Blockchain is practically invulnerable, because the transmitted information is not concentrated in one place, but broken into fragments and scattered in different addresses for security purposes. <br><br>  In 2018, in areas where big data transactions occur, for example, in the banking and healthcare sectors, more advanced methods for implementing blockchain technology will be applied.  According to IBM, 90% of government organizations will contribute to the development of blockchain technology in order to increase the international level of cyber security. <br><br><h2>  4. AI will become mainstream </h2><br>  In 2017, Twitter bots and voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa were very popular - artificial intelligence gradually transformed from a science fiction attribute to a part of our daily life.  AI is improving every day, and the end user gets the most benefit from it: he is the one who enjoys the bizarre combination of human qualities and manufacturability. <br><br>  According to Forrester, in 2018 most organizations will finally understand the need to integrate artificial intelligence - and its complexity too.  Using the power of artificial intelligence for everyday operations, company leaders are fully aware of all the advantages of this technology. <br><br>  In 2018, Dell plans to actively integrate artificial intelligence into real life.  After several years of active research and development, Dell EMC will introduce mass enterprises to new machine and deep learning methods. <br><br>  Due to the existence of different high-performance software packages, any enterprise, regardless of their size, will be able to choose the functions that meet their specific needs.  Undoubtedly, in 2018, the example of Dell will be followed by many other technological giants, and new original ways of introducing artificial intelligence into everyday life will be found. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347876/</a></p>
