For 7 years I have been programming.  Gradually, I began to notice a ‚Äúdecline in activity‚Äù - I don‚Äôt want to learn new things, I‚Äôm not just doing laziness, but mega-laziness, databases and XML processing ‚Äî I‚Äôm already sitting in my liver.  And suddenly I realize that programming is ... <i>tired of</i> me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/acb/dd6/c9b/acbdd6c9b020e5012dcd730955fa8cc3.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  What now?  How to be?  Who is guilty?  After all, programming is what I always loved most.  And the most important thing is what <b>I do for a living</b> .  And I can no longer "do it".

      <br>
      I will try to look at the problem from all sides.  Let's start with the sad. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Minuses.</b>  Why <i>you need to</i> get rid of the problem. <br><br>  1. Experience, as they say, you do not drink.  But you can slide it into the drawer on your own and never use it.  At the same time, experience is an important thing, it just does not appear and it is insulting to lose it. <br><br>  2. If there is no other education, then it will be difficult to find another job (except for the janitor), to put it mildly.  Especially if there is already a ‚Äúheated‚Äù programmer place with a good salary. <br><br>  3. If programming is a ‚Äúnatural talent‚Äù, it would be foolish, say, to practice ballroom dancing.  With bears.  On the mountain.  At night.  :) <br><br>  <b>Pros.</b> <br><br>  1. The ability to find yourself in other areas.  Although this is also a minus - the one who "digs" under one stone for years has been most successful. <br><br>  <b>How to get rid?</b> <br><br>  <i>Cause.</i> <br><br>  As a rule, the cause is not laziness that has grown unexpectedly.  Any other factors.  Let's try to consider them. <br><br>  1. "Interesting lesson" has become a routine.  It is one thing to load the brain with something new and learn something, another thing is to pick one another day in the day in the tired, say, scripts.  If it is clear to you at once how to create this or that project, then after a while you will no longer enjoy the process of creation.  And the project itself will begin to assemble from previously written ready-made "blocks", which will reduce the level of happiness in the minus finally. <br><br>  2. Tired of freelancing.  If you are not working ‚Äúfor an uncle‚Äù, it may well turn out that you are tired of searching for a customer, ‚Äúulamivanie‚Äù, contracts, payment, terms and so on.  Very often occurs in conjunction with paragraph 1. <br><br>  3. General fatigue.  When you do not want to do something that programming, but generally do not want anything. <br><br>  4. The situation.  It is annoying to sit down on the same chair in the same office (or at home) and sit in a row for 10 hours. <br><br>  <i>Decision.</i> <br><br>  I will try to suggest my own methods, some have been tried on themselves and they actually work. <br><br>  1. What should be done to make the routine not such a routine?  Two options - "internal" and "external." <br><br>  Internal: try to learn new technology and try to implement it in most of your projects.  Don't know Ajax?  Learn!  Not sure how to work with databases in C ++ Builder?  Forward!  Try to do something that will make the gears in your brain move. <br><br>  Put another operating system.  Change the editor in which you write the code or at least its ‚Äútheme‚Äù (color scheme).  Surprisingly, when I changed colors in my editor to ‚Äúvim-style‚Äù, I worked for 3 days with the feeling that I was just a beginner, the trees were big, and the projects were interesting. <br><br>  "External".  Change the language in which you write.  Do you write in PHP?  Learn ASP!  Finally, figure out what's behind the "pointers" in C ++ and arrange yourself as a C programmer. <br><br>  2. I am freelancing definitely tired.  I do not feel former responsibility when I communicate with a person through text messages.  Customers have become ‚Äúone person‚Äù, and the scripts that I make for them seem completely useless to me (and why do they need all this?).  It was terrible to begin to strain the competition, tired of being afraid for the ‚Äúdisadvantages‚Äù on the exchanges, if I don‚Äôt meet the deadlines. <br><br>  Only one option - try to work on your uncle.  And there is nothing ‚Äúsuch‚Äù in it.  Maybe the opposite will please. <br><br>  3. This is a very important question.  The question of physical and psychological health.  It is very important to get enough sleep, go to bed earlier.  It is important not to drink a lot of alcohol.  It is important to arrange a rest (experiment - what kind of rest gives the greatest relaxation, except for heroin, of course). <br><br>  If you work ‚Äúfor wear‚Äù (not necessarily physically, but emotionally, for example), the fuse will very quickly disappear.  And then "and do not raise your hand." <br><br>  Play sports.  The best medicine.  Constantly sitting is definitely cool, but it is even better to feel full of strength until the end of the day. <br><br>  4. Again, it looks like freelancing.  Change the situation!  Buy a laptop, try to work in a cafe.  Change the place of work or change the interior of the workplace.  Buy a new mug in the end. <br><br>  Summarizing. <br><br>  The review is, of course, very brief.  And I still ask myself questions from sabzh - what to do if you get bored with what you have been doing for a long time and what do you like? <br><br>  Universal hint: change.  Change anything, at least in the details.  Remove, finally, a mess on the table.  Set the table on the other side of the room.  Any, even insignificant, detail brings a variety of proven fact.  Many small details - a lot of variety.  The main thing is <i>not to get used</i> (to the situation, lifestyle, schedule, anything). <br><br>  What is your opinion on this?  Have you encountered similar?  How to decide and decide whether?  Thank.  The question is urgent for me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87045/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87045/</a></p>
