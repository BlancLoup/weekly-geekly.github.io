My name is Artem, I am the founder and head of <a href="http://junktale.com/">junktale.com</a> . <br><br> <a href="http://junktale.com/"><img src="http://junktale.com/images/junktale_box_big1.jpg" alt="Junktale" title="Junktale"></a> <br><br>  As a person who swallows a huge amount of literature, some time ago I began to notice that after I began to read many books, I began to skim through, trying to catch at least something.  Most biographies and documentary books, unfortunately, contain a lot of information "noise", a text that does not carry anything useful.  And interesting episodes are rare.  But when such episodes were found, at least a couple or three per book, I did not consider time wasted.

      If the biography of a person or a book describing some events was interesting, it was literally full of funny, unusual and interesting stories and episodes. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea is this: why not make a project that somehow resembles Wikipedia, but focuses on the brightest and most interesting moments in life, short stories describing a person or an event?  Suppose if we take the biography of Salvador Dali on Wikipedia, we can read how he was born, what pictures he wrote, where he went, etc., but to find out about his many eccentricities and adventures, you already need to dig deeper into his diaries and biographies.  Here is an example of a story that we won‚Äôt find on Wikipedia: <br><br><blockquote>  One day an old friend of his father came to the famous artist <a href="http://junktale.com/catalog/artists/salvador_dali/">Salvador Dali</a> , who wanted to ask to confirm the authorship of one of his old paintings.  Dali announced to him that the picture is authentic, even without looking at it.  The old man was surprised at this answer, but insisted that Dali still look at the canvas, which he left at the entrance. <br>  ‚ÄúCome and see ... I put it next to the stuffed bear.‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúThat is impossible,‚Äù Dali replied.  - Just behind the bear, His Majesty the King is now changing his bathing suit. <br>  ‚ÄúAll kidding,‚Äù the old man said with a slight reproach in his voice. <br>  In fact, Dali told the truth, that very morning the king of Italy, Umberto, did indeed visit him. </blockquote><br>  Or another example <a href="http://junktale.com/catalog/war/great_patriotic_war/">from the history of the Great Patriotic War</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  From the diary of ambulance doctor AG Dreitser (Moscow): ‚ÄúThe air raid has just ended.  I leave on the outskirts of the city, the victim of the bombing.  About eight wooden houses have been demolished, logs are still smoldering, there are many holes from shells on the field.  The homeless sit on the sidewalk on their wretched belongings.  In bomb shelters, we find six seriously wounded women and old people among the corpses. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Our global and naive task is to make an alternative to Wikipedia a source of knowledge, built on the principle of presenting information in the form of such short, bright stories-episodes.  Suppose I want to learn something about the Great Patriotic War.  I can again go to Wikipedia, and learn the chronology of events.  But personally, it would be much more interesting for me to look at the war through the eyes of eyewitnesses, and preferably not from one point of view, but from several.  Read episodes-stories from the lives of soldiers who participated in the war, find out what was happening to them, so to speak, "from the first person."  This can be compared with the way we look at the battlefield, flying over it on an airplane (reading the chronology or biography), or personally participating in the battle (life stories).  In the second case, I do not see the whole picture as a whole, but I am more acutely immersed in the atmosphere of what is happening. <br><br>  How is this implemented on Junktale?  Each story published and approved by moderators is ‚Äúattached‚Äù to the page of the person or object.  After that, anyone who enters the character page will be able to read stories from his life.  For example <a href="http://junktale.com/catalog/music/john_lennon/">stories from the life of John Lennon</a> . <br><br>  Now the site publishes more than 30 episodes-stories per day, and we are trying to increase the quantity and quality of published information.  Of course, the task is very voluminous, and it will be very difficult for junktale to become the largest library of stories.  But why not try? :) <br><br>  The project is just launched, and it would be interesting to hear your opinion: tips, suggestions and suggestions.  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133738/</a></p>
