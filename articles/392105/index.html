Forgotten ABC Project</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Until the 70s, it was believed that the first electronic digital computer (ENIAC) was created by John Mockley and John P. Eckert as far back as 40 years.  In 1973, the lawsuit between Sperry Rand and Honeywell for the authorship of the invention of an electronic computer was completed.  Sperry acquired a patent for ENIAC and after that the company collected a percentage of other companies that were involved in the development of computers.  Honeywell did not want to pay, after which Sperry corporation sued them, but it was not there: a counterclaim was brought against them.  Sperry was accused of using an invalid patent and thereby violating antitrust law.  Honeywell representatives cited the Atanasoff computer design created before ENIAC.  Atanasov was found that the most interesting, he was not well acquainted with the device ENIAC.  The design features of his ABC computer were used in the ENIAC computer.  John V. Atanasov - a scientist from Iowa, in 30 years he created the first electronic computer, which worked on the basis of the binary number system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/570/a91/101/570a91101e804064accdfe72779e74fe.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On October 4, 1903, John Vincent Atanasov was born a few miles west of Hamilton, New York, on a farm belonging to his grandfather, in a family of immigrants from Bulgaria.  He was the first child in the family of John (Ivan) Atanasov (1876-1956) and Yves Lausen Pardy (1881-1983).  His father was an engineer, and his mother - a teacher of mathematics at school.  The family had nine children (one of them died): John, Ethelin, Margaret, Theodore, Avis, Raymond, Melva and Irving. <br><br>  John wrote about his parents:

      ‚ÄúMy father was born on January 6 in 1876, our people were just preparing for an uprising against the Turks (the April anti-Ottoman uprising in Bulgaria occurred April 18 - May 23, 1876 and was brutally suppressed by the Turks, it is considered the culmination of the Bulgarian national liberation movement against Ottoman oppression , during the uprising killed from 25 to 50 thousand Bulgarians).  People who lived in our village were asked to leave their homes with their families, after which the houses were burned.  My grandmother ran with the child (my father) in the hands of the grandfather ... a shot sounded ... one of the Turkish soldiers shot my grandfather right in the chest, he fell dead, ricocheted a bullet hurt my father and left a scar for the rest of his life, as a terrible reminder of those events .  Grandma married a second time.  At 15, my father arrived in the United States, at 15 he was left an orphan.  Here he graduated from Colgate University (American College of Humanities in Hamilton, Madison State of New York).  Later he married my American mother, my mother‚Äôs grandfather took part in the civil war between North and South. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70b/d32/fd3/70bd32fd36f6477e8918221e0cccfda3.png"><br>  <i>with Mother</i> <br><br>  The incident that occurred at that time is a documented fact in the history of the Bulgarian people (the so-called Massacre in the Boyadjik).  On May 11, 1876, the Turkish army attacked and plundered the village of Boyadzhik, killing almost two hundred unarmed people, mostly women and children.  Only a miracle saved Atanasov‚Äôs father from certain death. <br><br>  "... hundreds, thousands of Bulgarians of all ages and both sexes died under the most terrible circumstances; the details of the atrocities committed are terrible; the whole population was massacred in Perushtitsa, Batak, Vetren. Recently, the village of Boyadzhik near Yambol experienced the same fate. Women and girls were raped, killed and taken away as slaves, killed children, killed peasants fleeing when the troops approached, killed and those who stayed with them, killed those who hid, and those who donated weapons, because they had them, and which he was not - because they are not his  they were given; they were shooting cars on employees on the railway line ... armed gangs roam the country, taking all that can be taken away from the peasants, and regular troops appear at the slightest resistance to betray everything to fire and sword. " <br><br>  Ivan Atanasov arrived in the USA with his uncle in 1889, the name Ivan was changed by the immigration service na - John.  After graduating from Colgate University in 1890, Atanasov‚Äôs parents got married and moved to New Jersey, where his father got a job as an engineer.  My father continued his studies in the evening and at night, attended courses, was fond of electrical engineering and electronics.  After the birth of John, the family moved to Florida, where his father got a job in a new town Brewster as an engineer at a power station, at the moment it is a ghost town. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60f/698/7f9/60f6987f9c6248aaa92c4f02fa706524.png"><br>  <i>Brewster Town</i> <br><br>  John graduated from elementary school here, at that time he was interested in everything related to electricity. At 9 years old, he discovered a fault in the wiring on the back porch and was able to repair it.  By the way, his father was the first in the district to conduct electrical wiring in his house.  John was developed beyond his years, learned to read early, and loved everything he could learn from books.  He studied well, was a diligent student, was interested in sports, especially was keen on baseball.  But baseball's fascination melted away like fog, after his father presented him with a slide rule, it is believed that before the advent of pocket calculators, this tool was simply indispensable for engineers in the calculations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/892/5fa/2ff/8925fa2fff5e411cbe52334ecb4925cc.JPG"><br><br>  "This slide rule was my favorite toy, baseball was almost forgotten when I began a serious study of logarithms."  At the age of 10 he studied physics and chemistry, was engaged in mathematics, somehow his mother gave him a book, which dealt with calculations in other number systems other than decimal. <br><br>  While still in school, Atanasov mastered differential calculus, and his father took him to the factory and showed the work of the generator.  This all determined his further choice.  When the boy needed to go to high school, the family moved to a farm in Old Chicora, Florida.  In two years at the age of 15, Atanasov graduated from Mulberry High School with honors in mathematical disciplines.  He decided that to be a theoretical physicist was his vocation.  But he had to work for a year in phosphate mines to earn money.  In 1921, John entered the University of Florida at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2f/248/7d8/b2f2487d860d4bb3b1a9eb95440fc8d3.png"><br><br>  Atanasov spent much of his time in the university‚Äôs mechanical and foundry workshops.  He graduated from a university in 1925 with a bachelor's degree with the best marks and received a scholarship to study for a master's degree in mathematics and physics from the state of Iowa.  He was offered training at many higher educational institutions, such as Harvard, but he decided to continue his studies in Ames. <br><br>  In the summer of 1925, John graduated from Iowa and received a degree in electrical engineering, he was immediately engaged in teaching and conducted two mathematical classes.  In 1926, John married a young blue-eyed brunette Lure Mix from Oklahoma.  A year later, they had a daughter, Elsie, and the family moved to Wisconsin, where Atanasov (May 1930) defended his doctoral dissertation.  Two other children, twins Joan and John, were born a year later. <br><br>  In March 1929, he became a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin and continued his studies in theoretical physics.  While working on his doctoral thesis, Atanasov had to do a lot of calculations, his topic was polarizing helium in an electric field, he spent hours doing calculations using the Monroe calculator, one of the most advanced computing devices of the time.  At that time, analog solution methods using the Vannevar-Bush differential analyzer could no longer satisfy inquiries due to inaccuracies, while devices that would implement a digital approach simply simply did not exist.  And so, at such moments, Atanasov understood that the time had come to develop something that could help make the calculations much faster, more precisely, the thought of automating the solution of large linear algebraic equations did not leave him.  Atanasov even tried to modify the IBM calculator. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EozhU6rybHY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjar9UZ36IGElRt8qLSBI-NsvdAzA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Therefore, after returning to Iowa State College, where he worked as an assistant professor of mathematics and physics, he seriously began developing and creating a high-speed computing machine.  He conducted experiments with vacuum tubes, radio, studied electronics.  Atanasov studied many of the computing devices available at the time, and came to the conclusion that they can be divided into two classes of analog devices and computers (but the term "digital computer" began to be used later).  In 1936, Atanasov tried to create a small analog calculator.  In Iowa, no one except John was involved in the creation of new computers, here he calmly thought about his ideas, but on the other hand there were no specialists with whom he could discuss his ideas on the spot, understand the technical and theoretical problems that had arisen.  Such a lonely inventor. <br><br>  John Atanasov originally thought of creating an analog device, something like his favorite slide rule, but the fact that the length of such linear films for the exact solution of linear algebraic equations would be hundreds of meters was obvious.  The limitations of analog computing tools pushed the scientist to create something ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù.  How to keep the numbers in the car - that was the first task that Atanasov tried to solve.  This is how the term ‚Äúmemory‚Äù appeared to describe this function in a car.  What types of memory just did not go through Atanasov and mechanical pins, and electromagnetic relays, and electronic lamps.  Since the electron tubes were expensive at the time, he decided to use capacitors.  Capacitors themselves are small and inexpensive components that could keep an electrical charge for a while, but you could forget about the small size of the machine and its speed with this kind of memory. <br><br>  The second task that he had to solve was called the ‚Äúcomputational mechanism‚Äù.  For this mechanism, Atanasov decided to use electron tubes that would be used as on / off switches with on / off functions.  At this stage, a dilemma arose, what system of calculus to use in the car (even the calculus system with a base on one seemed to the scientist promising).  In the end, the binary number system was chosen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d7/3b6/023/4d73b60230f94db6a487fb61e6f9fc16.png"><br><br>  Atanasov still had one passion - cars.  He tried every year to buy a new one (it‚Äôs not known whether the previous ones sold).  One of the winter evenings of 1937 in a roadside tavern, where Atanasov drove on a new Ford with a powerful V8 engine, he was visited by the idea and on what principles a new computing device should be created.  The essence of these principles was formulated by him later, namely, that it consisted in the fact that electricity would be used for computer operation, and it would be based not on the usual decimal number system, but on the binary one. <br><br>  "... once in the winter evening of 1937 I felt completely exhausted by the inability to find a solution to the problems associated with the design of the car. I got into the car, accelerated and drove for so long until I controlled my emotions. It was my habit - I did regain control of myself after driving along the road, concentrating on driving, but that night I was too exhausted and continued to rush until I crossed the Mississippi River and found myself in Illinois, 300 kilometers from  where I got into the car ... (I went to the tavern and ordered a drink) I felt that I was not so nervous anymore, and my thoughts turned again to the computers. I don‚Äôt know why my head started working and why it didn‚Äôt work before but it was nice, cool and quiet. " <br><br>  The principles of the future computing machine, Atanasov sketched on a napkin, he thought about what the design of the regenerative memory would be, called it ‚Äúdiscrete‚Äù, he came up with putting capacitors on rotating cylindrical drums (from under the cans of juice), every second they would come into contact with brushes (in the form of cables) and would charge.  The memory, consisting of capacitors, would be ‚Äúshaken‚Äù by the brushes when the rotating cylinders were rotated, and, if necessary, the old data would be removed and new data would be entered.  The invented logical electronic circuit made it possible to read numbers from two different cylinders with capacitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/756/cdd/b3c/756cddb3c90b46a9a5b005d9bec7621b.png"><br><br>  Work has begun on the creation of a prototype.  An assistant was needed, so in 1939 Atanasov got acquainted with Berry, who at that time was a graduate of the electrotechnical department, well versed in electronics. <br><br>  The work on ABC (Atanasoff ‚Äî Berry Computer) lasted three years, and the first prototype was demonstrated as early as 1939 and its goal was to solve a system of linear equations, the system could work with 29 variables, it processed two equations and removed one of the variables, and the resulting the equation would output on binary punch cards of sizes 8x11, after that maps with a simpler system of equations would be fed back to the machine, the process would start anew.  All this would reduce such calculations with 29 variables.  On a calculator, it would take 10 weeks, and on a computer, only 7!  days  But still it would be a very long process. <br><br>  ABC used binary arithmetic.  The word length was 50 bits.  Punch cards with intermediate results contained thirty 50-bit binary numbers.  The car had two memorable devices, which consisted of rotating drums, to which small capacitors were attached, connected to a brass contact on the surface of the drum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db2/d39/217/db2d392174b046d58a36f9970fd70f20.png"><br><br>  5/6 of the peripheral surface of the drum was occupied by brass contacts, and 1/6 remained empty, which provided time for other operations.  The speed of the contacts past the reading brush was 60 per second. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5be/66d/afd/5be66dafd20c42b393ad09c66b4e8426.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0db/551/d64/0db551d64a674b0e9ff348135dbe2210.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c0/960/3dc/5c09603dc71942f9ac8cccc64234b57b.png"><br><br>  According to Berry: <br>  "... the polarity of the charge on the capacitor indicated‚Äú one ‚Äùor‚Äú zero ‚Äù, and each capacitor was recharged immediately after reading, so that the charge never stayed on it for more than one second. All words were processed in parallel, but inside each word the numbers were processed sequentially. that before designing the memory on capacitors, we seriously considered the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing magnetic drums, but abandoned it due to the low level of signals. There were 30 identical arithmetic devices that  They were essentially binary adders. Each consisted of a series of direct-connected vacuum tubes (seven dual triodes) interconnected in such a way that they performed binary addition. Each device had three inputs (two for added or subtracted numbers and one for for transfer from the previous place) and two exits (one for the result at that place, and the other for transfer to another place). " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ed/ada/a8c/4edadaa8c6c1455193d898cb4a46458a.png"><br><br>  The conversion of decimal numbers into binary ones was carried out with the help of a rotating drum on which there were contacts representing binary equivalents of 1.2 - 9.10.20 - 9x14.  At the output, the same apparatus in the reverse order transformed and gave the decimal result to the mechanical counter. <br><br>  Atanasov printed on 35 pages a description of such a machine in the hope of obtaining funding for this project.  The expenses amounted to slightly more than 5 thousand dollars, but he later received funding from a private foundation.  The lawyer who was hired by the University of Iowa, for some reason, did not file a patent application. <br><br>  In 1940, Atanassov and Berry invited Mokli (a physicist from Ursinus College) to Iowa ‚Äúto help‚Äù after Atanasov listened to his lecture on ‚Äúthe possibility of using analog computers to solve meteorological problems‚Äù in Pennsylvania.  In 1941, Mocli visited Atanasov‚Äôs house and the three of them talked about the ABC digital computer for 5 days, but Atanasov asked for the materials to be kept secret.  So this fateful meeting of Atanasov and Mokli took place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b1/8c8/367/6b18c8367c1d48d2bfc48ad6a92683a5.png"><br>  <i>Soaking</i> <br><br>  Mocli arrived on Friday evening June 13 from Washington.  Atanasov was ready to show his partially assembled car, in spite of his wife‚Äôs warnings that She was not quite an honest person, and ABC was not yet patented.  Soaking impressed a couple of things - the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing capacitors in the memory unit and the method of replenishing their charge once a second, placing them on a rotating cylinder. <br><br>  This is what Mokli recalled about this meeting and the car Atanasov-Berry he saw: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI thought that his car was much more cunning, but since it turned out to be partly mechanical, including rotating commuting switches, it did not look like what I meant.  I was no longer interested in the details.  The semi-mechanical nature of the Atanasoff machine made me rather frustrated.  He had nothing in the plans that would make the machine more universal and would allow it to solve any other problems besides solving a system of linear equations. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúTherefore, when the legal proceedings for supremacy among electronic computers began, in his testimonies, Mokley said that this visit meant nothing to him than visiting an exhibition in which he simply picked up some ideas.‚Äù  The main difference between Mokli and Atanasov was his desire and ability to work in a team.  As a result, Mokli and his talented team went down in history as the inventors of the first electronic computer.  And then, as Moqley claimed, these were his ideas, which were supplemented by ideas, the experience of other talented scientists, during conversations with them, while visiting various exhibitions.  After visiting Atanasov, Mocli was invited to take an electronics course at the University of Pennsylvania.  All this encouraged him to create a computer and by the autumn of 1941, Mokley had completed his version of the computer.  Here the story of ENIAK begins.  The first is a fully electronic digital computer, which was assembled under strict secrecy for military purposes at the University of Pennsylvania. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56d/1cb/678/56d1cb67883444c893ce63d1a8253648.png"><br><br>  Let's return to Atanasov and his car. <br><br>  And so after three years, by 1942, the car was almost ready.  The size of such a computer was from a desk, and such a machine consisted of 300 electron tubes.  The problem was the mechanism for burning holes in punch cards with a spark (it worked through time). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c5/998/bd0/8c5998bd04af438bb3efdb2c7a1a18b6.png"><br><br>  1942 came, the war years forced Atanasov to postpone the work on the ABC project.  He was called to serve in the navy and was appointed head of the Department of Acoustics at the Naval Artillery Laboratory (NOL) in Washington, Columbia.  His salary was 10 thousand dollars and he worked here on the problem of acoustic mines, participated in the testing of the atomic bomb on the Bikini Atoll.  At this time, Atanasov‚Äôs computer was gathering dust in the basement at the University of Iowa, was dismantled by some graduate student, as it occupied a lot of space.  About her was forgotten.  Neither Atanasov nor Berry was notified that their offspring had been dismantled and only a third part of it was preserved. <br><br>  In 1949, Atanasov divorced his first wife.  Lura moved with her children to Denver.  That same year, John married Alice Grosby for the second time. <br><br>  Even if ABC were remembered, this machine had limitations: the process was slowed down due to mechanically rotating memory cells and even the system of burning holes in the punched card slowed down the work of such a computer.  In order to speed up the speed of such a computer, it was necessary to make it fully electronic and programmable. <br><br>  In 1945, the Artillery Department appealed to John Atanasov with a request to assist in designing a computer for the Naval Artillery Laboratory.  Atanasov abandoned the project, arguing that he could not simultaneously work on a computer project and finish work in the Department of Acoustics NOL. <br><br>  After the war, Atanasov returned to computers.  He regretted that he had thrown work on the creation of a computer, since his work was truly revolutionary.  Until 1949 he was head of the NOL acoustics department.  In 1950-1951, he was director of the NOL explosions program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ccc/15e/1ce/ccc15e1ce8874e62934214f927fd3371.png"><br><br>  In 1952, John Atanasov opened the company "Artillery Engineering Corporation" in the city of Frederick, Maryland, later Atanasov worked as an automation consultant in a packaging company. <br><br>  One fine day in 1954, a lawyer from IBM came to Atanasov, with a proposal to prove that it was Atanasov who was the first to create an electronic computer, and the ENIAC project was simply borrowed from the ABC project.  Atanasov decided to fight for the championship of his project. <br><br>  "... Atanasov became increasingly convinced that ENIAC was borrowed from his ABC and that this work should be continued. Moreover, he was given strength by the recognition of his services in other countries, particularly in his ancestors' homeland, Bulgaria, which in 1970 awarded him with an order Cyril and Methodius I degree ". <br><br>  The judge‚Äôs sentence was: <br><br>  ‚ÄúEckert and Mokley,‚Äù Judge Larson read, ‚Äúdid not themselves invent this automatic electronic digital computer, but instead borrowed this idea from Dr. John V. Atanasoff, and therefore the ENIAC patent is invalid.‚Äù <br><br>  John Vincent Atanasov (after a heart beat in 1975) spent the rest of his life on his farm near Monroville, Maryland.  He died on June 15, 1995, at the age of 92. <br><br>  Although Atanasov's machine was neither universal, nor programmable, nor fully electronic, the scientist deserves to be considered a pioneer, one who invented the first partially electronic digital computer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392105/</a></p>
