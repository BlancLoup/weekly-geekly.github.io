The new solution is deployed on the IBM Cloud cloud infrastructure, the distinctive features of which are flexibility, ease of management and scalability. <br><br>  Pre-accelerator GenerationS is an educational program in which 2159 participants acquire basic knowledge in the field of technological entrepreneurship and refine their projects.  An important part of the pre-accelerator is an online educational program, which consists of eight stages, each of which includes video lectures, test items, work of entrepreneurs on their project, expert advice and mentors.  Training takes place through an online educational platform, where each student (startup) has his own personal account, which records the progress in mastering the educational program.  The personal cabinets of experts and mentors show the results of those start-ups for which they act as individual teachers.  The system was developed by GVA LaunchGurus and RVK specifically for the GenerationS pre-accelerator. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  GenerationS is a federal accelerator of technology startups, during which the best projects selected by the results of a multi-stage expertise receive intensive development and wide opportunities for attracting investments.  GenerationS has been held by RVC since 2013 with the support of Russian corporations, development institutions, and representatives of venture infrastructure. <br>  Since 2015, GenerationS resources have been used to create corporate and industry accelerators in close cooperation with large Russian corporations.  Corporations are directly involved in the selection, examination of projects and acceleration of startups participating in GenerationS, based on their needs for innovative developments. <br>  GenerationS-2015 is conducted in seven industry-specific areas (tracks): Power &amp; Energy, Telecom Idea, Robotics, Aerospace, SmartCity, Oil &amp; Gas, BiotechMed.  All participants of corporate accelerators will be given the opportunity to receive a grant in the amount of 1 million rubles from the Foundation for Assistance to the Development of Small Enterprises in the Scientific and Technical Sphere.  Three winners of GenerationS will share the prize pool from RVC and partners, the minimum size of the prize fund is 5 million rubles. </blockquote>

According to the results of the Preaccelerator, IBM experts will select the 5 most promising startups in the field of cloud technologies to participate in the IBM Global Entrepreneur program.  More information about the IBM program can be obtained at the link: <a href="http://ibm.biz/CloudStartup">ibm.biz/CloudStartup</a> . <br><br>  As for the <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/ru/ru/pressrelease/39294.wss">Global Entrepreneur</a> program, Alexey Polunin, leaders of the IBM Cloud ecosystem development group, spoke about the essence of the project: ‚ÄúThe Global Entrepreneur program is an IBM partner program for start-up and technology entrepreneurs working in the field of cloud technologies, analytics, mobile apps and social interaction.  This is, in essence, an IBM Business Partner Acceleration Program for business areas such as cloud services, big data analytics, e-commerce, online game development, digital marketing, cognitive analytics, and artificial intelligence.  Participation in the program is free.  Upon graduation, all graduates of the program receive the status of an official partner of the IBM PartnerWorld program with the assignment of a corresponding IBM Business Partner ID. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ef/511/cb8/6ef511cb890d307b67c37271c1c24a08.jpg" width="510"><br><br>  To make possible the joint work of 400 experts and more than two thousand startups, a number of innovative solutions have been implemented within the framework of the platform.  Experts and mentors assess the academic performance of projects and their mastery of material in accordance with a complex point system, which takes into account the importance of various educational units in the overall system of education.  The participants' progress is displayed as a set of graphs.  This allows teachers to monitor the student‚Äôs progress and gives new experts the opportunity to quickly get involved in the learning process of a particular startup at any stage. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTo reach a large, geographically distant audience, we were looking for a scalable and reliable hybrid cloud solution that would meet not only our quality standards, but also the expectations of GenerationS program participants,‚Äù said Zamir Shukhov, executive director of <a href="http://gvalaunch.guru/">GVA LaunchGurus</a> .  - We opted for the IBM Cloud, which fully meets our requirements in terms of reliability, ability to withstand any peak loads, reaction speeds and ease of use.  Our platform allows us to simultaneously unite more than 2500 thousand people from all over Russia and provide them with access to unique educational content, with the ability to quickly monitor participants' progress and provide them with online expert support as part of the GenerationS pre-accelerator. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263051/</a></p>
