The care of the operator was in question even with one camera.  And in today's mega-quantities of small video-windows (with a huge resolution) to find something alarming is a completely unsolvable task.  Unless, of course, apply more advanced technology.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0f/7f9/ab1/f0f7f9ab1c93437fab50aa9c1f4dd72e.jpg"><br><br>  For the initial processing of video content, we chose not mythical intersections of lines, constantly reacting to all sorts of interference and rarely responding to useful goals, but the technology ‚Äú <b>Short Data</b> ‚Äù, which is not associated with pattern recognition.  We can tell you more about it next time, if you're interested.  But she, albeit many times, only eliminates the slags of non-informative data, highlighting the useful grain.  And then again - in front of the screen man. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/6f8/b93/d296f8b93df345dfb33212441b10d00e.jpg"><br><br>  The <a href="http://ip-concierge.com/">security company</a> comes to us on <a href="http://ip-concierge.com/">video</a> not in the form of 24-hour huge video streams, but even from a large number of video surveillance objects - just one tiny stream of already preprocessed data.  Video events from all objects go to the general pool of the Video Center and are distributed to free operators, whose task is to determine whether there is a crime in the plot, whether the apartment‚Äôs door opens to the profile of authorized persons or other conditions described in the client‚Äôs service. <br><br>  For the observer, this is a crazy video, because there is no bundle in this queue: the operator sees the event in the entrance of the city of Makhachkala, then on Karaganda street, then in the courtyard of a private house near Khabarovsk.  Before him are the plots, between which there is nothing in common.  He does not even have time to rejoice at someone's Rolls-Royce in St. Petersburg or be upset over a broken window in the Samara village.  By the way, the names of cities and addresses are also not available. The human brain is used only to determine the fact of crime in the very plot of the event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63f/b97/aad/63fb97aada95442e89f7c93961fe24be.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The brain is like a cog</b> , no immersion into the aura of an object, as we imagine any movie.  Without comprehensive coverage of the information and a comprehensive analysis of the situation.  This may seem like an unreliable tool to some, but the majority of the population has long believed that video surveillance doesn‚Äôt even need a person - the computer itself can analyze and recognize.  By our faith, the centrists, we believe only in the possibility of progress, but also do not believe in what we have not yet been able to prove.  Therefore, with all large-scale video analytics, the final touch in the analysis is left to the person. <br><br>  At the same time, <b>we remove everything that is inherent in the human factor</b> : emotions, inattention, analysis errors, drowsiness, forgetfulness, addressing component ... We turn it into a machine screw of a common system, but an important screw is a <b>natural noise filter</b> .  No computer will completely distinguish a flock of birds from a thief climbing over the fence, his relative from an uninvited guest, a neighbor's foreign car from a foreign car owner.  Even if you put a super powerful computer for $ 200 million to filter the interference, it will produce errors, because video processing is based only on contrast.  Distinguish black pants on a black background and understand that they also have a body, which is almost invisible behind a tree, and a bright face against the same background, turned by the nape to the camera, is a person, only one type of mind can do it.  The emergence of artificial intelligence is still late, maybe for a hundred years.  A person solves this problem at a glance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d59/9b6/134/d599b613497d44b493ab0ab59b78b033.jpg"><br>  <i>For a computer, it is a flying object the size of a dog, while standing on its hind legs</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a7/97b/54c/3a797b54cfa44cc5a9ad61a6b891e812.jpg"><br>  <i>For a computer, this is one person, not three</i> <br><br>  <b>Man is a natural danger detector</b> based on the instinct of self-preservation.  Unlike the most powerful computer, the lowest IQ level even of the oldest grandmother allows you to determine with maximum accuracy that the gangsters break into the front door, kill a person or set fire to a house. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cad/0ab/1f8/cad0ab1f80574bdabcb456e7d0a528b6.jpg"><br><br>  Naturally, a person cannot physically look in cameras for a long time in order to use his IQ.  Naturally, each operator tracks thousands of objects at once, due to this the low cost of the service is achieved.  But the question of the human factor is not worth it here, because the Ipikonserzh service has connected living people with the video analytics technology Short Data and its own multi-level control system.  In this type of video surveillance there is no live video at all, no one is watching any cameras.  A person processes already formed events that come to him one after another.  It resembles a conveyor where workers tighten the nuts.  The video came - the operator puts the resolution: ‚Äúcrime‚Äù - ‚Äúno crime‚Äù.  If the resolution is delayed (someone fell asleep), the video event goes to the computer of the pharmacist.  And then even higher.  <b>Thus, inattention, distractibility and thoughtfulness are also killed in the human factor</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a08/ead/04f/a08ead04f38f4ba29455b383cc3af249.jpg"><br><br>  Although, of course, not quite.  To achieve them allows special operator software.  In order to avoid a rash automatic clique, in each resolution the operator describes the nature of the event: a white cat ran, a high neighbor passed, a bird flew by, supposedly a tit.  Note that in each definition there should be a sign: white, high, tit ... It‚Äôs necessary not for the client, but for the operator himself, so that there is a clear awareness of what he saw - as they say in Apikonsjerge - the inclusion of brains. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/031/534/495/0315344954d94afdb33633b118de1849.jpg"><br><br>  And even this is not limited to service Ipikonsierzh.  <b>A special software bot-analyzer checks the comments for their adequacy</b> , consistency with the style, grammar, nature of the activity, repeatability, and so on.  If two cats appear in an hour, or each identical period begins with a cat, or ... - all variants of the unconscious recording are immediately forwarded to the controller - the pharmacist.  Even with a great desire to relax, to fill the first phrases in the head a person must control his process even more in order not to get hooked on the sly bot-analyzers.  Only one violation - and the operator is suspended from work.  And always in the duty shift there is an extra resource person who is ready to take on increasing the load, including at the expense of client problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adb/28c/244/adb28c2443b74cb2b2924eb029eb365f.jpg"><br><br>  Very <b>actively used identifier of persons</b> .  When the task is to determine whether the person opening the door matches the profile of authorized persons, the machine itself determines the level of similarity, but says nothing to the operator.  Only in the case of his apparent error, she gives a loud warning, which is sent to the pharmacist.  Those.  we do not trust computer logic while protecting the client, but only use it to control our employee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/15d/8a8/52115d8a83714b7c978313ac68eaa280.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, it is necessary to add that sometimes it is necessary to switch the human intellect into the mode of full information coverage.  In rare cases, we are faced with controversial situations when something suspicious is seen, but there are no concrete facts of crime.  By clicking on such an event, the entire history of this particular object comes out in the last 24 hours, and the operator has the opportunity to explore his doubts in more detail. <br><br>  For example, it happens that someone runs out of the apartment in a clearly suspicious state and with a big box in his hands, and in the story there is not even such an event that he did not enter the apartment and did not go.  Everything is simple, the owners saved on the camera, putting only one on the entrance platform, and this type climbed through the balcony.  Formally, we do not bear any responsibility, because  in the profile, only the entry control is indicated, but we are all human, and the client‚Äôs happiness is dear to us (the longer he lives, the longer he pays).  In the technology of Short Data there are a number of algorithms that determine the sharp differences from the permanent lifestyle and behavior of the owners.  In these cases, the event history is opened automatically.  And the operator should give an assessment of the reason for such a disclosure, indicating the reason for the occurrence of the indicated detection zones.  If he didn‚Äôt touch them with a mouse, our software signals an inappropriate investigation of the problem.  The operator simply does not have the ability to do their job in bad faith. <br><br>  We also have our own database of apartment thieves.  Yes, it is imperfect, poor quality photos, computer identification is unlikely, but one should not forget that not only computers work with us, but also people.  For any suspicious event, the blacklist pops up in front of the operator.  And, as you have probably guessed, it‚Äôs not just that.  Now the person has the task to point out the most similar person in this photo album. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/859/1cc/b74/8591ccb742b045ffa1a73f8a41828fab.jpg"><br><br>  Unlike traditional video surveillance, our operator solves logical tasks all his shift, this option we call <b>active video surveillance</b> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúShort data‚Äù helps a person in unloading information, and our technologies are designed to kill the human factor.  Perhaps we have not yet taken into account something, so we are waiting for feedback from the communities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369697/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369697/</a></p>
