  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chronicle of the user of the communicator HTC P3300 (Artemis)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the fall of 2006, I decided to purchase PPC, approaching the selection of the device extremely carefully.  I read a large number of reviews, tests and reviews.  At the same time I found out that one new communicator with Bluetooth 2.0+ WiFi (802.11b / g) + GSM / GPRS / EDGE-module 850/900/1800/1900 MHz + GPS-receiver, in November 2006, all observers spoke exclusively OK.  Amazing!  Excellent!  A little bit to Revolutionary!  It was the HTC Artemis. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/fde/04b/55b/fde04b55bc347a244b3ad95112dd4bfa.jpg" width="450" height="318" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The final choice of HTC Artemis (aka P3300) convinced me of the opinion of one of the most respected PC reviewers and various devices in a no less respected computer magazine (at the moment, as far as I know, its Artyomka also fell under the pressure of zyabr).  I‚Äôll immediately make a reservation, I‚Äôm not going to accuse anyone and argue with anyone, I take all the responsibility to acquire and use the device, everything that happened to the device is unique in its kind among the excellent of its fellows (read about them in the <a href="http://www.hpc.ru/">www.)</a> Forums <a href="http://www.hpc.ru/">. Hpc.ru</a> and <a href="http://www.4pda.ru/">www.4pda.ru</a> ).  Just because I was not lucky, - the story, however, seems instructive. <br>  So, <br><br>  12/04/06.  Ordered HTC Artemis at <a href="http://www.superetrader.co.uk/">www.superetrader.co.uk</a> .  The device arrived on 07.12.06.  Unpacked, liked.  When shaking inside the HTC something slightly rumbled, - a trifle, but nice;). <br>  It is impossible to say that I immediately rushed to install many programs in the communicator.  At first I decided to get acquainted with Windows Mobile 5.0, twist and test. <br><br>  12/13/06.  The screen goes blank.  I did not react to anything, either to power on / off, or to Soft Reset.  Re-earned only when connected to a PC.

      12/14/06.  Missing Bluetooth connection.  Also, CommManager does not start.  When you try to start a Bluetooth setup, nothing happens.  The problem was solved only by Hard Reset.  I decided that this is not Artemis glitches, but WM5.0.  Before installing new programs and filling in contacts, tasks and events in the P3300, I began to think for a long time - do I need it if it still goes to digital eternity with the new Hard Reset? <br><br>  12/18/06.  Stopped turning on the power button with the screen.  It is that screen, the programs with the screen gone out are started (found out by typing).  Found that the screen turns on the camera button.  Strange, isn't it?  The problem was solved by reducing the backlight from the maximum to the second stick, in this state the screen began to turn on and off normally. <br><br>  12/21/06.  Turned on HTC P3300 in the morning.  The alarm went off.  In addition to the alarm, nothing worked - no buttons were pressed, no hardware or software shortcuts, only the alarm and that's all.  Yeah, the shutdown button worked.  After turning off and on, the alarm sounded again.  Once again I had to do a Soft Reset.  After Soft Reset, the file structure of the memory card (SanDisk 1Gb) for the first time was broken.  The files are not readable, their names were displayed incorrectly - what appeared in the forums began to be called "krakozyabry." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e90/706/890/e90706890584c44a01b37b4628043823.jpg" width="391" height="263" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  I had to format the memory card.  The second time I lost all the information in the communicator.  I understood that working on such a device is not possible. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/bdc/d32/4a7/bdcd324a711c4715ca33f8b5c38b1675.jpg" width="240" height="320" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  12/21/06.  When connected to a laptop screen gus.  Absolutely quenched, impossible to see anything.  When connected to an external power source - the same.  Got into settings.  Found that the backlight indicator when connecting an external power source - at a minimum.  Who put it on the minimum?  I did not set.  Raised to the maximum, then again to the minimum.  Hooked up.  At the minimum - the picture is!  That is, the screen is ABSOLUTELY quenched before - and the reason for this is not a minimum of illumination at all, but an iron glitch!  I decided to start pulling <a href="http://www.superetrader.co.uk/">www.superetrader.co.uk</a> .  I sent a letter and received the following reply: ‚ÄúWhat are the problems that you are experiencing with your unit?  There have been a number of these units.  Please note the goods of the goods.  I decided to observe and form a detailed list of all the problems. <br><br>  At Christmas, Artemis began to make me happy.  I already thought that we finally became friends.  Soft Reset had to be done quite often, but as I understand it, this is a common problem with Windows Mobile 5.0 devices (here I would like to convey a huge hello to Microsoft and say that despite all the ‚Äúbut‚Äù most buggy products they have, people-to-people) are used to.  Sometimes it happened just when the device was turned on, when the screen did not respond to pressing, it happened even when performing simple operations (editing the address book, for example).  I love and often use SPB Brain Evolution - Artemis sometimes freezes tightly after exiting the program. <br>  It is also annoying that the HTC P3300 is VERY slow when using GPS.  I don‚Äôt know how to use TomTom and at what speed you have to drive, if while driving 60 km / h the picture is drawn with FPS 0.5 frames per second.  I saw how TomTom works on a TomTom device, the triangle on the map moves smoothly, corresponding to every turn.  On the P3300, it jumps from place to place over fairly long distances.  Thus, it becomes possible to skip the exit from the junction or turn. <br>  Do not count, do not understand where the scratch appeared on the body.  After that, Artemis was wearing a case, he became even more beautiful. <br><br>  New problems came in the spring, when I decided to compensate for the lack of space on the microSD card and bought a new, 2 Gb SanDisk MicroSd card instead of 1 Gb.  The contents of the old card were thrown onto a PC hard disk and then copied to a new card.  Everything worked great. <br>  After 2 days krakozyabry returned.  Formatted the card, again copied the contents of the old card. <br><br>  03/18/07.  I wanted to use GPS.  Instead, I saw a bunch of junk on the map.  He came home, danced with a tambourine around, including 7-10 soft sets in various poses.  Did not help.  Then, on the advice of one of the members of the forum, he used PC Windows to check the memory card for errors while at the same time correcting them.  It helped, but not to say completely, in particular the Books, mp3 and Video folders were irretrievably gone. <br><br>  03/19/07  I wrote a letter about Zyabr on HTC Europe and to the office where I purchased the device.  From HTC I received the following reply: Thanks for your email regarding your P3300.  You are aware of and are currently in the process of rectifying.  It seems that it has also been a great help for solving this.  It seems to be the state of the device. <br>  If you‚Äôre not in the past, you‚Äôre still investigating. of pressing the power button. <br>  Once you have fixed the problem, it has been fixed. <br>  Thank you for your patience in this matter. <br>  Please do not hesitate to call us. <br><br>  They say that this means that the bot that responds to the letters is now aware that another Artemis user is not well.  I hope this will make someone a little better. <br><br>  In 2007, HTC is going to release more than ten new models of communicators.  Glad for them.  Similarly, I am no longer their user. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5523/</a></p>
