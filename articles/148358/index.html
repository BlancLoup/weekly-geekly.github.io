It seems that today it will not work.  The client is not shy in expressions, puts pressure on the feeling of guilt.  Terribly embarrassing.  From long sitting behind a computer eyes hurt.  From the need to debug and rake someone else's govnokod - back.  If your back hurts, then most likely you should be doing the work you hate right now.  In my head - despair, anger.  And hammering the thought: <br><br>  <b>I</b> <b><br></b>  <b>I do not want</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Responsible for others shoals</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was 2004. I opened the studio about a year ago, and the only thing I really wanted to do was to program.  I did not want to be engaged in accounting, personnel, business activities, clients, negotiations.  I just wanted to write code.  Something <a href="http://xn-----clcksaplxf6byd3cyb.xn--p1ai/">like these guys</a> . 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

        </script>
      <br>
      Over time, something has changed.  No, I still want to write code.  But, for example, I realized that these were not <b>foreign shoals</b> .  And what exactly I, as the director, ultimately answer for them.  For hiring these people (it is them) and for agreeing to work with these clients.  For the fact that this is how the tasks were distributed, and this is how the workflow was set.  Yes for everything, in short. <br><br>  Now it will be necessary to turn on the imagination: I will try to explain at what point the "responsibility" is included. <br><br>  Here you sit, calmly go about your business (write code, for example).  And a colleague from the neighboring department comes to you with a problem.  You can advise something to him.  Or you can send it to hell (you have to do your work).  In the end, everyone has shitty days. <br><br>  But at that moment, as you delve into his problem and take it upon yourself, a <i>‚Äúchpok‚Äù</i> is heard - and now this is your problem.  Now to solve it is a matter of technique.  But until the <i>‚Äúchpok‚Äù has</i> been heard, you will treat the problem as someone else‚Äôs, and you will hardly be sincere to solve it.  By and large - without this <i>"pip"</i> you do not care if the problem will be solved: it will be <b>someone else's problem</b> .  (By the way, a <a href="http://hbr-russia.ru/issue/1/1196/">monkey sits</a> on your back with the sound of <i>‚Äúchpok‚Äù</i> , if you know what I am talking about). <br><br>  You can, of course, write a lot of clever words about delegation, etc., but this will not change two facts: <br><ul><li>  Your employees will still carry you their problems; </li><li>  If they suddenly don‚Äôt have their problems for you, then they have big problems. </li></ul><br>  When viewed from the side, it is often seen that a person rested or digs in the wrong place.  And he himself still does not understand that he rested.  We need to come up and push, offer a workaround, decide something for him.  But before you go - it is necessary that there is a <i>‚Äúchpok‚Äù</i> and you accept responsibility for solving the problem. <br><br>  On good, responsibility should be delegated, along with the appropriate authority. <br><br>  Well, for example, who should be responsible for: <br><ul><li>  deadlines </li><li>  quality, </li><li>  budget, </li><li>  customer satisfaction on a particular project?  Obviously, the project manager!  (all obvious?) </li></ul><br>  Okay.  Then the question arises: what in practical terms does it mean to ‚Äúbear responsibility‚Äù? <br>  What responsibility can there be? <br><br>  I remembered offhand: <br><br><ul><li>  Criminal </li><li>  Administrative. </li><li>  Physical (I mean corporal punishment for wrongdoing; slavery there ...). </li><li>  Religious (anathema there, for example). </li><li>  Moral (ooo! This is something like "religious"). </li><li>  Material (fines, for example). </li></ul><br>  Something else can, but so far it does not occur to the head. <br><br>  However, which of these ‚Äúresponsibilities‚Äù can be put into practice in the daily work of the studio?  Not exactly criminal and administrative.  Perhaps I would not use physical too often :-D.  We somehow immediately neglected the religious cult. <br><br>  <b>The closest analogue is moral responsibility.</b>  This is the type when you prokosyachil, and you - reprimand.  A kind of "punishment without punishment."  In practice, this translates into that: <br><br><ul><li>  You are loaded; </li><li>  Yelling at you; </li><li>  You load yourself; </li><li>  And all this at the same time. </li></ul><br>  Watching my one and a half year old son, I noticed that he starts screaming and crying when: <br><br><ul><li>  something goes wrong, as he would like to; </li><li>  it hurts him physically. </li></ul><br>  This behavior seems to be almost natural: if there was a facac on the project - you need to find the culprit and very emotionally explain to him where he, the bitch, is wrong.  This action removes the pain of the head, which he feels almost physically when something goes wrong on the project. <br><br>  Despite the prevalence of the method (and the alternatives are not enough), its frequent use leads to a difficult moral situation in the team, and what the subordinates consider the manager to be a complete asshole.  (And you need it?). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80f/dd0/8c0/80fdd08c0e9704e5e671b1b659290fc2.png"><br><br>  <b>But there is a financial responsibility.</b>  Perfectly!  But in most cases the fact is a farce.  Well, it does not work properly.  Few (extremely few) of the hired personnel are responsible for the implementation of the objectives of the project.  In the worst case, the prize will be insufficient or fired. <br><br>  Imagine for a moment that you are a project manager for the development of a U-Mobile.  Like, make cool, get a lot of money.  If you don't, you won't.  And now the project has been launched, they have given you money.  You calmly go to another company and ... <br><br>  It turns out that there is a defect in the project, due to which you need to recall the entire series.  Who is now financially responsible?  Well, not exactly a manager - with him everything was fine. <br><br>  Ok, in the construction industry in contracts, some real sanctions are prescribed, according to which you can really try financially or criminally to punish the guilty even after 30 years.  It is clear that in fact it turns into a farce and search for a scapegoat. <br><br>  The farce is as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  Feeling a close fakap, top management can quickly quit, leaving behind a "legacy" that falls on the head of another poor fellow (while walking and telling how everything was fine with him). </li><li>  If you take into account not only managers, but also employees of creative professions (designers, programmers), then it is still more difficult with them.  Material liability demotivates them. </li></ul><br>  But this is a separate big topic about KPI, which should be considered in the same separate, large and terrible article. <br><br>  <b>Instead of output:</b> <br>  <i>I do not want to settle for others</i> <i><br></i>  <i>but it is my responsibility</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I hired these people</i> <i><br></i>  <i>How does responsibility arise?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>you have a problem and - chpok!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>she is yours</i> <i><br></i>  <i>in a good way the manager should be responsible</i> <i><br></i>  <i>but what is it like?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>moral - get reprimanded</i> <i><br></i>  <i>works?</i>  <i>Yes!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>material - applicable?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>no, she is constantly avoided and delegated to the leadership</i> <i><br></i>  <i>if anyone is able to give guarantees, it‚Äôs the business owner himself</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148358/</a></p>
