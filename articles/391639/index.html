  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top 10 torrent trackers over the hill</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Below is a list of the most visited torrent sites for 2016.  In early 2016, KickassTorrents was in the lead, followed by The Pirate Bay torrent tracker.  Much has happened lately, some torrent sites have disappeared, others have taken their place "under the sun." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77a/483/297/77a483297f0046e08d6597d85b1993f8.png"><br><br>  Users of course get used to this or that site, but in case of its disappearance / blocking, they gladly, without disdain, jump over to others.  This trend is also traced according to the data of the new list of top torrents.  The first positions are held by well-known old players, but a couple of torrent newbies also appeared.  After 10 years of work, the popular torrent resource EZTV was closed in May last year. <a name="habracut"></a>  Back in early spring 2015, EZTV lost its domain name due to incorrect information in the Whois section.  The domain name eztv.it was put up for sale, the scammers immediately successfully bought it.  Therefore, we note this torrent resource as newly minted.

YTS / YIFY is a well-known release group and a popular torrent resource, appeared on the market in 2010, at first the release group uploaded torrents to PublicHD, KickassTorrents, 1337x, The Pirate Bay and ExtraTorrent.  The first release of the group was the DVD-rip cartoon "Toy Story" (1, 2 part).  The year the group worked on reputation, after which it launched its website YTS.  YIFY used to be called the unsinkable submarine.  Starting in 2012, he confidently gained search traffic.  In October 2015, without explanation or reason, he went to the offline site YTS, behind which stood the well-known release group YIFY.  MPAA (American Cinema Rating System) reached the YIFI YTS group, went out to its operator, who lived in New Zealand, was threatened with a multi-million claim before it, if it does not cooperate with MPAA.  And so, it only cost the site to "sink into oblivion," as the unofficial site YTS.ag immediately rebelled, which in a couple of months had already managed to build a user base. <br><br>  Apparently, the majority of users of torrent resources are happy as long as they can get what they want, no matter what source they distribute the most desired) <br><br>  KickassTorrents (CAT) remains the most visited torrent resource and continues to grow.  The Pirate Bay came in second place, despite the suspension of work for two months, during which the annual turnover was lost.  Of course, Rutracker would make some torrents by the number of visitors ... but, the authors of the article decided to make only representatives of the anglonet in the top. <br><br>  Below is a complete list of the top 10 most visited torrent sites at the beginning of the new 2016.  Some sites will be rated according to the Alexa Rank rating system.  The system itself is based on counting the total number of page views and the frequency of visits to a particular resource.  The Alexa Rank is the ratio of the attendance of one resource and the attendance of other Internet portals; therefore, the lower the Alexa Rank number, the more popular the resource. <br><br>  1. <a href="https://kat.cr/">KICKASSTORRENTS</a> - ALEXA RANK: 85 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/006/afa/58f/006afa58f2a5409d8640f816ef263431.png"><br><br>  The resource appeared in 2009 and last year surpassed The Pirate Bay in traffic.  Recently, often jumped from one domain zone to another.  In 2014 he moved to the Somali kickass.so, and on February 9 last year was banned on Whois, the site stayed unavailable for the day, and then returned to life again, but with the old address kickass.to.  For the history of its existence, there were not a few complaints, then about the plagiarism of the design, then about copyright infringement, was excluded from Google search (MPAA tried).  Recently, the domain name in the domain name was changed to Costa Rican.cr, the largest tracker. <br><br>  2. THE PIRATE BAY <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/033/e27/9a0/033e279a06304536bab20eae806df009.png"><br><br>  The main "icon" of piracy.  Appeared on the world stage back in 2003.  On December 9, 2014, The Pirate Bay servers were hit by the Swedish police, but the exact location of the arrest of the servers is still not known (somewhere in Stockholm), since apparently the operation was partially classified.  The site went offline, but not for long: several unofficial mirrors of The Pirate Bay (oldpiratebay.org) opened on the Internet.  THE PIRATE BAY is available again to everyone, this time with the Costa Rican domain address - thepiratebay.cr <br><br>  3. <a href="http://extratorrent.cc/">EXTRATORRENT</a> - ALEXA RANK: 342 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f50/897/226/f5089722647344d492e35d0360c103f8.png"><br><br>  Continues to gain traffic and has become an active torrent community.  The site has become the "home" of the famous release groups ETTV and ETRG. <br><br>  4. <a href="http:">TORRENTZ</a> - ALEXA RANK: 351 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edb/4ed/2cc/edb4ed2cc77a4ca697c67fab0f953c75.png"><br><br>  Torrentz is a search service that searches torrents for your search on other trackers.  The search results include all the largest trackers.  The site uses several domain names, the most popular is .eu. <br><br>  5. <a href="http://rarbg.to/index8.php">RARBG</a> - ALEXA RANK: 1,101 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c73/b72/f83/c73b72f8366f44edbb8ca314f27a581b.png"><br><br>  Big Bulgarian torrent tracker.  The site was blocked by British Internet service providers last year.  March 27, 2015 was blocked in Denmark, later in October in Portugal. <br><br>  6. <a href="http://1337x.to/">1337X</a> - ALEXA RANK: 1.249 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d9/11e/1eb/9d911e1ebd374888aeb914be006ec217.png"><br><br>  So to say "public" torren-tracker.  According to the owners, it was launched ‚Äúto fill the obvious void in the absence of high-quality torrent sites without ads with public trackers.‚Äù  Works at domain address 1337x.to <br><br>  7. EZTV.AG - ALEXA RANK: 1.373 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d97/11c/42e/d9711c42e5864ed28b10bf7393d679b7.png"><br><br>  EZTV was founded in 2005 and has become one of the most popular torrent trackers on the planet, in which users mostly shared TV shows.  It was closed earlier this year, the serial torrent tracker EZTV was in the hands of intruders. <br><br>  The new ‚Äúowners‚Äù of EZTV continue to operate in the normal mode of service, using the fraudulently acquired by their popular brand.  The Pirate Bay, KickassTorrents and Rarbg by the way eliminated EZTV accounts, while other torrents hung up a warning that the scammers took over the site. <br><br>  8. <a href="http://www.torrenthound.com/">TORRENTHOUND</a> - ALEXA RANK: 2.239 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a97/c6c/cc7/a97c6ccc79944353b7e1fa5a1c06f4a5.png"><br><br>  TorrentHound has been around for almost 10 years, but hasn't hit the top 10 yet.  He received complaints of copyright infringement and was blocked in some countries ( <a href="http://bloka.net/torrenthound.com/">how to bypass the blocking</a> ). <br><br>  9. <a href="https://yts.ag/">YTS.AG</a> - ALEXA RANK: 740 <br><br>  YTS.ag has nothing to do with the original YTS or release by the YIFY group, but seeks to take its place under the sun.  As with the new EZTV, several large torrent sites have eliminated their YIFY or YTS accounts, warning of fraud. <br><br>  10. <a href="http://www.torrentdownloads.me/">TORRENTDOWNLOADS</a> - ALEXA RANK: 2,969 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7f/0ab/ed4/d7f0abed4f3248a485344dc067b9f194.png"><br><br>  This year, hit the top 10, the last time hit the top ten in 2011. <br><br>  It is clear that the Alexa Rank website rating system is not perfect and has many flaws, but we have such a rating at the beginning of 2016. <br><br>  [ <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-popular-torrent-sites-of-2016-160102/">source</a> ] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391639/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391639/</a></p>
