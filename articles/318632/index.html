      <i>Steam punk seems to be about applied science, but when you look closely - magic, pure magic!</i> <br><br>  Ahead was the content management department, and the quantum annihilator and the old one, but with a good timbre in the BMW style, a chainsaw, remained from the tools for popularizing new efficient algorithms.  Having chosen a proven combat friend, the analyst knocked quietly on the content department door, guiltily entered and asked: ‚ÄúYou continue to buy on amazon and aliexpress - Aha!‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou continue persistently not to use personalization in the online store catalog, not to believe in its effectiveness and not to use AB-testing - Well, of course, all the same, something is for sale! ‚Äù.  ‚ÄúMay the force be with us‚Äù - this is the last thing that was heard from the mouth of a forest nurse, until he managed to drown out the sound of a running motor ... <br><br>  From the means of implementation, there was still a secret drawer under the table and ... the development department.  It was for him that the secret weapon was intended, which by efficiency exceeded the quantum annihilator that had seen a lot on the galactic boundaries ... There was enough good beer in the box for everyone and with a reserve, and the cookies relished when discussing with the dear brothers in arms the subtleties of <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> overclocking on production.  Day - a success! <br><br>  ‚ÄúA data syntacist is coming to you for an interview‚Äù - the subductor of multidimensional spaces who snarled on the couch at lunchtime heard ... and woke up.  What a strange dream, why would it?  Oh yeah, we are introducing neural networks in the online store - to work! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/370/7e6/508/3707e650804445258b38da368edaf249.gif"></div><br>  <i>‚ÄúWhat a strange dream I had a dream,‚Äù thought Alice and ran home so as not to be late for tea.</i> <br><br>  What is it for me?  ) The problem of fasting is simple - how to make an online store bring more profits at low cost to the latest technology of machine learning.  And how to convince the store owner and employees to use them!  (and the hand reaches for the weapon again) <br><br><h3>  Software is close and available as never before </h3><br>  On the one hand, now, more than ever, <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/">available and ready for rapid prototyping</a> and, in principle, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">implementation</a> - the basic, bearded, mustached, and lively machine learning methods that can make an online store business more profitable. <br><br>  Love extreme pleasures - yes, please, ‚Äúpip install‚Äù and, while a cup of coffee is being poured, everything has been installed on the analyst's laptop that will allow <a href="https://keras.io/">to raise the neuron</a> and train on a small amount of data.  Get results a few percent better. <br><br>  If you are sure that the model will be useful to you, and there is a lot of data expected - you can spend a little more time in a more verbose language and get a close result with a greater guarantee of fast <a href="https://deeplearning4j.org/">production</a> . <br><br>  In general, with technology now everything is very accessible and you can not think too much - take it ready with support for tensors and GPUs, run analytics on a laptop which thread is ready to crap in python, customize ssh proxying and implement a service for clients. <br><br><h3>  Algorithms for the online store, which are likely to increase its profits </h3><br>  Here, too, everything is rosy and accessible.  Let's go through each. <br><br><h4>  Personal recommendations </h4><br>  If the data is relatively small - take the ready <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-collaborative-filtering.html">matrix compressor on Spark</a> and you're done.  If there is quite a lot of data, <a href="https://mahout.apache.org/users/recommender/recommender-documentation.html">you can shove their memory</a> and drive classic collaborative filtering. <br>  From fresh and tasty, and there is a budget for a cluster with a GPU - you can try to prepare <a href="https://github.com/amznlabs/amazon-dsstne">Amazon DSSTNE</a> .  Here colleagues teach the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder">denoising autoencoder</a> - which ‚Äúrestores‚Äù the client‚Äôs personal recommendations.  The model is wide-flat, but the matrices are multiplying in chunks on different kernels / machines and in C ++, leaving <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorSLOW</a> far behind. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71c/c5f/0d5/71cc5f0d5b7342258b67d615bdfe0e23.png"></div><br>  <i>Amazon DSSTNE receives from the sooo long vector of the User‚Äôs Products a significantly shorter <a href="https://www.quora.com/Deep-Learning-What-is-meant-by-a-distributed-representation">distributed representation</a> (set of categories / subcategories of the Goods), which is then compressed into a ‚Äúfull‚Äù vector of recommendations of the Goods to the User</i> <br><br>  For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system">content-based recommendations,</a> you can first use a ready-made <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/">search engine</a> , and then look towards the ‚Äúsemantic vectors‚Äù of words and phrases ‚Äî starting with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">Word2Vec</a> or <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/">GloVe</a> . <br><br><h4>  Advanced search engine </h4><br>  Here you can often improve the classical search algorithm using <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/314222/">semantic ranking</a> .  Just do not try to repeat the experiment of Yandex with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jfgao/paper/2013/cikm2013_dssm_fullversion.pdf">DSSM</a> in the forehead - look at the input dimension of their neural network and calculate how much and what iron you will need for this space flight. <br><br><h4>  Chatbot </h4><br>  To teach a chatbot to answer questions you need ... a lot of work with your head and hands.  The easiest way to do this is on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.L.I.C.E.">regular</a> tests and first-order predicates stored in MySQL.  You can also make molds with the parameters <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/lex/">in the style of booking plane tickets in the United States</a> .  And in response to the popular question ‚Äúhow to make a chatbot on a neural network‚Äù - in response, I want to laugh hysterically, tear out leaves from a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Speech-Language-Processing-Daniel-Jurafsky/dp/0131873210/ref%3Dzg_bs_271581011_10%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26psc%3D1%26refRID%3DMDPG1A4B81NA1FFRM25P">well-known little book by a</a> famous <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/">professor</a> , glue roll-ups and release eights on my side (the symbol of infinity) in the questioner's face. <br><br><h4>  Automation technical support </h4><br>  Here is also a <a href="http://www.wildml.com/2016/07/deep-learning-for-chatbots-2-retrieval-based-model-tensorflow/">finished story</a> with well-known implementations.  There are two problems: we need a large corpus of dialogues in the shop‚Äôs language (and for Russian, the situation with the corps is <a href="http://ruscorpora.ru/">deplorable for the time</a> ) and irrelevant answers will get to Recall @ 5 if a new question has arrived (yes, yes, that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization_error">generalization</a> ), since  neural networks, for the time being, basically help, only occasionally doing work better than a person (and for that you need to be <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition/">killed</a> while training them). <br><br><h4>  Next Best Offer </h4><br>  Here you can track the internal cycles of the online store Buyer and at key points offer something to buy.  For example, to lead the loyalty cycle of each customer.  It is a lot of algorithms, from bearded Markov models to modern and effective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory">recurrent cells</a> . <br><br><h4>  Customer clustering </h4><br>  Here, too, everything is ready for a long time and <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/unsupervised_learning.html">easy to deploy in minutes</a> .  You can identify target groups of customers and bomb them with personal recommendations! <br><br>  In our product, we have implemented a part of these algorithms so far: content-based recommendations and collaborative filtering.  Well, so that was where to start ... the battle. <br><br><h3>  And how to prove that the algorithms work? </h3><br>  Here it becomes more interesting. <br><br><ul><li>  Here in your online store appeared <s>in</s> smart- <s>in</s> smart pythonists-dataseintists-analysts ... </li><li>  Here you have raised the basic models of the above popular algorithms on their working laptops ... </li><li>  So you started offering clients personal recommendations and making emails in clusters and offering goods to customers at times when they are ‚Äúhard to refuse‚Äù ... </li></ul><br>  And ... and come! <br><br>  Proving what has become better and the resources allocated to <s>the</s> smart guys, a lot of clever words and even more incomprehensible pictures in matplotlib pay off - it turns out to be difficult, very difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c75/15a/b32/c7515ab32a94487bb5cb1a8b55ba2bc5.PNG"><br>  <i>Scary and incomprehensible pictures on analysts' laptops</i> <br><br>  Much and much regret, intelligent articles and techniques on the topic "how to prove that personal recommendations work" are orders of magnitude less orders of magnitude than fascinating articles on the topic of <a href="">GAN</a> or on the generation of pornographic images using deep neurons.  And when you read about what <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/04/netflix-recommendations-beyond-5-stars.html">NetFlix</a> writes about, how colleagues use crude empirics, sincere faith and a voodoo spell to measure and <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm%3Fid%3D2843948">improve their recommender system</a> - it becomes very fun (you must read the articles, if you don‚Äôt read, there‚Äôs real experience ). <br><br>  In fact, it all comes down to ‚Äúfaith‚Äù and intensive and continuous AB testing, in which some customers pass by trained models, and some through machine learning algorithms. <br><br><h3>  Constant feedback is required. </h3><br>  We see that the intensity of content personalization is constantly increasing.  Through our smartphones, the giants of the industry are intensively watching us and, apparently, but not provable, they are confident that the personalization of content - increases their profits and the costs of smart data-analytics analysts and GPU - are justified. <br><br>  Known to us giants live with advertising.  The more targeted it is, the greater their profit.  That is why, it seems to me, they and not only they, but rather all the well-known IT-companies are more and more investing in data analysis and the use of machine learning algorithms to promote their products. <br><br>  Requirements of continuous control over the effectiveness of content personalization for Clients with and without machine learning and, banal, monitoring the quality of work of trained models on real data is another project, more likely even larger in terms of resources and resources for implementation than the use of ready-made researched and laid out in open access algorithms and frameworks. <br><br>  That's not all.  Comparison of the work of algorithms, which, as you know, can take and stop working (better than they were before) - requires constant measurement of conversion and AB-testing in all structural divisions: from the marketing department to the customer service department.  Otherwise, you will get a beautiful, modern, expensive (especially if you take up neural networks with a GPU) and a senseless toy and a set of gurus in a team who speak an incomprehensible language. <br><br><h3>  Findings.  How to start online shopping jump into the outgoing train? </h3><br><ol><li>  I hope it became clear that the major players in the market have long considered the growth of profits from the use of machine learning to personalize content, actively develop this area, hire the best minds and exploit the best hardware (GPU).  Information on the topic of efficiency in the public domain - the day with the fire can not be found.  But judging by the reports at conferences, 1-2 models from roughly 10 take off and allow not only increasing the conversion, but also getting around the competition - becoming closer to the Customers. <br><br></li><li>  Until you start to measure conversions transparently and systematically, personalization using machine learning will most likely not help you and will even complicate business processes. <br><br></li><li>  After creating clear and consistent conversion metrics, learn to conduct systemic AB-testing of online store changes made manually (the main page design was changed, the order wizard logic). <br><br></li><li>  If your goal is to bring the marketing department to the next cosmic speed, then follow how the work with clients' email addresses is going on: in echos or in mind and other data.  If the process can be automated - do it.  Then try to do the segmentation with the help of machine clustering, make a test mailing and with the help of AB testing make sure in the result. <br><br></li><li>  If your goal is to bring the customer service department to the orbit of Mars, likewise, make sure that the customer list is not in the exelcel or correspondence.  Minimum - it should be in CRM.  Then, using primitive techniques (Bayes classifier, logistic regression), try, with AB testing enabled, to start working with churn groups and attractive Clients using CLV analysis.  Think carefully, involve <s>in</s> smart analysts - how to make sure that the implemented models have improved the conversion and relevance of the offers to Clients.  It can be much more difficult - than everything taken together and done earlier :-) Secret: the conversion will be much higher, but the Nobel Prize application will prove it to Australopithecus. <br><br></li><li>  After obtaining a sustainable result and building up basic processes in the structural units of the online store, you can think about increasing the quality of algorithms using neural networks or attracting more valuable analysts from datasentists. </li></ol><br>  Remember that you can only improve what you can measure! <br><br><h3>  And if you do otherwise? </h3><br>  People, unfortunately, most do not like to change.  Who will improve something by 5%, if it works anyway and has worked 20 years before that and ‚Äúeveryone is doing it‚Äù.  Understandably, by proposing in the accounting department to carry out a ‚ÄúFisher discriminant analysis‚Äù the maximum that you can achieve is to increase the production of hormones among the most active women who love smart men.  But mostly - you will be hate quietly :-) The only employee who most likely will not give up the extra 5% conversion and profits is the head of the sales department, but to prove to him that the content personalized using machine learning works is impossible <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25A1%25D0%2594">of drugs</a> .  Only AB-testing in the form of a pink cat and a green puppy can persuade 20 years of people selling without AI.  They say that sometimes white-painted girls with Fizmata help, reasoning about the charms of accurate measurements of everything and always - but it is very difficult to find these goddesses, many more goddesses who understand social networks better than their own brain. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f55/0f3/234/f550f32341a54223b1bbd0ef7a3a2dcd.jpg"></div><br>  <i>There is a small chance that hard drugs will help convince the sales team to use personalized content.</i> <br><br><h3>  Results </h3><br>  In general, colleagues working for 100% of the recipe to introduce new technologies for personalization and predictive marketing in the online store - no.  Sometimes <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_(%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5)">decimation</a> will help.  Sometimes - the realization of waking sleep from the beginning of the post.  But it is better, of course, to act with patience and love - if a budget is allocated for them :-) From experience - you need help and support from above and a clearly defined goal: to increase the conversion and constantly measure and measure it.  Loosen your grip - stay with an expensive toy and a bunch of new unknown words.  Good luck to everyone and with the upcoming - we wish more continuous ABCDE testing in the new year! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18e/04c/220/18e04c220832477cad2e31a4da09dfaa.jpg"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318632/</a></p>
