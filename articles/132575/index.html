  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Eventez</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now many startups are based on very simple ideas.  The more concise, the easier it is to try and make sure ‚Äúthe fan or not the fan‚Äù.  For example: they assumed that people were fed up with extensive writing on blogs and they would be very pleased to exchange short public <nobr>status messages</nobr> - they created twitter;  or, it was thought that extreme discounts would provoke the same extreme demand for goods and services (moreover, even unfamiliar and exotic) - received by Groupon;  or, they noticed that people are not afraid to advertise their places of residence, added elements of "game mechanics" - got Foursquare ... <br><br>  Following the principle of simple ideas, and the advice of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/130938/">minimizing the functional (MVP)</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/130761/">bootstrapping</a> <b>, <a href="http://eventez.ru/">Eventez</a> appeared</b> . <br><br>  The idea is simple: <i>people are interested in events (events) that occur around them</i> .

People are interested in events (events) that occur around them."><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Events are concerts, exhibitions, <nobr>lectures, seminars, trainings</nobr> , promotions, discounts, children's matinees, collective bike rides, birthday celebrations of friends and everything else ... The main sign of the event is that they tend to start and end in the foreseeable period of time.  To know that there is a concert hall and a pub nearby is certainly useful ... but information about what will happen there is even more interesting.  The main difference between Eventez events and points in Foursquare and AlterGeo is that the events self-destruct and do not litter the air (like, for example, <nobr>4sq-points</nobr> ‚ÄúCork on the Enthusiasts <nobr>Highway</nobr> ‚Äù, ‚ÄúKolyan wants a beer‚Äù and ‚ÄúSession with Lily‚Äù). <br><br>  Now, in accordance with MVP, Evetez has a minimum of functionality implemented.  Approximately 10% of the plan: <br><ul><li>  We collect <nobr>event events</nobr> from various services using an open API or parsim. </li><li>  All this is sorted, conceptualized and put in the database. </li><li>  We do geo-referencing (via Google, at). </li><li>  We filter in accordance with the preferences and location of the client. </li><li>  Display the list on the map. </li></ul><br>  So far, information about events is collected from three sources: Concert.ru (concerts, clubs, performances and other shows and festivals), timepad.ru (lectures, seminars, trainings) and weclever.ru (coupons, discounts).  Sources define the geography of events and the "horizon in time."  If <nobr>eventez</nobr> tells you where you are and the ‚Äútime horizon‚Äù of your interests, it‚Äôs not hard to show what you need. <br><br>  Actually, the more sources and APIs that transmit events at the entrance, the more so even at the exit.  We tried to connect events from Last.fm (the whole world is represented there), but there was a problem of ‚Äúduplication‚Äù of events.  From different sources come the same events, but with different <nobr>names, descriptions,</nobr> and even in different languages ‚Äã‚Äã... how to identify and ‚Äúglue‚Äù them is not clear. <br><br>  Although it is useful to follow the principle of minimizing the functionality, it is obvious that it is not easy to see events on the map.  It is necessary to identify interesting events for each specific user.  To this end, eventez has a simple ‚Äúcollaborationist thinker‚Äù built into it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00f/4d2/2db/00f4d22dbddeecdd11aedff141659e9d.gif" alt="Eventez: a collaborator's thinking algorithm"><br><br>  Noting which events are interesting and which are not, users will gradually train the ‚Äúthinker‚Äù to guess their preferences, find people with similar tastes (in the future) and give out only interesting things. <br>  &lt;p?  In order for eventez to recognize the user (and remember his interests and location), it is necessary to log in.  Registration is not required.  You can use GoogleID, Facebook, VKontakte and other Odnoklassniki ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fa/ec4/e67/3faec4e6740784d8b5c0c889f6cbbede.gif" alt="Eventez - do not forget to log in. There will be useful things for you and those around you."><br><br>  It took two months and a half to digger on all developments.  We will look at how interesting the prototype is. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://eventez.ru/">Use and share your impressions.</a></b>  <b><a href="http://eventez.ru/">http://eventez.ru</a></b> <br><br>  <i><b>PS</b></i> <br>  Background and roadmap: Initially, it was the all4geo project ( <a href="http://all4geo.com/">http://all4geo.com</a> ).  In the b2b model (control of the work of remote employees, couriers and managers "in the fields", and their interaction with the office) all4geo is completely commercialized.  But for ordinary consumers, communication in <nobr>geo-related</nobr> groups turned out to be not interesting.  For b2c, they decided to move towards simplifying interfaces, add support for trackers, disable the ability to communicate and create groups (each individual, the group itself).  But <a href="http://wellstart.ru/blog/post/rakes-and-forks-a-special-case">with the support of the trackers there was a hitch</a> .  Forced downtime was filled with eventez prototype creation.  After the run-in, it is planned to transfer the functions of geo-related communication, automatic creation of groups around events (messaging in the context of the event), creation of mobile applications and add-ons to social networks, integration of communication mechanisms with social networks and other services, landing ‚Äúnano-anthology information‚Äù ( iii.ru) inside events as zamanuhi and / or entertaining and <nobr>many, many, many</nobr> things.  But it is in the future.  In the meantime, eventez will live its own life, and we will look and analyze how and what the people do in it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132575/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132575/</a></p>
