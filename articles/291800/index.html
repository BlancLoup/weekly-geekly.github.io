      Now let's go through each item and understand what is important to describe in each of them. <br><br><h4>  We describe each of the 7 entities </h4><br><h5>  Products </h5><br>  It is important to understand that the products are described for customers.  For those who use them.  Because the main thing that needs to be described here is its value and how to get the product.  In the simplest version, this can be a description of the service and a button on the application. <br><br>  In a more complex version, it can be a whole procedure for receiving a service or product.  With the section of frequent questions and product documentation. <br><br>  A perfect example of a grocery catalog: these are various online stores, a communication service site such as Megafon or a portal of public services. <br><br>  We have a separate page in the company, which is called ‚ÄúServices‚Äù and there is a set of core products that employees need to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f3c/f38/c6f/f3cf38c6f4b5e6bf920cbe51507bec54.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you need order in the company, then this product catalog has a weighty value and allows you to significantly simplify the interaction between departments and employees. <br><br><h5>  Divisions </h5><br>  In Russia, this concept is often referred to as the organizational structure.  Only described it is not true.  Often this is a set of rectangles and arrows, which shows who submits to whom.  Sometimes useful, but often stupid and meaningless tools. <br><br>  How to describe the unit? <br>  From my point of view, the divisions should be described as a hierarchical structure, where each node should contain the following data: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Responsible</b> - the person who is responsible for this unit </li><li>  <b>The product</b> (PCU) or Valuable End Product of this unit.  According to the ISO 9000 standard, the product is the result of the unit‚Äôs activities.  It is quite difficult to correctly identify and formulate a product of a unit.  But very helpful.  Employees will understand better what and why they are doing. </li><li>  <b>Posts</b> - what posts are in this division and who occupies them?  In part, this is similar to the concept of staffing.  We will know how many employees in this division and who is responsible for what? </li><li>  <b>Indicators</b> - it is important to understand by what indicators this unit is evaluated and for what exactly is the responsible person responsible? </li><li>  <b>Subsidiaries</b> - what units are included in this unit?  If there is. </li><li>  <b>Parent unit</b> - what unit is this unit subordinate to?  If this is the head unit, then we can say that it manages only subsidiaries. </li><li>  <b>Contact not data</b> - how to contact the unit? </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Examples</b> <br><br>  I will give only a short list as an example of units: <br><ul><li>  Marketing department </li><li>  Office </li><li>  IT department </li><li>  Owner's office </li><li>  Board of Directors </li><li>  Procurement Management </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Posts </h5><br>  Post - this is the site for which the employee is responsible.  You can say that these are posts. <br><br>  The description of the post is very similar to the description of the submission, but there are differences: <br><br><ul><li>  Responsible - indicate the person who holds the post </li><li>  Product - each post should also have a product description.  Otherwise, the product of the unit is taken. </li><li>  Indicators - each post is evaluated by some indicators.  Own or division. </li><li>  Division - to which division is the post? </li><li>  Contact details - how to contact the post?  Can be taken from the unit. </li></ul><br><br>  A common mistake is that in the org structure one person takes up only one post.  Often this distorts the picture of the world.  In reality, it often happens that one person (person) can hold several different positions in an organization.  This is called "combination." <br><br>  If you go to extremes, then in the microbusiness, there may be a situation when there is only one person with the status of individual entrepreneur, but in fact he already is an organization of 5-10 posts with the same person at each post.  He is responsible for profit, for sales, for production, for purchases and for everything.  The whole structure is in his head.  Just as the business grows, it begins to replace some of the posts with other employees. <br><br>  We have gone a little further, and another company may hold the post.  For example, we have accounting in outsourcing.  And as the person responsible for the post is a person from another organization.  Our curator in outsourcing accounting. <br><br><h5>  Persons </h5><br>  In essence, this is a list of persons.  Specific people who work in an organization or in other organizations.  These persons become responsible for divisions or posts. <br><br>  Posts remain unchanged, but the person may vary.  For example, we can remove Peter from the post of marketing specialist and put Olga there.  The post will remain the same, the contact details are usually the same, but the person is changing. <br><br>  One person can be responsible for several units or posts at once.  This is essentially a combination.  At different posts, it can be evaluated in different ways and have different forms of remuneration. <br><br>  The person record usually contains basic data: <br><br><ul><li>  Full name </li><li>  Contact details </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Processes </h5><br>  A process is a procedure for obtaining a product.  A product is the result of a process or division.  These concepts are taken from the ISO 9000 standard. <br><br>  We use the <a href="http://systemo.biz/opisanie-biznes-protsessov-metodom-5sh/">5Sh</a> methodology to describe each business process. <br><br>  In essence, the process is an instruction that describes the procedure in 5 steps: <br><br><ol><li>  definition - how the start event is determined by this process.  How to understand when to start working on this process? </li><li>  registration - how are operations registered in this process?  in 1C, CRM or ERP system? </li><li>  preparation - what do we do at the preparation stage? </li><li>  performance - what do we do at the performance stage? </li><li>  closing - how do we whack an operation?  What you need to click in the IP, or where and how to file paper documents at the end? </li></ol><br><br>  Do we indicate to the process which division it belongs to?  One process can relate to several units at once. <br><br>  <b>There is one popular mistake and ambush.</b>  Which sounds like "Subprocess".  There is no such thing.  But the author, by youth and stupidity, resorted to this concept until he entered the essence of the Division into the formula.  Subprocesses were needed to reflect the hierarchy.  But with the experience came the understanding that the hierarchy can only be in units.  And processes are a taxonomy of the flat type and there can be no subprocesses here.  This is a complex idea that is not easy to convey shortly.  Therefore, if someone wants to argue, then it will be possible to reflect it in a separate article. <br><br><h5>  Procedures </h5><br>  This is another very interesting and not simple entity.  For a long time I could not find her a place in our knowledge base. <br><br>  According to the ISO 9000 standard, it sounds like this: an established procedure.  And it is very similar in this respect to the definition of the term ‚ÄúProcess‚Äù.  The only difference is that the process describes getting the product, but the procedure is not. <br><br>  To understand its purpose, I will give examples: <br><br>  1. The "Procurement" process.  In general, it consists of 5 steps.  But purchases are different.  For example, in our case, we can purchase subcontractor services, different types of hosting and digital products (themes, templates, modules) in different markets and from different suppliers.  Some of which has features.  So the procurement process always looks the same and describes the general procedure.  And procedures describe features for some specific cases.  For example, we have described the procedures for purchasing on the ThemForest market and the procedure for purchasing hosting and domains on reg.ru. <br><br>  2. The ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù process.  It may include incidents, service requests, consultations.  Moreover, service requests can be further subdivided into types: Password reset, Access issuance, etc. The process is one, it has one order of general actions and it is usually assessed based on one indicator such as ‚Äúaverage closing time‚Äù and ‚Äúnumber of closed operations on the first line without escalation.  But there can be a lot of procedures there.  And depending on the situation, the specialist can work out the process according to different procedures. <br><br>  Procedures are usually attached to the process.  To understand what forms a process can take.  A specialist on the process page could open any of these specified procedures and perform it as it should. <br><br><h5>  Indicators </h5><br>  I think everyone knows this concept.  It is important to determine the indicators by which we evaluate the results. <br><br>  But the results of what?  And How? <br><br>  That's the whole point. <br><br>  Indicators are usually described for the following entities: <br><ul><li>  Divisions - how is the division evaluated? </li><li>  Posts - how are posts rated? </li><li>  Processes - how are processes evaluated? </li><li>  Procedures are rare, but some procedures also need to be evaluated. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Here we have described 7 entities describing the organization or organization. <br><br>  I note that just take and describe it all - is quite difficult. <br><br>  I have been searching for a suitable instrument for a long time.  And in the end I opted for WordPress.  Plus two plugins: Custom Post Maker + AdvancedCustomFields.  Plus a number of their plugins. <br><br>  Now this is a unique development that is fully used only by us and partially implemented by our clients.  Its cost cost us 2 days of work as a programmer :) And the platform itself is free. <br><br>  If you describe it with theses, it looks like this: <br><br><ul><li>  Product structure - allows you to understand what is available and quickly order an internal service (access, fix a mistake, open a vacancy) or launch a purchase.  Product catalog is limited only by the imagination and need of the company. </li><li>  Separate base of divisions, where they are arranged hierarchically and for each division corresponding data are indicated </li><li>  Posts - add posts and indicate the relevant data there.  Including those responsible. </li><li>  Persons - we see who works in the company, who is their name and how to contact.  Including photos. </li><li>  Processes - we have described the main processes according to the method 5Sh.  This significantly reduces the cost of training. </li><li>  Procedures - associated with processes and also reduce the number of questions and the cost of training </li><li>  Indicators - not only that each entity describes the indicators by which they are assessed, there is also a reporting module that allows you to view indicators (statistics) in real time, and understand the dynamics (positive or negative). </li></ul><br><br>  Creating such a system is not a one-time project.  This is a permanent job.  But the cost of its creation pays off with interest.  Even in the basic version, it already allows to significantly reduce the operating costs of the organization, improve the quality of products and stability of processes. <br><br>  And nothing better than WordPress, we did not find for these purposes.  If someone has a different experience, please share in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291800/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291800/</a></p>
