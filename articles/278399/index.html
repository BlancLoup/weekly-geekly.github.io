It was known as <b>‚ÄúA Compiler‚Äù</b> , and its first version was <b>A-0</b> . <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThey could not believe it,‚Äù she said.</i>  <i>‚ÄúI had a working compiler, and no one used it.</i>  <i>I was told that a computer can only perform arithmetic operations. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  In 1954, Grace became the head of the automation and programming department, and her department released some of the first compilers, including ARITH-MATIC, MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC. <br><br><h4>  COBOL </h4><br>  In the spring of 1959, the COBOL language was standardized at the Conference on the Languages ‚Äã‚Äãof Data Processing Systems (CODASYL). <br>  The new language was an extension of Hopper's FLOW-MATIC and contained some ideas from COMTRAN, a similar language from IBM. <br>  In this language, Hopper had the idea that <b>programs should be written in a language that is closer to English than in a language that is closer to machine code</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66d/8c6/f90/66d8c6f904cae158f94b8d7398cbd0bb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From 1967 to 1977, Grace led the Navy Programming Languages ‚Äã‚ÄãGroup (Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning) and was promoted to captain in 1973.  She developed software for COBOL and its compiler, which was part of the COBOL standardization program. <br><br>  In the 1970s  Hopper convinced the Department of Defense to replace the large centralized systems with a network of small computers located in different places.  Any user of any computer site could get access to databases stored in the network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0af/62d/553/0af62d553618f2a3ae064ff2542f7ec6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  She first applied standardization to the testing of computer systems and components, and most importantly, to early programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as FORTRAN and COBOL. <br><br><h4>  Bug </h4><br>  In 1946, at Harvard, working at the Mark 2 and Mark 3 computers, trying to understand the causes of the error, a mole was found in the relay.  The insect was carefully removed and taped to tape with logs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf9/4d8/6b2/cf94d86b20d764d7eb0f94f9a3cbb64b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"First actual case of bug being found"</i> <br><br><h4>  Nano - and picoseconds </h4><br>  Hopper is famous for its nanosecond visual aids.  People (for example, generals and admirals) often asked her why satellite communications take so long.  For clarity, Grace began to give them a length of cord length of 30 centimeters, because it is so much the light passes in one nanosecond.  Grace gave the nanosecond metronome to these segments.  Hopper clarified to the audience that this is the maximum distance that light travels in a vacuum without interference, and that the signals travel longer along real cables that served it as a guide. <br><br>  She later used the same metaphor to illustrate why computers should be small to be faster.  In many of her lectures and visits, she distributed ‚Äúnanoseconds‚Äù to the audience, complementing the presentation with a 300-meter-long cable bay, denoting a microsecond.  Reading lectures in the future for DEC, she handed out packets of peppers, which she called "picoseconds." <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEpsKnWZrJ8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiUMOAHmOtgJrCF8zbCp0JDM1BFPQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Confession </h4><br>  The ship named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Hopper_(DDG-70)">USS Hopper (DDG-70)</a> was named after her: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc4/50c/103/dc450c103014098bbd45e61223603215.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_XE6">Cray XE6</a> supercomputer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/861/25f/cf3/86125fcf39f242d991a24d8ecf7326b3.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/doodles/grace-hoppers-107th-birthday">Google Doodle</a> for 107 anniversary: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2db/b20/244/2dbb202441c7dfb6649ac884664d70d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first woman to receive the title of Rear Admiral of the Fleet and the Defense Distinguished Service Medal (the highest award for non-combat service). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/012/7fc/3c8/0127fc3c836c3d2add9be4e9fa9f5be9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  The Queen of Code </h4><br>  About Grace Hopper shot a <a href="https://vimeo.com/118556349">documentary for 15 minutes</a> , look at the performances of this woman in front of an audience, the hall often burst into laughter from her stories. <br><br> <a href="https://vimeo.com/118556349"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99e/f98/6f7/99ef986f75bb4484b13c2dc9a66c5c43.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Trailer: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zStPSZgAVRE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgGVi4L6twFsnnlB23AJQPWw-kcHA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The full version is <a href="https://vimeo.com/118556349">here</a> . <br><br>  Grace Hopper Long Lecture About Satellite Communication <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Ra2kt1Mpg8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhcy--JMKVQTGVAIef68kM9CkHhjA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br><br>  Together with the company <a href="http://www.edsd.ru/">Edison we</a> continue the spring marathon of publications. <br><br>  I will try to get to the primary sources of IT-technologies, to understand how they thought and what concepts were in the minds of the pioneers, what they dreamed about, how they saw the world of the future.  Why did you think ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù, ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù, ‚Äúhypertext‚Äù, ‚Äúintelligence amplifiers‚Äù, ‚Äúcollective problem solving system‚Äù, what meaning did they put into these concepts, what tools they wanted to achieve a result. <br><br>  I hope that these materials will serve as an inspiration for those who are wondering how to go <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/2408/">‚Äúfrom Zero to Unit‚Äù</a> (to create something that had never happened before).
