  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet Economics Forum: benefits for IT companies, protection of opinions in social networks, Putin‚Äôs unexpected offer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On December 22, Vladimir Putin joined the <a href="http://ie.iri.center/">Internet Economy</a> Forum in Moscow to discuss a long-term Internet development program in Russia. <br><br>  In February 2016, the Institute for Internet Development ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2">IRI</a> ) will send official proposals for the runet development strategy to the Government of the Russian Federation, the Presidential Administration, the Ministry of Communications.  The development of the runet should be carried out in the following areas: sovereignty, society, finance, medicine, trade, education and the city. <br><br><h4>  Benefits for IT companies </h4><br>  Russian President Vladimir Putin will consider a proposal to extend benefits for insurance premiums for IT companies.  By 2014, thanks to privileges, the volume of software sales rose to 102 billion rubles from 28 billion rubles in 2010.  However, this exemption is canceled in 2017, and the meeting participants asked to extend it. <a name="habracut"></a>

      ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt but agree with those who, pointing to the decisions we make in the real sector of the economy - in industry and agriculture, says that we provide benefits for Russian market participants, for domestic producers.  Why not do the same here?  Yes, we agree, we are ready, we will think, we will do it.  Only, naturally, so that it does not violate our obligations under the WTO, ‚ÄùPutin stressed. <br><br>  The preferential rate of insurance premiums until the end of 2017 for Russian IT companies that have undergone special accreditation at the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media is 14%.  The standard premium for all others is 30%.  It was planned that from 2018 it will increase to 21%, in 2019 - to 28%, and from January 1, 2020 - to the standard 30%. <br><br>  In early October of this year, it became known that the Minister of Communications and Mass Communications Nikolai Nikiforov turned to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev with a proposal to extend the validity period of preferential insurance contributions for IT companies.  The Ministry of Communications proposed to extend the 14% tariff until the end of 2023, 21% - until the end of 2024 and 29% - until 2025, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/12/22/622089-putin-podumaet-it-lgotami">according</a> to Vedomosti. <br><br>  If in 2018 the fiscal burden on Russian IT companies increases, they will start losing competition for employees to global companies.  And the deterioration of the state of health of the IT industry, according to Nikiforov, will affect not only the technological development of the country, but also other sectors of the economy. <br><br>  Nikiforova supported the Ministry of Economic Development, but the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labor opposed the extension of lower tariffs.  The reason is the deficit of the federal budget, as well as the budgets of social security funds and compulsory medical insurance. <br><br>  Reduced rates of insurance contributions in the message on its website the Ministry of Communications calls an effective measure - it has spread to about 34.5% of all workers in the IT industry.  Financial performance of such companies are growing faster, the agency notes. <br><br><h4>  Protection of "personal" data </h4><br>  Natalia Kasperskaya, co-founder <a href="http://www.kaspersky.ru/">of Kaspersky Lab</a> , the founder of <a href="http://www.infowatch.ru/">Infowatch</a> , also spoke at the forum. She called for regulating the protection of not only personal data, but also so-called personal data.  She explained that they are referring to the views and opinions of people in social networks. <br><br>  According to Kaspersky, this ‚Äústorehouse of knowledge‚Äù provides a great opportunity to manipulate people.  Kaspersky explained that we are talking about possible surveillance and unauthorized access to personal data of users from states, companies and other structures, the spread of illegal and malicious content on the Internet and information wars - the spread of propaganda, stuffing, information attacks on the state, companies and citizens Russia. <br><br>  Russian companies have proposed to the president to develop a "procedure for proactive analysis and blocking unwanted content at the level of individual pages."  They also proposed to create a center for monitoring and responding to information threats, as well as to form the legal basis for responsibility for information attacks on the critical infrastructure of the state. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe need to create a legal basis for punishing such information attacks,‚Äù said Natalya Kasperskaya. <br><br>  Vladimir Putin supported this idea, but urged to act carefully - ‚Äúnot to interfere in the personal life of citizens.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  The appointment of Hermann Klimenko </h4><br>  But the main news was the unexpected proposal made by Putin to the head of the Institute for Internet Development (IRI) and the founder of LiveInternet company Herman Klimenko. <br><br>  German Klimenko will become advisor to President Vladimir Putin on the Internet economy.  Klimenko will be responsible for the development of industries related to the Internet, and promote the ideas of industry representatives, <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/56794b709a7947c1acecbd7d">told</a> a RBC source in the Kremlin.  According to him, these topics are on the boundaries of the areas of responsibility of the presidential aide for economics, Andrey Belousov, and the information technology assistant, Igor Shchegolev, so a new adviser was needed. <br><br>  The president made an offer to Klimenko, communicating with representatives of IT companies before the plenary session of the Internet Economics Forum, which was held in Moscow at the World Trade Center.  ‚ÄúI have a suggestion: go to work in the presidential administration,‚Äù Putin said. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297470/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297470/</a></p>
