    <h2>  <font color="#cc0000">What is OneDrive for business designed for?</font> </h2><br>  In order for users to use OneDrive for Business, a company, it‚Äôs enough to purchase an Office 365 plan. Currently, each user will receive 1TB of disk space (there is <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/onedrive-for-business/compare-onedrive-for-business-plans%3Ftab%3Dtabs-1">an</a> ODfB <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/onedrive-for-business/compare-onedrive-for-business-plans%3Ftab%3Dtabs-1">plan</a> that provides subscribers with up to 5TB of space, purchased separately from Office 365). <br><br>  If the company did not implement Office 365, its employees can still get disk space in the <b>SharePoint</b> farm in the form of a personal site.  In this scenario, the company can control what users can save in OneDrive for Business and how much disk space is available to them. <br><br>  Access to disk space ‚Äî whether local or in Office 365 ‚Äî is done via the web interface or the <b>client for OneDrive</b> . <br><br>  The OneDrive for Business service <b>libraries are</b> based on SharePoint technology, which is optimized for business scenarios.  Among other things, this means that document revision control, metadata, and automatic processing by SharePoint workflows may be available for documents. <br><br>  Compared to Dropbox or Google Drive, a significant advantage for companies is that files remain under their control.  For example, the system has the functionality of blocking access to ODfB from a specific location, monitoring published resources or archiving files and all from a centralized document management system. <br><br>  The OneDrive for Business data storage service can also replace a <b>personal drive</b> that is still used by many companies.  This means that employees can be provided with improved performance without a load on the local <b>infrastructure</b> (of course, in addition to network bandwidth), especially considering that Microsoft provides each user with 1 TB of disk space and provides access to documents from mobile devices. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">Different clients for OneDrive</font> </h2><br>  Currently, there are two versions of the client used to <b>synchronize</b> files between computers: the standard and the so-called " <a href="https://support.office.com/ru-ru/article/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BA-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2581-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2585%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-OneDrive-%25D0%25B2-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49%3Fomkt%3Dru-RU%26ui%3Dru-RU%26rs%3Dru-RU%26ad%3DRU">New generation synchronization client</a> " (NGSC).  NGSC is based on modern synchronization technology already used in private versions of the OneDrive service. <br><br>  This client is already included in the standard package of computers with <a href="http://www.comparex-group.com/web/ru/enterprise-agreement/products/operating-system-server/windows10/windows.htm">Windows 10</a> or computers that have the full version of <b>Office 2016</b> installed, however, of course, you can install it yourself.  Users can use this client at the same time for personal needs (ie, synchronization with their own OneDrive) and work tasks (ie, ODfB).  Such files are also available offline.  New and edited documents can be saved in local settings and then synchronized as soon as you access the Internet or the company network.  <b>Group policies</b> can be used to <b>control the</b> available client functions.  Now (as of September 2016), NGSC does not provide for synchronization of regular SharePoint document libraries from the company's SharePoint environment.  However, an old client (based on <a href="https://support.office.com/ru-ru/article/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4-%25D1%2581-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2585%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-OneDrive-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F-%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0-4100df3a-0c96-464f-b0a8-c20de34da6fa%3Fomkt%3Dru-RU%26ui%3Dru-RU%26rs%3Dru-RU%26ad%3DRU">Groove</a> ) can still handle this task. <br><br>  The following synchronization options are possible: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85d/124/b20/85d124b20f6a4bc694e739649c92fbed.png"></div><br>  During the year, Microsoft will release additional updates for NGSC that will make it possible to synchronize SharePoint libraries. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">OneDrive for Business gives employees what they need</font> </h2><br>  Until today, companies have used Dropbox or similar services to share files with other companies.  However, these services have a key <b>flaw</b> in terms of company interests.  Files are stored on <b>unknown servers</b> in the USA.  OneDrive for Business offers its users popular features (document sharing, access from mobile devices, synchronization of changes made offline), while at the same time giving companies the level of administration they need.  Currently, no service on the market can provide the same high degree of integration in SharePoint, Office, and Windows. <br><br>  Of course, companies need a plan if they want to implement the OneDrive for Business data storage service - be it local as a personal site or as part of Office 365. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Companies must ask the following questions before implementing this service:</font> </h3><br><ul><li>  How much <b>disk space</b> can employees get? </li><li>  What <b>documents</b> can employees save to your OneDrive? </li><li>  How can I transfer the content of <b>personal storage media</b> to the cloud storage? </li><li>  What <b>data / information sharing</b> options are available? </li><li>  What <b>OneDrive Client</b> Do Companies Need? </li><li>  What content can be accessed using <b>mobile devices</b> ? </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315492/</a></p>
