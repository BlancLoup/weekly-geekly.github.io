  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Technical features of the Mercedes S-Class</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/190022/">previous post</a> I described technologies aimed at ensuring the safety of drivers.  Habr's readers did not have enough technical details about each technology.  I promised to make a separate post, but first I would like to complete a review of the latest automated systems.  In this post, I mostly talk about technologies that increase the comfort and controllability of the Mercedess S-Class car.  And in the following, I will concentrate on the technical details of all these systems.  So, let's begin. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Crosswind assist</b> <br><br>  Translated as "protection against cross-wind."  Mercedes states that this system will help the driver to more easily cope with the transverse wind electronically.  If the car is equipped with the Magic Body Control system, the system itself adjusts the suspension stiffness so that the car travels along the most direct path. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/75f/87f/219/75f87f219fbcf5012946eb15f31860d0.jpg" alt="image">  If the car does not have an ABC system, then a stabilization system is used, which brakes the wheels on one side of the car to better hold the trajectory.

      <b>Body frame</b> <br><br>  Mercedes calls the W222‚Ä≤s structure a ‚Äúhybrid aluminum carcass bodywork‚Äù.  In addition to a significant increase in safety, Mercedes states that the body of the W222 will weigh less than the body of the W140, produced since 1991.  Aluminum parts made by casting, stretching and stamping make up more than 50% of the structure of the car.  At the same time, the rigidity of some parts is enhanced by a special foam that fits inside the hollow aluminum structures, which does not lead to a significant increase in vehicle weight.  The stiffness of the frame for twisting increased by as much as 50% compared to the previous body. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/83d/0aa/6ac/83d0aa6acf910d1118f66c3ac4b1dc73.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/03f/15a/03e/03f15a03e3f95bbf68e3a396bb48545c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Lighting</b> <br><br>  The new S-class will be the first car in the world in which no bulbs are used at all.  In the headlights will be used 56 LEDs, 35 in the rear lights, 4 in the fog and up to 300 in the car, depending on the configuration.  The use of LEDs allows you to achieve a significant reduction in electricity consumption.  Diode headlights use 35W, 84W xenon, and traditional halogen altogether 120W.  LED lights automatically adjust the beam to suit road conditions.  Rear lights can be dimmed in traffic so as not to blind drivers behind you. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d41/cbf/998/d41cbf99835be15ffcd1d21ea0acadff.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Aerodynamics</b> <br><br>  The new S-class turned out to be quite slippery, the drag coefficient of just 0.24 Cd, by the way in the past generation, the coefficient was 0.26 Cd.  Engineers say they checked millions of parts to identify the best aerodynamics, the car will squat 2 cm upon reaching 100 km / h.  The car has a fully airtight front end to direct the air flow exactly to the radiators to cool the engine.  There is a special curtain in front of the cooling radiator, which in cases where the engine has not reached a high temperature, directs the air flow under the car.  All the bottom of the car has an aerodynamic structure for better handling of the car at speed. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f18/fa1/297/f18fa12979bfa766c469d101e5d1ad69.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Road surface scan</b> <br><br>  Using a new stereo camera from the back of the rearview mirror, Mercedes invented the new Magic Body Control proactive suspension.  The camera scans the road surface in front at a distance of 15 meters (during the day at a speed of up to 130 km / h) and creates a three-dimensional image of the road in front of the car.  This allows the car to calculate the best way to reduce the impact of pavement on the body. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/47e/d10/7d1/47ed107d1f78e9ff66f65c5c8a66f128.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe6/2bb/bb0/fe62bbbb0bf687160b1bd255273bbdf1.jpg">  The car adjusts each wheel to a specific compression using the active suspension.  Dampers, in each of which there is a hydraulic piston, can adjust the spring stiffness and, accordingly, the smoothness of the entire vehicle.  Calculations for each of the shock absorbers take literally a split second, so that any wheel can almost completely compensate for getting into the pit and rocking the body. <br><br>  <b>Collision avoidance system</b> <br><br>  The system does not manifest itself in cases where your security is not threatened.  The system will help you to prevent hitting the rear at speeds from 30 to 250 km / h.  If the driver is distracted, the system will be able to notice the danger in advance and give an audible and visual signal.  When the driver responds to the beeps, the electronics will adjust enough pressure in the brake system to avoid a collision. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/64b/c84/fbd/64bc84fbd71f485e66f9a0d8f4cc89c1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Road sign recognition system</b> <br><br>  The new system will not only be able to recognize traffic signs, but also recognize signs prohibiting movement in a certain direction.  The information received from the camera is synchronized with navigation, which allows electronics to understand in difficult situations. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a13/a79/cc1/a13a79cc129646694140af402238bcc4.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Adaptive cruise control with Stop &amp; Go function</b> <br><br>  The new cruise control system will allow the car not only to maintain a distance from the car ahead of you, but also to stop and get under way in a traffic jam.  Cruise control works in tandem with the system that monitors the lane, helping the driver to drive in the middle of the lane.  Even in cases where the markings are fuzzy, the car will be guided by the trajectory of the car in front of it.  The system is so sensitive that it can know whether the driver‚Äôs hands are on the steering wheel.  If there are no hands on the steering wheel, the system will warn with an audible and visual signal. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/93b/1a4/7e4/93b1a47e434350798c9653b038ae4414.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Automatic parking system</b> <br><br>  A car equipped with this option can park itself without the driver‚Äôs participation in both parallel and perpendicular parking spaces; the driver only needs to take his foot off the brake pedal and lightly touch the gas pedal. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/750/6ed/ecc/7506edecc2c7c90a67040102787380b4.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Night-vision device</b> <br><br>  The new night vision system can recognize the danger ahead of the car, it can even distinguish animals from humans.  If a person or a large animal appears in front of the car, the system will highlight it with a red frame on the dashboard, where a black and white picture from the night vision camera will be shown.  If a person appears in front of you, then the system will shine special sections in the headlights on it to make the pedestrian more visible.  On animals, the system will not shine, because  this can cause inadequate reactions, which will lead to undesirable consequences.  If the system is turned on during the day, it makes sense, for example, in the fog, it will not highlight people, so as not to impair visibility. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc7/a97/1e2/cc7a971e2bff7b05c82a20c8da289ad6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>One step closer to the car that will drive itself</b> <br><br>  The premiere of the new S-class was held in Hamburg, in a giant factory where the world's largest double-deck A380 aircraft are manufactured.  Perhaps this Mercedes wanted to show the advantage of its car over other brands, just like Airbus did.  Between these two advances in technology, there is now a very similar category - they are both on their way to autopilot.  The new A380 can fly itself, which has long become commonplace for everyone, but now the A380 can also land itself using computer control.  Mercedes director Dieter Zetsche said that now the most boring part of driving is standing in a traffic jam no longer requires your participation.  The new S-Class will use its sensors, which are located throughout the car and control 360 degrees around the car, and will now be able to drive in traffic jams and even allow them to lift their hands off the wheel!  If prohibited by law, the autopilot will turn off 15 seconds after you remove your hands from the steering wheel. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/473/1a2/06f/4731a206fd05d2c8b644d8db1f2969c0.jpg">  Mercedes has become the first news of the new European Union policy aimed at reducing the accident rate of cars.  Most likely, future cars will be very limited in capabilities by electronics and the policy of the country in which they are operated. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa8/547/710/aa8547710b770d8753928ddec68e4e2f.jpg"><br><br>  The article used material from the site <a href="http://www.autolynch.ru/">autolynch.ru</a> . <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190532/</a></p>
