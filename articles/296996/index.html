The income of the first participants of the pyramid is paid at the expense of the contributions of subsequent participants.  In most cases, the true source of income is hidden and declared fictional or insignificant.  Such a substitution is fraud.

      As a rule, the financial pyramid promises a high yield, which cannot be maintained for a long time, and the repayment of the pyramid obligations to all participants becomes obviously impracticable. ‚Äù <br><br>  It is clear that the classical scheme of coupon business does not imply fraudulent schemes, but in the realities of our country the rules change a little. <br><br>  The fact is that initially everything seemed to be transparent (for the option when the coupon value is equal to the cost of the service / product): <br><br><ul><li>  the partner does the action, ensures the fulfillment of the promised services or the delivery of goods in proper quality. </li><li>  customers buy coupons, transferring money to the service. </li><li>  the service bites off a piece of the value of the coupons, and the rest translates to the partner. </li></ul><br><br>  You can see that we have a two-way "Ostap Bender": <br><ul><li>  - clients pay money in the morning, get chairs in the evening. </li><li>  - partners give out chairs in the evening, receive money the next morning. </li></ul><br>  And the money is all in coupon service. <br><br>  This is where the temptation to twist somewhere "temporarily" no man's money.  But in order for the effect of torsion to be - it is necessary to hold the money on your side for as long as possible.  As a result, delays in payments and returns to partners and customers begin. <br><br>  The service can go a little further and create a promotion with an attractive price for a popular product, while creating a ‚Äúpartner‚Äù.  The money collected from customers should be set aside for a good cause, the delivery dates are deliberately postponed, explaining, not with a serious "partner" approach, but for the first impatient users to return money.  I think it‚Äôs understandable what to do next: we squeeze the deadlines to the maximum, we return money only to very active clients, and when the black thing is done, we‚Äôll proudly return everything and everyone, telling in what unequal fight we had to engage with an unscrupulous partner. <br><br>  And if you go further? <br><br>  It is possible, but it will have to take the company to offshore with all the consequences, but after that you can safely score on most of the payments on new shares, part of the money on advertising, office support, well, limited payments on old shares and only on the appropriate court decision . <br><br><h6>  Recall at least a share of one coupon service with iPhone 4S: <br>  October 19, 2011 on bigbuzzy started the sale of the iPhone 4S for a funny 19 990 rubles.  More than 7.5 thousand people bought coupons, but still many (according to some information most) can not get phones, more precisely now everyone wants, of course, to get money, and not last year‚Äôs iPhone.  And what about the service?  And the service received 150 million rubles for a couple of weeks. </h6><br><br>  This is where the similarity with the classical pyramid scheme is manifested: financial receipts from the latest sales of coupons are spent on maintaining office life and advertising, while only partially funds are allocated to pay for old debts. <br><br><h4>  So, and who went bankrupt? </h4><br>  On September 27, the company BIGBAZI, filed with the Supreme Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation documents, on the basis of which it asks to declare itself bankrupt. <br><br>  Proof: <a href="http://kad.arbitr.ru/Card/5b5d58e0-7657-4fe3-ae85-248a6247f541">kad.arbitr.ru</a> <br><br>  If you do a search on the site of the arbitration court for cases involving Bigbazzi LLC, then you can find dozens of disputes with Bigbazzi. <br><br>  And as many of them on the Internet: a fan group of deceived <a href="http://vk.com/topic-31299073_27005959">partners</a> and <a href="http://vk.com/obmanbigbuzzy">customers</a> in contact. <br>  Sadly, the rather good (at first) service turned into a pyramid. <br><br>  But is this a design error or a banal fraud? <br><br><h6>  To the note: very often in the eyes of the average man in the street ‚Äúfinancial pyramid‚Äù and ‚Äúfraud‚Äù are synonymous.  However, in fact it is not always the same.  When launching a long-term project, its initiator may be mistaken in his forecasts, and then the financial pyramid is a simple consequence of a design error. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296996/</a></p>
