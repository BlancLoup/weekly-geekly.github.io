It will go out of style. ‚Äù  Or, as <a href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/about">Mark Bolton</a> , co-founder of the <a href="http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/">‚ÄúFive Simple Steps</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/">‚Äù tweeted</a> : <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI desperately ask everyone to stop giving digital creations the appearance of real objects.  The screen is not a shaded relief board. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  However, Apple and many other software developers continue to actively use this technique in some applications.  Many are furious, not wondering why.  Why does Apple and many others go on a slippery slope?  They all lost a sense of quality design, that's for sure.  Or not? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There are some advantages in the practicality of skeumorphic design, which are often lauded.  In Aybukx, for example, Apple through the use of book metaphor makes it obvious that you want to turn pages using swipe.  Elasticity - a cute, small effect when scrolling to the end of the list - is also largely skeuomorphism, although this almost imperceptible effect was loved by many.  But since these advantages of skeuomorphism are so good, let's talk about skeuomorphism, which deduces people from themselves, which is obviously useless, which pursues exclusively decorating purposes. <br><br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812%3Fmt%3D8">"Paper"</a> - an application for drawing on iPad.  It was released quite recently and caused a certain resonance.  Here is what you see first after launching the application: 
      <br>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/906/31d/f11/90631df117e3859c0d1cedebf93fb6b6.jpg"><br><br>  Notebooks to fail me!  It simply <i>must</i> be the solution of a certain designer who loves to grind pixels and create photorealistic icons.  Perhaps he just wanted to amuse his design ego and send a couple of screenshots to <a href="http://dribbble.com/">Dribble</a> .  It has nothing to do with developing good software. <br><br>  Well, perhaps that is connected. <br><br>  Let's take a look at Paper.  This is how <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/">‚ÄúFifty Three‚Äù</a> , which developed the application (founded by former employees of Microsoft), presents it in Up Store (my accents): <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúPaper‚Äù is a place where <b>ideas originate</b> .  This is the easiest and most beautiful way to create on iPad.  <b>Capture ideas as sketches</b> , diagrams, illustrations, notes, or drawings and spread them across the web.  [...] ‚ÄúPaper‚Äù works like you used to, like a familiar <b>notebook or diary</b> .  Keep all your ideas together, always with you. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  It's all about collecting ideas.  Quick and dirty.  It is here to quickly sketch something.  This is just a notebook.  A drawing application can be anything: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/draft/id375570329%3Fmt%3D8">something for prototyping and sketching,</a> or a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id363590649%3Fmt%3D8">tool for professional artists</a> .  Anyway, Paper is not like that.  The interface not only keeps in touch with its purpose, but also helps you immerse yourself in a state in which you are not shy about expressing your ideas without bias.  The interface tells the story and sets the tone for all experiences. <br><br>  This is the start screen for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id363590649%3Fmt%3D8">the Brashys</a> drawing application used to create at least four New Yorker covers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b7b/86b/ec6/b7b86bec653fa086f0639335191c6e8b.jpg"><br><br>  The interface tells a completely different story.  If I wish to spend an hour or two on the implementation of one of my ideas, this interface will only spur me on.  If I want to quickly make a couple of sketches, this interface can discourage such a desire.  I do not want my ugly, hastily drawn sketches were placed on the wall in a frame for all to see.  I'll think twice before quickly jotting something in this application. <br><br>  The functional "Paper" and "Brashis" is almost identical, but the pursued assignment is categorically different. <br><br>  In the ‚ÄúSnow Leopard‚Äù application ‚ÄúPhoto Bus‚Äù looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a2/d88/93a/5a2d8893a684e08669098977cf33f40c.jpg"><br><br>  And later the ‚ÄúLion‚Äù appeared with its full-screen mode.  The composition of skevomorphism arrives on the first platform: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb1/956/332/fb1956332cbc7d8cbe7bf652d767a910.jpg"><br><br>  Bang!  Blinds.  Wooden panels.  Metal buttons.  "Apple", is it true? <br><br>  Once again, let's take a look at the ‚ÄúPhoto Bus‚Äù function: take pictures, record video clips and apply various filters to them.  The first version made it easy and simple.  She, however, did not keep in touch with the purpose of the ‚ÄúPhoto Bus‚Äù: fool around and have fun.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRe_IiPmGjWg">Let me demonstrate</a> : <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Re_IiPmGjWg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhgW_-SUjX4yqK7sS5KFLPo_MKesg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚ÄúPhoto Bus‚Äù is a digital toy.  The first version, even if neat and functional, did not look like a toy.  She was not fun, did not cause the desire to play with her.  In the new full-screen version, Apple uses skechomorphism to draw users into the game. <br><br>  Skevomorphism is really about the connection with feelings and their fixation, about bringing the application to the level of not just a tool, but a memorable experience.  It shows the purpose of the interface, and not just the functions it includes. <br><br>  Making music should be fun, right?  This is a good enough reason for the tablet version of the Garage Band to look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7c1/6df/348/7c16df3484c07dcfca0f2ba8743299bd.jpg"><br><br>  But not so: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/820/807/5dd/8208075dd1d44e8d452ac50ca0e4fd6a.png"><br><br>  And even if this option can be more functional, tidier and closer to the functions of the interface, it is not fun.  With the same success, I can compose music in Excel.  The Garage Band interface not only presents opportunities in a clean and understandable form, it gives a wonderful, fun and memorable experience. <br><br>  Skevomorphism - a powerful tool.  Do not be afraid to use it, but you need to be careful.  For example, it is unlikely to work for such a working application as Mail.  Someone might say that Apple has crossed the border with some applications, for example, with the version of Calendar for Leo or the Find My Friends app for iPhone and iPad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/196/229/768/1962297687278809770b8e16d4bfe229.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps this is true, but take into account the purpose of this application.  It is not about spying on friends, classmates or co-workers.  It is about keeping in touch with friends.  The interface looks, let's be honest, stupid.  However, he is indescribably friendly.  The functionality of the application is quite controversial and, being framed otherwise, as a serious application, it could be fairly perceived as nasty. <br><br>  Josh Clark writes in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449381650/">Tapworthy</a> : <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúDo not dismiss this as a tactile deception;  emotional resonance is the basis of all marketing and storytelling;  and make no mistake, your app is history.  In a fairly personal iPhone context, people perceive the application as content, not as software, as experience, and not as a tool, as entertainment, and not as a task.  The nature of your application sets the tone for this experience, and it should suit your audience, be on hand.  Combining the aesthetics of things with function and with the owner, you get something beautiful, functional and excellent. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Often they say that the design should be invisible.  More importantly, the design should give the opportunity.  Uneasy to use interface, which, however, is fun, involves the user and creates an experience that makes it easier to overcome obstacles and thereby experience in which the product is simpler and more natural to use.  Used intelligently, skewomorphism can preserve the ease of use of the interface, while allowing users to act. <br><br><h4>  From translator </h4> Hello to everyone who was waiting for this translation.
