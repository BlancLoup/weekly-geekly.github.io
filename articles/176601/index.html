Since I want to receive parcels, I sometimes have to think about her and me. <br>  And last night she came to me again.  She did not let me sleep all night, I drove her away, but she did not leave.  It was an idea.  Maybe if I share it with you, she will let me go :-) <br><br>  So, before you - my vision of the perfect mail. <br>  The post will be without photos or screenshots - I really hope on your imagination! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0b5/09b/500/0b509b500b47751911d1012db07ffec3.png" alt=":-)">

      To begin, we define the terms. <br><br>  <strong>Number</strong> - then the same as the "unique number" or "identifier".  Happens at everything (user, package, access point, etc.).  Not to be confused with the "phone number". <br><br>  <strong>Site</strong> - the site of the mail, the same as the "personal account" or "my account". <br><br>  <strong>Package</strong> - a box with the contents, for which everything is being started. <br><br>  <strong>User</strong> - a person who has an account on the site. <br><br>  <strong>Access</strong> point - the point of reception and delivery of parcels. <br><br>  <strong>Order</strong> - or "transaction" or "order".  Includes one or more parcels. <br><br>  So let's go! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br><br>  Mail is not intended to replace the Post of Russia with itself - that is, to be in every village, receive payments, etc. The only job of the Post is the movement of parcels. <br><br>  Mail has many access points.  This is a pavilion with shelves and a pleasant (-s) muscular (-s) operator :).  Access points are located in large / medium-sized shopping centers and are evenly distributed throughout the city. <br><br>  Anyone can register on the site and become a user.  Account tied to a cell phone number (a la Qiwi).  The user does not enter any home addresses.  Instead, he chooses the most convenient (closest) access point (or several). <br><br>  The user has a balance that he can replenish in different ways (again, a la Qiwi). <br><br>  The user can send mail to any other user (both must be registered).  The process of sending a package looks like this - <br><br><ul><li>  the sender enters the site and creates a new ‚Äúorder‚Äù (this is sending one or several parcels, then for simplicity we will send one parcel). </li><li>  the sender enters the recipient's number (of course, conveniences such as address books are possible, etc.), and indicates the recipient's ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù access point as a destination, or selects manually. </li><li>  After creating the service, the site sends the one-time code to the sender via SMS. </li><li>  the sender looks at the table of weights and prices to estimate the price.  If he wants, replenishes the balance. </li><li>  the sender goes to any access point, tells the operator the phone number and one-time code.  The operator finds the order in the computer, weighs the parcel, creates the parcel number, prints the bar code, accepts the parcel.  Prints the document, gives the sender.  For all seconds 30. </li><li>  the package is paid either from the previously replenished balance (then the money is not involved in the process), or the balance can be replenished at the access point (with delivery or putting the balance on the balance). </li><li>  in the process of delivery, the current location of the parcel can be seen on the website for both the sender and the recipient. </li><li>  When the parcel arrives at the recipient's access point, the recipient receives an SMS with an alert and (another) one-time code.  The recipient comes to the access point, says his phone number and one-time code.  The operator prints the document, gives the parcel.  (Also 30 seconds). </li></ul><br><br>  All standard problems (unavailable, stolen phone, etc.) are solved in standard ways (spare number, blocking, etc.). <br><br>  The parcel number is used to automate everything that is possible during the delivery process.  For example - each shelf at the access point has its own bar code.  When the parcel arrives at the access point, the operator scans its number and shelf number.  And when the recipient arrives, the operator sees on the computer which shelf his parcel is on. <br><br><hr><br><br>  Some more meta-thoughts (thoughts about thoughts): <br><br><ul><li>  This is all, so to speak, the front-end.  The back-end in this post was not comprehended, but I believe that it is possible. </li><li>  Also, international shipping and customs relations were not comprehended, because what is there to think about :-(. </li><li>  at first I thought about mail without any participation of workers (automated access points).  But this, I fear, would work only in a very civilized society. </li><li>  I understand that the practical meaning of this post is very small.  I believe that this might work, but this is clearly not an idea for a startup.  And not even for a small investor. </li></ul><br><br>  Thank you and have a nice sunday! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3d1/c29/b3e/3d1c29b3e616fe329de466b200cef4f0.png" alt=":-)"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176601/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176601/</a></p>
