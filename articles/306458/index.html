Due to the rapid development of free classifieds sites in Russia, entrepreneurs have an interesting opportunity: to distribute sales throughout the country, not doing either an online store promotion or creating a special sales department.  In general, literally 1-2 people can conduct business, who simply take orders and send them by mail, or by transport companies. <br><br>  Often, a small business is born from the purchase of some interesting product, ad placement and a gradual increase in the flow of sales.  However, if the business is progressing, there are more and more goods and there is a desire to launch sales in new cities, the entrepreneur has to use additional regional sites and post new ads on them.  But this is where the problem arises: many sites - the same Avito - do not allow duplicate ads in one account, so each new recurring ad needs its own unique phone number, and customers from Tambov do not have to call Moscow mobile phones (because they can to guess about it by the code 925 or 985 and not to call the ‚Äúintercity‚Äù at all), it is better that the number be regional.

In addition, the problem of recording orders becomes a real hell - in the absence of automation equipment, you need to constantly carry around a notebook in which to record that Galina from Samara needs 100 pairs of black socks, and Elena from Syktyvkar - 200 orange stockings. <br><br>  <b>CRM and Hive integration</b> <br><br>  Today we will talk about how to solve this issue easily and easily with the help of ready-made cloud solutions in the form of amoCRM CRM service and Hive virtual PBX with Multi IP-SIM technology.  Services are already integrated with each other, so that a businessman does not need to invent or order something additionally.  It is enough to go through a few simple steps to configure the finished system. <br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe solution is to allow an entrepreneur to take orders from multiple numbers on his own, not to get lost in them and not to carry with him a mysterious black notebook with records about who, what and where to send.  This will require. <br><br>  <i>1. Select numbers and configure Multi IP-SIM</i> <br><br>  If you, dear reader of our blog, are not yet a Hive subscriber, this is easy to fix by subscribing to our cloud service.  As soon as you get access to the control panel, you will be able to order a variety of regional phone numbers - in principle, nothing special, this feature is in any virtual PBX, only the list of available regions is different. <br><br>  However, what really matters is the Multi IP-SIM.  You can order a special SIM card that can receive all selected numbers WITHOUT the redirection function.  That is, you receive each call at the rate of incoming call for 0 rubles, setting the rules for their reception in a virtual PBX, as shown in the screenshot below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/745/f29/dc3/745f29dc38d8496a985ba638cfe32bb6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Control Panel - setting up receiving calls from virtual numbers</i> <br><br>  <i>2. Configure Alert Formats</i> <br><br>  Depending on the settings of Hive, taking calls, your smartphone will show either the incoming number or the sequence number of the phone from the control panel.  But since ad groups with a single number are usually tied to specific products and regions, you can create clues for yourself by typing explanations into the phone book (or exporting from Hive).  For example, if you sell radar detectors and video recorders for cars, then when you call to number 23 (from your list of regional numbers) the inscription ‚ÄúRegistrars.  Nizhny Novgorod "or" Detectors.  New Urengoy".  This will help to instantly navigate and correctly build the first communication with the client: ‚ÄúHello, we are glad that you are interested in our most advanced radar detectors!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúAutomotive electronics online store.  Nizhny Novgorod". <br><br>  <i>3. Connect to amoCRM and set up customer cards</i> <br><br>  Since Hive is initially integrated with amoCRM, an entrepreneur can immediately use this solution to work with contact details and a client card.  That is, when you receive a call to your mobile and answer it, you receive a customer card with the phone number already entered.  If this person has already made an order, then all the other fields will be filled.  If not, then you can enter the necessary data and notes directly from your mobile. <br><br>  <b>The result is a complete sales pipeline.</b> <br><br>  What do we get in the end?  A lot of numbers, each of which leads to your Multi IP-SIM or to one of the Multi IP-SIM, when it comes to a partner or family business, help to work with different regions and product groups in person.  The presence of a convenient mobile application amoCRM helps to place orders "on the fly" ... well, or "on the go", forgetting about recording on paper and repeated calls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/007/f61/7d9/007f617d9c754e2897ccbf30cf88044a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>The scheme of the finished "sales pipeline"</i> <br><br>  By the way, this scheme is suitable not only for working with bulletin boards, but also for the development of regional and product sites.  You can write one phone on the Voronezh site, and another on Belgorod - another, creating a sense of regional presence and company scale.  And the availability of information about an incoming call makes it possible to answer such as ‚ÄúHello.  Welcome to the online pet food store in the city of Yaroslavl ‚Äù, and the customer will be sure that his service will be fast and convenient. <br><br>  But what is most interesting is that you can start enjoying these benefits of a few hours by simply purchasing <a href="http://www.iptelefon.su/ip-sim">Multi IP-SIM</a> from <a href="http://www.iptelefon.su/">IPtelefon</a> along with a subscription to the required tariff plan of virtual <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">PBX Hive</a> and <a href="http://www.amocrm.ru/">amoCRM</a> cloud service - simply, quickly and at no extra cost.  In addition, when you do not have the opportunity to answer the call, you can automatically transfer it to your partner to Hive or send it to the ‚ÄúVirtual Secretary‚Äù in order not to miss a single client. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306458/</a></p>
