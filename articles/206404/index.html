  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How and how fast do you feel in your mind at the elementary level?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day friends.  I decided to get a technical education in order to try myself in development.  I don‚Äôt know how I will succeed in this, and whether it will work out at all, but if I don‚Äôt try, I will never know, but this is not about that now. <br><br>  Recently, a friend of mine was interviewed by some kind of ‚Äúlarge international company‚Äù and spoke about one such particular feature of the interview.  He was asked a question, he started answering him, and during the answer he was interrupted and asked to make a calculation quickly, for example, ‚Äú12% of 84‚Äù, he gives an answer, continues to answer the question, takes half a minute, he is again in the middle of the sentence ‚Äú72 m / s - this is how many km / h? ‚Äù, etc., and at the same time he should not stray from the main idea, to which he gave the answer.  As a result, my friend answered something there, but to myself I thought that for me it would be a serious problem, as I slowly consider in my mind and the supply of my ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù is also very small, therefore I‚Äôm I can't decide my mind anymore and I need to write it down so that I can clearly see it, then no problem. <br><br>  But this is not all that I wanted to tell.  During the conversation, it turned out that my friend and I, at the most elementary level, consider it differently.  At the level of simple arithmetic.  I don‚Äôt remember exactly how he thought, so I‚Äôll explain with my own example so that you can understand what I‚Äôm talking about. <a name="habracut"></a>

      For example, I think, starting from the closest convenient number (by convention, I will call their reference numbers).  What I mean?  For me personally, some numbers are considered easier than others.  For example, 7 + 3 is considered easier for me than 7 + 5, so when I consider the value of the expression 7 + 5, I conditionally divide the top five into 3 and 2, add to seven-three, get 10 (reference number) and add to ten 2, getting 12. <br><br>  Another example: imagine that I need to add 96 to 74. The closest convenient number in this operation is for 100. Knowing that 96 = 100-4, it‚Äôs more convenient for me to add 100 to 74 and get 174 and take 174 from 174 and get 170. <br><br>  I consider expressions in which there is no such closest number, for example, 77 + 66, by digits.  That is, to 77, I will first add 6 dozen and get 137, and then to 137 I will add 6 units and I will get 143. (By the way to six seven, I will add, as in the first example, representing operation 7 + 6 through the nearest reference number, namely , number 14, and it's easier for me to count 7 + 6, like 7 + 7 (knowing that 6 = 7-1) and then subtract 1) <br><br>  In the course of this ‚Äústudy,‚Äù I came to the conclusion that my system of counting in my mind seems to me, to some extent, irrational, since  It requires additional auxiliary calculations, which load my ‚Äúoperational memory‚Äù, which leads to the fact that if the expression is a bit more complicated, I already need to write it down, because I cannot keep the intermediate calculations in my head.  For example, 12% of 84 I will search by multiplying 84 by 12, and then moving the comma two signs to the left.  To do this, in my mind I will imagine a column in which, considering the second line, I will forget the first one and these 12% will most likely decide with an error. <br><br>  And now my friends, my question to you.  What do you think at the elementary level?  How fast do you think?  How are you doing with the oral account?  And who has them well, please share with the algorithm, how do you do these calculations in your mind? <br><br>  Well, already philosophical questions: Do you think it is possible to significantly develop the skill of a quick oral account, or is it such a mindset and it is either there or it isn‚Äôt, and if it‚Äôs training, it‚Äôs insignificant?  And in principle: how do you think, how much, in general, is it critical for a programmer to be able / not to be able to quickly count in the mind? <br><br>  Share, friends, in the comments your thoughts on this matter. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206404/</a></p>
