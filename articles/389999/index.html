Hammock for a cat <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/d9">for $ 5.23 *</a> </h2><br>  Make a profit for your pets (yes, because such an invention is quite suitable not only for cats, but also for small dogs).  Warmly, comfortably, reminds of the true roots of the beast, and also allows you to get rid of the mews-shriek orgy and, possibly, save a few slippers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/098/b88/a5f/098b88a5f3869742292ebe598c0ca923.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  4. Finger drum kit <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/da">for $ 11.45 *</a> </h2><br>  If you dreamed of becoming a real drummer, but today you are working in a completely different field, forgetting to think about the world tour, you can still return!  All you need is a little ambition, your fingers and the drum set (and no complaints from the neighbors about the noise). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/305/f1e/27d/305f1e27d1c72d64d12e13313281f3e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  5. A mug that loves to make a coffee beating <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/db">for $ 9.99 *</a> </h2><br>  Throw away all the teaspoons as unnecessary.  The mug itself will stir everything up (due to the presence of a special mechanism working on simple finger batteries) - all that remains is to enjoy the taste of your coffee.  The secret of a happy morning is open! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb1/823/5d5/eb18235d593c899eb3377321d2e357e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  6. Alarm clock that can be shot <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/dc">for $ 19.09 *</a> </h2><br>  Perhaps your ascent will not be so painful if you carry out a routine and very unpleasant process of ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù, like a secret agent.  To silence the alarm clock, be accurate and shoot straight into the "heart" of the target. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/21b/480/103/21b480103e99f5465357fe97bc6c89fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  7. Stick a mirror on the wall <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/dd">for $ 2.94 *</a> </h2><br>  Many horror stories tell about mirrors.  For example, that it is impossible to look at the broken one, and you can still get hurt.  Not!  The Chinese came up with a 3D sticker in the form of a mosaic, which will allow you to create a mirror surface wherever you want! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd2/83b/0d4/fd283b0d4d179ea4275a3b6e00d3ff84.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  8. Ice cream machine - not a luxury <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/dr">for $ 65 *</a> </h2><br>  If a car is not a luxury, but a means of transportation, then an ice cream machine is a means of saving a person from the heat, as well as from a million troubles, because ice cream works wonders is a proven fact.  Just offer the device the fruits that you have, and it will do the sweet magic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/991/fc1/b9a/991fc1b9a59aab96e7f1391856b5dca7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  9. Organizer for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/de">Remotes for $ 11.95 *</a> </h2><br>  How many remotes do you have at home?  Gone off account and instead of the TV turn on the air conditioner, or lose everything at once together?  The Chinese are again in a hurry to the rescue - a convenient organizer.  Everything is in its place, the nerve cells are no longer wasted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b8/adc/723/7b8adc7236e05fc54273459f0bcee861.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  10. Reading is light!  Bookstore <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/df">for $ 2.56 *</a> </h2><br>  Amazing backlight for the book will allow you to read when you want it.  Even if a zombie apocalypse comes, and the electricity is switched off everywhere, you can spend some time to finish reading what you started with passion. <br><br><h2>  11. Be with you cotton candy <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/dg">for $ 47.99 *</a> </h2><br>  Stylish and extremely useful apparatus for creating cotton candy at home.  Childhood dreams come true.  Quickly, simply, inexpensively, and do not be surprised if a line of friends who are also eager for cotton are lined up for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c6/cc7/357/7c6cc7357b69fe2f72fc6855ba9e49c0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  12. Dust has no chance.  Purifying Lizun <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/dh">for $ 1.69 *</a> </h2><br>  If you still think that only a rag, a brush or, in extreme cases, Freken Bok can cope with dust, then you are mistaken.  Dust can do nothing against ... gel.  In this case, you get bonuses in the form of a pleasant smell, no damage to surfaces, as well as free time that you can spend on what you want.  Upgrade the good old lizunov with benefits for society. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c35/afb/623/c35afb6236436afab9d4a09e904591ea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  13. What is common between pizza, omelettes and toast?  Pizza-Cake-Cookies-Delalka <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/di">for $ 89.99 *</a> </h2><br>  They are similar in that they can be cooked in this typewriter.  By the way, and not only they.  In general, it fries, and soars, and bakes, so the whole range of dishes to list is simply impossible.  You get a versatile cook in the kitchen at a ridiculous price.  Thank you, residents of China! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/652/b36/28f/652b3628f9ba918035bda0e089afd236.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  14. "The House That Jackup Cheated" <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/dq">for $ 635 *</a> </h2><br>  This item on the list is a relative trifle for your own home.  Apartments are not cheap now, cottages are also, but the Chinese have come up with the ideal solution for those who do not want to start with a mortgage or simply want to expand the list of their real estate.  An inflatable bubble tent, which is still quite voluminous, with a certain amount of imagination is quite capable of replacing the whole house.  So the property in the end is still more movable.  That does not change his genius.  Introverts will appreciate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fbd/773/418/fbd773418aaa80350a7e83ace727f2d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>
<h2>  15. A pianist is not born.  Piano Gloves <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/dk">for $ 18.99</a> * </h2><br>  Want to play the piano on the ... table?  No problem!  And on a fallen tree?  And again - yes!  How is this possible?  Piano gloves from our Chinese friends will give you this super ability.  Any surface is now transformed into keys.  They have a built-in speaker, 8 instrumental sounds are offered at once, together with the same number of background rhythms.  You will be delighted, as 6 demo songs are attached to all this magnificence.  The sound is not long in coming. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c11/ef5/990/c11ef59903d156384f4ab75e1d6d123e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, this is not all the interesting things that can be found in China.
