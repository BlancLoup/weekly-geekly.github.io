  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Instructions for registration of LLC with one founder</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f61/16b/7a7/f6116b7a7efc4e03be017d6bd77bbe6c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>  Hello!  I must say, the article is not advertising.  I just want to share my experience! <br>  I decided to organize my business - a regional Internet agency.  Immediately there was a question about the formalization of its activities.  After some deliberation and weighing all the pros and cons, it was decided to register the LLC. <br>  But how to register it?  Use the services of a company for the registration of legal entities, or do you do it yourself? <br>  The registration of a legal entity "turnkey" in the city of Chelyabinsk costs about 8-10 thousand rubles, plus the cost of paying the state fee.  At the initial stage of the business, these are significant expenses, so I decided that I could manage it myself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having started studying the information on the tax website ( <a href="http://nalog.ru/">nalog.ru</a> is the official all-Russian portal), everything became clear: fill out forms, make a decision to create an LLC, a charter in 2 copies, make photocopies of your passport (just in case, like in state structures, photocopies of documents ) we pay the state duty (4000 rub.) and give everything to the tax. <br>  It‚Äôs quite simple at first glance, but I didn‚Äôt let go of the thought that if I didn‚Äôt design it out correctly, I would lose the paid state duty. <br>  I began to look for samples to fill out and read the forums, then I came across the paperwork service for registering a legal entity - regberry.ru <br>  The service turned out to be intuitive, and the most important thing here is to prepare the entire package of documents for free. <br>  And now directly about the design.

      <b>Instructions for registration Ltd.</b> <br><ol><li>  Register on the website <a href="http://regberry.ru/">regberry.ru</a> </li><li>  We enter the site under your username and password, choose the registration Ltd. </li><li>  We carry out all steps - we fill in forms.  Be careful when filling!  Enter the data from the passport in the same way as it is written in the passport (not Chelyabinsk, but the city of Chelyabinsk). </li><li>  Download the finished package of documents - zip-archive.  There will also be instructions for further actions (everything would be fine, but the instructions are a bit inaccurate). </li><li>  We print all the documents and check again.  As I wrote earlier, everything should be as in a passport (see point 3). </li><li>  <b>As a result, we have the following documents: the completed Form P11001 - 1 copy, the Charter - 2 copies, the Decision of the sole founder - 2 copies, the Statement on the transition to the simplified tax system.</b>  As for the transition to the simplified tax system - it is better to submit an application immediately, so that later not to forget about it. </li><li>  We are stitching both copies of the charter.  How to do it - watch the video on Youtube. </li><li>  If the ‚ÄúDecision of the sole founder‚Äù is on you on several sheets (one copy), then it must also be flashed. </li><li>  We pay the state duty.  At the time of this writing - 4000 rub.  I paid for it through Sberbank Online. ‚Äù  If you pay as well - be sure to go to the branch of Sberbank after that and put a stamp on the payment receipt. </li><li>  Make a photocopy of the document on the ownership of the premises, or the lease agreement, or any other document confirming your belonging to the premises, which will be indicated as the legal address. </li><li>  Do not sign any documents (except the list on the stitched documents) - upon delivery they will tell you where and what to sign. </li><li>  Just in case, make a photocopy of your passport - they like to ask her in government agencies. </li><li>  We make an appointment at the tax office.  This can be done on the above site nalog.ru </li><li>  We arrive at the appointed day in the tax service department and hand over the documents.  You are in possession of documents from points 6, 9, 10. When you hand over documents, do not hesitate and ask to check documents for errors (this helped me). </li><li>  You have passed the documents and received a receipt for their acceptance.  You have also been assigned a date for receiving the documents (usually, after 5 working days). </li><li>  On the appointed day we collect documents (you should have a passport and a receipt).  You will be given: an extract from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities (10 days from the date of issue), a certificate of registration, a certificate of registration.  You just give the documents and everything.  Congratulations, you have issued an LLC! </li><li>  In the near future you will receive a letter from the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Letter from Rosstat.  It is needed for registration of the current account.  You can not wait for him, I never came.  After a couple of working days after receiving the documents, call the local Rosstat office (look at 2GIS or the official website of the Rosstat for the phone number and address); they will explain to you where to find and download the necessary documents on the website of your department. </li><li>  Make a current account.  Documents required for registration can be found on the bank‚Äôs website where you decide to open an account. </li><li>  Share capital.  At the time of this writing, the minimum share capital is 10,000 rubles.  You can make it only in cash (before it was possible with property), within 4 months from the date of registration. </li><li>  That's all - you are the director of your own company. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  You can make your own LLC yourself without being afraid of losing a lot of time and money. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292630/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292630/</a></p>
