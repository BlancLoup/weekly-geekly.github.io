Now drop the skin and the sharp smell of beer and replace bikers with programmers and entrepreneurs.  So five years ago, the first tech-hub "Key" appeared in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  Later, the "institution" moved to Moscow.  On the territory of the capital there are <a href="https://thekey.space/locations">five sites</a> where freelancers, start-ups and whole studios gather.  The spaces are located in the historical buildings of Moscow: for example, the ‚ÄúKey Arma‚Äù is located on the territory of the gas-cylinder plant ‚ÄúArma‚Äù.  Moreover, coworking designers tried to preserve the unique atmosphere of each building.  There are also coworkings on Silk, on Danilovskaya Manufactory, on Patriarch's Ponds, on Trekhgorny Manufactory. <br><br>  At these sites, you can work alone, book a meeting room, or rent an entire office (the minimum rental period is 1 month).  If you need to hold your event, the ‚ÄúKey‚Äù team will take care of the technical part - it will adjust the sound, light, video and feed the guests. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/strelkainrussian/">Strelka Institute</a> </h2><br>  <b>Address:</b> <a href="https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/%3Fmode%3Dpoi%26ll%3D37.609872%252C55.742409%26z%3D19%26poi%255Buri%255D%3Dymapsbm1%253A%252F%252Forg%253Foid%253D1058448426%26poi%255Bpoint%255D%3D37.609272%252C55.742601%26ol%3Dgeo%26ouri%3Dymapsbm1%253A%252F%252Fgeo%253Fll%253D37.609557%25252C55.742243">Bersenevskaya Embankment, 14, p.5</a> <br><br>  Strelka Institute is a creative educational cluster with an experimental approach to learning.

Here you can organize a business meeting or present a new product surrounded by stucco and baroque curtains, seating guests in antique chairs.  There are music and poetry evenings, film screenings and exhibitions of paintings, but you can just get together with colleagues to discuss business issues, for example, at a round table in the <a href="https://korsakov.club/halls/">Bay window</a> . <br><br>  Of course, for all the guests here: smart Wi-Fi, tea, coffee, cookies and additional things like a projector, whiteboard or microphone. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <a href="http://flacon.ru/business/coworking/flacon-coworking/">Flacon</a> </h2><br>  <b>Address:</b> <a href="https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/%3Fmode%3Dsearch%26ll%3D37.585089%252C55.805290%26z%3D16%26poi%255Buri%255D%3Dymapsbm1%253A%252F%252Forg%253Foid%253D1058448426%26poi%255Bpoint%255D%3D37.609272%252C55.742601%26text%3D%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB.%2520%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%252C%2520%25D0%25B4.36%252C%2520%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580.2%26sll%3D37.633014%252C55.781215%26sspn%3D0.019655%252C0.005962%26ol%3Dbiz%26oid%3D1732662883">st.</a>  <a href="https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/%3Fmode%3Dsearch%26ll%3D37.585089%252C55.805290%26z%3D16%26poi%255Buri%255D%3Dymapsbm1%253A%252F%252Forg%253Foid%253D1058448426%26poi%255Bpoint%255D%3D37.609272%252C55.742601%26text%3D%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB.%2520%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%252C%2520%25D0%25B4.36%252C%2520%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580.2%26sll%3D37.633014%252C55.781215%26sspn%3D0.019655%252C0.005962%26ol%3Dbiz%26oid%3D1732662883">Bolshaya Novodmitrovskaya, d.36, p.2</a> <br><br>  There are a lot of designers and programmers in Flacon, because in this co-working they love creative in all its manifestations.  ‚ÄúDo what you want!‚Äù Is the motto of ‚ÄúFlacon‚Äù. <br><br>  In addition to the standard workplace and Wi-Fi, residents can go to a restaurant, spa salon or swimming pool, play volleyball in the summer and go ice skating in the winter - all this is located on the territory of the Design Factory. <br><br>  In the same area is located coworking <a href="https://starthub.ru/new/">START HUB</a> ( <a href="https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/%3Fmode%3Dsearch%26ll%3D37.586221%252C55.804410%26z%3D17%26poi%255Buri%255D%3Dymapsbm1%253A%252F%252Forg%253Foid%253D1058448426%26poi%255Bpoint%255D%3D37.609272%252C55.742601%26ol%3Dbiz%26oid%3D1315161333">map</a> ).  You can come here to work even at three in the morning, at least at six in the morning - the site is open around the clock.  There are three halls with fixed seats, a kitchen and two meeting rooms - the total area of ‚Äã‚Äã400 squares.  Residents say that START HUB is like a large loft apartment, and the atmosphere is like in the TV series Friends.

You can rent a workplace, mini-office, meeting room, conference room, use business services and drink all the coffee in the kitchen.  <a href="https://coworking-start.ru/price">Tariffs are</a> nicer here than in Moscow. <br><br>  For teams, beginners and students discounts and promotions.

But this is all already familiar.  The differences between this space, I would call free underground parking for residents, a lounge area with a PlayStation and a punching bag, as well as ‚Äúbundled‚Äù equipment like MacBooks and audio systems. <br><br>  Since the ‚ÄúAtmosphere‚Äù is located on the sixth floor of the ‚ÄúRIO‚Äù shopping and entertainment center, guests of the co-working just need to go down the elevator to watch a movie or eat in a restaurant after work. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.space-u.info/">Space-u</a> </h2><br>  <b>Address:</b> <a href="https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/%3Fll%3D37.636193%252C55.744711%26z%3D19%26mode%3Dpoi%26poi%255Buri%255D%3Dymapsbm1%253A%252F%252Forg%253Foid%253D130673091614%26poi%255Bpoint%255D%3D37.635904%252C55.744787">st.</a>  <a href="https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/%3Fll%3D37.636193%252C55.744711%26z%3D19%26mode%3Dpoi%26poi%255Buri%255D%3Dymapsbm1%253A%252F%252Forg%253Foid%253D130673091614%26poi%255Bpoint%255D%3D37.635904%252C55.744787">Sadovnicheskaya, 42, p. 6</a> <br><br>  Space-U spaces can be liked by those who prefer to adjust everything for themselves: here you can move furniture and adjust the lighting as it is convenient.

In Deworkacy Red October you can look at the Moscow River and the monument to Peter I during the breaks (or work).  Most of all, in my opinion, this platform is suitable for startups or freelancers. <br><br>  The Deworkacy Izvestia is located in the building of the former Izvestia newspaper, so it can become the second home for media projects or those involved in advertising. <br><br>  Corporate Innovations Hub is perhaps the most multifunctional platform: here you can rent one of the many ordinary offices or organize yourself a virtual one.  There is also a library with a fireplace, a sleeping area, rooms for pitch sessions, telephone booths, a patio and a large conference room for 120 guests.  The technology hub occupies three floors, so it will be convenient to work here for both small teams and those who have decided to hold a large-scale conference or hackathon. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tpstrogino/">Technopark "Strogino</a> </h2><br>  <b>Address:</b> <a href="https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/%3Fll%3D37.392167%252C55.794447%26z%3D16%26mode%3Dsearch%26ol%3Dbiz%26oid%3D45758072927">st.</a>  <a href="https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/%3Fll%3D37.392167%252C55.794447%26z%3D16%26mode%3Dsearch%26ol%3Dbiz%26oid%3D45758072927">Tvardovskogo, d.8, p. 1</a> <br><br>  Technopark "STROGINO" will allow you to go through all stages of business development in one place.
