  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Math on the Internet - harmless fun or universal evil</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More and more often in RuNet, messages with obscene expressions appear at every step.  Moreover, if earlier it was possible to meet it mostly only in private correspondence, now even some official sites do not stop with obscenities. <br><br>  It is believed that the use of swear words can attract attention and increase site traffic.  This is partly true.  Take the same huyandex.com - a very visited resource that is not only not afraid to use the mat in its name, but is not afraid of anyone at all, posting pornographic materials on the site and materials that violate other copyrights. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Although, in this case, it is not entirely clear what exactly brought popularity to this resource, an abusive word in the title or a similarity of the name to a well-known search engine. <br><br>  Ultimately, this is not so important.  It is only important that the use of obscene expressions and materials of a pornographic nature, as a magnet attracts users. <br>  The question is which users attract such resources.  And here the answer is quite obvious.  Mostly the visitors of such resources are degrading adults and teenagers who have not fully developed their psyche.

      The first ones do not really interest me, since they are completely voluntarily spending their time absorbing this poisoned information.  Sorry for our younger generation.  What they become, realizing that the mat is not only a sign of the degradation of society, but also a way to attract attention. <br><br>  In addition, this problem does not just exist, but grows like a snowball.  Teens are getting older, creating their portals, blogs, accounts in social networks and also starting to curse, like shoemakers (no offense will be told to representatives of this respected profession). <br><br>  Meanwhile, scientists studying the influence of obscene expressions on a person came to the conclusion that the mat is not as harmless as it may seem at first glance. <br><br>  One of the first who decided not only to talk about it, but also to defend a scientific thesis on this topic, was Ivan Belyavsky.  For several years, he and his assistants conducted research for two groups of people.  One of which often used obscene language in its expressions, and the second did not use such words in its everyday life. <br><br>  Long-term studies have shown that "matershinnikov" very quickly appeared age-related changes and many chronic diseases.  While in the second group, on the contrary, the condition of the participants was 5-15 years younger than their official age. <br><br>  Along with this, scientists of the Krasnoyarsk Center for Medical Technology have proven the beneficial effect of the Good Vocabulary on the human body.  Their own methods, which they began to apply, not only raised the patients' mood, but also had a beneficial effect on the blood composition and cellular immunity. <br><br>  There have been a lot of similar studies, and all of them proved the following: the use of swear words negatively affects not only the health of a person, but also his mental and spiritual state, and the use of kind, positive words definitely benefits people! <br><br>  Ultimately, you decide whether to use a mat in everyday life and whether to absorb information containing obscene expressions, because you are responsible for your life.  Just remember that using the mat in your speech, you harm the people around you. <br><br>  The word in human life plays a very important role.  Nothing hurts a person like a word.  Say good words and the world will be better! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114995/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114995/</a></p>
