Our language has passed the coveted edition of "1.0".  Rust is stable, the ecosystem is growing by leaps and bounds, and improvements are ripening in each new issue.  It's time to expand the audience! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Who are we </h2><br><h4>  Mikhail Pankov </h4><br>  System programmer.  Developed a compiler, hypervisor, operating systems.

      ‚ÄúI believe that Rust is a huge breakthrough in programming.  The language combines modern practice, reliability and an incredibly delicate execution environment.  It‚Äôs time to move in system programming, and Go, Haskell, and scripting languages ‚Äã‚Äãon the web. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Listochkin Andrey </h4><br>  Full-stack developer.  He has been developing a debugger for the language, browser, cancer diagnostic system and numerous web applications. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI write in different languages ‚Äã‚Äã- JavaScript, Ruby, Java.  I always knew that I had the opportunity to create native extensions for them, but I never dared to do this in practice.  For me, Rust discovered this opportunity.  Expressiveness combined with reliability is what attracts me to the language, and today I use it with great pleasure. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Denis Kolodin </h4><br>  Developed stock robots, online broadcasting systems, led the team supporting the federal transit complex. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI worked with a large number of programming languages, but I felt‚Äú Wow! ‚ÄùOnly twice: when I learned Java and Python: I felt that this was a breakthrough, and indeed the Java platform became the de facto standard in Enterprise, and Python gave us technology from Google, YouTube and a lot of web startups.  Now I feel this feeling again: this time working with the Rust language.  It is created by a truly large community.  The quality and speed of development, I am sure, will make it the most demanded system programming language for the next 10 years, and it may give us a new OS: fast, freezes and easy to work out. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  Manifesto </h2><br><ul><li>  We believe that Rust deserves the attention of developers. </li><li>  We strive to unite Russian-speaking programmers in this wonderful language who are in Russia and not only. </li><li>  We want people to know about Rust and use Rust. </li></ul><br><h2>  What do we have </h2><br><h4>  <a href="http://rustycrate.ru/">Site</a> </h4><br>  He works on <code>jekyll</code> .  Pages are Markdown files.  His repository is <a href="">here</a> . <br><br>  Home site - this is a blog feed.  You can <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/rustycrate/yMtS">subscribe to it</a> . <br><br>  Writing to this blog is very simple - make a pull request to our repository by adding the Markdown file in jekyll format to the _posts directory. <br><br>  Publications have comments.  The form for writing comments is at the bottom of the page.  Comments work on Disqus. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://kgv.github.io/rust_book_ru/">Book</a> </h4><br>  Fully translated into Russian language book about Rust - ‚ÄúThe Rust Programming Language‚Äù - from the authors of the language. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://forum.rustycrate.ru/">Forum</a> </h4><br>  He works at Discourse.  Registration is free.  Designed for any discussions about Rust in the Russian-speaking environment. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://gitter.im/ruRust/general">Chat</a> </h4><br>  This is a gitter room.  You can join by having an account on GitHub.  While this channel - the main, and is intended for any conversations in our community. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://ru.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust">Stackoverflow</a> </h4><br>  Russian version of a known resource - and it has a tag ¬´rust¬ª.  If your question is purely technical, it has a specific answer or solution, then you should ask it here. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://rustycrate.ru/in-progress.html">In work</a> </h4><br>  This is a list of resources that someone has taken to translate (or even develop from scratch!).  If you want to coordinate with the community, write to Pankov Mikhail in chat, email or anywhere else.  He will add you to the list.  Contacts can be taken - correctly, on the page "Contacts"!  And it is better to immediately pull request with a change to this page. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://rustycrate.ru/contacts.html">Contacts</a> </h4><br>  List of contacts.  For now, it is simply in the format "string of text - mail".  Again, if you want to add yourself, don't stop at nothing! <br><br><hr><br>  Construction and decoration are not finished yet, so you may stumble upon shortcomings or bugs.  Please do not be silent - write about them to the address of Michael Pankov.  It can be found on the Contacts page. <br><br>  If you want to help, we will be happy to receive your questions, ideas, or suggestions for concrete help. <br><br>  You can also look at the <a href="https://github.com/ruRust/rustycrate.ru/issues">problem</a> .  If you want to do something - write in the comments in the task that you are doing this.  We will wait for pull requests! <br><br><h2>  rules </h2><br>  Our community is still small, but some rules need to be set right away.  There are only 3 of them and they are very simple: <br><br><ul><li>  Do not insult others.  Be polite and do not offend interlocutors.  Publications or comments containing insults will be mercilessly deleted. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Speak on topic.  We do not need publications that are not related to Rust or garbage in the chat.  Again, until the content is deleted. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  No need to spam.  Nobody likes spam.  Regarding punishment - well, you already understood. </li></ul><br><h2>  Waiting for you! </h2><br>  We hope that your stay on our resources will be pleasant and useful. <br><br>  How about going to the <a href="https://gitter.im/ruRust/general">chat</a> and saying ‚Äúhello‚Äù? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/273561/">https://habr.com/ru/post/273561/</a></p>
