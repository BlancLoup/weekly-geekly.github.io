  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The bill on the urgent removal of illegal posts from social networks passed the first reading in the State Duma</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On April 12, the State Duma adopted in the first reading a bill against fake news on social networks and adopted amendments to current legislation, which provide for fines for disseminating false information in the amount of up to 50 million rubles for legal entities.  Roskomnadzor will be able to require social networks to delete such publications within 24 hours. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wi/qx/px/wiqxpxnndi9q5_gzwhjsroikado.jpeg"></div><br>  <i>The bill was introduced by United Russia deputies Sergei Boyarsky and Andrei Alshevsky.</i>  <i>On the photo - Sergey Boyarsky</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Owners of social networks are under the obligation ‚Äúto create a representation on the territory of the Russian Federation, to restrict access to or remove, according to a user of a public network, the information disseminated therein, which is clearly aimed at promoting war, inciting national, racial or religious hatred and enmity, and other information, for distribution of which criminal or administrative liability is provided, within a day from the moment of receipt of the said application. ‚Äù  In addition, now social networks will have to keep a register of user complaints and provide it to Roskomnadzor on demand - it looks like they will have to create a real virtual ‚ÄúBook of complaints and suggestions‚Äù. <br><br>  The text of the draft law on introducing amendments to the Federal Law "On Information, Information Technologies and Information Protection" was <a href="http://sozd.parlament.gov.ru/bill/223849-7">published on the portal CERD</a> .  All organizers of services created for receiving, transmitting and (or) processing messages that are used by more than two million people in Russia will have to create a representative office in the country.

      Upon request, it will be necessary to remove such information during the day, which ‚Äúis clearly aimed at propagating war, inciting national, racial or religious hatred and enmity, inaccurate and (or) discrediting the honor and dignity of another person or his reputation which provides for criminal or administrative liability. " <br><br>  Moreover, the social network will have to remove copies of such information.  It is unclear how this will be done in practice: just getting rid of the reposted VKontakte is one thing, but in court they can accuse the social network operator of distributing a screenshot of the post or its excerpts, randomly found somewhere after a day. <br><br>  Clause 5 of the article provides for the very ‚Äúcomplaint book‚Äù: an electronic form must be available to users around the clock, in which they could send a complaint to publications whose topics are indicated above.  Quarterly will have to report on these complaints.  If the social network does not fulfill the requirements - it can be fined. <br><br>  In drafting the law, deputies were guided by the practice of other countries.  As an example, they cited Germany, where the fine for placing illegal content ranges from 500 thousand to 5 million euros. <br><br>  The need to introduce such a bill was motivated by the situation around the dissemination of information about the number of people killed in a shopping center in Kemerovo in March 2018, which differed from the official data.  As <a href="http://tass.ru/obschestvo/5118143">the</a> head of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, Information Technologies and Communications, Leonid Levin, <a href="http://tass.ru/obschestvo/5118143">notes</a> , the initiative needs to be improved by the second reading. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Note</b> : When commenting on this material, please follow the rules of Geektimes.
