There are discoveries.  That is, everything in the world already exists, you just need to open another secret.  The whole essence of things is contained in them.  Hence, the secret of the Ideal System cannot be invented, it can only be opened.  In this article, I, using the esoteric method of cognition, will try to discover what is the ‚ÄúIdeal System‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>Warning: the topic is "unscientific" and difficult to understand.</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Many people in their work are engaged in the creation of something.  Often the result of human labor is a system.  Simple or complex, but always Technical or Information System.  But man is not perfect.  It is logical that an imperfect creator has imperfect creations.  Someone is better, someone is worse, but it is always very far from being perfect. <br><br>  Yes, man is not perfect, but there is an Ideal Creator (You can call him whatever you want - God, Vishnu or the Supreme Cosmic Mind, this does not change the essence).  And if the Creator is perfect, then his creations are perfect.  Consequently, we already see examples of Ideal Systems around us.  It remains only to make a discovery. <br><br><h4>  Selection of Systems for Analysis </h4><br>  There are many systems to the creation of which man is not involved.  As an example of an Ideal System, I will take the most obvious one ‚Äî a living being.  I think any living thing can be called the Ideal System.  But let this term be used to describe the theoretical object of study.  Therefore, in order not to confuse the object under study with an example, I suggest using the term ‚ÄúBiological System‚Äù ( <b>BS</b> ).  For special clarity, let the example of the Biological System be Man.  For comparison, choose Technical and Information Systems created by man.  As a technical system ( <b>TS</b> ), we take the car.  And as an Information System ( <b>IS</b> ) - an Internet resource, site. <br><br><h4>  Imaginary contradiction </h4><br>  Probably, someone has already paid attention to the apparent contradiction in the given statements.  If the Creator is perfect, then his creations are perfect.  Man is imperfect, and his creations are likewise imperfect.  But man is created by the Creator, which means he must be perfect, but the opposite is asserted.  On the face of a contradiction.  But this is only if you look superficially and not reach a subtle understanding.  Man is made perfect in its essence.  He is like the Creator.  But it is an autonomous, self-developing system, which independently acquires new qualities, developing or degrading.  What a person is and <b>what</b> he is is two different things.  I do not want to go into these subtleties, and I can not probably.  I just want to emphasize that there really is no contradiction. <br><br><h4>  What is the ideal system? </h4><br>  The ideal system consists of three main parts.  Surely everything is much more complicated, but so far I have not discovered more. <br><br><h4>  Part 1. Interface </h4><br>  An interface is a part of a system that determines the characteristics of its physical or informational interaction with other systems.  That is, using the interface, we can manage the system or collect information about it. <br><br><h5>  Interface: Technical System </h5><br>  Interfaces of the car are its controls - steering wheel, pedals, levers.  It is obvious.  There are still sensors and signal lights.  This is a human interface.  But most of the interface is built by itself.  By the appearance and sound of the car, we can determine its approximate weight (inertia in driving, center of gravity), driving performance (in what road conditions this car can be operated), approximate power, age, and a lot of information. <br><br><h5>  Interface: Information System </h5><br>  The situation is about the same as with the vehicle.  But there is a difference.  In the Technical System, part of the interface is built independently, as it is connected with a cause-effect chain (the suspension is broken - a knock is audible).  But in the IP interface is not built by the system itself, and the whole is created by man.  Therefore, almost all IP interfaces are far from perfect.  This is a big problem for all users. <br><br><h5>  Interface: Biological System </h5><br>  The human interface is very rich.  There is an incredible number of ways to influence it.  Just by the way he walks, talks, reacts, looks, and so on, you can collect a huge amount of information about him.  Unlike IP, everything here is honest - everything is as it is, everything is justified.  If we eliminate the imperfection of our perception of information and analyze it correctly, then the conclusions can always be drawn correctly.  Because the BS interface is perfect, not created by man. <br><br>  <u>Summary:</u> <br>  The interface is important, but not the most important part of the system.  A reasonable person will not buy a car just because of the color, and we do not choose the circle of friends because of the height or color of the eyes.  The interface is important at the time of the first acquaintance with a new object, when we have no information about it.  It is also needed to analyze the current state of the system and interact with it.  But the interface is only an access guide to the most important thing.  It is important, but not primary. <br><br><h4>  Part 2. Mechanism of functioning </h4><br>  A complex system is usually closed, autonomous.  It means that she should have a mechanism of work that allows her independent, ‚Äúindependent‚Äù existence.  Independent conditional explanation below. <br><br><h5>  Mechanism of operation: Technical System </h5><br>  The car has a functioning system - engine, transmission, electronics.  This is what enables the car to work.  But this system is not independent.  She needs food in the form of fuel, and maintenance.  Its lifetime is limited by wear.  Unless of course to change everything that breaks, then theoretically you can maintain its existence forever.  The functional part is an important component of the system.  For people smarter than those who choose a car by its appearance, this part of the system is more important. <br><br><h5>  Mechanism of operation: Information System </h5><br>  As well as for the TS, for the Information System, its functional part is very important.  But she has an exceptional feature - independence.  We don‚Äôt take hardware into account, because in reality it does not belong to IP, but is only an integral part of a more global web server system.  By itself, IP is an abstract information structure, born in thoughts, and only decorated in files. <br><br><h5>  Mechanism of functioning: Biological System </h5><br>  The human body is perfection itself.  Just think how much work it does.  It removes oxygen from the air, splits food, regulates temperature, fights infections, regenerates tissues.  All its complexity is not open to science, even for a small part.  Why are there science, even we ourselves are not able to correctly use the possibilities of the perfect tool given to us.  Not understanding all his perfection, from ignorance, we spoil junk food and various poisons.  Why then no one fills diesel into his Mazda.  Man is not capable of creating anything as complex as this is a fact.  The body, as well as the Technical System, being material, also requires food and care.  But if in the car we can change the failed units, then in the body it turns out with great difficulty.  There can be no talk of a person creating a system of similar complexity. <br><br><h4>  Everything? </h4><br>  So, we have considered two components of the systems: functional and interface.  With regards to IP and TC, anyone will say that this is enough.  Yes, the machine works, the site too.  All right, what else do you want?  But if we consider the biological system, then what do we get with only these two parts?  We will get a corpse.  Well, or at best, zombies.  So what else is there in the BS that makes it live?  It has something for which these two parts of the system exist. <br><br><h4>  Part 3. Soul </h4><br><h5>  Soul: Biological System </h5><br>  I will not give a variety of scientific studies regarding the study of the existence of the human Soul.  There are many of them, and I do not know them.  I only know that something must distinguish a dead person from a living person.  Moreover, considering a person as a system consisting of these three parts, then think about what determines your attitude towards another person?  Why do you love your friends?  For a smooth posture or manner of pronunciation (interface)?  Or for a good digestive system and the ability to pull up a hundred times (the functional part)?  I think that obviously neither for the one nor the other.  It means there is something third in them, which is much more important than their functional features and interfaces. <br><br><h5>  Soul: Information System </h5><br>  And can the site have a soul?  If it cannot, then only the first two parts remain.  But why do we love or dislike certain sites?  Take for example Habr.  Why do we love him?  For the interface?  Yes, not bad, but in general, nothing special.  For functionality?  The most common blog ... Quality, but still, just not enough.  And take Bashorg.  There is nothing at all in him, but how good he was in his early years!  Why then are these sites so loved? <br><br>  But what then can be called the soul of the Information System?  Complex issue.  I do not think that this can be expressed in precise formulations, because it is still beyond the scope of understanding by Consciousness.  Therefore, in the matter of creating the soul of the Information System, I suppose you can trust only your inner feeling, intuition (or soul).  Creativity of this level is available to man so far only unconsciously.  This is called "to inject the soul."  They also say "done with the soul."  I believe that to create an IP soul, there must be an idea, the meaning of the existence of a system.  But more importantly - the love of what you do.  The amount of love for the created system is the main criterion of the quality of her soul. <br><br>  In practice, the IP, in our example, the site, is rarely a completely without a soul.  The creator invests in his creation as much as he can and wants.  The quality of the nested and determines the quality of the Information System.  If the creator of the system did it only in order to get money, then it is natural that there will be no soul in it.  When a person is obsessed with the idea, the meaning of his work, and love for what he does, then truly outstanding projects are obtained. <br><br><h5>  Soul: Technical System </h5><br>  I really like Top Gear.  Who looks, knows that they have a special relationship to cars.  They always look deeper, trying to feel the soul of the car.  And it always comes first.  Its performance and design are less important.  The soul of the vehicle is probably the same thing as for IP - the fact that its creator invests in it.  If the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a car was to flood the market with cheap, fast-breaking cars, then naturally there can be no talk of a soul. <br><br>  <u>Summary:</u> <br>  Soul is necessary for the life of the System.  Not of existence, but of life.  Otherwise, it can not be perfect.  In fact, IP and TC rarely happen without a soul.  But the quality of the system as a whole depends on its quality. <br><br><h4>  Which part of the Ideal System is the most important? </h4><br>  To paraphrase Chekhov, one can say: Everything in the system should be fine.  But if we consider what is the cause, and what is the consequence, then of course, the most important thing in the system is its soul.  What is the soul - the system is like that, because everything begins with it (the soul). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d2/406/7d2/7d24067d25bc4769c1212054debfdbaf.jpg" align="right"><br><h4>  Generalizing </h4><br>  All systems have a common structure.  And assuming that a Technical or Information System can be simpler, and only the interface and the functional part are bypassed, it means to condemn this system to be incomplete, and therefore not ideal. <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  I do not claim the truth of my opinion.  The whole article is just food for the mind.  Each reader decides for himself whether or not to agree with the above.  But any criticism or comments will be glad. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127907/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127907/</a></p>
