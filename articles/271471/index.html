    <blockquote>  The number of Node.js modules (and other JavaScript libraries) added by users since 2010 has surpassed the entire Perl CPAN repository, which has been populating for the last 20 years. </blockquote><br>  Node.js appeared after Google released the JavaScript release of the V8 engine, which was conceived as a JavaScript interpreter for the Google Chrome browser.  Soon after opening the V8 source code, Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node.js, realized that the interpreter could be used to create a completely new concept of server-side JavaScript. <br><br>  Recently, the market witnessed the acquisition of several Node.js pioneers, including StrongLoop by IBM, FeedHenry by Red Hat, and Modulus by Progress Software. <br><br>  Experts in the IT industry note that a JavaScript-based scripting language is an indispensable tool for developing and delivering applications in modern companies. <br><br>  Node.js continues to evolve at almost unprecedented speed.  Over the past five years, developers have added over 190,000 modules for Node.js (and other JavaScript libraries).  This exceeds the entire Perl CPAN repository compiled over the course of 20 years and bypasses Java Maven Central, despite a smaller number of Node.js developers. <br><br>  What caused such popularity among enterprise developers, and can the CIO be sure that Node.js will be actively used for at least ten years? <br><br>  The ecosystem supporting Node.js modules around the kernel has experienced strong growth.  The Node community benefited greatly from the existence of the Node package manager (npmjs), which provides a central repository of common modules. <br><br>  This is a key part of the flexible and easy way to work with Node.js.  It allows each application to have the necessary modules in its own dependency tree.  Thus, each application can have its own set of modules, thus avoiding dependency conflicts with other applications. <br><br>  This flexible tool based on Node.js using the npmjs.org service has led to a significant increase in the number of common modules and to the fact that npmjs.org has become a repository not only for the server Node.js, but also for the client JavaScript modules. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7e/1cf/e7a/b7e1cfe7a9654961a8b81d9532eeb699.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  In September 2015, the central repository npm.js crossed the milestone of 2 billion downloads. </blockquote><br>  In the early stages of Node.js, companies like Netflix, Walmart, PayPal, Dow Jones and Groupon began using it.  They created internal teams that used Node using the ‚Äúdivide and conquer‚Äù approach: breaking up what used to be a rather ‚Äúmonolithic‚Äù approach to creating web services.  This allowed them to quickly develop and update solutions for various business areas and immediately deploy microservices in production. <br><br><h2>  Node.js becomes mainstream </h2><br>  Node.js is particularly well suited for companies with web-based infrastructure and mobile applications, in which backend they need to quickly introduce innovations, using an architecture built on microservices.  This includes organizations that may seem conservative, but are faced with the need to develop applications that are consistent with the rapid changes in the business world, while maintaining the stability and security of existing systems. <br><br>  These double demands led IT teams to change their way of thinking.  Almost all companies had to look for ways to quickly respond to requests for business software, while maintaining the current legacy code, which changes much less frequently.  Node.js is one of the tools for teams developing interaction systems, such as mobile solutions. <br><br>  Node.js is often praised for responding to corporate requests and allowing you to build applications with an API that can access the server side and large amounts of data in an easy and efficient manner.  Indeed, focusing on the reusable RESTful API as a more flexible way of building large-scale software architecture allowed Node.js to find its place. <br><br>  Node.js can significantly reduce application development time while maintaining the same functionality.  Back in the 1990s, John Ousterhout (John K. Ousterhout), who helped develop a meaningful scripting language and Tcl / Tk toolkit, argued that scripting programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãare inherently more productive than heavier ones, such as C or C ++. <br><br>  Compared to heavier stacks, application development with Node.js is faster, and with the development of the ecosystem, Node only accelerates.  This is the case when you should spend time searching for what is already in the Node community, and find out if you can reuse any of the common modules. <br><br>  Among developers, Node is treated very favorably and respected by specialists in this technology.  The cohesion of developers and their morale rise, if the IT structure of the organization has a team that works with Node.js.  This is perceived as an interesting and truly cool opportunity. <br><br>  Node.js is great for applications built on microservice architecture due to low CPU consumption, its computational power and efficient use of RAM.  This advantage is especially evident for tasks related to input / output costing operations rather than CPU usage, since the implementation of the Node.js execution model allows using ‚Äúeasy‚Äù parallelism based on a single execution flow model that does not require complicated techniques. parallel programming. <br><br>  By combining all of this - the way of thinking of programmers and the various technical advantages of an easy approach - companies get a new approach to solving IT problems with a team of developers who are motivated to solve them and armed with a high-speed set of tools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17c/8c8/fc5/17c8c8fc5aa7486f9930d42e72b7a455.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Future Node </h2><br>  Even the most conservative parts of the IT community now recognize that Node is rapidly growing.  It has a stable kernel that supports backward compatibility for most versions and the ability to run real-world solutions in major corporations on production. <br><br>  Last month, Node 4.0.0 was announced at NodeConf EU, and a rather tight release cycle.  The first Node release with a long support period (LTS) was scheduled for October, with subsequent releases every 12 months.  Each LTS release will be actively supported for 18 months and after that will go into support mode for another 12 months. <br><blockquote>  <em>From the translator: Node.js is really developing very actively: since the publication of the article (as it was on October 27), two more releases came out - LTS release 4.2.2, and after it ‚Äúnot LTS‚Äù 5.1.0.</em> </blockquote><br>  A long plan of support for enterprise developers gives a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich version of Node is safe to use for experimentation, and which - for deployment in production.  In addition, it reassures that the Node.js Foundation has an open management model. <br><br>  Despite the fact that Node does not seek to oust other programming languages, it will certainly take its place among the tools for developing corporate software for at least a decade.  Node has already shown itself to be promising for the development of the Internet of Things.  As for server solutions for web and mobile applications, Node is still strong. <br><br>  <i>Original: <a href="http://www.information-age.com/technology/applications-and-development/123460405/rise-nodejs-and-why-it-will-rule-enterprise-software-development-least-decade">http://www.information-age.com/technology/applications-and-development/123460405/rise-nodejs-and-why-it-will-rule-enterprise-software-development-least-decade</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271471/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271471/</a></p>
