The platform was launched in 2012.  Now the audience of the project has about one and a half million users.  Statistics on the results of the decisions of tasks by their users resource regularly publishes in the form of a rating for 50 countries. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.hackerrank.com/which-country-would-win-in-the-programming-olympics/">The HackerRank rating takes</a> into account tasks for the 15 most popular disciplines.  The most popular tasks concern various algorithms related to dynamic programming, big data analysis and other topics.  To solve such tasks, the user can work with any programming language.  In addition to algorithms, the top 3 popular tasks include data structure and programming tasks in Java.  Such tasks are performed by 9.1% and 9.3% of users, respectively.  All points of specialists in different countries are analyzed, after which the total score for each country from the participating in the rating is displayed.  The maximum number of points a country can get is 100. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/16f/dfd/18b/16fdfd18b70b5c905db06ea27d346e82.png"><br>  <em>The list of topics that are most popular among users of the platform</em>

      HackerRank reports show that the best programmers do not live in the United States.  And not in India, although here the number of developers is constantly increasing.  The best of the best live in China and Russia.  Chinese specialists are traditionally strong in math, functional programming and data processing.  The Chinese received the maximum number of points - 100. Russian programmers, who received 99.9% of the points, dominate in the field of algorithms (about 40% of users of the HackerRank platform try to solve tasks in this field).  But India and the United States are located only in 31st and 28th places, respectively.  At the same time, 10% of users work with Java tasks and data structure.  The least popular are tasks for security and distributed systems.  In addition to China and Russia, Poland, Switzerland, Hungary, Japan, Taiwan, France, the Czech Republic, and Italy were in the top 10 countries with the most talented developers. <br><br>  China and Russia dominate far from all spheres.  For example, SQL and Shell tasks are best solved by developers from Denmark and the Czech Republic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb0/8c2/fdf/eb08c2fdfafc6723fd988b8c0d11c2c4.png"><br><br>  Programmers in some countries are involved in solving problems in certain subjects more often than others.  In the case of China, this is due to the fact that the universities and colleges in this country have a slightly fewer available disciplines than in a number of other countries.  Therefore, students do not have such a large selection.  Plus, in the same China, many start programming in high school, not to mention high school students.  The table below shows the countries whose programmers are involved in solving problems of a number of disciplines more often than others.  At the same time, in the next, third column, countries are shown whose programmers rarely try to solve the tasks of the specified range of disciplines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de9/c1c/b26/de9c1cb26bcead3cb718a457394258a3.png"><br><br>  As you can see, users from China more often than others try to solve math problems.  Most likely, due to this, China and won first place in mathematics. <br><br>  Another interesting point is the distribution of the popularity of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãamong developers from different countries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30a/36f/4ab/30a36f4abb894e2a034d5e3f55dd9050.png"><br><br>  According to HackerRank, Java tasks are the most popular among users of this platform (from different countries).  The exceptions are programmers from Malaysia and Pakistan, who prefer C ++. <br><br>  More often than others, users from Switzerland successfully solve their problems.  When a user surrenders without solving a problem, he gets 0 points.  The percentage of such developers is maximum in countries such as Pakistan, Malaysia and Nigeria.  And minimal in Switzerland, Hungary and Poland. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/050/0b5/334/0500b53342e5796297638122b950ad32.png"><br><br>  Representatives of HackerRank believe that if the Programming Olympiad were held now, the Chinese team would receive gold, the Russians would become second, winning silver, and the Poles third, receiving bronze.  But India and the United States will have to work hard to enter at least the top 25 Olympic teams. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372633/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372633/</a></p>
