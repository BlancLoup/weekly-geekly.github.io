The latest <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/03/19/754128-rossiyane-telefonu">statistics of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications</a> shows that voice traffic in the networks of Russian cellular operators is not decreasing, but even growing a little. <br><br><ul><li>  Voice traffic in 2016: 452.8 billion minutes </li><li>  Voice traffic in 2017: 455.8 billion minutes </li></ul><br>  As we see, last year Russians spent 1% more time on voice conversations in cellular networks than in 2016.  On average, 3159 minutes per person, that is, 8 minutes and 54 seconds per day. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/97d/c94/05b/97dc9405b7d4b31e77bb3d7e9cba1cba.png" align="left">  As can be seen in the diagram from the Vedomosti newspaper, voice traffic in the cellular network is gradually increasing, but this growth is mainly due to fixed communications (wired phones). <br><br>  Voice traffic is still not reduced due to the popularity of Internet instant messengers and mobile Internet traffic, although the growth is phenomenal.  Over the year, the volume of Internet traffic from mobile devices grew by almost 87% to 6.5 petabytes.

      The relative growth numbers of mobile Internet traffic seem large, but in absolute terms they do not look so impressive.  6.5 petabytes to all of Russia is an average of 45 megabytes per person per year, that is, 123 kilobytes per day. <br><br>  Thus, the average Russian speaks on a mobile phone for 9 minutes daily and generates a transfer of 123 kilobytes of information. <br><br>  It can be assumed that mobile traffic will grow at the same rapid pace in the coming years, but voice traffic is near its maximum level.  Further growth is unlikely, but the fall is quite possible. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the Big Three operators do not disclose MoU statistics, that is, the number of voice minutes spent by the subscriber.  But from the Veon report, it follows that the MoU of its ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù - ‚ÄúVimpelCom‚Äù in the 4th quarter of 2017 decreased compared to the 4th quarter of 2016 by 3.6% and amounted to 323 minutes.  Representatives of the company commented on these statistics and said that the decline in voice traffic is ‚Äúinsignificant‚Äù, but the consumption of voice traffic is ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù.  The network has grown subscribers speaking more than 300 minutes per month. <br><br>  Russia, Ukraine and Belarus are among the world leaders in low-cost mobile communications.  In these countries, one of the lowest tariffs in the world for voice communications and Internet traffic, therefore, their habits, convenience and accessibility of services, and not cost, affect the behavior of subscribers in the first place.  In fact, people talk on the phone as much as they want without restricting themselves because of tariffs.  The same generally applies to mobile data. <br><br>  Previously, mobile operators looked with fear at the messengers who threatened to take away their voice traffic and turn the operators into "stupid" providers who simply give the band.  But practice shows that voice calls via instant messengers have not yet become a general trend.  According to the EY survey, in February 2018, only 8% of Russians used messengers more often for calls than dial-up connections, which involved dialing a number.  The messengers are not yet used so often that normal voice traffic drops noticeably because of them, analysts say.  Most Russians simply do not use instant messengers.  Moreover, <b>about 40% of Russians still do not use smartphones</b> , and mobile Internet coverage is not ideal even in large cities. <br><br>  Nevertheless, operators see a tendency to increase the consumption of mobile traffic - and try to develop more attractive rates for those users who find mobile Internet as important or more important than voice communication and SMS.  For example, VimpelCom is preparing to issue tariffs, where you can exchange the voice minutes and SMS included in the tariff plan for gigabytes of mobile Internet.  For example, in Moscow, 300 SMS change to 1 gigabyte of traffic. <br><br>  Not only VimpelCom, but Megafon also captures a slight decline in revenue from voice services.  Revenue is gradually decreasing, but for operators it is not very critical, because they compensate for lost revenues by making profits in other areas, including data transfer. <br><br>  Analysts believe that in modern conditions more and more subscribers are connected to package tariffs, and voice communication is already perceived simply as an additional option in the package of services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371357/</a></p>
