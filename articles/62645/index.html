  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Law on the activity of payment terminals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From January 1, 2010, the Law ‚ÄúOn the activity of receiving payments from individuals carried out by payment agents‚Äù will come into force.  Many articles have already been written on this topic, in particular, the most recent in the previous issue of Money magazine (June 15). <br><br>  Prior to the adoption of the law, the business of instant payment systems existed in a legal vacuum.  Now it is governed by its own legal norms, the scheme has become transparent, the rights of all are protected.  This means that now you can pay in this way absolutely for everything.  For example, pay state fees and fines, including traffic police.  True, to agree with each department, you need to spend a lot of time and effort, but now it has become possible. <br><br>  One of the important innovations of the law is that each terminal must be equipped with cash registers.  This is very useful for users: as soon as you receive a check on depositing money in the terminal, your payment obligations are considered fulfilled regardless of whether the amount reached the final recipient. <br>  The article discusses what to do if the check has not been issued and the money has been deposited.  But terminals with the right software do not allow making a payment if the cash register tape has run out. <br>  In 8 cases out of 10, the payment is ‚Äúlost‚Äù due to the fact that the user himself made a mistake when dialing the number, and then also confirmed the correctness. <br>  If you pay via QIWI Personal Area, this problem is solved simply: if such a number does not exist, the money will simply return to the account.  If the number exists, in any case, you will have to go to the office of the operator to whom the payment was sent.

      Another issue is that upgrading the terminal equipment may entail an increase in commission.  Will this happen, when and to what extent is still unknown.  Now when paying through QIWI LC, no commission is charged at all, but not the fact that the situation will remain the same. <br><br>  The adoption of a new law was actively hampered by banks.  The Association of Russian Banks wrote complaints to the President.  Even at one time there were rumors that the terminals would be closed altogether. <br>  NAUET predicts that by the end of the year the turnover of money passing through the payment terminals will be 700 billion rubles (22 billion dollars).  The volume is already rather big, and every year it grows by tens of percent - there is something to worry about.  Kesh always, and especially now, banks are absolutely necessary.  In addition, the terminals are like a bone in the throat - in order to compete with them, banks need to think about improving their services, user-friendliness.  That is, spend additional funds. <br><br>  This year, in particular in connection with the adoption of the law, experts expect an increase in the size of the average check in the payment terminals.  The credibility of this means of payment will increase, and people will be more willing to pay for various services.  The QIWI Personal Cabinet service also contributes to convenience and reliability, in which you can trace the path of each ruble from the terminal to the final recipient. <br><br>  Will the law increase your confidence in terminals? <br><br>  What is the maximum amount of payment you made? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62645/</a></p>
