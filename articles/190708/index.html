The solution includes NetApp <abbr title="Fabric attached storage">FAS</abbr> <abbr title="Storage System">storage</abbr> , Cisco <abbr title="Unified Computing System">UCS</abbr> Server, Cisco <abbr title="Unified Computing System">UCS</abbr> Fabric Interconnect, Cisco Nexus 5548UP Converged Switch and VMWare hypervisor (and later Hyper-V).  The solution has become quite popular due to the current trends of the ‚Äúprivate cloud‚Äù, consolidation and virtualization of IT systems in general. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4a/48c/94c/e4a48c94c18c80638463ec4f40930eba.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Despite global popularity, the FlexPod is still a rather rare solution within the framework of the <abbr title="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">USSR</abbr> .  Perhaps this is due to the relatively considerable threshold of ‚Äúentry‚Äù, which not every enterprise is ready to ‚Äúbudget‚Äù in order to increase IT efficiency in the future, can be confused by the outwardly similar proposal from competitors, with 2100+ implementations in the world.

      In the recent past, to meet the needs of medium and small organizations, within the framework of the ‚ÄúDatacenter-In-A-Box‚Äù concept, Cisco and NetApp published a ‚Äúcompact‚Äù <abbr title="Small and Medium-sized Businesses">SMB</abbr> variant of the FlexPod architecture - ExpressPod, which was then renamed FlexPod Express.  The complex almost instantly established itself as a profitable, reliable and easily scalable platform for the effective solution of server resource consolidation tasks. <br><br>  What is the beauty of the ‚Äúset-up‚Äù in comparison with other offers of the market? <br>  First, the solution is designed and tested jointly by Cisco and NetApp.  As a result - balanced components and the absence of "bottlenecks".  Moreover, companies that have implemented FlexpPod Express can expect easy low-cost scaling while maintaining unity in terms of managing the system and performing day-to-day backup, archiving, etc. <br>  Secondly, FlexPod Express, like the FlexPod ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù, is supported jointly by Cisco, NetApp and VMWare.  This refers to that when addressing any support of any of the ‚Äúindustry giants‚Äù listed above, the user will receive a full and comprehensive consultation on his decision, even if it was Cisco, and difficulties arose with NetApp or VMWare. <br>  Further, more :) FlexPod Express (aka ExpressPod) is delivered by us to the end customer in the form of a preconfigured solution, ready to deploy business applications in a fully configured, fault-tolerant virtualized environment.  When ordering, it is sufficient to specify the preferred hypervisor (vSphere or Hyper-V).  This allows, at least 2-3 weeks to reduce the time required to run targeted business applications and get a fully predictable result, the quality of which gives the tooth not only the integrator company, but also reputable manufacturers in the world market. <br>  The ideology of a single system management is also preserved - it means ex-Cloupia, which is now called Cisco <abbr title="Unified Computing System">UCS</abbr> Manager.  This is what allows ExpressPod to aesthetically integrate into the family of validated FlexPod architectures. <br><br>  What hides under the common marketing name "FlexPod Express"?  Like any other platform for building a ‚Äúprivate cloud‚Äù, FlexPod Express can be logically divided into: <br>  <b>Computational part</b> <br>  Rack-Mount is introduced by Cisco <abbr title="Unified Computing System">UCS</abbr> -2/4 Cisco <abbr title="Unified Computing System">UCS</abbr> C220 M3 servers.  In each of the servers, there are 2 powerful 8-core Intel E5-2650 processors, 64GB RAM +, an <abbr title="Internet Small Computer System Interface">iSCSI-</abbr> specific network card (with hardware <abbr title="TCP Offload Engine">TOE</abbr> , which, in essence, ‚Äúdeploys‚Äù the IP packet with the <abbr title="Small Computer System Interface">SCSI</abbr> team, issues the <abbr title="Operating system">OS</abbr> ready for receiving <abbr title="Small Computer System Interface">SCSI</abbr> command, which can significantly reduce the load on the processors and response time). <br>  <b>Network part</b> <br>  In ExpressPod, this is 2 Cisco Nexus 3048, functioning as a single failover switch that allows you to aggregate ports into physically separate <abbr title="Virtual port channel">hardware</abbr> into one <abbr title="Virtual port channel">vPC</abbr> Trunk.  Even since Nexus was originally designed specifically for servicing network storage, Latency packet switching within the system will be guaranteed less than 1ms (in fact, about 1 microsecond), which allows you to fully take advantage of vSphere functionality such as Fault Tolerance. <br>  <b>Data storage</b> <br>  For ExpressPod, this is NetApp <abbr title="Fabric attached storage">FAS</abbr> 2220/2240.  Here, the user immediately gets bundled with a smart, fault-tolerant data storage for the hypervisor, and the possibilities of organizing <abbr title="Common Internet File System">CIFS</abbr> ( <abbr title="Server message block">SMB</abbr> ) / <abbr title="Network file system">NFS</abbr> user data storage and of course all the advantages of NetApp ‚Äî deduplication, thin-provisioning, instant clones that do not take up space, etc. <br><br>  The basic configuration ExpressPod offers 2 options - Small and Medium.  They differ in the number of servers (2 or 4) and the NetApp <abbr title="Fabric attached storage">FAS</abbr> <abbr title="Storage System">storage</abbr> model (2220 or 2240).  In both configurations, Gigabit Ethernet is used as the data transmission medium, and more specifically, 4 * GbE trunks combined with <abbr title="Link Aggregation Control Protocol">LACP</abbr> + <abbr title="Virtual port channel">vPC</abbr> .  In principle, this channel width will be sufficient for most even the most demanding users, but if necessary, 10GbE ports can be used at any time ‚Äî all you need is to purchase Twinax-type 10GbE cables or SFP + modules and LC-LC optical patches + corresponding <abbr title="Peripheral Component Interconnect Express">PCI-e</abbr> cards for servers / <abbr title="Storage System">storage</abbr> . <br>  In general, the ExpressPod configuration is very balanced and easily scalable.  If necessary, add.  space or performance of the disk subsystem will be enough to connect to the <abbr title="Storage System">storage</abbr> additional disk shelf.  Add.  Computing resources can be easily obtained by adding <abbr title="Unified Computing System">UCS</abbr> C-Series servers, connecting them to free ports on Nexus (only 2x 3048 - 96 GbE ports and 8 - 10GbE). <br><br>  All this allows us to provide the customer with a complete integrated solution for consolidation / centralized infrastructure management and, as a result, a significant reduction in operating costs within a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù enterprise (up to 500 users). <br><br>  If you are interested in the solution, it‚Äôs enough to call or contact by e-mail - the certified specialists of Inforada are always ready to help conduct pre-qualification of the offers available on the market and help, later, qualitatively implement the implementation to achieve maximum efficiency when using modern IT technologies in the business. <br><br>  Published according to the materials of <a href="http://inforada.com.ua/site/index.php/products-inforada/flexpod-express-or-expresspod">Inforada</a> . <br>  <b>Comments on errors in the text and suggestions please send to the <abbr title="Private message">LAN</abbr> .</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190708/</a></p>
