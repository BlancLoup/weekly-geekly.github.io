For the last 150 rubles with a friend, we bought a telephone jack for the Internet, a plug and products for the week.  Then we lived in Butovo, on the m. ‚ÄúBuninskaya alley‚Äù, behind the house, the apartment in which we rented, there was only a forest and a highway. <br>  Every time, passing over the Butovo voids on the air metro from some customer, I looked and thought: ‚ÄúIt would be nice here to build a large office for web developers of all stripes.  So that people from all over the country could come here they would have small rooms for sleeping and solitude + office places for work ... They would look for a job for themselves, or take it from the general office exchange, or make their own projects.  Centralized nutrition, normalized mode, communication with their own kind, and most importantly - do not try to survive and prove to each customer that he really needs you ... ".  We lived in the area about six months, until the money ran out and we did not stop paying for an apartment.  And every time I traveled by air, I always thought about such an office.  At some point in time, looking out the window, I began to draw it myself ... <br>  2-3 months ago in Habr√©, I read about a new way of working with freelancers ‚Äî co-working, my heart beat‚Ä¶ <a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/10e/d9d/bf2/10ed9dbf2052d640e89e5058b4ea9070.jpg" width="450" height="271" alt="munga.ru" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  I opened Zend and did not go to work the next day.  I wanted to do something useful for coworking, damn it, I want to promote it to the masses.  I want to launch an advertising campaign in the metro ala ‚ÄúTired of working in an office?  Come and try to work for yourself! ".  But for now all my actions are limited to creating a project for coworkers - <a href="http://www.munga.ru/">munga.ru</a> .  In fact, this is just a catalog of offices with advanced features for description, uploading photos, a blog and so on.  But thanks to the fact that I always reinvent the wheel, it turned out quite interesting and new. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/1d4/0c7/e3a/1d40c7e3a2273c5f5f7da3a5303c7a2a.jpg" width="450" height="272" alt="munga.ru" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Each office is painted point by point, office locations are painted and how much they cost, what is included in them.  In general, if the owner of the office is not lazy, any user will not only be able to find out about the office, he will be able to find out EVERYTHING about the office, its residents, what they do, read the office blog, see photos and so on.  So to say, a little such a community. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c61/16d/1ad/c6116d1adf8e290cb64315ac5d0d6a1f.jpg" width="305" height="184" alt="munga.ru" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">  But best of all, anyone can add an office.  Offices pass only post-moderation, no one limits you in anything. <br>  Are you just planning an office?  Choose a place?  I made it possible to add the so-called "pseudo-office", the main differences: <br><br>  1) There is no office blog, there is a board where everyone can write their opinions, wishes and preferences. <br>  2) Everywhere there is a voting block consisting of points of estimated places (which the author added), so the author of realtime can track the opinion of those interested. <br>  3) Instead of jobs that need to be described, the author describes the proposed locations for the office, describes the conditions and so forth. <br>  4) Pseudo offices have the ‚ÄúWIZARD‚Äù button in the admin panel, which will help the author quickly and easily turn the pseudo-office into a full-featured office project as soon as he has decided on a place. <br><br>  Thus, I would like to present a general picture about coworking to interested people and, accordingly, give the opportunity to the first promotion for office owners.  Of course, at this point in time, hardly any office needs promotion, but there are offices that are not represented anywhere else.  For example, the same " <a href="http://office.munga.ru/lifecrealab/info">Life Creativity Lab</a> ", which for some reason no one writes.  But in fact, it is a good alternative to Moscovorking.  At least this office and with a shower (preved bicykostegi!) And other nishtyak.  Unfair =)

    <h2>  Where to begin? </h2><br>  From the head.  Try to understand what is coworking for you?  Is it right for you?  If you even thought about it for a second, then you should at least try.  For this: <br>  <a href="http://www.munga.ru/">Go to munga.ru</a> ‚Üí to the <a href="http://office.munga.ru/catalog">section offices / catalog</a> ‚Üí Filter your region <br>  Browse found offices, read about them and be sure to call the owner, the phones are most often presented either in the office description or in the owner's profile.  And better - just come look at the office, in 99% of cases you will be welcomed with warm embraces.  Just look at how everything happens and imagine how you would personally fit into such offices. <br>  And if there are no or not enough offices in your region, create your own;) <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/fotonstep/" class="user_link">fotonstep</a> (Alexey Glazkov, the founder of the <a href="http://office.munga.ru/hakuna_matata">Tower</a> office) has written more than once about how to make your office and what it means and that the office pays off in during half a year. <br><br>  In general, I will be glad to see everyone in the coworking party on my project, or on the attendant =) <br>  Many thanks to <a href="http://users.munga.ru/fotonstep">Alexey Glazkov</a> and his <a href="http://office.munga.ru/hakuna_matata/user">gang</a> , <a href="http://users.munga.ru/kiranoff">kiranoff</a> , <a href="http://users.munga.ru/dady">DadyUA</a> , <a href="http://users.munga.ru/indigo">indigo</a> and <a href="http://users.munga.ru/tenzor7">tenzor7</a> for actively promoting the topic to the masses. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27614/</a></p>
