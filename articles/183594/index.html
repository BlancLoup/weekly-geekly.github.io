      Probably, this post was supposed to be the first among the descriptions of photo devices intended for shooting Mars.  But it so happened that I wanted to write about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182584/">HiRISE</a> immediately after the success of the project among the Russian-speaking audience.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtelling about the unique <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/183294/">HRSC stereo camera</a> came from the widely known in narrow circles, habrauser-marsoved <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/zelenyikot/" class="user_link">Zelenyikot</a> .  But the idea to make a comparison of all the cameras that have ever shot Mars, came already in the process.  And, probably, it was not by chance that this coincided with the 50th anniversary of the passage (albeit uncontrollable) of the Soviet apparatus. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here is the entire technical part of the article in two tables.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><table><tbody><tr><th colspan="4"><h4>  The main parameters of the shooting apparatus </h4></th></tr><tr><td>  Tool </td><td>  Focal length </td><td>  Spectral range </td><td>  The number of transmitted images,% of the surface of Mars </td></tr><tr><th colspan="4">  Mariner 4 (United States, 1965) </th></tr><tr><td>  Vidicon </td><td>  305 mm </td><td>  Red Green </td><td>  22 (1%) </td></tr><tr><th colspan="4">  Mariner 6, 7 (United States, 1969) </th></tr><tr><td>  Vidicon (Camera A) </td><td>  52 mm </td><td rowspan="2">  Red, green, blue, yellow </td><td rowspan="2">  Mariner 6 - 75 <br>  Mariner 7 - 126 <br>  Only about 20% </td></tr><tr><td>  Vidicon (Camera B) </td><td>  508 mm </td>

W, 255 ¬∞ c.  d. (which in general is about 1% of the entire surface of the planet).  The pictures were taken through red or green filters, and their pairs overlapped to get more information about the color of the surface.  Image resolution was 200 lines of 200 pixels, 6 bits per pixel.  A total of 21 full shots and partially 22 shots (21 lines) were received.  The pictures were taken at different distances, with a minimum of 11.8 thousand km.  The transfer of images was carried out at a speed of 8.33 bps (one frame took more than 8.5 hours) from a distance of more than 216 million km. <br><br>  First frame: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/058/cc7/fcd/058cc7fcd98bd166fa43bb5d71ee82ca.gif"><br><br>  The second frame: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50f/2c0/df4/50f2c0df4c36200001a701a2cd82c648.gif"><br><br>  Mosaic from the first and second frames: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e3/ee3/b98/2e3ee3b98e82cacd91cf092a0ae27789.gif"><br><br>  <i><a href="http://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/miscellaneous/planetary/mariner_4/">Catalog of all images of Mars from ‚ÄúMariner-4‚Äù</a></i> <hr>  Despite the fact that "Mars-1" could not become the first "photographer" of Mars, he had a much more powerful television equipment than the "Mariner-4".  On board was a 32-kilogram photo-television camera, which could shoot with a resolution of up to 1,440 lines (720 lines in alternative mode or 68 lines in preview mode): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/62b/1e7/a97/62b1e7a97a3cb87637c9f66bac43d10e.jpg"><br><br>  The camera contained both 35 mm and 750 mm optics; it used 70 mm film, which should have been enough for 112 frames.  The shooting mode involved either square images or rectangular 3: 1.  The captured and developed images were then to be scanned and transmitted to Earth.  The camera also had an ultraviolet spectrograph: the UV spectrum was recorded immediately behind the captured image.  In addition, the camera had a 3-4 micron infrared diffraction spectrometer located parallel to its optical axis.  Given the secrecy of the Soviet space exploration projects, we can only assume that the constructor of this camera was P.F.  Bratslavets (his "Yenisei" first removed the reverse side of the moon in 1959). <br><br>  The Mars-1 camera was equipped with its own 6 GHz transmitter, which, consuming 50 W, produced short pulses of 25 kW each.  At that time, redundant systems had not yet been applied, and high-power pulsed transmission was a truly ingenious invention for increasing capacity at a distance of 300 million kilometers.  Images should be transmitted pixel-by-pixel at a speed of approximately 90 pixels per second, which would require more than 6 hours to transfer a single image with a resolution of 1440x1440. <hr><br><h5>  "Mariner-6" and "Mariner-7" (USA, 1969), study from the flight path </h5><br>  Two identical NASA spacecraft Mariner-6 and Mariner-7 were launched on February 24 and March 27, 1969, respectively, and passed around Mars at a distance of 3.4 thousand km on July 31 and August 5.  On each unit, two television cameras (Vidicon) were installed: wide-angle (f = 52 mm) for shooting a full disc of Mars from long distances and a long-focus (f = 508 mm) for shooting while approaching the planet.  At the closest approach, the image of the long-focus camera covered the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe planet‚Äôs surface approximately 72x84 km and made it possible to distinguish craters up to 300 m in size. The wide-angle camera produced an image 100 times larger than the long-focus one. <br><br>  When shooting at close range, the cameras worked alternately at intervals of 42 s between exposures.  The wide-angle camera was equipped with red, green and blue filters, mounted in the holes of the rotating flap.  The long-focus camera had only a yellow filter to eliminate the ‚Äúblue haze‚Äù that could be present in the atmosphere of Mars. <br><br>  The optical system of each camera created a television image consisting of 704 lines of 935 pixels each.  Each pixel has 8-bit encoding.  Of course, the technical capabilities of that period did not allow to transfer the image in real time and were recorded on a magnetic tape, and two recording systems were used: digital (in binary format with a capacity of 13 Mbps) and analog with an effective capacity of 120 Mbps.  In total, Mariner-6 transmitted 75 images (including 26 from a long-focus camera), Mariner-7 - 126 images (including 33 from a long-focus camera).  The total surface area, which is represented in the pictures from a short distance, was about 20%. <br><br>  Examples of images from "Mariner 6" and "Mariner 7": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/38c/3fd/c7e/38c3fdc7e3ab00a1a6e9138aa37eb670.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b3/fd2/2a2/3b3fd22a2019c56461ce8ab18cb29b5b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/484/e9c/483/484e9c483e14f39bfc3b63c4a711cd93.jpg"><br><br>  More photos can be viewed <a href="http://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/miscellaneous/planetary/mariner_6_7/">here</a> and <a href="http://petermasek.tripod.com/mariner67.html">here</a> . <br><br><hr>  In the same year of 1969, with a difference of a week, the USSR launched spacecraft of the M-69 series: ‚ÄúMars-1969A‚Äù and ‚ÄúMars-1969B‚Äù, which included 3 television cameras (35, 50 and 250 mm) that could color TV shows, as well as take pictures of 1024x1024 pixels and a maximum spatial resolution of up to 200 meters.  The number of images stored on one camera could be 160. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8ad/4d7/8d6/8ad4d78d658ba2d73e6fb72fcde1078b.jpg"><br><br>  However, both ships as a result of missile launch accidents failed to go beyond the Earth: Mars 1969A exploded and fell in the Altai Mountains as a result of the main engine failure at 439 seconds, Mars 1969B as a result of failure first, and then 5 remaining boosters, exploded already at 41 seconds after launch, reaching a height of 3 kilometers. <hr><br><h5>  Mariner-9 (USA, 1971-1972) </h5><br>  Mariner-9, as well as most of the devices of its time, was equipped with two cameras: wide-angle and long-focus (f = 500 mm).  Cameras had approximately the same characteristics as in ‚ÄúMariners-6, 7‚Äù: 700 lines with 832 pixels each.  The image was recorded on film in the form of a rectangle with a physical size of 9.6 x 12.5 mm.  The field of view angles for the long-focus camera were 1.1x1.4 ". Mariner-9 was originally planned to be taken on the surface of Mars immediately after it entered the planet‚Äôs orbit, but due to a dust storm that began on September 22, 1971, the entire scientific program was in doubt (it was impossible to predict when the atmosphere would calm down and the details of the surface would be available for observation). <br><br>  For 349 days of work on the near-Martian orbit, the spacecraft transmitted a total of 7329 images, covering about 85% of the planet‚Äôs surface with a resolution of 1 to 2 km (2% of the surface were photographed with a resolution of 100 to 300 meters).  The pictures show dried river beds, craters, huge volcanic formations (such as Olympus Volcano - the largest volcano found in the Solar System), canyons (including the Mariner valleys - a giant system of canyons over 4000 kilometers long), signs of wind and water erosion and displacement layers, weather fronts, fog and many more interesting details.  Also, the satellites of Mars, Phobos and Deimos were photographed (at the end of 1971 about 40 images were taken, then about 70 more).  Mariner-9 will remain in Mars orbit for about 50 years, after which it will enter its atmosphere. <br><br>  Sample images: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb9/6be/5c1/eb96be5c1c53b64d3626430964ec7e94.jpg"><br>  <i>Labyrinths in the western part of the Mariner Valleys</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8d9/cfa/94a/8d9cfa94a9b8b0518eb12bb2d6bf6c06.jpg"><br>  <i>Central Caldera of Mount Olympus</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/64c/bdb/2ae/64cbdb2aebdebc90175df6b2fca96d9e.jpg"><br>  <i>Cap on the North Pole</i> <br><br>  More photos from Mariner 9 can be viewed <a href="http://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/miscellaneous/planetary/mariner_9/">here</a> and <a href="http://petermasek.tripod.com/mariner9.html">here</a> . <br><br><h5>  "Mars-2" and "Mars-3" (USSR, 1972) </h5><br>  These spacecraft were created in the USSR as part of the M-71 project, which provided for the launch of three spacecraft in 1971.  As in the case of Mariners-6, 7, constructively Mars-2 and Mars-3 were similar and duplicated each other in case of a possible failure.  The devices were equipped with photo and television installations with f = 52 mm and f = 350 mm.  Because of the problems with telemetry at Mars-2, only a few images of the planet were obtained from this device, which, moreover, almost all the relief was hidden by a sandstorm raging at that moment: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/41a/5b7/d2d/41a5b7d2d330ebba20db1532eaf23406.jpg"><br><br>  Mars-3 continued to shoot, but due to the failure of one of the transmitters, the images were transmitted only in low quality (250 lines), although the equipment maintained a resolution of up to 1000 lines of 1000 px.  As it turned out, in addition to the sandstorm and problems with the transmitter, the developers of television installations used the wrong model of Mars, so the wrong shutter speeds were chosen.  The pictures were obtained by lightened, almost completely unsuitable (in the pictures: the boundary of the atmosphere of Mars and the mountains near the equator): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49a/f9c/e51/49af9ce518f0646d980917b525f7b61d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ef/898/5a0/9ef8985a0b0ffe8bc1d9a3c1e1db6b17.jpg"><br><br>  The history of the Mars-3 descent module <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175827/">has already been highlighted</a> in Habr√©.  Therefore, for completeness, I will only leave the most unreadable image of 79 lines that the module managed to transmit to Earth: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/018/4a0/036/0184a0036edf65b461ea57a695ec0deb.jpg"><br><br><h5>  "Mars-4" and "Mars-5" (USSR, 1973) </h5><br>  "Mars-4" and "Mars-5" used several advanced photo and television installations from "Mars-3" (improved optics, new photomultiplier tube FEU-103): <br><br>  Zufar-2SA long-focus camera (f = 350 and viewing angle of 5.67 ¬∞): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/528/419/7ab/5284197ab76f55e465c3f3af7fcd2650.jpg"><br><br>  Wide-angle camera "Vega-3MSA" (f = 52 and viewing angle of 35.7 ¬∞): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c25/953/059/c2595305950566feca20f92d5fc8b547.jpg"><br><br>  Each camera had 20 meters of 25.4 mm film, which should have been enough for 480 frames.  The exposure time ranged from 1/50 to 1/150 s, after which the film appeared and was scanned.  There were 10 different scanning modes, but in practice 3 main ones were used: all images in previews are 235x220 in size, some in the normal resolution of 940x880, and particularly interesting details - with a maximum resolution of 1880x1760 pixels.  The pulse transmitter could operate in modes from 512 to 1024 pixels per second. <br><br>  "Mars-4" in accordance with the scientific program was to go into orbit around the planet and provide communication with the automatic Martian stations intended for work on the surface.  Two minutes before the pericenter of the approaching hyperbola, the wide-angle ‚ÄúVega‚Äù was turned on (due to a malfunction of the long-focus camera detected 5 days before approaching, this photo-television device did not turn on).  A 12-frame cycle of the survey of Mars from a flying trajectory at a distance of 1900/2100 km on a scale of 1: 5000000 was carried out  The pictures were of good quality: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f5f/2a2/76a/f5f2a276aa74c52173e904f4e8c0116d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e0/ee3/2e8/4e0ee32e8827754831779f012b3ec004.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, using photophotometers, we surveyed panoramas of two regions of the surface of Mars (in the orange and red-infrared ranges): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f70/d97/191/f70d97191d65bb92e5fca9b380a2bf1f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3a7/53c/e89/3a753ce8955d0d307ef1b2b3003028a2.jpg"><br><br>  Due to a malfunction in the operation of one of the onboard systems, the Mars-4 brake propulsion system did not turn on and the AMC passed near the planet along a flight path, approaching a minimum distance of 1,844 km, continuing flight in a heliocentric orbit. <br><br>  Mars-5, unlike its predecessor, successfully entered the orbit of the Red Planet and transmitted 60 images taken through blue, red, green, and additional special orange light filters with surface resolutions from 100 m to 1 km. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/188/24d/b69/18824db6960547bb7dd7741e152db209.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e27/16a/0f2/e2716a0f28e7afc82ee4a5a73323f8df.jpg"><br><br>  Composite images (RGB): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ba/8f7/942/5ba8f79426aa885d9f8b60c78835ce50.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87d/c5e/32e/87dc5e32e451e8d5e69ee92725650fe7.jpg"><br><br>  More photos of Mars from the Soviet missions <a href="http://mentallandscape.com/C_CatalogMars.htm">here</a> . <br><br><h5>  Viking-1 and Viking-2 (United States, 1976-1980) </h5><br>  Successes "Vikings", as a rule, are described by the first successful experience of the descent vehicle.  However, each orbital station possessed two television cameras (f = 475), which in 5 years of the mission took more than 52 thousand images.  The optical system of the apparatus was a Schmidt-Cassegrain system with MTF = 0.7 at a Nyquist of 42 lp / mm: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/966/d6a/a1f/966d6aa1f21585d4b9e8c6c62bcc3dc7.jpg"><br><br>  The resolution of the cameras was 1056 lines of 1182 pixels.  Between the lenses and the mechanical shutter there was a wheel with six color filters: blue (0.35 - 0.53 Œºm), negative blue (0.48 - 0.70), purple (0.35 - 0.47), green ( 0.50 - 0.60), red (0.55 - 0.70) and clear.  The viewing angles of the cameras were 1.54 ¬∞ x 1.69 ¬∞, which was about 40x44 km on the surface at an altitude of 1500 km.  When shooting, the overlay mode was provided, which allowed later to combine images into large-scale mosaics with almost no loss of quality: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/071/374/c1a/071374c1a43867601447a0a0dcab01ba.jpg"><br><br>  The exposure time of each image ranged from 0.003 to 2.66 seconds.  Cameras could shoot one image at 8.96 s, with the interleaving of cameras, the orbiter could receive an image every 4.48 s.  Images were digitized with 7 bits and recorded on a magnetic tape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/321/cb5/446/321cb544661277ce736c847695e91d08.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/649/8ee/b18/6498eeb1866cdfa4394948499ee73a53.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f8/9eb/8d0/5f89eb8d0c9bba57352819fea0db70f7.jpg"><br><br>  Catalog of images from the "Vikings" <a href="http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/viking/vo1_vo2-m-vis-2-edr-v2/">here</a> and <a href="http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/volumes/viking.html">here</a> . <br><br><h5>  Mars Global Surveyor (USA, 1997-2006) </h5><br>  This orbital device for the first time had on its board a camera based on a CCD - Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c9/11d/3d0/9c911d3d06f00a10e58f598d276af9d4.jpg"><br><br>  The scanning camera had both wide-angle (140 ¬∞) and narrow-angle (0.4 ¬∞) optics, which ensured both global surface shooting (7.5 km per pixel) and high resolution for certain areas (up to 1.4 meters at pixel). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e61/55d/c0a/e6155dc0acdc50545b2308b1a6e84dd4.jpg"><br><br>  The optical system of the narrow-angle camera was represented by a Richie-Chretien telescope with a focal length of 3.5 m and a set of filters for operation in the range of 500‚Äì900 nm.
