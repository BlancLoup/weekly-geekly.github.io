First became one of the most popular manufacturers of compact cassette players (the legendary Walkman), then - CD players ... and now - a player designed for sports.  Moreover, ‚Äúsport‚Äù means not only some kind of light jogging on a cloudy morning or waving dumbbells in a fitness center.  Sony took and released a player that will allow you to listen to Santa Lucy even in the pool. <br><br>  <i>Note: At this moment, cupids with copper pipes should come down from heaven, rays of divine light should be shed, and then white winged angels should come for the developers, as they embody the pleas of millions of swimmers.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb5/207/865/bb5207865333455cbc0896365dbc30e0.jpg">

      Today we have on the test - <b>SONY NWZ-WS615</b> is not the first waterproof player of the company, but personally I am familiar with the last line only from reviews of friends and records on the Internet, so do not expect a direct comparison. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Funny thing: when Sony undertakes to develop the product - it turns out to be either a masterpiece or a nightmare;  intermediate results are practically not found.  Moreover, even the ‚Äúnightmarish‚Äù from the point of view of the mass consumer products find their fans, who then beg the Japanese to make the second version of the most terrible% devicename% in the world, because without it, their life is no longer pretty, and all the samples five years old have already bought by 2-3 copies, in case the existing one breaks.  I wonder how it will be with the new product? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Opportunities</font> </h2><br>  First, let's talk about the capabilities of this device.  Although the device has 16GB of memory, it is still not just a player.  Headphones have a built-in Bluetooth A2DP-module that allows them to be used as a wireless stereo gadget.  That is, they can be connected to a smartphone and used to listen to music, watch videos or talk.  In addition, SONY would not be SONY, if it had not stuck something of its own into the device, with a typically Japanese love of multi-functionality in electronics.  So this time, the headset and player can work in a hybrid mode: the music will play independently, on the ‚Äúheadphone‚Äù side, and in the case of a call, it will pause, and the smartphone will take over control.  Theoretically, it is very convenient. <br><br>  Here is what the manufacturer claims as product features: <br><blockquote>  <b>Size and weight:</b> <br>  Weight - 37 g; <br><br>  <b>Nutrition:</b> <br>  Continuous music playback - 7 hours; <br>  Charging time (full charge) - 1.5 hours; <br>  Charging time (fast charging) - 3 minutes (60 minutes of use); <br><br>  <b>Storage device:</b> <br>  Memory capacity - 16 GB; <br>  Expansion memory - absent; <br><br>  <b>Interfaces:</b> <br>  Wired connection - USB, through the docking station; <br>  Wireless connection - Bluetooth¬Æ, NFC; <br><br>  <b>Sound effects:</b> <br>  Equalizer (5 bands); <br>  Clear Bass; <br>  Dynamic normalizer; <br>  Clear phase; <br><br>  <b>Supported formats:</b> <br>  mp3, WMA (without DRM), AAC (without DRM), Linear PCM; <br><br>  <b>Water Resistant:</b> <br>  Immersion depth - up to 2 meters; <br>  Operating time at the maximum depth - up to 30 minutes. <br></blockquote><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Design</font> </h2><br>  Appearance, packaging and packaging - typical of the products of the Japanese giant.  The box is white and transparent plastic, just like a SmartWatch, about which we wrote not so long ago. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/209/48e/c98/20948ec9897e44abac5ad287a472797f.jpg"><br><br>  Inside - the player itself, a docking station and a plastic "carrying". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07a/417/6c7/07a4176c735f4ea294c83bee30c6983f"><br><br>  In addition, the set includes a generous set of interchangeable ‚Äúplugs‚Äù (some of them are for ‚Äúpedestrian‚Äù use, and some - for ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù).  <s>By the way, they also taste different.</s> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d17/c6e/054/d17c6e0542074684ad2d87c82dae1e2b.jpg"><br><br>  There is such an incomprehensible thing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e3/7b3/e00/1e37b3e00ed5427ba80f812967a58b7e.jpg"><br><br>  The incomprehensible thing is the ‚ÄúOne Ring‚Äù, the player‚Äôs control panel that is worn on the finger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20f/4bf/42d/20f4bf42db6141d788729906e6e5ccfd.jpg"><br><br>  Another kit includes an incomprehensible type of coupler, the use of which can be found if you read the instructions.  But with the instruction there is some troubles ... the fact is that the package bundle did without a certain amount of pieces of paper-which-no-one-reads-but-stores.  You can find it on the device, carefully packed in a ZIP archive.  So, the use of this "screed" - fixing headphones in the "swimming" mode.  Just in case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a15/3f9/670/a153f9670eed42be99df495c11e3964a.jpg"><br><br>  The rest of the gadget justifies 4 letters SONY on the case - at 100%.  Just look at the photos, even the words are useless: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/662/594/bcb/662594bcb87b4e328581af80f385c9ec.jpg"><br><br>  Gentle, simple, understandable.  The device is pleasant both to hold in hands, and "to stick" in ears: sits as poured. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9b/e3d/baa/e9be3dbaa7044e0d843f7dc3f9848763"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Usability</font> </h2><br>  Part of the controls is placed on the headphones themselves and carefully signed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5b/124/557/f5b1245575b546ecb455813cc9b1454b.jpg"><br><br>  In principle, everything is clear with them.  Their location requires habituation, but so with any wearable electronics, first you suffer, then you get used to it, then you swear at all the changes that are made in the following models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18c/8b8/dea/18c8b8dead724d4d878ac0f0e4b76c71"><br><br>  I was pleasantly pleased not so much by the set of buttons on the headphones, as by the funny ‚Äúring‚Äù that connects to them via Bluetooth 4.0 LE and allows you to control the device without attracting the attention of others and not making any extra movements at all.  Trying to get on the run in the small buttons of the headphones to switch the track - a dubious pleasure, but with a ring - no problem, clicked and ready. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/395/4c4/e0a/3954c4e0a5644b28ae67dcb577e478d1.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, the sly Japanese thought that BT would not work under water, so the instructions and the website clearly state that the console is prohibited to be immersed in water.  But it is protected from splashes, and not just anyhow, but according to the IPX 5 standard. On the one hand, it‚Äôs logical that a couple of good hands waving, hitting the water, and you will be as upset as Gollum‚Äôs - it will not be easy to look for ‚Äúcharm‚Äù at the bottom of the pool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/867/8cb/29d/8678cb29df5a47dabcb2d6ea8896a3dd.jpg"><br><br>  On the other hand, the problem with changing the track on the headphones has not disappeared anywhere, on the go, sorry, it's not convenient to do it afloat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d9/1d4/a56/3d91d4a5606f4ed4838d19b8c2e9637e.jpg"><br><br>  Well, a few words about the docking station - everything in it is wonderful, except for two small problems.  First: without it, you will not throw the music, nor will you charge the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d6/eb0/89a/0d6eb089a66642149c862161899d347c.jpg"><br><br>  A rubber plug with MicroUSB is simply not provided for it (and, to be honest, there simply is no space left on the device for it). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c81/925/faa/c81925faa8904c11b1e6a9946e1fde15.jpg"><br><br>  The second one: firm (tm) software (tm) - typically SONY-style, thinks he knows better what the user needs.  Just send a music folder to the player through it - a feat. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/888/61f/d75/88861fd757234c30bef3956981a17dd8.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/418/bbc/cd4/418bbccd4df64bce9a882fafaa903bb0.png"><br>  Fortunately, no one bothers to use the classic way: pick up the player without software and upload music, like on a flash drive.  So take care of your dock from an early age.  Surely it stands apart as half of the new headphones. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Personal experience</font> </h2><br>  The device is sitting well "in the ears" after you pick up the "gags" of the correct size.  In principle, after some acclimatization, the player is almost not felt.  It does not interfere with running, jumping - also, just as with your head, do not shake - it doesn't fall out of your ears. <br><br>  Swimming is a bit more complicated.  First, you must carefully remove the "pedestrian" liners, which also have moisture protection, but do not provide tightness during the dive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8e/36a/0f5/c8e36a0f51474957b710c7724a551535.jpg"><br><br>  Instead of transitional ones, it is necessary to select suitable ‚Äúswimming‚Äù plugs for the size and quality of the ear.  By the way, the instructions indicate that you can ‚Äúbathe‚Äù (and take a shower) without changing the usual, ‚Äúwaterproof‚Äù inserts.  But the special waterproof ones are needed just for swimming, so that the water does not get inside and you can hear the music well. <br><br>  Secondly, the sound quality under water with such inserts (and indeed the perception of music) is somewhat different, and the flow of water ‚Äúpushes‚Äù somewhat on the headphones and they simply ‚Äúfeel‚Äù in the ear, as if the ears are slightly laying.  Nothing criminal, but unusual.  Thirdly, if you suddenly work with a coach, then you can not hear his whistle, but listening to music with a coach is somehow uncivilized even :) <br><br>  As for playing your favorite tracks in the classic mode - the acoustic qualities of the player are far from decent reinforcement headphones, like the same <a href="http://ru.creative.com/p/headphones-headsets/aurvana-in-ear3">Creative Aurvana In-Ear 3</a> , which I consider to be one of the best <b>relatively inexpensive</b> headphones of this format.  Ultimate Ears, made on an individual impression of the auricle, of course, pass by because of the horse price tag.  In general, I would call the sound quality of the headphones (!) Of this player from SONY "at C grade".  Well, or on the fourth with a minus.  Slightly worse than the <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/168184">Sennheiser CX-300-II Precision</a> , slightly better than the ‚Äújunior‚Äù model <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/196956">Sennheiser CX-200-II STREET</a> , but still, the form factor of the device is very different from ‚Äújust headphones‚Äù. <br><br>  While jogging, you definitely will not be able to enjoy the virtuoso performance of a work by Vivaldi, and you are unlikely to swim to the vocal masterpieces of three tenors.  The noise of your own breathing and blood flow will completely drown out all air, pure and sublime, like all signals from Mars.  And to listen to rhythmic music, designed to maintain the rhythm of movements and create the necessary background - perfect fit. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt see the point of describing platitudes, like connecting to a smartphone as a headset in view of the obviousness of the process and the result - of course, everything works and does not require dancing with a tambourine.  Moreover, when you first connect the player as a headset, it will offer you to download a branded application (and open the application page in the corresponding store - Google Play or the AppStore. Voice prompts and notifications on the player, unfortunately, are only in English, but they sound nice. <br><br>  Yes, for Android and iOS, there is a proprietary application!  It allows you to <s>control the device</s> to suffer from the quality of Japanese software: you can, of course, adjust the equalizer for ‚Äúoffline‚Äù playback, but even the obvious copying of music from a smartphone to a player is not implemented. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Results</font> </h2><br>  In general, and reviews about the device on the Internet, and personal experience, too, do not refute one simple truth, it was possible to do better: for some reason, no one has yet done so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5dd/333/2ce/5dd3332ce81049128e654e24c35007c3"><br><br>  <b>Advantages and disadvantages</b> <br>  + Underwater player!  Wow <br>  + When jogging does not interfere, does not jump, does not press on the ears; <br>  + When swimming almost does not interfere; <br>  + Sea liners for any size of ear; <br>  + Nice design, not bad hold a charge; <br>  + Excellent work as a headset; <br>  + Remote-ring taxis; <br>  - The price bites; <br>  - The quality of audio playback is for a threesome / dash with a minus; <br>  - Work only through the docking station; <br>  - Japanese software is Japanese. <br><br>  Legendary model, bestseller and player of the year, this thing is not called, but she does not claim.  But the unique features and the opportunity to practice your favorite sports under the creativity of your favorite <s>Ranetok</s> musicians is cool.  We are waiting for the third version, but for now ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/54b/5ed/deb/54b5eddeb8a04fa4a52d881dc90a5984.jpg"><br><br>  While we really have ‚Äúnot a drop of superfluous‚Äù: the device copes with its task of a sports player, the additional feature in the form of a headset works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e62/483/097/e62483097f9a45a9ad483573dcc0b10f"><br><br>  You can buy from us in Yulmart, and almost a thousand cheaper than on the official SONY website: just <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/1021090">7,800</a> rubles.
