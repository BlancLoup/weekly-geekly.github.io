      About the products of the American company Taser International! <br><br>  Let me remind you that under this brand pistols are produced, which, unlike ordinary stun guns, allow stopping a criminal or a suspect from a certain distance.  In other cases, as it turns out, stop forever. <br><br>  The last time the company lit up was a joint development with iRobot Corporation, in which for the first time it was decided to combine stun guns with a combat (police) tracked robot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/4ae/647/159/4ae6471593f6eb57f0065428ed16f2d9.jpg" width="230" height="336" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  The novelty has not yet received a special name, and in general, as reported on the project page, this promising technology is only at the very beginning of its development.  The robot in the video, obviously, while modeled on the computer. <br><br>  But Taser International was not limited to this idea.  She introduced two more new products designed to bring shock technology to a new level. <br><br>  The first is the ‚ÄúExtended Range Electronic Projectile‚Äù (eXtended Range Electronic Projectile - XREP). <br><br>  It carries the same neuromuscular electrical stunner that works in a Taser X26 shocker pistol.  But if in the latter the 50-kilovolt discharge is delivered to the target by a pair of firing wires (which can be thrown up to 10.6 meters), then the XREP projectile ‚Äúloads‚Äù into a standard police 12-round shotgun and flies to a distance of 30.5 meters .  And no wires behind him stretches. <br><br>  A key part of the new projectile is the "engine" XREP.  This refers to the electronics unit that supplies the discharge.  It weighs only 2.4 grams (the entire projectile pulls on 14 grams) and takes, along with the battery, very little space.  The block is built into the transparent shell of the projectile; therefore, such a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù at first glance can be distinguished from the usual charge of a shotgun. <br><br>  After the shot, the broken cord stretched between the shell and the sleeve activates the XREP, so that it flies out of the barrel ready for action.  By the way, XREP takes off at a speed of 91 meters per second.  For a nominal range of 30 meters, this is quite a decent speed. <br><br>  In flight, XREP uncovers three small stabilizers that spin it around the longitudinal axis to increase the accuracy of the hit (a smooth-bore shotgun is used to launch the projectile). <br><br>  When hitting the body, the four front electrodes dig into the victim, destroying the protective fairings.  At the same time, a series of connecting rods breaks from the impact, and the main part of the projectile falls down, unwinding the thin Kevlar wiring along the way.  The head of the remains where it fell. <br><br>  At the same time, 6 ‚Äúcactus‚Äù spines are opened to the side from the shell of the shell, which penetrate through clothing and close the resulting chain at a distance of several tens of centimeters from the point of impact (say, between the criminal‚Äôs chest and his legs).  This is where the current is applied, and the cycle of discharges (reaching twenty times a second) lasts as long as 20 seconds.  The effect is stunning. <br><br>  And this is not all the secrets of the projectile.  What if a person tries to tear off the tip with the electrodes?  It turns out that it is equipped with electrodes and on the reverse side, so that when you try to get rid of the projectile, the current goes into the hand. <br><br>  If none of the six ‚Äúcactus‚Äù electrodes of the main body closes the circuit, the voltage will be applied between the nasal electrodes, which can also greatly shock the victim and possibly force her to try to detach the projectile and unwrapped wires from it, which will cause the main circuit to close. <br><br>  In the autumn of this year, he will go to the tests, which will last six months or a year before the novelty is launched into mass production. <br><br>  However, if you think that such a ‚Äúflying lightning‚Äù is the most impressive new development of Taser International - get acquainted with the ‚Äúelectric mine‚Äù - the Shockwave T-RAD (Taser Remote Area Denial) system, which, according to its name, allows you to throw away attackers in within the protected area (or rather, ‚Äúdrop‚Äù them on the ground).  And you can control this entertaining system remotely. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e08/080/1c6/e080801c646cbb96e1c8350713faf43b.jpg" width="450" height="195" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Remote control involves the activation of this device by pressing a button.  But the protected area is a limited space in front of the device (externally, and in function, in something similar to anti-personnel mines of directional action), within which the target will be struck. <br><br>  The Shockwave unit consists of six firing cartridges aimed forward, within a 20-degree sector.  The depth of their affected area is 7.6 meters. <br><br>  At this distance, the cartridges emit sharp electrodes with wires drawn out after them and deliver high-voltage discharges that last 5 seconds to the victim or several victims. <br><br>  Reactivating the arrester can generate an additional 5 seconds of electric shock to ensure that the attacker is pacified. <br><br>  But what is the probability that the wires from the six ‚Äúguns‚Äù will get into at least one criminal who is facing the system?  The company has a wonderful answer to this.  The beauty of the Shockwave kit is that it scales easily. <br><br>  From six-barrel blocks, as if from Lego bricks, it is possible to make a whole wall, building it up even though in breadth (and seizing a larger sector of shelling, in all directions). <br><br>  All blocks in the wall can be activated at the same time, creating a whole cloud of electrodes (flying like shards or striking elements of a mine), which will surely cover a group of attackers. <br><br>  By the way, the used cartridge model (25 XP) is distinguished by the increased penetrating power of the electrodes.  They simply punch clothes better than electrodes of the base model. <br><br>  Where you can install such protective systems - it remains only to fantasize.  But Taser International emphasizes that the principle of Shockwave allows you to create complexes of the most diverse forms, in accordance with the environment and possible dangerous areas. <br><br>  If the reaction of potential customers is positive, the serial release of the Shockwave T-RAD can be launched in 2008. <br><br>  Here it is necessary to add that the abbreviation T-RAD hides not only the Shockwave apparatus, but also one more related installation, built on a similar principle.  The company is positioning it not only as a police officer, but also military equipment, obviously, capable of being useful where exactly non-lethal weapons are required. <br><br>  Unlike the Shockwave, the T-RAD military module is equipped not only with cartridges with departing wires, but also with an infrared camera, for effective protection of the territory (warehouse or military base) at night. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/a8e/fc5/e90/a8efc5e90db637e28c254951d0c838df.jpg" width="450" height="352" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  As conceived by the company, a set of a number of such devices, installed at key points and supplying ‚Äúpictures‚Äù to a single security post, will help in protecting closed territories from intruders. <br><br>  But will it all be effective in real life?  Serious question.  We offer to discuss this to you. <br><br>  And yet it is impossible not to note how fruitful the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãprotecting warehouses and bases is with unusual, remote-controlled weapons.  Let even bring to mind it will have, perhaps, more than one year. <br><br>  Recall that the gunsmiths innovators had somehow created an experienced 30-barrel rapid-fire stun gun.  True, its compactness left much to be desired.  To put it mildly. <br><br>  Well, if nonlethal weapons for the proper protection of the territory is not enough, the inventors will always help the military.  Here you can turn to another very unusual development: ultra-fast "thinking" gun Redback with remote control. <br><br>  Since theoretically it can be equipped with a command radio channel, we again return to the affectionate slogan ‚ÄúWelcome to the world of wireless technologies!‚Äù, Which must be supplied with an additive: "... or no outsiders are allowed." <br><br>  taken from <a href="http://nnm.ru/">NNM</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12622/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12622/</a></p>
