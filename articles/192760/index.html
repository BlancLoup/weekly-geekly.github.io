In other words, we are quite lazy.  Often, new technologies appear and develop precisely because of laziness.  Robot Vacuum Cleaner - another invention, designed to reduce our heavy burden with you.  We have been selling household robots for more than three years.  Many consumers still do not know that besides iRobot, there are other representatives on the market who sometimes have better characteristics.  Another thing is that iRobot first entered the Russian market and invested a lot of money in advertising, therefore brand awareness is very high. <br><br>  We believe that only a few competitive vacuum cleaning robots are commercially available, namely: iRobot Roomba, Yujin Robot iClebo and Neato.  All other vacuum cleaners are worse in many ways, including the quality of cleaning and manufacturing, as well as the lack of normal service.  Since there is no good direct comparison of these brands on the Web, we decided to fill this gap.  We had another interesting brand Moneual with our model MR7700 (in Russia, by mistake known as Rydis R750), we were also not too lazy to add it to the comparative review. <br><br>  So, today the following models of vacuum cleaning robots will compete as cleaning, overcoming thresholds, ease of use and other parameters: iRobot Roomba 780, Moneual MR7700, Yujin Robot iClebo Arte, Neato Robotics XV-11.

This is due to the fact that iRobot is, in principle, the first company in the world that established mass production and sales of vacuum cleaning robots. <br><br>  In Russia, they invest heavily in brand promotion.  In Moscow, advertising can be seen not only in the subway, but even on the highways.  That is why the price of the company's vacuum cleaners is relatively high compared to its competitors.  But the quality of goods at a high level, despite the fact that iRobot is made in China. <br><br>  The most popular model in the line is Roomba 780. The price for it is lower than for the most expensive Roomba 790, which differs, in fact, only by the bundle and other remote control.  At the same time, the 780th has coordinating beacons without which all junior models can generally get lost in 2‚Äì3 room apartments and not reach the base. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f2/99f/9d2/1f299f9d26f903fa752ae95796d9fb0c.jpg" align="left" alt="iclebo arte"><br><br>  Yujin Robot is a Korean company that has been engaged in robotics for many years, with the company focusing on navigation systems in automated devices.  The company even produces caretaker robots. <br><br>  On the Russian market, Koreans appeared about two years ago, first with models of iClebo Home (without navigation) and iClebo Smart (with mapping system), and then with a more advanced model of Arte, which replaced the Smart model.  Arte has a number of characteristics that are superior to those of other brands.  For example, Arte is the only robot on the market capable, according to the manufacturer, to move interior sills up to 20 mm. <br><br>  It is also the only vacuum cleaner capable of working on a single battery charge for up to 160 minutes (in the conditions of the minimum amount of furniture and smooth floors).  Well, of course, he has a mapping system, that is, he is building a map of the premises for the correct selection of the trajectory of cleaning and a quick search of the base.  Adding to all this, high quality product assembly, production in Korea and a good price, we get a strong competitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ff/9f5/95d/6ff9f595da363045747ae58d12e8af82.jpg" align="left" alt="neato xv-11"><br>  Neato Robotics is generally an interesting company.  Having a pretty good product with an integrated mapping system, they have such bad marketing that, in fact, they can only change the colors of the body and offer such a vacuum cleaner as a new older model.  Have iRobot something spied to.  After all, iRobot is essentially one single base of the Roomba 620 model, to which a virtual wall was added to the kit, the price was increased, and the Roomba 630 model was added. The programming option was added and the model was even more expensive - Roomba 650 and so on.  Please note that the battery of all Roomba models is 15 000 rubles, 30 000 has the same capacity, and according to the manufacturer, they remove completely different areas.  Perhaps in the 7xx series models there are some innovations in the cleaning algorithms, and it really does not consume the battery as quickly as the 6xx series, but something is all doubtful.  Rather, for the expansion of the model range, the iRobot simply changes the configuration, adds a new piece and a new model is obtained, sometimes by 10‚Äì15 thousand rubles more. <br><br>  What are we?  And all this is to the fact that Neato also produces its products on the same principle, but it doesn‚Äôt say so explicitly about it and it doesn‚Äôt set the price too high.  We tested the Neato XV-11 model with the latest firmware version (revision).  The older model Neato XV-21 differs from the younger one in a different color of the case, the presence of an additional turbo brush with villi and a slightly different type of filter.  Recently, the new Neato XV Signature and XV Signature Pro series (+2 additional filters included) was announced.  So this ‚Äúnew‚Äù series differs from the Neato XV-21 only in the color of the body and minor changes in the design of the wheels and engines, in view of the frequent breakdowns of the models of the XV-11 and XV-21 series.  For those who doubt, read foreign sources.  By the way, even how clean it can clean up the corners depends on the Neato firmware version.  After all, as you know, for Neato this is a big problem, it does not have side brushes, like other reviewers. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uAizWvAopu8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjSD0ENCKfRxU1N4VizgHdjz-PclQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Thus, we get an interesting robot vacuum cleaner with the possibility of self-firmware, but with poor support in Russia and the presence of some unpleasant moments, which we describe below.  Neato, by the way, is made in China. <br><br>  By the way, iClebo Arte can also be flashed and improved thereby, its behavior and the choice of trajectory.  A vacuum cleaner with firmware version 1.6.3 participated in the review.  You will not be able to flash it yourself, since for this you need to have a programmer and the corresponding software version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f90/81a/783/f9081a7839645663322a73ba2a55736b.jpg" align="left" alt="Moneaul"><br><br>  And finally, Moneaul MR7700 is a very interesting robot in its characteristics.  Judging by the advertising slogans - this is a powerful vacuum cleaner, which has a number of features.  For example, he almost does not touch the furniture, he has a remote with built-in gyroscope. <br><br>  The location of the robot depends on the location of the console in space.  The idea is interesting, but after twenty minutes of such a game you get tired of everything.  You are buying a robot to forget about cleaning, and not to sit for an hour and conduct the remote control ?! <br><br>  In Russia, the name Rydis R750 has stuck to this vacuum cleaner, although in reality these are different vacuum cleaners that look very similar.  In our test, it is the model MR7700, but in order not to embarrass people, we will call it Rydis. <br><br>  Why do we think the above vacuum cleaners are the best?  Because in addition to these models, we still have: <br><br>  <b>DeeBot</b> (Chinese brand Ecovacs), which constantly breaks down, has poor-quality service and, in terms of efficiency and principle of cleaning, is no different from vacuum cleaners of other Chinese brands. <br><br>  <b>RobZone</b> is a pseudo- <b>Austrian</b> brand.  In fact, this is an ordinary Chinese vacuum cleaner, produced at the most famous factory SilverStar, but with a RobZone sticker on the case.  He has no effective distinctive features, only a useless UV lamp on the bottom. <br><br>  <b>Karcher</b> - the robot vacuum cleaner of this company has no side brushes, has a huge base for dumping garbage (in fact, cleaning the dust collector after cleaning any other robot is a minute case), it is absolutely chaotic and has a transcendental cost. <br><br>  <b>Clever &amp; Clean</b> - Chinese vacuum cleaners, analogues of iRobot at a low price.  It has simple motion algorithms and is not considered in the review in view of the fact that they belong to the budget type. <br><br>  <b>Samsung, LG</b> and other Koreans.  Vacuum cleaners of these companies are not common in Russia.  Younger Samsung models didn‚Äôt remove dust effectively, which can be verified from a YouTube video.  We did not deal with older models and we could not find them for review. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qJPuUfcChDI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjLv4Cl8W6cWpBPq2x3bvI2hlzkYw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Thus, iRobot, Neato and iClebo remain the most optimal and efficient cleaning robots for today. <br><br>  So, let's go over our test results. <br><br><h3>  Test 1. Choosing the best route. </h3><br>  The availability of a room mapping system determines the speed of cleaning and the search for a charging station.  Neato is the only vacuum cleaner in the world equipped with a laser range finder that determines the location of obstacles and the structure of the room.  It does not move erratically, like many other devices.  It defines the rectangular zones and cleans them inside them, further moves through the apartment in the same rectangular zones of size.  Approximately 3x4 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57b/f1b/5c4/57bf1b5c4b0283a672eb95214e0ca227.jpg" align="left" alt="neato">  With the search base he has no problems.  In our test, a kitchen with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 30 square meters was used.  Neato was able to remove it in 30 minutes.  This is the best result for the speed of cleaning.  But, unfortunately, he managed to get stuck twice in the most simple places.  He gets stuck under the furniture if she is standing on 10 cm high legs. Neato always chooses her route in different ways, once he can go straight from the base, and next time to the right.  Thus, if you think that you are protecting the site where he was stuck last time, it is not a fact that this time he will not get stuck in a completely new place.  Considering its strong hum during operation (it sounds like a household vacuum cleaner), it is not very convenient to follow it all the time, and it is not always possible to program cleaning and leave while the vacuum cleaner is running.  You will return home, and Neato stands and squeaks plaintively between two chairs.  In our review, this is exactly what happened when it was stuck between the refrigerator and the coat hanger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37a/712/934/37a71293422e5f4afb05ce710c5a0a29.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  A slightly different type of building room map is using the camera.  The iClebo Arte camera, located on the top of the case, takes pictures of the ceiling and walls, drawing the structure of the apartment.  In fact, it is only needed to search for the base, since it measures all distances using a gyroscope and a magnetic sensor on the front wheel axle.  This vacuum cleaner could clean 30 square meters in 35 minutes, which roughly corresponds to the Neato cleaning speed. <br><br>  As for the other participants in our test, everything is not so rosy.  iRobot Roomba 780 with the iAdapt ‚Äúsuper system‚Äù at least outwardly moves absolutely chaotically.  Most likely, unlike Clever &amp; Clean 112, Roomba still determines the size of the room for itself. <br><br>  But it took the robot a full 65 minutes to clean our kitchen and at the same time it leaves small uncleared areas.  What to say about large apartments, where you need to clean up to 100 square meters (this vacuum cleaner is designed for such an area). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae7/81a/e6c/ae781ae6ccb23d4e0cadb6118dff26b0.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  To compensate for the lack of a mapping system, Roomba uses coordinator beacons placed in doorways.  This is not very convenient, since batteries are quickly planted in them, especially if the robot starts up independently on a timer. <br><br>  Rydis is an interesting specimen.  At the beginning, it starts moving in straight lines, like an iClebo.  But after the first collisions with obstacles, he changes his route beyond recognition and moves almost as chaotically as Roomba 780. Strange behavior.  The time spent on cleaning it is about the same as that of iRobot, which means that for large rooms it is also not very effective.  But what is most unpleasant, it becomes so bad at the base that at the first start it did not get at the base even from the fifth time.  And it is in a fairly simple room. <br><br>  <i>According to the results of the test, iClebo Arte and Neato XV-11 showed the best results of cleaning time and optimal route selection.</i>  <i>iRobot Roomba 780 and Rydis R750 are cleaned for a long time and inefficiently choose the path.</i> <br><br><h3>  Test 2. Work on black surfaces. </h3><br>  Why is this test so important?  The fact is that all robot vacuum cleaners have height sensors in their arsenal that prevent the device from falling from a height, for example, from a ladder.  If the signal from the surface is not reflected, then there is emptiness under the robot, and it immediately stops and travels in the opposite direction.  Black surfaces tend to absorb a signal, so a vacuum cleaner may refuse to drive on a black laminate or tile.  On hand we had: a black matte table, black floor tiles and a dark brown lacquered table. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e0/213/44b/3e021344bb3b51db3f9d0c3bb4b0497f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In the process of testing our participants it turned out that all vacuum cleaners cope without any problems with dark surfaces.  The only problem came with the Korean iClebo robot.  And (this is not shown in the video), in the overcoming mode of the gaps, the robot also easily moves across the black matt table, but as soon as we turn off this mode, the robot believes that there is nothing under it and to spin in place.  This is because, depending on the override mode, the sensors of the iClebo change their sensitivity.  If this did not happen, the vacuum cleaner, having stopped on the poroshek, would have decided that the emptiness is further, because its body has risen above the floor.  He would give a reverse course and did not overcome the threshold. <br><br>  <i>According to the test results, only iClebo Arte experienced minor difficulties when working on a black matte surface.</i>  <i>Other test participants coped with the task.</i> <br><br><h3>  Test 3. Overcoming thresholds. </h3><br>  An important test for many consumers is the ability to overcome interior thresholds.  In fact, this indicator also affects whether the robot vacuum cleaner will enter the carpet or refuse to do so.  Vacuum cleaner iClebo Arte has a special mode that can be activated using the remote control.  In this mode, according to the manufacturer, the vacuum cleaner can overcome powders up to 20 mm.  Other vacuum cleaners do not have such modes.  Neato behaves in an interesting way, he feels that he sees this threshold with his laser rangefinder and immediately tries to get at him at an angle, first with one wheel and then with another.  With a direct race (we did not show this in the video), Neato could not overcome the 15 mm threshold in our place. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f31/508/0c6/f315080c63987f7dd0a5853dde7c0b39.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>According to the test results, we were surprised that the iClebo Arte can not only overcome 20 mm, but with a direct hit with its cruising speed, it overcomes all 22 mm.</i>  <i>This is a record among robot vacuum cleaners.</i>  <i>iRobot also showed itself well, quite confidently overcoming thresholds up to 15 mm inclusive.</i>  <i>Neato stuck on our doorstep 22 mm.</i>  <i>About Rydis generally silent, more than 1 cm he can not overcome.</i> <br><br><h3>  Test 4. Quality of cleaning. </h3><br>  For this test, we protected a small rectangular area.  The following was used as garbage: coins of 10 kopecks, buckwheat, tea and dry breakfast.  Since our tiles are smooth, all the rubbish could easily fly off the case of the vacuum cleaner due to the absence of friction with the floor.  It also complicates the work of the participants.  All vacuum cleaners equipped with side brushes, manage to scatter garbage, if it comes across on the edge of the brush.  Neato is not equipped with brushes, so it is easier for him to collect garbage inside the perimeter.  But he can not collect dust from the edge: along the walls and in the corners.  Some stores position the Neato as the most efficient vacuum cleaner to collect dust in the corners because of its square shape.  Apparently sellers have never seen Neato moving along walls.  He does not try to drive into a corner, but bends around him, and it is precisely along the walls and corners that all the garbage accumulates.  As you can see, there is no ideal robot vacuum cleaner, either it doesn‚Äôt clean well in the center, but well along the walls, or vice versa. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84d/769/bb6/84d769bb64ad4061bef0cc70004a2126.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  As in the first test, iRobot and Rydis spent more time cleaning than Neato and iClebo.  At the same time, iRobot decided that it was enough for him to get out and got on the base even when there was still quite a lot of garbage on the site.  Rydis did the same.  Only iRobot grabbed the bulk of the garbage closer to the base, and Rydis just scattered it all over the site.  It is worth noting that Rydis has several modes of operation, which differ in suction power.  We are ready to argue that no one will be able to use this absolutely useless function, because any robot vacuum cleaner and so the suction power is several times less than that of a domestic colleague.  So why should he put even less power?  Rydis could not collect a single coin.  But advertising says this is the most powerful vacuum cleaner on the market.  How so? <br><br>  iClebo Arte and Neato XV-11 showed very good cleaning results.  If iClebo perfectly cleaned every corner and along the walls, then Neato, on the contrary, did an excellent job of cleaning in the center of the site.  We want to answer the most common question: which robot cleaner is more powerful?  Absorption power is not indicated almost anywhere, because in fact (attention, a terrible secret!), You buy not a vacuum cleaner, but electrobroom.  And you do not need to hope that this fashionable device alone will clean all floors without your intervention.  From time to time, you still have to do a general cleaning with a household vacuum cleaner.  But with their task, sweeping floors and collecting dust, wool and hair, robotic vacuum cleaners cope perfectly with the use of a turbo brush.  So, returning to the question, according to our feelings, the most powerful robot on the market is Neato.  At the same time, he is buzzing like an airplane taking off the entire cleaning cycle.  All other vacuum cleaners suck up about the same, that iRobot, that iClebo, that Rydis.  In practice, the quality of cleaning depends more on the correct navigation and route selection.  That is why the quality of cleaning iRobot, worse than those of the same iClebo and Neato. <br><br>  <i>Test results tell us that iRobot and Rydis do not work out their money and consumer expectations.</i>  <i>Remains quite a lot of garbage that vacuum cleaners scatter around the site.</i>  <i>iClebo coped very well with cleaning and is suitable for use on smooth floors.</i>  <i>Neato, in turn, is more likely to be suitable for cleaning on carpet with a low pile.</i>  <i>Since he will be able to suck the dust due to the increased suction power of the motor in comparison with competitors.</i>  <i>At the same time, Neato will leave trash in the most littering places: along the walls and in the corners.</i> <br><br><h3>  Test 5. Operation and service. </h3><br>  We specially selected testing for used robots for several months.  During this time, the owners were able to tell us their impressions and mention the financial costs of the service.  This is also an important indicator, because by contacting the Neato, you will be tormented for a long time with the search for filters.  And if the turbo brush gets messed up, then it‚Äôs quite a disaster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/157/ae5/e92/157ae5e92f98b11013e3aa8dcf054e22.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  But let's order.  iRobot is a company that has an official representative in Russia and therefore there are no problems with the service.  Components are not always available for sale, but in general there are no problems.  Filters can wait another week.  As for the vacuum cleaner itself, our copy works for about six months.  He works 3-4 times a week.  During this time, the side brush was slightly deformed.  The battery in the vacuum cleaner is nickel metal hydride, which is not very good.  You need to take care of it, discharge it to the end and charge it completely.  Battery life of this type is not long.  The vacuum cleaner began to discharge faster during operation.  The iRobot representative office says that as soon as you remove the battery seal, you need to immediately charge 16 hours for charging.  This is how they make sure that you rarely contact the service center.  In general, problems with a vacuum cleaner does not occur. <br><br>  About Rydis R750 can not say much.  As far as we know, only two companies in Russia are more or less actively importing this robot.  Accordingly, they carry out repairs themselves.  We managed to find a service only in Moscow.  While using the vacuum cleaner, there were no difficulties.  He worked all 4 months regularly.  It is difficult to find filters on it, but they are brought to order.  The battery here is excellent - iron-phosphate. <br><br>  Yujin Robot has a representative office in Russia.  In particular, a vacuum cleaner can be handed over for repair to service centers in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  In other cases, you will need to send a vacuum cleaner in consultation with the service center.  With iClebo Arte also no hassle.  The side brushes do not deteriorate at all, the turbo brush is cleaned and rinsed, as is the dust collector with a filter.  Components are always on sale.  The robot uses a lithium-ion battery, which has a much smaller memory effect than the nickel-metal hydride battery and serves for a long time without noticeable loss of power. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffa/cea/e52/ffaceae527c332da65e1af6d69ba1c96.jpg" alt="image"><br>  With Neato XV-11, everything is really bad.  Filters are consumed quickly.  They are thin and are torn when repeated washing.  Buy new - a huge problem.  It is easier to learn how to use eBay and buy there, than to ask importers to bring the order for fabulous prices.  Our user vacuum cleaner all the time drives under the sofa and kitchen set, from this he has many scratches on the cover of the case.  It uses a nickel metal hydride battery. <br><br>  <i>The results of the test tell us that the least trouble arises with the iRobot Roomba 780 and iClebo Arte vacuum cleaners.</i>  <i>But with Neato there may be problems that you cannot solve even through the stores where you purchased this product.</i> <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  According to the test results, the Korean robot vacuum cleaner iClebo Arte takes the first place, which, with high quality cleaning, has high performance and unique features like overcoming thresholds, built-in mapping system and even the possibility of wiping floors with microfiber cloth (which is useful only in case of cleaning fine dust, flour).  iClebo scored 23 points out of 25. <br><br>  iRobot and Neato shared second place with 20 points.  Neato is smart, but with the support of this product in Russia, everything is very bad.  And, being so smart, he constantly strives to get stuck.  iRobot, on the contrary, is silly, but you will not have problems with the service. <br><br>  But Rydis, we lose in almost all parameters at a price higher than competitors. <br><br><h3>  Comparative table of robot vacuum cleaners </h3><br><table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  iRobot Roomba 780 </td><td>  Moneual MR7700 </td><td>  Yujin Robot iClebo Arte </td><td>  Neato XV-11 </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Dimensions, cm</strong> </td><td>  35x9.1 </td><td>  32x7.9 </td><td>  34x8.9 </td><td>  32x10.2 </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Weight, kg</strong> </td><td>  3.7 </td><td>  3.2 </td><td>  2.8 </td><td>  five </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Battery type</strong> </td><td>  NiMh (3000 mAh) </td><td>  LiFePO4 (1400 mA / h) </td><td>  Li-Ion (2200 mA / h) </td><td>  NiMH (3500 mAh) </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Cleaning time, min</strong> </td><td>  90 </td><td>  60 </td><td>  160 </td><td>  90 </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Charging time, min</strong> </td><td>  180 </td><td>  60 </td><td>  90 </td><td>  180 </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Mapping system</strong> </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Rubbing floors with microfiber</strong> </td><td>  not </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Remote control included</strong> </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Touchscreen</strong> </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  not </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Automatic installation on the base</strong> </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Distance and height sensors</strong> </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Noise level</strong> </td><td>  65 dB </td><td>  55 dB </td><td>  55 dB </td><td>  77 dB </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>The number of side brushes</strong> </td><td>  one </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  0 </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Producing country</strong> </td><td>  China </td><td>  Korea </td><td>  Korea </td><td>  China </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Warranty, years</strong> </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Official representative</strong> </td><td>  <a href="http://irobot.ru/">http://irobot.ru</a> </td><td>  not </td><td>  <a href="http://iclebo.com.ru/">http://iclebo.com.ru</a> </td><td>  not </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192760/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192760/</a></p>
