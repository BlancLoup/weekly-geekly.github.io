  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Belgian newspapers sued Google News</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2363584,00.html">The verdict of the Belgian court</a> says: <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> must remove the content of several Belgian newspapers from the index within a week.  Otherwise, the search giant will be forced to pay a daily fine of? 1 million. A separate penalty is provided for Google if the company fails to publish the court decision on its website within ten days.  In this case, the Americans will be forced to pay? 500 thousand per day. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Brussels Court of First Instance made such a strange decision on the grounds that because of <a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News,</a> "the publishers of the daily press are losing control over their websites and their content."  Because of the news search engine, traffic to the sites of newspapers is allegedly reduced, because users get all the necessary information from a brief squeeze on the Google News pages.  Such a statement is quite controversial, because in fact Google provides up to 25% of the traffic of any news site and in reality increases its traffic. <br><br>  The cause of claims from the publishers can also be understood, because Google, in fact, makes money on someone else's content, while the creators of this content and its owners do not receive a single penny from Google.  Google discouraged by the fact that there is no advertising on Google News (of course, these are not very convincing excuses). <br><br>  As soon as Google found out about the decision of the Belgian court (for her it was also a surprise), of course, the company's lawyers immediately appealed.  After all, such a judgment puts an end to the business model on which the Internet search is based.  Not only search by news, but also search by web is based on indexing someone else's content and issuing this content through a search engine.  If such a model is recognized illegal, then Google and all other search engines will have to enter into copyright agreements with each website separately.  This will change the entire legal basis of business in the modern Internet.  Therefore, even such a petty decision of the district Belgian court caused such a big buzz in the Internet community.

      The decision of the Belgian court was taken at the suit of the agency Copiepress, which brings together the interests of several French-speaking and one German-speaking newspaper in Belgium.  The agency requires Google to enter into direct contracts with newspapers and pay holders for the use of their content. <br><br>  Similar claims to Google have already been put forward by a number of other rightholders, including the French agency France Presse, the American publisher Perfect 10 and some others. <br><br>  Google‚Äôs position is clear: with the slightest claim from the copyright holder, its content is immediately removed from the index.  If any newspaper wants this, then all she needs to do is write a letter to the appropriate Google department. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4420/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4420/</a></p>
