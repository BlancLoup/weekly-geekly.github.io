At the same time and there it was possible to read that the experts of the League of Safe Internet (LBI) believe that hentai - this is child porn.  (‚ÄúIf Roskomnadzor asks for an examination, our expert center will prepare an opinion. We will most likely say that this is child <nobr>pornography,‚Äù</nobr> announced LBI director Denis Davydov.) <br><br>  <b>So it happened.</b>  Yesterday (June 13) in the news " <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/551864">Roskomnadzor recognized cartoons for child pornography</a> " on the Izvestia website, it became possible to read that "the experts had no doubt that the animated heroes are represented in the image of minors and at the same time participate in pornographic scenes."  The Office asked Muscovite Golovanov to file a second complaint: Roskomnadzor announced that after this, animated videos recognized by child pornography would be entered in the register of prohibited resources.  The intention of Anton Korobkov-Zemlyansky (member of the Public Chamber) to amend the law ‚ÄúOn protecting children from information harmful to their health and development‚Äù is also mentioned, adding animation (including three-dimensional) to the concept of pornography. <br><br>  This change in law enforcement can and should be considered a qualitative change.  Not a video of the fact of sexual intercourse with a real child, and <nobr>not</nobr> even <nobr>any</nobr> live-action <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE">movie</a> with the participation of live actors, but only a graphic artistic image, and not based on real events (for example, obtained by <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">rotoscoping</a> photos or sketching of <nobr>children-models)</nobr> the free fantasy of graphic artists, was nevertheless recognized as similar to child porn.  Legally similar.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  This sense of justice, in which the depiction of a phenomenon is considered to be the phenomenon itself, is an example of a magical consciousness that dominated, for example, over the mind of primitive tribes of primitive people who decorated the walls of their caves with images of successful hunting and hoping thereby to help real hunting.  But it is impossible not to see that the situation in the modern Internet is rather the opposite of the situation in the Paleolithic cave: the unlicensed distribution of hand-drawn pornography is not likely to accompany, but confronts the black market of real child porn, that is, it deprives the video of real corruption of real children of <nobr>any</nobr> economic benefit.  In addition, the pictorial depiction of pedophilia could previously be used in satirical caricatures aimed against pedophiles, and now such cartoonists are legally ranked pedophiles.  Is this a reward they deserve? <br><br>  This sense of justice also begins to seriously threaten the freedom of artistic creation, that is, it threatens to restrict freedom (threatens with prison) to both authors and viewers of a rather indefinite circle of works of art - I write ‚Äúindefinite‚Äù because for an expert who is ready to consider the inessential barrier between and by the fiction (or symbol) of an event, there can be no more barriers.  We see this in real criminal cases abroad, where even the voluntary refusal of the author of the work from the image of people does not make this work untenable. <br><br>  This is how, for example, <nobr>in New Zealand, they</nobr> <a href="http://russian.rt.com/article/7857">gave ten years</a> for a cartoon depicting sexual acts not even between people, but between other humanoids ‚Äî elves and fairies, who, thanks to the peculiarities of Japanese animation (large eyes, large heads, etc.) and Japanese voice acting (thin voices, bright emotions) seemed to experts "similar to children". <br><br>  On this occasion, it is impossible not to recall the caricatures that appeared <a href="http://ntv.livejournal.com/319331.html%3Fstyle%3Dmine">last night</a> , the author of which as if asks us if the day after tomorrow will be recognized as a ‚Äúsymbol of child porn‚Äù, for example, this photo? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e1/9a7/db3/7e19a7db36a5c2be49ec1f13f864c743.jpg" alt="[caricature]"><br><br>  In addition, is it possible to hope that the magic consciousness of the troglodytes (‚Äúthe symbol of the phenomenon is the phenomenon itself‚Äù) will be limited to law enforcement practice in pedophilia cases?  In no way impossible. <br><br>  Didn‚Äôt we read about how the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158367/">site about the game EVE Online</a> , which described the use of fictional chemicals to fictional characters <nobr>, was</nobr> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158367/">closed down</a> <nobr>for ‚Äúdrugs‚Äù</nobr> ? <br><br>  Didn‚Äôt we read about how, under the pretext of child suicide, <a href="http://www.e1.ru/news/spool/news_id-385971.html">withdraw the sale of</a> Death Note manga in the Sverdlovsk region?  (And it should be noted that there the whole region is named after one of the Jewish organizers of the murder of <b>all the</b> children of the Last Emperor - <nobr>but this is something the</nobr> authorities don‚Äôt care about. Guess why.) <br><br>  And there is, there is still where to move them.  Let us take, for example, the opinion quoted by Izvestia from the director of the Open Russian festival of animated films Alexander Gerasimov (general director of the domestic studio Master-Film), who in April <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/548394">joined</a> the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãblacklisting those works that contain juvenile drawn characters: <br><br>  - At Western international animation festivals, we see all sorts of murders, dismemberment, blood, river.  In general, the horror that is happening.  And such films <nobr>receive prizes,</nobr> Gerasimov notes. <br><br>  (End of quote.) <br><br>  Well, you understand. <br><br>  And to visualize the meaning of this text in the mind is best suited to the finale of <a href="http://mangachan.ru/online/61026-a-girl-by-the-sea_v1_ch8.html">page 15 of the</a> eighth chapter of the manga ‚ÄúUmibe no Onnanoko‚Äù, which also contains artistic scenes of sexual intercourse of drawn characters resembling minors. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Manga fragment "Umibe no Onnanoko"</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f43/4a5/c7f/f434a5c7fd3c02fd601823bc06a21190.png" alt="[Manga fragment &quot;Umibe no Onnanoko&quot;]"></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183304/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183304/</a></p>
