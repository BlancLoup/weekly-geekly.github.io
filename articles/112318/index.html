Fine!  We hang drums on our chests, unfold banners with the logo and friendly formation, we enter the company to embody the owner's intention. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After a couple of months, the picture resembles the Germans near Moscow.  The drums were taken away, and the banners were somehow all in the holes and slightly smoked.  One of the reasons for what is happening may be that the introduction of a new system disrupts the already existing and well-established order!  Even if the company mess.  Bardak is from the point of view of the implementers and the manager, and for certain groups of employees, even very much is in order and no one is allowed to violate this order.

      Next, I want to share observations on the implementation of management systems in small enterprises.  I do not pretend to describe the whole typology of personalities, I use only my own experience, perhaps, to whom I can help. <br><br>  <strong>Cardinals are gray but honest</strong> <br>  Usually it is close to the owner or leader of people who have an impact on one or both on two ears.  Mainly related by family ties, be it a wife, brother, matchmaker, etc.  They are characterized by an excellent analytical mind and good intuition.  They control 60 - 80% of business processes in an enterprise, sometimes they possess more information than the owner or manager.  Usually they do not seek open management, but do it in the ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù.  By virtue of kinship, there are no gray schemes in relation to cash flows, although, of course, there may be exceptions, but I only saw this in the movies. <br><br>  Now some signs by which it is possible to determine the impact of this type.  Yesterday you talked with the owner about the large-scale plans for the upcoming modernization of the enterprise, and today you see or feel how something has changed: there is no enthusiasm, short and abrupt phrases, does not support the topic, rather, wants to get rid of you.  In general, a dramatic change in attitudes regarding you or your activities.  These signs may mean that you have crossed the road to the gray, but honest cardinal, then the KCU.  If you do not make it an ally, it will resemble an attack with a sword on the tanks. <br><br>  Let's look at the situation from the point of view of the KSC.  You more or less manage the enterprise, they listen to you, it turns out more than it does not work out and then they ‚Äúarrived‚Äù, they almost say to you that you are no longer the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù.  To eliminate this obstacle it is necessary: ‚Äã‚Äã1. Make sure that the KSCh understands that you will not intercept or destroy its control system, much less impose your own.  2. Take advantage of his "innate" ability to manage in the "kitchen", i.e.  make sure that he comes to advice to you before making a decision.  To do this, you need to work a little and understand what difficulties the management of the KSCh is experiencing and build a strategy so that he himself draws conclusions in favor of the new system.  As an example, I will give the following situation in abbreviated form: <br><br>  Me: Tell me, are you currently satisfied with the wage system in the enterprise? <br>  KSCH: In principle, yes, everything suits, we very carefully developed it (notes of pride). <br>  I am fine!  Tell me, how do the working personnel relate to their immediate duties, do you like everything in their work? <br>  KSCH: Well, of course not everything, every enterprise has flaws. <br>  Me: You can find out what exactly? <br>  KSCH: It happens that installing products at the customer does not check it for quality, they immediately run to another object. <br>  I: And where does this attitude lead to? <br>  KSCH: Complaints from customers, we have to redo some objects, we apologize, we make discounts. <br>  I: Have you ever wondered why the masters are in a hurry? <br>  KSCH: Well, it's obvious, they are sitting on a deal, the more they establish ... (there is a pause) the more they earn. <br>  Me: Did you try to do something with this? <br>  KSCH: Fines were imposed, objects were given, say, not ‚Äútasty‚Äù, some were fired. <br>  I: Helped? <br>  KSCH: Yes, for two or three weeks it helps, then again they stand on the same rails. <br>  Me: Is there a sense of command? <br>  KSCH: To be honest, I would like more ... <br>  I: And what exactly? <br>  KSCH: I want the guys to support the organization too. <br>  I: What if with the help of business logic, which is incorporated in the ‚ÄúX‚Äù program, you can create a team from individualists, and the basis of the team will be supported by them independently? <br>  KSCH: And what is the job? <br><br>  <strong>Real gray cardinal</strong> <br>  A real gray cardinal, hereinafter referred to as the NSC, always has gray schemes in relation to cash flows, or has a ‚Äúconcealed sinner‚Äù before the enterprise.  For convenience, we divide them into two types.  The first type is those who, like KSC, are close to the owner or manager.  Usually they work from the very foundation of the enterprise and also have an effect on the ears of the manager or owner. <br><br>  The second type is those who are close to the KSC, i.e.  close friend or friend in the enterprise.  This species is most often either a neighbor in the staircase or a childhood friend and does not directly influence the owner or manager, but controls through a ‚Äúconfidant‚Äù i.e.  cardinal gray but honest. <br><br>  Signs by which you can identify a real gray cardinal: <br><br>  1. NSC will ignore almost all the tasks. <br>  2. Will violate the pre-established implementation rules. <br>  3. With the frequency of rotation of the electron around the nucleus will indicate errors, and the owner will find out about errors "online" and God forbid, if these are real errors! <br>  4. Setting conditions such as "either me or him." <br>  5. Excuses: I did not go to work because I am not satisfied with the logistics system in your program. <br>  6. Charges: This is not the organization, and you are not the one and everything was normal before you, as soon as you came to our place, sales went down ... <br>  7. Depreciation: I can not use the underdeveloped system, I wonder the brain that is, the one who developed the system? <br><br>  <strong>Now about the main thing</strong> <br>  You will never make an ally from a real gray cardinal, just forget about it!  You have opposite goals.  The NSC wants to hide activities, the KIS has the ability to open and make the business transparent, at least for the owner or manager.  It is possible to neutralize the NSC, but at the same time make sure that the allies have the owner, or the cardinal is gray, but honest.  When neutralizing the NSC, there is one important condition: An implementer or a group of implementers must have the ability to quickly penetrate into existing business processes, quickly compare these data with the implemented scheme and draw clear conclusions about whether it will be worse or better.  So, the NSC will always be afraid of open debate with the owner or manager!  As soon as a real understanding of existing business processes in an enterprise appears in the arsenal, you can openly compare them with how this will be changed in the new system and which undercurrents will cease to exist. <br><br>  PS: There was only one case when I lost in open polemics, it turned out that the real gray cardinal had more influence than expected.  However, after about eight months, the owner reported that ‚Äúby chance‚Äù, they discovered a scheme according to which this comrade merged nearly 500 tr.  For half a year!  This I mean that the signs are signs, and the article is not a panacea. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112318/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112318/</a></p>
