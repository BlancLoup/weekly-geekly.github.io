  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The main thing is to know where to hit.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This story is told about the great experimental physicist of the last century, Peter Leonidovich Kapitsa.  And it refers to the time when he lived and worked in Europe, in the laboratory of Rutherford. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The owner of one factory was extremely concerned.  The steam generator, which was provided with light and energy to his whole plant, vibrated heavily.  This is a very complex problem, the general solution of which does not exist even now.  Many experts tried to fix it, but all their attempts were unsuccessful. <br>  ‚ÄúTime is money,‚Äù the factory owner repeated to himself, counting losses due to lost production, ‚Äútime is money.‚Äù <br>  At that moment, a man in a blue jumpsuit looked into his office. <br>  ‚ÄúI can fix your boiler, sir,‚Äù he said. <br>  The manufacturer was not impressed. <br>  - I invited the best of the best specialists to repair the steam boiler, but none of them could help me.  Look at yourself, you have only a small bag with tools, and there are not so many tools in it, if I am not mistaken. <br>  - That's right, sir.  I took only those tools that will be useful to me to do this work.  So you let your problem settle? <br>  The worker did not impress the manufacturer, but since he had nothing to lose, he led him to the room where the boiler was located.  In the center of the room was the boiler itself.  From him in all directions a huge number of pipes were connected, communicating with each room of the plant. <br>  In a patronizing tone, the manufacturer invited the worker to get down to business.  Quietly and without fuss, a man in a blue jumpsuit pulled out one tool from his bag, a small rubber hammer. <br>  Carefully and methodically, he began to knock out different parts of the car, carefully listening to the sounds that made a metal surface.  For ten minutes, he tapped pressure sensors, thermostats, bearings and connections, where he assumed the damage was.  Finally, he went back to his tool bag, put a small hammer in place and chose a large hammer. <br>  He went to one of the elbows in one of the pipe sections and struck a gentle blow with a hammer.  The effect was instant.  Something moved and the steam generator stopped vibrating. <br>  The Manufacturer was delighted: <br>  - Amazing!  Amazing  Send me the bill.  Double your pricing. <br>  ‚ÄúThat is not necessary, sir,‚Äù the worker replied. <br>  When a few days later the manufacturer received a bill, he was stunned.  The amount far exceeded his expectations.  10,000 pounds sterling!  Big money at the time.  Despite the fact that he paid a lot more to those experts who tried to fix the damage, but failed, he knew that they spent several days there.  And they were representatives of companies with an excellent reputation!  And this strange man spent only ten minutes there. <br>  The manufacturer gave an order to the secretary so that she sent him a request requesting a detailed description of the cost of the services rendered. <br>  Soon the answer came from the mail. <br>  Ten minutes of tapping - 1 pound. <br>  For knowing where to hit - 9999 pounds. <br>  Total: 10,000 pounds. <br><img src="http://img166.imageshack.us/img166/7991/thumbsupju7.jpg"></div>
