  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of promotion services behavioral factors: SERPClick, Userator, Movebo</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In Russia (and, perhaps, all over the world), there are only three services for artificially ‚Äúimproving‚Äù the behavioral factors of sites in the eyes of search engines: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://userator.ru/">Username</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://movebo.ru/">Movebo</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://serpclick.ru/">Serpklik</a> </li></ul><br>  There are many comparisons of these sites on the Internet, but all analyzes are reduced to a comparison of usability and cost per action. <br>  I wanted to find out which of these services works best and gives the best result.  But then the question is how to do it?  If you add one website to all services for promotion, it is not clear who among them gave the result.  If you add different sites, you will not be able to meet equal conditions for the participants, it's like testing tires from different manufacturers on the Zhiguli and Audi, and on the basis of the test to identify the best tires. <br>  Therefore, it was decided to test services by indirect measures: <br><br><h4>  Input data: </h4><br>  1) With artificial improvement of behavioral factors for the site, should be wound and tips in the search <br>  2) By experience, prompts for new requests appear in 3-4 days <br>  3) Tips are sorted by frequency of requests recently <br><br><h4>  Testing objectives: </h4><br>  Verification of the performance and quality of services for cheating behavioral.

    <h4>  The essence of testing: </h4><br>  We add the ‚Äúword + unique word‚Äù pairs to all services that are not in the prompts and control the appearance of new prompts for the given word.  The presence of the phrase in the tips will tell us about the serviceability of the service and the perception of Yandex by its employees. <br><br><h4>  Method: </h4><br>  A word is taken that has hints, but the frequency is ‚Äú!  WordStatus ‚Äùof tips no more than 50. Each service is put on the same number of executions by wrapping the phrase‚Äú word + service name ‚Äù.  A week later, the appearance of prompts and the location of prompts are monitored. <br><br>  For example, take the word "seriousness" <br>  Current tips for this word: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f11/572/419/f11572419753425d9f4f7e2bb6fc3224.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We remove the exact frequency of each request: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e56/7de/410/e567de4108ed4f75967fdc400f79e717.png"><br><br>  We will add three phrases to the services, one phrase for each of the services: <br>  seriousness serpklika <br>  user seriousness <br>  earnestness <br><br>  In a week and a month later we will see changes in the tips.  On the availability of tips and the location of its location, it will be possible to conclude about the quality of the service. <br>  For the purity of the experiment, the keyword is not disclosed. <br><br>  Possible, to use the words: <br><ul><li>  effectiveness </li><li>  functionality </li><li>  accuracy </li><li>  rationality </li><li>  durability </li></ul><br><br><h4>  The course of the experiment: </h4><br><h5>  08/15/2014 </h5><br>  Phrases were added to all three services: <br>  promotion without references user <br>  promotion without links serpklik <br>  promotion without links <br><br>  At the time of launch, there were only two phrases in the tips: <br>  promotion without reference 2014 <br>  promotion without references as <br><br>  In the user account and in the server, 100 transitions per month were assigned, but with the mobile it wasn‚Äôt possible to simply assign the number of transitions, since  Movebo themselves assign the number of transitions and adjust this value manually is impossible, and the predicted number of transitions is not specified.  Within a week, experimentally, we determined how many domains need to be added to the movebo, so that 3-4 transitions would be made every day.  Therefore, by the time the movebo made its full effect (08/20/2014), the sickle and user had been working for almost a week. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b77/2ba/855/b772ba855d4a4f919ddfdba7d096e167.png" width="447" height="205"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/118/f92/aa5/118f92aa50764fec9f554d004225489a.png" width="522" height="225"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/149/0a5/337/1490a5337542473186c5db9d688fb145.png" width="416" height="293"><br><br><h5>  08.22.2014 </h5><br>  In the tips appeared: <br>  promotion without links serpklik <br>  promotion without references user <br><br>  while the serpklik wins, the mobo does not appear at all, but it was launched later. <br><br><h5>  08.27.2014 </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e4/30a/fcd/4e430afcd7bc438998b1833b27dd3db5.png"><br><br>  Movebo, despite the later launch, rose above the user, and the sickle even overtook the hint ‚Äúpromotion without references as‚Äù <br><br>  An interesting feature was discovered by chance - if you make a request from Montenegro, then the tips and the layout of the tips are somewhat different: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc8/3ff/504/fc83ff5042a149f38658e1ab6bd1c588.png"><br><br><h5>  09/01/2014 </h5><br>  In the tips, no changes occurred on the 27th. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7a/4a7/4c8/d7a4a74c8e3d42d39a1a95f979895a02.png"><br><br>  If you make a request from the Netherlands, we will see the same picture as the 27th in Montenegro <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a9/c74/660/6a9c74660eb54246824533d3724b1c72.png"><br><br><h5>  09/03/2014 </h5><br>  Everything remained in its place, you can complete the experiment and summarize <br><br>  Moscow: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c64/b03/ce2/c64b03ce2b824a7185305e70e4cfe9de.png"><br><br>  Europe: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ef/4ed/6c5/5ef4ed6c51dd4be2995b7bc4c67c7aaa.png"><br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  1. There are hints on all three services, which means that all three work with the issuance and Yandex perceives them. <br>  2. <a href="http://www.serpclick.ru/">Serpklik</a> showed the best results, second place for <a href="http://userator.ru/">User</a> , and <a href="http://movebo.ru/">Movebo</a> on the last. <br>  3. In Serpklik, the average coincidence of the region of the site and the region of the performer is 95%.  Apparently, some of the performers were in Europe and this caused a clue to appear there.  The user in Europe won - we can assume that he has a lower percentage of the region of the site and the artist below.  Movove did not appear at all, well done, but see paragraph 5. Perhaps, an additional experiment should be conducted on the percentage of coincidence of the region of the site and the region of the performer. <br>  4. All employees of the User are located on their website.  Serpklik employees on a third-party site (Profittask.com), and the movebo does not disclose where their employees are, even the tech support on the site did not reveal such information, which suggests that actions are performed by bots (but they still Yandex). <br><br>  UPD: 09/04/2014, 16:52 Suddenly, the clues were cleaned and clues with the word "serpclick" and "movobo" left.  In addition, almost all the tips that previously were in Yandex according to the words ‚Äúserpclick‚Äù and ‚Äúmovobo‚Äù disappeared.
