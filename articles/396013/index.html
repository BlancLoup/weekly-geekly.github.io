    <h3>  Ignored warnings </h3><br>  In the last accident at Kardwell, Montana, Model X crashed into wooden rails alongside a two-lane road. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe car was driving on an unseparated mountain road after midnight with the autopilot system turned on,‚Äù a spokeswoman for Tesla Motors told the Air Force, talking about one of the autopilot functions. <br>  "According to our data, there is an assumption that the driver did not keep his hands on the steering wheel, because no application of forces was recorded for two minutes after the autorun was turned on - even the slightest value, like one hand lying relaxed on the steering wheel, was would be fixed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/665/ba9/ecf/665ba9ecf66e4d05bce9cf19a5952ee7.jpg"><br>  <i>Tesla Model X. Image belongs to Tesla company</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is contrary to the terms of use, which you agree to when you turn on the function and a notification appears on the toolbar with each activation‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúWhen the driving conditions became very vague, the car warned the driver to put his hands on the steering wheel‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúHe did not do this, and soon after the aforementioned car crashed into a structure on the edge of the road‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúAutomatic steering ... best suited for roads with a middle splitter‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúWe especially advise not to use it at high speeds on the roads without separation‚Äù <br><br>  CNN reported that the car lost the wheel, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/12/technology/tesla-autopilot-accident/">but neither the driver nor the passenger suffered</a> . <br>  According to the man who introduced himself as Pang, to the police officer, the car issued all the warnings in English, and he spoke Mandarin (or North Chinese) dialect of Chinese. <br><br><h3>  Repeated attempts </h3><br>  This time, the company reported the details of the incident much faster than in the previous Florida case. <br>  The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday that they were investigating why the company reported an accident only on June 30 - 54 days after the accident occurred and 9 days after informing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efa/8f3/7e4/efa8f37e425c4e95b6f7a8ad0b486170.jpg"><br>  <i>Joshua Brown, who died in Tesla's accident with autopilot on.</i>  <i>AP Image</i> <br>  During this time, the company received funds from investors. <br>  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know that there was an autopilot crash while receiving the money,‚Äù <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-investigating-tesla-for-possible-securities-law-breach-1468268385">Musk said</a> , ‚Äúwe told NHTSA only that someone had died, but not about the fact that it was related to the autopilot‚Äù <br><br>  On Tuesday, <a href="http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM533397/INIM-PE16007-64338.pdf">NHTSA published a letter</a> sent to Tesla to clarify the details of the accident investigation. <br><br>  The letter asks for details of all autopilot updates since its release a year ago, as well as information about upcoming changes. <br>  The organization is also investigating whether the autopilot was included in an accident that occurred on July 1. <br><br><h3>  ProPilot Announced </h3><br>  Although Tesla says the driver must be " <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/presskit/autopilot">attentive and up to date</a> " when using the autopilot, critics say the user of the system will be " <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2016/06/30/tesla-model-crash/86570186/">inevitably</a> " recognized. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ae/cfd/aa6/9aecfdaa695b4545a20e54d651fe3f0c.jpg"><br>  <i>Nissan with ProPilot technology.</i>  <i>Image belongs to AP</i> <br>  However, other automakers follow the same strategy.  Nissan <a href="http://www.newsroom.nissan-europe.com/uk/en-gb/Media/Media.aspx%3Fmediaid%3D148015">announced</a> the ProPilot - the lane detection function, which allows the car to follow the car ahead, braking and accelerating without instructions from the person. <br>  The technology will be launched for the first time in the Japanese market, when a minivan with this technology will be available next month.  For the European market, the presentation is scheduled for next year.  As a safety lock, the system includes switching it off if the hands were removed from the steering wheel for a certain period. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a4/694/704/1a46947044df457785e12818ac9322c6.jpg"><br>  <i>Land Rover Image</i> <br>  Land Rover is testing technology that can determine off-road.  In another development, Jaguar Land Rover announces plans to test <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D82-p9W7OFhc">more than 100 autonomous research vehicles</a> on roads near Coventry, England, until 2020. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396013/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396013/</a></p>
