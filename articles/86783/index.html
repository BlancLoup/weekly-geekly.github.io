      What did it end up with?  How often do you hear such a phrase: ‚ÄúWell, I'm an owl (or‚Äú lark ‚Äù), it's easier for me, why should I change something in my life?  I obviously will not be comfortable, because I am a night owl! ‚Äù? <br>  Such beliefs (caused by self-deception, self-confidence in relation to a certain group, a certain type of people) in some cases do not allow people to self-improve and get rid of the negative impact of an object or person in their working life. <br><br>  <b>In this article, I will focus primarily on the organization of working time.</b> <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> ‚ÄúI am a‚Äú lark ‚Äù, but I have to work at night ‚Äî I feel so bad, but I can‚Äôt change anything!‚Äù <br>  <b>Answer:</b> change your job to your day job or stop considering yourself a ‚Äúmorning person‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> ‚ÄúI am an owl and I know perfectly well that the first peak of intellectual activity (day) is observed from 13:00 to 14:00, the second (evening) - from 18:00 to 20:00 hours and the third (night ) - from 23:00 to 01:00. ‚ÄùTherefore, I should not work actively in the morning - I will actively communicate on ICQ, go to smoke, visit other offices and the canteen and play in a headscarf ... Everything is in accordance with my type!  I live right.  And at night, I proceed to the hack, I can sometimes take office work at home ... " <br>  <b>Answer:</b> this is a typical excuse, a person covers himself with the type to which he refers himself. <br><br><h4>  Theory </h4><br><br>  <b>British scientists</b> (they are also learned men of Great Britain, and not just mythical memes) proved, and people picked up that there are such individual human properties that influence both his activity and well-being.  Some stand up "not a dawn light" and immediately get down to business.  Others suffer and suffer if they wake up early for work and happily linger until the night. <br><br>  The most common and generally accepted is the classification of the division of people into: evening type - ‚Äúowls‚Äù and morning - ‚Äúlarks‚Äù.  Some scientists also distinguish a special type of day - ‚Äúpigeons‚Äù or arrhythms that are not particularly tied to rhythms (I think it is easy for such people to change, so I don‚Äôt write further about them). <br><br>  <b>The characteristics of internal rhythms</b> arise from the need to synchronize them with external changes (i.e., day and night) with the help of light.  Sunlight is a time marker for our biological clock at the time of the morning awakening.  But the external environment has an active influence on the biological rhythm.  <b>In proof of give a scientific fact.</b> <br>  If, in the experiment, we isolate a person from external stimuli and artificially shift his time 1 hour ahead daily, then after 2 weeks he will be able to stay awake at night and sleep during the day.  Thus, the possibility of organizing the influence of external factors is demonstrated in such a way as to shift the time of sleep and wakefulness to the ‚Äúright‚Äù time.  Many "owls" in childhood were very disobedient and their affairs, which the parents looked askance at, they had to do at night.  Such a person, growing up sure that he had better work at night.  On the contrary, many ‚Äúlarks‚Äù in childhood were very obedient children (they could be such because they were afraid of their parents, or from childhood were goal-oriented individuals and tried to discipline themselves) - such people, when they grow up, work very well since the very morning, and in the evening they get tired because already redid a lot of cases and want to sleep because they are tired. <br><br>  As you already understood from the above, <b>each person</b> once (usually in childhood) <b>fixed his working rhythm</b> under the influence of a persistently repeated external factor, <b>so it is possible to change the so-called type</b> , if necessary, for example for work. <br><br><h4>  A little about students and food </h4><br><br>  The "owls" and the "larks" were different and lunch time, and dinner time.  ‚ÄúOwls‚Äù always eat later (especially dinner) and they can be easily understood if we remember that they usually have a quick lunch and their breakfast is not like breakfast.  The time from the first meal to the last is, on average, 1-2 hours longer than that of the ‚Äúlarks‚Äù.  The same result was obtained by the Swedish biorhythmologist Ostberg (whose questionnaires are considered the most professional).  That is what allowed him to say that the period of his own rhythms, characteristic of the organism, is longer for owls than for larks. <br><br>  <b>Conclusions: the</b> rhythm of the need for food determines our body and "the most accurate clock is the stomach."  But the organization of the diet depends on the specific life situation.  So, workers and employees usually get up early than students, so some have breakfast before and others later.  Additional factors also play a role, for example, the time that a person spends on the way to work or to college.  Those students who have half an hour enough for this will have breakfast after 8. Those who need half an hour to an hour, usually have breakfast between 7 and 8 in the morning.  Unfortunately, the dining room has the most significant effect on lunchtime, is it more conveniently located, is it possible to eat quickly and what is the range of food in it? <br><br>  <b>In order to achieve high productivity and preserve health, one</b> must take into account, first of all, the feeling of true hunger, and not the time to start work, a time pleasant for lunch in your organization and the time you return home.  It is difficult to do and is not necessary if you do not suffer from chronic fatigue or irritability or headaches or all of this together, because  these are clear signs of sudden drops in blood glucose levels.  <i>Those.</i>  <i>you ate at 8 and wanted to eat around 12, but lunch only at 13 and during this hour your productivity drops sharply, you feel tired.</i>  <i>Here the long-awaited dinner has arrived and you eagerly throw yourself on food, chew less carefully, the food lays down and gives you even more fatigue + you are drawn to the sweet, so that at least to somehow recharge, you eat this sweet and the blood sugar level changes with low to high, and such a drop does not contribute not only to efficiency, but also to general health.</i>  Many doctors are against snacking.  Only there is one thing: if you take more than 4 hours between food breaks and you are a reasonable person and do not eat more than 500 grams at a time.  food, then the most ill-fated glucose fluctuates (there are very many scientific articles devoted to this, if you are interested, you can read about the whole range of side effects of such drops), so you need to do light snacks in the form of yoghurt (without sugar), fruits, natural muesli, nuts (not more than 20 grams). <br><br><h4>  Some practice </h4><br><br><ul><li>  <b>Set priorities</b> , if in the first place - work, then dance from it: what time is needed for intensive work - for this time and adjust your internal clock, i.e.  Determine when it is best to get up, take breaks, snacks, so that this time will be as productive as possible for you. </li><li>  <b>Listen to the first signals of the stomach</b> - then the body will not work with overload, and the food is better absorbed. </li><li>  <b>A healthy breakfast</b> (not fried bacon and eggs) is necessary not only for ‚Äúlarks‚Äù, but also for ‚Äúowls‚Äù - they will help them not only to wake up, but also to avoid diseases of the stomach and intestines. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86783/</a></p>
