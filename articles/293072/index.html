  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electronic document management with tax inspection for individual entrepreneurs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am an individual entrepreneur.  My small company develops and manufactures electronics.  There is no possibility to keep a full-time accountant, so I decide the relevant issues on my own. <br><br>  However, the solution of one question was delayed for six months. <br><br>  The fact is that during the registration of IP, I chose several economic activity codes (OKVED), among which were electrical equipment manufacturing, software development, and some from related industries.  And there was also code 52.6.2 ‚ÄúRetail trade, carried out through TV shops and computer networks (electronic commerce, including the Internet)‚Äù, because I have my own website and an online store is implemented there.  When I registered, I did not know that among these codes there is the so-called main one, which, by some coincidence, was exactly 52.6.2. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Honestly, I have never attached any importance to this, until I decided to take part in the competition for state subsidies.  When I came to the department for entrepreneurship and small business in our city and told about the profile of their activities, I was immediately told that the probability of receiving subsidies is quite high, because first of all they are given to production workers.  However, they were very surprised by the fact that in my extract from EGRIP, which I brought, the main activity is trade.  I was told that we need to urgently change the type of activity, because a formal check is taking place in the competition and otherwise I will simply cure it.

      I arrived at the office, got into the Internet and began to figure out how to change these codes.  It turned out that everything is very simple and you need to fill in a simple form (24001) of just four pages. <br><br>  I have a subscription to the SBiS ++ electronic document management system, I quickly found the necessary form there, filled it out and clicked the ‚ÄúSend‚Äù button and then ... <br><br>  The program wrote to me that this form cannot be sent electronically and you have to go to the tax office yourself.  Okay, I decided, take a walk. <br><br>  I came to my tax and here is another gift - they do not accept such forms !!!  And we must go to another tax, which for such things serves the entire city. <br><br>  Well, I arrived there, honestly served two hours, and maybe more, and passed this form. <br><br>  Ten days later I received a notification in the mail that I was denied registration because the form was filled out incorrectly!  And what could be wrong there, if there are only my full names.  and digital codes ?!  So the codes themselves were incorrect. <br><br>  It turns out that when I registered in 2011, some OKVED codes were three-digit, for example, 72.2 ‚ÄúSoftware development and consulting in this area‚Äù.  And then this classifier was altered and the codes began to have at least four digits, that is, you must specify 72.20 (with a zero at the end !!!). <br><br>  Of course, I got angry, but I had nothing to do, I corrected the form and went back to the tax office.  Having sat there for three hours, I did not have time to pass it, because there were a lot of people.  The next day I was waiting for another disappointment.  I ordered a no-debt tax statement, and there I had a debt of 6 kopecks.  In general, I did not have time for the competition and as a result, scored on him. <br><br>  Half a year has passed and even a little more, and now one day I receive another small portion of letters according to the SBiS ++ system, among which there is one in which something is said about the personal account on the site in the tax office for the PI. <br><br>  I have been using my account as an individual for a long time, and I must say it‚Äôs pretty comfortable done there.  For the sake of interest, I registered in the office for the PI.  I go to the main page and see the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù section, where the first item is ‚ÄúMaking changes to the EGRIP‚Äù.  Wow, I thought, and clicked there with the mouse. <br><br>  A new page has opened with step-by-step instructions from three points: <br><ul><li>  Preparation of the application (it is proposed to use their free program) </li><li>  Sending application through the site </li><li>  waiting for an answer </li></ul><br><br>  It seems everything is just ... <br><br>  I downloaded the program, filled in the form I needed and clicked the ‚ÄúPackage Formation‚Äù button.  And then an interesting window opens: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a97/bf0/5fb/a97bf05fb57b431c9e3910f966b412bb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In it, you must select the desired tax (this is understandable), and also indicate the file of the statement itself.  It seemed strange to me, because, as a rule, all documents are transmitted in XML format, and the program has already generated them.  And here you need another file in one of the three formats (* .doc, * .docx, * .xls, * .xlsx, * .tiff). <br><br>  As I wrote above, the program allows you to generate only an XML file.  Well, I press the "Print ..." button and output the document to a virtual PDF printer.  Next, convert the PDF file to TIFF <a href="http://image.online-convert.com/ru/convert-to-tiff">online service</a> . <br><br>  I indicate the received TIFF in the program and immediately receive another message about the need to sign it with an electronic digital signature (EDS). <br><br>  I have two EDS keys, one from the SBiS ++, the second from the Internet bank.  The program without any problems agreed to sign the file with any of them.  If I understand correctly, then this program requires CryptoPRO.  On another computer, where CryptoPRO was not, the program displayed an error. <br><br>  So, I used the key for SBiS ++, after which the program generated a package for me in the form of a ZIP archive, and I successfully sent it through the tax website. <br><br>  A couple of hours later I received a confirmation email that I received a statement signed by such and such a signature. <br>  Well, I think fine.  There is no need to go anywhere, in a week the documents will be ready.  But it was not there!  A week later I received a letter that I was denied registration !!!  Why?  Again wrong codes?  No, the codes are correct! <br><br>  It turns out that on the last page there are no my full names.  and signatures !!!  Here is such nonsense!  I sign an EDS document, and they tell me that I need a handwritten signature! <br><br>  I give the full answer below: <br><br><blockquote>  Among the documents submitted for state registration are absent: <br>  PACKAGE OF DOCUMENTS DOES NOT COMPLY WITH REQUIREMENTS, INSTALLED <br>  Article 22.2 of the Federal Law No. 129-, ..  APPLICATION FORM P24001 IS DRAWNED INADMISSIBLE. <br>  NOT A FULL MEMBER OF STATE  IN THE CASE OF THE REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICATION TO THE RECEIVING BODY, THE PHYSICAL PERSON RECOGNIZED AS AN INDIVIDUAL ENTREPRENEUR, THE INDIVIDUAL PHYSICAL PERSON (APPLICANT) IN THE RESPONSIBLE STRATEGY THE STATUS <br>  THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO PP.  And P. 1 CT.  23 of the FEDERAL LAW ‚Ññ129- of 08.08.2001.  PROVISION OF STATE REGISTRATION IS PROVIDED </blockquote><br><br>  I thought a little and acted as follows. <br><br>  First of all, I wrote a letter to the tax office asking me to explain the reason for the refusal and the meaning of a handwritten signature, which cannot be in an electronic document.  And the need for it is absurd, because there is a digital signature.  I send similar documents through SBiS ++ and there are no problems.  Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt received an answer to this appeal yet, although 12 calendar days have already passed. <br><br>  Secondly, I sent the documents a second time, but at the same time, I first printed out the form on the printer, wrote with my own hand the full name.  and signed.  After that, I scanned, formed a multi-page TIFF and sent it back to tax. <br><br>  And what do you think?  A week later, I received a notification that the changes were made, along with the electronic versions of the documents.  It is also written that the originals were sent to me by regular mail! <br><br>  That's it! <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> <br>  I received an answer to my request from the tax.  He clarified several points at once: <br><br>  1. Interdistrict Inspectorate of the Federal Tax Service of Russia No. 2 for the Ryazan Region performs the functions of the Single Registration Center.  Therefore, for changes in the EGRIP, regardless of the place of registration, you must contact this tax office. <br><br>  2. According to clause 9 of the requirements for the execution of electronic documents sent to the registering authority, approved by order No. YAK-7-6 / 489 of August 12, 2011 ‚ÄúOn approval of the Procedure for sending to the registering authority during the state registration of legal entities, peasant (farmer ) households and individuals as individual entrepreneurs of electronic documents using public information and telecommunication networks, including the Internet, including a single portal of state and municipal services ‚Äù,  electronic documents are sent to the registering authority in the form of files <b>with images of documents scanned from paper media</b> , executed in accordance with the requirements of the legislation of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  I looked at this order, there really is all this and, moreover, even the scan parameters are given: <br><blockquote>  Documents containing multiple sheets are scanned into one file. <br>  10. Scanning of document images is carried out taking into account the following requirements: <br><ol><li>  image format: BW </li><li>  Resolution: 300 * 300 dpi </li><li>  color depth: 1 bit </li><li>  format of the finished file: multipage TIF </li></ol><br></blockquote><br>  Now at least almost everything became clear.  Only one thing is unclear why it was impossible to immediately indicate this order on the tax website.  And why in the refusal, which I received from the tax after the first attempt, there was not a word about this order either. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293072/</a></p>
