  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Twisted pair rug</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yes, the name of the person who invented a permanent fetish and an endless source of joy for almost all admins is famous for centuries - the color differentiation of the lived twisted pair. <br>  This Friday evening I want to show you another handicraft from the category of wooden flash drives. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/acd/b9e/eba/acdb9eebaaf49a4f3787133811037d60.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with the fact that 5 twisted-pair meters were lying around at home, and the new work did not have a cup stand (from a wet mug, you know, such awful stains remain on the table).  Without further ado, I set about gutting the cable. <br>  Frankly, I never knitted before in my life, I have no idea how a scarf or a mitten is obtained from a large round skein of threads.  Actually had to learn in the field. <br>  For everything about everything, it took me five nights of leisurely knitting in front of a laptop display and under the mocking gaze of my wife. <br>  Next, I will describe the technical process, subtleties and errors.  Those who are not interested, can not continue to read.  And the fingers will tell you a huge thank you, if you do not repeat my experience. <br><h5>  Tech. Process </h5><br>  So let's get started.  First, gut the meter and a half vitukha.  You don‚Äôt need to cut anything off - it‚Äôs not known how much is useful.  No need to unravel all the pairs now.  Just take an orange pair and unravel the first 50 centimeters. We start, of course, with white and orange. <br>  The main problem for me was that, at first glance, we don‚Äôt have too many loose ends.  But it is not.  We make such a node, as shown in the photo and leave a loop - it will not work anyway. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a83/2aa/7a1/a832aa7a1ed554c53e1e3896acd0b773.jpg"><br><br>  To prevent the resulting loop from opening, fold the cable in half and push it into this loop, which can now be tightened. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c43/4b1/bfc/c434b1bfccb3f6cb74bd27d95dc01fbc.jpg"><br><br>  The inserted end is also tightened, leaving a small loop. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/83b/fc7/781/83bfc77814e9c54bb90a6b27656fc002.jpg">

Continue the same, then fold?  Does not roll - there will be no coupling of two rows.  Do the second independent from the first row and then fasten with pieces of cable?  Pornography.  But two minutes of thought help solve this problem.  The mechanism is illustrated in the photo.  On the first row already received, we loosen the last knot and make a loop into which we push the folded cable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f4f/6a1/42e/f4f6a142e01986f2f8034a11c04f14df.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b45/2d5/187/b452d518771ae9df3acae126a1529b32.jpg"><br><br>  We are on the right track, but bad luck: there is already a loop into which a folded cable can be inserted to create a new loop, into which we will extend a folded cable to create a loop, into which ... But how will this be connected with the first row?  The answer to the surface - we relax now the penultimate node from the first row and fold the cable twice in two loops. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a2/62e/66a/6a262e66acee532faf3fb9070a6479bb.jpg"><br><br>  First, the rows are connected and we have a new cycle.  We repeat it to the end and by the same principle go in the opposite direction.  It is better to tighten each loop to a certain extent, otherwise they will stick out.  And it is better to tighten everywhere the same way, otherwise it will be weak somewhere, but somewhere it will be strong because of what the rug will lead and it will not be even, but slightly convex, as I did. <br>  Now the first trick, which I did not pay enough attention to, and the rug at my end greatly narrowed.  Reaching the very last node of the third row, do not rush to go in the opposite direction.  You see a tightly tightened eyelet sticking out from the previous row, you need to relax it and push the cable into it, otherwise each next row will be shorter than the previous one. <br>  By eye we estimate how many rows you need to go through in order to get a square and work - monotonous work, which at some moments starts to run out, especially when the fingers are already burning from friction and pressure. <br>  &lt;Spoiler&gt; to loosen tightly knotted knots, you can use mother's knitting needles or paste from a pen. &lt;/ Spoiler&gt; <br>  Note that the second end of the core should be on the opposite side if you want to make a patchcord like me.  Starting a row of a different color, you must leave sufficient margin. <br>  If you want to compress it, as I did, note that you must have an odd number of rows in order for the tails of the veins to be on all sides. <br>  So, after a few hours of work, you get such a spider-like something: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d70/cf3/54c/d70cf354c30ccc3c68cd6d8639c1263d.jpg"><br>  These horrible tails can, for sure, be neatly tidied up or woven into the main carpet, but I must admit that it was already lazy, and the length of the remains would not allow it, so the output is: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b26/425/21e/b2642521ef3c926839ed014805412e9a.jpg"><br><br>  Now, even if all the patch cords disappear all over the Earth at once, you will get this mat out of the table and save the world. <br>  And from the scraps you can still do something for the soul (a bunch for a girl). <br><br><h5>  Field mat </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/83a/f3c/3f8/83af3c3f83cbd74f0edbd5ebe62a1997.jpg"><br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Video of some moments (I apologize for not having sound): <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/cltQTlPu2zE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh6VJOo0J3kaXPBSIpokgsyJ3Ur1g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Good luck! <br>  PS Here the habrovchanin hollow had the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/humour/91220/">idea</a> to tie a belt.
