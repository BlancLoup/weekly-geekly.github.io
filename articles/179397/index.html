Unfortunately, they are not so successful, they require much more work and preparation, so I will not consider them.  Let me just say that they are not needed.  Palace of Memory (Cicero Road) is the best way to memorize lists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/550/79f/120/55079f120c42bb5076f4fd44ce29ce28.jpg"><br><br>  But what about the numbers?  If you tried to memorize a set of numbers using a memory palace, you would encounter some problems, for example: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"

        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  The figures are dry, insensible.  It is difficult to attach an association to them. </li><li>  The numbers are repeated.  Therefore, memories will overlap. </li><li>  Most often you need to remember a lot of numbers (several phone numbers), which complicates the process. </li></ul><br><br>  Under the cut, I will introduce you to two ways to remember these soulless numbers.  It is by numbers that annual mnemonic competitions are held, where thousands of numbers are memorized for a limited time! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of all the methods that I studied, I found only two that were really worthwhile.  Unfortunately, each of them requires preparation, but after that you can memorize phone numbers, house numbers, friends' passwords, and any sequence of numbers. <br><br><h4>  Alphanumeric alphabet </h4><br><h5>  Description </h5><br>  The first way is to change the type of memorized information.  Instead of numbers, memorize words.  But how to translate numbers into letters?  To do this, we need an alphabet, which we only need to memorize once, and then we need to associate numbers with letters using it. <br><br>  It is very important to use only vowels or consonants in the alphabet.  So as not to be confused, which letters were added to make up the word, and which are equivalent to numbers.  It is best for everyone to come up with their own alphabet, something that first comes to mind at the mention of a number, but I will still write my own alphabet, which I use to memorize numbers: <br><br><ul><li>  Zero - the letters H or L. If you use vowels, you can the letter O. </li><li>  One - F (first, as it happens) and the letter P (Once) </li><li>  Two - letter D </li><li>  Three - letter T, P </li><li>  Four - the letter H or K </li><li>  Five - letter P </li><li>  Six - letter ,  </li><li>  Seven - the letter C </li><li>  Eight - the letter B </li><li>  Nine - the letter B (most), you can M (many) </li></ul><br><br>  The more letters you have attached to each digit, the easier it will be to make words, but it‚Äôs harder to remember what is attached to it. <br><br><h5>  How to remember? </h5><br>  Now, to memorize any sequence of numbers, you only need to translate the numbers into letters and make up words.  For example, take the identifiers of my previous topics: <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178831/">178831</a> - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178831/">Blonde</a> Vova cake! <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179319/">179319</a> - Dew washes Roma! <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179373/">179373</a> - Bati <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179373/">rasa</a> : ‚ÄúSota‚Äù. <br><br>  It remains to come up with a fairly simple associative link, as was written in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179373/">previous article</a> .  For example: <br><br>  Blonde Vova cake!  - Putin with a square head (sorry, such a fantasy) <br><br><h5>  disadvantages </h5><br>  I don‚Äôt like this way by the abundance of links that need to be made to remember a small set of numbers.  To memorize 6 digits, I need to make a phrase, bind it to the value of six digits.  And when you need to remember, you need to go through these steps. <br><br>  The main disadvantage is that the phrase is difficult to remember, not everyone has enough vocabulary to immediately make constructive sentences. <br><br><h4>  Link table </h4><br><h5>  Description </h5><br>  This method requires quite a lot of preparation.  But this way, in my opinion, is much better than the way with the alphabet.  The bottom line is the opposite method about which I told at the end of the last article (1 - Aladdin, 6 - Hex). <br><br>  The essence of the method is to create associations from 1 to 100, and then use the inverse relationship.  Instead of remembering Aladdin one by one, remember A unit by Aladdin. <br><br>  A number of associations (Aladdin, the ball, etc.) memorize dear Cicero!  An elegant solution that is the best in my opinion. <br><br><h5>  How to remember? </h5><br>  For example, we have a series from the previous article: <br><br><ul><li>  One - Aladdin </li><li>  Two - Lithuania </li><li>  Three - rub (lamp) </li><li>  Four - holes in cheese </li><li>  Five - honey agaric </li><li>  Six - Six.  (similar to writing) </li><li>  Seven - James Bond (007) </li><li>  Eight - Snowman (8 looks like a snowman) </li><li>  Nine - Swan </li><li>  Zero - Gingerbread Man </li></ul><br><br>  Now, in order to memorize <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178831">178831, it is</a> enough to come up with a road with associations associated with numbers.  And then, bumping into each association, just remember the number.  How to invent a road - read in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179373/">previous</a> article. <br><br>  I learned about this method from the book of Dominic O'Brien ‚ÄúHow to develop a perfect memory‚Äù.  In it, the author makes preparation more, and memorization is easier.  The author made associations for all numbers from 00 to 99, and he wrote down only people or characters.  By the way, he wrote down the characters in alphanumeric alphabet.  For example: <br><br><ul><li>  04 = NK = Nicolas Cage </li><li>  24 = DK = Jim Carrey </li></ul><br>  and similarly the whole hundred. <br><br>  In addition to this, for each character, he invented a unique action (it was never repeated by anyone), for example: he makes faces, plays baseball.  Thus, in order to memorize 4 digits, he needed to come up with only one association with the action! <br>  For example, 0424 is Nicolas Cage, who makes a face (action Jim Carrey). <br><br>  But, of course, to achieve such results, long preparation is necessary, and I do not think that this is necessary for an ordinary person. <br><br><h5>  Interesting fact </h5><br>  Simon Reinhard from Germany in 2011 broke the world record, remembered a randomly mixed deck of cards in 21 seconds! <br>  <a href="http://eidosmemory.com/mirovoj-rekord-po-zapominaniyu-kolody-kart.html">eidosmemory.com/mirovoj-rekord-po-zapominaniyu-kolody-kart.html</a> <br><br>  If you find errors in the text - write to private messages, I will promptly correct it.
