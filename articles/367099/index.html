This <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/self-driving-vehicle-prototypes-on-road.html">announcement was made at Google on Friday</a> .  It will be a two-seater with a removable wheel, with gas and brake pedals, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/15/new-google-self-driving-car-compact">one driver</a> will control the actions of the car all the time.  The previous ‚Äúalpha‚Äù version required the participation of two operators simultaneously. <br><br>  The machine, reminiscent of the illegitimate child Smart and Nissan Micra, is completely electric.  Its speed is artificially limited to 40 kilometers per hour.  RoboMobil will use the results obtained from the operation of several Lexus cars, which have long been rallying on the ADR in the framework of the Google research project.  Lexus cars were equipped with autonomous driving systems, and in the process of working out the algorithms they <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/12/google-acknowledges-its-self-driving-cars-had-11-minor-accidents">got into 11 accidents</a> - but, as the company emphasizes, all the incidents did not happen through their fault.

In the United States, four states have already allowed, with certain reservations, the use of unmobiles on public roads - Michigan, Florida, California and Nevada.  But for the normal operation of the robot requires a good marking, and distinguishable road signs, and working traffic lights.  Google has already appealed to the Nevada State Department of Transportation with a request to update the markup and make it more visible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/125/6b5/3aa/1256b53aaef02e4eee4a33713db9f7d9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This, of course, does not hurt anyone, and will help even ordinary drivers.  However, in the US as a whole, there is a shortage of funds even for such high-priority things as bridge repair.  In a <a href="http://www.artba.org/2015/04/01/no-april-fools-day-joke-over-61000-u-s-bridges-need-structural-repair-new-analysis-of-u-s-department-of-transportation-data-finds/">report for 2014, the</a> transportation department calculated that it was necessary to repair more than 61,000 bridges throughout the country.  And the further, the problem becomes more serious.  250 bridges, from those that need repair, work on federal highways.  What is there to remember about the markup and road reflectors. <br><br>  Persistently overcoming all obstacles, Google is moving towards an era of fully autonomous machines.  The company does not trade off compromises, and while the major automakers are gradually building new auxiliary systems (from automatic parking to automatic braking) into their cars, Google is striving to create a completely autonomous car from the start.  One in which you can sit down, set the coordinates of the target and relax. <br><br>  Nothing is impossible, and with Google resources you can not only achieve your goal, but also do it quickly.  The company claims that we will see a fully finished product by 2020.  Wait is not long. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367099/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367099/</a></p>
