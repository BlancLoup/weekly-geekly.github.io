Black Friday became popular in Russian-speaking countries only 10 years ago, but many already simply cannot imagine their shopping without it. <br><br>  Today we will talk about Black Friday and English idioms associated with shopping.  Record and use.  But first, some interesting things. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Black Friday: what is it </h2><br>  Black Friday is called the first Friday after Thanksgiving, which falls between November 23 and 29.

      Of course, Thanksgiving is an exclusively American holiday, which reflects some of their historical events, but many other countries picked up the Black Friday celebration. <br><br>  There are several versions of the origin of the name "Black Friday".  Some of them are associated with the negative - the ‚Äúblack‚Äù, while others - quite the opposite.  We will consider two main versions. <br><br>  <b>The first version</b> says that ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù is connected with the economic collapse of the gold market in 1869.  The US authorities decided to fight the monopoly of the business of gold and in fact brought down the market, throwing out a large amount of gold on it.  The price of the precious metal in one day decreased several times, so the day was called ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>In the second version,</b> everything is a little more interesting.  It is unknown who first came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking big discounts on goods after Thanksgiving, but retailers quickly realized that this is a great way to make a profit and clear the warehouses from stale goods. <br><br>  But why "black"?  It's all about the features of the accounting of the time.  About 150 years ago, profits in the internal documents of companies were marked in black, and expenses - in red.  After such sales, the owners saw that there was more revenue than expenses.  Moreover, in one day the company could receive a monthly profit.  Due to this, the idiom <i>‚Äúto be in black‚Äù appeared</i> , which means <i>‚Äúto get profit or profit‚Äù</i> .  And Friday turned into a ‚Äúblack one‚Äù because it brought in big profits. <br><br>  It is also quite possible that both versions influenced the appearance of that Black Friday, which we know and love today.  And the appearance of an interesting idiom.  On the topic of shopping such idioms enough, so now we will analyze with you the most common and, of course, talk about their values. <br><br><h2>  English idioms about shopping </h2><br>  Americans love to buy things, but the British are just a bit behind them.  That is why in the English language there are a lot of interesting phrases that describe the shopping process. <br><br>  <b>To buy something for a song</b> <br>  (literally: buy something for a song) <br><br>  And no, Americans are not considered to be strong music connoisseurs who are ready to sell products for songs.  But to get something for free or cheap is always welcome. <br><br><blockquote>  To buy something for a song - buy something cheap </blockquote><br>  <i>Example:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>You wouldn't believe!</i>  <i>I've bought a new laptop just for a song!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You will not believe!</i>  <i>I bought a new laptop just for nothing!</i> <br><br>  <b>White sale</b> <br>  (literally: white sale) <br><br>  ‚ÄúAre you a racist, my friend?  What is it, sales only for whites? ‚ÄùThose who are not familiar with this idiom may well have a similar impression.  But in fact, everything is much easier.  After all, the phrase displays only ish sale of linen.  The linen was only white before, do you guess? <br><br><blockquote>  White sale - sale of bed linen </blockquote><br>  <i>Example:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>There were so many cute pillowcases at the yesterday's white sale.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>There were so many cute pillowcases at yesterday‚Äôs sale of bed linen.</i> <br><br>  By the way, for the USA such sales are quite common, and they are held almost every month.  But for some reason they did not take root in the post-Soviet space. <br><br>  <b>A hard sell</b> <br>  (literally: heavy sale) <br><br>  There is a separate category of consultants that runs after you on the heels of the store, writing out the delights of individual goods and literally giving them a hand, hinting that now you have to go to the cashier and pay.  Such consultants enrage everyone, and a separate phraseologism was invented for the designation of the work. <br><br>  When a consultant rigidly imposes the purchase of goods, even those that you do not need - this is a hard sale.  And for such ‚Äúemployees of the month‚Äù a separate cauldron in hell was prepared. <br><br><blockquote>  Hard sell - buy sell </blockquote><br>  <i>Example:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I don't like this shop because of their hard sells.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I do not like this store because they are selling goods.</i> <br><br>  <b>Under the hammer</b> <br>  (literally: under the hammer) <br><br>  Here everything is a little more interesting than it seems at first glance.  No one is going to destroy the goods, if no one suddenly buys them.  And even the opposite - many buyers claim them at once.  After all, we are talking about goods that are sold at auctions - during the auction the lot is, as it were, ‚Äúunder the hammer‚Äù, with the help of which the sale is conducted. <br><br><blockquote>  Under the hammer - by auction or by auction </blockquote><br>  <i>Example:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>For painting 100,000 dollars.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The painting was sold at auction for $ 100,000.</i> <br><br>  <b>Sell ‚Äã‚Äãsomeone a bill of goods</b> <br>  (literally: sell sales receipt) <br><br>  Many people believe that this idiom means "good to skimp."  But its real meaning is just the opposite.  After all, when you "sell a commodity check," it just means that you have been deceived. <br><br><blockquote>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãsomeone a bill of goods - fool someone </blockquote><br>  <i>Example:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Just imagine, he sold me a bill of goods!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Imagine, he deceived me!</i> <br><br>  <b>Not buy something</b> <br>  (Literally: do not buy anything) <br><br>  If we add the particle ‚Äúto‚Äù to the phrase, it will be translated literally.  And without it, the meaning changes drastically.  And it means ‚Äúnot to buy into something‚Äù.  Including the "super beneficial offer" and a 70% discount on goods that are not needed at all. <br><br>  <i>Example:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The shop assistant I had to buy it.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The consultant suggested that I get additional insurance, but I didn‚Äôt buy it.</i> <br><br><blockquote>  Not buy something - do not buy into something. </blockquote><br>  <b>Sell ‚Äã‚Äãlike hotcakes</b> <br>  (literally: sell like hot pancakes) <br><br>  Despite the literal translation, the meaning of the phrase is very easy to understand - the product scatters like hot cakes.  True, why in the English version they turned into "pancakes" is not clear. <br><br><blockquote>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãlike hotcakes - sold like hot cakes </blockquote><br>  <i>Example:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Wow!</i>  <i>This ties sell like hotcakes.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Wow!</i>  <i>These ties scatter like hot cakes.</i> <br><br>  Shopping is an important part of British and American culture.  Many interesting moments are connected with it - both historical and linguistic.  And sometimes they just confuse. <br><br>  But if you understand a little, then everything falls into place.  The main thing is to remember the strangest idioms.  Fortunately, there are very few, right?
