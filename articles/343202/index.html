He published the book ‚Äú <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/lmuse/designed-for-use">Designed for Use</a> ‚Äù, which is recommended by many experts in the field of UI-design.  In his blog, Lucas publishes posts that are distinguished by an abundance of facts and additional links on the topic.  He also does interviews with other developers. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://interuserface.net/">Interuserface</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Clayton Miller writes in his blog about user interface design, graphics and electronic music.  In the fall of 2009, Clayton launched Project <a href="http://10gui.com/">10 / GUI</a> .  The author himself describes it as an attempt to rethink the principles of interaction between a person and a computer using the desktop.  In the same year, the author published a <a href="http://10gui.com/video/">video</a> about the concept of the project, which was highly appreciated by many online publications.  As for the blogger's musical talent, his compositions can be found <a href="http://presteign.com/">here</a> . <br><br><hr><br><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://theerlangelist.com/">The erlangelist</a></b> </li></ul><br>  This blog will appeal to those who develop web applications on Elixir, Erlang, Ruby, JavaScript, C # and C ++.

This is not surprising: Dan worked on accelerator hardware for deep learning at Google, developed search engines at Microsoft, and did <a href="https://danluu.com/learning-to-program/">much</a> more.  He started his blog to write interesting ideas, but then switched to the analysis of complex technical issues and programming tasks. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://neverworkintheory.org/">It will never work in the story</a></b> </li></ul><br>  You can not learn to program without practice.  On the other hand, without knowing the theoretical foundations, it is also impossible to solve problems effectively.  The goal of this blog is to become a kind of bridge between theorists and practitioners.  The author hopes to provide the readers with a real picture of what is happening in the IT industry.  The site has an extensive collection of materials from various IT categories.  In addition, anyone can contribute to the development of a resource in the form of an article or review (with a Creative Commons license or its equivalent). <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://www.snellman.net/blog/">Juho Snellman's Weblog</a></b> </li></ul><br>  In the early posts of the author, you can find information about compilers and exploits, in later posts about computer networks and network programming.  Also in the blog a lot of information about Perl, Lisp and games.  All materials are structured and come out regularly. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/">Psychosomatic, Lobotomy, saw</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The author Nitsan Vakart (Nitsan Wakart) ‚Äúwith a twinkle‚Äù writes about FlameGraph, Javascript, etc. Among the features of the blog are the boring presentation of material (funny pictures, the author‚Äôs style, even verses), as well as good visualization in the form of graphs and diagrams. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/">Random ASCII</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Programmer Bruce Dawson (Bruce Dawson) is working with Google on Chrome for Windows.

Nevertheless, getting lost in the blog will not work, because the author has taken care of decent navigation for readers. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://blog.plover.com/">The Universe of Discourse</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Blog author is Mark Dominus.  He wrote the book <a href="https://hop.perl.plover.com/book/">Higher-Order Perl: Transforming Programs with Programs</a> .  In addition, he prepared materials for Perl.com, PerlMonth and The Perl Journal.  It seems that Mark does not write about anything other than Perl, but this is not quite the case.

The author promotes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãclean code, fights for a professional approach to programming and honors it as a craft and art.  Therefore, most of the posts are philosophical reflections on a particular topic.  However, the author does not forget about purely technical issues. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://www.onebigfluke.com/">One big fluke</a></b> </li></ul><br>  This blog will be a good help for those who are just starting their way of development.
