But often buying a mouse and regretfully realizing that it does not fit, we are forced to go to the store to change or buy another. <br>  One ingenious person, with the nickname Walkie, decided to independently develop and make a mouse that would meet his wishes and requirements ... And he did.  And he called it W-Mouse. <br>  Walkie made the mouse not only to itself, but also taught to make w-mice, other good people. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  W-Mouse has the following distinctive features or rather features: <br>  - Fine-tuning of the sensor on a specific surface (mat).  This is possible by changing parameters such as the laser current of the backlight, the exposure time of the sensor (it also photographs the surface), the separation height. <br>  - Set the motion characteristics of the cursor.  W-Mouse allows you to set the dependence of the modulation sensitivity by speed, i.e.  flexibly adjust the dynamics of cursor movement. <br>  - Displaying the image of the surface, as the sensor sees it, it helps when adjusting the sensor to a specific surface. <br>  This is what the W-Mouse settings window looks like. <br> <a href="http://ig0lka.h1n.ru/webimg/v.php%3Fid%3Ddfdbbdb598e49a25b027a139d2af3c02.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10d/986/41e/10d98641ea5041b7ca41b9bc0499a4b6.jpg"></a> <br><br>  I will tell you how did W-Mouse version W2-4.  Simply deciphered 2 - ATMEGA32U4 controller; 4 - Avago adns9500 sensor. <br>  The fact is that the W-mouse can be assembled in any case, and you can also choose a laser or optical sensor from the AVAGO sensor line.  Thus, everyone can assemble a mouse that would satisfy his desires and needs in terms of ergonomics, functionality and quality of work. <br>  I donor Oklick HUNTER mouse, I did not find a more convenient case for myself, although I tried quite a few different ones.

      W-Mouse w2-4 circuit <br> <a href="http://utforum.ru/eph/v.php%3Fid%3Dd8f06d03a1ac253707ae698c4d3de277.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75a/8db/b58/75a8dbb58f16ee663860b40644fa8e0c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  W-Mouse manufacturing steps: <br>  - cleaning the original board from unnecessary parts. <br>  - neatly soldering the adns9500 sensor,  so as not to break the tracks. <br>  - Connecting and testing the operation of the LED backlight. <br>  - preparation of the main board for installation of the controller board.  This includes the wiring of wires from the sensor and buttons, as well as the installation of mounting supports. <br>  - installation of the controller board and all parts except the sensor. <br>  - installation of the sensor at a height of 1.18mm, fixing and unsoldering it <br>  - verification of the soldering of all joints, 7 times.  (joke) <br>  - first start <br>  - fill the mouse firmware (author firmware Walkie) <br>  - housing assembly. <br><br>  It looked like a donor inside <br> <a href="http://ig0lka.h1n.ru/webimg/v.php%3Fid%3D55c4dadd25039e6eb8489f73e69c99cd.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c99/011/bd6/c99011bd6b32de00a72e9ab531cb0c06.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Previous w-mouse, I did the mounting by mounting, placing the controller directly on the cleaned from the unnecessary elements of the main board of the mouse, the spectacle is not very aesthetic, despite the fact that I tried to do as carefully as possible. <br><br>  This time I used a small fee. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/859/3bd/78d/8593bd78d73a24572d012cdcb2ee90a1.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9c/0ab/ffb/a9c0abffbea4874ff8f9a0c704b72ad6.jpg"><br>  This board was made for myself, a man with the nickname of the House Manager, but since the party was large, part of the boards went to enthusiasts like me. <br>  A controller with a strapping is placed on the board and all that remains is to connect it to the sensor, the backlight LEDs, the buttons and the wheel - and w-mouse is ready :) <br>  View of the main board, with prepared wiring for soldering them to the controller board. <br>  By the way, strips from several conductors from the IDE loop are used as loops. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a76/775/9a8/a767759a8ea207c2a052978def8fefe1.jpg"></a> <br><br>  View with installed controller board <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e08/e73/3cd/e08e733cd73032e35f2d693b17e60d05.jpg"></a> <br><br>  After that, the Adns 9500 sensor is soldered with flexible wiring to set the optimum height at which the best focus occurs. <br>  The task is to use the setup program, which allows you to see the surface image and changing the height of the sensor, to achieve the best focus.  The sensor is installed on the plates (spacers) of different thickness and according to the image read from the sensor, the most optimal height is determined. <br>  When determining the height of the sensor, I got 1.18 mm, this is the thickness of one SD disc.  It is surprising that the documentation indicates the optimal height of 2.4mm and all manufacturers of mice put the sensor to this height.  At the same time, the picture from the sensor is quite blurry ... incomprehensible ... <br>  Here is the picture from the adns9500 sensor, which is normally focused, glass black mat. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/023/69b/f5b/02369bf5b00c6dd30190570c7d3e8105.jpg"><br><br>  After determining the optimal height of the sensor, we finally put it on the board.  To do this, a hole is cut in the bottom of the case according to the shape of the base of the sensor lens.  The lens is placed on the plate with the desired height, the base of the mouse body is placed on top so that the lens together with the plate is in the cut-out hole.  A board is placed on top, on the sensor board, into the corresponding holes in the board.  The board is fixed with screws in the housing, after which the sensor is pressed against the lens and the terminals of the sensor are unsoldered.  The hole in the base of the case, from below, under the sensor, is closed with a neat black insert, for example, cut out of the dvd box.  After assembly, the appearance, of course, does not differ from what the donor looked like. <br><br>  View of the assembled mouse, it remains only to put the top cover. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a39/6f0/c4c/a396f0c4c1631acddbed2bffe4277a52.jpg"></a> <br><br>  W-mouse in combination with a glass pad provides very clear and unmistakable cursor control, which allows for example to make such pictures (click for a scale of 1 to 1): <br><br> <a href="http://ig0lka.h1n.ru/webimg/v.php%3Fid%3D4876ace04bb1df11807642bc26a6db99.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ac/8f0/446/3ac8f044668028ee30d02c184f68a452.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The picture was drawn and painted in the point.  The scale did not change  no zooms tricks.  At the time of drawing, on the monitor screen, the letters had a height of about 4-5 mm. <br><br>  I express my deep gratitude to Walkie for the W-Mouse project, as well as assistance in its manufacture. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197450/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197450/</a></p>
