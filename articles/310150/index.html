Knowing this law, Wargaming organizes a gemdev conference, where all those who are not indifferent to the world of gaming can recharge themselves with fresh ideas, find like-minded people, prepare the ground for future business and have a good time in one of the most picturesque cities in Eastern Europe. <br><br><h2>  Who performs? </h2><br>  Speeches at the conference will go in 4 streams: <br><br><ul><li>  People &amp; Production (for managers and leaders in the broad sense of the word); </li><li>  Technology &amp; Design (Art, Development, Design, UX and more); </li><li>  Business &amp; Data (all about the business component in operating products); </li><li>  Future &amp; Disruption (the future of games and new horizons that have yet to be opened). </li></ul><br>  Most of the speakers at 4C: Kyiv represent the game deeps of Europe and the USA and have never played in Ukraine and the CIS countries before. <br><br>  We will tell you more about some of them: <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Chris Taylor / Creating a Creative Team</b> <br>  <i>General Manager and Creative Director, Wargaming Seattle</i> <br><br>  A veteran of the gaming industry, the creator of Totall Anihilation and Supreme Commander.  He has been in game development for 28 years, during which time Chris has managed to work at Electronic Arts, Cavedog Entertainment, and set up his own studio, Gas Powered Games (GPG), which has now become part of Wargaming. <br><br>  Motivation and inspiration of game designers is one of the main tasks for the leader of such a creative team.  Chris will talk about the challenges that game designers take on large-scale projects.  There will be many examples in the presentation that will help you understand how the industry is changing and why it is important to constantly review our approach to game development. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Chet Faliszek / Virtual Reality in 2016</b> <br>  <i>Video Game Writer, Valve Corporation</i> <br><br>  One of the leading screenwriters Valve.  Together with colleagues, he worked on scenarios for the Half-Life and Portal series.  Also created characters for Left 4 Dead and Dota 2. <br><br>  This report will be devoted to the development of virtual reality.  He will tell you what we know and what we should prepare for after the global launch of VR this year. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Eric Simonich / Audience and You: A Brief History</b> <br>  <i>Creative Director, 2K Games</i> <br><br>  Creative Director XCOM 2, Evolve and Alane Wake.  Eric began his career with testing games for the Sega 32X.  After he got a job on the project for the PlayStation 1 and realized that his whole future life would be devoted to video games. <br>  In his report, Eric will briefly tell the story of the American entertainment industry and product design, as well as reflect on how the experience of these areas can be applied in the gaming industry. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Juuso Millirinn / Wave Crest Marketing</b> <br>  <i>Head of Global Marketing &amp; PR, Wargaming Nicosia</i> <br><br>  Professional with 15 years of experience in marketing.  Prior to Wargaming, he worked on brand strategies for international companies such as McDonald's, Nissan and MasterCard, managing a team of digital marketers in one of the Nokia divisions.  But Yuuso himself says that his horse is an incredibly difficult job of building business processes in the digital sphere. <br><br>  The world is changing faster and faster.  However, marketers continue to use the old ways of building relationships and communications.  Yuuso's presentation is devoted to new marketing opportunities that need to be adopted in order to always stay on the crest of a wave. <br><br><hr><br>  The full program can be found <a href="http://conf4c.com/">on the official conference website.</a> <br><br><h2>  How much is? </h2><br>  A conference ticket costs $ 36.
