"Real 3D"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53b/686/294/53b68629431d4688938da6ad9b864463.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Foreword </h3><br>  The notes of a madman are a series of articles in which they will be told about ideas, theories, and ideas.  Some of them will seem fiction, nonsense, absurdity.  I will say at once that they will not claim to be recognized by the public or reap any benefits.  It's just thinking out loud.  To take these notes seriously or not is your own business.  What will these posts give me?  First, I learn something new from commentators.  Secondly, perhaps, I will give someone an impetus for reflection.  Third, look at people's attitudes towards what seems unimaginable. <br><br><h3>  Introduction </h3><br>  So.  The topic of today's discussion will be the theory of projecting images in the air.  Why this topic?  I would be interested in designing devices like Tony Stark does.  I would be interested to watch a movie and walk inside it.  Who cares, I ask under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Theory </h3><br>  Now the market offers a sufficient number of prototypes and devices that are able to create three-dimensional images.  Someone projects images onto steam, someone onto gas, someone ionizes air at certain points.  All these systems are good.  But you do not build them into the house.  For a device that projects on steam, a special hood over the steam generator is needed.  For those who project on gas, a vessel is necessary.  The use of indoor ionization was described in a previous article about projecting an image. <br>  And what if you completely deviate from the principles that are embedded in those devices?  What if you learn to control the beam of light?  Wouldn't it be better? <br>  What do I mean by ‚Äúcontrol the beam‚Äù?  Create a glow at certain points in space.  How to implement it?  It is necessary to create a beam of a certain length with focusing at the end point.  You will be surprised.  According to the Kerr effect, the refractive index of air in the middle of the beam will be higher than at the edges.  Due to this optical inhomogeneity, the air medium formally behaves in relation to laser radiation as a collecting lens: the thickness of the beam decreases and the intensity of the light increases.  That is, the beam as it focuses itself - self-focusing occurs.  At first glance it seems that the beam is able to collapse to zero thickness.  However, when the light intensity reaches a certain value, multiphoton ionization occurs.  Laser photons knock electrons out of air molecules (nitrogen and oxygen molecules).  The released electrons form the plasma.  Compared to air, plasma has a lower refractive index, so it formally behaves like a diffusing lens and begins to defocus the beam, reducing its intensity.  Having passed through the area with the plasma, the beam continues its movement and the situation repeats.  The frequency of repetition of this effect depends on the frequency. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b9/da9/161/9b9da91619fd4ddcae27ebd2fb762a23.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 1. The processes of self-focusing (self-focusing) and defocusing (defocusing), allow the laser beam, without diverging, to overcome distances of tens and hundreds of meters.</i>  <i>In this case, the beam is mainly distributed in the medium through filaments specially created by it (or filament).</i>

      It should be noted that in addition to the high intensity, the laser pulse must also have a short duration ‚Äî of the order of the femtosecond (10‚Äì15 seconds).  Otherwise, instead of multiphoton ionization of the medium through which it passes, cascade ionization may occur: the concentration of released electrons becomes such that they begin to ionize the molecules even far from the passing laser beam.  This leads to an imbalance between self-focusing and defocusing.  The beam ceases to be focused and quickly diverges. <br>  It turns out that we only need to learn to achieve a certain intensity, at which the thickness of the beam approaches close to zero, but does not knock out the electrons that form the plasma, as well as learn to interrupt the filament in the right place.  How to achieve this, while not submitted.  To achieve this by controlling the state of the particles forming the beam or in some other way can be figured out only through experiments. <br>  Maybe you have some ideas? <br><br><h3>  Technical implementation </h3><br>  Suppose that we have curbed the laser radiation and we need to create a device.  How to get a picture for projection and how to project it? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3-CJufe79Io%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg87oPpVeOXKyjSaw0OqopHNOTYxg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the video above, a device is presented that scans space.  Each item in the end is a cloud of points, each of which has its own coordinates.  Knowing these coordinates, we can calculate the necessary parameters by specifying which the laser will display the desired point.  I was not lazy and sketched how I represent this device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd4/623/fa8/fd4623fa842645528ba7bb05c73b7404.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 2.

Central unit</i> <br><br>  Lasers are inserted into the holes of a sphere-shaped part, each of which is designated by its coordinate and projects its point.  As a result, we get the image consisting of points.  Increasing the number of lasers, we increase the resolution of the projection.  It is clear that energy consumption will increase.  But this will only encourage laser manufacturers to develop technology in the direction of reducing energy consumption.  In extreme cases, we will use nanotubes. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/y2vL_PR-yq4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhfrjupmM9ixvkAin8MauBoGWETUw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Watch from 16 minutes. <br>  To avoid a situation where one of the beams will be closed with something, a system of 5 devices is needed (1 main but 4 additional).  Post them according to this scheme: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fe/e4a/342/2fee4a3423f1468b94beb6a5785994b5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 4.

Only by learning how to manage the laws of physics can we create things that go beyond our understanding. <br><br>  <b>Reminder.</b>  <b>This article is the result of the conclusions of a person who may be mistaken.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362603/</a></p>
