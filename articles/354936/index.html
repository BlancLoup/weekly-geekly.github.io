Analysis without numbers is just an opinion. <br><br>  2. Creating the right rocket takes an infinite amount of time.  Therefore, you should create rockets in which something is wrong. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  3. Design is a cyclical process.  The number of iterations is always one more than it was already.  This is true at any stage. <br><br>  4. Your best practices in the final decision will not be needed.  Get used to live with it.

      5. (Miller's law) Three points is already a curve. <br><br>  6. On logarithmic paper, everything is straight. <br><br>  7. At the initial stages of development, the one who most wants to lead the work is the least suited for this role. <br><br>  8. In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle.  Do not trust the statements in which the optimum in the region of the extremum. <br><br>  9. The lack of information is not a reason to postpone the analysis of the decision. <br><br>  10. Not sure - decide approximately.  But be sure to return to the decision when the real numbers appear. <br><br>  11. Sometimes the quickest way to complete a project is to throw it all out and start over. <br><br>  12. The only true solution does not exist.  Although there are many infidels. <br><br>  13. Development is based on requirements.  There is no reason to do something at least a bit ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than indicated in the requirements. <br><br>  14. (Edison's Law) "The best" is the enemy of the "good." <br><br>  15. (Shea Law) All possibilities for improving the solution usually lie in the joints.  The joints are the main place for the "jambs". <br><br>  16. People who pondered this task before you did not have a direct connection with the wisdom of their ancestors.  Therefore, do not think that their decision was better than yours.  Moreover, it is not necessary to pass it off as your own. <br><br>  17. That the decision was published does not make it more true. <br><br>  18. Experience tests decisions in life.  Too much life testing can doom seemingly good decisions. <br><br>  19. The likelihood that you are much smarter than everyone else in your field is very small.  If in your calculations the final speed went out in two speeds of light, then you may have invented a teleport, but most likely you just messed up. <br><br>  20. A bad decision with a good report will be rejected over time.  A good decision with a bad report will be rejected immediately. <br><br>  21. (Larrabi's law) Half of what your teachers taught you is nonsense.  It remains to figure out that half.  This is the essence of education. <br><br>  22. If in doubt, document it.  (The need for documentation reaches a maximum shortly after the program closes). <br><br>  23. Schedule the term of the work that you make, always seems distracted fiction, as long as customers do not dismiss you for his failure. <br><br>  24. This is called the ‚ÄúWork Breakdown Structure‚Äù, because you will be Work until Breakdown comes, and you have to implement some Structure. <br><br>  25. (Bowden's law) After the failure of tests, one can always improve the calculations, showing that the negative probability was present initially. <br><br>  26. (Montemerlo law) Don't do nuthin 'dumb - don't do bullshit! <br><br>  27. (Law of Wars) Dates are shifted only in one direction. <br><br>  28. (Ranger's Law, sometimes erroneously Heinlein's Law) TANSTAAFL: There is no such thing as a free launch.  Roughly translated as "free feed only for slaughter" or "free just do not feed." <br><br>  29. (Von Tisenhausen project management law) To get roughly accurate final program requirements, multiply the initial requirements by the number Pi, and shift the decimal point one position to the right. <br><br>  30. (The law of engineering solutions von Tisenhausen) If you want your contribution to the design development of the engineering system to be maximum, learn to draw.  Engineers always end up doing something similar to a concept artist's picture. <br><br>  31. (The Law of the Evolutionary Development of Mo) One cannot reach the moon by climbing a higher tree each time. <br><br>  32. (The law of Atkin's demonstrations) When everything works as it should, really important visitors do not come. <br><br>  33. (Patton's Program Planning Law) A good plan is enforced now, better than perfect next week. <br><br>  34. (Roosevelt Task Planning Law) Do what you can, wherever you are, with what is at hand. <br><br>  35. (Saint-Exup√©ry Design Law) The designer knows that he has reached perfection, not when there is nothing to add, and when there is nothing to remove. <br><br>  36. An ordinary engineer makes elegant systems.  Good engineer - working.  This engineer - effective. <br><br>  37. (Hanshaw's Law) The most important thing in the success of the program is to clearly line the ranks of the perpetrators. <br><br>  38. Opportunities increase the requirements, ignoring the limitations of textbooks. <br><br>  39. Any space program in which the "development" of a new rocket "turned out", in fact, there is a program for developing a new rocket. <br><br>  39. (alternative wording) Three rules for the preservation of space programs within the budget and terms: <br><br>  1) No new missiles. <br>  2) No new missiles. <br>  3) Do anything, just no new missiles. <br><br>  40. (Mc-Brian's Law) It is not necessary to improve what has not yet worked. <br><br>  41. There is never enough time to make all the necessary elements, but for some reason there is always enough time to make a lot of unnecessary things. <br><br>  42. Cosmos does not at all forgive mistakes.  If the engineer made a mistake then someone would die (and there is no such thing as ‚Äúpartial fault‚Äù, they say, basically, the decision was correct). <br><br>  <a href="http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/akins_laws.html"><b>Original</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354936/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354936/</a></p>
