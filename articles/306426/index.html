  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Automation of work with servers using Hewlett Packard Enterprise Server Automation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Modern enterprises in their work use more and more servers.  Because of this, the number of routine tasks required for their implementation of tools, standards that must be followed in the operation of the system increases significantly.  This, in turn, increases maintenance costs, as well as losses due to a variety of failures.  As a solution to most problems, you can use automation.  One of them is Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Server Automation.  This software is designed to centralize management and production of a variety of data center functions, as well as automating critical places in the management of IT infrastructure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af5/9c4/89d/af59c489de094a3ca7120b3b839c9666.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Introduction to the server</b> <br><br>  HPE Server Automation scans the network for servers that are not managed by the program and displays them in a special list.  Then the administrator connects these servers to the system by installing software modules on each of them.  Once this is done, you can perform management tasks on them, including the following: <br><br>  <i>Deploying the operating system on dedicated resources</i> : allows you to allocate physical space on the server or create virtual servers for pre-configured operating systems and enter them into the managed server pool.  After this, HPE Server Automation can manage the newly created resources. <br><br>  <i>Automatic OS upgrade</i> : HPE Server Automation can perform an automated, centralized and flexible update of operating systems and install the necessary patches.  This applies to servers based on the OS family of Windows, Linux and Solaris.  You can select the required patches from those offered by the operating system vendor, as well as customize the installation process to ignore patches that are incompatible with the server environment. <br><br>  <i>Software initialization</i> : after the server has entered the managed pool, you can install and configure applications using special templates, better known as software policies (Software Policies).  These templates determine which software to install, which configurations will be used, and the scripts that will be used during the installation.  These templates allow you to define a basic server configuration that will be deployed on all managed units in accordance with the HPE Server Automation Software compliance functions.  For example, you can install the basic version of Apache on all servers that are running HPE Server Automation, and on a given part of them. <br><br>  <i>Audit and Compliance</i> : The Audit and Remediation feature gives you the opportunity to learn the server configuration policies and make sure that they comply with them.  In the event that non-compliances are detected or the servers are not configured the way you want, this can be corrected programmatically.  So, you can configure a basic server and, based on its image, automatically configure all the others, adjusting them to the policy you set. <br><br>  <i>Software configuration</i> : you can create application configuration templates and deploy them on all servers running HPE Server Automation.  You can also check the standardization of configuration files on all servers in the pool. <br><br>  <i>Deploying Applications</i> : With this feature, you can quickly and easily move a complex of applications from the development team to testers and further along the chain. <br><br>  <i>Software</i> Compliance <i>Verification</i> : Using the Policy Compliance Scan tool, you can determine if the software policy specification of the managed server matches the configuration of the software installed on it. <br><br>  <i>Reporting</i> : HPE Server Automation provides an extensive set of comprehensive reports on the status of managed servers.  These reports can be flexibly customized, allowing you to present them to various categories of users. <br><br>  HPE Server Automation allows you to make changes to various systems more safely and flexibly.  This is due to the fact that you can model and verify the changes you make before you really make them.  As a result, server downtime is significantly reduced, as the changes that are being made for the first time have already been tested for performance.  You do not need to debug them and fix errors immediately after making changes or installing updates. <br><br>  <b>HPE Server Automation Configuration</b> <br><br>  A simple HPE Server Automation installation package consists of the system core, its components, and the Oracle database hosted on a single server.  More advanced packages may have additional elements: <br><br>  - secondary cores that complement the main core and increase the power to manage servers; <br><br>  - satellites similar in functionality to conventional cores, but with more limited capabilities.  They are used for data centers and IT infrastructures with limited requirements or resources; <br><br>  - Multi-master connection, which allows two independent systems to exchange data and jointly manage servers. <br><br>  HPE Server Automation supports installation in eight designated configurations.  Other configurations require HPE Professional Services. <br><br>  <i>Simple configuration</i> <br><br>  HPE Server Automation installs a number of components that provide server management capabilities.  If you do not need to customize the installation of the product, you can select the installation for a single host.  If you need to configure (for example, to distribute the kernel components across different servers for performance reasons), then you need to contact HPE certified consultants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94b/dee/627/94bdee6278f94faab7fbcfc58a23e2df.png"><br><br>  The easiest installation case is to deploy a system for a single data center or site.  It consists of all the automation components of HPE Server Automation installed on the same server management host on the same network. <br><br>  <i>Oracle database</i> <br><br>  All deployment options require an Oracle database configured specifically for HPE Server Automation.  One of its components is used to store information about your network, storage devices, managed servers (along with operating systems and applications installed on them), and so on.  This database is part of the installation package, but you can also use an existing Oracle database that has been configured for use with HPE Server Automation. <br><br>  <i>Deploying Applications</i> <br><br>  Using the HPE Server Automation application deployment feature, you can create, test, and deploy custom software for target servers in your data centers.  For example, you can move applications from developers to testers to provide better quality testing.  The application deployment tool simplifies the communications needed to deploy applications.  It provides a single access point where all involved in the development process, employees can view or enter the data with which they work.  With this tool you can also: <br><br>  - simulate application components such as code, scripts, configuration files; <br><br>  - manage multiple parallel releases and versions of your applications; <br><br>  - deploy and collapse applications on target servers, roll back their versions in case of unstable operation and the presence of errors; <br><br>  - simulate target servers running the elements necessary for applications; <br><br>  - to establish convenient and fast communication between developers, testers, system administrators and other authorized personnel; <br><br>  - plan and implement application development cycles ranging from writing code to product release.  You can customize Hewlett Packard Enterprise Server Automation depending on the type of enterprise, the standards adopted and the way it works. <br><br>  <i>Audit and rectification</i> <br><br>  The audit and error correction feature allows you to set objects, places, and times to inspect objects that are part of your IT infrastructure.  A variety of verification policies determine what needs to be checked ‚Äî specific files, directories, and specific configurations.  Also determined by the place of verification: it can be specific servers or their entire groups.  And the ability to create a test schedule automates this process ‚Äî for example, you can set specific inspection dates and determine their regularity (the check can be either a one-time or planned repetition). <br><br>  HPE Server Automation capabilities also help you understand how to make servers in a managed environment compatible.  So, you can activate the server compliance option for specific policy standards.  When the system detects servers that do not meet specified standards, you can correct their work so that it conforms to accepted standards. <br><br>  Using the HPE Server Automation client, you can check the values ‚Äã‚Äãof server configuration parameters based on a working server with the correct parameters or an image of a similar server.  You can also make checks based on your own settings or on the basis of pre-configured audit policies.  In addition, it is possible to receive reports on the status of specific servers to check the current state of the system and to compare with other servers. <br><br>  Audit policies allow you to determine whether the security standards adopted in a company or an entire field correspond to the current state of affairs.  You can also define such standards yourself.  They will be used for auditing, reporting, and other audit policies. <br><br>  Using audit tools for repair and recovery, you can also perform the following tasks: <br><br>  - compare servers and system snapshots with specified servers and snapshots; <br>  - create checks that will be executed regularly; <br>  - create verification policies that set standards for interoperability and security for your organization; <br>  - create specific checks for specific servers or server groups. <br>  - fix problems at different levels, including problems with files, directories, patches, registry keys, packages, etc. <br><br>  <b>Features Hewlett Packard Enterprise Server Automation</b> <br><br>  The product in question represents a set of capabilities that automate many IT processes.  They include tools such as Service Automation Visualizer, Storage Visibility and Automation, as well as a reporting system. <br><br>  <i>Service Automation Visualizer (SAV)</i> <br><br>  This tool is designed to help you optimally understand and manage your operational architecture and distributed business applications in your IT environment.  As you know, these applications consist of complex sets of various services running on multiple servers, as well as network and storage devices.  In this regard, when performance problems arise, it is difficult to determine their causes and eliminate them.  It also becomes obscure what will be the result of making any changes in the IT environment.  The SAV tool allows you to visualize this type of information using pictures.  They can be displayed on the monitor or printed on paper. <br><br>  <i>Storage Visibility and Automation</i> <br><br>  This tool allows you to manage data storage through visualization from the beginning to the end of the entire chain of data in the repository.  This is very useful for performing routine tasks of system administrators.  They are provided with funds that help save space (and, consequently, money) by considering the available resources, conducting an audit of the repositories, analyzing the trends in the use of resources, creating various scenarios and automating processes. <br><br>  <i>Reports</i> <br><br>  HPE Server Automation's real-time reporting system provides the user with a variety of information regarding managed servers, network devices, software, patches, operating systems, clients and objects (virtual and physical) and the application of various policies.  You can also get security reports and user actions. <br><br>  <b>Resource Deployment System</b> <br><br>  HPE Server Automation allows you to install preconfigured operating systems on physical and virtual servers.  The procedure is quick and with minimal human involvement.  This feature is a key part of the server startup process.  The automatic deployment feature ensures that every server on your site will by default have a standardized operating system configuration.  The advantages of this system include: <br><br>  <i>- Integration with other features and tools of HPE Server Automation</i> .  Since the resource deployment system is tightly integrated with a set of automation tools (including automatic patch management, software management, script execution, and so on), this ensures smooth transfer of work between different departments.  This ensures that different groups of IT departments will work with an understanding of the processes going on, the overall state of the work environment.  This is one of the pledges of productive work and reliable control over the implementation of changes. <br><br>  <i>- Ability to upgrade software servers without reinstalling</i> .  Unlike many other similar solutions, HPE Server Automation's resource deployment system makes it easy to make changes after installation.  This is due to the use of special templates and an installation-oriented approach to work. <br><br>  <i>- Flexible architecture designed to work in many environments</i> .  The HPE Server Automation deployment system supports many different types of servers, networks, security architectures, and operational processes.  This flexibility ensures that you can deploy the necessary operating systems according to the needs of your organization. <br><br>  You can perform HPE Server Automation functions from both the regular and web clients.  The system automates all typical deployment tasks, namely: <br><br>  - Preparation of equipment for the installation of the operating system using the prepared OS installation profile and the use of specified sequences; <br><br>  - Drawing up plans that represent a list of tasks that must be performed on the server before and after installing the operating system.  Such plans have a higher priority than the specified installation sequence; <br><br>  - Installation of the basic and default configuration of the operating system in accordance with a given sequence or construction plan. <br>  - Install all the latest patches for operating systems (the list depends on the applications running on the server); <br><br>  - Execution of certain scripts before and after installing the OS, which specify certain configuration parameters, such as the root password; <br><br>  - Installation of system components and utilities, such as, for example, Secure Shell, PC Anywhere, antivirus software and data backup software, system monitoring tools; <br><br>  - Installation of common system software, such as Java Virtual Machine. <br><br>  HPE Server Automation Deployment System supports: <br><br>  - Windows, Solaris and Linux; <br>  - network installation and installation from physical media (CD / DVD); <br>  - and also allows you to distribute duties between data center employees and system administrators. <br><br>  The system also integrates with native installation technologies used in different operating systems: <br><br>  - Windows answer files: unattend.txt, unattend.xml, sysprep.inf <br>  - Red Hat Kickstart <br>  - SuSE YaST (Yet another Setup Tool) <br>  - Solaris Jumpstart <br>  - WINPE / WIN-BCOM / UNDI <br><br>  You can deploy the operating system to: <br><br>  - physical servers on which HPE Server Automation agent is not installed and there is no operating system; <br>  - virtual servers; <br>  - servers included in the pool not managed by HPE Server Automation servers and having installed OS; <br>  - servers included in the pool of servers managed by HPE Server Automation and having installed OS (re-deployment). <br><br>  <b>Running scripts</b> <br><br>  Using the script execution function HPE Server Automation allows you to run one-time or saved scripts across the entire pool of managed servers in automatic mode, rather than manually.  For system administrators, this provides the following benefits: <br><br>  - parallel execution of scripts on many UNIX and / or Windows servers, which significantly saves time and ensures a high degree of consistency; <br><br>  - access control is based on the principle that only authorized administrators can execute scripts on the hosts to which they have access; <br><br>  - the ability to control access to scripts, storing them in private or public libraries; <br><br>  - the ability to configure scripts in groups when administrators can access information about the status of servers.  This is important so that the necessary scripts are executed on the necessary servers; <br><br>  - a comprehensive report log that shows when and where a particular script was executed and who is responsible for it. <br><br>  Because script execution tools are an integral part of HPE Server Automation, system administrators have unique advantages over third-party tools: <br><br> ‚Äî                          HPE Server Automation.        ,   ,         ,       . . <br><br> ‚Äî         ,   HPE Server Automation   ,         ,       . <br><br> <b>  </b> <br><br>    HPE Server Automation  Device Explorer        .        : <br><br> ‚Äî    ,   ,   ,         ; <br><br> ‚Äî    , , ,  ,    ; <br><br> ‚Äî        ; <br><br>       : <br><br> ‚Äî    ,       ; <br><br> ‚Äî        ‚Äî    ; <br><br> ‚Äî       . <br><br> <b> </b> <br><br> HPE        .
