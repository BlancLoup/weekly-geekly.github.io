In addition, in the previous article I could not demonstrate how the jumpers themselves look like for the ‚Äútransformation‚Äù of Tetris, so I will be very brief, and I apologize to those who expected a more detailed review. <br><br>  Since I got into the hands of an old Tetris, I decided to share my impressions with you.

      Interested please under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Video of the process itself: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGG5UabkfNQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhihf2XJU1OfsfjcHsPVTDIHzCn0bA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  I apologize for the quality (no matter how ironic, in my FullHD camera there is no autofocus, at some moments I had to use a lens to adjust the focus manually). <br><br>  In this video, I filmed the process of opening the tetris and its ‚Äútransformation‚Äù from ‚Äú138 in 1‚Äù to ‚Äú118 in 1‚Äù.  As far as I understood, Tetris was dismantled before me and repeatedly.  In some places, there were already not only screws, but also places where to screw them.  In some places the thread was broken, there were cracks. <br><br>  Parsing tetris <br>  The first shock for me was the lack of electronics on the top side of the board. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ade/fb9/d42/adefb9d42f0190eed6b5ed564f6ff85e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Having examined Tetris, I found what was hanging inside the body.  It was one of the graphite keyboard contacts. <br>  Ironically, saying "something fell off."  Exactly the same "gum" were torn and fell off in my tetris.  Oh, and I tortured myself with them once. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52a/d69/a2d/52ad69a2d9aa25f55559e1a1b071f030.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a6/97e/878/3a697e878659fdd26c9b688bdb3ab57c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I was very surprised by the two jumpers on the top of the board in the form of blue wires.  In addition, I did not plan to remove the board from the screen at all - this could lead to the fact that after achieving contact of the board with the screen it would be very difficult, if possible at all.  And I couldn‚Äôt imagine how I would tinker with the jumpers and test the ‚Äútransformation‚Äù with the screen removed, because it was necessary to see how many games it displays. <br>  The cogs that kept the board on the screen did not inspire confidence at all.  Of the six, only two held firmly.  Apparently they were unscrewed and they were once by someone. <br><br>  To my delight from the bottom of the board, I found three treasured jumpers, which were practically the same as in my Tetris (two horizontal and one vertical).  I may be wrong, because  I saw them in my Tetris for a long time and I don‚Äôt remember exactly. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef7/a37/cce/ef7a37cce81d96a010f849cde689397c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, to the point! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c36/03c/331/c3603c331a6c1fecc41a4ce26cd36d91.png"><br><br>  Next, armed with probes from the tester, one side of which I short-circuited, and the other side, I began to close the first jumper. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/894/ad6/245/894ad62451fe32bf5cb529ee3c6ad8e6.png"><br><br>  I was tormented by glory.  The only time it turned out and he was not on camera.  (Therefore, in the video I already knew what mode this jumper switches to).  The problem is that this tetris model has a memory. <br>  The most reliable method for switching Tetris to another mode is to act in the following sequence: <br>  - remove the battery <br>  - close jumper <br>  - insert the battery <br>  - enable tetris <br><br>  Finally, I did: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f65/bbc/8e9/f65bbc8e90179606ea88049eb4aa84cf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, what is the point of such a downgrade, as soon as not just a demonstration.  I did not look for other jumper combinations, as I just wanted to demonstrate this possibility. <br><br>  The surprise for me was that Tetris remained ‚Äú118 in 1‚Äù even after it was turned off and assembled, and turned back only after removing the battery.  Having removed the battery, I thought that it was already over - it did not turn on the first time, but everything worked out. <br><br>  During the experiments.  It turned out that Tetris "138 in 1" was not at all from my Tetris series, I did not immediately understand it (I simply did not pay attention).  I determined this by hoping to apply the instructions from my own. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fe/83a/2a7/6fe83a2a703bae4a5f35d089a7257940.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But in my instructions, there is no such as ‚Äú138 in 1‚Äù at all.  Note it earlier, this article and the video could not be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5b/ed6/eb4/c5bed6eb41acd0377d599565987dd7b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  That's all, I hope it was interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221609/</a></p>
