  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to design programs and their user interfaces, or DISC theory for ‚Äúnon-licenses‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How often does a programmer face the choice of target audience?  I, frankly, I can not especially call myself a programmer, but this is connected very closely.  I am a customer, and in fact a project manager.  As a rule, this question arises at the moment when you design a new application.  Whether it is a module for 1C, a web site or an application for the iPhone - the task is obvious.  It is necessary that the user was comfortable. <br>  As a rule, we try everything on ourselves - if it is clear to me, it is convenient for me, it means that the user will be comfortable.  And in practice, we are faced with a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù situation where the user cannot find a button or function that is for you in an obvious place.  So let's see where such misunderstandings come from? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If you look at the statistics, as a rule, programmers are people quite educated, for whom knowledge is one of the basic values.  For people with such values, logic, information, accuracy is very important.  And who are the main consumers of the products of programmers? <br>  Of course it depends on the scope: <br><ul><li>  if you write under 1C, this is obviously either an accountant or a salesperson (although managers also use it); </li><li>  if banking products, then these are clerks of banks and their leaders; </li><li>  if the game - it all also depends on the type of game; </li><li>  if you write sites - they also have target audiences. </li></ul><br>  There is always an end user image.  And it is necessary to define it specifically. <br><br><h4>  A bit of history </h4><br>  About a year ago, I discovered one theory, which turned my perception of clients, employees, and, in general, people as such.  This is the DISC theory.  It was developed back in the 1930s of the last century, but it still does not lose its relevance.  Its developer is <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25A3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC">Dr. William Molton-Marston</a> .  He was one of the first to create a valid lie detector. <br>  Marston divided all people, conditionally, of course, on those who perceive the environment as friendly and focused on people and those who perceive it as hostile and task-oriented.  And then again he divided everyone, into those who perceive themselves as stronger than the environment and active, and into those who consider themselves weaker than the environment and passive. <br>  As a result, he got four behavioral patterns.  Marston gave each of them a name and with the help of observations described their characteristic patterns of behavior.

These are very active people, they can‚Äôt sit, they are always busy, they are demanding and tough.  They rarely pay attention to details. <br>  <b>Influence</b> ( <i>I, Influence</i> ) are people who consider themselves stronger than the environment and are active, and perceive the world as friendly and people-oriented.  They are bright, fast, sociable and open, they are ‚Äústars‚Äù.  It is important for them to be visible, approved by other people.  They rarely get things done. <br>  <b>Stability</b> ( <i>S, Steadiness</i> ) - these are people who consider themselves weaker than the environment and passive, and perceive the world as friendly and people-oriented.  People of this type are very reliable, they are caring, friendly, but somewhat slow and do not make decisions quickly, they are not decisive.  These are people of the process. <br>  <b>Compliance</b> ( <i>C, Compliance</i> ) - these are people who consider themselves weaker than the environment and passive, and perceive the world as hostile and task oriented.  These are people who are interested in procedures and rules, they make decisions carefully and slowly.  They are critical and skeptical.  It is often very smart. <br>  This is a very short characteristic of these four types.  To make it clearer, I will give a few examples.  A lawyer is a profession.  But she has a lot of directions. <br>  The judge is often the type of ‚ÄúD‚Äù (Dominance), the type of activity requires dominance, authoritativeness, decisiveness, especially not to empathize. <br>  A lawyer is a type of ‚ÄúI‚Äù (Influence): active, bright, expressive, articulate, sociable. <br>  The legal adviser at the enterprise - often type ‚ÄúS‚Äù - desire for stability, quiet work, routine, ambitions are not high. <br>  Notary - often "C" - clear rules, procedures, details and perseverance are important. <br>  Also, the famous personalities of each type are quite indicative: <br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúD‚Äù - Joseph Stalin, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Viktor Yanukovych, Margaret Thatcher. </li><li>  ‚ÄúI‚Äù - Bill Clinton, Zhirinovsky, Richard Branson, Yulia Timoshenko, Jim Carrey. </li><li>  "S" - John Paul II, mother Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi, Princess Diana. </li><li>  ‚ÄúC‚Äù - Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, Al Gore, Viktor Yushchenko, Mykola Azarov. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  How can this be applied to programming? </h4><br>  As a rule, you can imagine your end user.  Create his approximate portrait. <br>  Answer simple questions: <br>  What is the nature of his activity (not a profession, but what exactly does he do)? <br>  What is the pace of his work? <br>  If he is engaged in this activity, what are his values? <br>  How much time does he spend with your application? <br>  Does your end user matter the process or just the end result? <br>  The future product interface, functionality and capabilities will depend on the answers to these questions. <br><br><h4>  Features of each type in the perception of software </h4><br>  Each of the behavioral styles has its own characteristics of perception of information, its own values ‚Äã‚Äãand pace of movement.  Next, we will examine exactly what features of each type. <br><br><h5>  Type "D" </h5><br>  In the post-Soviet countries, in Russia, Ukraine, most often leaders are people of the type ‚ÄúD‚Äù - ‚Äústrong hand‚Äù (in Germany - more often ‚ÄúC‚Äù, in Italy - ‚ÄúI‚Äù).  Also very often sellers in active sales are also ‚ÄúD‚Äù type - ‚Äúfighters‚Äù.  More often, the ‚ÄúD‚Äù style is carried out by law enforcement officers (especially opera), sportsmen.  Therefore, if your product is focused on managers or sellers, then the following should be considered. <br>  People of this type are quick, so if you need to answer a lot of questions, fill out forms, and do detailed reports, that‚Äôs just unnerving.  They would rather refuse than use such a product.  If there is a simple wizard in the program, an assistant who can be clicked ‚Äúon‚Äù, ‚Äúon‚Äù is for them. <br>  They do not pay attention to details.  Therefore, what is IMPORTANT should be noticeable. <br>  If the program slows down a bit, it is very annoying because of their natural impatience. <br>  For them, the status and the result is also important.  Therefore, in the description of the program should be clearly described, in a few words, what results gives the product. <br><br><h5>  Type "I" </h5><br>  Artists, designers, artists, stylists, show-men and musicians - most often they are people of the ‚ÄúI‚Äù style.  Just as often, PR advocates, advertisers, and leaders of a charismatic type also belong to this behavioral style.  They are often very unorganized, so reminders should be foreseen in the functional or something like that. <br>  They also love to be in sight and everything is bright, so the design of software that is meant for people of this type should be given special attention (they probably noticed how different musical programs look like: everything is painted, on metal, it glitters).  For example, for the ‚ÄúC‚Äù style - design, this is a minor issue, for them the most important information. <br>  Due to the fact that the order for ‚ÄúI‚Äù is simply intolerable, if you can move icons, buttons, etc. in your software, make sure to prominently make a button - ‚ÄúReturn everything as it was at the beginning‚Äù.  They can just forget what and where they moved. <br>  People of type ‚ÄúI‚Äù are focused on relationships, so if the program provides customer profiles, counterparties, there is and make room for photos, it will be in demand. <br>  People of the ‚ÄúI‚Äù style are those who have the most completed profiles on Odnoklasniki or VKontakte with a bunch of photos and lots of friends. <br><br><h5>  Type "S" </h5><br>  In banking institutions, in positions of tellers, cashiers, credit managers, etc., people most often work with the prevailing type ‚ÄúS‚Äù (Stability).  Also, secretaries, accountants, civil servants (clerical) are also most often people with this behavioral type. <br>  They are rather plodding, but due to the fact that for type ‚ÄúS‚Äù indecision is one of the prevailing character traits, the software product must necessarily contain detailed hints with options for all occasions.  They most often need support, because if they don‚Äôt understand something they will prefer to simply refuse to use a function or product as a whole, rather than disturbing someone.  That is why the forms and contacts of support should be available at a glance. <br>  They are very fond of stability, so if you plan to change the interface of the program in the next version, for them it can be a tragedy.  They most often resist new programs (as well as all changes), but when they get used to it they are regular customers who are with you forever. <br><br><h5>  Type "C" </h5><br>  Experts, technologists, programmers, controllers, editors, scientists (exact sciences) are most often representatives of type ‚ÄúC‚Äù.  Also often they are deputy directors, chief accountants, bankers (of higher rank). <br>  For people of this type, the main value is information.  These are users of expert systems, they like reports, statistics. <br>  For them, the program interface should be concise and informative.  They are irritated by various graphic elements. <br>  Due to the fact that they are very observant and pay attention to the details, errors in the programs and texts simply enrage them.  These are the users who send error reports.  They are the best software beta testers. <br>  They are also consumers of quality.  They are willing to pay good money for quality products. <br>  For people like ‚ÄúC‚Äù the most important thing is logic, therefore the structuredness of the information provided is very important for them. <br><br><h5>  Instead of conclusion </h5><br>  All of the above, these are trends.  Most often you can just observe this in successful software products in a particular area.  Often the reason for this success is not only that the developers fell into the desired target category with their product.  And also guessed with the details and values ‚Äã‚Äãfor their target audience. <br><br>  You can still write a lot about the theory of DISC, but within the framework of one article it will not fit.  If this topic is interesting to Habrasoobshchestvo, it will be continued. <br>  Possible topics: <br>  "Theory of DISC in the construction of project teams." <br>  ‚ÄúProgrammer and family.  Relationships in a team and family.  DISC for non-lichen. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111401/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111401/</a></p>
