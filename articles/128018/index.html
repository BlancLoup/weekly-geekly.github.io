You draw up a daily routine, a plan for the week, a strategy for the month, but in the evening all of a sudden &lt;insert sudden&gt; until nightfall, and in the morning you can‚Äôt get up?  Everything is very bad.  And if you know the meaning of the word <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">procrastination</a> (though, in fairness, who in the Habr√© does not know him?), Then this is practically a clinical case.

    <h5>  Who are all these people? </h5><br>  Yes, who are all these people who develop methodologies for successful work?  Which conduct motivational workshops.  Which calculate the losses of the economy from insufficient motivation of people ... or from an extra day off in a year (yes, yes, as I heard the news a long time ago, that by extending the New Year holidays for a week, the state loses about 2% of something there, GDP, perhaps ... mathematics so amazing that I couldn‚Äôt come to my senses during that week. It‚Äôs necessary, they guessed that 1 (one) week is already 2 (two)% losses ... just amazing, amazing and exciting. Especially considering that 52 weeks a year, 1 week this is 2%).  So, I will tell you who all these people are - verbiage, demagogues and businessmen.  And I do not need to say that they are successful and have achieved everything.  I myself know, exactly the same as you know.  Exactly the same as the political elite in your country is successful and has achieved everything, but you consider them to be the same verbiage. <br>  And this is not surprising, I would even say that this is normal.  After all, the main law of economics - demand creates supply.  So our with you demand, the demand of lazy people (and if you think that you are an example of hard work and laziness is not your fault, then look deeply into yourself ... even deeper, we will wait) to justify your laziness, gives rise to a proposal for these same excuses. <br><br>  The abnormality of the situation is only in the fact that once again we are trying to deal with the investigation, only sometimes thinking about the cause.  The rest of the situation is normal, but hopeless.  Just as in other areas, the roads are poorly constructed, but next year there is something to be repaired;  bribe takers are bad people, but it is easier to pass a bill between documents to the traffic police inspector than to run to pay the fine;  there is no time to develop the architecture and design of the system, but to rewrite everything from scratch, because it turned out badly - this is please. <br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe whole article is simple: <br><blockquote>  No one, never, no GTD methodology helped to do the work the way it should have been done. </blockquote><br>  And do not talk about the charms of that and the wonders of this approach.  Because to be treated for the flu every fall and not to hurt them are two different things. <br><br>  In fact, everything is simple, if you think that you need some sort of GTD system, you are simply not in the right place.  After all, we often see how people, after a hard day, when they have to literally live out per second until the end of their working hours, suddenly take wing and run: to the gym, to a rehearsal, to a date, to prepare a Peking duck or to pick the <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_KDE2_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4_FreeBSD">KDE</a> Linux kernel. <br>  And no matter how banal it all sounded, I did not see people who are passionate about their work, suffering from procrastination.  Well, maybe a little bit. <br><br><h5>  So what? </h5><br>  But actually nothing.  No one will ever tell you what to do about it.  Moreover, it is beneficial for all that you are.  Because when you are like this - you are in the system, which means everyone knows what to expect from you and how you can use it.  It all starts with childhood and parents.  Then secondary, special, higher.  Then work.  And all this time we are within the framework of a certain system that sets its rules (I‚Äôll note that I don‚Äôt believe in universal human governance and global enslavement, simply because the system is too complex. There are no laws of man according to which she lives, there are laws of the universe , the rest is particular).  We accept these rules.  We learn from the one whom the parents said or rebel and we do it out of luck.  Going to work where we were recommended or just where we were taken.  We work as the next GTD method says.  The main thing that we do as someone, something, somewhere, but not in the right way.  So how should it be? <br><br><h5>  Not about GTD </h5><br>  In general, there is nothing bad in the system.  Systematization and order - yes it is just great!  The main thing is to find your harmony in this system.  Unfortunately, very rarely a person knows himself well enough at that age when he lays the first stones on the foundation of his future life.  And then he does not have the strength to change something ... of course there is no strength, because he grew up, gained experience and his mind acquired sufficient sharpness to find a dozen excuses to just do nothing.  For most, fighting with yourself is lost in advance.  Just because no one knows what exactly needs to be overcome in oneself ... that's all they struggle with - overweight, bad habits, with laziness and another thousand with one vice.  Everyone fights and does not understand that struggle is the path of destruction.  There are no winners, there are just not conditionally losers.  And you can still long to paint and philosophize, but ... <br>  The main call of the whole article is also simple: <br><blockquote>  Work on harmony with yourself.  Harmony with everything else will come by itself.  Immediately. </blockquote><br><br>  PS In the end, I wrote not exactly what I wanted.  But it often happens when you start to put your thoughts in order ‚Äúon paper‚Äù, you always come to something new.  A bunch of topics in the end remained unaffected: ( <br>  PPS If you still have a question, why did I write all this, I will answer.
