      I wrote the first line of code at 6 years old.  Although I am not a child prodigy.  Then my father helped me a lot.  But I already got hooked.  I liked it. <br><br>  At 15, I was already working half-time at my father's consulting company.  Sawed sites and kodil small components for business applications on weekends and summer. <br><br>  I was terribly underpaid.  But as my father still likes to say, then I received a free room and table, as well as a fairly valuable working experience. <br><br>  Later, I managed to help pay for part of my training as a freelancer.  I have created several e-commerce sites for some local companies. <br><br>  At 21 I had a regular job as a programmer at an interactive marketing company in Toronto, Canada. <br><br>  The company was founded by a doctor of medicine and many of its clients were large pharmaceutical companies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In Canada, there are strict restrictions on how pharmaceutical companies can advertise prescription drugs directly to consumers. <br><br>  As a result, these companies create websites that provide general information about any symptoms for which their medications are intended.  Then, when the visitor proves that he has a prescription, he can access the patient portal with more detailed information about the medicine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/256/8ef/448/2568ef448be81af67981f4724b8b32b2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://www.edfactscanada.com/">Home page</a> edfactsanada.com circa 2001, The Internet Archive <br><br>  One of the projects in which I worked was about a drug for women.  The graphics and general style of the site made it clear that the client wanted to specifically target an adolescent girl audience. <br><br>  One of the features of the site was the survey, where the girls were asked a series of questions and, based on their answers, they were recommended drugs. <br><br>  Let me remind you that the site was positioned as an independent informational, and not as an advertisement for a specific drug. <br><br>  When I received the requirements, they contained survey questions and answer choices for each of them. <br><br>  The only thing missing in the requirements was what to do with the answers at the end of the survey.  What rules determine what treatment the survey should recommend? <br><br>  I discussed this issue with the customer service manager.  She wrote to the customer and received the requirements.  I continued to code. <br><br>  Before presenting the site to the customer, my project manager decided to check it out quickly.  She tried the survey and then came to me: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe survey is not working,‚Äù she said. <br><br>  "Oh ... what's broken?" I asked. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMmm ... it seems that no matter what I answer, the survey recommends the client's drug as the best treatment.  The only exception is if I say that I have an allergy.  Or if I say I already accept it. ‚Äù <br><br>  "Yes.  This is exactly what was in the TK.  Any answers lead to the client‚Äôs drug. ‚Äù <br><br>  "Ah ... ok, good." </blockquote><br>  And she left. <br><br>  When I first saw these requirements, they disturbed me.  I sensed in one place that I was writing code for something that, in principle, was created to deceive young girls.  But I drove those thoughts away.  I needed the <s>loot</s> to do the work and I did it. <br><br>  None of what we did was illegal.  I was the youngest developer in my team and I earned good money for my age.  In the end, I realized that the real purpose of the site was to promote a certain drug.  I wrote off this tactic on ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù. <br><br>  The client was extremely pleased with the site.  So much so that their representative invited me and the whole team for dinner. <br><br>  On the day of dinner, shortly before leaving the office, a colleague sent me a link to the news.  She was about a young girl who was taking <i>this</i> drug. <br><br>  She committed suicide. <br><br>  It turned out that among the side effects of this drug were severe depression and suicidal tendencies. <br><br>  The colleague who sent me this link did not come to dinner. <br><br>  But I still went.  It was hard and awkward.  I did not say a word about the news.  Just quietly chewing your steak and squeezing a smile. <br><br>  The next day I called my 19 year old sister.  When I was working on a project, the glade that <i>this</i> drug was prescribed. <br><br>  When we first talked about this, we thought it was a pure coincidence.  But now the tone of our conversation was completely different.  I advised her to stop taking the medicine as soon as possible.  Fortunately, she listened to me. <br><br>  For me, there are a million and one ways to rationalize complicity in subsequent suicides and severe depression.  Even today, the trial is still ongoing with former patients. <br><br>  It is easy to prove that I have nothing to do with it.  But still, I always felt bad at the thought of that code. <br><br>  Soon after that dinner, I quit. <br><br>  As developers, often we are one of the last defenders against potentially dangerous and immoral practices. <br><br>  We are approaching the time when the programs will be able to control the machine that takes your family to a football training session.  There is already an AI that helps doctors diagnose a disease.  It is easy to imagine how he will soon recommend recipes. <br><br>  The more programs continue to capture every aspect of our lives, the more important it will be for us to take a firm stand and make sure that our ethics are always present in our code. <br><br>  From that day on, I always try to think twice about the impact of my code before I start writing it.  I hope that you will do the same. <br><br>  <i>Translation: Olga Chernopitskaya</i> <br><br><h2>  Read more </h2><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/315642/">Alistair Coburn: Team Development and Agile</a> <br><br>  <em><font color="#999999">Publication support is the <a href="https://www.edsd.com/">Edison</a> company, which develops <a href="https://www.edsd.ru/videozapis-v-bolnichnoj-operacionnoj-s-vozmozhnostyu-obsuzhdeniya-na-forume">a video surveillance software package in the operating room</a> , and also designs <a href="https://www.edsd.ru/vstroennoe-programmnoe-obespechenie-dlya-sterilizatora-medicinskih-izdelij">software for sterilizing medical devices</a> .</font></em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315668/</a></p>
