Before the launch of our weather probe with video cameras on board for a live broadcast to the ground, about which we have already written ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/4glaza/blog/122905/">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/4glaza/blog/120207/">here</a> ), less than a month remains.  It's time to tell you how the preparations are going. <br><br>  This post consists of three parts: <br><ul><li>  <b>"The final design of the probe"</b> on the assembly of the probe, </li><li>  <b>"Results of the contest of ideas"</b> about the winners, </li><li>  <b>"Solving legal issues"</b> on obtaining permission to launch. </li></ul><br>  Before you go to the main part of this publication, we inform you about the date, time and place of launch, to which everyone is welcome, whom we ask to be <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/zond/">registered</a> .

The body will have a rectangular shape (just because it's easier).  Although there were many different interesting proposals in form, especially rounded (for example, on the principle of a golf ball).  Vladimir, one of the most active participants in the competition, has a very interesting idea about the structure of the gondola.  He proposes to use 2 balls with a diameter of 20 and 50 cm, and further along the long, interesting <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/zond/konkurs/">text</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50a/18a/eec/50a18aeec12084c92718a839e11d9ce1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside will be: <br><br>  2 cameras <a href="http://gopro.com/cameras/hd-hero-naked-camera/">HD Hero GoPro</a> with a large viewing angle - one pointing down, the other sideways.  As practice has shown, a very reliable model.  Materials from these cameras will form the basis of the video report on the launch. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/949/843/9b7/9498439b7f3a76bc5c3b7fcfac80a308.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A camera from an <a href="http://www.parkflyer.ru/product/101579/">FPV system</a> that is likely to be pointing down.  We wrote about the system itself in a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/4glaza/blog/122905/">previous</a> publication.  It is from this camera that the signal will be transmitted to the ground and for live-feed to the Internet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58b/ac3/4d2/58bac34d2508baec13846516b3e753b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://rsgps.ru/node/106">GlobalSat GPS tracker</a> to receive GPS data from a great height (we are primarily interested in the location and direction of the device). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bb/d4f/b88/2bbd4fb8867da88f9fe90373ad5c5e19.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  GPS-GSM tracker for reliable reception of GPS data at a low altitude (to know where to look for it). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf1/dfc/273/cf1dfc273e567c1e2d779a60640e57c9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Video Transmitter from FPV-system.  Antenna which will be directed strictly down. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84b/8e6/753/84b8e67535f9806a6572e968fcd71961.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.splav.ru/goodsdetail.aspx%3Fgid%3D2008-12-09%2B15%253A22%253A55.000193">Teploid 6</a> to protect the electronics from low temperatures and a lithium-ion battery to power the video transmitter. <br><br>  The total weight should be about 900 grams.  The gondola itself will be attached to the meteorological probe by several lines (we did not dare for a long time, then we decided that several lines were a good idea after all).  All openings and gaps will be sealed with sealant for insulation.  Since we will most likely use the shell of a specialized weather probe, which will have a smooth ascent and descent, there is no need to shoot a burst ball.  We do this for extra security. <br><br>  On the ground, a directional antenna <a href="http://gsm-gate.ru/product/gsm-antenna-best-akl-900-16db/">AKL-900</a> will be connected to the video signal receiver, which we will send in accordance with the GPS data from the GPS-GPRS tracker.  With a gain of 16-18 dB, we expect that the signal will be maintained at a distance of up to 8 km, i.e.  Online mode will last much longer (hooray!). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/86858/%3Fhead%3D1%26from%3Dz_market_spb">Pinnacle Systems Dazzle Video Creator Platinum</a> will transmit video to the Internet from our site using a USB video capture card. <br><br><h2>  Results of the competition of ideas </h2><br>  The idea was to make the launch of the probe collective and to draw bright heads of modernity to the project, so that they would come up with solutions that we would not have thought of. <br><br>  We received many interesting proposals that were taken into account when creating the final project of the probe.  Very detailed descriptions were accompanied by diligent illustrations, such as those below.  To be honest, we did not expect such professional participants. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fc70f691/70cb3a75/06ee4feb/02825db9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a23/35f/136/a2335f136875ba1058cc15c2a08a874e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is a pity that we can not use all the suitable ideas that have been proposed.  Some are too costly, some are too laborious, and some simply require very capable hands and a lot of experience, which we doubt in our case. <br><br>  So, the contest winners were 3 participants: <br><br><ul><li>  Vladimir (Proposals <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/zond/konkurs/"># 27</a> , <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/zond/konkurs/"># 26</a> , <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/zond/konkurs/p6/"># 24</a> ), who receives <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/products/bino_bresser_1440842/">BRESSER Corvette</a> binoculars </li><li>  Piter Ring (offer <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/zond/konkurs/p4/">‚Ññ14</a> ), which receives binoculars <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/products/bino_levenhuk_210_10_50/">LEVENHUK Bino</a> </li><li>  ZloAlien (offers <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/zond/konkurs/">‚Ññ25</a> , <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/zond/konkurs/p6/">‚Ññ23</a> , <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/zond/konkurs/p5/">‚Ññ20</a> , <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/zond/konkurs/p5/">‚Ññ18</a> ), which is awarded a certificate in the amount of 5000 rubles.  from our partner <a href="http://www.shumgam.com/">"Shumgam"</a> and a 10% discount on all products of <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/">the Four Eyes</a> store </li></ul><br>  It goes without saying that all winners will have the opportunity to take part in the launch of the probe, cutting the cable that will hold the device until take-off. <br><br>  It is worth reading the work of these participants.  Each of them is a great example of design thinking (some sent additions several times, such as, for example, a ZloAlien participant).  Particularly pleased with the epilogue party Piter Ring: <br><br><blockquote>  Finally, I want to add a spoon or two pessimism.  Two months for all this may not be enough.  Payback from this venture do not wait.  At best, you are lucky enough to reduce your costs by attracting sponsors.  Well, when your faces will be printed in the ‚ÄúMoscow Komsomol‚Äù do not forget to mention my person (you do not care, but I am pleased).  And, of course, when you are being interrogated at the Lubyanka, then you certainly should not remember me. </blockquote><br><br><h2>  Legal issues </h2><br>  We were very pleasantly surprised at how well we were met in all the institutions to which we addressed.  Actually, they were not so much.  We started from the main thing - the Moscow Center for Automated Air Traffic Control (hereinafter - <a href="http://www.atcm.ru/">ATC</a> ).  They didn‚Äôt argue with us, but talked very nicely each time, explaining and helping with advice.  Very nice impression left.  That would be all government agencies so! <br><br>  Initially, the idea was to launch a probe within Moscow, or very close.  But in the Department of Internal Affairs we were told how difficult it is to organize this (users of Habr also did not forget to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/4glaza/blog/120207/">remind</a> us about this, for which they are very thankful).  It turns out that we are sharing our experience in order to hold such events in Moscow or even near Moscow, you need to get permission from the following authorities: Air Traffic Control, Transport Administration under the Government of Moscow, General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, 4. 4, FSB and FSU.  You need to send official requests and wait for a response a month.  In this case, the sequence is not entirely clear.  We got scared of so many letters, and we began to look for an alternative solution.  It turned out to be the city of Schelkovo, 20 km from Moscow, where permission must be obtained only from the Department of Internal Affairs and Chkalovsky Airport.  In general, and safer, and this is important. <br><br>  So, DIY on a legal issue for those who want to repeat this, on the example of our case: <br><ol><li>  Regardless of where the probe is launched, it is necessary to coordinate the launch with the local government agencies responsible for air traffic control.  There is always a chance that the structure will intersect with something (for example, with an airplane).  Results may be unpredictable. </li><li>  It is necessary to have a legal entity that will receive permission and be responsible for the launch and its consequences, if any. </li><li>  It is necessary in advance (in our case, we do this in a month) to write a letter of request (to whom and in what form you will be prompted in the above-mentioned structures) indicating the place, time and coordinates. </li><li>  Care must be taken to ensure the safety of the structure and, if necessary, to prove its safety before obtaining a permit. </li><li>  Obviously: you need to adhere to the approved launch time. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124617/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124617/</a></p>
