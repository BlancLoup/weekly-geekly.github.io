  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Are you an expert in any one IT-field or a universal who deals with everything? I'm from the second category ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This text is dedicated to all <s>non-professionals in any one area of</s> IT-universals. <br>  The story is this: I work in a pretty good position (head of IT-department) and even have <s>three or</s> several people in submission.  The company itself is not IT oriented.  We are engaged in retail, wholesale and online sales.  And also we are the service center of several famous brands.  The company has several web resources, including several online stores, a couple of which have a very good turnover.  It is with this whole household that I have to refill.  Plus advertising, printing, banners, seo, etc.  My salary is fine with me too.  Say, much higher than the average for St. Petersburg.  At the moment, everything in my job suits me except for one thing: lack of experience in a profile company (in a profile environment). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This topic was inspired by this topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/11462/">habrahabr.ru/qa/11462</a> , in which very precise words were said in one of the comments.  Words that make you think and look at your position from the other side.  In short, the meaning is approximately as follows: in your company you are a king and a god.  You are the smartest, the most advanced, the most IT.  But as soon as you do not need your company (for example, it closes), you will not need anyone.  In profile companies are interested in your development.  In specialized firms, working in a team of specialists, you develop faster and more efficiently as a professional.  And in a non-core organization, management may not even go into details about what you do and how, the main thing is to work.  Why am I projecting this situation on myself?  Because I began my journey with a sort of universal.  Riveted sites: he designed himself, he installed himself, he programmed himself.  And in principle, this and continue to do to this day, for several years.  I have created web projects of our company.  As for me, they constantly develop, support and advance.  At the same time he was engaged in printing, developing banners, seo, etc.  Then, when there was not enough hands on everything, I asked the management to hire an assistant.  So a seo optimizer and content manager appeared in the company.  Over time, another man came, etc.  I, in turn, sort of became their leader.  He became more engaged in programming (php) and less everything else.  Although as before I do the design, I make up.  Learned and started using jQuery.  Carried away by web analytics, usability and testing.  For the second year I have been struggling with questions of increasing conversion, etc. I study and apply adaptive design, etc.  Those.  I try to absorb new trends and technologies.  I go to seminars.  In short, I continue to pump some of my skills, including my initial skills: design, programming, layout, etc.  Even flash drives can do and write Action Script.  But I do not develop purposefully in any one direction.  This chance has long been missed.  If a few years ago I would have decided to become a programmer or a designer, then it might be now that this would be worthwhile.  But that did not happen.  I continued to develop as a wagon. <br><br>  Still as a freelancer, I continue to rivet sites on my engine, my layout, my design.  Let's say I can do a little bit of everything.  But the pros will look at my php code and say ‚Äúgovnokod‚Äù.  A professional designer will look at my design and say ‚Äúmediocre level‚Äù (although, as it seems to me, even as many admit, some works are very much nothing).  An experienced typesetter will look at the layout and say "layout like a clean, but not ideal", etc. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      And so I began to wonder, what if I want to change jobs or God forbid my company wants to part with me for any reason.  Can I find a job?  And not so that it was a low-paid work of a novice web designer or php-programmer.  My age, marital status and current salary will not allow me to go down to this level again.  So how to be that?  If you go to hh.ru and enter in the search query ‚Äúit‚Äôs an expert‚Äù, ‚Äúweb developer‚Äù, ‚Äúweb designer‚Äù, ‚Äúweb master‚Äù, etc., then you are issued mainly profile vacancies, such as ‚Äúrequires Senior Php Developer‚Äù or "interface designer" (for a good salary, of course, highly qualified specialists).  And who am I?  A ‚Äúcool wagon‚Äù that nobody really needs in such a modification? <br><br>  How to be?  Again, look for a company that is engaged in FIG know what and she needs a "webmaster" who will support her websites?  Yes such <br>  There are firms, but they probably don‚Äôt need such an expert who needs to pay a lot (and my requests, according to my current salary, are now quite large).  I also came to my company in my time for a salary 2.5 times less than it is now and it grew only after I really did a lot of things, developed it and started to generate income.  I‚Äôm badly imagining a company that could hire a specialist like me, right away for a normal salary, because, as a rule, ‚Äúworking on the company's websites‚Äù is a position for students, novice workers.  And if you need a head of IT-department, then immediately stands in the requirements: team management experience (from 10 people), excellent knowledge of the 1c accounting system in order to develop the company's workflow system and accounting (just as a private example), ability to work in a team ( with bug trackers, version control systems, GIT, etc.).  Regarding teamwork, this is generally my own particular pain.  I often see in vacancies the requirement ‚Äúteamwork experience‚Äù, ‚ÄúSVN‚Äù, bug trackers, etc.  I, due to the fact that I work in a non-core IT company, unfortunately, all this has passed.  Programming languages, graphics packages, principles, trends, technology, etc.  - all this can be studied in my situation.  But to study the principles of teamwork, on large projects - this is not given in my situation.  Or I just do not know how to do it. <br><br>  I know, on Habr√© many people of different ages, different positions, different specialties, different levels of professionalism, etc.  So I want to contact you: tell me, based on my experience, how can I be, what to do.  Has anyone been in a similar situation.  In vain or not in vain do I panic, i.e.  Do people in the market need such specifics?  I know that there will be tips, such as "change your place of work, go to the profile office, go to the salary increase, in the future it will pay off."  I must say at once that there are reasons for me not to do this.  At least for now. <br>  Does anyone need specialists of this kind?  Or did I make a mistake at the time and needed to develop in one area? <br>  Or maybe it's not too late?  Need to open hh, see there that one of the most sought-after specialties is a Java programmer and start learning how to program a Java programmer? <br><br>  PS For God's sake, do not consider that crying or vice versa PR.  Although, rather, of course I am crying.  Not a very good mood and assessment of their lives and activities led to the writing of such a text.  In the hope that the comments (if they will) will become a kind of impetus for the adoption of any further decisions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188514/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188514/</a></p>
