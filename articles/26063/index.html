I decided to write the 2nd part, because there was a whole battle.  On the same day after the beginning of the voting (May 20), he came to the school and was extremely dissatisfied.  He put everyone on notice, the teacher sent 5 messages at recess, at home his parents sent two.  Then they phoned the teacher, she told them how it was.  A couple of days later we got something like this: <a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúWe are not to blame, just the office that made the site wrote this voting system, and therefore we can‚Äôt do anything.  It seems that someone voted more than once a day and the system has blocked the site.  But you do not worry!  the jury will evaluate the work, not the vote.  " <i>(Very strange - the voices were raised, then - they went down ... The cunning system, it seems mechanical ...)</i> What we were asked to send the ip list, they are still sending, apparently they have not seen it themselves.  It turned out that they did not expect this and thought it was a script.  As a result, I received 2.5k votes back today, but it was impossible to vote for 3 days.  How they all are well tested and brought to perfection!  We have nothing to do with it and in general the site is not ours ;-) But microsoft is one of the sponsors :-) and in general this is a competition for network security :-) <br>  In general, laughter through tears.  And how can you treat such people? <br><br>  PS If you notice something beautiful in my design - <a href="http://www.webmaster2008.net/webmaster/Vota.aspx%3FFiltro%3D-1:-1:-1%26EquipaId%3D24">vote</a> , please :-) I do not pretend to a good design, but in the opinion of others - this is the only something human.  THOSE.  I decided to give info for those who do not know anything - I made 4 video dialogs about antiviruses, proxies, parental controls and all sorts of basic things like firewall and msconfig-autorun in the first part, some basic text information with a link to the full ones leading to Microsoft's help site in the second part and the links that I had to put on the competition - in the third part.  The rest of the polls text infa sometimes in the most unreadable form.  Oh yeah, because  I did not have time to mark it up correctly for ie6 - I decided to make a stub - ‚ÄúDo you want to know about the sew in the network, and do not know that ie6 came out 10 years ago, full of holes through which viruses can get?  Update it immediately and you will be more secure ‚Äùand download link ie7.  (on whist in ff in the vote, where 2 frames - the site is not visible, in IE 7 - it is visible. These are the merits of their super-duper layout designers. Despite the mega-designers, advanced progers and awesome support, pushing everything onto the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù .. .) <a href="http://www.webmaster2008.net/webmaster/trabalhosConcurso.aspx">All works</a> (Click pesquizar) <br>  <a href="http://www.webmaster2008.net/webmaster/Vota.aspx%3FFiltro%3D-1:-1:-1%26EquipaId%3D24">If you like, you can vote for mine,</a> if something else liked more - look at all the works.  Anyone can vote.  The main thing is not to break the superfood system.  And last time a server fell stupidly ... </div>
