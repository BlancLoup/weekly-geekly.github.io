In the second part of this material, we continue to talk about the benefits of a microcopy, but by the example of cases. <br><br>  <b>Case 2 - how <a href="http://yoast.com/">did Yoast.Com</a> create an order template they could be proud of?</b> <br><br>  While the microcopy alone will not be able to increase conversion by 11, 3%, in this case, it definitely plays a key role. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Before:</b>

However, it is not necessary to assume that all these changes are random.  The phrase ‚Äúno extra cost‚Äù was added for the reason that hidden costs are one of the most important reasons why people refuse to buy in the basket. <br><br>  Other minor changes, such as the buy progress display box and button design, were made to emphasize the urge to move forward ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b2/cf4/238/4b2cf4238bce9225c0c533e0c8cf8433.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ea/2f6/617/5ea2f66170c7c799ab19553aa93fe7c5.jpg"><br><br>  ... and the built-in confirmation of the form also provided a positive feedback - a small green check mark that appears immediately after the user has finished entering data, provided confidence that he has done everything correctly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54a/fc8/084/54afc8084a640f3319bd7cfeefddd1ea.jpg"><br><br>  Overall, these and some other small changes have helped the Yoast website increase the number of successful deals by 30%. <br><br>  <b>Case 3 - Insound received more visitors by adding an ordering template in just two words.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/372/794/eb9/372794eb9307e21c720e0d6ba80d893b.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://blog.optimizely.com/2013/10/02/ecommerce-checkout-funnel-test-insound/"><i>source image</i></a> <br><br>  In 2012, <a href="http://www.insound.com/">Insound</a> updated the ordering template, focusing primarily on users who came to the site from mobile phones and tablets.  It was a truly innovative approach. <br><br>  Unfortunately, innovation has led to a decrease in conversion.  A large marketing campaign was approaching, so Insound could not afford to fall. <br>  The <a href="http://clearhead.me/">Clearhead</a> optimization <a href="http://clearhead.me/">company</a> , like Insound, suspected that the ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù button after each user step caused confusion and, ultimately, the client did not reach the payment / delivery information page. <br><br>  So, they tested three versions of the text on the button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/366/6ba/bc6/3666babc62756d5d4cf254305afc5aef.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the ‚Äúalmost all‚Äù button showed the highest efficiency, a simpler option ‚Äúcheck order‚Äù provided 39.4% of the transitions to the next page, and now more than half of users clicked on the next page before placing an order. <br><br>  Insound really deserved praise, because they achieved additional income not from increasing sales or conducting a separate marketing campaign, but due to the fact that they made the input fields much more convenient than before. <br><br>  <b>Case 4 - 11% increase in mortgage lead generation</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.conversionvoodoo.com/">Conversion Voodoo</a> conducted a mortgage optimization campaign, which ultimately contributed to an increase in completed applications from their site by 37%. <br><br>  The main change was the placement of a simple field on the main page of their site.  Users were asked to click on the check mark and enter their name and email address in order to start the refinancing process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/098/b15/20b/098b1520b979432575b4304d9ff94017.jpg"><br><br>  If you have never tried to leave a mortgage application, you probably know how unpleasant the filing process is. <br><br>  As a rule, it includes a 20-minute process of filling out a form that includes a million questions about where you lived, how much you earn, how much money is spent on paying taxes, etc. <br><br>  Thus, by clicking on the checkbox on the main page, users confirm their intention to get the best conditions.  This formulation added 11% to the number of completed forms. <br><br>  <b>Try it: a microcopy in the site search bar</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c4/1c8/79d/3c41c879d6355e791b83c4e109e60360.jpg"><br><br>  Exploring 27 different sites, representatives of the Branded 3 marketing agency found that visitors using search on the site perform a target action 2-3 times more often than those who do not use it. <br><br>  If your site fits this case (if your GA is correctly configured, you can check it out by looking <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/web/provision%3Fet%3D%26authuser%3D">here</a> ), then why offer the visitor standard phrases like ‚Äúenter search words‚Äù or ‚Äúarticle number‚Äù? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea4/f14/b04/ea4f14b04efc9146d549f9f42e2ca765.jpg"><br><br>  Why not use the most popular search queries or categories, and not fill in the search bar in advance, according to this data? <br><br>  These, for example, could be on <a href="http://ikea.com/">Ikea.com</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/642/ae2/5b7/642ae25b7aa6e475f463ac785bac57b2.jpg"><br><br>  The use of real data helps to speed up the buying process for those visitors who came to the site with the serious intention to purchase products from the categories you mentioned. <br><br>  An interesting solution on the site <a href="http://kinopoisk.ru/">kinopoisk.ru</a> .  Visitors are given freedom of action, but for doubters there is a section ‚ÄúWhat are they looking for?‚Äù Where you can see trends.  And there is even ‚Äúroulette‚Äù - the ‚Äúrandom‚Äù movie button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba9/7f6/20c/ba97f620cb4bd3a1a4f9d79683bf2528.jpg"><br><br>  Eric Curtis - Web Analytics Director at Tastebook.com conducted a study on how to convert to registration depending on the phrase in the search bar on the site.  At the same time, he repeated the keyword in Google Adwords with a phrase in the search bar.  As a result, a direct relationship was revealed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d80/e40/24e/d80e4024e4ffd4f700cf6cd288ca3246.jpg"><br><br>  Their highest achievement, ‚Äúthe creation of a cookbook,‚Äù also constitutes the main element of navigation, which leads me to believe that such seemingly minor improvements lead to a significant improvement in conversion. <br><br>  <b>Using a microcopy to answer the question "oh, why do you need this ?!"</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://baymard.com/blog/checkout-experience-seemingly-unnecessary-information">In a usability study conducted by the Baymard Institute in 2012</a> , it was found that customers feel as if they are being <a href="http://baymard.com/blog/checkout-experience-seemingly-unnecessary-information">intruded</a> into their privacy without asking if they are asked to provide personal information (for example, a phone number) without explaining why. . <br><br>  At some specific point, each user expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that he was asked to provide too much personal information. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIn the course of user testing at Apple.com, one of the subjects refused to give her phone number, shouting with alarm:‚Äú Listen, why should they have my phone number?</i>  <i>Why do they need it?</i>  <i>They do not need it at all! ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  An interesting fact: users began to treat this much more tolerantly when the reason for which this information was needed was indicated near the input form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84f/52f/e5b/84f52fe5b65020f45984c76807ec0309.jpg"><br><br>  You must clearly explain to the client why you need this or that information about him, this will nullify all possible differences. <br><br>  In particular, for new customers, some simple questions (for example, about delivery) may become decisive during the checkout process. <br><br>  <b>Summing up</b> <br><br>  Honestly, you can talk about a microcopy for a very long time, because you can find it everywhere - both on the pages with prices, and in security messages, and even in tiny reminders in the order form. <br><br>  But what I would like to know is: how do you think, where exactly these short phrases will have the greatest impact on your site? <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://conversionxl.com/microcopy/%3Fhvid%3D30ks7R">http://conversionxl.com/microcopy/?hvid=30ks7R</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230849/</a></p>
