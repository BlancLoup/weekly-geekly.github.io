  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is Wi-Fi Beacon an Alternative to QR Codes?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/959/83d/efe/95983defe4bc3a019fdbd75f4e84a356.png" align="right">  It is indisputable (at least for small readers) that in the absolute majority of cases digital technologies are much more convenient than analog ones - they provide an order of magnitude more possibilities.  Therefore, it is useful and interesting a priori to translate any technology into electronic form.  But besides this, it is interesting to try to make digital technology even more digital. <br>  In this post, a new technology of fast access to information from mobile devices is proposed, which develops the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa well-known QR-code, using the technology that is equally familiar to everyone - Wi-Fi. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What good is a QR code to describe is not required - this is a great invention, used by millions of people from different countries of the world, and having hundreds, if not thousands of applications - from packaging goods to gravestones in cemeteries.  But, at the same time, the QR code has its drawbacks.  Namely, the codes themselves, that is, their images, are analog, which means that for their use it is necessary to digitize, having photographed a mobile device.  And in many cases it doesn‚Äôt cause any problems - it‚Äôs elementary to ‚Äúremove‚Äù the code from an outdoor advertisement for a concert or packaging in a store to go to the website of the ticket seller or manufacturer of goods.  And in such cases QR is irreplaceable. <br><br>  But, first, there are situations when additional information is needed, moreover, it is here and now, but placing a QR link on it is completely inappropriate. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dea/056/ef8/dea056ef807e04b9190b3f9c768754e3.png" align="left">  For example, in museums or theaters.  In addition, in many places it is simply forbidden or not to take photographs, especially with a flash, and it will most likely be needed - after all, not all public places are brightly lit.  And even if there are no prohibitions and contraindications to photography, not everyone wants to look like a tourist or a blogger who photographs everything around. <br>  In addition, if information from a QR code is necessary for a group of people (for example, access to a menu page in a food court cafe or train schedule at a train station), then a queue will inevitably form a line for shooting, in order to avoid which you will have to hang a lot of codes.  And even if you go for it (for example, order tile for walls with a QR pattern), then the main problem becomes obvious, the main problem is the static nature of the QR code.  Any change to the encoded information entails a reprint of the codes (and in the hypothetical case above, repair with tile re-routing).  And if the change of information occurs hourly, then ... you know, the QR code requires replacement with another technology.  (Although there is still an option to hang the walls with monitors or tablets on which to show the dynamically changing code, but this solution can not be called either cheap or aesthetic. <br><br><h4>  RadioBeacon - Green Lighthouse. </h4><br>  At the same time, now, at least in large Russian cities, it is difficult to find a common area - a train station, a shopping center, a bank, a cafe, not equipped with at least one point of wireless Internet access - Wi-Fi.  Such points are far from always free, they are often intended only for official use, but for our purposes this does not matter, as the proposed technology involves the use of existing Wi-Fi points for purposes other than the direct purpose of accessing the network (although this is not excluded) , and as Beacons.  Green Beacons - the traditional color indicator steady wireless connection.

      <b>The essence of the proposal is simple</b> : <br><br>  Service providers (owners of hotspots) - <br><ol><li>  Using the simplest application, connect any Wi-Fi point by its MAC address with a link to an electronic portal containing information necessary for visitors of the place where this access point is installed (for example, ‚Äúcafe menu‚Äù, ‚Äúcheck-in at the entrance queue‚Äù, ‚ÄúInformation about goods‚Äù and tp), or directly with a piece of text (by the way, the text can be of any volume, unlike a QR code). </li><li>  Report this to visitors through a special character - a poster or sticker. </li></ol><br><br>  Consumer services - <ol><li>  Install a free client application on your Wi-Fi-enabled device that scans Wi-Fi access points, determines which point has the strongest signal ‚Äî that is, the closest one, and then requests (from the server database of the application where all Wi-Fi registration by MAC address) URL associated with this point, or associated text, then opens this address in the browser, or displays the text in the editor. </li><li>  After seeing the special ‚ÄúRadioMayachka‚Äù symbol, launch the application and go closer to the beacon, or send your device (simply reach out with the phone / tablet in the right direction) to get the necessary information.  As a result, an illusion is created for the consumer that your gadget itself knows which page to open \ what information to show when in a certain point in space. </li></ol><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a43/50e/cca/a4350ecca39b68b1e7d6bb2b59238cbb.png"><br><br>  We emphasize once again that it is not necessary (although possible) that the Internet access for displaying the page or transmitting the associated text is carried out using this hotspot.  <b>In this case, the Wi-Fi access point is simply a beacon that defines the context of the information, but a real connection to it is not required at all.</b>  That is, the access point (the minimum price for which, by the way, does not exceed $ 20) can be nowhere else, except for the electrical outlet is not connected and not even configured!  If the point works for its intended purpose - ‚Äúdistributes the Internet‚Äù, then its use as a radio beacon does not cause any damage to the quality of communication, does not threaten security, and does not carry other risks. <br><br>  And what if you use for these purposes not a Wi-Fi access point, and NFC?  - because then the Internet connection is not required.  Yes, it is possible and so (and probably so somewhere already being done and will be done).  But, firstly, the acquisition of an NFC terminal is more expensive than a Wi-Fi router (which, moreover, is already available in 99% of cases), and secondly, NFC in devices is almost two orders of magnitude less frequent than Wi-Fi, and most importantly, to come close to the terminal to wait, even just a minute, until others want to leave it, as will happen in the case of NFC, is much more unpleasant than not going and not waiting for Wi-Fi beacons.  This becomes especially obvious in the case of a train station or an airport, where you have to go with your luggage, or groups of tourists in a museum, where you have to wait for your turn for a long time. <br><br><h4>  RadioBecon - practice. </h4><br>  To test the viability of the idea, a free Android application, available on GooglePlay - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.hoopoe.android.radiobeacon%26feature%3Dsearch_result">RadioBeacon</a> , as well as the corresponding server part, was created without advertising or other hidden sources of monetization.  The application is at the same time both a client receiving a beacon signal, and it makes it possible to easily associate any Wi-Fi access point that happened to be near you with an arbitrary web address. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3be/028/a9b/3be028a9b410b8a97fcfcb9fd67bb45e.png"></div><br>  <i>Password - protection against pranksters who want to connect the access point of your serious company with a dating site</i> <br><br><blockquote>  If you happen to be in the city of Portland (Portland, USA, Oregon), then you can try this program in action, namely to make an excellent tour of the city, guided by Radio beacons. <br>  All you need is a gadget with an Android system, Internet access, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.hoopoe.android.radiobeacon%26feature%3Dsearch_result">RadioBeacon</a> .  The program will be used to detect web pages related to the places you visit.  Keep in mind that you will most likely have to search for a specific place with which the page is connected before RadioBeacon can open it: for example, enter or exit, or go around a building or point the phone in a certain direction while pressing beacon button. <br><br>  On this tour you will enjoy Portland and follow these steps: <br>  1. Start <a href="http://www.lloydcenter.com/directions">from here</a> , get to the very "heart" of this place (hint: it is cold as ice), and the Radio Beacon will show you the next step. <br>  2. This step will help you cross the river and point the way forward. <br>  3. Walk and look for beacons.  When you find them, they will lead you further. <br>  4. Enjoy this place, do not forget to find the lighthouse and go where it indicates - you have an unexpected meeting. <br>  5. Stand in front of her and look at her across the street - and the radio beacon will tell you about her. <br><br>  Have a nice trip! </blockquote><br><br>  Those who read the text from the very beginning up to this point are most likely wondering how the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãradio beacons has to do with Intel‚Äôs blog, and of Intel itself.  The answer is simple: the idea belongs to an Intel employee in Russia, Stanislav Bratanov. <br><br>  According to the rules of Intel, employees are absolutely not prohibited (and even recommended) in their free time from the main work to invent new concepts in the IT world and implement them in their own non-Intel programs.  The only requirements are that it does not interfere with the main work, does not conflict with the interests of Intel and does not hide from management. <br>  In this case, all these requirements are unconditionally met.  By the way, now you understand why RadioBecon is an absolutely non-commercial product - Intel provides its employees with a decent competitive salary, so the question of earnings is not worth it, just as the author doesn‚Äôt talk about serious development of the idea - otherwise it will contradict the first paragraph. Intel requirements. <br><br>  So why was this post written, and what would I like to receive from readers? <br><ul><li>  Use this technology in general and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.hoopoe.android.radiobeacon%26feature%3Dsearch_result">RadioBeacon</a> in particular in your company, invent various new applications for it. </li><li>  Leave your opinion about the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãRadio Beacons in the comments to this post or contact <a href="">Stanislav</a> </li><li>  If you want to port RadioBeacon to MacOS, Windows Phone or another platform, then the author is ready to provide the interface and logo free of charge, all you need is a desire to popularize the technology. </li></ul><br><br>  Additional information about Radio Beacons is available in English <a href="http://www.hoopoesnest.com/beacon/beacon-details.htm">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201112/</a></p>
