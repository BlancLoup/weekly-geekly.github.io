But there was enough theory and description of experience in this direction. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The three most useful links with descriptions of strategies for choosing devices for testing are located at the end of the article. <br><br>  All the strategies described there can be reduced to a general theory, concluded in the following three points: <br><ol><li>  Use existing statistics (it is important to use current devices). </li><li>  Take into account the parameters and characteristics of devices. <br>  Parameters that can be taken into account: <br><ul><li>  Screen size </li><li>  PPI (pixels per inch) </li><li>  screen resolution </li><li>  Android version </li><li>  speed (CPU, RAM) </li><li>  features of the design, such as the type of data entry (keyboard, touch, trackball, etc.), the presence of cameras ... </li><li>  browser </li><li>  manufacturer </li><li>  supported services (geolocation) </li><li>  price </li></ul></li><li>  Consider budget </li></ol>

      Further, depending on the project, everyone chooses for himself the determining factors or their combinations. <br><br>  The parameters that almost all bloggers take into account are Android version, PPI and screen resolution.  For web-projects, the browser is important along with the listed parameters.  For heavy native applications, speed is equally important ... and so on ... <br><br>  The most logical and simplest strategy seemed to me the theory of <b>popular and cheap</b> (popular and cheap). <br><br><h4>  Practice.  Stage 1: </h4><br>  Armed with knowledge, I proceeded to action. <br>  The project, for which the obtained knowledge was applied, is used by approximately 1000 models of mobile devices every day more than 2 million times.  And there were statistics on the number of visits for each device. <br><br>  <b>The stage of collecting data</b> on devices turned out to be the most time-consuming.  I collected information on the Internet about 123 popular devices, complementing the document with Android, CPU, screen sizes, resolutions and PPI for each device.  This work took about a week. <br><br>  It turned out that 123 out of 1000 devices cover 80% of visits, and I decided to stop there. <br><br>  <b>The stage of data analysis</b> was the most interesting.  Having noted the already existing devices (there were 7 of them) for testing in the table, I proceeded with the groupings on various parameters. <br><br>  <b>The grouping by major.minor of the Android version</b> showed that all groups from 4.2 to 2.2 (76% of visits) are covered for testing, and only devices with Android 2.1 (2.95% of visits) and 1.x (0.28% of visits) are not covered.  In general, the result is not bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a1/b0e/f4c/8a1b0ef4c1e07907c2ce0e8f5391c63c.png"><br><br>  <b>A resolution analysis</b> showed that the second most popular resolution was 480x320, with 18.61% of visits never checked.  At the same time, the most popular group with a resolution of 800x480 (27.56%) is covered with 3 devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/065/e63/032/065e63032a8c9034ec5267c85b91ec32.png"><br><br>  <b>Analysis of Android versions and screen resolutions</b> gave more interesting results.  The three most popular groups are 2.3 and 800x480 (15.30%), 2.3 and 480x320 (11.83%), 4.1 and 1280x720 (10.75%) are not covered at all.  In this case, the total coverage of a set of devices for testing was only 8% of visits. <br><br>  As a result, a number of proposals were put forward that could significantly increase the coverage of visits on the basic parameters of devices. <br><br>  On this my research in this area stopped. <br><br><h4>  Six months later ... </h4><br>  I recently returned to this issue while working on a new project.  To be honest, the prospect of collecting information about devices did not please me. <br><br>  One colleague saved me a lot of time by sharing the link <a href="http://choosedevice.com/">choosedevice.com</a> .  This turned out to be a complete automated solution.  In this project, information has already been collected on more than 200 devices, but only on 4 parameters: api level (os version), screen size, PPI and screen resolution.  It is clear that this project is still young and is currently in beta testing. <br><br><h4>  Actions.  Stage 2: </h4><br>  This is the experience gained when working with this service: <br><br><ol><li>  I went to the site using my google account. </li><li>  Noted devices used for new project. </li><li>  Made the export of mobile devices from google analytics. </li><li>  Loaded this statistics in choosedevice. </li></ol><br>  All this took 10 minutes, and I received general statistics on mobile devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/129/d78/905/129d7890555ce82cd10e24fe8cface26.png"><br><br>  Next, I used the search bar to group devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e5/1f2/529/9e51f2529dd8418c18ac71dea43f85cf.png"><br><br>  The system calculated the coverage of user visits for the selected parameter and issued the recommended devices. <br><br>  <b>You can also group by two parameters.</b>  Below is the result of the ppi / resolution service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c04/b04/86c/c04b0486c15c794dde7415f39a1abf64.png"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion: </h4><br>  Android device really needs to be chosen wisely.  ChooseDevice helps to do this qualitatively. <br><br><h5>  Useful links: </h5><br>  <a href="http://stephanierieger.com/strategies-for-choosing-test-devices/">stephanierieger.com/strategies-for-choosing-test-devices</a> <br>  <a href="http://devblog.xing.com/qa/how-to-choose-the-right-mobile-test-devices/">devblog.xing.com/qa/how-to-choose-the-right-mobile-test-devices</a> <br>  <a href="http://mobilephonedevelopment.com/archives/1600">mobilephonedevelopment.com/archives/1600</a> <br><br><h5>  More useful links from google: </h5><br>  <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html">developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html</a> <br><br><h5>  ChooseDevice: </h5><br>  <a href="http://choosedevice.com/">choosedevice.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179531/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179531/</a></p>
