Today I decided to share an overview of a great stylish button phone. <br>  I just want to warn you that I will not repeat what I can find on the network.  I will tell it from the user who clearly knew the purpose of the purchase of this device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f7/b52/56f/5f7b5256fb34546ef6f8f639c138cf0d.jpg"><br><h6>  I have the same but black </h6><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Exactly a year ago, my next phone just rotted away after another hike.  According to personal statistics, the phone without protection from moisture is enough for 2-5 hikes.  And it's time to choose the next test subject.  At that moment I already understood that one card is not enough.  I wanted two.  But Google search gave me this miracle when the famous Korean giant, in which there were already three SIM cards.  Learning that there are phones even with three SIM cards, I began to look in this direction.  It turned out that there are no analogues, beside the Chinese ‚ÄúAla Nokla‚Äù, in which there are even 4 and 5 SIM cards.  But in them, I was frightened by the presence of the GSM module for each SIM card, that is, the radiation that was not very useful increased by 4-5 times.  And with 3 sim cards, they <s>did not find</s> such monsters. <br><br>  At that time, LG was the only company whose phones I hadn‚Äôt used in the last 10 years.  Because of this, I was a little afraid.  And I did not care about the issue of money or the quality of the phone, because even if he would have lived only a couple of months I would not be upset and would buy a new one.  The scarecrow was exactly what I had never used, not just phones, but generally devices from Skis.  I understood this only then.  Since he considered this company is not very "quality."

      Well, more or less the brand name and lack of analogues made its contribution, and in a couple of days it was in my hands.  Why a couple of days?  And because in the Ukrainian city of Zaporozhye, it was sold only in a few stores, and only by reservation. <br><br>  Let us turn to the review of the phone itself.  Characteristics are standard for phones 5-8 years old: <br><ul><li>  Support for multiple 3x SIM cards </li><li>  Dimensions 113.5 x 51 x 13 mm, 92 g </li><li>  Display TFT 2.2 "(176x220), 256 thousand colors </li><li>  1.3 megapixel camera, 1280 x 1024 pixels </li><li>  GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz standard - SIM1, SIM 2, SIM 3 </li><li>  Memory functions 19 MB internal memory </li><li>  Support for microSD memory cards up to 4 GB </li><li>  Organizer: To-do list, Notes, Calculator, Clock, World time Stopwatch, Alarm clock </li><li>  Call Management Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãDial, Auto Dial, Handsfree </li><li>  Call Forwarding, Hold, Call Waiting </li><li>  Entertainment: Media Player, Stereo FM Radio, Java </li><li>  Work with SMS, MMS, Email </li><li>  Internet GPRS WAP 2.0 </li><li>  Bluetooth wireless technology </li><li>  Power Li-ion battery 1500 mAh </li><li>  Package Contents: Phone LG A290, Rechargeable Battery, Charger, User Manual, Warranty Card </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c94/1fd/1e2/c941fd1e2360379bdfef4f482aa67427.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f70/a30/f43/f70a30f43fac645c08dc3662545924f6.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82f/5d7/831/82f5d7831700d02dd175fd0a30880f7b.jpg"><br>  I also take into account the peculiarities of cellular communication in Ukraine: We have only three major mobile operators.  One card was.  I bought another 2 by phone. As a result, I received unlimited calls to 2 operators without having to replenish the account, in principle, and the third one is charged but very cheap.  In the financial part, this was displayed in a very interesting way: for the year I replenished my account for about 100 hryvnas in the sum of 3 cards, although I replenished it with at least 30-50 hryvnias a month before.  As a result, a year later the device itself almost paid for itself. <br><br>  The second feature is the battery.  1500 mAh  And really scanty power consumption.  In the mode of active conversations I charge at least once in 8-10 days.  And if moderately / little is enough for 10-15 days.  It was a real happiness, because even cheap Nokia is not capable of this: parents just have several such devices, and they have to charge on average once a week. <br><br><h4>  Separately about the menu </h4><br>  Nothing extra.  Even in modern budget devices, the presence of items in the main menu makes eyes scatter.  There is only the most necessary.  Only 9 points.  Although I would have 2-3 more removed.  But they do not interfere. <br><br>  For the year he never zaglyuchil, frozen, etc.  After that, as it starts to blink and write "The battery is discharged" - quietly enough for a day of use. <br><br><h4>  About the quality of materials and assembly </h4><br>  Made well.  If it is good to attach to or sit on it, you can hear creaks or notice a slight backlash of the lid.  Plastic is so thin that I was at first afraid to even lay it down on the table.  Now I throw on all surfaces without thinking.  Thin, but durable and soft.  I wear naturally without a cover.  In jeans.  With keys, lighters, other phones, small change, etc.  How was black and stayed.  Only the upper half of the screen got stuck and became matte, which in no way affects its functionality. <br><br>  At the moment, he survived about 5 trips and a trip to the Carpathians on skis.  In nature, he spent about 2 months in a year: that is, he wore windbreakers in his breast pocket, in the top flap of a backpack and lay in a tent where he would fall.  Of the two months, half exactly spent in high humidity or even wet (condensation on its surface around the clock).  Works.  No problem.  After hiking at night, open it to a bed to dry it a little. <br><br><h4>  About the antenna </h4><br>  Three SIM cards, one GSM module.  That is, the polling frequency of the base station module is divided into three.  If a call / sms occurs, then naturally all attention goes to the appropriate card.  He catches everywhere an order of magnitude better than all the more expensive / cheap fellows.  I keep quiet about smartphones - they are not even worthy of being around him in terms of communication quality.  It catches in the mountains, forests, basements, concrete houses, and everywhere.  And everywhere you can talk.  In the mountains, where others took the phone and walked up the mountain 50-100 meters, I just lay in a tent and calmly spoke.  Smartphones with which I compare: Lumia 520, HTC One, Fly 401, Motorola Razor.  Ordinary telephones: at home, 5 1-2 sim samsungs and a house.  LG was the best in terms of communication and life expectancy from a single charge. <br><br><h4>  Minuses </h4><br>  After a couple of months, sometimes the ‚Äú4‚Äù button is pressed tightly, that is, you need to press down hard enough that it would work.  But given the operating conditions - I can not say that this is a manufacturer's problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/316/e68/adb/316e68adb203a02097bd8a93d2cb8b6b.jpg"><br><h6>  The quality of the screen is not a fountain, but more than enough for normal use. </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/300/426/fb5/300426fb5e79fd6effbb359b9c895a7a.jpg"><br><h6>  Wear screen worn anyhow </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a1/8e1/73e/2a18e173e35b08ebb1f4cd5d5797aa60.jpg"><br><h6>  The first sticker made almost immediately after purchase </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef4/e0d/846/ef4e0d8460c5a7b6470cd91038268a06.jpg"><br><h6>  Disassembled </h6><br>  Well, a flashlight.  Rescued a bunch of times.  Often even works as a nightlight, almost all night, because a friend does not like darkness .... <br><br><h4>  Regarding the use of 3 sim on one phone </h4><br>  No problems.  Everything is clearly visible and intuitive.  Switching a separate button on the sidebar. <br><br><h4>  About the sound </h4><br>  Volume and sound quality for more than this unit. <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  But comments. <br><br><h4>  That's all </h4><br>  I can say with confidence that the LG A290 is the best I've held in my hands since the days of the Nokia 6300. <br>  By the way, although in many stores they write ‚ÄúOut of production‚Äù, but you can easily buy it for reasonable enough money, which is equivalent to American crispy ones for only $ 60. <br><br>  I am happy to answer questions if I did not disclose any points in sufficient volume. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206212/</a></p>
