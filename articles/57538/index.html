      Even though it happened only a few weeks ago, it now seems that an eternity has passed since the trial of The Pirate Bay Four ended and the judges retired to deliver a verdict.  The prosecution believed that the four defendants “facilitated the distribution of copyrighted content” and claimed millions of dollars in damages.  The defense objected and asked the defendants to drop the charges, brilliantly engaging the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/poll-is-the-pirate-bay-guilty-or-not-090412/inimitable">“defense of King Kong”</a> . <br><br>  Today, April 17, the court announced its decision.  Below are the main points concerning each of the accused. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d7/6b4/c1a/1d76b4c1a7e2955073e8eabd8df743aa.jpg" align="left" alt="brokep"><br>  <strong>Peter Sunde (09/13/1978), aka "brokep":</strong> <br>  <strong>Verdict:</strong> guilty;  1 year in prison;  damage recoverable: $ 905 thousand <br>  Peter Althin, a lawyer at brokep, <a href="http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_2749103.svd">said</a> : “I spoke with Peter, and he didn’t look surprised.  The journalist with whom he spoke an hour before the public announcement of the verdict, knew that all four would be found guilty.  That is, the verdict somehow “leaked” from the court.  I need time to weigh the consequences of this sentence.  I consider the fact of information leakage out of court unacceptable. ” <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/590/cd5/d60/590cd5d60c572e8070a28fe0380f9c2c.jpg" align="left" alt="Tiamo"><br>  <strong>Fredrik Neij (04/27/1978), aka "TiAMO":</strong> <br>  <strong>Verdict:</strong> guilty;  1 year in prison;  damage recoverable: $ 905 thousand <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/281/4d1/43f/2814d143f646ef2899a6fc222746d6f0.jpg" align="left" alt="Anakata"><br>  <strong>Gottfrid Svartholm (10/17/1984), aka "Anakata":</strong> <br>  <strong>Verdict:</strong> guilty;  1 year in prison;  damage recoverable: $ 905 thousand <br>  Anakata’s lawyer, Ola Salomonsson, <a href="http://svt.se/2.27170/1.1523234/hard_dom_i_pirate_bay-malet%3Flid%3Dpuff_1523150%26">said</a> : “We will appeal.  It is very unexpected that the court considered the defendants a criminal group. ” <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14f/e25/f66/14fe25f66b4e2c63fa68fcc4cd91f444.jpg" align="left" alt="Carl lundstrom"><br>  <strong>Carl Lundström (04/13/1960)</strong> <br>  <strong>Verdict:</strong> guilty;  1 year in prison;  damage recoverable: $ 905 thousand <br><br><br><br><br>  The court stated that the four defendants acted as a criminal group, were aware that the copyrighted material was distributed through The Pirate Bay and that they facilitated and contributed in every possible way to violating the law.  This allows us to classify wine as "grievous."  The judge also said that The Pirate Bay users committed the crime first by sharing their files, and the four helped it. <br><br>  Although the court considered the alleged losses to be too high, he still considered that the correct amount of losses amounts to 30 million SEK ($ 3,620,000).  This is a huge amount, and the court demanded to divide this responsibility between the accused. <br><br>  The judge also stated that the use of BitTorrent technology in The Pirate Bay is illegal.  There is no doubt that other Swedish torrent sites will closely monitor the situation. <br><br>  The defense claims that the judge was under strong political pressure.  The judge denies this allegation, stating that he made this decision based solely on the circumstances revealed during the hearing of the case. <br><br>  When the judge was asked if he was worried about his personal safety after the sentence was passed, he replied that he had not received any threats and was very surprised by this question. <br><br>  The judge does not have to hope that he will be flooded with flowers for such a verdict;  however, Roger Wallis, who endorsed The Pirate Bay during the hearing and who received <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-witness-wife-overwhelmed-with-flowers-090227/">mountains of flowers</a> for it, <a href="http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/musik/roster-om-pirate-bay-domen-1.846357">remarked</a> : “This will just cause an avalanche of legal proceedings.  Against all Internet providers.  Since these guys contributed to copyright infringement, then the providers, of course, also.  The consequences will be enormous.  The development of high-speed Internet can simply stop. " <br><br>  Peter Sunde has already explained that such a decision in no way means the end of the story.  Appeals will be filed, which means that the case is still very far away - the proceedings may take years.  It is now expected that the case will be transferred to a higher court.  Both parties have three weeks to file a written appeal. <br><br>  Rasmus Fleischer, one of the founders of Piratbyrån, <a href="http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_2748647.svd">remarked</a> : “The verdict has no formal consequences and no legal force.  We decided to treat the process as a theatrical play, and from this point of view, it turned out to be much better than we could imagine. ” <br><br>  As for the fate of the site, Peter has already promised that The Pirate Bay will continue its work.  By itself, the site was not the subject of proceedings, but only four of its founders. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57538/</a></p>
