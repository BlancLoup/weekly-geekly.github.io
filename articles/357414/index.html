In order to make this possible, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media has prepared amendments to the Law ‚ÄúOn Communications‚Äù.  The amendments, if adopted, will help to maintain the performance of sites in the national domain zones. Ru and. Rf even in the case of the introduction of technological sanctions.  This will allow the relevant infrastructure to be accessible from the outside. <br><br>  The draft law indicates the need to create a national system of root DNS servers in Russia, <a href="https://iz.ru/633664/vladimir-zykov/runet-zashchitiat-ot-tekhnologicheskikh-sanktcii">writes</a> Izvestia.  This, according to legislators, must be done to prevent the possibility of interference with the work of the Russian segment of the Network.  The explanatory note states that ‚Äúthe subsystem provides interaction with similar national root server systems of other states (for example, China)‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If Russia for any reason loses access to foreign servers, then Russians and residents of other states will be able to work with sites from the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet.

      ‚ÄúThis will increase network reliability.  If five years ago, I would consider such a shutdown as a theoretical threat, today there is a feeling that there is a similar probability, ‚Äùexplained the Director of the Coordination Center of the national domain of the Internet, Andrey Vorobyev. <br><br>  The bill also states that the Ministry of Communications should be part of the founders of the Coordination Center.  True, the document does not spell out exactly what percentage of the KC the state should own.  But, according to Vorobiev, these parameters can be defined in by-laws, which the government will prepare a little later.  Another point stated in the document is that traffic exchange points should belong only to those Russian legal entities where the total share of foreign owners does not exceed 20%.  Plus, the communication cable, which passes through the state border of Russia, can belong only to the company that has a license of a communication operator in Russia.  Today, the situation is somewhat different - there are a number of international companies that own cross-border communication lines laid out for their own needs. <br><br>  If a company owns a cross-border cable, then, in the opinion of the legislators, it must ensure compliance with the technical requirements established by the Ministry of Communications in coordination with the FSB.  This implies the requirements of ‚Äúusing specialized traffic control equipment at such junctions‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe use the Internet, which is operated from abroad.  From there addresses are given, route information.  If we draw an analogy with road traffic, then we build roads and junctions, and where the road signs will stand and how they will work, decide abroad.  It seems to be our roads, and are controlled from nowhere.  Therefore, the direction of work is the right one.  But we need to look at the nuances of the bill and by-laws, ‚Äùsaid the head of the Information Democracy Foundation, Ilya Massuh. <br><br><h3>  If you control, then everything </h3><br>  At various times, various officials have declared the need to take the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet under the full control of the government.  For example, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia for countering terrorism, Oleg Syromolotov, said that for effective work it is necessary to establish full control over the Internet: ‚ÄúInternet governance must be international.  Every country in its sector must have sovereignty.  Americans are resisting this under the pretext that they have created the Internet and would like to control everything themselves. ‚Äù <br><br>  And the <a href="http://nac.gov.ru/">National Anti-Terrorism Committee of</a> Russia (NAC), on behalf of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/19/04/2016/57163a459a79472b3512770d">created a working group</a> to discuss the regulation of encrypted traffic.  And its head <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274584/">was the</a> head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov.  This group includes representatives of all security agencies, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Communications and Industry, and industry experts from the Russian Association of Electronic Communications (RAEC). <br><br>  Well, on July 19, the State Duma deputies in two readings immediately <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/291291/">adopted amendments</a> to the law "On Information ...".  Part of these requirements is the identification of users by phone number.  The document said that it was necessary to ‚Äúidentify users using the subscriber number on the basis of an identification agreement concluded by the organizer of instant messaging with a telecom operator‚Äù. <br><br>  The second part of the amendments regulates the work of anonymizers and VPN in Russia.  They are obliged to add prohibited information sites to their own blacklists.  If these resources do not fulfill the requirements of the law, they, in turn, will also be blocked. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>PS</b> When commenting on this material, please follow the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/info/help/rules/">rules Geektimes</a> .
