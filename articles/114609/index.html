The first such call passed at the end of last week.  However, the format of it, at least for me, was somewhat strange - it was essentially a monologue of Dmitry Dmitriy Grishin, General Director, and the company's Operations Director, a question and answer session was not held.  At the same time, precisely the answers to the questions of analysts have always been the most interesting part of such events.  Another feature is that the company's preliminary unaudited indicators for the past six months and a year were published.  Final figures are expected in April. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the updated <a href="http://corp.mail.ru/en/IR/news/1031">page of the</a> group, all financial indicators are available, a call with investors and a more than detailed text review in English.

      First of all, let me remind you that, in accordance with the rules of the open company, Mail.Ru Group has published a structure of <a href="http://corp.mail.ru/IR/shareholder_capital/">ownership of</a> assets. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/433/4bf/5cb/4334bf5cb06f876cc44649554c51739d.jpg" width="320" height="246">  As for the main results, the group's revenues amounted to <strong>$ 186.6 million</strong> in six months and <strong>$ 324 million</strong> in 2010, which is respectively 59% and <strong>64%</strong> higher than a year earlier.  Excluding the acquisition of ICQ is 50% and 58%, respectively.  By the way, this transaction has not yet been officially completed and is being considered by the American authorities. <br><br>  The group's net profit was <strong>$ 40.2 million</strong> in six months and <strong>$ 76.7 million</strong> in 2010, which is, respectively, 27% and <strong>63%</strong> higher than 2009.  The cash flow amounted to $ 118.4 million. I also remind you that the group owns 32.55% of the social network VKontakte and 21.35% of Qiwi. <br><br>  Also available are figures for individual assets of the group - the income of the Mail.Ru portal was $ 226.3 million, the Odnoklassniki social network - $ 68.9 million, and the HeadHunter recruitment portal - $ 28.7 million. <br><br>  Unlike other large IT companies, Mail.Ru Group publishes figures separately for online visitors to its sites.  In December, the average number of unique visitors per month was 27.2 million people (figures only for Russia), which is 14% higher than June and 21% higher than last December.  The number of visitors to the social network <a href="">‚ÄúMoiMir@Mail.Ru</a> ‚Äù - 19.5 million per month and 5.3 million per day.  At Odnoklassniki - 17.4 million per month and 7.2 million per day.  That is, more people come to OK per day, but less per month.  Similar figures for the mail service Mail.Ru itself - 22.7 million per month and 10.9 million per day.  This is the leader of the Russian market.  The number of Mail.Ru Agent users is 18.7 million, ICQ has 33.5 million in the world, of which 16.4 million in Russia. <br><br>  The group noted that it had sold 3.74% of the company's Qiwi instant payments for $ 24.1 million. This is part of the company's international expansion strategy, along with a strong foreign partner, Mitsui. <br><br>  We should also note the serious growth of online advertising, which is traditionally one of the main income items of any Internet company.  For the year growth was 74%.  The average number of paying users of multiplayer online games (MMO) has increased over the year from 127.2 million to 191.6 million people. <br><br>  This is the first public reporting of Mail.Ru Group - it will be very interesting to observe their <a href="http://af.reuters.com/finance/quotes/quote%3Fsymbol%3DMAILRq.L">dynamics</a> .  At the moment, leading financial companies and publications consider the IPO of the group to be extremely successful, and Yuri Milner recently received the Crunchies award as the best <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/252810/biznesmen_goda">investor of the year</a> .  As a conclusion, I suggest <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/22/yuri-milner-crunchies/">watching</a> his interview with the creator of TechCrunch portal Michael Arrington.  It's worth it :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114609/</a></p>
