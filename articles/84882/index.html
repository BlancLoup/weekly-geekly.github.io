  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OpenSolaris community is concerned about Oracle's silence</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Peter Tribble, vice president of the OpenSolaris Governing Body, wrote on his blog about how he and other community members are unsuccessfully trying to communicate with Oracle.  I must say that the British are very restrained in expressing their emotions, so if he writes something like shockingly poor treatment, it means that he is really very sick.  Oracle, in general, once again demonstrates its ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù to the ideas of OSS. <br>  Below is the translation of the Tribble record. <br><br>  <b>OpenSolaris: Oracle, where are you?</b> <br><br>  After a long wait, Oracle completed the Sun acquisition and at the end of January presented its plans for developing the products of the absorbed company.

      OpenSolaris was not even mentioned.  If you look at the Oracle presentation carefully, OpenSolaris flashes somewhere on the slide, but there is no information about the plans. <br><br>  This silence continues.  Oracle completely ignores OpenSolaris, as if we do not exist at all. <br><br>  Somewhat concerned about this state of affairs, I turned to Oracle with a request to somehow communicate with the OpenSolaris Governing Body.  This appeal was ignored.  OGB quite unequivocally explained to those Sun staff with whom we have contact that a certain level of communication with the community is simply necessary.  The answer was silence. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It cannot be said that we are asking for something unreal, just to start some kind of basic interaction.  I have no doubt that in Oracle everything is very busy right now, but don't even bother with a simple greeting? .. <br><br>  Oracle recently sent welcome letters to (to some) the leaders of the OpenSolaris User Group.  We welcome any communication, but the way that Oracle has chosen is considered unsuccessful.  The company ignored OpenSolaris as a whole, ignored other groups that make up the OpenSolaris community, as well as the Governing Board.  Such an appeal is shocking. <br><br>  I tried to connect with Oracle.  Like other attempts, this one did not bring any result.  I didn‚Äôt wait from Oracle for even elementary politeness - confirmation that my appeal was received. <br><br>  I am not alone in this.  Obviously, the OpenSolaris community is very concerned that it does not receive any information from Oracle.  Ben (Ben Rockwood - approx.) Published in his blog an open letter to Oracle, and this also did not cause any reaction. <br><br>  At least it's just impolite.  You can say frankly rude.  Is this a sign of something more sinister?  At the moment, nothing has been said that would confirm the fears, but this ignore gives rise to the spread of FUD. <br><br>  Needless to say, this is a very unfortunate beginning of a relationship.  It‚Äôs time for Oracle to stop ignoring us and make its intentions public, especially in view of the upcoming elections to the OpenSolaris Governing Board. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84882/</a></p>
