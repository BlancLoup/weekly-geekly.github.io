I hope it will come in handy for those who make portable electronics and various IoTs.  In the article I will describe the scheme of my tester and tell you how it works.  I will give the results of measurement of batteries LIR2032.  And check out eight CR2032 from different manufacturers.  I will also share a wealth of experience: which batteries are better not to take, and which ones are good.  I will sign the dangerous moments with a bonus: and how not to suffer and not burn the house yourself, as Kreosan likes to do. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fb/645/79f/2fb64579f40649d5a805101ac7eb7721.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="oglavlenie">  Table of contents: </h2><br><p>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">For what?</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">Key parameters and verification algorithm</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">Work indication and log</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">Microcontroller and how to flash it</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">Whole scheme</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">Power scheme</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">Diagram of one of eight channels LIR2032 / CR2032</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">Pro charging and charge controller</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">Pay</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">Battery Results LIR2032</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">Test results for 8 different CR2032 batteries</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">Results and about battery quality</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">About safety</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315110/">Conclusion and link to my github project</a> </p><br><h1 id="dlya-chego">  For what? </h1><br><p>  In order to be self-employed and as a hobby, we are making wrist devices with another circuit designer, which operate in two modes: active and standby.  In the active mode, a beautiful, smooth and responsive interface is required, so the consumption is within 10-15 mA.  In standby mode, only the watch works, consumption - units of microamps.  The device has data synchronization via USB, therefore, it should be able to charge.  Therefore, we use rechargeable tablet batteries in the form factor CR2032, they are called LIR2032. </p><br><p>  The devices are sold to Europe.  These customers are more demanding on quality than domestic consumers, and therefore it is important that all devices work for a long time and approximately the same time.  And the biggest problem is the quality control of batteries.  Quickly they did not check, and the volume has grown so much that I had to make this tester.  What I will discuss further. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/210/68d/74b/21068d74bc7b4b909265fde5501eaf28.png" alt="image"></p><br><h1 id="osnovnye-parametry">  Main settings </h1><br><ol><li>  Powered by USB 5V, 400mA. </li><li>  Type of batteries and batteries LIR2032, CR2032 (with restrictions) </li><li>  The number of at the same time checked accumulators: 8 pieces </li><li>  Individual two color indication of the status of each battery </li><li>  Monochrome general status LED. </li><li>  Per second text log for each battery. </li><li>  Measuring instruments: voltages and rates of its change, time, capacity in ¬µA / h. </li><li>  Discharge load: 250 Ohm (~ 10mA). </li><li>  Charging current: 30mA </li><li>  Test cycle time: 4-6 hours. </li></ol><br><h1 id="algoritm-proverki">  Check algorithm </h1><br><p>  The difference between LIR2032 and CR2032 is that CR2032 batteries and LIR rechargeable batteries.

For this, I took the accumulated statistics from 500+ working and suitable batteries: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c5/2c6/2d3/1c52c62d313443698cfacc399961f866.png"><br><p>  It turned out that yes, there is a dependency, but only on the time of discharge to the load. <br>  By the time of charge is too indirect.  And with small capacities in the range of 25-30mA, a timeout of the minimum charge time can be seen at the charger chip - mountains formed.  shelf. </p><br><p>  Two groups of batteries are also noticeable: one is the new branded EEMB with a capacity of 34-40 mA / h, the others are also EEMB, but of the 13th year of release with a capacity of 25-30 mA / h.  I accidentally found the second group among my stocks while I was doing an article and decided to also drive out and give it to the assembly fit. </p><br><p>  Made the animation of the first 65 measurements of different batteries: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76d/c75/aa5/76dc75aa537d405f85e5fa5a6a009a5c.gif"><br><p>  the upper graph is the voltage in mV, the horizontal time scale is 16000 seconds wide <br>  the lower graph is the rate of change of the upper graph in ¬µV / s. </p><br><h1 id="rezultaty-proverki-8-raznyh-batareek-cr2032">  Test results for 8 different CR2032 batteries </h1><br><p>  <strong>Immediately I warn you that the battery tester is not designed for CR2032</strong> .  They are designed for discharge by micro amperes and units of milliamperes, besides, the load less than 1 kŒ© is not recommended to be connected.  But I have cheap Chinese products where it is broken, for example, toys for children and cats with LEDs.  And I remember that it was in this case that the branded batteries showed themselves the worst, and the cheap consumer goods did well. </p><br><p>  If desired, you can drop out three of the four single-kilohm resistors - for this, the load is done on the board.  Or solder another resistor in general more, for example 10k.  If the community is interested, I can do it, but the results will not be very soon. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b50/cbd/efd/b50cbdefdfa7489da11099685bc1faee.jpg"><br><p>  The results are made in the form of a table on threshold slices, ranging from 2000 mV to 2900 mV in increments of 100 mV. <br>  Those.  The capacity in milliamer-hours is measured as if they were discharged to 2000 mV, or 2100 mV, and so on to 2.9 V. The higher the threshold, the smaller the capacity. <br>  Unit of mA / h. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2e/bfe/751/c2ebfe75110b441baf99a27b8a3530ed.png"><br><p>  The green-red gradient is individual for each column and independent of adjacent columns. </p><br><p>  Yes, indeed, simple and cheap batteries such as ERA, megamag and Trophy, better in this situation.  That confirmed my previous experience of using them. <br>  <strong>But I repeat once again - the batteries are not required to issue such a current!</strong> </p><br><p>  Often, CR2032 batteries are attached using miniature magnets, for example, in a misfit shine fitness bracelet, and therefore must be able to magnet well.  And yes, indeed all 8 batteries are attracted by a magnet perfectly. </p><br><h1 id="itogi-i-pro-kachestvo-akkumulyatorov">  Results and about battery quality </h1><br><p>  I personally liked the tester, it is very convenient to use.  And at 4 o'clock the cycle fits well with personal life - in the morning I set it - at lunch I changed the next one, after work I changed all 8 pieces again, and for the night another 8 pieces.  They do not require much time, especially if you do not connect to the terminal and do not log. </p><br><p>  The battery problem has been resolved. <br>  We previously bought the Chinese "nouneym" batteries, but they turned out to be almost 100% rejected. <br>  The company EEMB branded themselves better than others - they have stable parameters and a marriage of 2-3%.  And in some of the 50-40 pieces of pallets, not a single defective one.  They are also well experienced long-term storage for 3-4 years, but the percentage of marriage rises to 10%. </p><br><p>  For comparison, the screenshot of the first 100 pieces, where EEMB and where ordered for aliexpress, I think will be clearly visible immediately. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/083/cd0/aaf/083cd0aaf4664f86b15e0e4059b53ed3.png"><br><p>  there are three batches: the first 40pcs are the new EEMBs, the second is the fresh "nouneym" of China, the last 15 pieces are the EEMBs that have been left for three years without use.  It is noticeable that even a little degraded 15 pieces of EEMB are better than Chinese ones. </p><br><h1 id="pro-tehniku-bezopasnosti">  About safety </h1><br><ol><li>  Remember that when a short circuit and the batteries and batteries noticeably warm.  Yes, even such small, low-powered and low-capacity ones.  Especially if you work with a large number, then it‚Äôs not the best idea even to discard defective ones in one pile.  If you are certainly not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kreosan">Kreosan</a> . </li><li>  The batteries are flat, and I want to take them in a pile, but even in a discharged battery, the voltage is 3-4V, and in the stack it can reach dangerous 50-70V.  Stack them can not be folded, even defective.  Unless, of course, you want to be another proof of Darwin's theory. </li><li>  Chinese batteries often swell and flow unpleasant to the smell of liquid, from which a headache and itchy fingers.  If you deal with Chinese consumer goods, then gloves and well-ventilated non-residential premises are necessary. </li></ol><br><h1 id="zaklyuchenie-i-ssylka-na-moy-proekt-na-githabe">  Conclusion and link to my github project </h1><br><p>  I did not want to write an article, because  I thought that since the IoT theme is popular in Habr√©, there are definitely reviews about such batteries, but I haven‚Äôt. </p><br><p>  By the way, I am looking for a job and at the moment I also accept one-time orders for development or production. </p><br><p>  Link to github project: <br>  <a href="https://github.com/Mirn/LIR2032_tester/">https://github.com/Mirn/LIR2032_tester/</a> <br>  MIT license, use on health! <br>  I also do not mind talking about the experience of use.
