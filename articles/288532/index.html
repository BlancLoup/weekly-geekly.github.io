And about blogs forever forget. "  Heroically I will answer this question: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll definitely invent some garbage!  Perhaps even in the next seventeen days.  And I will live on the author until the end of his days.  But I will not forget about blogs!  My memory is good. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, in this review I will continue to acquaint you with the best, in my opinion, Russian-language blogs. <br><br>  Advertising awful octopus flooded all our free living space.  Therefore, it is pointless to resist it, but to listen only to high-quality advertising is quite capable.  Moreover, <a href="http://mastertext.spb.ru/blog">AD BLOG</a> helps us in this, advertising through the eyes of an advertiser.  This blog is run by Dmitry Kot, a copywriter, and almost every day interesting notes about advertising or criticism of commercials appear in it.  I really like the easy syllable that keeps a diary, besides, I have always been interested in beautiful advertising.  I hope this blog will interest and our advertisers. <br><br>  As much as I didn‚Äôt want, but it‚Äôs probably worth mentioning in my reviews also super popular blogs.  I do not want to do this for a simple reason - everyone already knows about them.  It is better to spend this newspaper space on the less well-known diaries.  However, I am sure that there will be readers on the forum who will grumble: ‚ÄúAnd why in the reviews there is nothing about Exler or Parker?‚Äù This already happened when I did not mention our <a href="http://blog.inf.by/">blog.inf.by</a> in the article about blog services.  Well, get it.  To the address <a href="http://exler.ru/">exler.ru the</a> site of Alexander Exler imposingly stretched.  This person is not at all simple - the author of a large number of stories, reviews and essays (which are at least ‚ÄúNotes of the programmer‚Äôs wife‚Äù), editor, radio host, manager of many Internet projects.  In short, the merits of this person can be listed for a long time and from this confusion it can be understood that his blog ( <a href="http://exler.ru/blog">exler.ru/blog</a> ) is very interesting to read.  What, in fact, is already engaged in a lot of people.  Exler, by the way, is one of the oldest bloggers in Russia, no matter how pathetic it may sound.

      From the same category blog <a href="http://idiot.ru/">idiot.ru</a> , which is probably the most scandalous personality of the Russian blogosphere mr.Parker.  This pseudonym hides Maxim Kononenko, who, in addition to his blog, created a number of outrageous projects, for example, <a href="http://vladimir.vladimirovich.ru/">vladimir.vladimirovich.ru</a> (I think everything is clear from the name) or " <a href="http://luna.msk.ru/">Lunar Consulate in Moscow</a> ".  In addition, he invented, conducted, and presented the ZhZhpremiyu his own name, than gained himself even more sworn friends and comrades.  As you can see, the personality is the most versatile and reading his blog is a great pleasure.  Get ready for the fact that there will be a lot of records and your aggregator will work at full capacity. <br><br>  Well, now move from the stars to normal bloggers.  Although, a blogger, by definition, can not be normal.  Dmitry Podzyvalovsky, who is a software tester in the world, maintains his own <a href="http://softreview.com.ua/">Software Review</a> blog in the virtual.  Again, almost everything is clear from the name of the blog.  For those who are not at odds with a great and powerful English language, I will explain - Dima writes about software, useful web services and events in the IT world.  Why do I draw your attention to this blog?  Because the author in each of his notes briefly, but very clearly describes all the pros and cons of a particular program.  We immediately see that this tester.  For example, I found some useful programs for myself because of this blog.  It is a pity that fresh entries do not appear often, and the last note is dated April 11. <br><br>  From the tester go to the web developer.  Nemytchenko Ivan from Omsk is the only and unique author of the blog <a href="http://zoob.ru/">Zoob</a> .  What can a web developer blog be about?  About the insides of teddy bears and the process of making caramels?  Of course not.  Web programming, computers, IT and so on and so forth.  Most of the entries in the webdev section, where the author gently touches both php, javascript, and sql, and html ... Predictable sequence, don't you find?  In general, all the notes are big and interesting.  That is why, probably, there are not as many of them as we would like, and they do not appear often.  Be sure to put this blog in your aggregators, otherwise I will come to you and live. <br><br>  With a naked eye, a quiet trickle of migration of Russian bloggers to a Google blog service with the poetic name blogspot is noticeable.  <a href="http://felixm.blogspot.com/">Felix Muchnik‚Äôs blog</a> , named fmm (probably in honor of the author‚Äôs full name), gained great popularity in a relatively short time.  Small notes on the Internet and large articles in Computerra only increase interest in the diary of Felix.  In fact, praising this blog is like talking about the usefulness of water.  You will like it regardless of my praises.  Anyone who doesn‚Äôt have this blog in aggregators blush and feel free to go out. <br><br>  A frequent guest was (and probably will be) the <a href="http://register.intruder.ru/">intruder's register</a> blog.  Unfortunately, I can not say anything about the author of this diary.  Encrypted notably, it is possible that he is a Paraguayan spy, as soon as I have more accurate data, I will inform you.  Well, the blog itself about design, people, movies, books - in general about life.  This diary won me over with his tongue, which immediately attracts attention and makes me read the notes to the end.  There are many articles, they appear with an average periodicity (in any case, they do not let me forget that such a blog exists), it is interesting to read - what else is necessary for happiness? <br><br>  The fact that corporate blogs attract additional customers is clear to everyone.  Customers are attracted several times by interesting corporate blogs.  This is exactly the <a href="http://icontext.ru/blog">blog of the</a> Russian content advertising agency Icontext.  It is remarkable that this blog is run by a girl, Maria Chernitskaya, who is also the director of this agency.  You must admit that you immediately begin to treat the company differently when you find out that its director maintains his own blog.  Notes, of course, about advertising, but reading them is very interesting, in any case, I learned a lot of useful things for myself.  Although, how can this information be useful to me if I'm not an advertiser?  Come, read, add to aggregators. <br><br>  <b>Bloolyolyub-natural Lesha Kaletsky</b> <br>  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/173164.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/173164.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006160604.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 16, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288532/</a></p>
