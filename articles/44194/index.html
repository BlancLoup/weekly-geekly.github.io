  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Impressions of the Opera Software conference. Novosibirsk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> So, yesterday, 7/11/2008, I successfully persuaded classmates to attend an Opera seminar.  And all because I am a member of the <a href="http://www.opera.com/education/campuscrew/getstarted/russian">Opera Campus Crew</a> , or otherwise, a representative of Opera at his university. <br>  On the whole, I liked the seminar very much, there were interesting moments.  Briefly tell you about them :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The conference began with the fact that they talked about the Opera company, about the staff, the result is as follows: <br><br>  The company employs about 500 people, over the last year 100,000,000 of their browsers were downloaded, which of course is less than Firefox, but I think it‚Äôs still good.  They continued the story about Opera Mobile, boasted that they had managed in 2005 to create a mobile browser that can work correctly with Ajax.  At the moment, Opera Mobile for WM and UIQ has more options, but soon it is planned to continue development for S60.  And of course they have not forgotten about Opera Mini, it turns out that there are as many as 20 million users.  Russia leads in the number of users, which is good :).  By the way, 50% of Russian GPRS-traffic is spent just by mini opera. <br><br>  Further, they did not forget to mention the Internet as an application platform, the main advantage in their opinion is that the Internet is accessible everywhere, and it is flexible.  It was told about WEB-standards (W3C, etc.), I think about this is not worth telling as everything is clear.  They praised that Opera itself is involved in the development of web standards, as many as 25 employees are doing just that, mostly W3C of course.

      About their features - Widgets of the seminar were not forgotten either, quite a lot of good things were said in their favor, for example, that they are easily portable to different platforms, can work either online or offline, only changed data is downloaded from the Internet , which of course is important for users with tariffs for paying for traffic and ‚Äúmobile‚Äù users, and creating widgets is quite simple according to their application. <br><br>  They told about Dragonfly (Firebug for Opera), the convenience lies in the fact that the debugger can work remotely (Suppose you debug a widget on a mobile phone will be difficult and inconvenient, and with such features you can debug widgets directly from your computer).  Works according to this scheme <br><br> <code><br> Dragonfly <br> | <br> Proxy <br> | <br> Scope</code> <br> <br>  Scope is how I understood the interface in each opera with the kernel version 2.1 used for remote debugging. <br>  API Scope has not yet been finalized until the end, but they promise to make it public soon. <br><br>  A very useful feature: you can run two instances of the debugger: <br>  Scheme: <br><br> <code>| Host | | Client | <br> | Scope | -- | Proxy | <br></code> <br><br>  The next topic of the conference was different graphics, we started talking about PNG.  That he, as a free replacement for GIF, supports animation!  (did not know about it) and W3C standardized in a very good format for WEB.  But there is a big minus, like all formats that store a bitmap image - at high magnification the picture does not scale, and you can see the quadruplets, which look very ugly.  Therefore, they offer a vector SVG, which does not lose its quality even on a large scale.  In interleaving with XHTML, you can create interesting interactive animations, for example, as shown at the conference analog clock.  From the SVG theme, we smoothly switched to the theme of drawing, although it is more difficult to draw with it, it has more features.  (Demonstrated 3-d shooter :) Here are photos, forgive me for quality habrayuzer) <br><br> <a href="http://img222.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dx0d525a3dqr9.jpg"><img src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/9265/x0d525a3dqr9.th.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br>  On this, in general, everything, I think it will be interesting to those who wanted to go, but could not. <br>  PS Oh, yes, more, they donated a CD with an Opera, a sticker, a branded pen and a package.  Here it is. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44194/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44194/</a></p>
