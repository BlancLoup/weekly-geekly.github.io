Rita Radner, who co-wrote the screenplay for the film ‚ÄúFriends of Peter‚Äù and also played it with Stephen Fry and Hugh Lowry, once made a wonderful statement, which she attributes to why she doesn‚Äôt prepare: ‚ÄúI read the recipes in the same way like science fiction.  I read to the end and tell myself that this will never happen. ‚Äù <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Science fiction writers do not predict the future, they can shape it, affecting engineers who look at Captain Picard (Star Trek) using a tablet to get information about local life forms and think: "How to make it real?".  But the writers themselves did not predict the creation of tablets in the future.  Understanding this, David Frew suggests 5 major trends.

      <b>The death of the campaign.</b> <br>  Phil Georgiadis, chairman of Blue 449 (Walker Media after rebranding), said not so long ago with regret that the time will soon come when the media plan will be received in the morning, realized before dinner, and you can spend the rest of the day in the pub.  That sounds a little weird.  We are progressing further in the era of perpetual campaigns, constant online presence with messages designed for specific content, instead of SMS bombing or individual letters and localized promotions.  Words like ‚Äúdeath of the campaign‚Äù are nonsense in the future. <br><br>  <b>OpenDirect and further development of software reserve.</b> <br>  The IAB was fully open to public consultation and commenting on the joint project of AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo, Yieldex, Bionic Advertising Systems and MediaMath - OpenDirect 1.0.  Now a high-standard API project for the purchase and sale of premium inventory operates in accordance with the finalized version of January 2015. <br><br>  Another interesting discovery was the study of CBS Interactive and FaR: ‚ÄúThe Evolution of Online Media‚Äù, which reports that the financial market has automated the sale of premium materials such as oil, gold, and trust has changed.  Programmatic trade seems to start from the bottom and did more than labor of Sisyphus in this area.  What to say about advertising. <br><br>  <b>Creation of a team to combat fraud</b> . <br>  Everyone should already be familiar with JICWEBS - the Joint Committee for Web Standards and the excellent work they do in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãContent Verification Principles.  In accordance with these Principles, the group conducts an audit and also develops new self-regulating principles that will bring even more trust and openness, while reducing risks. <br><br>  <b>Consolidation and merger.</b> <br>  In the field of programming, consolidation and merger processes occur quite often.  There are many venture capital companies and multi-disciplinary organizations on the market that are constantly being sold out.  It is very interesting to watch their competition.  And remember that it is in a competitive environment that development occurs much faster. <br><br>  <b>Long way ahead.</b> <br>  Unresolved issues, such as attribution and the ‚Äústruggle for survival,‚Äù will need to be addressed if we want to be of real value to customers.  It is also necessary to continue to fight fraud and go to a new level of development.  Automation should make our lives easier.  Let's let the machines do the hard work every day, and let the people think about long-term strategies. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294726/</a></p>
