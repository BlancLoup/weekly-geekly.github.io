Do not delay registration if you are going to go!  We publish conversations with our speakers, and today this is <b><a href="http://www.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Klabnik</a></b> - a member of the Rust core team, an active open source contributor and a very interesting conversationalist! <br>  Author of the books ‚ÄúThe Rust Programming Language‚Äù, ‚ÄúRails 4 in Action‚Äù and ‚ÄúDesigning Hypermedia APIs‚Äù.  He lives in Brooklyn, writes about himself that ‚Äúhe spends too much time on GitHub‚Äù. <br><br>  Steve has already spoken at the RailsClub in 2012.  And we also published interviews with him (you can see the curious <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/railsclub/blog/150734/">here</a> ).  Since then, Steve has been closely involved in Rust, made a lot of interesting pieces and we realized that it is necessary to invite him again :) <br><br>  I think our publication will be of interest not only to rubists, but also to fans of Rust, which are becoming more and more common in Russia.  On the last mitap, guys from the Russian-speaking Rust-community <b><a href="https://rustycrate.ru/">rustycrate.ru</a></b> approached us.  Everyone who is interested in Rust after RailsClub is invited to feel free to join and ask questions.

Many of the classes that we know and love are written in Ruby, some are not.  By studying how MRI works, we can learn a lot about Ruby.  In the report, Steve will show a fun hack: rewrite pieces of the Ruby interpreter in Rust.  In the process, we will learn a lot about Ruby's internal structure and how to start hacking code in C. <br><br>  Under the cut we bring our questions, the answers of Steve in the original and in our free translation: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  I mainly work on Rust.  But the language is a huge project, it includes a lot of everything: I am rewriting the official book about Rust, working on the <a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik/semver">Semver</a> package, working a bit on our package manager ... so much to do! <br>  I also have a third-party project <a href="https://intermezzos.github.io/">intermezzOS</a> .  This is a ‚Äúlearning operating system‚Äù, that is, a small OS, and a learning book is coming to it for those who have never done system programming. <br><br>  I am mostly working on the Rust programming language.  But I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôm not afraid of ! <br>  I also have a side project, intermezzOS.  It is a ‚Äúteaching operating system‚Äù, that is, it is a little OS. <br><br><br>  <b>What is open source for you?</b> <br><br>  First of all, for me, Open Source is a collaboration in the development process.  Instead of everyone doing something different, you work together to achieve a goal.  This does not mean that everyone is working on everything, but it means that you make key project decisions together.  There is always someone who checks your code before it is included in the project.  And you try to involve as many people as possible to the maximum. <br><br>  To me, it is open source development.  That is, you work together towards your goal.  It makes it possible to make it a matter of course. possible. <br><br><br>  <b>What's new lately has attracted your attention in the world of web development?</b> <br><br>  There are three things that interest me: <br>  1. <a href="http://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> .  This project will make even more ambitious web applications possible than those we already have. <br>  2. Project <a href="https://ember-fastboot.com/">Ember's FastBoot</a> .  This is an easy way to take care of the problem of loading the first page for one-page applications. <br>  3. <a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/07/29/announcing-the-glimmer-2-alpha.html">Glimmer 2</a> .  This is a detail of the implementation of Ember, but it reminds me of the emergence of React: I think this is a big step towards making heavy Javascript applications fast. <br><br>  There are three things I'm interested in: <br>  1. WebAssembly.  This has been the case for even more ambitious web applications. <br>  2. Ember's FastBoot project.  For example: <br>  3. Glimmer 2. But it reminds you of the scene: Javascript-heavy web application can achieve speed. <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite resources (blogs / sites / twitter) on web development and programming?</b> <br><br>  I don‚Äôt follow one thing, basically I read Hacker News and Reddit and articles from various other sources. <br><br>  Hacker News and Reddit; <br><br><br>  <b>The last read programming book that you liked?</b> <br><br>  " <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assembly-Language-Step-Step-Programming/dp/0470497025">Assembly Language step by step: programming with Linux</a> ".  Now, few people learn assembler, but it seems to me that this book presents it in a very accessible way.  The first chapters contain many interesting metaphors that really help to understand the concept. <br><br>  "Assembly Language step by step: programming with Linux".  It‚Äôs a very convenient way.  Its early chapters contain a lot of amusing metaphors that grok the concepts. <br><br><br>  <b>Not tired of programming?</b>  <b>What do you do when this happens?</b> <br><br>  Sometimes!  You may notice that a lot of what I am doing now is related to texts: for me, pure programming is not so interesting in itself, it is interesting to combine programming with something else.  This is what I do: I switch to documentation or training for others.  This is still about programming, but not about it. <br><br>  Sometimes!  You‚Äôll notice that you‚Äôve been combining programming with something else.  So that's what I do: I switch to documentation, or teaching.  It's still _about_ programming, but it's not directly programming itself. <br><br><br>  <b>What would you do if you had a couple of months of free paid time?</b> <br><br>  I would try to finish rewriting a book about Rust, because this is the most important work I do.  I am lucky that this is already part of my work :).  Secondly, I would work on intermezzOS all day: I love to do it, but since it is not part of my work duties, I never have enough time for it. <br><br>  I‚Äôm trying to complete the re-writing of the book, as it‚Äôs my most important work.  I'm lucky enough to have my job :)  Second, I really love it, but since it‚Äôs not, I never have enough time. <br><br><br>  <b>Who wanted to be in childhood?</b> <br><br>  I really, really wanted to be an Egyptologist.  I have always admired the ancient Egyptian culture.  But then I learned about computers and found something that seemed even more interesting to me :) <br><br>  I really wanted to be an Egyptologist.  I've always found ancient Egyptian culture fascinating.  I thought was even more interesting.  :) <br><br><br><br><br>  Interesting?
