  <section class="page js-page"><h1>International music venue</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I would like to somewhat update and supplement my previous publication about the professional music platform and the search for the team. <br>  Since my first publication, enough time has passed for which several people turned to me with offers of cooperation, but as a rule almost everyone did not have enough experience or time to develop.  There were also several investors who were not able to find common points because of the complete ideological divergence. <br><br>  So, I want to write in more detail about the project itself, how I see it, why and who it is needed for, and what role it should play in the international arena. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. The general idea.

      As I have already written, I have been working in the music industry for quite a long time and almost all existing Online platforms are not familiar with me.  Each of them offers some kind of assistance in the development and delivery of musical material to the general public.  This is primarily the storage of music content and its publication on a personal page.  In addition, there are thousands of communities on a variety of topics.  This is all definitely useful and necessary.  But!  I did not manage to meet a platform that would offer professional services for all media professionals to work with media content.  That is, first of all (b2b), the project is aimed. <br><br>  2. The meaning of the site <br><br>  First of all, the service should allow to automate all processes of work with / with musical material.  For example, at that time when the track is already written, the musician will always have a tool at hand that will allow him to work in 5 minutes, which he would normally do for 15 days.  And the label, as a publisher, will have the opportunity to interact with high-quality Central Asia for music promotion.  Music reviewers and radio presenters, DJs, stores, critics, and so on. People will always have up-to-date, up-to-date information and content. <br><br>  3. Scale <br><br>  Initially, the project is intended as an international, in English.  I am very aware of the fact that it is impossible to make the entire functional set at once, so at the very beginning I plan to make the minimum necessary set of services and functions for starting the site.  Further, naturally, to increase capacity and develop. <br><br>  4. The team, as I see it all. <br><br>  At the very beginning, that is, now, the most important person I‚Äôm waiting for and looking for is a programmer.  Next - a technician.  These are the people with whom I plan to work shoulder to shoulder in the next 50 years :) Professionals.  It will be necessary to create new, powerful tools that no one else has done :) I will tell you more in detail with personal contact. <br><br>  5. feedback <br><br>  I correct the omission of the previous publication, leaving my coordinates: hk [dog] illustrative.ru, please write a few lines about your experience. <br><br>  I will be glad to cooperate.) <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78610/</a></p>
