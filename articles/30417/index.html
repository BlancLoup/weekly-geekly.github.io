Her name was Conscience.  She was a good person and matched her name ‚Äî she didn‚Äôt take someone else‚Äôs, and if she found a wallet on the road, she always tried to find the owner and return the loss. <br><br>  If she took a spinning wheel from her friends or read a book, she always returned it on time, and she also treated her to pies on top.  And she always lived in harmony with everyone, and in harmony with herself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Second story </h2><br>  There was a simple American man.  His name was Market.  He was distinguished by his direct meaning, grip and prudence.  If you had to buy something, he paid.  If you could take it for free, you took it. <br><br>  He didn‚Äôt disdain sometimes theft, and he didn‚Äôt have an aversion to other unethical little things.  The main thing is not to be caught by the hand.  He also had several relatives - the wife of C. Competition, uncle Torgash, aunt Exchange, the grandfather of the Bank and the children - the son of PR and their daughter Advertising.

      They lived with the whole family actively, not always amicably, but trying by daddy's life to build market justice. <br><br><h2>  Third story </h2><br>  Once the Market arrived in a wild country of Russia and was stunned - open spaces for business were unseen.  Here you and the corporate fields are plowed up, and the stock market forests are not chopped, and the rivers of state money are not taken up.  Well, he took to work properly - to impose market justice, but to cause corporate etiquette. <br><br>  Things went uphill with him, and the local people did not mind.  Yes, here's the problem - he wanted women's affection.  His wife, C. Competition, remained in America, so he decided to marry a local, Russian woman.  And a local couple, the Apparatchitsa and Zomboyashchik, advised him to marry on Conscience.  No sooner said than done.  Got married <br><br>  At first, of course, it was unusual for the bride to be with the Market - how, taking all the money, cheating, hiding ... But then I got used to it and lived with a non-native way of life. <br>  And then the trouble happened - they had a child.  And it turned out to be a terrible freak - a terrible hermaphrodite.  Grieved spouses, grieved, see, however, the boy viable turned out. <br><br>  They took, and called it Market Relations in the USSR. <br><br>  And he gave birth to himself the next exhibit of Kunstkamera - Copyright in Russia ... <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30417/</a></p>
