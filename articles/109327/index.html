    <h4>  # 1: Homepage Text </h4><br>  I hope you don‚Äôt need to explain how important good text is for a website.  Especially if the site is commercial.  But, at the same time, the texts of 90% of the sites of web-studios of the CIS are useless.  Why do I think so? <br><br>  Let's look at a question from the customer and we will be extremely frank.  How many studios are ‚Äú10 years on the web development market‚Äù?  Hundreds.  How many studios "only qualified specialists work"?  In all.  Which studio has the ‚Äúhighest quality and expandable CMS‚Äù?  Each <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So it turns out that all these "advantages" and a penny do not stand.  There can be only 2 real advantages: <b>quality</b> (the portfolio is so awesome that you can pray for it) and the <b>approach</b> .  And if for the first you need rare high-paying personnel, then for the second you can use your own gray matter. <br><br>  Texts should not sell a product, but sell emotions.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãsensations from which the customer will get an orgasm.  ‚ÄúStudio Lebedev‚Äù draws not the most beautiful designs, Apple produces not the most reliable phones, Hollywood makes not the most intelligent films.  And there is always someone who makes everything better, faster, or cheaper.  But, as long as people have emotions, companies with the right approach will always be ahead of just good companies. <br><br>  P.S.  Of course, it‚Äôs not only in the texts, but also in marketing, people, communication, etc.  But you need to start somewhere? :) <br><br><h4>  # 2: Communication with the customer </h4><br>  Suppose a site visitor has already read the texts, studied the portfolio and wants to work with the studio.  The most important task at this stage is to simplify his contact with the manager as much as possible.  Ideally, it should be ‚Äúone click + fill in two or three short fields‚Äù.  Or "one click + communication with the manager."  And better both options at once.  But what do we have? <br><br><h5>  a) insufficient number of communication channels </h5><br>  The classic version of the web-studio site is an indication of a phone number + feedback form + application form (see below).  That is, to ask a question, I must either spend my money, or wait for an answer for an unknown number of hours. <br><br>  At that time, even a simple indication of an ICQ or Skype number in the header of the site will allow me to contact the manager right now, to clarify all questions online and, if desired, to place an order. <br><br>  And if an online communication system is installed (for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/88091/">Zopim</a> ), then I can do the same right on the site, which is even more convenient. <br><br>  And after all, in truth, all these site changes can be made within an hour.  And the effect will pay off on the very first day.  What are the studios waiting for? <br><br><h5>  b) a huge application form </h5><br>  For reasons unknown to me, the vast majority of all application forms on sites are terribly similar to briefs.  10 questions, 12 clarifications and 5 checkmarks for the mark.  What's the point? <br><br>  The site visitor filling in the application is not a studio client yet.  He simply expresses his desire to work with her.  And filling in a long ‚Äúsausage‚Äù of items and checkmarks can easily discourage this desire. <br><br>  ‚ÄúName‚Äù, ‚ÄúE-mail‚Äù, ‚ÄúMobile Number‚Äù and ‚ÄúComments‚Äù are more than enough for any application form.  And, while sculpturing another giant ‚Äúsausage‚Äù, studios should remember that the bulk of their own wallets depends on the convenience of the customer. <br><br><h4>  # 3: Information overload </h4><br>  The main page of the average web-studio meets us with information such as: <br><br>  - Site menu <br>  - Contacts studio <br>  - List of recent works <br>  - Application form with 5-8 fields <br>  - Text about the studio <br>  - Listing of studio services list <br>  - Enumeration of cool studio partners <br>  - Enumeration of cool studio customers <br>  - Block with studio news <br>  - Block with studio articles <br>  - Banner / Spherical Text / ‚ÄúDo You Know What?‚Äù  etc. <br><br>  What do we need from this list, as customers, on the main page? <br><br>  - Site menu <br>  - Contacts studio <br>  - Application form (button) <br>  - List of recent works for cool customers <br>  - Text about the studio (and there is a listing of the list of studio services) <br><br>  What do all the other items do?  They melt brains and distract from tasks. <br><br>  Going to the studio site, we want to find out how good they are (works / text) and how to contact them (contacts).  Everything else (news, full portfolio, articles, etc.) should quietly and peacefully lie in the relevant sections of the site and be shown only if we <b>want it</b> .  Otherwise, it is annoying trash.  And this irritation can easily reach its apogee (transition to another site).  That's the whole logic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109327/</a></p>
