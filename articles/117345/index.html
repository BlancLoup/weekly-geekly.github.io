  <section class="page js-page"><h1>First after Habr</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, Dmitry Navosh, CEO of Sports.ru, who in two years gathered the second most popular thematic community of Runet after Habrakhabr, told RMA <a href="http://www.rma.ru/internet/">Internet specialty</a> listeners, ‚Äúhow and why this happened,‚Äù what inspired them, and what is applicable in other media . <br><br>  Sports.ru is an unusual project for the Russian Internet market.  First, a third of the 30 full-time employees are developers.  Secondly, this is a self-sustaining project - the majority of Russian online media cannot boast.  Thirdly, its <a href="http://www.sports.ru/tribuna/">‚ÄúTribune‚Äù</a> subproject is a ‚Äúsports analogue of Habrahabr‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For eight years, Sports.ru has been an unpaid hobby for a group of sports journalists.  At the end of 2006, they decided to attract investment and turn their passion into a business.  Radical changes on the resource occurred in the summer of 2009, when the community of fans of ‚ÄúTribuna‚Äù was opened, inspired by the example of ‚ÄúHabrahabra‚Äù. <br><br>  Last year it became the fastest-growing site of sports Runet.  In March 2011, attendance exceeded one million users, of which over 250,000 are registered, leading an active social life.  The ‚ÄúTribune‚Äù is updated 24/7 and the volume (and sometimes quality) of the content exceeds the editorial one.  It was not spared by sports clubs and editorial competitors who began to start their blogs.  The community is developing as self-managed (the materials on the main page are carried out by the voices of users) and self-generated, and even its mastermind is blocked in several blogs :)

      But in order to reach the project's fame, growing interest from advertisers and even bans, he and his colleagues had to overcome several fears at once. <br><br><h4>  User fear </h4><br>  Fears were mostly on the topic, ‚Äúwhat if the users‚Äù ... For example, professional journalists were afraid that with the influx of active users, they would ‚Äúgo away‚Äù.  That the content of the posts will become poor quality, and everything will go down to the holivars of the fans - and, naturally, people will stop reading this.  And the loss of the monopoly on broadcasting by the editors will also lead to an increase in the negative in its, editorial, address.  And that, of course, will require serious costs for moderation of all this disgrace. <br><br>  According to Dmitry, ‚ÄúTribunu‚Äù was saved by the rating of participants, taken from Habrahabr experience.  The most difficult was to determine how this rating will be charged and influence other users.  On the one hand, a couple of minuses from the old-timers of the resource should not have "killed" the novice.  On the other hand, user loyalty also had to be encouraged.  Habrahabr in time introduced the current rating system, which was taken as the basis for Sports.ru. <br><br><h4>  Habrapyat: before and after </h4><br>  So, the journalists remained the ‚Äúface‚Äù of the product;  and from among the people leading good thematic blogs (there are hundreds of such magazines), new employees are recruited.  Well, "holivary" ... Sport, in the end, is an emotional thing.  And, interestingly, the ‚Äúinadequate‚Äù in the comments to user posts as a whole is less than to some editorial materials. <br><br>  Users began to show interest to the interactive user and advertiser.  Example: with the support of Supra, Sports.ru launched ratings ratings for football players in the Russian Championship, which users put up after each match.  Users have an incentive to vote: at the end of the season, those players who they call the best players from each club will be awarded prizes. <br><br>  In parallel, to support the activity in the community, services are being developed - communication and gaming.  The latest was its own microblogging service.  That's where Sports.ru has a dozen of its developers. <br><br>  In general, be inspired by good projects and make yours better.  Borrowing a good experience and being able to apply it in oneself is good. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Interestingly, are there many projects in Runet that are somehow inspired by Habrahabr?  For example, a startup graduate of the RMA Internet specialization - StartupPoint <a href="http://www.rma.ru/internet/news/7261/">uses</a> the same mechanics with the division of posts into "all" and "on the main".  Rating blogs and users there too.  And since the fall of 2010, there are no personal blogs either - only collective blogs or start-ups blogs (for the time being).  Who else would you call? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117345/</a></p>
