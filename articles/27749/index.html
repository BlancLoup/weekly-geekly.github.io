  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Test non-standard approaches to promotion. Part 1. Introduction</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For quite some time I have been promoting various Internet projects and in most cases, these are not own projects, but projects of customers.  What does the average customer do?  Yes, nothing interesting.  :) I mainly work with companies, representatives of small businesses that provide some services (b2b, b2c), or sell someone produced goods.  In most cases, everything is trite and boring.  As a rule, each customer has most of the following traits ... <a name="habracut"></a>  : <br><ul><li>  The site is done as the director likes <br>  They don‚Äôt want to work even with a simple control system, but if they want to, then they are at the level of publishing news and changing a couple of lines of text on the main page.  And all the same, they have to be cleaned up after them, since they begin to color the text according to all the colors of the rainbow, each paragraph can be written in different fonts, the tables are all skewed.  After all, it is not always customary to check how their creation looks at the front. <br>  About promotion on the Internet they know practically nothing except SEO and spam.  Often making a website does not even know what to do with it further. <br>  Understanding something else (besides SEO and spam) is not very desirable. <br>  Sometimes it is even hard to convince to try contextual advertising, because Yandex (in their opinion) has a lot of subsidiary companies that work on linking budgets. <br>  They do not know how, do not want and often do not even try to determine where the client came from.  Well, if the Internet is the only source of customers, then at least some of the questions are removed. <br>  Even if a stream of calls is formed (telephone, Internet), then for some reason, the low conversion of these calls is also the fault of those who promote the website, and not of sales managers. <br><br>  If you have something to add or disprove, then welcome to the comments. <br><br>  As a result, it turned out that the main tools to promote customers are: <br><ul><li>  Search engine optimization <br>  contextual advertising <br>  Price lists aggregators (for online stores). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      As a result, I got a little tired of this situation and one of the customers was offered the following scheme of work - we work with the site ourselves (all texts, the structure is ours), we choose the tools for promotion, and the effect of the work is evaluated according to the actual result in the form of online applications on the site.  Neither the texts, nor the key requests, nor the methods are consistent with the representatives of the company, and even this becomes no longer interesting for the customer.  And we are not going to use anything criminal (for example, spam). <br><br>  Small customer characteristic: <br>  <strong>Company class</strong> : Small business (number of employees up to 10 people, it is very easy to interact), B2B, B2C. <br>  <strong>Services</strong> : brokerage (mainly credit), <br>  <strong>The geography of the</strong> provision of services is Moscow (more precisely, credit products from Moscow banks, and the client himself may by registration also be from another city in our homeland) <br>  <strong>Uniqueness</strong> : as always, there is no particular uniqueness in the provision of services.  There is experience, there are connections, but in general the company is similar to dozens of the same on the market. <br><br>  As a result, for the beginning it was decided to try the following areas of work: <br><ul><li>  Mass mailing on bulletin boards (it was interesting, it will work with these services and how) <br>  Collection of specialized low-frequency requests due to more content <br>  Contextual advertising, in which we ourselves select keywords, accordingly make it as budget as possible. <br>  SMO: <br><ul><li>  Community development in the social network vkontakte.ru <br>  Hidden advertising site through other thematic community social network vkontakte.ru <br>  Hidden advertising on thematic forums <br><br>  Naturally, the claimed methods do not cover all the possibilities for promotion.  Simply, this is something that could be done quickly, respectively, the list will expand further. <br><br>  If someone wants to advise something else to use in the first place, then we will discuss it in comments.  If someone can offer traffic, applications or something not standard, then write too - I will consider offers.  If someone wants to use the services of the customer (get a loan) - I will give you contacts. <br><br>  If you are interested in the continuation and results (and I will understand this by the number of votes for the post and the number of comments), then during the week I will give an interim report on the work: <br><ul><li>  How much are the direct costs at the moment <br>  How much time was <br>  Exhaust from bulletin boards <br>  Exhaust from vkontakte.ru <br>  Context exhaust <br>  And my personal conclusions. <br><br>  Phew ... I hope the continuation will follow ... =) </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27749/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27749/</a></p>
