  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Easy on typography</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For a start I will introduce myself.  My name is Eugene (Eugene Spearance) - the author of a well-known site and technology <a href="http://www.typograf.ru/">Typographer</a> . <br>  Having spent the evenings in sweet idleness, I decided to write several articles on the subject of computer layout, reveal the secrets of my own typographer, and share some thoughts about the future development of typography. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  How did it start ... </h2><br>  Maybe now I‚Äôll break the biggest myth, but for me typography started long before reading the immortal <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/kovodstvo/paragraphs/62/">¬ß 62 of the Code</a> , and even more so, long before my acquaintance with the Internet.  Up to the moment I was well established in the network, I worked as a layout maker for about 5 years in several publications of local newspapers and magazines.  Spending a lot of time for the layout, I worked out for myself a certain set of rules, which, it seemed to me, made the text more readable.  Then I accidentally stumbled across the directories of Rosenthal, Milchin and Ruder, and finally fell ill with a competent layout.  Anyway, I think that it was the newspaper-magazine layout that gave me the basic knowledge that I later transferred to typography. <br>  I omit my acquaintance with the Internet and the beginning of the development of the Parser language, I will immediately try to briefly describe the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating my own Typographer.  The first thing that comes to mind is laziness.  Perhaps it was because of her that I thought about the automatic layout.  Of course, like many authors of such services, I also used Lebedev‚Äôs <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/tools/typograf/">Typographer</a> ... and, like many, I was burned by his imperfection.  I wanted to reduce the work of the layout designer (that is, myself) to a minimum, and I did not invent a way except to write my own Typographer.  No, a lazy creature cannot write anything.  First of all, I threw the Samiznateky studio into letters with proposals to supplement the already existing Typographer, and my requests (oh gods) were heard.  Of the dozens of additions that I sent, one or two were implemented, and a couple of minor bugs were fixed, which the studio certainly reported in the logs of the next version.  Frustrated by this phenomenon, I began to collect knowledge bit by bit to write my own Typographer, and meticulously add them to the <a href="http://www.spearance.ru/parser3/regex/">piggy bank of regular expressions</a> . <br>  And so, somewhere at the end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003, I finally matured and created the first version of the Typographer with a set of 32 rules. <br><h2>  Year 2008 </h2><br>  Today, this product is the most comprehensive automatic printing machine of all represented in the Russian-language network.  Indeed, over the past four years I have at least twice rewritten the engine, added a huge number of rules (there are about 170 of them) made a spelling check, introduced the concept of "floating space" into the screen layout and was one of the first to implement typing of "hanging punctuation".  There are 3 implementations of the Typographer: an online service, a web service for remote typography, and a light version of the code for implementation in their projects. <br><h2>  What we can </h2><br>  Type in any text typed from the keyboard, copied from Word, text with hypertext markup ( <acronym>html</acronym> , <acronym>xml</acronym> , <acronym>xsl</acronym> ...).  It does not touch the comments, cascading style sheets, javascript and pre-formatted text. <br>  Edit texts laid down by other handlers. <br>  Tag the text.  Remove tags from text before typography and after (the last function is useful if you need to leave only mnemonic characters).  From tags are placed: paragraphs, line breaks, links, numbered unnumbered lists, acronyms. <br>  To link words with both unbreakable space and non-breaking structures (floating spaces). <br>  Handle hanging punctuation (for advanced users). <br>  And much more‚Ä¶ <br><h2>  From experience </h2><br>  Observations on the printing process gave interesting conclusions, the first thing that struck, the typographer is absolutely adapted to the processing of Ukrainian texts.  I did not know this, but the percentage of texts sent from neighboring countries indicates this.  Also, at the request of colleagues from <a href="http://www.teletype.ru/">teletype.ru</a> , some umlauts were easily added to the typographer, which confirmed its adaptability to other languages. <br>  People have become more careful with the letter Yo, and in principle I consider this to be a greater achievement than the Typographer himself. <br><h2>  Entertaining statistics </h2><br>  The word X * Y is typed at least once a day, while it is absolutely incomprehensible what people want to do: check spelling :) or get the result of the layout. <br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  A lot of work has been done, and the product has already proven its worth.  However, it is sad that the phenomenon of ‚Äútypography‚Äù has not gained the desired wide distribution.  Perhaps it is the absence of advertising, but forgive me, what kind of advertising can a non-commercial project, especially a specific one.  Without a doubt, the stone from a dead center is shifted, and this leaves a certain positive mark. <br>  <s>A month ago, I decided to stop the development and stop working at <a href="http://www.typograf.ru/">www.typograf.ru</a> in the future.</s> <br>  <strong>By popular demand - we continue to live!</strong>  <strong>The fighter did not give up :)</strong> <br><br>  PS Next time I will reveal the secrets of the typographer‚Äôs work. <br>  PPS In the process of preparing the article I used my typographer, while noticing that the pre tags are incorrectly processed on the Habr website :) Good luck! </div>
