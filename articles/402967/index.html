      Yes, why not launch a regular beer glass or coffee cup?  The most that neither is a geeky goods.  This was thought by the developers of the Levitating Cup, who launched a campaign to raise funds for their project <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2037861313/levitatingcup-lift-your-spirits">on Kickstarter</a> and raised more than $ 62 thousand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d4/022/a55/9d4022a55e916fa3d0645314c4ba1363.gif"><br><br>  In principle, all this is suitable for both home use and for "work" in companies.  Who would refuse to drink beer or good brandy from such a vessel?  Well, it‚Äôs cool to drink coffee or tea from a flying mug while working. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f5/5a7/582/0f55a7582e1ecd0834273590695623ae.gif"><br><br>  However, the cost of flying dishes is not so small: one unit will have to pay more than $ 130. <br><br><h3>  LePlant plants floating in the air </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d0f/22f/2d3/d0f22f2d33454ac57cbf0e0b23e8ab03.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  If there is a levitating mug on one side of the table, then why not put a flying cactus or a bonsai tree on the other?  The company LePlant has developed several models of pots for plants that hover in the air.  And sold as a pot, <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/leplant/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating">in itself</a> , and the pots already with plants.  From Madrobots, for example, you can purchase a <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/leplant-bonsay/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating">LePlant Bonsai</a> plant <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/leplant-bonsay/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating">pot</a> , <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/leplant-khamedoreya/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating">LePlant Hamedorea</a> , <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/leplant-tillandsiya/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating">LePlant Thailand</a> .  If you wish, you can arrange flying garden on your desktop or at home.  Well, plus it is also a great gift that should please many. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abd/70f/00e/abd70f00e72e35804ea6926bbbf12ba0.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  There is a similar thing for lovers of flowers and plants.  This is Air Bonsai, which is a system of a decorative platform with a powerful magnet and a sphere of moss or volcanic rock.  The sphere soars at a height of about 2 cm, smoothly rotating around its axis.  Unfortunately, it is available only <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/air-bonsai/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating">on pre-order</a> . <br><br><h3>  Levitating Crealev table lamp </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/554/a68/b6c/554a68b6c34c4db14edc6dbfe48eeb68.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  The Danish company Crealev has developed a desk lamp that looks almost exactly the same as a classic lamp of this type.  With few exceptions - here the upper part of the lampshade soars in the air.  There is also a source of light.  By the way, this company provides information on the power consumption of the levitating system.  At rest (when only electromagnets are turned on), its power consumption is about 3 watts.  Not so much.  Inside - not an ordinary incandescent lamp, but LEDs. <br><br>  True, the cost of this light bulb is such that with this money you can buy LED and ordinary lamps for the rest of your life.  Its price is about 2 thousand euros.  The developers explain this high price by saying that ... yes, they don‚Äôt explain anything. <br><br><h3>  Flyte levitating bulb </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f5/0c2/c5c/0f50c2c5c6df7497e0e658b145eee5b1.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  This is a less expensive version of the levitating lamp.  LEDs are also used here, and Flyte base can also work as a docking station for wireless charging of mobile devices that support this standard.  According to the manufacturers, the lamp can work for a couple of decades if you use it for about 6 hours a day. <br><br>  Here are the characteristics: <br><br><ul><li>  Service life: 50,000 h </li><li>  Energy efficiency: 16 lm / W </li><li>  Maximum brightness: 60 lm </li><li>  Power supply: 15 V </li><li>  Stand dimensions: 126 √ó 126 √ó 30 mm </li><li>  Stand weight: 500 g </li></ul><br>  The base of the bulb connects to the outlet, then the bulb must be placed in the center of the base.  She immediately hangs in the air, spinning.  In order to charge the phone, you need to put it on the stand.  Flyte is available on <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/flyte/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating">pre-order at Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  Aoske Magnetic Levitation Platform </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/469/920/380/46992038086d453687c01b16ede86de9.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  And this is a levitating platform, which is designed for collectors.  On the platform you can put some small object that will stay in the air and rotate.  This object can be watches, jewelry, cosmetics and much more.  In general, a great idea for some watch store or jewelry salon.  But you can use this platform at home, keeping your favorite things always in sight.  It costs about $ 86.  Not so much. <br><br><h3>  Flying charger for phones </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25a/602/21f/25a60221f1ed170b7f87553bce94259e.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  OvRcharge is a levitating charge for phones that keeps the phone above itself.  Wires here are brought only to the docking station.  Of course, the device itself must support the standard of wireless charging. <br><br>  The idea itself is very interesting, this is a cool device for both home and office.  Convenient and attracts attention, right? <br><br><h3>  Levitating charger for smart watches </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e4b/979/76d/e4b97976d6d9c5011851bd257663d194.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  Yes, and there is.  This thing is called LIFT.  Like most previous gadgets, it is very easy to work with.  It is necessary to connect the charger to the network, and place the smart watch, for example, Apple Watch, on the levitating module.  As in the other cases, the device will begin to rotate.  So here is a double benefit - you can admire the clock, charging them.  When the system detects the presence of a device, the backlight comes on, which makes the system even more interesting. <br><br><h3>  Levitating Nixie Clock </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e8f/c79/3a4/e8fc793a4b95bfe5b1c5803f965ee71a.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  And, finally, a levitating lamp clock from Scottish developers.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating watches of this type appeared long ago, but only last year the team was able to launch a campaign to raise funds for these watches <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lasermad/time-flies-levitating-nixie-clock">on Kickstarter</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1IftoBtdytI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The clock does not rotate, for which a special stabilization system is used.  If desired, you can scroll through them manually, as shown in the video above.  Inside the base is a battery that supports the entire structure in the air in the event of a power outage.  The system can work for years, in any case, so say its creators.  The cost is about $ 300. <br><br><h3>  Hours with a levitating arrow of Story </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQ_E81_hJjU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Flyte, one of whose products, the light bulb, was shown above, recently introduced one more thing.  This is a watch with a levitating hand that hovers in the air, simultaneously moving along the dial. <br><br>  The diameter of the disk - 26.8 centimeters.  The dial material is wood.  Interestingly, the ball remains at the same distance from the disk, regardless of its inclination.  That is, you can put the clock on the table or hang it on the wall - it will show the time in both cases. <br><br>  In total, the watch has several different modes of operation.  The first is to display the hour course of time.  The second mode, "Journey", tracks important events for the owner.  For example, a watch can measure the time remaining until the end of the university or moving to another country. <br><br>  The dial, in addition to the metal ball - arrow, is also equipped with a customizable backlight with a miniature digital display.  These watches are ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, their functions are controlled using a mobile application.  The cost of hours for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flyte/story-the-levitating-timepiece">Kickstarter</a> backers is $ 349. <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402967/</a></p>
