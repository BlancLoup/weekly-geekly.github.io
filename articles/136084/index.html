  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Demotivation in full, or why am I waiting for the end of the world?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Low bow to Habranarod! <br><br><h5>  Foreword </h5><br>  We all read a lot and even read an article on how to improve performance, efficiency and another thing, sorry - garbage. <br><br>  Fasting is NOT for those who are doing well, at least it seems that everything is fine, eg.  righteous - do not read. <br>  Fasting could also be called ‚Äúreal recommendations for‚Äú get a grip on yourself, finally ‚Äù.‚Äù <br>  Do not believe those who write about efficiency, ‚Äúit's time to start learning to play the guitar,‚Äù ‚Äúfind the energy to do this, other ...‚Äù, this is all ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù, in a couple of days everything will be the same again.  Try to find a solution yourself. <br>  The ‚Äúitems‚Äù are randomized, and the introduction is enough, just read the post, try to find something useful for yourself (you will definitely find it). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Add to favorites </h4><br>  We all love to read, this is true, because without reading, without studying, we cannot find a good job, and not only, we are IT specialists (programmers, testers, administrators, start-ups (?), ...), we are always developing, we dig deeper, we are on the road becoming hackers, we are hackers, just nobody knows about it (note: a hacker is not used in the sense of a cracker).  There were times when we read tons of technical literature, we were interested in assembler, we liked to optimize the code to its fullest, we liked to prove theorems, ask ourselves ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù, etc.  Habr has become another habitat.  Now, if you need to learn, say, algorithms, besides the fact that we take / download thick books, we also keep (read - bookmark) articles from the blog "Algorithms" in Habr√©.  If you work in an ‚Äúordinary‚Äù programmer's office, you spend 8 hours a day on work, trying to devote as much time as possible only to work, and when you reach home, opening Habr, you see a lot of juicy and interesting articles.  According to statistics (I did not collect any statistics, it just sounds better) <b>80% of the actions for reading an article end with the button ‚ÄúAdd to Favorites‚Äù.</b>  You can ‚Äúadd to favorites‚Äù (or browser bookmark), or even - you need to rename it to <b>‚ÄúRead it later</b> . <b>‚Äù</b>  Question - when then?  <b>What does it mean then?</b>  Then - tomorrow, then - at the weekend, then - during the holidays, then - in the bunker?  How many of you have read all posts / articles / something on the page marked by your favorites?  Just do not need outraged comments, they say - this is what you do not read, I always read here, I don‚Äôt even need to add to favorites.  Did you meet something like this?  Council?  There is no advice, it is a reality - accept it.  But there is a loophole, and in general, if something does not work out in a direct way once, it will never work out, but there is always a loophole.  <b>Find the bug and hack the problem</b> .  The bug is that we can simply not add to favorites for some time, say two or three days, and if after two or three days we forget about posts / ..., then we don‚Äôt have to read.  In short, then - if in any way you will not read, then why add to favorites?  At the same time, some part of the consciousness will be released, the part that remembers that there are several unread "messages" in the elect. <br>  <i>Note: ‚Äúadd to favorites‚Äù can be used not in the literal sense, that is, buying new interesting and useful books without reading the previous ones - there is also ‚Äúadd to favorites‚Äù, or a growing number of items in the task manager without performing previous tasks - also "Add to favorites"</i> .

    <h4>  Too much information </h4><br>  Have you ever had a need to study some new or relatively new sphere for you, say, artificial intelligence?  Suppose you decide to do a tight AI.  What we are doing and what the righteous is doing is he who will sooner or later reach the goal (will study the AI ‚Äã‚Äãsufficiently). <br><br><h5>  we </h5>  If you have enough money, go to the bookstore and buy as many books as you can if you have X amount of money in your pocket.  We go to the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù (although these expressions are no longer relevant, since we seldom leave the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù at all) and begin to look at trackers, book sites, etc., we download a huge number of books.  The book is "long", you must first briefly familiarize yourself with the topic, go to Wikipedia or other specialized resources (AI Habr's blog).  We find a lot, well, a lot of interesting articles, in the Wiki we accidentally click on the category ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù at the bottom of the first article and see even more articles, about Mein Goth!  After a couple of three hours or days on hard accumulates well, just a huge number of books and articles.  We ask ourselves, maybe it would be better to start with some video lessons there?  Well, as I had not thought before, in general, the search for the corresponding video lessons begins - there is no longer any space on the disk.  And so on.  <b>It takes a day, two, a week, a month, we still do not begin to study, and spend all our free time looking at "where to start"?</b> <br><br><h5>  Righteous </h5>  Goes to Amazon, finds (in a few minutes, not more) a book with the best reviews / rating.  Downloads / buys.  Starts to read.  Only this book.  Then another, after he finished the first.  <b>And so on, a day, two, three, a week, a month passes, the righteous already freely ‚Äúshakes‚Äù the topic.</b> <br>  <i>Moral: you don't understand anything yet?</i> <br><br><h4>  Just do it! </h4><br>  Enough planning, long discussions, breaks, checking emails, answering sms, choosing the perfect track in the player for work, watching the next Dexter series, House, the Big Bang or whatever.  Start working, just take the task, do it, do not work in the multi-tasking mode, but execute one by one.  Give up reading the post, start right now, do not be distracted, but start at last. <br><br><h4>  8 hours of life </h4><br>  ‚ÄúAccording to the standard‚Äù, we spend 8 hours a day in the office, in reality there is still an hour for lunch, an hour and more on the way to the office and back.  You need to sleep at least 6 hours (but I want more).  In general, there is almost no free time.  Office life, the office takes us 8+ hours a day for some fee.  We are corrupt, we sell ourselves, we are no better than call girls.  Well, of course, you can support your family, go to rest in good places, build a good future, climb the career ladder.  Well what I told you, the post is NOT for the righteous.  We want, no, we just have to do what we love (oh, I envy you if the project you work on is your favorite business).  I know I know, money is needed (their mother).  Come up with something, a business, a favorite thing, a way of life, and not earnings. <br><br><h4>  Startup, I want my startup </h4><br>  Are you seriously?  What have you not grown?  Are you not ashamed?  If not, read on.  You have an idea, everybody has it.  An idea to pick up a girl, an idea to make a beautiful table, or did we talk about startups?  Suppose you have a great idea, <b>remember, it is all great.</b>  Many people scoff when you talk about making money on your idea, creating a startup according to your idea.  You do not listen to them.  And right!  Do what you like, create a startup ... and fail!  And now about how we create a startup and how it is created by the righteous. <br><br><h5>  we </h5>  We find an idea, we want to learn about startups a little information (theory, success story, etc.), we find the top 10 books that every startup has to read (we accidentally call ourselves startups, hehe).  <b>Guy Kawasaki, Startup, the</b> book is just a bomb, we read in one breath, after reading half of it, suddenly there is an idea to write down notes, we start over, looking to write what you need to know by heart.  After a couple of pages, the desire disappears, we continue to read the book (we stopped at half).  The book is just super, I want to start writing a site.  What?  Is there another book?  Which one?  <b>Rework from 37signals?</b>  Ok, I read.  Oo mine goth book vasche.  We‚Äôve got a week behind, we take on architecture, what's the architecture there, they said ‚Äújust do it‚Äù!  Okay, let's read a couple of articles from Habr about start-ups, hmmm, internally, ‚Äúadd to favorites‚Äù (and here you already understood ‚Äúoooh shit‚Äù).  We read success stories, Google, Amazon, Ebay, Apple, Facebook, Dropbox, ... all are so different and similar at the same time, and so exciting, "started as a diploma," "wrote the first version on the bus," "had not a penny," " refused to sell ‚Äù,‚Äú refused to buy ‚Äù, ... You are firmly deciding not to sell your startup ever.  Uh, sorry, what kind of startup?  And they remembered, we have not started yet.  So, go ahead.  If you click on this button, the ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù page opens, there is my photo <b>(I'm the CEO, bitch!)</b> , I give interviews to well-known channels, they write about me in magazines, I have my own storytelling story‚Ä¶ damn, I‚Äôve overclocked .  So, push this button, opens ....?  I'll check the mail ... <br>  So, a startup should not generate income, but help people, how can my idea help people?  (and here there are various legends about how our startup helps people, but subconsciously we know, it‚Äôs just for fame and making money, again hehe). <br><br><h5>  Righteous </h5> Startup Weekend?  This is for show off.  Sachs story?  Then, everyone already knows how it happened with Google, Facebook, ....  Architecture, no ‚Äúwell-established‚Äù features, just what is needed.  The project will take, now we will count ... about 6 months, we will write down a year and a half.  We do not lose motivation, do not fly in the clouds.  What kind of marketing, I don‚Äôt even have a product, when I will, then let's talk ... <br>  <i>Moral: what, really do not understand?</i> <br><br><h4>  Social media </h4><br>  ‚ÄúRefresh‚Äù, ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù, ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù ... So ad infinitum (until the eyes close themselves and need to sleep).  As we spend our free time, we undertake reading, we write the code, we develop our project slowly.  Everything is grabbed, everything is fine.  For the last time - the post is NOT for the righteous. <br>  Well, open Habr, many interesting articles, the resource is truly unique!  Yeah, it's over.  "Refresh".  We open a ‚Äúsocial network‚Äù (Facebook, VKontakte, Odnoklassniki (?), ...), messages, notifications, tape, ... ‚ÄúRefresh‚Äù.  Yes, someone like my "sheir", liked.  Let's write a smart comment.  "Refresh".  (Habr is open in the adjacent tab).  We go to Habr.  "Refresh".  "A new version has been released ....".  Second to two.  We read the comments.  Oh, someone wrote a joke, he has +56, I'll write something and I will.  "Refresh".  Minus?  For what?  There is an answer with sarcasm, the war has begun.  (30 minutes later).  Here is a nerd.  "Refresh".  We go to the social network.  "Refresh".  In Habr.  "Refresh".  Newly posted post, no comments.  I will write ‚ÄúThank you, excellent article‚Äù, I will receive pluses 5. ‚ÄúRefresh‚Äù.  And so every day ... <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  In general, I will be brief, many people will not like the post, and maybe vice versa.  According to your reaction, I understand whether you need to continue the topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136084/</a></p>
