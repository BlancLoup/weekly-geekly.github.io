Part one.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2>  A fairy tale lies, yes there is a hint in it! </h2><br>  In the thirtieth kingdom, in the thirtieth state, in the city of Muscovy, in the village of Green, which proudly called itself Green, it lived, there was one good young man.  His name was ... Well, let's say Mstislav.  Mstislav learned from the wise man known, together with his friends, so that in the future, by playing his tambourine from demonic machines, expel the sickness, and earn money for honey and beer.  It goes like that Mstislavushka on the way, tramples trample down.  And a <s>fellow student,</s> one of his friends, flies past him on a black horse.  And she thinks our good fellow: ‚ÄúAnd then I‚Äôm walking and caving, sandals trampling.  Tea man, I'm not stupid, surely I will not earn a horse? ‚Äù <br>  And Mstislav decided to find a job for himself.  A man, he really was not stupid, he was often set as an example to others as a magician for his understanding.  (Well, my reader needs to make a reservation. Mstislav‚Äôs co-option was of a special nature. He was confused about what a magic potion is all the time. ) <a name="habracut"></a>  And he decided to get a job in the studio, where the masters were all-wise and it was called strangely: ‚ÄúA full cycle advertising agency‚Äù He comes to this studio like that, and says: ‚ÄúLook, you‚Äôve seen a good fellow looking for a written handsome man. "And the director is immortal to him and answers:" We are looking for, yes, such that he knew how to cope with a gray wolf-bitrix, and was able to use a photo-psalter, but he had a self-installation tablecloth and if the wolf's foot is sore, but the jaw falls off, you could cure it.  And as a true good fellow, you should be drunk, and weed ‚Äúsmoke‚Äù from the island of ‚ÄúBuyan‚Äù.  A good fellow scratched his unshaven turnip, and says: ‚ÄúWell, you don‚Äôt know how to do it, you have a good schedule - you just have to stand for a day, and hold out for the night.‚Äù  Since then, a good young man has become a <s>Koschey</s> Director - an immortal to work.  He dragged for him bulk apples of dubious freshness, he treated half-dead wolves, and sometimes even died.  Tablecloth self-service fed the entire regiment of the host.  In general, the work was not to say that it was very hard, they paid for it in general, not bad, it did not distract much from studying at the sorcerer, but something tormented the heart of our hero ... </div>
