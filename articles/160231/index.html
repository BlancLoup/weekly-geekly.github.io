  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Voynushka local scale, but with the strategy and mission, or test management for top managers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  At dawn, the fishermen of the Lovi-Fish-Na-Spear tribe lined up on the outskirts of the village.  The gloomy faces were painted in a fighting manner, the teeth were blackened, the nets were darned, the spears were ground and decorated with the most beautiful ostrich feathers.  Eucalyptus leaf gum pleasantly invigorated tongues and masked odors. <br>  - Wait for me, !!!, - the priest ran up to the circle, shaking a pack of parchments. <br>  ‚ÄúYou forgot everything again!‚Äù, Wiping off a skirt of leaves from a coconut palm last year, the priest tried to slip one of the pieces in a circle.  The boy shuddered, and he retreated a step. <br>  - Here, this is a strategy.  Here it is drawn, where you should spear fish, and where then put the prey.  And what feathers to label it, then to distribute to all according to merit.  And how to carry her home.  And what kind of fish do we need!  And this, - the priest pulled out a separate sheet, especially painted and with drawings - that‚Äôs the Mission.  Hang it on the most important spear - the leader !!!  You need to know for what you are going for the fish !!!  Awww ... <br>  There was a slight knock, and the priest sat sideways to the foot of the palm tree.  The leader hid the club behind his back. <br>  - One more case of severe Bingo-Bulshit.  You and you, - showed two from the side, - return him to the witch, let him treat his pupil.  Chase us later. <br>  Two separated, picked up the priest.  The leader twisted spear parchment. <br>  - Let's see what he dragged.  How to heal wounds ... how to cook and save food ... Bay cards with fish places - return the sorcerer to the library.  The rest will burn.  Yes, throw this stuff already, also get infected, I suppose I did it myself, the parchments have not dried yet.  Everything, we move.  The fish will not wait.  ... </blockquote><br><br>  Recently, as head of the testing department, I had to create a couple of useless documents.  The chief with a suspicious gleam in his eyes demanded that the department have a mission, and a strategy was developed.  Having dismissed the miraculous vision in which the chief and the attack on the neighbors by the whole department appeared, she made a sample of test plans for him, accompanied by an explanatory note in which she wrote down the extent and depending on what she decided what to include in the tests and where perform.  The mission of the department has since been hanging in a beautiful frame, once a year we print it again, changing the date.  He didn‚Äôt have any more questions, and no one asked to update these documents themselves.  Although it is clear that the decision on the amount of testing is taken every time a new version is rolled out, and it depends on many things, and the version is put from 3 to 20 times a week. <br><br>  But I still want to find out what documents are needed inside the testing department, and they bring benefits and which are the external interface of the department, which is also necessary, but the costs of creating and updating them do not give anything to the product, the quality of the product, and, therefore, its users. . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Test plan needed?  And then.  Detailing, format, depth depends on the project, but the fact of availability and constant reconciliation with a list of requirements is important.  Through the test plan, a top view is provided, a guarantee that none of the most important functions of the product will be forgotten.  When you are asked <s>where your network stores, baits and spears</s> , what exactly are you testing, what is automated, what is not yet, what requirements are covered by tests, and which are not, the answer will be here.

      Testing Summary Report needed?  Certainly, with an unambiguous identification of versions that have been tested, with a list of errors, sorted by the severity of the problems, with their separation by product components.  Find out <s>where the fish died, why the strongest hunter tupit and why the catch</s> will be <s>reduced by</s> reading this report. <br><br>  But Strategy and Mission are documents that are contrived, lowered from above, inspired by military approaches that are relevant in the struggle between companies, but not between departments.  Their value to the work of the testing department is zero. <br><br>  The only thing these documents are suitable for is to create an image of the department in the eyes of the management.  Also the necessary part of the work of the head.  There will always be something to shake and point to the great Mission of your department, without which the company will fall into pieces.  And it‚Äôs not so important that you write there - it‚Äôs still a sheet for another Bushgo Bingo series.  Often managers who like to play like to play it, under the pretext that they do not understand what your department is doing.  They do not want to read into the documents that are in the department.  Or pretend they do not want.  What is also a sign from above - it's time to change the place of fishing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160231/</a></p>
