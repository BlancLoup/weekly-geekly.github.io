We hear so often that we decided to answer it once and for all and write a small post containing some of our recommendations on the proper use of videos for promoting IT products. <br><br>  This post will be useful to those who have a product that is sold online, there is a video about the product and a desire to increase sales with the help of this video.

      So, what to do with the video, so that it is useful, and not lying dead weight? <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/172715/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d4/3b6/fda/0d43b6fda2259b2d573101122c57030a.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  The benefits of the video </h2><br>  To begin with, let's look at how videos can benefit: <br><br><h5>  1. Passive: work with visitors already attracted to your page. </h5><br>  The video posted on the product page attracts attention, talks about the product, sells the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe product, motivates to try the product and ultimately increases the conversion.  In addition, the video increases the average duration of a page visit. <br><br><h5>  2. Active: attracting new visitors to your page from search engines. </h5><br>  The main goal of the video in this case is to index the search engines correctly and get to the first page of the search results.  Tambneyl video stands out among other results of search results, so even if the video is at the very bottom of the page, it is well attracted the attention of users. <br><br>  By the way, due to the relatively small competition among the videos, sometimes you can easily get through to the first page of the search results for very ‚Äújuicy‚Äù keywords. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An example of how our video appeared on the first page for the query ‚Äúonline translation service‚Äù</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eaf/bb6/8ae/eafbb68aebc2dcae9053b8e7beab91db.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Please note that our site ( <a href="http://alconost.com/">http://alconost.com</a> ) is not on the first page, but there is a video. <br></div></div><br>  So, now it is clear that we want from the video, it remains to figure out how to achieve this. <br><br><h2>  Video hosting </h2><br>  To begin with, decide where you will ‚Äústore‚Äù your video: on your own server or on third-party video hosting services (Youtube, Vimeo, etc.).  It seems to us that there are no advantages to posting videos on your server: Youtube will provide not only a wide payback channel and no brakes, but also various social ‚Äúbuns‚Äù, for example, likes, comments, the ability to quickly share videos, subscribe to a channel, etc. . <br><br>  If for some reason you decide to host the video on your server - make sure that you have enough capacity to ensure the normal download speed of the video with a large number of visitors to the site.  There is nothing worse than a slow loading video.  Only the most persistent viewer will see it through to the end, the majority of users will leave the ‚Äúbraking‚Äù site. <br><br><h2>  Page design </h2><br>  The faster the visitor notices the video on your page, the better!  Make a large, well-visible splashscreen with the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù icon, do not force the user to make an effort to find your video. <br><br>  The ideal scenario of user behavior on your page is as follows: I saw the logo and the name of the product ‚Üí I read the definition of the product (one or two lines) ‚Üí I noticed a video clip, I was glad that I didn‚Äôt have to spend time and energy reading the text and clicked on ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Good design example</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/497/c41/1b2/497c411b2cc6197db1dfaec114b6c6eb.png"><br><br>  By the way, it is specifically in this case that the solution I used is excellent: after clicking on the icon, the page is darkened, a window pops up with the video playing, and under the window there is a large green button ‚ÄúTry it for free‚Äù.  The viewer simply has nothing more to do except to close the video or click on ‚Äútry me‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac5/9e6/7a7/ac59e67a75613e217d433d7a3cc2fe44.png"><br></div></div><br>  An important point: the elements of call to action (‚Äúbuy‚Äù, ‚Äúdownload‚Äù, ‚Äúregister‚Äù buttons) should be located directly next to the video and be its logical continuation.  Understanding should come to the viewer by itself that after watching a video, it‚Äôs customary to click on ‚Äúdownload‚Äù and there‚Äôs just no other option. <br><br>  And this technique works well: show the CTA button in the last scene, show an accentuated mouse click on this button, place the exact same button next to the roller, and the viewer will have a desire to repeat the action he has just seen. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Example CTA button in the video</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZ_eNGAENtg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br><h2>  Video Sitemap </h2><br>  <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26answer%3D80472%26topic%3D10079%26ctx%3Dtopic">VideoSiteMap</a> is an xml file on your server that transmits information about the video content of your site to the search engine.  Surprisingly, 8 out of 10 of our customers ordering videos do not know what a video mapping is, and therefore do not use it for promotion. <br><br>  If the video is placed on your server, then video sitemap is the only way to tell the search engine about your video; without it, the video will not be included in the search results.  In addition to the technical information about the video file, the video sitemap contains the name of the video, its description, tags.  Be sure to use in these fields the keywords for which you want to get into the result of search results. <br><br><h2>  Youtube promotion </h2><br>  Position in the search results of your video posted on Youtube depends on the factors: <br><br><ul><li>  keywords in title, description and video tags; </li><li>  average video viewing time; </li><li>  the number of views and comments from the video and the channel as a whole; </li><li>  the number of subscribers to the channel; </li><li>  age of the video, age of the channel; </li><li>  the number of "likes", comments, additions to playlists, complaints, video inserts on other sites; </li><li>  the number of external links to the video. </li></ul><br>  This is not an exhaustive list, but it is with these factors that you should start working and look at the result. <br><br><h2>  Keywords </h2><br>  Use keywords in the title, in the description (at least twice) and in video tags. <br>  There are keywords that relate only to video and cannot be found using conventional keyword selection tools.  Therefore, when selecting keywords, it is necessary to use not only the familiar Google Keyword Tool and Yandex Wordstat, but also to check all the results using the <a href="https://ads.youtube.com/keyword_tool">Youtube Keyword Tool</a> . <br><br>  Tip: put a link to your page in the first 150 characters of the video description.  According to statistics, 6% of viewers pass by it. <br><br><h2>  Average time watching movie </h2><br>  A small average viewing time and a high bounce rate (when users close the page almost immediately) is a very serious ‚Äúsin‚Äù in Google‚Äôs eyes.  This suggests that the video is either useless, or uninteresting, or irrelevant to keywords.  The chance to get on the first page of search results in such videos is low. <br><br>  Use only relevant keywords, and by all means try to keep the viewer longer on the page.  For example, try starting a discussion in the comments. <br><br>  And try not to make long videos.  The ideal length of the video is: 90-120 seconds for a detailed marketing video and 30-45 seconds for a short video how to.  Such videos do not have time to bother the viewer, videos are viewed in full, the pages do not close ahead of time, Google is happy, the video rating is growing. <br><br><h2>  Video distribution </h2><br>  For a video to have a high rating, it must have many views, comments, subscribers, etc.  To do this, distribute the video on all your channels: <br><br><ul><li>  email distribution (video cannot be remarked into a letter, but you can insert an image imitating a YouTube player window with a large ‚Äúplay‚Äù button); </li><li>  press release (of course, if you think that the topic will be of interest to editors); </li><li>  posts from video on blogs, forums; </li><li>  social networks and twitter; </li><li>  video response to a popular video on your subject. </li></ul><br><h2>  Cheat views </h2><br>  An alternative to natural advancement is the number of views and subscribers cheat services.  We recommend using them only in extreme cases and be very careful: Google requires that all promotion (including video) be natural, so you can get banned for too aggressive browsing. <br><br>  These recommendations do not guarantee 100% success, but at least you can start with them, and then evaluate the result and draw the appropriate conclusions.  If we have missed something, and you have your own ways to increase sales with the help of videos - welcome to the comments. <br><br><br>  <b>about the author</b> <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dvideo-marketing-howto">localization of applications, games and websites</a> in 60 languages.
