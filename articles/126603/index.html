      Book: The Procrastination Equation, Pierce Steele (Psychologist), 2011 <br><br>  <a href="http://www.procrastinus.com/">www.procrastinus.com</a> <br><br>  Perfectionism does not lead to procrastination - it is well studied.  Procrastination is the result of impulsiveness.  Self-control and postponement of satisfaction are key to managing procrastination. <br>  Procrastinating suffer from: <br><ul><li>  poor control of impulsivity </li><li>  lack of constancy </li><li>  lack of labor discipline </li><li>  lack of management skills </li><li>  inability to work methodically </li></ul><br><br>  Motivation can be modeled using the following dependency: <br>  (expectations * value) / (impulsiveness * delays) <br><br>  Impulsiveness is moderated by the prefrontal cortex.  People with damage can be noticeably impulsive. <br><br>  The temptation is the victory of impulse control <br><br>  Modern society offers more sources of temptation. <br>  Hope - optimism, expectation of success <br><ul><li>  too much pessimism causes procrastination (low expectation of success keeps us from starting a business) </li><li>  too much optimism, too, causes procrastination (an unrealistic feeling of easy accomplishment makes you put off the beginning of the case until the last second) </li></ul><br><br>  Methods of enhancing optimism: <br><ul><li>  spirals of success - a series of achievements will add confidence (an example of technology: earning scout badges) </li><li>  someone else's victory - reading other people's success stories, searching for inspirational books, films, people, joining a community where there are such people </li><li>  fulfillment of desires - visualization of success and subsequent analysis of your current state </li><li>  Prepare for the worst, hope for the best - develop recovery strategies in the event of a return to old habits.  Predict the appearance of temptations and find ways to combat them in advance. </li></ul><br><br>  Subjective value of the task <br><ul><li>  create chains of goals that connect unpleasant tasks with pleasant ones </li><li>  formulate goals positively, avoid negatives </li><li>  turn tasks into a game - get bored </li><li>  bring meaning to the task by linking it to goals </li><li>  study the schedule of your efficiency spikes and plan with this in mind </li><li>  clearly define in your schedule time for physical education and sleep </li><li>  do not forget to eat too - hunger has not helped anyone yet </li><li>  make it so that you fall asleep at a predicted time, get ready for bed </li><li>  don't ignore your limits </li><li>  To fight against dropping cases, understand in time that the task scares you and break it into small tasks until each subtask looks harmless. </li><li>  reward yourself for completing tasks </li></ul><br><br>  Impulsiveness <br><ul><li>  recognize the temptations and eliminate them to a safe distance </li><li>  satisfy your needs before they distract you from work </li><li>  plan out how you will be entertained - work better knowing what kind of rest awaits you </li><li>  create a system of fines for distraction </li><li>  mentally process the temptations so that they seem something dirty, unattractive </li><li>  get rid of the points of temptation </li></ul><br><br>  Criticizes KISS goals (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time bound) <br><ul><li>  the concept of "secrecy" is unnecessary if the goal is measurable and time bound </li><li>  ‚ÄúReachability‚Äù is superfluous if the goal is realistic </li><li>  key principles in this principle overlooked </li></ul><br><br>  Instead, goals should be <br><ul><li>  challenge you (expectations are not too high or low) </li><li>  make sense </li><li>  formulated in special words so that you will understand when you reach the goal and what you need to do to do it </li><li>  long-term goals should be broken into short-term </li><li>  organized in such a mode of the day, when things are done at the same time and in one place </li></ul><br><br><br><h4>  user abcd_f </h4><br><br>  Yeah, you're not alone :) <br><br>  In fact, this is a fairly typical problem for people working alone and without customer feedback.  Things like spending a day to decide what to call a temporary variable is the scourge of a lone programmer.  The next time you start a new project, make sure that you have someone who will support you or a fan of the project.  If there are more, it is good, but even one is enough.  This will create the feeling that you are obliged to someone, and it will greatly help to bring the planned stages to the end ... By the way, about the planned stages: this is one more thing that you should definitely have.  This allows you to break out of the vicious circle of enthusiasm for details that do not matter (because of which you exhaust the mind) and keep a broad view of the project throughout the entire time.  For example, knowing that your project will be written on the blog in two weeks, you will not only release the beta versions at its best (which usually lasted for decades :)), but also added a project site.  Productivity immediately increases by orders of magnitude. <br><br>  If we talk about the methods of self-development and all that, the most useful thing is the recording of thoughts.  Suppose you are working on a project and are currently dealing with function A from module B of the web interface, which in turn is only a small part of the entire project.  And then you will realize that there is one more thing that absolutely must be done.  ¬∑ Record it!  Throwing it out of his head on paper helps to free up the idle bars that the brain will perform, worrying about not forgetting this thought.  There is a big, very commercialized theory built on the basis of this simple idea - GTD, but this is all rubbish.  Just download Things for iPhone and that should be enough. <br><br>  So, yes ... I understand you, and (a) this is quite a common thing (b) you must follow the goals you have undertaken.  That's all. <br><br>  (Update) If you are considering taking chemicals, do not do it.  If you are really desperate, try modafinil.  Very rarely, once a month, only to start a surge in productivity and make things go forward. <br><br><br><h4>  hasenj </h4><br><br>  So I feel the same way. <br>  I also like starting projects more than completing them. <br><br>  I think writing down your ideas will help fix them.  My experience says that the more I write about my ideas, the greater the chance that they are crowned with success. <br>  see: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/discover.html">www.paulgraham.com/discover.html</a> <br><br>  This is not a completely new idea, but I believe that only a certain type of people has such a problem. <br><br>  You are the person who likes to start projects more than complete them.  This is due to how your brain works.  Not all people are such, some prefer to finish projects, and this is not related to the acquired discipline. <br><br>  If you are like me, your ideas may seem fragmented, you jump from one idea to another, one day you think: ‚ÄúMaine, wouldn't it be cool to build an application that makes X!‚Äù Then, two days later, you you feel that the idea has bored you and you want to engage in other ideas.  Coming up with different ideas is unusually interesting, so you feel a little exhausted if you spend a lot of time on one idea. <br><br>  When your ideas are fragmented, you may need to work on bringing them to mind.  It is best to either write about them or discuss them with other people.  If you are an introvert, it will probably be easier for you to write about them. <br><br>  The next issue may be controversial, but if you like to start projects more than complete them, your personality may be xNTP on the Myers-Briggs indicator, which means that you are ‚Äúextrovert intuit‚Äù [0].  In general, this means the same thing that I said above: your ideas are everywhere, only when you voice them, they are fixed and take shape. <br>  [0] <a href="http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Extraverted_Intuit">greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Extraverted_Intuit</a> ... <br><br><br><h4>  user dstein </h4><br><br>  I bought myself a board and markers.  On it, I write down all the tasks (large and small) and the stages of the completion of my project.  The board reflects all the changes, it is clear that the project is growing and modifying. <br><br>  I also had a thrill while starting a new project, because it was still only a dream, although it could be achieved.  Probably, cognitive science can explain this, dopamine level and so on ... And when the project starts to tighten, you do not get the same dopamine surge, you want to open a new project to smoke again. <br>  What you need to do is learn to get the thrill of completing the stages.  The ability to cross out one of the tasks on the board makes you feel awfully good. <br><br>  I haven‚Äôt erasing deleted tasks off the board for a while, as I believe that the thrill of completing cases lasts for a while and motivates me to continue to finish things and cross them out. <br><br><br><h4>  user mz </h4><br><br>  A year on the verge of death performed a miracle with my neurotic delusions.  I certainly do not recommend trying it.  But I would recommend you watch the movie ‚ÄúOutside of Rangoon‚Äù, and then go and work as a volunteer, say, at a shelter for the homeless or with chronically ill people or something that really touches some levers on you.  Or at least sign up for emails for people with incurable diseases. <br><br>  Also, think about vitamin therapy.  Perhaps the problem is related to the chemistry of the brain and it can be cured with proper nutrition. <br>  Good luck! <br><br><br><h4>  user azulum </h4><br><br>  I understand you, brother.  I am almost in the same predicament, although I have just lost my job ... Happy days, mdya ... Focus strongly on one thing, but still allow yourself time to unload from the thoughts.  Don't let other ideas distract you, just save them for later.  Finish one thing.  A thing you love and you can be proud of.  And share it with others, especially the details of creation.  Find someone who is attentive to details, who will help you, who believes in what you are doing, even if you are a good specialist.  The one who will help you develop a plan for your ideal product, reduce it to an acceptable size. What I learned exactly about software, job search and parenting is that these things can never be completed.  For me, a perfectionist like you, this is a bitter pill.  There is always frustration, but I don‚Äôt think that something substantial can be done without disappointment.  And people who are not disappointed will probably never change anything (although the suicide rate will be lower).  Life is hard.  Three years after graduation, I went from bad to worse.  Don't blame yourself for not graduating from college.  I thought that in an educational institution I would gain the knowledge sufficient to at least put food on the table and pay for a mortgage, however I find myself doing the same things (and even worse) as before admission to the university.  Education is getting worse and worse. <br><br>  Now I give specific advice (although it is easy to give advice): I ask the help of those few who believe in me.  Here is an episode of the podcast on the topic - <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/7">5by5.tv/b2w/7</a> , it will not help to finish things, but will make you think. <br><br>  As for medication methods, I was diagnosed with depression and it ended up finding vitamin D deficiency. By the way, yoga helps. <br><br>  Here at HN, they like Mike Lee ( <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Making-Apps-That-Dont-Suc">www.infoq.com/presentations/Making-Apps-That-Dont-Suc</a> ...), in which he talks about how he sold everything to work on the project for a year without payment.  So if none of my advice is right for you, do something crazy to help you go in your chosen direction. <br><br><br><h4>  user albinothug </h4><br><br>  James Altcher blog.  <a href="http://www.altucherconfidential.com/">www.altucherconfidential.com</a> <br>  Also, read Toro and Emerson. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126603/</a></p>
