  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Guitar, computer, live (part 2: Guitar Rig4)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Continuing the theme on the choice of software for playing the guitar through a computer at rehearsals and on stage.  The first part is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/sound_and_music/127950">here</a> .  And the next one is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/sound_and_music/128093/">here</a> . <br><br>  The second monitored program, Guitar Rig 4, is also from the ‚Äúfor the smallest‚Äù series, although in many respects it greatly benefits Amplitube 3, which I wrote a little earlier. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The interface of the three buttons is simple and clear: switch between preset selection mode, effect selection, and settings. <br><br>  In the mode of selecting effects, which, by the way, are much larger here than in Amplitube 3 and which are much more diverse, on the left we see the effects themselves in the list, and on the right - some rivers in which we can safely manage everything we want.  Very often I find myself searching for a button that would unfold rivers on its reverse side, as in Reason, but alas, it is not here.

    <img src="http://i.minus.com/ibdcHEJIcSKuOo.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is worth noting that we can save any number of options for setting up an individual FX and call them at any time from the menu in the bottom left corner.  This is actually quite a useful feature and I recommend using it as often as possible. <br><br>  But, what's the point of describing the effects - let's talk about midi: to assign a signal to the midi controller, we need to right-click on the controller and select ‚ÄúLearn‚Äù, then pull the hardware keys. <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/ib00CAYNl8AKmY.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And to see what and where we assigned, you can select ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúController‚Äù in the top left menu. <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/iuawJXKSpPpVn.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Here we can also select the range to which the controller will respond, which is sufficiently necessary for the volume or quunk pedals. <br><br>  By the way, only in this menu we can assign switching between presets to buttons.  For this you need to act as in the picture below: <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/iboSzX7q0YhPuB.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is worth noting that the mechanism for switching between presets is implemented by a tag system. <br>  The presets themselves can be found under the mysterious Browser menu item. <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/iF9J5PyirtRuj.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And to add a new tag is very simple: right-click into the free space and select the item: ‚ÄúCreate a new tag‚Äù.  After that you just need to drag the selected songs to this tag. <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/ibsYTRgKOnSz24.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And it is according to the list formed inside the tag that the switching will take place when clicking ‚ÄúNext Preset‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrev.  Preset. <br><br>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the possibility of customizing Master FX - this is a separate module, in which you can add any number of effects and which will affect all presets during this session. <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/ibx8jbgkQeDP18.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This is extremely important at rehearsals and concerts to adjust the sound suitable for this room: you can adjust the equalizer, reverb or even add a guitar amplifier depending on the conditions and equipment.  The most important thing is that you do not need to patch all the presets.  And it is really very convenient. <br><br>  Among other things, in Gitar Rig there is a so-called Live Mod, in which all effects are hidden and we see only the list of songs for this tag and the Rig Kontrol controller, which, if we don‚Äôt have the same iron controller, we did not give up. <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/ioMbcoDUGnfgx.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The global disadvantage of the program is the inability to set up ‚Äúglobal‚Äù midi commands that will be the same not only for one preset, but for the entire session. <br>  Thus, switching between presets must be configured separately in each track. <br><br>  Also, the downside is the inability to connect external vst, which very well expand the capabilities of any program. <br><br>  That's basically all you need to know about Guitar Rig in terms of its concert and rehearsal possibilities. <br><br>  In fact, these programs are too simple and very closely related to hardware guitar processors, which by their capabilities remained at the 2001 level.  Therefore, in the next review we will consider related solutions for concert activities. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Apparently this topic is not relevant to Habr√© and I was a little mistaken.  Further articles, in order not to clog the collective blog ‚ÄúWorking with Sound‚Äù I will publish in my personal blog. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  Made <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/sound_and_music/128093/">another</a> article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128036/</a></p>
