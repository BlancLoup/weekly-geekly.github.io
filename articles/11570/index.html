Its essence is the analysis of the market share of MP3-players of one famous brand.  However, the essence of curiosity is not that.  Along with the usual players, the report included some types of cell phones, clearly claiming some attention from music lovers. <br>  This trend is very interesting.  Cellular with MP3-ambitions, game consoles, used as Bluray-players, cameras, pushing from the shelves of the old woman Sony Handycam ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/4c1/c36/0c9/4c1c360c90a366d1c0182d5ed5c63f9b.jpg" width="450" height="459" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Fairy tale come true</strong> <br>  In general, of course, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcombining digital cameras and digital video cameras is the right one.  No, we are not talking about those hybrids that are now: not universal, capable of producing a quality result, either in the form of pictures, or in the form of records.  I mean the combine, constituting normal competition to entry-level devices (at a minimum) and completely replacing home budget video cameras (worth up to 10-13 thousand).  Once it was just a dream, but ... <br>  ... but in February 2007, Canon announced the PowerShot TX1 project.  A video camera with a standard camera matrix, optical stabilization, a large focal length range and flash cards as a carrier.  In the last and all rested, by the way.  As the experts said, the appearance of normal hybrids is inevitable - as soon as the price of flash drives with a volume of more than eight gigabytes drops below the acceptable level for the mass user. <br>  Now this price for Compact Flash has dropped to below $ 99.  At the end of May, the PowerShot TX1 project turned into a product ‚Äî an entry-level Canon video shooter TX1 video camera and entered the US stores at a price of $ 450. <br><br>  <strong><u>PowerShot TX1 Features:</u></strong> <br>  Matrix <br>  <em>CCD 1 / 2.5 ", 7.1 megapixel</em> <br>  CPU <br>  <em>DIGIC III with iSAPS technology</em> <br>  Sizes of pictures <br>  <em>3072 x 2304, 3072 x 1728 (16: 9), 2592 x 1944, 2048 x 1536, 1600 x 1200, 640 x 480</em> <br>  Video clip <br>  <em>1280 x 720 @ 30fps640 x 480 @ 30fps320 x 240 @ 60 / 30fps</em> <br>  File formats <br>  <em>JPEG Exif 2.2, DCF, DPOF, AVI Motion JPEG, WAVE</em> <br>  Optics <br>  <em>39-390mm (35mm equiv.), F3.5-5.6 optical image stabilization</em> <br>  Shooting Modes <br>  <em>Auto, Manual, Portrait, Night Snapshot, Indoor, Foliage, Snow, Beach, Aquarium, Super macro, Color accent, Color swap, Stitch assist, Special scene, Movie</em> <br>  Excerpts <br>  <em>15 - 1/2500</em> <br>  Exposure Compensation <br>  <em>¬± 2EV in 1/3 EV increments</em> <br>  Sensitivity <br>  <em>Auto, High ISO Auto, ISO 80-800</em> <br>  White balance <br>  <em>Auto, Daylight, Cloudy, Tungsten, Fluorescent, Fluorescent H, manual tuning</em> <br>  Flash <br>  <em>Auto, always on, always off, red-eye reduction, flash exposure lock, slow sync</em> <br>  Memory cards <br>  <em>SD, SDHC, MMC (MMCplus support)</em> <br>  Viewfinder <br>  <em>Not</em> <br>  Framing screen <br>  <em>1.8 inches TFT, 115,000 dots</em> <br>  Connections <br>  <em>USB 2.0 Hi-Speed, AV out (NTSC / PAL), component output for HDTV</em> <br>  Other <br>  <em>Bar graph, 2 and 10 second response delay</em>

      <strong>Super Photo</strong> <br>  Let us go directly to the tests.  First check the TX1 as a camera.  Like the latest Canon superzoom, the TX1 boasts that it can focus at a distance of 0 cm. Yes, right on the spot on the outside of the lens.  To do this, however, it is necessary to use the Super macro shooting mode - the usual macro ‚Äúworks out‚Äù distances from a meter (with a focal length of 390 mm) to 10 cm (with a focal length of 39 mm). <br>  The TX1 autofocus system works quite well for cameras of this class.  With good lighting, its speed is high, and there are practically no errors.  In the Super macro mode and when shooting indoors, the system sometimes has to make several attempts to finally focus on the desired detail. <br>  The overall quality of the TX1 images was very pleased.  Before us is a typical camera of the upper sector of the initial level with a matrix resolution of 5-8 megapixels, without any discounts on ‚Äúhybridity‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>Megavideo</strong> <br>  Making sure that as a TX1 camera is completely worthy of attention, we turn to the tests for video. <br>  Technically, shooting on the TX1 boasts a full set of necessary parameters: resolution - from compact 320 x 240 to fully satisfying HDTV format 1280 x 720, 30 frames per second - as a reasonable minimum (320x240 can be shot at 60 frames per second), stereo sound, the ability to change the focal lengths during shooting. <br>  The problems of the TX1 as a video camera stem from the fact that Canon used the coding method for their cameras in this project: Motion JPG.  As we know, this wonderful format, although it responds to the AVI extension, actually demonstrates such file sizes that are not typical for standard AVI under any circumstances. <br>  Not to be unfounded, for example, we give a table of capacity of a standard gigabyte map for various shooting modes: <br>  640 x 480 @ 30 fps - 7 min 49 sec <br>  640 x 480 @ 30 fps, low quality - 14 min 20 sec <br>  320 x 240 @ 60 fps - 10 min 5 sec <br>  320 x 240 @ 30 fps - 19 min 07 sec <br>  1280 x 720 @ 30 fps - 3 min 30 sec <br>  1280 x 720 @ 30 fps low quality - 6 min 44 sec <br>  By the way, the size of the TX recording file is also limited: it is 4 gigabytes. <br>  The recording quality of the TX1 is on the standard for modern DV home camcorders - so the new unit is quite capable of competing with this parameter.  By the way!  DV cameras for ‚Äúhome, family‚Äù are produced not only by Canon‚Äôs competitors, but also by the company itself.  Maybe that's why in her guide they decided not to give TX1 such a powerful weapon as MPEG-4 compression. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/971/ddb/004/971ddb004aae684b2316a21390dd8a8e.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Macedonian!</strong> <br>  By design, the Canon PowerShot TX1 can be attributed to ultra-compact cameras.  This is not surprising, because the progenitor of the project is the Ixus series.  Structurally, the photo camera was made very cool: a little more than a pack of cigarettes, a pleasant weight (for such sizes), silvery color.  In the decoration of the case used both plastic and metal inserts.  The lens is completely retracted into the body, the rotary screen rotates 270 degrees around its longitudinal axis. <br>  Miracles begin at the moment when you take the camera in your hands and try to take something off.  I must say, the engineers acted quite wisely by separating the functions of the photo and video into different buttons: at the top (photo) and on the side opposite to the lens (video). <br>  Designers assumed that it would be natural for the TX1 to be gripped by its right hand in the manner of a pistol grip.  In life, this is not very convenient.  Firstly, the light weight of the camera strains the muscles of one hand too much.  Secondly, the controls, though thought out quite well, but for some operations takes too much time.  Perhaps with unaccustomed. <br>  Finally, thirdly: in order to take a vertical photo (for example, a growth portrait), TX1 has to be sent to the subject of shooting ... in short, this is called ‚Äúshooting in Macedonian‚Äù to the cinema.  As you understand, not to overwhelm the horizon, "shooting" in Macedonian, is very, very hard ... <br><br>  <strong>Step made!</strong> <br>  The Canon PowerShot TX1 is the first device in history, after testing which you cannot tell which of the functions (photo or video) it has.  Basic both. <br>  As for quality.  Given that the Canon PowerShot TX1 is the cheapest HDTV camcorder on the market, we have almost no complaints about the quality.  Yes, the size of the output file makes you look for the most capacious cards, carrying them with almost handfuls.  Yes, the lightness of the body is provoked by the ‚Äústirrer‚Äù during the change of focal length - and the stabilization system is powerless here.  But: pure quality, the picture without the technical factors of the TX1 is good. <br>  Nice and photos taken by Canon PowerShot TX1.  At least in comparison with other competitors with similar capabilities (7 megapixels, 39-390 mm focal length), the brainchild of Canon looks extremely convincing.  Excellent picture clarity, small aberrations, tolerable dynamic range.  Like all compacts, the PowerShot TX1 loves nature and sunny weather, reacting extremely painfully to a lack of lighting: high ISOs make noise, and autofocus becomes extremely slow. <br>  Problems PowerShot TX1 relate not to the technical side, but to the design.  Vertical grip and the location of the buttons do not allow the user to make the necessary changes to the parameters quickly and imperceptibly for the recording results.  Of course, it is worth boasting engineers for the fact that in such a miniature size, they embodied so many useful options.  And yet - using TX1 is inconvenient.  It would be interesting, but uncomfortable. <br>  Therefore, the current model, although it is the most important step towards the unification of cameras and cameras, can in fact be considered nothing more than an interesting toy for enthusiasts.  A mass buyer should wait for the Canon PowerShot TX2. <br><br>  (Reviewed based on <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0706/07060801canontx1review.asp">material</a> from DPreview.com) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11570/</a></p>
