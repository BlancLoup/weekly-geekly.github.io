The allocation of funding takes place in the framework of the <a href="http://asi.ru/nti/">National Technology Initiative</a> (NTI) - the state program of measures to support the development of promising industries in Russia. <br><br>  For the development of the initiative, nine key markets (‚Äúroad maps‚Äù) were selected, for each of which the state will allocate tens of billions of rubles.

According to the order, the Russian government together with the Agency for Strategic Initiatives, the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), leading universities and business associations of entrepreneurs prepared the first report on the development and implementation of scientific and technological information by July 1, 2015, and then compiles such reports every six months. <br><br>  According <a href="http://www.poisknews.ru/theme/science-politic/13501/">to the</a> organizers, the goal of the NTI is to ‚Äúensure global technological parity of Russia and the countries-technological leaders.‚Äù To achieve it, it was proposed to solve the problems of import substitution within 5-7 years, and in the longer term (20-30 years) to move to a new technological structure domestic economy and re-industrialization. <br><br>  Russia's global technological leadership will be achieved with the help of strong state support for key technological areas.  According to the <a href="http://government.ru/media/files/T9Crayp8PsBQU6hdVAl0SsDlu2XvCvYG.pdf">first report of ASI</a> (speaker: Peskov D.), financing of nine markets is included in the NTI Matrix for ‚Äúsystem work‚Äù (they are listed below). <br><br><h3>  Forsyth Fleet </h3><br>  As explained on the official website of the NTI, <a href="http://asi.ru/news/36010/">Forsyth Fleet</a> became a key point for assembling roadmaps in the NTI Matrix on May 16, 2015. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bf/b5a/1da/8bfb5a1da470444581b5bb150db62b1c.jpg"><br>  <i>Forsyth Fleet 2015</i> <br><br>  Forsyth Fleet is the ‚Äúmost ambitious brainstorming of the year,‚Äù in which over 600 participants took part in five days ‚Äî technological entrepreneurs, venture investors, scientists, representatives of the educational environment and development institutions, business and public associations, leaders of enterprises in the real sector of the economy, federal executive bodies. <br><br>  Participants in the brainstorming were placed on three ships: <br><br>  <b>The motor ship "Leo Tolstoy</b> . <b>"</b>  Intellectual Transport Markets Group. <br>  <b>The motor ship "Zosima Shashkov"</b> .  Group of markets related to national security and competitiveness. <br>  <b>Motor ship "Alexander Radishchev"</b> .  A group of markets containing resources and groundwork for breakthrough solutions that could potentially lead Russia to the leading positions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/921/2f7/98b/9212f798b69c4fbbab68fdf7a214a143.jpg"><br>  <i>One of the three motor ships of the Forsyth Fleet 2015 brainstorming</i> <br><br>  The brainstorming participants designed promising markets and developed roadmaps for the appearance of Russian technology companies in these markets ‚Äî national champions by 2035. <br><br>  After a brainstorming session on the ships, the NTI Matrix took on its current form. <br><br><h3>  STI matrix </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/760/bb4/1ad/760bb41ad28b42fd9c29e73ec03fd36e.png"><br><br>  The heads of some of the working groups and the main technological directions for the development of markets <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0">are listed in the table</a> drawn up by the reports of ASI from 2015. <br><br>  The prefix "Net" in the name of each direction <a href="http://b-mag.ru/2015/strategiya/ryinki-iz-niotkuda/">means the network principle of market organization</a> - "the replacement of intermediaries with an automated intellectual system, through which all its participants interact, including the end user." <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  No </th><th>  Roadmap name </th><th>  Direction </th><th>  Team Leader </th><th>  Market objectives (technology) </th><th>  Expected market volume by 2035 </th></tr><tr><td>  one </td><td>  AeroNet </td><td>  air Transport </td><td>  Sergey Zhukov, cosmonaut, general director of the Technology Transfer Center </td><td>  unmanned aerial vehicles, negotiations are underway with the Post of Russia on the possibility of unmanned parcel delivery </td><td>  $ 300-350 billion </td></tr><tr><td>  2 </td><td>  AutoNet </td><td>  automobile transport </td><td>  Sergey Kogogin, General Director of KamAZ </td><td>  unmanned vehicles, intelligent transportation systems </td><td>  $ 2500-3000 billion </td></tr><tr><td>  3 </td><td>  Energynet </td><td>  energy </td><td>  Boris Ryabov, managing partner of Bright Capital Venture Fund </td><td>  renewable energy smart grid </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  four </td><td>  FinNet </td><td>  finance </td><td></td><td>  distributed financial systems, cryptocurrency </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  five </td><td>  FoodNet </td><td>  food </td><td>  Sergey Vykhodtsev, President of Velle, founder of the Bystrov brand </td><td>  elimination of intermediaries between the producer and the consumer, personal production and delivery systems </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  6 </td><td>  HealthNet </td><td>  the medicine </td><td>  Alexey Repik, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the R-Pharm Group of Companies </td><td>  life extension, personalized medicine, biomarker use and mathematical modeling of diseases </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  7 </td><td>  MariNet </td><td>  sea ‚Äã‚Äãtransport </td><td>  Sergey Generalov, President of the Industrial Investors group of companies </td><td>  unmanned ships ("OSK-Transas"), intelligent transport systems </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  eight </td><td>  NeuroNet </td><td>  neurocommunications </td><td>  Andrey Ivaschenko, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Center of High Technologies "ChemRar" </td><td>  brain mapping, creating a new generation of WWW based on neurocomputer interfaces, managing the power of thought </td><td>  $ 250-300 billion </td></tr><tr><td>  9 </td><td>  SafeNet </td><td>  security </td><td></td><td>  new personal security systems (eg biometric authentication systems) </td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The Kommersant newspaper got acquainted with the SafeNet roadmap project until 2035.  The Roadmap defines the financing of the market for information and cyber-physical security systems. <br><br>  According to the document, cyber-physical systems are ‚Äúsmart systems that include networks of interconnected computing and physical components, such as robots, intelligent buildings, medical implants, self-driving cars, unmanned aircraft‚Äù. <br><br>  At today's meeting, SafeNet will be reviewed, as well as several other work cards for other markets (AutoNet, HealthNet, etc.). <br><br>  By the way, Dmitry Lopatin is involved in the implementation of one of the ‚Äúroad maps‚Äù - the same winner of the Zvorykin Prize, the inventor of solar cells on perovskites, who was nearly imprisoned for 11 years for purchasing solvent in China (see the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/253626/">article on Geektimes</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/196/cb5/729/196cb57295c4452e9fa0bd888bde4947.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo: Vladimir Anosov / RG</i> <br><br>  According to the plans of the National Technology Initiative, during 2018-2025 ‚Äúin a number of subjects of the Russian Federation there will be a 5G standard mobile communication infrastructure, a unified network of centers for protection against cyber threats for civilian use will be launched, the first projects of introducing the domestic intellectual system of urban management will be implemented, domestic OSs will be created for cyber-physical systems and autonomous transport ". <br><br>  In addition, in the coming years, a domestic compiled language will be developed for safe and efficient parallel programming. <br><br>  In the more distant plans (2025-2035) - the introduction of a neural interface, quantum computing, teleportation, the use of nature-like phenomena for information transfer, the creation of "infrastructure of quantum communications to ensure absolutely safe communication" and the emergence of a new type of communication operator for unmanned systems. <br><br>  SafeNet's roadmap budget for 2016-2018 amounts to 10.8 billion rubles, of which more than 7 billion rubles.  must come from the federal budget. <br><br>  For the rest of the roadmaps, a separate stable funding is provided until 2035. <br><br>  Andrei Nikitin, Director General of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives to Promote New Projects, <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/Doc/2805114">believes</a> that if we start now with ‚Äúroad maps,‚Äù then in 20 years it is quite possible to arrive at a result comparable to the Soviet-era space program.  Now we have the same situation as the group of engineers in the basement of the house on the Garden Ring in Moscow, says Nikitin, recalling the beginning of the work of the group for studying jet propulsion (GIRD): <br><br><blockquote> Established in 1931, it huddled in the basement of the house N 19 in Sadovo-Spasskaya Street.  The head of the GIRD was Friedrich Zander, the technical council was headed by Sergey Korolev.  The age of employees did not exceed, as a rule, 25 years.  And here they, the young ones, tried to put the ideas of Tsiolkovsky into practice.  Two years later, the first rocket flew.  GIRD and Leningrad Gas Dynamic Laboratory were merged into Reactive Research Institute. </blockquote><br>  Igor Agamirzyan, the head of the Russian Venture Company, which is entrusted with the function of the NTI project office, <a href="http://b-mag.ru/2015/strategiya/ryinki-iz-niotkuda/">explained the</a> idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe National Technology Initiative even more romanticly: <br><br><blockquote>  The meaning of NTI is to work ahead of the curve.  Remember, in biology class at school, it was taught that when the ice age began, the animals were overgrown with fur and survived.  In reality, it was a little different.  Just before the beginning of the ice age, someone was covered with wool, and some did not.  Those who are not overgrown, died out, and we do not remember them.  Here is the same thing: big changes are coming, it's time, relatively speaking, to ‚Äúovergrow‚Äù.  NTI is an attempt to fit into that evolutionary process that is happening all over the world and does not by any means pass our country. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395493/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395493/</a></p>
