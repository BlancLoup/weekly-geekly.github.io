  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is ‚Äúdigital transformation‚Äù and ‚Äúdigital assets‚Äù?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I want to talk about what a ‚Äúfigure‚Äù is.  Digital transformation, digital assets, digital product ... These words are heard today from everywhere.  In Russia, the national programs are being launched, and even the ministry is being renamed, but reading articles and reports you will come across completely round words and vague definitions.  Recently, I was at work at a ‚Äúhigh-level‚Äù meeting, where representatives of a respected institute training personnel in the field of information technology to the question ‚ÄúWhat is the difference between informatization and digitalization‚Äù answered that ‚Äúthis is the same thing ‚Äî simply digitization is is a word ". <br><br>  I think it's time to figure it out. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If you try somewhere to find clear definitions, they are not.  Usually they are repelled by technology (they say, where a big date is introduced, artificial intelligence and the like - there is a digital transformation).  Sometimes, human participation is paramount (they say, if robots force out people, this is digitalization).

      I have another presentation.  I propose to find a criterion that will help distinguish the "digital" from the "ordinary".  Having found the criterion, we will come to a simple and understandable definition. <br><br>  In order not to become obsolete, this criterion should not appeal to technologies (they appear like mushrooms after rain), nor to the participation of people in the technological process (this story has already been ‚Äúworked out‚Äù by the technological revolution). <br><br>  Pay attention to the business model and product.  With this product, I call something (a product or a service) that carries value (for example, a cake, a car or a haircut at a hairdresser), and a business model is a set of processes aimed at producing value and delivering it to a consumer. <br><br>  Historically, the product was "ordinary" (if you want - say "analog", but for me, so "loaf of analog bread" - sounds pretentious).  There have been and will be a mass of ordinary goods and services in the world.  All of them are united by the fact that for the production of each copy of such a product it is necessary to expend resources (as the cat Matroskin said, in order to sell something unnecessary, you need to buy something unnecessary).  To make a loaf of bread you need flour and water; to make a car you need a lot of things to mow someone you need to spend time. <br><br>  Every time, for every copy. <br><br>  And there are such products, the production cost of each new copy of which is zero (or tends to zero).  For example, you recorded a song, took a photo, developed a program for an iPhone android, and everything ... You sell them again and again, and they, firstly, do not end with them, and secondly, each new copy costs you nothing. <br><br>  The idea is not new.  In world history there are plenty of examples of products, the production of each copy of which was not worth anything.  For example, the sale of plots on the moon or closer to us units in some financial pyramid (for example, MMM tickets).  Usually it was something illegal (at the same time I'm not even talking about the criminal code, but about the very law of conservation of "energy-matter-life-universe-and-all-such", which was announced by the cat Matroskin). <br><br>  However, with the development of technology (the advent of computers, computer networks, and everything derived from them - cloud technologies, artificial intelligence, big dates, etc.), there is a unique opportunity to copy products endlessly and for free.  Someone took it literally and simply copied money on a copier (but this is again illegal), but the sale of digitized musical compositions on I-tunes, digital photos in photo banks, applications to Google Play or Appstor is all legitimate and quite profitable. , because, as you remember, each new copy brings money and costs nothing.  This is a digital product. <br><br>  A digital asset is something that allows you to produce a product (to replicate a product or provide a service), the cost of production of each subsequent copy of which tends to zero (for example, your online store through which you sell something or a database of atomic reactor sensors allows you to build forecasts and conduct experiments). <br><br>  Digital transformation is the transition from the production of material products to the production of digital products, as well as (and / or) the transition to business models that use digital assets. <br><br>  As you can see, everything is simple.  Such is the transformation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451440/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451440/</a></p>
