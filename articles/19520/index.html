  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New web technologies at DEMO 08</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The <a href="http://www.demo.com/">DEMO</a> exhibition has already become the main place where promising start-ups show their developments.  If earlier the public got acquainted with new gadgets (the Palm Pilot and TiVo announcements took place at DEMO), now DEMO has become an exhibition mainly of Internet startups. <br><br>  On the last show, January 28-30, 2008, 77 companies were represented.  We will tell about the ten most interesting, about which we hear for the first time.  Some of these web applications can make a real revolution in their fields, they can now be used effectively.  Others are well worthy of cloning in RuNet (it‚Äôs no secret that the very smart entrepreneurs are carefully studying such reviews for this very reason). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Planner <a href="http://liquidplanner.com/">Liquid Planner</a> claims to make a "revolution in project management", although in reality it is a kind of analogue of Basecamp with the additional functionality of social networks. <br><br>  One of the numerous representatives of the new generation of UGC sites is a guide to all corners of the world <a href="http://www.citiport.net/">Citiport.net</a> , where anyone can share their impressions and photos of a particular city.

      Some may be interested in the new mobile browser <a href="http://www.skyfire.com/">SkyFire</a> , a potential competitor to Opera Mini, which, however, still works exclusively under Windows Mobile. <br><br>  The exhibition was presented a program for video conferencing <a href="http://avistar.com/products/default.aspx%3Fid%3D68">Avistar Conference</a> , capable of serving several people at the same time.  The developers tried to copy the functionality of a similar iChatAV program for Mac. <br><br>  <a href="http://ribbit.com/">Ribbit</a> presented a very interesting <a href="http://www.ribbit.com/everyone/tour/enhanced_visual_voicemail.php">Amphibian</a> web applet for voice communication and related services.  The program does not just allow you to call from the Internet to a mobile phone (you can hang up the phone list right in your Facebook profile, for example), but also manages your voice mail online, shows its presence status with the caller's number (what he is doing now).  The most lethal feature is the translation of incoming voice messages into a text view.  Such a program would look very organically as an extension of the functionality of an iPhone or another communicator. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.planwithvoyant.com/">Voyant</a> web application <a href="http://www.planwithvoyant.com/">is</a> designed for personal financial planning.  We have such planners are not very common, probably because our income is difficult to predict, respectively, and planning costs does not make much sense.  But in the west, where people for decades receive the same salary every week up to a cent, such software is very relevant there. <br><br>  The original <a href="http://www.review2buy.com/beta/">Review2Buy</a> program <a href="http://www.review2buy.com/beta/">was</a> created for a very specific audience of wine gourmets.  Specialized reference service resets to the mobile phone the full information about the brand of wine, as well as its prices.  By the way, the company promotes similar services not only for wine, but also for books, films, music and portable electronics.  If they adjust the automatic recognition of the goods by the bar code of the cell phone camera (there are already such technologies), the service will become even more convenient. <br><br>  For those users who find the Google Docs interface too complex, a superprimitive online DBMS called <a href="http://blist.com/">Blist is intended</a> .  It is suitable for storing all sorts of lists, photos and other types of data. <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.cellspin.net/">CellSpin</a> mobile phone <a href="http://www.cellspin.net/">application</a> makes it easy to download content to online UGC services, including Flickr, Facebook, YouTube and even eBay. <br><br>  The <a href="http://flypaper.net/">FlyPaper</a> utility <a href="http://flypaper.net/">does</a> not yet have an online version, so it needs to be downloaded and installed under Win.  According to the developers, the program simplifies the process of creating interactive Flash-presentations to impossibility.  Thanks to the many free templates it turns out very beautiful.  By the way, the exhibition showed another program of the same plan <a href="http://sproutbuilder.com/">Sprout Builder</a> .  But this is a much more powerful tool for creating widgets, and you can even work with it online as with an applet. <br><br>  Another interesting site with a great idea and performance is <a href="http://ivideosongs.com/">iVideoSongs</a> .  This is an online primer for musicians.  The videos show how musical celebrities (Eric Clapton, Santana, etc.) perform their songs.  In most videos, finger movements are shown on a conventional acoustic guitar, but there is a video on an electric guitar, banjo, piano, and percussion.  There are also standard tutorials (video) on playing these instruments on the site. <br><br>  via <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/01/29/launchpad-and-flameout/">Center for Citizen Media</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19520/</a></p>
