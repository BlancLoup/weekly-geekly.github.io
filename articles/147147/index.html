  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bright future with Rostelecom! Is it possible?! Yes, if you try</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The main purpose of this post: to draw the attention of the company Rostelecom to the current situation, because  I did not find another way to reach the manual.  Unfortunately, my experience shows that as long as the bosses are not in the know - no one will do anything!  I hope Habr is read by Rostelecom employees and they will assist me in solving my story. <br><br>  My story began in May of this year: Rostelecom sent me and my Grandmother (two different apartments in the same apartment building) letters that he translates everyone into digital fiber-optical technologies - telephone, Internet and television. <br><br>  Cool, I thought!  Finally, high technologies came to our small town, and we will live with them in a new way.  Additionally bribed the fame of the company carrying out all the work and hope for a bright future.  Without thinking twice (even in spite of the obligatory number change), we decided to join in, so to speak, modern technologies and applied for readiness to begin the process right now.

      This is where our ‚Äúbright future‚Äù began ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After the application was reviewed, we were informed that right now they can not connect us and we need to wait a few days.  As a result, the waiting was about a week, and this is, in principle, normal, because  we didn‚Äôt take much time, expecting high quality of work. <br><br>  On the appointed day, Rostelecom employees came to my Grandmother and installed all the necessary equipment for her, hooked up the phone to the line.  They gave her my new phone number (it was important that she was aware of how to call me).  After that, one of the employees came to me, estimated the work plan and said that now he doesn‚Äôt have any pieces, and he will not be able to immediately install my phone, so we agreed that he would come the next day.  My grandmother and I live in the same staircase, so it‚Äôs extremely strange that we‚Äôve hooked it up, but I don‚Äôt (it‚Äôs definitely a joint that needed to be quickly resolved). <br><br>  The ‚Äúnext day‚Äù lasted for a whole week - I had to additionally call the service center of Rostelecom ... After the call, they remembered me and quickly connected the phone using a new fiber-optic technology, changing the promised number. <br><br>  Nothing foreshadowed trouble - we even managed to make a phone call.  Several days.  However, there was a new problem ... My grandmother's phone was silent.  Completely!  After that, almost immediately we called Rostelecom and filed a repair request. <br><br>  But the music did not last long - after a week, my telephone also fell silent ... Again they called the service center and issued a new application for the second one. <br><br>  <b><s>If necessary, I am ready to provide application numbers.</s></b> <br><br>  A month has passed since the filing of both applications, but nothing has changed ... Once Rostelecom‚Äôs equipment came.  Touched the cable, rustled in the stairwell - that's all.  They left quietly, without saying a word - at least briefly outlined the situation, outlined the prospects ... well, type, do not expect anything quickly.  Although transparently hinted at the unsuccessful contractor who pulled this very optical fiber. <br><br>  Patience was running out - a month without a phone is, sorry, GESTURE !!! <br><br>  There was no desire to call again at the Rostelecom TP, so I wrote them a mail. <br>  Got a response - the application is in the works.  Not a word about the terms, I decided to write another letter clarifying the terms.  To the letter instead of the answer I received an automatically generated message. <br><br>  The other day came SMS'ka that my Grandmother's application is closed!  Batyushki, the phone has earned!  I thought ... But nothing worked and does not work to this day (07/04/2012) !!! <br><br>  Having estimated everything, I realized that exactly one month had passed from the moment of filing the first application, and the company apparently decided to close the applications in order to ‚Äúshow‚Äù how cool and efficient the service men are ... <br><br>  Yesterday I called TP Rostelecom, described the situation in color.  Especially about the closing of the application, which in fact is not solved. <br><br><br>  And finally - <b>IZZHGU</b> !!! <br><br>  Dear Rostelecom Managers! <br><br>  Do you have parents?  Aha  Now imagine that they have disabled the only channel of communication with the world.  They cannot call an ambulance, fire brigade or the police - in general, any necessary emergency help ... They cannot call either you or anyone else ... <br><br>  A month has passed - and as a result, nothing has changed, the only thing that happened was that their application for the restoration of a working connection was accepted and, ATTENTION, closed !!! <br><br>  This, sorry, GESTURE !!! <br><br>  Or not tin?  Your parents have excellent health, they have no pain, they feel for 20 years, both internally and physically? <br><br>  You are a monopolist, but it does not give you the right to "score" on the client !!! <br><br>  I am ashamed of Russia in your face!  REMEMBER !!!  I BEG!!! <br><br>  PS What happiness, that I did not succumb to persuasion on the Internet ... <br><br>  ______ <br>  <s>With lost respect, Arkady, who hopes to restore at least some respect for Rostelecom ...</s> <br>  Sincerely, Arkady <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <s>I wanted to attach the post to the ‚ÄúI resent‚Äù hub, but karma does not allow ...</s> I don‚Äôt want to. <br>  <b>UPD # 2:</b> thanks to everyone who appreciates this post - this is very important to me! <br><br>  <b>UPD # 3:</b> I decided, as far as possible, to describe the next steps to be taken to solve the problem with a landline phone. <br>  <b>07/01/2012 - 07/03/2012</b> : after receiving the SMS, that the application is closed, he called them and said that the phone didn‚Äôt work either. <br>  <b>04.07.2012</b> : The post on Habr√© is published.  Thanks to everyone in the comments - very supportive! <br>  <b>07/06/2012</b> : the phone still does not work for me and for my Grandmother - I decided to call Rostelecom at 8-800-300-18-03.  I called and was shocked - one of the applications was closed, because ‚Äúthe same problem is being solved‚Äù, the second application is also closed with the wording ‚Äúwe did everything, but we could not get through to the telephone, such a phone was ...‚Äù strange.  There were no calls.  When I explained that the phones still do not work - the TP employee said that he would reopen the application.  The whole situation strongly hooked me - the call after receiving the SMS went in vain - no one renewed or decided on anything ... And if I hadn‚Äôt called today, I would have gone out of it for another month or more ... The tin itself turned out at the end of a stormy conversation <b>‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know deadlines for completing the application! ‚Äù</b> This, if exaggerated, means that they can drag on for at least two months - they did not promise anything ... Clean!  In a word ... I would like to note that under my pressure the TP employee Rostelecom was always restrained and polite, I hope he understands that my pressure is caused by the actions of Rostelecom, and I personally have no complaints about him.  After the call I went to read Habr and in the comments I found an employee of Rostelecom, who volunteered to help with the problem.  I'll try to write to him and wait a bit.  If it does not help, I will write a packet of letters, send it by mail, and I will do everything so that it stops !!!  And, yes, these are not threats, these are FORCED actions by the user of communication services! <br>  <b>07/06/2012</b> : I wrote about the problem to one of the employees of Rostelecom <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/matramatic/" class="user_link">matramatic</a> , additionally, on his advice, in the evening I duplicated the problem of VKontakte and 1 (I wrote private messages). <br>  <b>07/07/2012</b> : in the morning (08:06) I received a response from Rostelecom VKontakte that they work on my problem and, most importantly, that they will keep me updated on the progress of work!  This is awesome and I am very glad that I was heard!  Now just wait for further development, but something tells me that the development will be positive and everything will get better ... Let's wait and see! <br>  <b>07/07/2012</b> : I just visited Grandma (15:10) - her phone seems to be working.  I do not know whether the problem has been solved, because  perhaps this is a temporary "effect".  I hope, of course, that this is not the effect, but the constant normal operation of the phone.  I'll check it out again tomorrow.  My phone is not working yet (short, low beeps on the handset). <br>  <b>07/09/2012</b> : hurray, hurray - and I got a phone!  Analyzing the situation, I understand how important it is to speak, to find hooks, clinging to which your problem will be solved.  Post published July 4, 2012 - July 9, 2012 all problems solved!  As far as I understood the problem was in incorrectly connected cables (mixed up), as a result, the problem was solved in 10-15 minutes (approximately), but spent time a little more than a month of time.  A lot of water has flowed under it, a lot of nerves have been spent - but in the end ... everything is fine, life is running, everything is gradually getting better! <br><br>  Thank you for supporting me! <br>  I will keep everyone informed how things are going on my problem. <br><br>  <b>As a result</b> : I am very glad that the situation has returned to normal! <br>  Thank you all for your support!  As a result, the Habr-user <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/matramatic/" class="user_link">matramatic</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/147147/">comment</a> helped. <br>  I hope for further uninterrupted cooperation with Rostelecom.  I think we all learned certain lessons from the situation and in the future we will solve problems differently.  In my opinion is very important attitude to the client, then how well he is aware of the work on his problem.  Everyone has shoals, but not everyone knows how to solve them loyally.  If I was constantly kept in the know about the problem - there would not be this post, no one would have known that there is a lot of pressure.  It is important. <br><br>  Good luck, love and patience! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147147/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147147/</a></p>
