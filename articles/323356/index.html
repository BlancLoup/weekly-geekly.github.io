  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Trial of Wap-Click Subscriptions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Often, users of popular operators have questions about why a certain amount is deducted from them and where this money goes.  <i>‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt connected anything,‚Äù</i> they say. <br><br>  The content subscription system works very simply, for example: <br><br><ol><li>  The subscriber decided to watch a movie from the phone </li><li>  When entering the site, using a script, it is redirected to a landing page on which there is a ‚ÄúWatch‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button </li><li>  By clicking on this button, the subscriber agrees to the conditions and subscribes to the service. </li><li>  At the same time, he receives content, and the amount is deducted from his account. </li><li>  And the most important thing is that it is legal and agreed with the telecom operator. </li></ol><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Consider this on the part of the arbitrator</i> . <br>  First you need to choose an affiliate program.  When choosing, I was guided by several principles: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ol><li>  You can get there without experience (not all affiliates allow beginners) </li><li>  Extensive geo </li><li>  Good support (because I am new to this business, then I will have a lot of questions) </li></ol><br>  After that, you need to select the grid, where we will redeem the traffic and send it to the artnerk. <br>  I will not write their names so that there is no advertising, but I will say that they are very well known and can be understood from the interface screens if you are interested. <br><br>  So, let's start by creating a stream in the parquet, where we indicate its name, subid, trafficback and postback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a61/15e/7d3/a6115e7d3aa64549b3acff2d2c0d9790.jpg"><br><br>  After we go to the rotators, where we choose the landing pages, which will be shown to the users, based on the subject, the country and the operator.  For myself, I chose the theme of the adult, since  It is the most extensive in terms of traffic; Russia set the country, and chose an operator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7a/259/fc9/f7a259fc9c364e82957b7a2fbda2ca0a.jpg"><br><br>  For each landing there is a conversion.  As well as various amounts that are debited from the subscriber.  Price redemption or rebilla.  If you select several landing pages, then this affiliate program has the opportunity to put a smart rotator, which itself will substitute to the user the landing page, which at the moment can convey better. <br><br>  At the exit we get the url, with which we go to the advertising network.  There we replenish the balance and create a company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b64/694/e21/b64694e213f6414cbd4f20d7f6907284.jpg"><br><br>  There is a fairly extensive targeting, it can be seen on the screenshot below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2e/bd9/960/e2ebd99602be4e699330a9eb3a22a523.jpg"><br><br>  It is very important to specify the IP ranges, you can take them from the affiliate program. <br><br>  It is also possible, even necessary, to indicate either a black list (numbers of sites in the grid on which you do not want to be shown) or a white list (on the contrary, sites with the largest envelope by which you exit 100% plus).  Lists are recruited over time based on your statistics.  In order not to drain the entire budget at once, you can set limits either to money or by the number of clicks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f6/35a/d5f/0f635ad5f0644ea8881fc127fe47c91e.jpg"><br><br>  After passing moderation, the company will start and will unwind.  In this advertising network, you can pour both on the clicker and on your banners.  Such grids work on an auction basis.  Then the whole thing in monitoring statistics, to add sites to the sheets. <br><br>  Of course it‚Äôs better to set up a tracker right away, this will make it much easier to get a plus, as experienced arbitragers say. <br><br>  What will be my conclusion: the topic for me personally is very interesting, because  there is instant statistics and the ability to monitor everything immediately and make any changes.  If you invest a good amount, you can buy large amounts of traffic, and if the sheets are collected, then this is happiness.  For me, the topic is developing, although many shout that wap click is dead, and indeed there is no money on the Internet, stick to it. <br><br>  At this finish, thanks for reading and spending your time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323356/</a></p>
