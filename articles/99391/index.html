So, a large number of specialists in various fields of activity, from IT to the economy, say that Google's algorithms should be made public. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  One of the first people on the long list who wanted to know ‚ÄúGoogle's secret‚Äù was <b>The New York Times</b> , <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/opinion/15thu3.html%3F_r%3D5">which stated</a> that ‚Äúthe potential impact of Google‚Äôs search algorithm on the economy is extremely large, and a special commission should make sure that Google works by constantly improving the quality of the search service rather than helping your own business lines. ‚Äù

      Interestingly, such an authoritative publication found a no less authoritative opponent, <b>The Financial Times</b> , on whose pages <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0458b1a4-8f78-11df-8df0-00144feab49a.html">part of the speech by</a> Marissa Meyer, vice president for search products and user satisfaction, was repeated.  Literally, it was said that ‚Äúif search engines are forced to reveal their algorithms, attackers will immediately take advantage of this, who will immediately begin to use the information obtained for their own purposes.‚Äù <br><br>  In general, now the regulatory policy of the United States and Europe is a headache, because it is necessary to maneuver between the need to demonstrate openness and the need to securely store corporate secrets.  Already very significant forces are now involved in order to try to at least partially reveal the secret of the work of Google search engines.  At the same time, it is quite understandable that if Google really begins to talk about its secrets, about the mechanisms of the search engine, then really, only the lazy will not take advantage of all this to extract additional profits or to get any other benefits.  Chaos will begin, which is likely to end with the transition of Google users to other search services.  After that, according to experts, the same will begin again - the regulators from the policy will start to ‚Äúpressure‚Äù on the new search engine No. 1, he will be forced to surrender, and chaos will begin again.  And so on without end. <br><br>  It is interesting that so far the main regulatory burden is ‚Äúhanging‚Äù on Google, while other search engines, including Bing from Microsoft, Yahoo, Ask.com, are still not touched.  But if Google is forced to open its secrets, then why would these companies be allowed to keep their secrets?  Probably, in this case, all search services will be forced to show their own algorithms, and then the end of the search services era will come, which will hit the entire Internet sphere very hard.  Probably, all this can be compared with the explosion of the atomic bomb in the center of the economic capital of any country.  All this is followed by a collapse and the slow (or fast) dying of the Internet sphere. <br><br>  On the other hand, one may fear that in the end companies, which are allowed to keep everything secret, can actually use their own technologies in their own best interest.  It is so easy to slightly change the algorithm for changing the issue, and to receive as a result a little ‚Äútampered‚Äù news that can lead to a change in the work of financial markets, or there a little ‚Äútune in‚Äù a certain algorithm responsible for the uniformity of issuing information of a political nature.  And then there will be something like the Orwellian "1984".  Today we are "friends" with some, tomorrow these are the worst enemies with whom, as it turned out, we have always been hostile.  In general, something like. <br><br>  And how does the Habrasoobschestvo believe, should search services keep search algorithms secret? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99391/</a></p>
