Surely many of you either already have rights, or plan to face the problem of receiving them in the near future. <br><br> <a href="http://spokoino.ru/"><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/090618/V3rjXgpGFW.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In any case, our project can be very useful - after all, we collected about two hundred auto-instructors on one site advertisements and made a convenient search for them.  Now you can find yourself a decent teacher or leave a review on the page of your old auto-instructor, if you have already been trained to drive.

      Get right, in the end, not the most important thing - it is important to learn how to drive.  You can get excellent driving skills and then never get into an accident on the road, having been trained by a quiet auto-instructor.  The task of finding an auto-instructor and is designed to solve our site.  In this article we will try to uncover issues of technical implementation, monetization of the project and tell you what problems we faced and how we solved them. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Implementation </h1>  <em>Convenience is the main thing.</em> <br><br>  Particular attention should be paid to our instant filters that are applied to the search results in one click.  For selection by price criterion, we used a convenient slider. <br><br><img alt="Filters" src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/090618/xpREGylvNl.jpg"><br><br>  Registering instructors on the site was created in such a way as to make this usually tedious and time consuming process as simple as possible.  First, we broke it up into 4 stages and made it possible to complete each stage separately. <br><br>  In this case, validation also occurs in stages.  All data will be saved, even if you accidentally moved to another step or even closed the browser.  Secondly, the loading and cropping of photos is done by js, which, of course, is very convenient for users who are not familiar with graphic editors.  Thirdly, after registering, the auto-instructor, in addition to notification to his mailbox, also receives a login and password in SMS. <br><br><h1>  Used technologies </h1>  For the site engine, CodeIgniter was used, the client part - on jQuery.  In the first version of the site, the search for instructors worked exclusively on js, which made it possible to very quickly filter and sort the output without additional requests to the server, since the entire catalog was loaded immediately.  We also made a lite lite version for those who have javascript disabled for some reason =).  Then the instructors on the site became much larger, the DOM tree of the search results document grew significantly and the question arose with the speed of work in various browsers (especially in IE6).  We did not forget about client optimization and tried to implement most of the well-known tips and recommendations, the Blog ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/client_side_optimization/">Client Optimization</a> ‚Äù and the book ‚Äú <a href="http://speedupyourwebsite.ru/">Accelerate Your Site</a> ‚Äù helped a lot.  As a result, the most effective approach was to reduce the number of nodes in the DOM tree and asynchronously load the page content as it scrolls. <br><br><h1>  Monetization </h1>  The main way to monetize we chose to place ads with additional features, such as visual selection among others. <br><br>  A distinctive feature of the implementation was the writing of a billing system that allowed for daily debit of auto-instructors, thus giving them the opportunity to pay for the placement of their questionnaire for an arbitrary period, rather than for a whole month, like competitors.  With its help, the instructor always knows how many days his profile is still hanging, how many and for what period of time funds were withdrawn from his account.  And we got the convenience of managing questionnaires, comments to instructors, write offs and credits to their personal accounts.  Due to the fact that we have significantly more auto-instructors than on other sites, we were able to provide the most flexible price conditions for our clients.  And you can pay for accommodation in any Kiwi machine (OSMP), we will appear there in the middle of July.  Our billing was also integrated with a telemarketing system for call-up and questioning of auto-instructors. <br><br><img alt="Administration Section - View Instructor Profile" src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/090618/TF0X0k72R5.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Plans </h1><br>  Naturally, we still have a lot to do: <ul><li>  launch in other cities of Russia; </li><li>  Moscow driving schools on Google Maps; </li><li>  further overcoming the barrier of misunderstanding with a multitude of auto-instructors, who consider that 10 sites with 20 instructors are better than one convenient. </li></ul><br>  Worked on the project (in alphabetical order): <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/bofh/" class="user_link">bofh</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/piumosso/" class="user_link">piumosso</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/prophet/" class="user_link">Prophet</a> , @vitman, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vorob/" class="user_link">vorob</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/xumepa/" class="user_link">Xumepa</a> . <br>  Thank you for creating the logo <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/karakteristika/" class="user_link">Karakteristika</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62377/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62377/</a></p>
