      Planning and compiling lists of what needs to be done (see, hear, try, visit, buy), as well as lists like ‚Äú10 best *** for 2008‚Äù, has always been a popular activity, both in the network and in offline (magazines).  But I have not met a single service combining such collections in runet. <br>  A sort of cocktail from <a href="http://mywishlist.ru/">mywishlist.ru</a> , <a href="http://kuda.yandex.ru/">kuda.yandex.ru</a> , <a href="http://lookatme.ru/">lookatme.ru</a> and all kinds of " <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">remmba ze milk</a> ". <br>  Of the western projects, the most similar, and extremely popular (there) <a href="http://www.43things.com/">www.43things.com</a> <br><br>  Users can create and copy lists and individual events from each other, subscribe to new entries by other participants, comment on individual entries and lists. <br>  Completed items are marked specials.  marker. <br>  Copied entries will be marked accordingly (the author will be able to see the list of participants who copied his entry). <br>  In fact, copying someone else's record at the same time is a vote for it. <br>  Based on this vote, uniform Hit-Sheets of the most popular events will be formed (in time), i.e.  You can go and find out what they recommend to do (where to go, what to read, what to see ...) next weekend (month, season, year ...). <br><br>  The project will integrate a system of widgets (users) - interactive images (banners), displaying the selected Hit Sheets and changes in them in real time. <br>  Such a widget can be placed by the user in his diary, on the website, forum or any other page (the mechanism is implemented by us in the <a href="http://www.hate-list.ru/">www.hate-list.ru</a> project). <br>  Such widgets are an additional means of attracting new visitors. <br>  Interviews and the publication of hit lists of celebrities (for example, TV stars or popular bloggers), etc. are also expected. <br><br>  One of the ways of the subsequent monetization of the project is the introduction of ‚Äúadvertising positions‚Äù (goods, events, etc.) into rating Hit-Sheets. <br><br>  Here are typical examples of what I'm talking about: <br>  <a href="http://podrostok-otd.ucoz.ru/blog/2007-01-22-12">http://podrostok-otd.ucoz.ru/blog/2007-01-22-12</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.webblog.ru/julia2512/4916/">http://www.webblog.ru/julia2512/4916/</a> <br>  <a href="http://bb.ct.kz/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D88828%26st%3D0">http://bb.ct.kz/index.php?showtopic=88828&amp;st=0</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.kp.ru/daily/23268/28518/">http://www.kp.ru/daily/23268/28518/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.newsru.com/cinema/23feb2007/dosug.html">http://www.newsru.com/cinema/23feb2007/dosug.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/46631/">http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/46631/</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/81ab6617-3483-df02-d193-c8bafa10b00a">Here</a> you can read the discussion on this topic. <br><br><h4>  2. Service on-line seminars and trainings. </h4><br>  For some time now, LJ has constantly stumbled upon an invitation to attend an online training / seminar. <br>  People want to share their knowledge and experience (this is genetically incorporated), and if it is also paid for (even symbolically), many are ready to devote themselves to it. <br>  Topics offer a variety of, starting with the basics of html and ending with the provision of first mediation care. <br>  Surely many of those present can spend hours talking about programming, usability, etc., I am also an itnik, <br>  but suppose I would like to learn how to cut gems, at least I can get basic knowledge in theory without leaving the computer. <br><br>  Show me a convenient platform on the network where anyone (specialist in their field) can quickly organize an online lesson (with chat conference, thematic materials, audio or video broadcast)?  On the other hand, can I ‚Äúrequest‚Äù somewhere for such training? <br>  We attach to this a system of reviews, ratings and polls, a payment system (classes can be free, can be paid in the form of voluntary encouragement (if you like) or have a fixed payment).  We take a percentage of all payments, for our part we are engaged in the complex promotion of the project, attracting listeners and lecturers.  Subscriptions to new classes, thematic conferences, etc.  - The functionality can be very wide. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/videos/1015.html">Here is a good example</a> , but it is very narrowly focused on it. <br>  Here is an example of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/24935/">what I mean</a> only for offline. <br><br>  Interesting? <br><br><h4>  3. Private hire (rare) things </h4><br>  <i>No one has a metal detector by chance (I want a treasure to go look for)?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And my snowboard is idle all season - to lend?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I will hire diving (alpnist) equipment!</i> <br>  - Bicycle, snowboard, audio / video equipment, laptops and much more. <br><br>  - Of course, now you can find anything you want to find in certain specialized rentals, but such organizations, as a rule, live on it and often their prices are comparable to the cost of used equipment. <br>  And buy, say, diving watch-computer for 20K rubles.  for a weekly tour, not everyone can afford it. <br><br>  For many of us, things that are not needed at this moment are lying around, but someone needs them. <br>  Why not rent them to a good person? <br>  Of course, I understand that the main problem is the safety (do not steal / do not break) rolling things. <br>  But I think it can be solved both by standard means (100% collateral), and by a rating / feedback system, ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and ‚Äúkarma‚Äù :) <br>  The user may set the rental price independently (laying down depreciation and / or additionally indicating fines). <br>  The whole billing system can organize. <br><br>  Continue? <br><br><h4>  4. Good news </h4><br>  There is such a theory that bad news generates negative fields around us and, more simply, spoils our life. <br>  We will not delve into the theory, at least how we know all such news spoil the mood. <br>  Personally, I generally prefer not to watch TV, but looking at <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/">news.yandex.ru</a> I somehow have to read about all the killings, fires and rape. <br>  Specially analyzed, negative news accounts for more than 70% of the total number of events. <br><br>  Actually the idea is to create a news aggregator in which there will be ONLY GOOD (positive) news. <br><br>  Of course, it would be quicker and easiest to note this advice to already working aggregators (the same Yandex) and simply tag each news with a positive / negative tag (or connect a vote). <br><br>  I think I'm not alone in the desire to ‚Äúbe in the subject line‚Äù, but at the same time, to protect myself from the negative that our newsmakers love so much. <br><br><h4>  Well, for a snack </h4><br>  Maybe someone has ideas (and implementation) on the targeted use of the following domains: <br>  <a href="http://geotag.ru/">GeoTag.ru</a> , <a href="http://macnazi.ru/">MacNazi.ru</a> (+ mac-nazi.ru) and <a href="http://shocklog.ru/">shocklog.ru</a> (here you can merge all the negative <a href="http://geotag.ru/">things</a> that did not go into the ‚Äúgood news‚Äù project :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53932/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53932/</a></p>
