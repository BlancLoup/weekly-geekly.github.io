  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How candidate's recommendations are verified</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you, as a candidate, competently composed your resume and wrote an effective cover letter, conducted work on their distribution, achieved interviews and successfully completed it, then it is likely that the next step on the difficult way to get a job will be checking your recommendations. <br><br>  It is logical and reasonable that a company that views you as a potential employee first of all wants to get <a name="habracut"></a>  adequate person and team member, not just a competent specialist.  Of course, compliance with the requirements of the vacancy, working conditions, company values, etc.  etc.  is determined by a number of criteria and can vary widely enough, but certain moments are certainly basic, and today we will consider them with an example. <br><br>  During my last employment, I used the services of a recruitment agency, which after several interviews with me, one of my former managers called me and sent another letter with the following content (translated from English): 
      <br>

      <i>Dear NN!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I need to check the recommendations of the name and I would be very grateful if you could answer a few questions about him and his work.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><ul><li>  What were his main responsibilities: tasks, project size, technical environment, etc.? </li><li>  Describe his contribution to the team / project work: main achievements and results. </li><li>  How would you describe his attitude to work: punctuality, organization, motivation? </li><li>  How would you describe his communication skills, oral and written? </li><li>  How does he react to criticism? </li><li>  How would you describe his character? </li><li>  How does he get along with other team members, management, customers, users? </li><li>  What would you advise to pay attention to his future supervisor to achieve the best results from working with him? </li><li>  Would you recommend hiring him?  Yes or no and why? </li><li>  How would you rate his performance in a team / project: excellent, good, average, bad and why? </li><li>  General comments are all you would like to add about his character or professionalism. </li></ul><br><br>  <i>Can we provide your recommendations to the candidate, as well as other potential employers?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thank.</i> <br><br>  As you can see, the questions are quite serious and, in general, requiring some work and time for detailed answers.  It is obvious that the people whose recommendation interests potential employers in the first place are your former immediate supervisors - the higher the hierarchy, the better.  Often, the provision of recommendations is governed by company policy and can be carried out only by the personnel department or top managers. <br><br>  Of course, they do not have much time for such communication, so in most cases the case is most likely limited to a short phone call.  However, this part of the job search is very important: it would be stupid, after going through all the stages, not to get a job because of the unflattering feedback from the former manager.  Therefore, it makes sense to attend to the preparation of their recommendations in advance. <br><br>  It is clear that situations in life are different, and it is not always convenient or it is possible to get good feedback from the former boss.  In this case, the recommendations of your other colleagues or partners may be an alternative.  For example, I even used the recommendations obtained on LinkedIn.com.  If you are not sure about the quality of your recommendation, it is better not to provide it at all for verification. <br><br>  In general, if you get to the stage of checking recommendations, it means that you are close to getting a job as never before. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86765/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86765/</a></p>
