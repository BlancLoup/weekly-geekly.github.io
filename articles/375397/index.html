But for some reason we lose sight of a very important and integral part of our future life - the game.  Old games will change, new varieties will appear, which will not even exist in theory.  For example, who could have predicted the appearance of online shooters in 1950?  And now tens of millions of people around the world are addicted to it. <br><br>  But still, no, no, yes, some curious fictional game will flash in the next sci-fi movie or book.  And it is possible that someday we will really play it.  And in the future demotivators, they will write about the character: ‚ÄúI played Quidditch even before it became mainstream‚Äù.

      In this article we decided not to mention the already scathing games based on virtual reality.  All sorts of races on futuristic vehicles are also hardly interesting to anyone.  Another thing is board games;  this post is dedicated to them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Tall card </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbc/ea8/0e7/dbcea80e78274177a33168009b5abc72.png"><br><br>  Probably one of the fans of the series Firefly (Firefly) will remember this game.  This strange space-fruit poker was played in the fourth episode, and Simon was the loser.  The rules of the game in the film have not been disclosed.  But fans of the series invented them themselves, which led to the release of the Tall Card <a href="http://www.entertainmentearth.com/prodinfo.asp%3Fnumber%3DTYV23006">for sale</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/620/b04/aed/620b04aed49349089289f1b49d04b240.png"><br><br><h1>  Cheops </h1><br>  In one of the epic fantastic books "Dune" by Frank Herbert, pyramidal chess called "Cheops" is mentioned.  Here, the playing field includes 9 levels that make up, as you might guess, the pyramid.  The game has a double goal: you must put your queen in the top of the pyramid and give the king to the enemy check. <br><br><h1>  Tadek </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf0/2d3/a38/cf02d3a38c494fba91be39faf6985ba9.png"><br><br>  At the beginning of the two thousandth, the adventure fantasy series Farscape ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25CD%25E0_%25EA%25F0%25E0%25FE_%25C2%25F1%25E5%25EB%25E5%25ED%25ED%25EE%25E9">On the Edge of the Universe</a> ) was shot, which lasted 4 seasons.  In episode 12 of the first season (starting at 10:04), the board game Tadek was shown, somewhat similar to chess.  Game pieces were made up of crystals, which are a form of currency in the series.  The playing field is square, it is divided into sectors.  During the moves, the color of the cells changes.  Also in certain situations, plasma balls are included. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYxWw03etXk&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhCI8N1NaSyumqlAdpysyvD3npt1w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  Snakes and Chanterelles </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b35/721/4b2/b357214b2cb84d3da41864feba219a07.jpg"><br><br>  This game is found in the book The Wheel of Time fantasy cycle "The Wheel of Time" by the writer Robert Jordan.  Fragments in which the Snakes and Chanterelles game is described in one way or another do not allow to restore the game process with accuracy.  Although in what book or movie are the rules of the fictional game completely laid out?  Here is what is said about it in the text: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Leaning on his elbow, Mat watched the game of snakes and chanterelles laid out on the tent floor.  Sometimes a drop of sweat was dripping from his chin - it‚Äôs good that it‚Äôs not on the game board.  True, in reality it was not a blackboard, but a piece of red matter lined with black ink.  The arrows indicated which lines could be used only in one direction, and from which in both.  Ten round chips of light wood with black triangles painted meant chanterelles, and ten of the same, but with wavy lines, snakes.  Two lamps burning on either side of the board gave enough light. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll definitely win this time, Mat.‚Äù  - Olvera's voice sounded excited.  - Be sure to win, you'll see. <br>  ‚ÄúVery possibly,‚Äù Mat said.  Two of their chips ‚Äî each with a black speck ‚Äî were already close to the center circle, but now they had to roll the bones for snakes and chanterelles.  Usually, at best, they were able to put only on the outer edge.  - Shake the bones. <br><br>  Mat himself did not even touch the circle with the bones, having entrusted this business to Olver, for he did not intend to waste his luck on the children's game.  Grinning, Olver shook the leather mug and threw the wooden bones made by his father.  Having counted the glasses, the guy groaned.  Three bones fell on the face, marked with a triangle, and three more - wavy lines.  So, they should move the snakes and chanterelles to their own chips by the shortest way, and if the course of chanterelles or snakes ended in your field ... <br><br>  The snake beat Olver's chip, the chanterelle Mat's chip.  And, as far as Mat could see, in the next move two more snakes overtook his chip. <br><br>  He knew that as long as you follow the rules, it is impossible to win this children's game.  When Olver matures, he too will understand this and, like all children, will simply abandon meaningless fun.  The game is a game, but Mat still felt uneasy when the chanterelle, and especially the snake, was eating his chip.  This suggested not very pleasant memories, even if one had nothing to do with the other. </div></div><br><br>  Attempts to understand the rules of the game is devoted to the <a href="http://www.wheeloftime.ru/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1031">branch</a> on the Russian-speaking fan forum. <br><br><h1>  3D chess </h1><br>  Star Trek's endless series (Star Trek) is filled with all sorts of strange board games.  Perhaps the most famous of them are three-dimensional chess, to which the creators of the Big Bang Theory series also paid tribute. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42e/874/03a/42e87403ace3484486e29fc945222fee.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9c/8e8/845/e9c8e88457a24ba182fc22a51094bde3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db4/047/93b/db404793bdbf4a6387716211b8abddb1.jpg"><br><br>  This game is also embodied in the real world.  The rules for it were invented back in 1976, and in 2014 a <a href="http://www.dynaverse.net/forum/index.php/board,3337.0.html">new version of the rules</a> came out.  If you wish, you can purchase your own set of chess, but the pleasure is not <a href="http://www.ebay.com/bhp/star-trek-chess">cheap</a> . <br><br><h1>  Wicked grace </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27b/a32/dba/27ba32dba3f84762ae35f3e373bd0d78.jpg"><br><br>  A <a href="http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Wicked_Grace">kind of poker</a> from the world of the game Dragon Age.  They play it together, each is dealt 5 cards.  Players play them, discarding and taking new ones, trying to collect one of the combinations.  The game is played until the Death Angel card rolls out.  The winner is the one who had the most powerful combination at that moment. <br><br><h1>  Towers </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bb/c73/b00/9bbc73b0059a4999811f119b9878e8b8.jpg"><br><br>  In the fantasy book dilogy of Olga Brileva ‚Äú <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2582%25D1%2583_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">On the Other Side of Dawn</a> ‚Äù, the game ‚ÄúTowers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãis mentioned - a sort of elven chess.  The game board has the form of a cross, each segment of which is divided into cells.  Three fans of the book about 5-6 years ago were inspired and developed <a href="http://forum.elfheim.ru/index.php%3FPHPSESSID%3D4693eb190cf271bf28ae74cf0ded718b%26topic%3D29.0">very detailed rules of the</a> game in the "Tower".  Moreover, they were allegedly approved by the author of the book. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> Once my friends and I read the book About Brilevoy ‚Äúon the Other Side of Dawn‚Äù.  The book described the game "Tower", it was played by the main characters of the story.  Finrod and others. We are interested in this game, because it is a good elf chess.  And based on what was described in the book, these rules were created. <br><br>  Developers: Lestar, Merlin and Den King <br>  (version corrected and modified). <br><br>  The rules were developed taking into account the developments of the author (Olga Brileva) plus - based on her description in the book, involving some analogies of chess.  The symbolism of the fortune-telling practice is fully described by Brileva.  Rules approved by the author (Olga Brileva). <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe board has a cruciform shape and is divided into 5 fields - four along the lines of light, the fifth - the middle one. <br><br>  Also they are called: formen - north, romen - east, hyarmen - south, numen - west.  The middle field is called the middle field. <br>  Each of the fields, in turn, into four small fields, named letters Tengvar.  Each of the small fields - on the four nameless. <br><br>  The names of small fields have a symbolic value.  With their help, in addition to the usual game, you can engage in divination and divination.  Divination can be associated with the game. <br><br>  Symbolism endowed with large fields. <br><br>  Formen - north, contains the signs "anga" - iron, "ando" - gate, "ngvalme" - suffering and "harma" - treasure.  These signs symbolize the tests that the soul and body undergo in the world: battles, obstacles, suffering and temptations. <br>  Numen - west, - the symbols of this field refer to what we would call spiritual values ‚Äã‚Äãand gifts.  "Vala" - strength, "Anna" - a gift, "Silme" - starlight and "Villa" - wind and sky. <br><br>  The middle field is dedicated to symbols denoting the inner world, the personality of a person or an elf.  "Ore" -heart, or "inner mind", "sss" - the name, "tule" - the spirit and "umbar" - fate. <br><br>  The field romen - east, denotes values ‚Äã‚Äãof intellectual and cognitive values.  ‚ÄúLambe‚Äù is a language, ‚ÄúParma‚Äù is a book, ‚ÄúNoldo‚Äù - I think, it means not so much ‚ÄúNoldo‚Äù as ‚Äúsage‚Äù, and ‚ÄúQueessa‚Äù - pen, or written speech. <br>  Finally, hyarmen - south is devoted to the symbolism of the earthly elements.  ‚ÄúTinko‚Äù is metal, ‚Äúalda‚Äù is wood, ‚Äúarda‚Äù is earth, and ‚Äúur‚Äù is fire or heat. <br><br>  Thus, the moves in the party in the "towers" denote including a spiritual search, some events in life. <br><br>  Each player has six pieces.  This (in order of placing them on the board, building a combination before the player makes his first move figure): ‚ÄúMindon‚Äù is a tower, ‚Äúshaft‚Äù is actually a shaft, and ‚ÄúIstar‚Äù is a magician, or, rather, ‚Äú a wise and strong adviser, endowed with supernatural abilities, a magician "," aran "- the king," Rohir "- a horseman," nervous "- a virgin warrior.  The goal of the game is to take the enemy's tower.  The tower is a fixed figure, but in its vicinity other figures gain an advantage.  Vala is a very strong figure.  The magician, king, rider and maiden differ in strength and range.  One piece can protect another piece as in chess.  If during the game the rider will pass all five large fields, he becomes king.  The figures are usually white and black, but not always - the main thing is that both sets of figures differ in color. <br><br>  The game consists of two parts.  The first is the arrangement of figures.  Players take turns placing their pieces on the board, starting with the tower.  It is believed that the one who plays black pieces and starts the placement second.  The second part is the game itself. ‚Äù <br><br>  The tower is a static figure.  Strengthens his pieces, standing within the same cell (or two, if the tower is on the extreme cell of the playing field) from the one on which the tower itself stands.  It is impossible, according to the rules, to put a piece in such a way as to take the tower from the first turn.  The zone of influence of the tower is a square that consists of 8 cells around the 9th, which the tower itself occupies (if the tower is placed near the central zone of its pyatina, this cell is central).  If the tower is placed in one of the cells located on the edge of the playing field, then its area of ‚Äã‚Äãinfluence is still a square consisting of nine cells, one of which is occupied by the tower.  Only in difference from the first case, the tower occupies not the central cell, but one of the cells of the extreme row. <br><br>  Vala is an analogue of a queen in chess.  He walks like a queen without limits.  They beat the figures like a queen vertically, horizontally and diagonally.  To threaten the tower - the shaft can threaten the tower from any distance - the shaft does not need to come close to the tower, to the next cell.  It is enough to put the shaft in such a way that it threatens the tower (that is, the tower is located near the ramparts on the line of attack).  If the shaft threatens the tower for two turns, and the enemy cannot close its access to the tower - the tower is considered to be taken. <br><br>  Istar - diagonally walks the entire length of the field, like a chess officer.  Vertically and horizontally walks on one cell.  Beat the figures only diagonally.  For the capture of the tower, the Istar must stand in the diagonally adjacent cage for two turns, after which the tower is considered to be taken. <br><br>  Vala and Istar - two figures that can take the tower alone. <br><br>  In the zone of influence of his tower, the Istar can walk horizontally and vertically into two cells (by strengthening it with his own tower).  That is, if initially the istar is placed in one of the cells of the field, reinforced by a tower, then from this initial position he can walk horizontally and vertically not one, but one or two cells.  But having left the field of influence with the end of the course, his tower can walk horizontally and vertically only one square. <br><br>  Aran - walks vertically, horizontally and diagonally at a distance of one or two cells.  In the zone of his tower - goes to two (three) cells.  The tower itself does not take - only in the company Rohira or nerven.  Beats a figure at the distance of his turn. <br><br>  Rohir - walks "angle", like a chess knight: the letter "g", consisting of 4 cells plus two more at an angle of 900 to the original direction.  He beats figures, like a chess knight (considering the length of his turn).  Rohir cannot take the tower by himself.  But bypassing all the five five Pyotin Rohir becomes Aran.  To threaten the tower in the company of the Aran, the Rokhir needs to stand in any cell adjacent to that which the tower occupies (that is, in its zone of influence). <br><br>  Nerven - walks the letter "g": 3 cells plus 1 cell at right angles to the original direction of movement (like a chess knight).  The tower alone does not take.  In order to threaten the tower, it is necessary to get into any cell adjacent to the one that the tower occupies (i.e., in its zone of influence).  Alone, the tower does not take, and if it is in the position of threatening the tower alone, the immediate threat to the tower is not. </div></div><br><br><h1>  Dragon Poker </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb0/968/230/cb09682307ca412f8d0b7f2ef7be4ce9.jpg"><br><br>  In the book cycle ‚ÄúMYTHICAL HISTORIES‚Äù of Robert Asprin, there is a mention of the game ‚Äúdragon poker‚Äù: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The most difficult card game for all dimensions.

Empire (Azadian Empire).  The game is three-dimensional, incredibly complex, has several playing fields and takes place on a huge platform where players can walk.  The figures on the field are lively and can be transformed depending on how they are played, or because of interaction with the player at a certain energy level.  For Azadi the game was incredibly important, so much so that they even selected the winner of the tournament as the Emperor, in which 12,000 players competed. <br><br><h1>  Kepesh-yakshi </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/948/f18/e6f/948f18e6ff7b445c96a067bc720ae3cb.png"><br><br>  This three-dimensional holographic game is well known to fans of Mass Effect 3. Perhaps, it can still be attributed to the desktop.  They play it together;  wins the one who destroys the "space base" of the opponent.
