  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Statistics of the Russian-speaking blogosphere (spring 2007)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the fall of 2006, Yandex for the first time released the newsletter The Blogosphere of the Russian Internet.  Now they have decided to publish the latest version of the statistical report ( <a href="http://download.yandex.ru/company/blogosphere2007apr.pdf">PDF</a> ).  It is interesting to track what changes have occurred in the blogosphere for six months.  For example, the total number of blogs during this time has almost doubled. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Russian blogosphere: scales</b> <br>  In the Russian-speaking blogosphere today there are 2 million blogs (half a year ago there were 1,150,000).  Over the past three months, at least one entry has appeared in more than 800 thousand blogs.  In total in the world, according to Technorati, there are more than 76 million blogs (half a year ago there were 54 million), that is, the Russian-language blogosphere is 3% of the world, but it is rapidly increasing its share. <br><br>  An average of 260 new Russian-language blogs appear hourly (in the fall of 2006, that number was 100). <br><br>  Total blog search has more than 20 million entries;  60 thousand more appear every day. Up to 5 new entries appear in Russian-language blogs every second time (half a year ago only 3 entries appeared during the same time).

      Russian-language blogs are maintained on 27 blog hostings (this number includes diary posting services containing more than two hundred blogs).  Russian diary services already contain 72% of blogs (six months ago this figure was 62%) and continue to increase their share.  The most popular service in Russia is still the American Livejournal.com, but according to the total number of blogs and the number of new posts per day, Russian LiveInternet.ru almost caught up with it. <br><br>  Livejournal remains the most visited blog service among Russian-speaking users.  Its daily audience reaches 600 thousand people, while LiveInternet has 170 thousand (according to its own statistics of blog hosting services). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/f77/6a0/099/f776a0099d071eb5aaa792f50e1e136d.jpg" width="450" height="279" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Together with blogs on publicly available blog hosting, the number of ‚Äústand-alone‚Äù blogs is growing (such online diaries are also called standalone blogs) - by March 2007 it has reached almost nine thousand.  Most offline bloggers (6,277 or 71%) use the WordPress engine.  Movable Type over the past six months has finally lost its influence, and now along with the rest of the engines, its share is less than 1%. <br><br>  <b>The average user of the Russian-language blogosphere</b> <br>  Over the past six months, the average Russian-speaking blogger has not changed - she is a 21-year-old girl who lives in Moscow and studies at a university.  The interests of the average girl blogger also remained the same: music, movies, psychology, books and sex. <br><br>  At the same time, the average age of the diary's author differs noticeably depending on the hosting: the average Livejournal user is 26 years old, and the bloggers with LiveInternet and Diary are 19 and 20 years old, respectively. <br><br>  The ratio of the ages of Russian-speaking bloggers has not changed much in six months: ‚ÄúGirl-blogger‚Äù is not only the main author of diaries, but also an active reader of posts made by other users.  According to a TNS Gallup survey of February 2007, the share of Muscovites aged 12 to 17 years in the blog search audience is almost twice as high as among all metropolitan Internet users;  for girls aged 18-24, the difference is one and a half times.  Over the course of a month, 76,000 Muscovites between the ages of 12 and 24 years old are looking for entries in the diaries - more than a quarter of the entire Moscow monthly audience of the Blog Search. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/810/b07/68c/810b0768cf6639a334fb458f201f99d5.jpg" width="450" height="288" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  It is interesting to note that the largest number of Russian-speaking bloggers, in addition to the obvious Moscow and St. Petersburg, live in the capitals of other countries.  There are more authors in Kiev, Minsk and Tallinn than in Samara or Novosibirsk. <br><br>  <b>Most Popular and Most Popular</b> <br>  For the blogosphere is very characteristic of the dissemination of information through the "opinion leaders".  Today, the thousand most popular Russian-language blogs are read by over 200 thousand other bloggers.  Thus, the topic, which will be written in the first thousand blogs, has a chance to be replicated in the blogs of their readers and, consequently, reach 80% of the users of blog hosting sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/3eb/4ce/dc6/3eb4cedc6e4824cbc0e64891fa9a3f15.jpg" width="450" height="447" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Authority is an integral indicator based on how often other bloggers refer to the blog in question, who specifically refers to, the number of comments on the blog, the number of blog readers known to Yandex, as well as other data on the blog and its position in the blogosphere . <br><br>  <b>Communities</b> <br>  In addition to personal blogs, there are so-called communities - collective blogs.  Communities can be used for different purposes - they can ask questions, discuss something with like-minded people, leave notes on a specific topic. <br><br>  Communities are popular.  More than 40% of Russian-speaking bloggers read communities or are members of them (this study did not take into account the technical communities to which some blog hostings automatically subscribe all their members). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/287/b30/70b/287b3070bb4169d463243f2925b76d9b.jpg" width="450" height="372" hspace="10" vspace="10"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288070/</a></p>
