The review includes: <br><ol><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172967/">rssLounge</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172967/">Selfoss</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172967/">Feed on feeds</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172967/">Managing news</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172967/">Lilina</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172967/">Tiny Tiny RSS</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172967/">Zebrafeeds</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172967/">Rnews</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172967/">NewsBlur</a> </li></ol><br>  All readers require PHP (except the latter - NewsBlur runs on python). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><a name="rssLounge"></a><br><h4>  rssLounge </h4><br>  It takes muscle to work, in general, the installation takes about five to ten minutes.  The OPML file was imported without problems, the subsequent loading of feeds also went off with a bang. <br><br>  Appearance: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1db/f42/0e8/1dbf420e8449a6ca5d2757bf1e037bc2.png"><br><br>  In addition, the ‚Äúimage only‚Äù view is available, in which all entries are displayed in tiles. <br>  Functionality is generally on top.  There is a calendar in which you can select a date (or a range of dates), it is possible to prioritize feeds and filter them accordingly.  You can configure authorized access and enable public read-only.  Even a bookmarklet is provided.  Entries can be added to favorites, and then they will not be deleted after a certain period of time (the term can be specified in the settings).  You can easily add feeds of devianart, twitter and tumblr users.  There is definitely one or two clients for android, but this, of course, is not always enough.

      A barrel of tar in a spoon of honey has become a strange job with Cyrillic.  At initial download, everything is OK, but the inclusion of any feed causes a crash - and all Cyrillic characters are displayed with question marks.  When viewing records, they are not automatically marked as read, this behavior cannot be changed in the settings.  Well and the main drawback: the project is no longer supported by the author - all his forces are now focused on Selfoss, which will be discussed below. <br><br>  Summary: handy, easy to install, fast RSS reader, with some unexpected features, and not having several expected. <br><br>  <a href="http://rsslounge.aditu.de/">Official</a> <a href="https://code.google.com/p/rsslounge/">Google Code</a> <a href="http://rsslounge.aditu.de/">Site</a> <br><br><a name="Selfoss"></a><br><h4>  Selfoss </h4><br>  Selfoss from the very beginning bribed me with its design.  Of the online beauty aggregators (this is my IMHO, of course) only Feedly can compare with it.  The installation took three minutes including the download of the distribution kit.  The program is ready for use immediately after downloading and installing the necessary rights to folders - all possible settings are optional.  You can use Sqlite (default) or MySQL as a database.  Google OPML clings, but with problems - about them below.  Hotkeys are almost the same as those in Google Reader. <br><br>  Standard view of the view (and there are no others, actually): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11c/3b2/e74/11c3b2e7458d2fea502bf2f81cfb7938.png"><br><br>  As I said above, Selfoss is the brainchild of the same developer as rssLounge, and he inherited some of the features of his predecessor.  For example, the ability to hook tapes on Twitter and Tumblr users, the ability to publicly access and add entries to your favorites and remove obsolete entries.  Hotkeys are the same.  Some minuses also migrated: for example, records are also not marked as read when viewed. <br><br><h6>  Disadvantages: </h6><br>  I have a little more than a hundred subscriptions in Google Reader.  When loading tapes, Selfoss each time dropped to 504 - and even raising the limits to some transcendental values ‚Äã‚Äãdid not help.  It is possible that these are temporary problems (or even local ones of my server, besides, I did not try to connect Selfoss to MySQL), but the sediment remained. <br>  The most important minus, in my opinion, is the inability to view a separate feed, you can only watch everything or by tags.  Also, the meaning of splitting the contents of an entry into three columns, regardless of its size, is somewhat incomprehensible: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95f/d40/2e3/95fd402e3901dd812cfaa7632622735d.png"><br><br>  In general, Selfoss leaves a very pleasant feeling, and there is hope that he will very quickly be able to get rid of childhood diseases and learn the skills of his predecessor.  The adaptive design made according to all canons is very pleasing - the service is quite convenient for use both on tablets and on smartphones. <br><br>  <a href="http://selfoss.aditu.de/">Official site</a> , <a href="https://github.com/SSilence/selfoss/">github</a> <br><br><a name="Feed"></a><br><h4>  Feed on feed </h4><br>  Pretty old reader - the last time it was updated in 2007, and so hung on version 0.5.  And yet. <br><br>  Appearance: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/919/43d/a7e/91943da7e023539a91f469cbb533aeb7.png"><br><br>  OPML was loaded quickly, but this is probably the only thing that can be said good about this reader.  Web 1.0, minimum JS.  The search for some advantages ended in nothing, since all subsequent launches of the main page tightly hung the chrome tab - everything loads at once, naturally.  But there seems to be a plugin for Wordpress. <br><br>  <a href="http://feedonfeeds.com/">Official</a> <a href="https://code.google.com/p/feed-on-feeds/">Google Code</a> <a href="http://feedonfeeds.com/">Site</a> <br>  PS There is still FeedOnFeeds-Redux - the FoF follower project, but it doesn‚Äôt do the weather: it is also hopelessly outdated. <br><br><a name="Managing"></a><br><h4>  Managing news </h4><br>  Based on the description on the site, Managing news is a powerful tool for collecting and analyzing news.  Its list of features includes: <br><ul><li>  Subscribe to RSS / Atom </li><li>  Ability to display news on the map </li><li>  News search </li><li>  Social functions and so on. </li></ul><br><br>  Appearance: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83f/d77/0e4/83fd770e474511f6be33534b7169585e.png"><br>  Managing news is based on Drupal.  It was not possible to install, because I didn‚Äôt want to connect to the database in any way, so I couldn‚Äôt do a detailed review here.  An interesting bun - widget code with the latest news, which can be embedded anywhere.  There is a bookmarklet. <br><br>  <a href="http://managingnews.com/">Official site.</a> <br><br><a name="Lilina"></a><br><h4>  Lilina </h4><br>  Appearance: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/075/c3e/e87/075c3ee87cbc6dd7c54dbbb789c52c74.png"><br><br>  Functions minimum: feed management (including autodiscover feeds), import OPML, view ... and ... everything.  Two complete plug-ins add the ability to save the post to instapaper and send a link to the post to your Wordpress blog.  By the way, about Wordpress.  It can be seen that the author was inspired by this engine, the built-in system of plug-ins and themes, the template tags the_content (), the_title (), etc., and even the address of the knowledge base - codex.getlilina.org transparently hints at this. <br><br>  Disadvantages: there is no possibility to mark the records as read, there is no search, there is practically nothing at all.  Not updated for more than a year. <br><br>  <a href="http://getlilina.org/">Official site</a> , <a href="https://code.google.com/p/lilina/">Google Code</a> , <a href="https://github.com/Lilina/Lilina">GitHub</a> <br>  PS There is <a href="http://lylina.sourceforge.net/">lylina</a> - sort of like the successor to lilina, but it was last updated in 2006. <br><br><a name="Tiny"></a><br><h4>  Tiny Tiny RSS </h4><br>  Appearance: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92d/25c/207/92d25c207db7c57a7cd36f4b5493966b.png"><br><br>  One of the most famous server-based RSS readers.  It has (in comparison with the others) a rather extensive community, it is regularly updated and full of functions.  The only one of all products presented in the review has a Russian-language interface. <br>  Included are a couple of dozen plug-ins that add a mobile interface, hotkeys like in Google Reader, an auto updater, a bookmarklet and the ability to publish entries in G +, Pocket and Twitter. <br>  It supports multiplayer mode, there is a mobile version, an application for Android, search and much more. <br><br>  Looking ahead, I will say that despite its name, this reader is the most advanced and functional of all presented in the review. <br><br>  <a href="http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki">Official site</a> , <a href="https://github.com/gothfox/Tiny-Tiny-RSS">github</a> <br><br><a name="ZebraFeeds"></a><br><h4>  Zebrafeeds </h4><br>  Absolute minimum of functions - the project was originally intended for further dopilivaniya, customization and integration and, as can be seen, it is absolutely not suitable for use out of the box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ed/996/6ba/1ed9966ba435d10fd5b416c1e6bbbd94.png"><br>  <a href="http://www.cazalet.org/zebrafeeds/">Official site</a> , <a href="https://github.com/lcazalet/zebrafeeds">github</a> <br><br><a name="Rnews"></a><br><h4>  Rnews </h4><br>  A pretty advanced reader, but the project stalled, unfortunately, back in 2009 (however, there is still some activity <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rnews/forums/forum/286469">on the forum</a> ).  For some reason, I didn't want to get up on my server, so the screenshot from the official site: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/191/739/e32/191739e326721f1c8b437a257dd1566d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Features: multi-user mode, public access, multiple views, rubrication, OPML-import and so on - everything that you usually expect from an RSS-reader. <br><br>  In general, if the project did not die, it would be a very good competitor to Tiny Tiny RSS. <br><br>  <a href="http://rnews.sourceforge.net/">Official site</a> <br><br><a name="NewsBlur"></a><br><h4>  NewsBlur </h4><br>  To test NewsBlur, it is not necessary to install it, there is a full-featured demo on <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/">the project site</a> .  Functionality at a height: in addition to the standard features of this kind of software, NewsBlur allows you to view entries in the form of bare text, in the feed and in the original design.  Great emphasis is placed on socialization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74a/944/8ae/74a9448ae797bfa756ba060fc6e223dc.png"><br><br>  In general, the functionality is almost the same as the GReader features, however, in my opinion, the interface is very much overloaded with unnecessary elements. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/">Official site</a> , <a href="https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur">github</a> <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  In the final table I decided to reduce only those readers that are actively supported (+ rssLounge - the functions that it contains are most likely to be transferred to Selfoss) <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  rssLounge </td><td>  Selfoss </td><td>  Tiny Tiny RSS </td><td>  NewsBlur </td></tr><tr><td>  Last update </td><td>  2011-02 </td><td>  2013-03-16 </td><td>  2013-03-15 </td><td>  2013-03-17 </td></tr><tr><td>  Requirements </td><td>  PHP, MySQL, Apache </td><td>  PHP, MySQL / PostgreSQL / Sqlite, Apache / Ngnix / lighttpd </td><td>  PHP ‚â• 5.3, PostgreSQL / MySQL (InnoDB, ‚â• 5.0) </td><td>  Python, Fabric, MySQL / PostgreSQL, MongoDB </td></tr><tr><td>  OPML import </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Import starred.json and shared.json </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not yet) </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  <nobr>Public mode (read-only)</nobr> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Judging by the official site, there are </td></tr><tr><td>  Multi-user support </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Community activity </td><td>  <a href="http://rsslounge.aditu.de/forum/">Low</a> , the author no longer supports the project. </td><td>  <a href="http://selfoss.aditu.de/forum/">Medium</a> , development is conducted mainly by the author </td><td>  <a href="http://tt-rss.org/forum/">High</a> </td><td>  Development is carried out by the author </td></tr><tr><td>  mobile version </td><td>  Not </td><td>  There is a very decent responsive design. </td><td>  There are several options </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  Android client </td><td>  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rsslounge-droid/">there is</a> </td><td>  Not </td><td>  At least two </td><td>  <a href="https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/tree/master/media/android/NewsBlur">there is</a> </td></tr><tr><td>  IOS Client </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td><td>  In developing </td><td>  <a href="https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/tree/master/media/ios">there is</a> </td></tr><tr><td>  Automatic update </td><td>  cronjob </td><td>  cronjob </td><td>  demon cronjob </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Plugin support </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Native, complete about 20 </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  Delete old records </td><td>  <nobr>Customizable</nobr> </td><td>  <nobr>Customizable</nobr> </td><td>  <nobr>Customizable</nobr> </td><td>  Settings did not find </td></tr><tr><td>  Adding notes </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Add to favorites </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Sharing </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td><td>  There is a public RSS, sharing in G +.

Selfoss seems quite promising - given the good functionality of its predecessor, there are hopes that Selfoss will become a glamorous Tiny Tiny RSS by the time Google Reader is closed.  All other participants in the review are either completely non-functional or no longer supported.  I do not pretend to complete coverage of the entire range of self-hosted solutions, so if someone offers a couple of alternatives, I will be happy. <br><br>  For me personally, Tiny Tiny RSS has become the undisputed leader - even though it lacks Selfoss (or Feedly) looks, this is the most advanced and convenient RSS reader of all that I have tested, and, apparently, I will use it. <br><br>  Finally, the survey: </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172967/</a></p>
