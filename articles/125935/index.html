We are a modern international payment service provider PayOnline. <br><br>  If your job,% username%, is related to e-commerce, you sell something on the Internet or develop the functionality of customer resources - you are faced with the issue of accepting payments on websites.  We have more than once ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/moedelo/blog/92202/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pay_system/88608/">2</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/skydns/blog/124058/">3</a> ) been mentioned on Habr√© in the course of lively discussions regarding the acceptance of payments on sites and the advantages of various payment service providers: processing centers and payment aggregators. <br>  Today we decided to tell how in less than 3 years we occupied 5.2% of the payment processing market in Runet (according to PayOnline analysts based on the data: the volume of the Internet payment market in Russia in 2010 was $ 3 billion, the processing turnover PayOnline Center - $ 155 million). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In our business, technology is very important, it is important to "do it now" and "do it for the future."  To "do it now" - you need to listen and hear our users - and make the system the way it needs them.

      In 2009, we looked at the market, there was a demand, there were fewer offers, there was a lot of criticism for the existing decisions ... with the participation of Microsoft.  The peculiarity of our scoring system lies in the complex principle of screening out suspicious transactions.  For example, it has no chance of successful payment from China, made by a resident of France using a bank card issued in America - with delivery to Zimbabwe.  With the development of the system, specialists have implemented the ability to manually configure security filters, allowing you to fine-tune the security system capabilities for the client‚Äôs business. <br><br>  In general, it <b>all started with 3 people and a site of 3 pages</b> .  First of all, we received a PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) certificate, were certified in international payment systems Visa and MasterCard and became participants in the MasterCard Site Data Protection Program and Visa Cardholder Information Security Program.  Over time, TransCreditBank, Master-Bank, Bank of Moscow, MBRD, VTB 24, Global Payments (UCS), WireCard Bank became partner banks of our processing center. <br><br>  And then the fun began - we began to connect customers!  Of course, first small, then medium and, finally, large, well-known (of the latter - Mamba.Ru, ESET NOD32, Kupibonus).  Over the past year, we have noticeably grown up, many large and reputable companies have appeared in our client base, and the turnover of the company has grown by several orders of magnitude. <br><br>  We started to work by offering everyone a common, universal solution with identical functionality for all customers.  Now this solution is called Pay-Standard and offers payment acceptance by credit cards, WebMoney, Qiwi, etc.  And the percentage varies from 2% to 5% depending on the company's turnover. <br>  Then we developed a product for our clients from the tourism industry.  Integrated with such ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù of the tourist market as Libra, USC, TravelLine, Amadeus, TAIS, TravelPort, Megatec, GP Solushions ... And in general, we tried and continue to try to make the lives of customers easier, and cooperation is more productive. <br><br>  Then we realized that customers want to combine the advantages and security of the processing center with the ease of integration of the payment aggregator.  For lovers of simplicity and speed, the ‚ÄúPay-Start‚Äù solution was launched - simple as an aggregator, reliable as a processing center, fast and understandable.  His commission percentage is fixed at 4%, and the connection period is minimal.  And all the most delicious - saved: multilingual call-center, detailed reporting, many payment instruments, high level of security. <br><br>  The latest, but already sought-after development of our team, was the Pay-Mobile payment tool, focused on accepting payments directly from mobile applications.  The client can pay for purchases in one click. To do this, you need to enter card data only for the first time.  Our payment security system has experienced another, now mobile ‚Äúlevel-up‚Äù.  The product was announced only in April, and now we are ensuring the processing of mobile applications <a href="http://idealprice.ru/iphone/">IdealPrice</a> , <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/kupibonus.ru/id449845103%3Fmt%3D8">Kupibonus</a> , <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dorg.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.network.litres">FBReader</a> , <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/smartive/id439230969%3Fmt%3D8">Smartive</a> .  And we are ready to move on - our payment solution is already supported by mobile platforms <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_iOS">iOS</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android">Android</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone">Windows Phone</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian">Symbian</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_ME">Java ME</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bada">Bada</a> . <br><br>  Now, after 2 years of intensive work, PayOnline occupies 5.2% of the market.  We are continuously developing our services, focusing on the feedback received and modern security requirements.  The quality of the work of customer support services and card holders is growing, the circle of partners is expanding.  We actively participate in specialized events, exhibitions, seminars, webinars, round tables (come to visit) - and are ready to make contact.  In the spring of this year, we organized and successfully held a competition of business projects in IT and e-commerce <a href="http://www.new-business-idea.ru/">New Business Idea</a> .  We strive to help interesting technology start-ups to achieve success in the most difficult areas - and we know for ourselves that this is possible. <br><br>  Michael Jordan said: "Talent wins the game, and the team - the championships."  Our team is our strength, and the key to effective development is the matrix management system.  In projects, apart from HR, lawyers, financiers, call-center, 32 specialists are involved, mainly sales, IT, marketing.  We work in Russia: the water polo champion, the guitarist of the TheMorningside group, the ACM / ICPC Olympiad participants, the landscape design specialist, the ecologist-nature user, two swimming masters for swimming, the big-eyed girl, the blonde with three higher educations, the avid tree-grower VocalTrance DJ, several professional mafia and a couple of bikers :) <br><br>  We also have a corporate football team, and during the friendly matches for this summer we met in the open field with the players of Kaspersky and Philips.  On weekends we ride bicycles and rollerblades around Moscow, and annually destroy internal corporate conflicts in paintball wars. <br><br>  <b>In general, we develop, live and communicate!</b> <br><br>  In the future, we plan to talk more about our scoring transaction monitoring system;  about the logic of the scoring system;  How to get PCI DSS certified  how to advertise and promote new payment methods that boost sales;  how to prepare your site to connect to the processing center ... And, of course, ask your questions about the features of the processing center.  The most interesting will serve as a topic for future interesting and useful posts! <br><br>  <b>Write!</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  <b>UDP</b> : As recommended by andrei202, links to mobile apps have been added. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125935/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125935/</a></p>
