The prize is an invite to habr! - completed</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/081128/L1NRLwklZP.png" alt="image"><br><h2>  The contest is over, below is the original content, below are the answers. </h2><br>  Good evening harbouzers and habrouzershi.  Special greetings to guests reading Habr but not having a registration on it. <br>  Why?  Every day, 5-10 new people are registered in Habr√©, I‚Äôm sure that there are much more people who want to, but the UFO is not as generous to invites as many would like. <br><br>  Today, you have a chance to get yourself an invite to Habr!  But it will not be so simple. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you should be aware, habrainwhite is a picture-square, consisting of 4 smaller squares.  The colors of these 4 squares determine the invite itself.  Therefore, the contest quest will be divided into 4 stages, the answer to each of which will be one of the colors of the invite (or rather its hex code) <br><br>  Looks like this:

    <img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/081128/wUHGxbZL36.png"><br>  (24x24 png square, the color of each of the 4 pieces is the answer to the tasks, not necessarily in the same order!) <br><br>  Rules of conduct: the competition can participate as "guests" Habra, and regular users (it would be foolish to prohibit).  If you do not need an invite, and you have solved all the riddles - you can check it on the registration page, BUT do not register an account, leave it to the one who needs it.  Of course, you can win an invite not for yourself, but for your boyfriend / girlfriend.  If you have all guessed and registered - let me know that the others do not suffer :) Then I will sign all the answers.  It is categorically forbidden to help the participants in the comments in any way - it will not be interesting. <br><br>  <b>Tasks of the competition</b> ! <br><br>  <b>Task number 1.</b> <br>  It is very simple, you need to go to my page and see the first color of the invite. <br>  - <b>Hint</b> : see <br>  - <b>Another hint</b> : look, squares - garbage! <br>  - <b>Another tip</b> : well, look! <br>  You can check your answer here: <a href="http://annecto.ru/test.php">annecto.ru/test.php</a> <br><br>  <b>Task number 2.</b> <br>  23191218 <br>  Tip - Try This <br>  - <b>Tip</b> : graphics <br>  - <b>Another tip</b> : color <br>  You can check your answer here: <a href="http://annecto.ru/test.php">annecto.ru/test.php</a> <br><br>  <b>Task number 3.</b> <br>  This is a complex task with 6 questions (line by question): <br>  1) How many programmers live between Andropov and Rybinsk? <br>  2) <a href="">pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/081128/tUUIdnTQMY.png</a> <br>  3) There are so many of them, and they are holy for robots! <br>  four). <br>  5) how not to build, does not change <br>  6) the head of the Egyptian (Phoenician) bull <br><br>  - <b>Hint</b> : Hieroglyphs, Morse, Berail, Isaac <br>  - <b>Another Tip</b> : Alphabet, Mathematics, Alphabet, Names and Titles <br><br>  Remember that the answers to these questions can only be numbers from 0 to 9 and the letters a, b, c, d, e, f - this is a hex code! <br>  This is a really difficult task, so by answering 6 questions you can check yourself by clicking the link Check Your Answer here: <a href="http://annecto.ru/test.php">annecto.ru/test.php</a> (by entering your answers - numbers and <b>small</b> Latin letters). <br><br>  Well, today is Friday, so;) <br>  <b>Task number 4.</b> <br> <a href=""><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/081128/thumbs/7VAT5Ikv3s.png"></a> <br>  Hint - I drive a highway with a trailer x without <br>  - <b>Hint</b> : Traffic <br>  - <b>Another tip</b> : intersection <br>  - <b>Another tip</b> : beer is also in business!  the truth is somewhere near! <br>  You can check your answer here: <a href="http://annecto.ru/test.php">annecto.ru/test.php</a> <br><br>  If you have collected an entire invite - you can try it here <a href="http://annecto.ru/test.php%3Fans%3Dxxxxxxyyyyyyzzzzzzeeeeee">annecto.ru/test.php?ans=xxxxxxyyyyyyzzzzzzeeeeee</a> - instead of characters, you need to substitute your 24 characters (6 of each answer, numbers and <b>small</b> Latin letters) <br>  If the tasks are too complicated, I will start giving hints.  There is no point in asking me for answers personally or asking for clues.  Please do not discuss the solution of tasks in the comments!  And good luck to you! <br><br><h2>  Attention!  Below are the answers! </h2><br>  Task number 1. <br>  go to my page and see the first color invite <br><br>  It was a fairly easy, but not obvious task!  I think my website found everything - it's not difficult to guess that it is nooze.ru - there is a picture of a cat (I pasted it myself! :) and with squares above it.  Of course, everyone rushed to the colors of the squares, but in fact the correct color was near the eyes of the ‚Äúkotofey‚Äù (blue - 147fbe).  The word was seen in the text of the assignment and hinted at the eyes. <br>  Later prompted - see - just a hint at the eyes and their color <br>  Even later, a hint - look, squares - garbage!  - again a hint at the eyes (see) and the uselessness of the squares with flowers <br>  Another tip: well, look!  - we finish emphasis on eyes <br><br>  Task number 2. <br>  23191218 <br>  Tip - Try This <br><br>  You need to know the basics of graphics - these numbers are the components of RGB of the desired color.  The total number of options is 2 - 231.91,218 and 23,191,218 - there cannot be others, since  each number cannot be more than 255. How was it to choose from?  Hint - Try This, this is one of Pink's albums (pink).  One of the flowers is pink, the second is very far from it.  As a result, we get the color e75bda <br>  Later given a hint - graphics <br>  A later tip - color <br><br>  Task number 3. <br>  This is a complex task with 6 questions (line by question): <br>  1) How many programmers live between Andropov and Rybinsk? <br>  A question with humor.  The correct answer is 0. Andropov and Rybinsk is the old and new name of the same city.  "Between them," of course, no one lives <br>  2) pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/081128/tUUIdnTQMY.png <br>  This picture shows the letter of the Braille alphabet (haptic alphabet for the blind) - this is the letter V. Since V cannot be, it was necessary to figure out that Roman V is Arabic 5 <br>  3) There are so many of them, and they are holy for robots! <br>  Of course, almost everyone guessed about the 3 laws of robotics Isaac Asimov <br>  four). <br>  Very funny question :) On Morse code a dot (short signal) means the letter e <br>  5) how not to build, does not change <br>  This is from mathematics - a unit erected to any degree is still a unit <br>  6) the head of the Egyptian (Phoenician) bull <br>  Difficult question - in the hieroglyphs of Phoenician and Egyptian writing, the head of a bull meant the first letter of the alphabet - alef - a <br>  As a result, we get 053e1a <br>  Clues revealed the "key" moments of all questions, were given twice <br><br>  Task number 4. <br>  Photos with beer.  No wonder the tip was ‚ÄúI'm on the highway I drive something with a trailer x that without‚Äù: <br>  according to the rules of traffic rules - a car with a principle can move on a highway no more than 90 km / h, without a trailer 110 km / h.  The attentive reader will notice the ‚Äúx‚Äù in the tooltip, some people thought it was a typo, but it wasn‚Äôt against the rest) - it is also the desired one.  The point is under the intersection of these coordinates (just below).  Many were looking for her right in these coordinates, but in vain, the point hid nearby. <br>  Later a hint was given - traffic rules. <br>  Still later - the intersection (hint at the intersection of the coordinates x and y). <br>  Another tip: beer is also in business!  the truth is somewhere near!  - hint that the photo is not just there and that the point is not necessarily right at the intersection of coordinates <br><br>  Compiling from all the answers, the sequence is 2-1-4-3, we get e75bda147fbe55e6c5053e1a - this is the desired combination. <br><br>  Thanks to all those who participated, and to those who did it not for the sake of invites, but because they were interested.  Congratulations to the winner of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/altair4eg/" class="user_link">altair4eg</a> (I think that he deserved a bit of karma to begin with, his way to the habr was not easy). <br>  It took about 6 hours to solve the quest (with periodically added tips).  It was a hard fight, but I think you came here for this.  Thank you for your attention, see you later! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45743/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45743/</a></p>
