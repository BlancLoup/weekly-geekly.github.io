  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to ask a question to your colleague?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A friend of mine recently complained that he often observes how our colleagues repeat the same mistakes.  These mistakes he himself often made in the past and sought to get rid of them for a long time.  From this he had a desire to share some of his rules, which help to win the loyalty of colleagues and receive detailed answers to their questions. <br><br>  In general, this is just information for thought, and, probably, one should not take everything written literally, but it is worth adapting them to everyone ‚Äúfor themselves‚Äù. <br><br>  So, 7 golden rules in distracting colleagues with requests for help: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. No need to greet.  No not like this.  <b>Do not send the word "hello" and wait for you to answer</b> .  It may take you a long time to print a question for which you are starting a conversation.  Therefore, you should take care of the interlocutor and not distract him from important matters ahead of time.  Perhaps the work in which he is engaged requires a full immersion, and he will unwittingly have to wait until you finish not to be taken out of work again.  If your upbringing does not allow you to miss a greeting, then send it no sooner than you print your question completely.

      2. <b>Never ask if you can ask a question</b> .  It's not fair.  Having answered it in the affirmative, the questioner secretly signs with his conscience an obligation to respond on the merits.  To answer negatively, without hearing the question itself is impolite, and therefore no one likes to do so.  Ask a question immediately.  Read the question and assess their capabilities ask the no problem.  If the questioner has no time or answer to your question, he will tell about it himself. <br><br>  3. <b>Do not send paragraphs as you write</b> .  There is no need to send your question in several receptions, when it can be sent in one message.  If you break the question into several messages, then at best, the person asked has to drop all his business and wait for you to finish.  And in the worst case (for you), the person asked will not wait until you finish.  He will go about his business, and maybe he will read your question later. <br><br>  4. <b>A correctly asked question is half the answer</b> .  Describe your problem in detail (in a reasonable degree, naturally).  First, very often the question itself disappears even at the stage of its formulation.  Thus, you will save both your time and your colleague's time.  Secondly, it is impossible to give an exact answer to a vague question.  But you really need the exact, aren't you? <br><br>  5. <b>Make sure you call a spade a spade</b> .  Many terms live only in your head or are practiced only in your team.  Do not lock yourself in your little world.  Before describing a phenomenon or entity that you have never described before, open Wikipedia for reference and find out what it is called to call it in the rest of the world. <br><br>  6. Make sure that your interlocutor has all the data he needs to answer your question.  <b>If you know the details that may be important, but not obvious, do not be too lazy to tell about them to the interlocutor</b> .  Your goal is to combine your knowledge and knowledge of the interlocutor to solve a complex task, and not to play the Erudite game with him. <br><br>  7. <b>If you managed to find the answer to your question first, do not forget to report this to the person you asked</b> .  This will allow him not to waste time and add loyalty to you if you turn to this person with a different question in the future. <br><br>  This is, in general, an uncomplicated list of rules that can greatly facilitate the life of you and your work colleagues.  What rules do you follow in communication with your colleagues? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285832/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285832/</a></p>
