But we live where we live, and the quality of television leaves much to be desired, so I bought the Popcorn Hour A-110 HD player (BBK clone reviews on Habr√©: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/66460/">one</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/66655/">two</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/73051/">three</a> ).  As it turned out, the piece of iron has several problems that were rarely talked about on forums, moreover, I did not consider some of them problems.  So now I will tell you what I ran into and how I struggled with it. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/90/59/a7/2888776/0/nmt.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Caution, traffic and mnogobukaff</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, I was going to use the built-in torrent rocking.  But it turned out that she didn‚Äôt want to download anything at a normal speed, I didn‚Äôt manage to squeeze more than 250-300 kilobytes per second, on a twenty-megabyte channel.  Besides, she looked like this: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <img src="http://img2.pict.com/e8/e7/19/2888725/0/torrent.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Secondly, the popcorn connected to a local network rustled with a hard disk at night.  Maybe my hearing is too sensitive, but I can't sleep in the same room with a rustling and clicking box. <br><br>  Thirdly, the logic of the menu began to enrage me.  You must first select a disk, then choose what I will watch (movies, photos, files, music) through this menu: <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/34/c8/72/2888720/0/chooser.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then it throws me into the overview of the root of the hard disk, which means that you have to select a folder, and only then select a file.  At the same time, I have a movie in the Movies folder, a photo in Photo, and so on (The player offers this folder structure itself, and it is difficult to change it, since the folder is re-created when you reboot. That is, I will always have a Music folder, although I‚Äôm I'm not listening).  I just want to click on the "Cinema" icon and get into the folder with the movie. <br><br>  A bit of Chinese menu design and small brakes while controlling the console were not really annoying for me.  Another brand front panel, and the remote need to aim directly at the device, but these are minor things, in principle. <br><br>  So, then I went to the official forums and found out a few things: <br>  - The machine works under linux <br>  - Software can be delivered to the device, but not all software for linux works correctly due to the architecture. <br>  - There is a <a href="http://www.networkedmediatank.com/wiki/index.php/Community_Software_Installer">program</a> that installs on popcorn software. <br><br>  First of all, I installed an ssh server.  I dig through the folders, I wish I didn‚Äôt do it - it turned out that the entire player interface was written in PHP and given to apache.  In addition, I expected the software to be neatly and meticulously folded into folders, but in reality everything was slightly wrong: <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/c8/f4/72/2888722/0/cnsl.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, I put a fresh version of the Transmission torrent client, the old 1.21 is out of the box in the player, I installed 1.8.  At the same time, all software is placed parallel to what is on the device, because when booting, a USB flash drive with firmware is mounted, everything is copied into RAM and when you turn off or restart, all changes are lost. <br>  It turned out that if Transmission reaches a download speed of more than 800 kb / s, everything hangs tightly.  Ok, this is not 300. Configured.  It is worth noting that only it has a scheduler that prohibits downloading files at night, and this was very important for me, since I wanted to sleep. <br>  There is also an option to install an older version 1.7 or another ctorrent client, but there was no scheduler in them. <br><br>  Next, I turned off all unnecessary services in the settings, like the old transmission and some casgle. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/d9/10/52/2888724/0/services.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Checked  If you turn on and turn off the player at 10:05 pm, then at night everything will work as I want, that is, be quiet. <br>  Then I slightly finished the scripts so that the hard disk would go to sleep at 10:05 pm crown. <br><br>  It remains to defeat the logic of the menu.  Here I was helped by the fact that if you put the index.html file in the root of the hard disk, it will replace the part of the device menu that is responsible for choosing what I want to watch.  I found a pretty good topic that allowed me to do exactly what I want - I choose what I want to watch, I immediately throw it into the right folder.  Having finished it with a file (It significantly slowed down quite a bit), I got practically what I wanted. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/4e/35/20/2888723/0/final.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, the menu looks nice and comfortable.  No need to choose a folder every time. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to say that if I knew what I was going to face, I would have taken another player.  If you don‚Äôt download torrents, the functionality is enough, and the player will delight, delight and delight again. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84756/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84756/</a></p>
