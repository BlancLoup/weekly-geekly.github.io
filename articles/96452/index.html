    <img src="http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/5060/52617002.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Frame </h4><br>  The frame is made of polypropylene sheets: two horizontal (substrates) and two vertical (cheeks).  Polypropylene has a density of 0.9.  Additional buoyancy also provides a foam plate.  Overall dimensions of the frame 600x510x400 mm. <br><img src="http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/5687/25228611.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/5800/19606597.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Propulsion and steering complex (DRC) </h4><br>  The propulsion and steering complex consists of eight propulsion units, four of which are aimed at creating thrust in the horizontal plane (course, course, lag), and four for thrust in the vertical direction and compensating for the response of the communication cable.  The specified number of movers was chosen in order to ensure high performance and the ability to perform mission tasks. <br>  The propeller is a brushless motor located in a hermetically sealed housing with a streamlined shape, at the end of the output shaft of which a propeller with a diameter of 100 mm is mounted, protected by a nozzle.  This nozzle also has the function of a water jet.  The choice of this variant of the engine is based on the requirements for mass (650 g), consumed electric power (120 W) and operational reliability. <br><br><img src="http://img251.imageshack.us/img251/7333/10120204.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img88.imageshack.us/img88/8035/45397376.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The DRC control unit is located in four special strong containers (one container provides control of two propellers), which provides protection from the external environment.  Each container is completely sealed, and also has a water sensor, which gives a signal in case of container leakage. <br><br><h4>  Handling complex </h4><br>  A series of operations under water can be performed only if there is a handling device on board the TPA.  The main requirements for the manipulator are a load-bearing capacity of up to 1 kg in water, the ability to capture objects, including without landing on the ground, as well as a comfortable position during transportation. <br><br><img src="http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/7524/94685975.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The composition of the handling complex includes: <br>  1. The motor-reducer and the worm-reducer, located in the hermetic case and allowing to make smooth turn of the manipulator on a corner to 220¬∫; <br>  2. Grabber, allowing the capture of small objects from 1.45 to 40 mm in diameter with a compression force of up to 6.5 KGF; <br>  3. Pipe grabber, which increases the service area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe manipulator and allows you to capture objects without landing on the ground. <br><br><img src="http://img5.imageshack.us/img5/6667/14260320.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Video system </h4><br>  The video system includes: <br>  1. Luminaires (2 pcs.) (The light source is a cluster XLD-AC-007WHT of 7 super-bright white LEDs XL7090 with a brightness in the range of 56.8-62.0 Lm (current consumption 350 mA)); <br>  2. Wide-angle navigation video camera QNB209 (110 ¬∞, 0.003 Lux, 570 lines); <br>  3. Vertical video camera and PTZ video camera VM32HQ-B36. <br><br><h4>  Depth sensor </h4><br>  As a depth sensor, a pressure sensor KRT5-33 is used, providing pressure measurement at a depth of up to 40 m with an accuracy of ¬± 1%, which corresponds to the depth of the working range of measured dives 40 ¬± 0.4 m. The signal from the sensor to the control unit comes in analog form.  The appearance of the sensor is shown in the photo. <br><br><img src="http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/5717/88845929.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Sensors of water flowing inside the container of the device </h4><br>  The water leakage sensor is a copper conductor insulated from the container body.  The photo shows the orientation of the conductor relative to the body.  The conductor is a copper foil located on a glass-cloth-textolite base.  The distance between the conductor and the housing is 1 mm.  When water enters this space, a significant decrease in resistance between the plate and the container occurs, which causes the corresponding comparator of the electronic circuit to operate. <br><br><h4>  Additional devices </h4><br>  A hydrophone was installed on the device to measure the amplitude and frequency of sound under water.  A sampler for sampling from the bottom was also installed. <br><br><h4>  Control system </h4><br>  The device is controlled by a laptop running under the Windows operating system.  To connect the device and a laptop, a switching unit was created. <br>  The switching unit includes two TV tuners, which allows you to process two video signals coming from the unit.  Reading / sending data is carried out via USB-port, since  Currently, it is the most convenient and easy-to-use interface for external devices. <br>  To display all the incoming information and receive control commands, a Windows application in C ++ has been implemented.  Its capabilities include not only the display of the parameters of the device and two video streams, but also the parameters intended for successfully completing the tasks: displaying the sound parameters, displaying the temperature graph, time counter until the end of the mission, state of the leak sensors.  In addition, a log of the state of the device, recording video (or two video images) on the hard disk for further analysis.  For video compression, open-source codec xvid is used, which provides good quality and speed of recording. <br>  The device can be controlled using both the keyboard and the joystick, which is considered as the main control element.  Duplication provides greater reliability in the case of, for example, a broken joystick or keyboard. <br><br><h4>  Cable </h4><br>  The cable is the primary means for communicating the device with the surface, it is powered by the device and the exchange of information, sending control commands.  Also the cable provides the mechanical strength of the connection with the device.  A rubber tube with an outer diameter of 12 mm was used as the basis of the cable.  What allowed to contain the necessary wires: <br>  ‚Ä¢ coaxial cable RC-50 for video signal transmission to the surface <br>  ‚Ä¢ 2 wires for power supply to the device <br>  ‚Ä¢ RS-485 interface wires for machine control <br><br><h4>  Electronics </h4><br>  The control electronics of the device is located in an airtight, metal container of a cylindrical shape.  It protects electronic boards from pressure, water and mechanical stress. <br>  The container includes: a power board, controller cards, sensor boards, a hydrophone board, a video multiplexer, a video modulator and an induction compass ID-6. <br>  The power board converts input 48 V to 24 V, 12, ¬± 12 V, 5, ¬± 5 V, which are necessary to power the electronic systems of the device.  Also on it is a current regulator that feeds the LED lamps. <br>  The controller board is the heart of the control system.  It houses a microcontroller, which processes the received navigation data and sends it to the console, and hosts the CAN and RS-485 interface drivers.  The CAN interface is used for communication between the device components, and for RS-485 communication between the device and the control panel. <br>  The sensor board consists of a 16-bit ADC that converts analog signals from sensors into a digital code, and an angular velocity sensor and accelerometer.  Depth and temperature sensors are located in separate sealed containers.  A feature of the device is the use of the induction compass ID-6.  This type of compass is used in Russian helicopters, which indicates its high reliability and high immunity to interference. <br><br>  A video multiplexer selects a pair of necessary video signals, after which they are transmitted to a video modulator, where they are mixed into one signal.  This allows two video signals to be transmitted over one wire at a time. <br><br>  The hydrophone board is designed to amplify and filter the signal from the hydrophone from interference, and a DSP processor is located on it that performs a fast Fourier transform and transmits it to the surface equipment. <br><br><img src="http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6853/img7662j.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Build and debug process </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c6/e50/5e1/7c6e505e1bfc50626872a6b3d54aca66.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Frame and transport box</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f82/8d1/82f/f828d182fdcf711ceb18048b776481e9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Buoyancy blocks</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36d/ef9/440/36def9440e7018defba26c641f1c770a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Elements of the control system</i> <br><br><img src="http://img815.imageshack.us/img815/9619/p1000163.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Teamwork</i> <br><br><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/6695/p1000162t.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>View inside the frame</i> <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eN1m7zqkyis%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiui_2tGxxhofcWmxKmgxPS4eesCQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And finally, I would like to wish our team to perform successfully this year. <br>  Wishes can also be addressed to <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/moun/" class="user_link">moun</a> .
