  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Security Week 37: Windows patches will become more cumulative, Google vs. HTTP, vulnerability in MySQL</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f1/06f/e73/5f106fe73b2d472c9ec09fe939e3d25d.jpg" align="right">  Since October, Microsoft has been changing the update delivery policy for a number of operating systems ( <a href="https://threatpost.com/new-windows-patch-policy-at-odds-with-acceptable-risk/120491/">news</a> , <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsitpro/2016/08/15/further-simplifying-servicing-model-for-windows-7-and-windows-8-1/">post</a> on Technet).  In order to simplify the update process (and, probably, according to numerous applications of workers), Windows 7 and 8.1, as well as Windows Server 2008 and 2012, will be updated with one large patch once a month.  The advantages of this approach are obvious: just look at the date of the last update in order to understand the relevance of installed patches. <br><br>  The drawbacks are also obvious: the option to install patches will no longer be available, everything will be loaded and put in one piece.  If a patch turns out to be incompatible with the installed software or certain system settings, you can only refuse the entire monthly update immediately.  It is with the installation of choice that Microsoft plans to fight: after all, in fact, this approach leads to fragmentation, instead of one version of Windows, we have to deal with a dozen, which complicates both support and testing. <br><br>  However, one loophole remains: a cumulative patch includes both security updates and updates aimed at improving reliability.  You can select and install only security fixes and nothing else, but this option is designed for clients from large companies.  The new policy can go sideways when using specialized software with strict requirements for compatibility.  There are a lot of examples when the release of the patch broke: you can recall <a href="http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX205398">problems</a> with the software from Citrix after the update of Windows 10, or say the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview">configuration</a> system crashes through Powershell (here's an interesting point - the Microsoft left-hand link complains about the bugs of the right). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Changes to the Microsoft update policy reflect the current state of the battle between reliability and security.  The most reliable software that is not updated over the years, it is also the most insecure.  In a situation where the discovery of new vulnerabilities (and just bugs) is inevitable, you have to make a choice, and Microsoft makes a choice in favor of protection against hacking.  This is commendable, but after all, a curious situation turns out: every month a new set of patches for Android once again brings up the topic of fragmentation, and yet on desktops, this is a much more serious problem.  From a security point of view, the ideal scenario is the delivery of updates (at least patches) at the time they are ready (well, like in <a href="https://gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> ).  It is this strategy, with regular explosions of user discontent, that Facebook is using, for example.  Both ideal scenarios (maximum reliability or maximum safety) are unattainable, but the right balance must be sought.  It is not excluded that the experience of vendors of security software is useful here: due to the nature of their work, they have been sending updates several times a day for many years.

    <h3>  Discloses critical vulnerability information in Oracle MySQL and compatible products. </h3><br>  <a href="https://threatpost.ru/critical-mysql-vulnerability-disclosed/18077/">News</a>  Legal Hackers <a href="http://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Exploit-Remote-Root-Code-Execution-Privesc-CVE-2016-6662.html">research</a> . <br><br>  Researcher David Golunski from the Legal Hackers creative association this week partially revealed information about a serious vulnerability in Oracle MySQL, which also affects dependent products, in particular MariaDB and PerconaDB.  This news is a good supplement to the previous one and also raises the question of the need for a standard for both patch delivery and vulnerability disclosure.  MySQL bug (CVE-2016-6662, versions 5.7.14, 5.6.32 and 5.5.51 and earlier are subject to UPDATE: in versions 5.7.15, 5.6.33 and 5.5.52, the problem seems to have been quietly solved) allows you to embed bookmarks in the DBMS configuration files, which in turn can lead to the execution of arbitrary code during the next restart.  Vulnerability can be exploited both when there is access to the server or remotely, in the case of an insecure system configuration (write access to configs by the user mysql). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f6/be7/710/9f6be771094742b9be8a6a3dfcae93b6.jpg"></div><br><br>  More information about the scenario (rather nontrivial) exploitation of the vulnerability can be found at the link above.  The important point is that the software already has patches, but for MySQL itself <s>- not yet, and probably it won't be until October 18th</s> .  The fact is that Oracle releases patches on a quarterly basis, and nothing will happen until the next release (the previous one in July <a href="https://threatpost.ru/oracle-patches-record-276-vulnerabilities-with-july-critical-patch-update/17323/">covered</a> 276 vulnerabilities).  The question arises - why did the researcher actually disclose the information before the release of the patches?  The arguments on this side are as follows: the vulnerabilities are closed in compatible software (which means an attacker can get information about the vulnerability by analyzing the changes), and 40 days have passed since the information was sent to the vendor. <br><br>  40 days is in this case definitely not an argument, but the release of patches of one hole by different vendors at odds seems to be really a problem.  It turns out that everyone is good.  Welcome to the wondrous new, highly irregular world of software security.  By the way, Oracle does not have a public reward program for the found vulnerabilities, and last year, CSO Oracle didn‚Äôt speak well of wythets at all - they say, there‚Äôs nothing to break our products without permission.  The post was quickly removed, but the sediment remained. <br><br><h3>  Google Chrome will mark HTTP-only sites as unsafe </h3><br>  <a href="http-sites-not-secure-in-2017/18068/">News</a>  <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/09/moving-towards-more-secure-web.html">Post</a> in a google blog. <br><br>  From January 2017, Google Chrome will begin to mark sites that provide connections only over an unsecure HTTP protocol as potentially unsafe.  Chrome now marks these sites as neutral (as opposed to secure, trusted connections using HTTPS), but Google rightly believes the situation should change.  The transition will be carried out in several stages, and in January only those sites that transmit HTTP passwords or credit card data (plain text!) Will become unsafe, which, of course, is very much beyond good and evil. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58f/dc9/cf9/58fdc9cf97264d5ba1042dd09b4ae578.png"></div><br><br>  The following is interesting in the post of the Google team: the reaction of users to various methods of sorting websites was checked by research, and, as expected, they only pay attention to the explicit message about the problem.  All the rest "you know, there may not be all good" are ignored.  I wonder how often explicit messages about insecurity are ignored?  Browser developers are thus face to face with an army of users, which is not at all required to understand the intricacies of network protocols.  As a result, it is necessary to reduce the long-term experience of protecting information in the network to something very simple and understandable: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Be1ZHRri78I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The next stage of the attack on the playtext Internet will be a warning about all HTTP sites in incognito mode, in which users, in theory, should care more about privacy.  And finally, Google plans to extend the policy to all HTTP connections for all users. <br><br><h3>  What else happened: </h3><br>  Meanwhile, Microsoft held the last weekly patch <a href="https://threatpost.ru/microsoft-patches-47-vulnerabilities-with-september-patch-tuesday/18114/">according to the old rules</a> . <br><br>  Troyan, disguised as a guide for Pokemon Go, dragged into Google Play.  <a href="https://blog.kaspersky.ru/pokemon-go-malware/13044/">500,000 downloads</a> . <br><br>  And for a snack - <a href="https://threatpost.ru/paroli-polzovatelej-qip-okazalis-v-internete/18007/">password leakage</a> from QIP plaintext. <br><br><h3>  Antiquities </h3><br>  "V-707" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a3/d84/77c/1a3d8477c94641beaa19694292d10b54.png" align="right">  Resident is not a dangerous virus.
