I'll start from afar, but I hope that Linux lovers will be interested.  I warn you at once: this is not holivar, but small-scale fans will not be very interested. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is a good rhyme-rhyme that is usually sentenced when massaging children: <br>  Rails, rails, <br>  Sleepers, sleepers, <br>  Rode the train late. <br>  Suddenly from the rear car <br>  Radioactive waste fell down. <br>  Penguins came running and pecked them. <br>  THROUGH THE WEEK HAS WORKED THE WHOLE WORLD !!! <br>  :-) <br><br>  Linux doesn‚Äôt pretend or practically doesn‚Äôt pretend to machines with different ‚Äúsevere‚Äù versions of unixes: IBM AIX, SUN Solaris, SCO UNIX, * BSD, etc.  They do their job well and nobody sees any reason to touch a working system.  Linux is installed where a fast, stable and often microscopic system is needed: in various pieces of hardware, instead of a small-scale product line and as micro-routers / proxy servers / web servers, etc.  I want to present to your attention a selection of achievements and applications of my beloved OS.

      November 11, 1999: In China, the Linux operating system is adopted as the official operating system of the People‚Äôs Republic of China.  And the Chinese make up almost a third of the world's population. <br><br>  Automatic <a href="http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/DIYCatFeederAndWaterDispenser.aspx">cat feeder</a> , running what axis?  Never guess! <br><br>  After the outbreak of the sasser virus, within a week, millions of servers were transferred to linux. <br><br>  When they want to praise a piece of hardware or a program, they say the phrase "she doesn‚Äôt make coffee‚Äù.  Linux even makes coffee!  <a href="http://www.linuxcenter.ru/lib/articles/hardware/coffee_howto.phtml">Linux cofee HOWTO</a> <br><br>  On Habr√© was already the news of a <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/robot/21633.html">giant cockroach running Linux</a> <br><br>  Motorola has introduced a new intelligent cell phone A760.  The main feature of this device is the use of the Linux operating system as a platform.  Additional applications - and the phone has the full functionality of a PDA - can be created in the Java language. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.cybersecurity.ru/news/7974.html">US military got a robot machine running Linux</a> <br><br>  There are a huge number of mini and micro distributions that fit on a floppy disk and perform a bunch of tasks.  For example ballantain: DHCP server, IP masquerading, NAT server and something else.  Requirements: drive, 386 percent, 4 mega RAM, network card and modem.  On the network, you install an old half-dead machine that distributes addresses to all workstations and, if necessary, connects to the Internet, starts a modem connection.  After setting up the program, you can sell the keyboard and monitor.  When i was moonlighting <br>  in one desk for 5 workstations, then I raised such a proxy server in 10 minutes, received my money and for 5 years this ‚Äútroika‚Äù worked until it burned down. <br>  Such distributions-on-diskette are full and very funny when small-sized ones with great fanfare declare the release of their ‚Äúmicrokernel‚Äù with a size of 25 meg.  True, it does not know how!  Yes, a little holivar still hell. <br><br>  Linux is installed on the <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS7438726816.html">onboard computer of a Mercedes S-Class</a> and generally instead of the driver.  Offhand, I did not find the link, but a couple of years ago I saw an article describing a car that, under Linux, drove 2,000 kilometers along Italian roads.  It was equipped with a GPS system, radars, a camera with an image recognition system. <br><br>  Did you know that nuclear warheads are practically already ‚Äúin the hands of‚Äù Linux?  <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS5358436389.html">Intercontinental missile transport vehicle</a> .  Do not hurt the penguins!  :-) <br>  <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT2717739661.html">A good selection of</a> robots running linux <br><br>  <a href="http://www.pervouralska.net/news/pc/index.php%3Fcont%3Dlong%26id%3D1417%26year%3D2005%26today%3D30%26month%3D03">The smallest Linux server</a> .  RJ-45 size connector <br><br>  Licensing policy of Microsoft has led to the fact that US schools <a href="http://www.compulenta.ru/2002/5/22/29961/">are switching to Linux</a> <br><br>  From a habr: German universities <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/linux/24247.html">pass to Linux</a> <br><br>  All smartphones <a href="http://www.cifrovik.ru/publish/open_article/8936/">will switch to Linux</a> <br><br>  Stock exchanges <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2008/02/20/288880">are moving to Linux</a> , Wall Street is <a href="http://www.compulenta.ru/news/2001/8/29/18160">switching to Linux</a> , Cities and countries <a href="http://citkit.ru/articles/49/21.html">are switching to Linux</a> .  A few more lines for posting on Yandex: <br>  "French police is completely moving to Linux" <br>  "Oracle moves to Linux" <br>  ‚ÄúPentagon Switches to Linux‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúThe Bundeswehr intends to abandon the use of Microsoft‚Äôs programs in the department‚Äôs most secret computers‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúCuba is moving to Linux‚Äù <br>  "Schools Petersburg will go to Linux" <br>  ‚ÄúStores are switching to Linux‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúJapanese schools will switch to Linux‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúDell moves to Linux for users‚Äù <br><br>  09/23/2007 Russia's national projects <a href="http://www.gzt.ru/hi-tech/2007/09/23/220222.html">are switching to Linux</a> .  And about.  First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev expects to solve software problems in Russia in three years.  In particular, due to the gradual abandonment of Microsoft services ... <br><br>  Do you still have Windows and you think that this system has captured the whole world?  The penguin has already come to you.  He is in your cell phone and microwave, he is in a DVD player and in a washing machine, are you traveling in an elevator or are watching porn from a Linux server on the Internet.  Penguins around you.  If you don't see them yet - just open your eyes! <br><br>  PS When I watched the movie ‚ÄúTerminator‚Äù, it was always interesting what the OS is in it?  Recently I installed the 8th Fedor, set the automatic wallpaper change in KDE, opened the console with a transparent background and started working.  With the next change of the background image and the parallel output of a listing in the console ... I realized that the T1000 is inside LINUX !!!  :-) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22959/</a></p>
