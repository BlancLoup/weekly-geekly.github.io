  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Godmode on?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most recently, we made a contest of articles "A <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/91865/">future without diseases and death</a> " - the result exceeded all expectations and more on that later.  Looking ahead - the topic turned out to be very difficult, so we decided to let the users breathe, taking a new and quite simple <a href="http://trendclub.ru/blogs/contest_aniver">anniversary photo contest</a> (the tradition of donating a laptop every month has been preserved). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/757/475/33d/75747533dcaebcea850ac0e774d133ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the cut, some visitors with genuine joy will see themselves in the lists of winners, and for all others we have made a small selection of links to the most interesting of the submitted works.  Get your electronic readers - today there is something to download and something to think about. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Contests on the <b>TrendClub</b> project <b>are</b> becoming more interesting once and again, and wins require more and more brain activity - it‚Äôs not for you to collect labels with covers and send sms from business phones.  There were lots of competitions: simple, funny, creative ... and this, April, turned out to be all at once - creative, difficult and, as it turned out, very serious.  As it turned out, the topic of immortality worries very many, but, as it seemed to me, not everyone has an idea what to do with this very immortality if it suddenly appears.  Apparently, from this ignorance and the lack of any goals in this situation, many participants formed some gloomy pictures about the future, which they painted in all colors.  Well, as it will be in reality - time will tell, but for now - it was nice to read different points of view, even if we expected something brighter and more positive.

      By the way, it is worth noting the fact that we were surprised by the number of works sent (as many as 257 pieces!) And the number of comments to them (in total - more than 5200) - this only means that the topic of the competition was not only interesting, but also offensive. for a living. "  And this, you know, is exactly what one wanted - because the project was created in order not only to think about the future, but also to see oneself in this future. <br><br>  The virtual pedestal was taken by three authors, whom we are waiting for for more than real prizes.  Pay attention to the difference in points on the photo finish - they literally go nostril to nostril. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d62/8e6/cf8/d628e6cf8cd9d78222a90d3a0c2c4bce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd7/e29/13e/cd7e2913e031ff8ccc02a232622bd27c.png" alt="image">  <b>1st place</b> : Autobiography ‚Äú <a href="http://trendclub.ru/blogs/contest_april/4159">Biomega</a> ‚Äù, by <b>Stas</b> ( <b><a href="http://trendclub.ru/users/Biomega">Biomega</a></b> ) <b>Liping</b> <br>  The prize is the <b><a href="http://trendclub.ru/3883">ASUS K52Jr</a></b> laptop on the new Intel Core i5 processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/033/eaf/475/033eaf475b0a12426fb494e90a83d700.png" alt="image">  <b>2 place</b> : The story " <a href="http://trendclub.ru/blogs/contest_april/4349">An excerpt from the diary ...</a> ", author <b>Roman</b> ( <b><a href="http://trendclub.ru/users/rscout">rscout</a></b> ) <b>Sinetsky</b> <br>  The prize is the <b>ASUS O!

On the other hand ... we hope that the light alone does not converge on the prizes alone - after all, to be heard, to cause serious discussions and to give rise to thoughts and thoughts in people's heads, this is something that you cannot buy in more than one store.  Therefore, in a separate paragraph I would like to recommend this work to be read in my free time: ‚Äú <a href="http://trendclub.ru/4425">The Tale of the Rejuvenating Potion</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://trendclub.ru/4505">About Eternity</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://trendclub.ru/4096">160 Years Later</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://trendclub.ru/4403">Singularity</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://trendclub.ru/4186">Psychology of Immortality.</a>  <a href="http://trendclub.ru/4186">Myths and fears</a> "," <a href="http://trendclub.ru/4522">The right to die</a> "," <a href="http://trendclub.ru/4485">Death, do not touch my drawings!</a>  "," <a href="http://trendclub.ru/4260">2102</a> "," <a href="http://trendclub.ru/4310">Die, Russian ...</a> "and" <a href="http://trendclub.ru/4204">Test eternity</a> . " <br><br>  And here is how our distinguished jury commented on the work of the participants: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be3/7e2/f59/be37e2f59e22fbccdb9805296efee461.jpg" align="left" alt="image"><h3>  Danila Medvedev </h3><br>  <b>Russian public figure, philosopher, futurologist.</b>  <b>Member of the Coordination Council of the Russian Transhumanist Movement.</b>  <b>Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Russian CryoRus Cryocompany</b> : <br><br>  It is evident that the authors who got into the final, tried very hard.  I, as a person who has been dealing with this issue for the past few years, undoubtedly sees all those issues that have been repeatedly resolved in the course of learning about this topic, disputes at seminars and online.  Unfortunately, I did not see anything new in the works.  Somewhere, technological freedom and conflicts arising in society are well revealed, but there is no artistic aspect.  In many works, anti-scientism, suicide, and emotional emptiness prevail.  In some, there is propaganda of esotericism incomprehensible to the authors themselves, or opposition of concepts that are in completely different planes and which cannot be compared at all, or their substitution at all.  And the overall impression of the work is quite gloomy.  However, it is a positive fact that people overcame a certain psychological barrier and seriously thought about old age and death.  And this is undoubtedly a plus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/658/519/0c1/6585190c11211a922f9ac79ae840d461.jpg" align="left" alt="image"><h3>  Alexey Turchin </h3><br>  <b>An expert on global catastrophes, the author of the book "The Structure of a Global Catastrophe"</b> : <br><br>  I evaluated the works not by ideological loyalty, but by the emotional response that they caused in me.  Still, it is immediately obvious how difficult it is to invent something new.  It is clear that the question of immortality goes in parallel with the question of filling life with real value (and not illusory, with the help of games).  The task of a qualitative extension of development due to many of its new steps is far from trivial.  And it is not separable from the task of achieving immortality. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/150/ce1/a01/150ce1a019dcbae418dd3f02eeab20fe.jpg" align="left" alt="image"><h3>  Yuri Nikitin </h3><br>  <b>Russian writer, author of the books "Transhuman", "I live in this body", "Passing through the walls", "I am a singular", "Singomeykery", "2024" and others</b> : <br><br>  Contestants only confirmed that it‚Äôs easy to kick the future and write that everything will be bad - but to say something positive is incredibly difficult.  That is why those little things where they look about the future with a negative look more alive and more literary, and where everything is good and everyone sings is boring and uninteresting.  I placed the grades and I hope that if the guys continue, they will learn to write better. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bcd/c92/a3c/bcdc92a3c4761582746e45eb3356ce03.jpg" align="left" alt="image"><h3>  Mikhail Batin </h3><br>  <b>Politician, founder of the public organization ‚ÄúFor the increase in life expectancy‚Äù, deputy of the Kostroma Regional Duma</b> : <br><br>  I must say, I was greatly disappointed by the work sent to the competition.  ‚ÄúEverything will be bad, terrible and boring‚Äù - the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost all authors.  Only the_3d6 reacted positively to the radical extension of life, but from an artistic point of view, the work was clearly disappointing.  As time is running out, I am sending estimates.  And I myself ponder why people see the future in black colors.  Maybe because on your site black color dominates? <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/312/a99/812/312a9981261c853a9e4cffa9217f8748.jpg" align="left" alt="image"><h3>  Denis Podolyak </h3><br>  <b>Editor-in-chief of Mobile Computers magazine</b> : <br><br>  ‚ÄúSince my time pressure continues (here it is, the problem, but not the mortality of a person :)), but the topic is deep enough, interesting and relevant - yes, yes, I believe that the topic of immortality and other forced and drug metamorphosis need to be discussed today (as they say, it‚Äôs not too late) - I decided to jot down the thoughts that arose during the reading of the texts.  Some of them are associated with works, and some have a rather general, abstract character: <br><br>  1. Too much negativity, too much fear (‚Äúfutureshock‚Äù in action?) Only ‚ÄúEgg‚Äù pleased, with its unexpectedness and positivity even in form. <br>  2. Separately, I would like to mention ‚ÄúThe tales of the new time‚Äù, ‚ÄúFragments from the diary‚Äù and ‚ÄúImmortality - is this all you can do?‚Äù.  Perhaps because they are close to me in their feelings.  Sadness (such a good sadness ... nostalgia?) On the past and at the same time waiting for a serene future that depends entirely on you. <br>  3. A lot of things revolve around ego, ‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äù.  But man is impossible without society ... <br>  4. There is no goal, no ideology.  Why do I need immortality?  In order not to look around, going over the street?  Or for a flight to distant stars? <br>  5. As long as humanity does not have a global, unifying, guiding goal - immortality will not help. <br>  6. Humanity, emotions, feelings - this cannot be among the immortals.  Immortals are not people.  Perhaps the gods, but no more. <br>  7. We have not yet dealt with ourselves, and we are already starting to create a ‚Äúnew person‚Äù <br>  8. Immortality is a ‚Äúsnag‚Äù, a fake, only a visible effect.  Long live a direct impact on space and time! " <br><br>  The only one who could not be reached was <b>Dmitry Glukhovsky</b> , the author of the post-apocalyptic novel ‚Äú <b><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE_2033">Metro 2033</a></b> ‚Äù - we hope that he will keep us company again and again in further events. <br><br>  Congratulations to the winners and finalists - good work!  Everyone else - read, discuss, feel free to take the initiative (in the same <a href="http://trendclub.ru/blogs/contest_aniver">anniversary competition</a> ).  And yes, do not hesitate to connect to the TrendClub <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/">blog</a> on Habr√© - because together we are strong;) <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94712/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94712/</a></p>
