Why is this business?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Development of mobile applications for business.  Does business need a mobile app? </h4><br>  I would really like to answer this question and help small firms that are still in the process of finding the answer.  In most cases, when I communicated with colleagues on the shop floor (mobile application development), I always asked them - And why did this company order a mobile application from you?  - because I really did not understand why to spend such money? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c65/c1a/108/c65c1a1085548cd190e732480a410428.png"><br><br>  In 90% of cases of our communication, the answers were as follows: <br><blockquote>  <b>To increase loyalty and image for the company, other companies do not have such applications, etc.</b> </blockquote>  It became interesting enough for me, because whatever tools were in business, everything must be done to increase sales.  It sounds rather rude, but I'm talking a little about something else.  A good quality product also boosts sales (a dress), and not just scripts and sales experience.  If you buy well, then you are doing everything cool and right (unless it is, of course, not a complete divorce, prohibited areas of activity, etc.). <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>The main problem is that most companies spend money on mobile applications, not at all assessing the effectiveness of these actions.</b>  When a business representative addresses me, I always try to help and solve the main problem - namely, sales increase.  <b>I‚Äôm not talking about large / large companies that really have the opportunity to pursue image strategies that ultimately affect the sale.</b>  <b>Most likely, they have already exhausted almost all possible channels of attracting customers with large ROI and are beginning to ‚Äúplay for the future,‚Äù where ROI is simply greater than zero.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Mobile application is not suitable for all businesses!  Often, for many companies, this is a certain investment that may pay off in the future and bring new revenue.  A direct indicator of the fact that you should not make a mobile application is the impossibility to calculate the effect of its development or it is quite difficult to do.  I would, after all, advise you to invest in something that can give more exhaust as an investment (large ROI).  For example, in a new product or in improving the quality of service. <br><br>  For a certain kind of niche, mobile apps are a super cool accelerator.  In such niches, the payback of a mobile application is easy to calculate and the efficiency is many times higher than the investment in development. <br><br>  <b>In mobile business applications, promotions and discounts work very well.</b>  For example, you deliver sushi (not only Yakitoria earns it).  To send Push-notifications (not advertising, it is prohibited in Push-notifications) at lunchtime or in the evening is a very effective method of increasing sales.  It is clear that this should be accompanied by a certain action with profitable offers for customers.  It is also impossible to do this often, otherwise the client will simply refuse your notifications completely.  Therefore, this should be done carefully and offer him a good product.  This is a completely new channel for increasing repeat sales using mobile apps.  You invest X, and the output is K * X revenue.  In the same way as advertising, no more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f88/e26/ea2/f88e26ea235b7d6896bcc127b80a13cd.jpg"><br><br>  Recently, I talked to a man who is engaged in block houses (the average check is 5 million rubles).  <b>How could a mobile app help its business and increase sales?</b>  I immediately had an idea about the possibility of making an augmented reality - you point at the land and see your house.  Cool?  Yes, but rather expensive and the investment most likely will not pay for itself at all.  And buyers in this case are most likely not the people who actively use mobile applications.  In this case, the mobile application does not help and will be completely doomed. <br><br>  Augmented reality from Ikea (she can afford it): <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/o6h7hpIaYoE&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhglM8Fn8g6HC2MR8U0L2HOWehkmzw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In some cases, the mobile application is given to the client, as a certain bonus to the purchase, which motivates him to return or advise your product to other people! <br><br>  This is suitable for those who sell certain goods to which the corresponding instruction is needed.  It is quite difficult to find a new client in such niches (jackets for individual tailoring or walkers for children).  But you can send a person very well by offering to download an application after the purchase, in which all the possibilities of truly interesting content will be open to him. <br><br>  Content that can be described in the application: <br><ul><li>  How an individually tailored jacket affects how you look in front of potential customers </li><li>  How to wear a jacket? </li><li>  How not to knead the jacket? </li><li>  How to transport a jacket? </li></ul><br><br><h5>  All this proves that you are an expert in your subject! </h5><br>  What good is this method: <br><ul><li>  Your client gets what others do not.  This is a huge plus for your company. </li><li>  The content of the application, which describes how to properly use your product, proves that you are a real expert in your business and, as a result, leads new customers in a sundress, perhaps even through a mobile application </li></ul><br><br>  The ideal mobile application is an application that will bring new income to your business!  Therefore, it is necessary to approach the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdeveloping a mobile application very carefully, namely, to evaluate the effectiveness of the invested funds. <br><br>  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212873/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212873/</a></p>
