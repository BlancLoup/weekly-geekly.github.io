Therefore, to obtain reliable information about modern scientific activities in Russia is not so easy.  Although the modern scientific community has something to show and talk about. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Our company has quite a few people from the scientific community who have worked (or still continue to work) in various institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences and state universities.  Therefore, the issue of supporting Russian science is so important for us.

    <h3>  Start </h3><br>  At the end of last year, JetBrains, together with the <a href="http://paperpaper.ru/">Internet newspaper Bumaga,</a> decided to organize <a href="https://vk.com/scienceslam">Science Slam Petersburg</a> .  The format was invented by the Germans a few years ago: five young scientists talk about their research, each has 15 minutes.  Everything happens in a club or bar, the audience is about 700 spectators.  Slamer's main task is to tell clearly and fun.  The best guests choose Science Slam applause.  And the sound level meter helps us to accurately determine the winner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ef/d4f/817/4efd4f817c2d397f2bd697912f80ed21.jpg"><br><br>  In truth, the expectations were modest: they wanted to organize pleasant entertainment for young scientists and interesting lectures for young people, to create the right alternative to alcoholic parties.  We did not think that <a href="http://lenta.ru/search%3Fquery%3Dscience%2Bslam">Lenta.ru</a> would write about the first slam, and reports from the event would be aired on city television channels. <br><br><h3>  Formula for success </h3><br>  Again, Russian society has a great need to understand what is actually happening in Russian science and what young scientists are doing.  Perhaps this explains the unexpected success of the Science Slam format.  Young people listen with pleasure about laser chemistry, genetics and astronomy.  Young scientists perform on every slam: funny, cool guys, the best proof that science is not boring.  By the level of questions that viewers ask the slammers, it is clear that the audience is thinking and interested. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9e/3f7/8fd/d9e3f78fdc5bfbde943e340148e5247c.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, our mission is not limited to the creation of a new type of leisure.  We organized a platform for public speeches of young scientists.  Now they have the opportunity to show that it is fashionable to do science, that their research is really important. <br><br>  Science is a rock-roll, and young scientists are new stars. <br><br><h3>  What's next? </h3><br>  We are not going to stop there.  Science Slam is exciting regions.  This Sunday, December 8th, the slam team will lead a scientific <a href="https://vk.com/science.slam.samara">battle in Samara</a> . <br><br>  We want to further enhance the image of young scientists and tell a wide audience about interesting research.  Interest in Science Slam is growing, and this means that we are taking the right steps. <br><br><h3>  And when is the next slam in Petersburg? </h3><br>  This Sunday, December 8, at 6 pm, the last Science Slam in 2013 will be held at the A2 A2 in St. Petersburg.  On the next slam, they will talk about neurophysiology, cryptography, digital production, the Internet of things and metamaterials.  In addition, we decided to open the battle with the speech of the dean of the Faculty of Economics of the European University Maxim Buev.  The scientific nature of the speeches will be assessed by the Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the head of the sector of the theoretical foundations of microelectronics at the Institute of Physics and Technology named after  A.F.Ioffe RAS, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582_%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Robert Arnoldovich Suris</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c37/527/474/c37527474879437bd4c31c2aca23aa20.jpg"><br><br>  To attend the event you need to <a href="http://scienceslam.timepad.ru/event/90934">register</a> .
