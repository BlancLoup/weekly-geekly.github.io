Well, except for the mythical 4k2k models, now for them there is neither content nor media for such content.  Difficult to answer?  Well then, we answer - the most unusual TV this year - LG EA9800. <br><br><img alt="Image #1709333, 407 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51e/9de/8c3/51e9de8c3f582bfbd6e60c693cf5314e.png" title="Image # 1709333, 407 KB"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Why? <br><br>  Probably because this is the first OLED TV in the world with a curved screen surface.  And it also uses a matrix with a WRGB subpixel arrangement, which has proven itself in the smartphones of Japanese manufacturers.  Specially designed organic light-emitting diodes, on the basis of which we make all our OLED-panels, allow us not only to make TVs with an incredibly thin display, but also (thanks to a diode arrangement) allow our engineers to experiment with the shape of the screen.  One of the results of such experiments was the LG EA9800.

This is the first TV in the world with such a set of characteristics, an unusual screen, stunning contrast and full support for the technology of forming a realistic 3D image - LG CINEMA 3D.  Conventional OLED TVs are close to perfection (brightness, color reproduction, lack of ‚Äúloops‚Äù and ‚Äúblurring‚Äù of the picture, excellent contrast), but even they have one problem - when watching movies, due to the peculiarities of the person‚Äôs visual receptors, when watching dynamic scenes The ‚Äúedges‚Äù of the screen lost in contrast and detail - this happens with absolutely all flat panels and the device of our eyes blames everything.  The curved screen also solves this slight hindrance - the LG EA9800 matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãdesigned in such a way that the entire display surface is equidistant from the viewer's eyes (provided it is installed at the correct distance from the viewing point), which allows to eliminate even the smallest visual distortions and loss of detail even in the most dynamic movie scenes. <br><br><img alt="Image #1709328, 420.8 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/826/7b3/80f/8267b380f4d2770f8a45562b897b1098.png" title="Image # 1709328, 420.8 KB"><br><br>  If we talk about the technology on which the matrix of the TV is built, this is the LG OLED WRGB - the latest generation matrix, which uses a four-pixel system with a white subpixel in addition to the usual RGB (red, green, blue) scheme, which is used to adjust the color palettes, reducing the load on the main subpixels when displaying shades close to white, increasing the brightness of the image and stunning contrast.  This system is supported by the ‚ÄúRefiner‚Äù color signal processing code, which provides video signal amplification, converts it to a form that is understandable to the control electronics of the matrix and controls the tone of the colors. <br><br>  The LG EA9800 model also boasts an unprecedented level of black depth, regardless of illumination, brightness and contrast of the picture, viewing angle, which is due to the design of the matrix itself: the backlight itself lacks subpixels, which means black is really black, and not closed in front of the lamp is an LCD shutter that transmits light. <br><br>  Another nice addition was the support of High Dynamic Range (HDR), which provides amazing detail on the entire field of the frame, both in ‚Äúdark‚Äù areas of it and in ‚Äúlight‚Äù areas.  The combination of all advanced technologies and one of the most innovative matrixes in the world provide maximum image quality and complete immersion in the cinema.  Alas, the pictures do not convey this, but we hope to bring the TV to our flagship store on the 6th floor of the Lotte Plaza shopping center as soon as possible. <br><br><img alt="Image #1709327, 490.6 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/257/20b/0d1/25720b0d18f07a9945d097bce768f27a.png" title="Image # 1709327, 490.6 KB"><br><br>  But not only the OLED-matrix makes this model unique.  The materials of the body are chosen to match the main element in the TV - the screen.  Carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic is used to produce the body of the TV, which makes the TV extraordinarily light.  The stylish and sleek design of LG Paper Slim is a separate pride of our industrial designers.  It combines the screen and stand into an aesthetically inseparable whole.  At the same time, due to the use of the CINEMA SCREEN design elements, the TV has a very thin frame, almost imperceptible for everyday life.  In order to make the installation more versatile, the new model comes with a convenient wall mount that allows you to install a TV for one person.  Due to the fact that there is a gap of less than an inch between the wall and the TV, the LG design masterpiece can be displayed as a work of art. <br><br>  The TV supports 3D operation and is equipped with an advanced 2D to 3D converter, and also contains all the latest developments of the LG Smart TV platform. <br><br>  The price and terms of deliveries to Russia have not yet been determined, but as soon as they become known, we will notify you.  Stay tuned;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168335/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168335/</a></p>
