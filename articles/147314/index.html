  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hrabrakostyly: Recovery Mode: Q & A: Help publish the question</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Help Me! </h4>  I really miss the opportunity to post a <b>question on the Q &amp; A blog</b> . <br>  Due to a couple of careless actions, my Karma is now the third week below zero. <br>  <b>Recovery Mode</b> does not save. <br><br><h4>  Disclaimer </h4>  I give myself a full report, that the publication of any topic on Habr√©, containing the word "Karma" can greatly reduce this very Karma to the author.  But, I don‚Äôt see a fundamental (tangible) difference between Karma at minus 2 and minus 30 (inclusive). <br>  The only difference is in the potential frequency of comments: <br>  - to comment without limitation "1 comment in 5 minutes" - karma from -1 to -10. <br>  - to comment without limitation ‚Äú1 comment per hour‚Äù - karma from -11 to -30. <br>  In general, Karma merged in the most-un-want-it is such a trifle compared to <b>Read-Only</b> (which I once received for the whole year and a half for just one, not entirely successful question on the Q &amp; A blog), which forced me Get yourself this new "full" profile. <br>  I wrote this topic to solve one small problem in the hope that there would be at least one kind Habrayuzer with positive karma. <br><br><h4>  What do I want to achieve? </h4><blockquote>  It is a mistake to think that a user with negative karma is a bad person. <br>  And if before users with negative karma on the site were quite hard even after realizing the error, now with the appearance </blockquote><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Recovery Mode</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Recovery mode</b> <br>  Users with negative karma (up to -30 inclusive) have a chance to return to the ranks of zahabrennyh - once a week there is an opportunity to write a post or transfer to any profile hub. <br>  Such posts will be marked ‚ÄúRecovery Mode‚Äù - if you're lucky, the community will appreciate the efforts and get the user out of the karmajama. <br>  And, accordingly, to treat them with the same understanding as the posts of "newbies" from the "sandbox". <br></div></div><blockquote>  they have the opportunity to catch up. </blockquote><br>  Using the <b>Reset</b> with karma at -2 would be pretty stupid, and this ‚Äúextreme‚Äù method of resetting Karma (since you can use this option only once during the entire registration process on Habr√©) would not solve the problem, since to publish the question in Q &amp; A need at least +1 in Karma. <br>  Of course, you can try to pee delightful comments and answers in Q &amp; A, but this is unlikely to help you quickly get out of even a very small minus.

      In principle, I would be completely satisfied with the opportunity to publish from under the Recovery Mode no more than the same once a week, but, not only, post-topic, but also a <b>question</b> (and not a topic-question with the possibility of voting, namely simple question on the Q &amp; A blog). <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I think that it would be nice to give such an opportunity to the habrausers since, in my opinion, publishing a full post is a more crucial step than publishing the same Question in Q &amp; A. <br><br>  At least I have killed much more time for writing this <s>shit-</s> topik than if I had just bought myself some three plus signs, and published my question. <br>  Although, there is also one rather serious trick: <br>  If, however, the post is not entirely unsuccessful (judging by the negative feedback), it will still be possible to hide it (remove it in Drafts), then, with a question on the Q &amp; A blog, such dummy ears will not work. <br>  The only possible way to guaranteedly ‚Äúcut out‚Äù the unfortunate question is <s>Harakiri</s> virtual Habr-suicide: change the title of the question and its contents so that the UFO arrives and removes the question itself (at the cost of the subsequent Read-Only Habraban). <br><br><h4>  Wouldn't someone be interested in the question of ... </h4>  Earlier in the Q &amp; A blog, it was often possible to see ‚Äúquestions‚Äù in the style, ‚ÄúWill anyone be interested in an article ...‚Äù, directly hinting that the author of the question wants to pump his own (initially positive, otherwise, He was able to post the question itself) Karma for several units. <br>  And, indeed, it very often worked, despite the abundance of ironic "answers" to this "question".  I didn‚Äôt think that I would ever have to beg for a plus to publish my simple question. <br><br><h4>  Why Habrahabr API </h4>  Long chose a suitable HUB-with-asterisk from the long list. <br>  Forgive me for a clear off-top. <br>  I promise to remove this topical disgrace back into drafts as soon as the problem indicated in the topic is resolved (in any available way), or, as soon as such an opportunity arises, translate it into a more ‚Äúadequate‚Äù hub, for example, ‚ÄúChulan‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  I want to <s>post</s> </h4><blockquote>  Due to negative karma, you can write articles only in ‚ÄúRecovery mode‚Äù <br>  - no more than once a week and only in profile hubs. <br>  Since the last attempt, the week has not yet passed - try 03.07.2012. </blockquote>  Here, wait, finally, publish ... <br><br><h4>  What's wrong? </h4>  Saving an article in draft is equivalent to a full-fledged publication. <br>  In other words, in Recovery mode there is no possibility to quietly (every day) edit (lick) your drafts. <br>  There is a suspicion that, even after the publication itself, there will be no opportunity to make changes to the text of its own topic (until another week passes). <br><br><h4>  Habraparasitism </h4>  ... here I wanted to write about the ways of "black" pushing through my questions. <br><br><h4>  Karmavans </h4>  ... here I wanted to write a little about one of the alternatives to direct begging. <br><br><h4>  Carmacredit </h4>  ... here I wanted to share ideas that it would be nice to give Habrayuzer an opportunity to get a Karma loan, at a certain percentage, with the involvement of guarantors and all that. <br><br><h4>  Karmabalans and karmantropiya </h4>  ... here are some thoughts about the causes of insignificant stable fluctuations of karma around the zero level. <br><br><h4>  Habrakramunity </h4>  ... here I wanted to offer some way without any special effort, by consciously requesting a reduction in one‚Äôs own Karma (for those with more than 15 units) to increase their resistance to the rapid discharge of the latter under the influence of Habratrol‚Äôs sudden activity. <br><br><h4>  How can I help you? </h4>  I ask for real help to those who have Karma more than zero. <br>  Yes, I‚Äôm trying to impudently try with this topic, as I unfortunately have no other choice.  Of course, it would be easier to frankly ask three people to directly add a plus sign to Karma. <br>  You can vote for karma only if the karma of the voter is&gt; 15. <br>  Yes, and not really I want to beg. <br><br><h4>  What to do? </h4>  To really solve my problem, just enough: <br>  To someone, from responsive, understanding Habrayuzer, to create a question with the heading <b>"Help to publish a question"</b> in the Q &amp; A blog. <br>  The body of the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù itself can be left completely empty, or simply put a link to this topic. <br>  Any task with karma +1 and above will cope with this task. <br>  I will do the rest myself by writing a detailed ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù to the question. <br>  For my part, I promise to the one who will help me "crank up" this business, in gratitude for the service rendered, to raise his karma by one (as soon as I myself have the opportunity to do this). <br><br><h4>  So what is next? </h4>  As a ‚Äúresponse‚Äù to this ‚Äúpseudo-question‚Äù, any habrayuzer with absolutely any Karma (including the most negative one) can write a request for the publication of its question, placing the title of the question in the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù itself, and the content of the question - in ‚Äúcomments- to answer. <br>  As long as this question ‚Äúhangs‚Äù, it will be possible to observe the feedback, by pluses and minuses to the request. <br>  After a habraiser agrees to publish this question, he adds a link to the published question in the comment to the request. <br>  The administrator of the topic-question (the author of the question itself) puts the label ‚ÄúDECISION‚Äù to that request, in the comments of which there is a link to the requested question. <br><br><h4>  How it works? </h4>  What will it give in the end? <br>  The ‚ÄúHabrakostyl‚Äù I propose, with proper maintenance, will work quite effectively! <br>  For example, when I ask a question, I can delegate the right to ask this question to another habrauser without problems. <br>  For me personally, it doesn‚Äôt matter at all whether I ask my question myself, or, some other habrauser asks my question. <br>  Therefore, with the advent of this Habrakostil, habrajusors with strongly aminated Karma will have a real opportunity to ‚Äúpush‚Äù their question, and, most importantly, a chance, to get an answer to it! <br><br><h4>  Why so difficult? </h4>  What prevents me right here (for example in the comments to the topic) to publish my requests for the publication of questions? <br>  It is ineffective. <br>  Publication in a specialized Q &amp; A blog of a question (a question that you expect to receive an answer from a more experienced, more knowledgeable habrayuzer, and not a topic-article, where the main goal is set - to draw the reader‚Äôs attention to the object in question) will give a noticeably greater result. <br><br>  Sorry for such a muddled presentation of their thoughts. <br>  In the absence of the ability to save the topic in drafts, for the purpose of subsequent editing, I publish it as-is. <br><br>  I look forward to seeing a Q &amp; A blog post with the title <b>‚ÄúHelp publish a question‚Äù</b> ... <br>  Thanks in advance to those who did not remain indifferent to my little problem! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147314/</a></p>
