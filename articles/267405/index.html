After the release of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/247651/">our first child,</a> we were excited to think that now we‚Äôll start to rivet 100,500 applications a year, we will improve the skills of android developers, and soon world peace will come, and most importantly in the shower. <br>  But nothing lasts forever - the main work took away all our strength and free time, very soon we had a creative crisis.  All our ideas were either too ambitious and demanded decent investments, or they were already wiped to holes.  But the souls were wonderful gusts could not stop, every day we fell asleep and woke up with the thought of a new application. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/505/79b/7fc/50579b7fcb6a4771b971cfdc68be1a3a.jpg"><br>  One fine Friday evening, sipping delicious gulls with lemon, I got on the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%258B_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F">article about the doomsday clock</a> .  Nichosi - I thought and went to sleep.  But the dream was not destined to happen that night.  Barely, cutting my face through the air, I touched the pillow, as a creative explosion occurred in my head.  Stop!  Stop!  Yes, no, nonsense, need to sleep.  Less than a minute, as I sat at the table with another cup of tea.  And so they were born.  I ask under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea was simple to horror.  You just need to gash tracker actions.  So, need a scale?  Scales of scales?  The relationship of good and evil?  Deeds.  Chains of events.  Boomerang good deeds.  For sure.  It's like that.  Two buttons "good" and "bad" deed.  Minimum movements, maximum freedom.

      The night remained sleepless.  And then already on the established scheme.  Phoned with colleagues met.  Designed base, API, sketched layouts.  The countdown has started. <br><br>  In the initial concept, we had only one screen - our minimalism is everything.  Button to create an act, statistics and scales.  On the one hand, good.  On the other - evil. <br><br>  According to the tradition of our mobile group, the designer unsubscribed first.  The next day.  Guys, the first version of the design is ready. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3f/09b/120/e3f09b12056e479fb7874b87a648c57b.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b29/3b0/79f/b293b079f94a41988491081cb03bb097.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td>  This is how the main screen of the application looked when the good won. </td><td>  But when evil triumphed. </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  I will not lie if I say that we were lucky with the designer.  This is truly a great man in every sense. <br><br>  In about two weeks, we collected the first version of the application and raised the first version of the API.  Happy as children :) <br>  Then there was a three-day test.  I agree that 3 days is very little, but even in three days a whole bunch of ideas have appeared.  They collected everything, sorted by importance, merged something and unanimously identified the main ones: <br><br>  1. It became clear that one chekina (as we began to call the act creation event) is clearly not enough.  After all, not only the fact of the creation of the checkin is important to us, but its reason is also very interesting.  A proposal was made to add a comment to the Chekin.  But then we abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a check in one touch.  Now you can check in two touches - the application will miss an empty comment on the server. <br>  2. It is necessary to add some social aspect.  We hypothesized - and let's give users the opportunity to evaluate actions.  Let each user check through his mind and show his attitude.  Add a rating to the comment.  And be sure to add the ability to mark checkin, beyond the scope of the law.  Thus, along with the comment, buttons for likes / dislikes and complaints were added.  The output of the comment rating is obligatory. <br>  3. A widget with the current position of good and evil must be dynamic.  If there were no problems with the arrow, then the static background left an unpleasant sediment.  Made a proposal - discard the current implementation and create a dynamic panorama with two features.  We change the arrow to a static pointer and add a thing to display the current position on the scale of the whole panorama.  Panorama itself now it is the scales.  Right rainbow, light, smile, life.  On the left - lightning, darkness and fire, death, apocalypse.  The relationship of good and evil makes the panorama move either to the left or to the right. <br>  4. The application simply needs the welcome script.  As developers, we are all very clear and understandable, but all the testers unanimously asked the same questions, chief among them - what kind of interesting numbers do you have? <br><br>  No sooner said than done. <br>  And yes, yes, it was the designer who again unsubscribed first - guys, everything is ready.  It was literally two days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa8/b72/592/aa8b72592638438095dec7278f5c46b5.png" width="35%"><br>  Now the main screen looks like this.  Panorama of the world, statistics, the most recent check and create buttons <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99f/ec0/cba/99fec0cba0f74432b09f68d4029ef0fb.png" width="35%"><br>  List of all checkiners by creation time <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a02/a7b/727/a02a7b72767d40dc8c590541e73cf37a.png" width="35%"><br>  Brief help - how to use the application <br><br>  Within a week, they sketched and implemented a simple welcome script. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/717/768/88f/71776888f98e49a1a592d3e99f04b7a5.png" width="35%"><br>  The first page with a comic book, which tells that everything is back.

Thus, the entire application took about three months. <br><br>  That's basically it.  They wrote in their free time for a personal fan.  But to be honest, the pleasures were a whole sea.  The very idea that you are writing an application that can help to tip the scales in the direction of good gives an inexhaustible source of energy.  And even if one of the hundreds of thousands begins to think more about their actions and their consequences, then we have already won. <br><br>  If you have any questions, please ask, I will answer with great pleasure. <br>  We start and pass on the baton of good deeds. <br><br>  All good! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267405/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267405/</a></p>
