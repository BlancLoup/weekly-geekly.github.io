Of course, you can go the hard way and learn to play vinyl to understand what a lag, delay, or "horses" are (often a deliberate mistake of mixing).

      In fact, you can learn everything very quickly if you start with simple tools like Virtual DJ or Traktor.  They will help to master the "information".  You do not need to buy expensive equipment for training right away, and you definitely shouldn't go to DJing schools. <br><br>  For mastering the basics there are many clips on the Internet.  But it is better to tighten the English, video tutorials on the most advanced "chips", as always, are not translated. <br><br>  Now the main method of information - from the computer.  Both vinyl and CDs can be connected to a laptop, you can just play from several computers, connect utilities and tools for live performance to them.  Digital DJing is simple, and this is not the future, but already the present.  Well, best to learn from the music that you like. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>"I will play my own"</b> </blockquote><br>  Even if you need to make a start not from a particular style, but from what kind of music you like in principle, then a beginner DJ can get stuck on one thing.  It is not right.  Playing only deep house or techno, you will not be able to move forward and ‚Äúsell‚Äù yourself.  In this case, the eye becomes blurred very quickly, the sets become monotonous and boring. <br><br>  If you consider DJing as a job, you often have to play not what you like, but something that will require this or that institution.  Until the DJ earns a name for himself. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>"I know all the trends"</b> </blockquote><br>  It is not enough just to know what is in fashion now.  Music needs to be heard and understood.  You will have to constantly update your music base, look for a new one, collect a music library. <br><br>  At first, when a DJ plays at a disco or corporate party, this is doubly important.  The dance floor does not always want what the DJ thinks is ‚Äúright.‚Äù  This will have to be tolerated. <br><br>  For the process of updating the library can be allocated several hours a week.  For example, Sunday morning.  The musical base is an obligatory attribute of a good DJ. <br><br>  Paradox - the better the musical taste, the harder it is to choose tracks.  To choose the music you should use decent headphones.  Ideally, of course, monitors are needed. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think about how I will look - no one looks at me‚Äù</b> </blockquote><br>  With this approach, it is better not to do DJing at all.  You are an artist, not a mannequin.  Therefore, when working at the console, you should not ‚Äústand as a column‚Äù (unless you are not an underground techno DJ or you are not playing minimal house).  You have to be active. <br><br>  If a person is fully involved in the process of work, then the activity at the console happens by itself.  In other words, the DJ is ‚Äúrushing‚Äù on what he does, which means the dance floor will reciprocate.  Massive dances, shouts into the microphone and mad shaking of the head - this does not always look adequate.  The audience does not like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4db/c87/958/4dbc87958b974268859c91833cc00c81.jpg">  <i><font color="#A9A9A9">Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/zigazou76/4120982543/in/photolist-7ha7xa-iDPDm-67ncyG-8fT5SH-dx66ty-d9UmDp-vG17K-cAdmM5-nJFG3Q-TyNBMQ-faGMj7-66X9EX-6fV2Qm-jsGaSu-faGWvS-ouvRb4-hZrGtw-duXseB-bm5ioW-qE6ghg-c6GiSU-rASrd6-TM7Kx5-eZ2aBZ-bkfHGA-9Y5Nji-eaCAMg-bkfHt">Frederic Bisson</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC-BY</a></font></i> <br><br><h2>  <b>Myths for the vocalist</b> </h2><br><blockquote>  <b>‚ÄúI will go to the group or to those who are already known‚Äù</b> </blockquote><br>  If the soul does not lie in office work, and the eye begins to twitch at the slightest mention of an unloved activity, this does not mean that ‚Äúexit‚Äù is already a ‚Äúready‚Äù musical project or team. <br><br>  Finding ‚Äúyour own‚Äù group is priceless, but you need to understand that a similar situation can occur in the creative field.  Therefore, if you sing well, but do not like chanson, do not agree to sing in a restaurant or in a group that imitates Butyrka. <br><br>  If you want to "shout" into the microphone in the style of Kurt Cobain, then even for a good fee you should not go to the pop group.  There will be conflicts, tensions and disputes.  All this takes your time. <br><br>  On the other hand, it is important to be able to find compromise solutions.  A group of like-minded people has a better chance of success.  But as soon as the group goes into the background and becomes a hobby, it will not have commercial success.  Although this does not mean that such an outcome is bad.  Amateur groups do not go on tour, but perform well on corporate events and earn. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>‚ÄúMy repertoire is perfect‚Äù</b> </blockquote><br>  It is important to know your target audience.  If you are a cover band, and the goal is to ‚Äúdance‚Äù a motley audience, you need to ‚Äúwork‚Äù with the appropriate repertoire. <br><br>  This advice is rather trivial, but not every musical group remembers it.  There are situations when the group performs at Dorn's corporate party and does not understand why the dance floor remains so empty and the faces so serious. <br><br>  On the stage, you need to be open and honest to the public - then she will answer the same.  Whoever is on the dance floor, it is necessary to play and sing from the heart and for the people. <br><br>  The viewer is the same person as you.  He may be tired.  The spectator must be felt during the concert.  "Shake" the audience should be very carefully.  If people are tired, and the group persistently plays cheerful songs, you can finally ‚Äúbreak‚Äù the atmosphere. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>A common myth: "I earn an apartment"</b> </blockquote><br>  At the beginning of the money will not be.  To start playing, the best way is to find a place that could benefit from music or your vocal talent.  In this case, you must be prepared to play and sing for a minimal fee or for free. <br><br>  The way, of course, difficult.  There are a lot of people on the market now who are ready to speak "for experience" or for minimal money.  But if you like the institution and you will be hired on a permanent or contract basis - this will be a good start. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>PS:</b> we will help to collect a minimum set of equipment and begin rehearsals - on the topic of " <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/muzykalnye_intrumenty/">musical instruments</a> " we have more than 40 thematic categories of goods. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <b>PPS:</b> construction tape perfectly sticks wires to clothes. <br><br>  And never jump into the crowd at the first concert - break your nose. <br><br>  If you have become a good professional, then working in the music industry is fun.  Clubs, music, fans.  But it is not exactly. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373671/</a></p>
