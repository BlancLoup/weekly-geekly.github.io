      <nobr>Want to know more about features and expansion options?</nobr> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Description of features and capabilities:</b> <br><br>  <b>Bittorrent accelerator</b> is the full bittorrent protocol support for any video you are watching on You Tube website.  All videos on YouTube you can now watch through torrents and receive a video stream not only from one of the remote YouTube servers, but from all users who have watched this video or are watching it through this extension.  This will provide you with a more stable and reliable stream!  The principle of operation is one - the more users will use this solution, the more efficiently it will work and everyone will have a stable stream at the maximum speed for its Internet channel! <br><br>  <b>The libvlc-based web player</b> (an excellent alternative to Flash!) - now you can watch YouTube videos through the world's most functional web player.  / imho Learn more: <a href="http://torrentstream.info/">How to control the player</a> . <br><br>  <b>The ability to download videos in any format</b> - you can download videos for a direct link, in any quality and in any format used by YouTube. To select the format - button ‚ÄúSAVE‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Turning on / off autoplay</b> - if you feel uncomfortable when you open a page on YouTube, it starts playing video automatically, you will have the option to turn off autoplay and turn it on when you need it.  Attention!  When you start a playlist, autoplay of all the clips it contains will occur regardless of whether this option is turned on or off. <br><br>  <b>Important!</b>  To use this extension, you must have a Torrent Stream P2P Multimedia Plug-in plugin installed.  (This plugin is included in the <a href="http://torrentstream.info/">Torrent Stream 1.0.5 Full</a> installation software package, which can be downloaded for free from the <a href="http://torrentstream.org/">Torrent Stream</a> website. <br><br>  <b>Add.</b>  <b>Information:</b> To use the advanced settings of the web player, you must have the TS Player desktop player (a modified and improved version of VLC) installed through which all settings are made and which is also included in the <a href="http://torrentstream.info/">Torrent Stream Full 1.0.5</a> installation package assembly. This dependency is related so that the settings of the desktop version of the player are synchronized with the web player and therefore are made via TS Player (for example: if you want to enable hardware acceleration / video accelerator in the web player, you will need to  this setting it in the desktop player) <br><br>  <b>Links to the office.</b>  <b>Market pages for installing an extension:</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mndoohjdoechinpkfbkolflbonciahfo">For Google Chrome</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/p2p-youtube/">For Mozilla Firefox</a> (available for installation, but in queue for verification) <br><br>  <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/p2p-youtube/">For Opera</a> <br><br>  Test versions and source codes of releases can always be found on the TS support forum, here: <a href="http://forum.torrentstream.org/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1309.0">P2P YouTube</a> (there is an extension for Operrera) <br><br>  <b>And now, some technical details about how streaming via torrents on YouTube works:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  After the first viewing of the video by any of the users, a torrent file is created that is attached to the url of the video page </li><li>  When this video is launched by another user, the playback will already go directly through the torrent file, which also additionally includes http-sid with the server support address going directly from YouTube (all this happens on the fly and in the background). </li><li>  Support for the stream from other peers occurs both during the video playback by them and after it, while the user stores this data in the cache.  This is a very significant advantage over the RTMFP protocol, which is still more suitable for live broadcasts, allowing you to support the stream from other users only at the time of viewing, limited to the amount of data of a certain time range. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>If users are interested !:</b> Actually, similar support can be included for any other video hosting sites and even file storages.  For example, if one user downloaded a video or audio file from the file hosting service using the Torrent Stream software, another user, having entered the page from which the file was downloaded, will be able to immediately start playing it through the torrent without having to download it.  But the ability to download, and already through the torrent, of course it will also make sense to leave.  But it is so, thoughts are heard. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> With the release of the P2P YouTube extension, we first of all wanted to show that torrents and the bittorrent protocol can now be used to create high-quality VoD services, not yielding to the prebuffering speed (waiting time before starting to play) and the response time when rewinding other solutions common to all. adding its huge advantages (minimizing the costs of content providers for video delivery; an additional possibility to localize incoming foreign traffic for network providers; stable video stream d  I end-user at the maximum for its Internet link speed).  We hope this will allow to raise the reputation of the torrents and the bittorrent protocol, so that many will no longer believe that this wonderful technology is used only as a means for illegal file sharing.  And this is the most important! <br><br>  <b>And a little bit of PR for <a href="http://torrentstream.org/">Torrent Stream</a></b> <br>  Today, the Torrent Stream solution is the only one in the world that allows for such a prebuffering speed and a fast rewind response rate when playing online video through torrents, which actually allows using this technology to organize professional high-quality VoD services. <br><br>  If someone else knows at least one solution in the world that is not inferior or perhaps surpasses the Torrent Stream in this, I would really appreciate the information.
