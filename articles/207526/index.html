  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hard Trucker - unfulfilled dream</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, dear residents of Habr.  Some time ago I published a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169085/">post</a> about how we created a remake of such a wonderful game as Truckers-2.  Hard Trucker Those who are interested, please under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Immediately about the bad </h4><br>  Unfortunately, none of this very good idea we have failed.  As is known, everything began with enthusiasm.  Practically there were no financial investments, each our like-minded person gave his free time and soul to the project, but alas. <br><br><h4>  How it was </h4><br>  Immediately after the publication of the article on Habr√©, the number of our associates grew to an incredible number: 700 people in a couple of hours.  Among them were truly cool programmers, modelers, designers.  Practically everyone was ready to devote 8 hours a week to develop.  Problems appeared from the very first minutes ... <br><br><h4>  Problem one: Concept: </h4><br>  For me, it still remains a mystery why the CEO decided to immediately make the game only single-player.  This, IMHO, is extremely stupid.  How many potential players we would lose.  The overwhelming majority of the community associated with the development was precisely for the principle of MMO with the possibility of creating a development of their own company, competition and all the charms of the genre.  But alas ... From this idea were immediately.

    <h4>  Problem Two: Technical </h4><br>  Again, the CEO intervened, he did not heed the rational arguments for using Unreal.  Instead, he demanded implementation on Unity.  Perhaps in some cases, the choice is good, but the most ordinary human greed has intervened.  Yes Yes.  It is greed, but more on that later.  By the way, most of the programmers were exactly Unreal specialists. <br><br><h4>  Problem Three: Self-love </h4><br>  Another human factor and, as you might have guessed, by the CEO.  There were people who were ready to help with the creation of the site and even the provision of hosting for free.  But our competent manager decided that we would create the site ourselves and help, I‚Äôm not afraid of the word, we don‚Äôt need great specialists. <br><br><h4>  Problem last: Greed </h4><br>  As I mentioned above, the project was based only on enthusiasm, but as soon as the first results of our work appeared, the management immediately wanted a lot of money.  That is why they abandoned Unreal in favor of Unity.  The explanation is very simple: we will immediately do for all possible platforms.  Everyone did not care that the programmers, and there were only five of us, had already understood the essence of the work and had a huge number of developments.  Moreover, the work was done so much that it was possible to assemble a pre-alpha version.  And yes, as I promised, the demo video was ready. <br><br><h4>  <s>Obituary</s> epilogue </h4><br>  It is quite natural that the project is bent.  But it was closed not from unwillingness to continue working, but from the fact that the CEO, who is not well versed in development matters, gave out another batch ... I don‚Äôt even know what to call it.  His ideas were as follows: <br><ul><li>  Freeze the project and start developing your own (!!!!) graphics and physics engine!  Remember the number of programmers </li><li>  Completely refuse to collect donations on sites like Kickstarter </li><li>  Remove most of the developers and designers from the project and hire professionals instead.  Let me remind you that there are no financial assets and no </li><li>  The most ingenious change: Start developing the next clone of the wonderful game STALKER.  Comments are superfluous. </li></ul><br><br>  With a group of like-minded people, I wanted to continue developing Hard Trucker.  we asked to give us all the work, all the arts.  But we did not get it.  We got a full ignore and ban in the official group in contact.  That's all. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion and conclusions </h4><br>  First of all, I would like to apologize to all those who pin hopes on us, who gave us all possible help.  Thanks guys! <br>  I would also like to give some advice to such enthusiasts like us.  Perhaps they seem obvious to many, but still. <br><ul><li>  Be sure to chat with the project management.  Find out if they have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat to do. </li><li>  Even if the project is non-commercial, get ready for financial investments </li><li>  Never refuse help </li><li>  And most importantly: Do not give up your idea, your dream.  Always go to the end, even if he will not be victorious </li></ul><br><br>  Thanks to everyone who worked with me, you are cool guys.  I know you read this post. <br><br>  PS I sincerely ask for the found spelling and punctuation errors to report in a personal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207526/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207526/</a></p>
