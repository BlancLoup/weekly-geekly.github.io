  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History, terminology, markets</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/080926/W5o2reUZ1o.gif"><br><h1>  Story </h1><br>  The term <b>netbook</b> was originally introduced by Psion in 1999 as a generic term for small form factor portable computers with minimal power consumption for work, office and web surfing. <a name="habracut"></a>  The first Psion Netbooks were the smallest in their line of laptops, and came with a special, trimmed version of the Psions Epoc Operation System.  After a while it was replaced by WinCE.  But the volume of deliveries, along with the wrong marketing and usability problems of the OS, brought the company only losses.  Also, the profitability of the whole business was influenced by a narrow target audience at that time, and high production costs.  The netbook idea ended in failure. <br><br><h1>  Term </h1><br>  In February 2008, the term netbook was again proposed to the public by Intel, as the name for the category of small, low-cost, lightweight and weakly functional subnotebooks optimized for Internet access. <br>  Their main functions, according to Paul Otellini (chief executive officer of Intel), are data processing (processing) directly on a netbook, or by means of ‚Äúremote data processing‚Äù (on powerful computing servers). <br>  Most netbooks come on sale with <i>open</i> OS based on Linux.  This is done for the sake of low price, because  Commercial OSs like from the same Windows cost at least $ 100.  But with the advent of the new Atom processor line from Intel, the situation has noticeably changed for the better - because  Atom prices were significantly lower than Celeron <i>s</i> , and component suppliers reduced prices as orders grew.  Manufacturers of netbooks began to equip them with expensive operating systems like Windows XP Home / Pro, Windows Vista Home / Business, etc.  And it literally blew up the buyer.  In some regions (India, China, CIS) resellers began to sell netbooks as a replacement for full-fledged laptops, taking advantage of illiteracy and ignorance of the buyer. <br><br><h1>  Market </h1><br>  Intel marketers have clearly worked out the approach, behavior and fall of Psion in the niche they created.  After reworking the concept and prospects for the market, making the knight's move in retaliation for AMD and their Geode, in order to increase its market share.  According to company forecasts, the volume of the netbook market by 2011 will grow to 50 ml.  pieces  But this is not the limit - Intel is very much looking forward to a new market: ‚Äú <i>We are planning to increase the computing power to 1 billion units!</i>  (meaning the market number of PCs) <i>- We would never do this with the classic layout, and with classic desktop PCs!</i>  "- said Paul Ottelini at a press conference in honor of the release of a new line of CPU Atom. <br>  Observing the growth in the netbook market share, experts argue that this is only the dawn of <i>netbook globalization</i> because  with the arrival of AMD and VIA processors in the niche (and this will certainly happen after the intervention of the international anti-monopoly committee, which Intel has been in trouble for so long), there will be another drop in processor prices.  In addition to everything, global component manufacturers are reorganizing their production facilities to produce components for netbooks.  This will also positively affect the final price of netbooks. <br>  Considering the recent changes in the PC and Internet technology markets of the world, the most advantageous sales place for netbooks in the next 3-5 years will be the CIS countries (Russia, Ukraine, etc.), China, India, and third world countries.  Other already organized markets such as America and Japan are also important for manufacturers, but the pursuit of maximum profits will lead them to us in the CIS.
