So ... So. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Well, pride is overwhelming - I can't do anything with myself, I want to brag.  Reflecting on the processor architecture of his dreams, he invented the same thing as the IBM engineers in POWER6.  Only from a logical point of view, of course, where am I there to their self-organizing bubbles around conductors.  Trifle, but nice.  Hyh ... But on the other hand - not very nice, because ... And who cares?  Even if I register all this architecture on Verilog, even if it suddenly turns out to be effective in such an amateur performance, then who will need this work?  No, of course, she will be needed.  Anyone like Intel or IBM, or some other microelectronics manufacturer, will find useful or useless solutions for it, but solutions that they have not yet patented and will gladly buy everything with all the stuffing, so that even a hint of competition and something new there was no side.  They bought Babayan's crazy project and did not choke. <br><br>  And ours?  Doesn‚Äôt our national economy need processors?  Needed, how else.  In vain, perhaps, Intel almost wants to launch production here, so that customs fees are not paid.  But our government has a very original policy regarding Russian inventions.

      Recently, this ... our main power engineer boasted how they bought the new gas-fired power plant from General Electric, and this is despite the fact that our gas turbines are much more efficient because they make them based on engine technology for fighter aircraft. <br><br>  Then, what domestic processor and supercomputer projects receive funding from our federal authorities?  That's right, MCST-R4 (no, of course, the guys from MCST are cool immensely, they make great processors, they teach students, they are our pride) - a processor manufactured under a SPARC license, or, for example, a SKIF supercomputer (not unknown) , the only domestic part of which is the ventilation system and the body is a great high-tech, made together with the Belarusians. <br><br>  And all this despite the fact that domestic engineers have everything to make a computer much cheaper, simpler and more productive, except for the production line.  But there are lines in Taiwan, where they grow crystals of any shape and size, for not so much money.  Only with such computers, none of the Western friends will break anything. <br><br>  And what about the high-speed train ordered in Germany (most of all I was killed by Ivanov‚Äôs satisfied mug, which said that the contract was not easy, but the contract was golden, for 20 years of maintenance)?  And this advertised ... Superjet-100 is a domestic aircraft, in which only the name and body are from domestic: American avionics, French engines. <br><br>  Or all this jazz with nanotechnology?  Have you seen pure nanotechnology anywhere?  Well, except for exaggerated departments in the national universities?  It is always physics, biology or chemistry on microscales.  At the same time, physicists are usually the most, especially quantum and especially electronics.  What are our bosses doing?  From physicists, chemists and biologists money is taken away and vbuhivayu in some kind of nonsense, called materials science.  What the fuck's so fucking crazy? <br><br>  So think after that, for whom our government works in full force.  Yes, by the way, a couple more amusing facts to complete the picture. <br><br>  1. There is such a crap - PRND - this is sort of like the personal rating of a scientist, recently invented by the Ministry of Education and Science.  There are all sorts of points and other skukatischa, but most of all give points, guess for what?  That's right, for publishing in English in foreign, especially American, magazines.  At the same time, the more paper the scientist used up (not the more he invented the useful and the great, because, sometimes, the useful and the great fit on 10 pages of one article), the more money they pay.  You can publish any crap and no one will notice, if only to get into magazines.  And the magazines are different, especially American.  There you can and with creationism speak.  Details: <a href="http://www.epchtein.ru/prnd.htm">www.epchtein.ru/prnd.htm</a> <br><br>  2. There is another crap - experience sharing trips.  Guess which one is easier to knock out, and in the course of which one give a greater monetary allowance beyond the paid stay at a party?  Right in America.  It would seem that for such a crap?  But here is such a crap, but there is not enough money in the country. <br><br>  If this is not a conspiracy to turn the country into a raw materials appendage, even with huge hydrocarbon reserves, then what?  We can at least zazvedovatsya and zadobyvatsya, if we have nothing but oil will not, then ... BrrrRr.  What can we dictate if it is the only source of existence? <br><br>  Eh ... Here ... But you need to try to at least design the processor anyway.  Let it be on paper, and that is good.  And put it in open access. <br><br>  ps (kneeling) please do not vote for a unified Russia, Putin and all this Labudovaya false top.  let it be different, not so glossy and beautiful, harsh and stupid, but honestly working for their country. <br><br>  (rising from his knees) Otherwise, you really force us to make education paid.  Really paid - that way in the amount of semi-annual normal salary (thousand 180) for the semi-annual course of one subject for a group of 30 people.  Or you can generally be left without honest and high-quality higher education, because scientists also want to live normally.  And I don‚Äôt take money from much more (okay, I‚Äôm a programmer and I can earn some money, although this reduces the degree of my scientific potential. But what should a biologist, a chemist, physics, mathematics do?).  The current government will not give, and the private entrepreneur will not receive anything from investments in high-level, except for a headache. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12867/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12867/</a></p>
