SexyCyborg is a girl from China who likes to develop unusual electronic devices.  She is also interested in the field of information security.  On Geektimes already wrote about the development of the young talent: <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/260824/">shoes with a cache</a> , printed on a 3D printer and " <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/252988/">Shining Skirt</a> " with a ribbon of LEDs. <br><br>  The Chinese woman has also created a wrist station for miniature drones, which allows you to carry these devices anywhere and everywhere without fear of damaging them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71e/47b/d20/71e47bd20ca1c6f7d76e3c138b0d14b6.jpg" width="650">

      <a href="http://imgur.com/a/IDoTG">The drones docking station</a> is mounted on the wrist, and accommodates two small devices (Nano Drone).  The controller for controlling the drones is mounted on the belt buckle, so that the whole system for launching the devices is always with you.  The docking station is printed on the printer, as is the buckle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/176/89c/cec/17689ccec1bf25454826ecaa05bb0531.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  She decided to take up this project after visiting the drone races in Shenzhen.  ‚ÄúDue to the low cost of vehicles, anyone can afford to take part in races, create and launch their own drone.  This is something like modern racing for geeks.  I am not ready to compete now, but I can train here, ‚Äùthe girl says.  "I do not want people to think that I am only an observer, but I also do not want to carry a large aircraft with me." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1aa/aab/a36/1aaaaba36c7a5654a8fd42ec1708c858.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  For this reason - the reluctance to carry with them a quadrocopter, the girl created a wrist docking station for two drones, model Cheerson CX-10D.  SexyCyborg says that it understands the impossibility of constantly carrying an ‚Äúairfield‚Äù with it, but in most cases this invention turns out to be useful.  "I carry two drons, because the battery life is rather short, and the batteries are quickly discharged," comments SexyCyborg.  She also explains that the capabilities of the Cheerson CX-10D are not too great, but they are fairly stable and easy to manage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a8/482/abd/5a8482abd3aa929219b7dda116de6132.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  She created the docking station in Tinkercad.  According to her, this is the best software for creating 3D models.  She tried other software platforms, but always returned to Tinkercad.  The models she created can be found on the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1587484">Thingiverse</a> , the developer has laid out several options for a docking station for hands of different sizes.  Drones are held in place with small magnets.  The walls of the "airfield" protect fragile drones from damage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f27/13a/e31/f2713ae3188b13b694fe59ea196430e0.jpg" width="650"><br><br><h3>  Infinity skirt </h3><br>  The other day, SexyCyborg has <a href="http://imgur.com/a/N8MZd">posted a post</a> about another of its inventions, which she called "Skirt-infinity."  This is the second hi-tech skirt from her after "Shining Skirt". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/596/035/988/5960359884215812c61f29bf596c73cc.jpg" width="650"><br>  <i>Shining skirt</i> <br><br>  As a basis for a new project, she took small LED elements, called the ‚Äúinfinite mirror‚Äù, connected them to the system and fixed it all on a flexible substrate.  According to her, you can do anything from ‚Äúinfinite mirrors‚Äù, including belts, bags, skirts, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/028/ebf/519/028ebf51963c5059ca05fbd24183a5ac.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  The elements are fastened together using electromagnets located at the edges of each "mirror".  What is made now is only the first prototype, in the future the skirt will be more functional.  In particular, it is planned to place a capacious battery and Arduino. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/27d/aa3/c3c/27daa3c3cad516a707336685f2606e5f.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  Now the place for the battery was also found, but the case for it turned out to be very large. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/207/2a8/3c8/2072a83c8ba94161680a16ddd5844ed9.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  The battery was decided to use an external, with a USB port.  This is convenient because such systems are universal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c92/f79/c34/c92f79c3483061db59162f345ab3f498.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  Well, now you can turn on the system and admire the work done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1de/d90/883/1ded90883ea7a35826996d9347c022f9.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  In order not to get confused, the designation was decided to be applied manually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6cd/8e9/c30/6cd8e9c30800de9e95c5780d895a1a2e.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  And this is the frame for the ‚Äúmirror‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/052/9b8/a09/0529b8a099bfdca8f966c62c48cd1689.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  Here is the final result of the work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a7/96b/ece/0a796becea7cfdde8c8fa0443a0a580b.jpg" alt="image" width="650"><br><br>  She also posted a video demonstrating the process of creating her skirt. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zo3SG2iNSXg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg6q7wiUrQEgBZ8ncvSGok9Z7IClA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  SexyCyborg is aware that its designs are becoming popular, not least because of its unusual appearance.  She herself believes that there is nothing wrong with that.  It works a lot, and not all of its projects puts on the network.  A number of projects that remain nameless are being developed for neighbors' children.  3D printing still remains something unusual for ordinary people, which is why SexyCyborg surprises its neighbors by constantly creating things that are interesting to them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396571/</a></p>
