Chose "SEO and SMO". <br><br>  The bottom line is simple.  Everyone knows that Yandex has announced the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/74175/">closure of</a> its top blog entries, while providing everyone with an API to create their own ratings. <br>  After that, a <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/tools/blogs/">clone of</a> Top Yandex immediately appeared on the website of Lebedev Studio, seemingly done so far without using the API, as well as <a href="http://whoyougle.com/blogs/">whoyougle.com/blogs</a> using the latter. <br><br>  Looking at this situation, I thought, why not make your top blogs <s>with go and geishas</s> , because it is always interesting to do something new.  Perhaps, I overestimate my strength, because I am neither Yandex, Temoy, or Spout <s>, maximum nickname of the latter</s> .  But, nevertheless, it is interesting to try, and even if it does not work out, valuable experience will appear.

      So, how do I present a rating based on the Yandex API, so that it could be <b>at least some kind of</b> replacement for the original: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. He should have a good, remembered name, which is neither <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/tools/blogs/">www.artlebedev.ru/tools/blogs</a> , nor <a href="http://www.whoyougle.com/blogs/">www.whoyougle.com/blogs</a> <br>  In this regard, 2 domains are registered, <a href="http://topblogov.ru/">TopBlogov.ru</a> and <a href="http://blograting.org/">BlogRating.org</a> .  Which one to choose for the service will be decided soon. <br><br>  2. There must be confidence in the rating.  The credibility of the rating will be only if the ranking formula is well known and anyone can verify that the rating corresponds to it. <br><br>  3. The ranking formula should protect as much as possible against cheating and give the most relevant result possible.  How this is combined with its openness is not very clear. <br><br>  4. Ratings by separate parameters (number of links, attendance, number of comments) are not needed.  We need one, but good. <br><br>  Of course, whatever the service ‚Äúfired‚Äù is, this is not enough, a sane design is needed, advertising is needed, and that Lebedev would go on another ethnographic expedition, the planets stood in a row, and I would have taken this fan project so seriously.  But it's not about that.  Speech on the calculation formula.  It is possible that with this discussion we will simply help to improve the Rating of the Subject or Spout, which is also good.  Well, if the project is launched and interesting, at least a normal server on the collocation is loaded for about 20%, we will have time to buy a second one. <br><br>  The main 2 questions are what calculation algorithm to choose and whether it is worth making the formula publicly available. <br>  Let me remind you that the Yandex API provides: <br><ul><li>  <b>links24</b> - the number of links to the record, </li><li>  <b>links,</b> is the total number of links to the record for all its existence, </li><li>  <b>links24weight</b> - weighted number of links to the record (with filtered wraps and spam links), </li><li>  <b>comments24</b> - the number of comments to the post, </li><li>  <b>comments</b> - the total number of comments to the record for all its existence, </li><li>  <b>commenters24</b> - the number of different Russian-speaking commentators in the record, </li><li>  <b>commenters</b> - the number of different Russian-language commentators in the record for the entire time of its existence, </li><li>  <b>visits24</b> - approximate number of visitors. </li></ul><br>  What is worth considering and what is not?  The first thought is to take everything and multiply, thus obtaining a certain common coefficient.  Then comes the understanding that "the total number of links to the record for all the time of its existence," as well as "the total number of comments to the record for all the time of its existence" should not have a positive weight, as we will increase the number of old Boyans in the top. <br><br>  It is also not clear why the links24 parameter is needed if there are links24weight.  You can only use it.  Or, you can subtract links24weight from links24 and use this as a reduction factor for stranded entries.  At the moment, this seems like a sensible idea. <br><br>  Another interesting parameter is the number of comments and commentators.  It is clear that the number of commentators is more important (because you can write any number of comments from 1 account), but it is still unclear what ratio of the number of comments to the number of commentators is the most correct (hello to shingles). <br><br>  I also consider it correct to introduce a reduction factor, if any of the 3 positive parameters sags, that is, it is very small.  For example, in the freshly weathered top whoyougle.com now hangs a post with 2 comments that suggests.  At the same time, in order to introduce such a coefficient, it is required to calculate a certain average value of each parameter, which will be taken as a standard.  I think that it is technically not difficult (to calculate such a value in a month, for example, for each parameter). <br><br>  As a result, we get 3 main parameters that should be used: <br><br>  Positive: <ul><li>  <b>links24weight</b> </li><li>  commenters24 and comments24 for some formula, let's say for a start ( <b>SQR (commenters24 * comments24))</b> </li><li>  <b>visits24</b> </li></ul><br>  Negative: <ul><li>  <b>links24 - links24weight</b> </li><li>  <b>any of the positively-influencing coefficients are less than average by more than X%</b> </li></ul><br><br>  These are the confused thoughts.  At this point they end and I want to hear public opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74342/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74342/</a></p>
