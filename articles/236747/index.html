  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thoughts on the virtual-real game (survey)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I was increasingly visited by the thought of creating a virtual-real game (maybe there is another term for this).  Let me explain what I mean. <br>  Imagine a real playing field, say 5 x 10 meters.  At the two ends of this field there are ‚Äúbases‚Äù surrounded by a number of quite real robots (from lego, meikblok, or other material). <br>  Management of all this disgrace is available remotely - players can connect via a browser or client.  Like any strategy, two players can control each robot unit.  The goal as in any strategy is to smash the enemy army, destroy the base. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Robots </h5><br>  Robots can be different and perform different functions.  For example, the invisible robot (technically, you can paint the case with a color that will be ignored by the server and replaced with the background of the environment - chroma key technology). <br>  Robots on different platforms: <br><ul><li>  wheel </li><li>  tracked </li><li>  walking </li><li>  flying (quadro / hexo copter, airship).  Obviously, the most difficult thing about flying is judging by the competition of flying robots, which was conducted by Kroc (to be honest, I was waiting for the team to perform with the airship, but unfortunately they were not at the competition) </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Robot upgrade </h5><br>  Before the game, it is possible to install certain modules that give advantages over other robots, for example, high-speed engines, tracked platform, more powerful range finders (sonars, IR-bumpers, lidars).  Naturally, it is not necessary to physically form the robot - restrictions can be programmed. <br><br><h5>  Playing field </h5><br>  The playing field can also be covered in green / blue and apply chroma key.  And it is possible to be confused, to make as on dioramas - grass, trees, streams.

    <h5>  Special effects </h5><br>  Ideally, for full entourage, you can make flying off parts when hit by a shot, pyrotechnics, smoke, sparks.  Or you can add effects to 3D technology on the fly. <br><br><h5>  Game screen </h5><br>  Above the playground are cameras for tracking the game, and each robot also has its own camera.  Therefore, in addition to any HUD, the player can watch from above the group of robots, or on behalf of the robot itself. <br><br><h5>  Varieties of games </h5><br>  Best of all, you can implement such a project in parts - from simple to complex: <br><ul><li>  Simple racing.  I met on the Internet such a toy, where there was an opportunity to control a toy machine.  Everything is obvious here - there is a certain track, several machines.  Implementation is simple </li><li>  Shooter.  Each player is given to manage one robot, which can somehow cause damage to the enemy.  Script options can be borrowed from other games (desmatch, capture the flag, etc.) </li><li>  Strategy.  The player is given the opportunity to control a group of robots, or a separate robot (like the planetary battles of the Space Rangers) </li></ul><br><br>  I describe all this not by chance.  I want to understand how interesting it would be for you to play a similar game, under the following conditions: <br><ol><li>  The game is paid (hourly, or for one game) </li><li>  RTS / Shooter Game </li><li>  At your disposal are robots that can be smashed within reasonable limits. </li></ol><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who voted and commented. <br>  I want to make a few reservations. <br>  1. I do not pretend either to the novelty of the idea or to the idea itself.  All that I have invented and described has long been invented by someone.  However, I will call her as my own. <br>  2. I do not position my idea as a way to make money easily.  No one says that implementing all of the above is easy.  How many difficulties will come, as much and leave.  Graphics (3D-world) - disappears.  Physics (gravity, etc.) - disappears.  Synchronization (I do not know the scientific term, when you shot, and the object left out of sight for a long time) - disappears.  But I know that I will have to face other problems.  Yes, you have to accompany, to repair something every time, but you still need to prove that this is a real problem. <br>  3. Yes, project implementation can be costly.  A cheap implementation of an idea can only be something like <a href="http://www.kp.ru/online/news/1823806/">‚Äúsmart‚Äù containers</a> :). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236747/</a></p>
