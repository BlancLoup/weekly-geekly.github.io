    <h2>  Preface. </h2><br>  Perhaps I'll start.  It all started with the distant year 2006.  Why so far?  Because it was then that I started thinking about feedback.  I quit my job and, as usual, decided to create something of <strong>my own</strong> .  And opened an online store.  That fed me ... but not much.  I have often wondered what the rake was. <br><br>  There was a profit.  Each month, the profit was about equal.  There was no increase.  Then it was generally bad, there were no sales.  At all!  Despite the fact that AdWords ate money, the office (I did not understand why it was for me, but it was) also ate money.  And there was no sales.  It got to the point that I came to work on the last money.  And I thought: how to sell? !!!  I had a pair of phones, customers recently bought equipment.  and I decided that by all means I wouldn‚Äôt be able to "push" something to them!  Somehow it didn‚Äôt grow together, let it go, it turned out the sale of 2 MacBooks + Air Port and something else, I don‚Äôt remember to be honest. <br><br>  Question: <br>  Why did not it work out? <br>  Answer: <br>  Because I started my communication with the client somehow timidly, I stupidly failed to lie (globally).  I just told the customer about the existing promotion in my and-store.  Although the action was fictional, it did not matter.  The trick was that I lied about the fact that every client is dear to me, and that I carefully keep records of my clients. <br><br>  then it helped me out for a week, financially, and I forgot about it.  Gone, forgotten. <br><br>  It is also worth mentioning one of the methods for obtaining a contact of the customer in the store.  I just gave the phone to the girl, the assistant, and she said this: <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe fact is that ALL our managers are busy, please leave your phone number and we will call you back within 2-3 minutes‚Äù!  The call arrived to the client in one minute.  I used this technique constantly in the future !!!  But it was modified depending on the circumstances! <br><br>  Then my life changed.  I left the province, Zaporozhye, in the big city - Kiev.  And he worked again in the online store selling Apple.  And then it began.  I work in an online store in Kiev.  there are other volumes and other customers.  VIP clients ... feedback with them could bring a lot of money, and brought. <br><br>  And so if you carefully read the above written, then you can see that I have already revealed 1 point of feedback.  it is very important to make it clear to the client that he is important.  Once he is remembered, they call, etc.  it means that it‚Äôs important, a normal client understands that all this is for sale ... but he appreciates it on a subconscious level. <br><br>  And so we went on.  In Kiev, in the store where I worked, the chef once publicly praised me for working with contacts.  In fact, it was very difficult to do something in a company with its own rules, namely to use a Mac and that's it.  The entire customer base was in AdressBook, and for me as a manager it was not enough.  I always kept working contacts and cataloged them in my own way.  But even in zzhatyh conditions not a single bell left me.  I had a habit that was later transferred to the chief and other employees, came to work, and phoned all the missed numbers from work phones.  Dialogue with a potential client is also important, but this is another story. <br><br>  And so the 2nd point is the ability to catalog contacts.  In fact, it does not matter how to do it, the main thing is that you, as a sales manager, have control over your own customer base.  And the 3rd point is 100% return.  if there are missed calls, or a new mail, answer!  Mail for the e-store is as important as the phone.  Answer right away if the phone number is listed there, call. <br><br><h2>  Act! </h2><br>  Kiev is left behind and I open a new online store, roughly speaking, I hired as a head-manager, curator of the i-store development.  I got quite a bit of experience in Kiev, communicating with VIP clients.  And this experience played a role in the future.  In Kiev, I wanted to realize one thing.  But somehow did not grow together.  Namely: <br><br>  Not just customer accounting, but ‚Äúfriendly - hello how are you‚Äù.  How it started  In the new project I acted as a curator, and directly as a senior seller.  Because it was necessary to teach sellers (managers) to do business as I did.  I confess then considered myself a guru.  But it is not so important who I considered myself :) the main thing is that this thought gave me a moral impetus to creation. <br><br>  And so, the client comes&gt; communicate&gt; sale&gt; ‚ÄúIf you do not mind, leave your contacts, because very often we have stocks, etc.  And most importantly, new items always diverge among customers!  And now you are our client, and so to speak, we will help you with what we can ‚Äù- I made it clear to the client that if something out of the ordinary appears on the market, and then it was the MacBook Air era, then YOU client will be offered first!  Also, clients could get me (me, myself, you ... you can safely replace responsive TP) by phone and torment with questions.  Plus communication with the client.  In Kiev, and then in the next project there was one important trifle - Coffee!  awesome expensive coffee that was offered to the client who came to the office.  If clients do not go to your office, you have a bad office.  And not necessarily that the office was a super-duper.  When UA-VIPs came to Kiev for a poppy seed in a 2 by 5 meter room, I don‚Äôt think that it was in a cool office. <br><br>  And so after the sale, I informed the client about how we treat them carefully and received contacts, the important point: ‚ÄúTell me at what time and on what days is it convenient to contact you by phone?‚Äù And then the emphasis was placed on the phone call, under pre-payment the fact that live communication is always better and more productive!  People willingly left their numbers and wrote down my name calling something like this - Michael% shopname%.  And I, in turn, made a corresponding entry in my contact mega-accountant, that this person should call on Saturdays and at xx-xx time of day.  (by the way, by the time I had already hired a programmer and he wrote to me an awesome Address book, just for me) In addition to everything else, there was another question to the client, which I will discuss later. <br><br>  I know that it seems too intrusive, and paranoid, to write down every client absolutely, and to make notes in your address to the beech ... but don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs a huge amount of work, but you will have such a huge database that is ###. <br><br>  Looking at this, my boss just fired from what I was doing and asked me a question: how to cope with this?  The client will need help and we will not be able to score on it, but to waste time ...!  Oh yeah!  This is a great job.  I answered simply and rudely.  Want easy money?  Take care of ShareWare software (litter sharovarschiki, I blurted out without thinking, I had to say about banditry) <br><br>  I'm talking about feedback, but what does this mean?  Literally translated as "feedback".  But how can there be feedback if there is no communication initially?  I will explain. <br><br><h2>  History from the past </h2><br>  <strong>Number one</strong> : I did and still do tattoo.  I am a master.  Clients from different cities came to me in Zaporizhia.  Not because the artist.  There are masters and steeper.  And because I have always had a lively communication and a lot of work directed to the client.  And naturally, in the n stages of creating a tattoo, there was a lot of communication!  And it was on almost friendly notes. <br>  I worked on the scheme, Tattoo in 3 calls.  The 1st is the outline, it heals, then the coloring, the shadows, healed, and then the finishing.  The method is good because when you start working on a tattoo, with a ready-made contour, you see all the skin irregularities, etc. <br>  <strong>Number two</strong> : A client came&gt; bought a Mac, and asked to set up just appeared People.net!  I just went out!  I was looking for info in nete, how devices using a similar standard are connected to Linux / Mac.  Tormented, set up.  The assistant asked me a question, why was it so much tormented for the client who bought one computer? <br>  As a result, he brought about 20 clients. <br><br>  What is the analogy with a tattoo?  In that I spared no effort, there was a lot of work, but simple conversations would not have led to the desired result, even with almost friendly communication. <br><br><h2>  Act </h2><br>  And so what I had in the end and how I used it. <br>  A client came to me somehow, they say, I need a powerful computer! .. Hmm ... ok.  And here, out of habit, the question about which I kept silent above. <br><br>  And what kind of tasks? <br><br><blockquote> If you buy MacPro drawings for rendering, then the role will not play 2 cores from you or 4, because CAD programs do not use the power of 2-4 cores, and why is there no point in taking Mac Pro?  There is!  Because based on Mac Pro, you can expand RAM to 16 gigs!  Yes, it's expensive!  But the redner will be faster, although it may not make sense to invest huge amounts of money in it.  - I do not remember what year it was </blockquote><br><br>  And so the client said that he needed a powerful computer to work with an external sound.  This is definitely FireWare and definitely Mac Pro, because the bus would ensure good performance and the power of the processor and RAM is needed.  Ok, there is a sale, there is a contact with tags (Processing, sound, call Saturday evening, a young guy, reper) <br><br>  And what's next?  I have a lot of tags in my mega-accountant, technical tags, because in a conversation I always tried to find out the type of activity (type of employment) of the client, and I recognized it in the smoking room, there was a room in Kiev and in the next project where customers watered coffee and talked.  Simple sales, ordinary, go to the flow of helpers.  I look at my tags and start to monitor new distributors, and news on the Internet (not necessary, but it would not be bad to know at least something about what you want to sell). <br><br>  and so there is some kind of new sound card, external, I call the distributors in order to get it?  I get a positive response.  Then I call the client and say (not a literal dialogue): <br><br><blockquote>  - Hello, do you remember the sound? <br>  - Yes <br>  - I've thought, maybe you will be interested in% devicename%? <br>  - Oh, yes ... I read about it recently, but what can? <br>  - Well, the same!  For our customers, we try! </blockquote><br><br>  Wham!  I bite.  Next game with prices, so that not the abode and the client does not shod.  It turned out that we are supposedly - a team of managers, we remember and think about it alone!  Wow!  Can you imagine?  In fact, we spent more on this transaction than earned, but the client became OUR and only, and then brought more people.  Although at that moment when he was a potential client, I was not at all interested in what he was talking about.  But I listened, spending time on it.  As a result, the relationship turned out as if almost friendly. <br><br>  Sometimes in communication there was information that, for example, client X has a daughter of 14 years.  Hmm, in such cases, I generally rolled up adventures ... I made a card, on it a set of numbers, a code or ID.  The code naturally saved.  I call the client closer to any holiday and I say: <br><br><blockquote>  - Hello!  I thought here, and if you want to give your daughter a gift, you can surprise her.  We have special gift cards!  You just come to us and take her.  If suddenly there is something suitable in the store, then you can come in the morning, pay a card, or buy one, and then bring your daughter. </blockquote><br><br>  Just an interesting point.  These are doubles, Bundles, as they are called.  And here they are to feedback?  And besides.  Very often, I called customers and talked about certain innovations.  But ... Big but.  I served it under different sauces.  For example: <br><br>  Call customer&gt; new external hardy&gt; but they are sold in a pair with card readers&gt; oO&gt; Yes!  But the price is reduced, and most importantly, to you, as OUR client, I can pour my media onto this screw.  so to speak to share the accumulated music collection. <br><br>  Here it is important to observe one nuance - DO NOT SELL it!  PV means that there is no legislative platform in such cases, it is enough to create a file signed with an ordinary gpg key, it is free, and upload the file to a disk, and leave a copy for yourself, information will be stored there that the material is provided for review + file creation date.  But it is more necessary for you, what if something is covered up with ###. <br><br>  I used tags in my database, sound processing, a daughter, or something else that can give information!  This is the 4th point of my panacea.  Tags, brief information about the type of activity that will give me an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat can be offered to this person.  And not necessarily that this product was on the shelf of your store! <br><br>  I said there was another moment, this is the Time for calls!  This is the 5th fad.  Every day, in the late afternoon, so as not to distract yourself from routine tasks, new sales, etc.  I rested for 30-40-60 minutes to free my head, and accepted to work with my mega contact accountant.  Yeah, today is Friday, who is on Friday.  I chose n number of phone numbers, and rushed! <br><br>  SPAMER pancake!  - you say.  Oh no what about you!  One of the important features that I did not mention is the HISTORY of the customer‚Äôs purchases.  I led her too.  And I saw when and how much a person bought.  Naturally, I would not call him the next week and offer something, without a special occasion.  Although this happened.  Plus, the detour (calls) of clients for festive periods, did not begin long before the holidays, just called and said that we certainly would have something tasty for OUR clients for the holidays, keep in mind.  And even those who did not have time to call on holidays, they themselves called back. <br><br><h2>  Wow, how much work?  Are you a monster? </h2><br>  No, I'm not a monster, and this is all more than real!  This is my practice!  The most difficult thing about this is all customer accounting and keeping a history of their purchases.  In this regard, I was saved by stickers, sticky notes, such yellowish ones, because the comp was not always at hand, but the stickers are always in your pocket (well, you can not sticky, the main thing is not to lose).  And then in his free time, at the end of the day he sat down and added his customers to the database.  I never wrote down the exact model of the company in history, it is not necessary.  General information will be enough. <br><br>  Another thing I didn‚Äôt mention was the client card.  A very unnecessary card that has a client ID and that's it.  But under it and under this ID you will be able to fasten the history of purchases in the e-store, website, come up with a system of discounts, if necessary, and in general a lot of things.  But all this is not her main role!  The main role of this card is that the client belongs to something!  And I made 3 types of cards in my time.  And for some clients it was warm for him that he was a VIP client, and he returned to us again and again. <br><br>  And so I will try to make it all in brief. <br><br>  My feedback model. <br><br>  Rules: <br>  1 Make the client understand that he is important. <br>  2 Contact Cataloging <br>  3 callbacks, under any circumstances <br>  4 Use of customer information <br>  5 Calls to the client at a certain time <br><br>  Instruments: <br>  <strong>Addressbook</strong> - there can be anything that can put a lot of information, a local browser program, a UI program, XL, Google Docs <br>  <strong>Work phone</strong> - It is desirable 2-3-4 that is convenient for customers, different operators, etc. <br><br>  Methods: <br>  <strong>Friendly communication</strong> : as if friendly (requires the ability to play in the framework of the lack of open pofigizma). <br>  <strong>Constant, periodic status reminders</strong> : You are our client! <br>  <strong>Accounting for customer interaction history</strong> <br><br>  <strong>Playing on the type / status / position of the client</strong> : very often it was necessary to play on the fact that the client prints to layer X, and to play along, the simplest example, on the VIP, a specific game was in the direction of ‚Äúthe steep have APple and the newest and pathetic <br><br>  And now a little more about the mechanics.  After Kiev, I worked on a new project of an online store in Dnepropetrovsk.  Not the capital but still.  The first two months I was mainly engaged in sales, excluding feedback.  Accumulated customer base.  After that, he delegated some of the powers, and went into work under feedback.  Sometimes I even met customers for a cup of coffee.  I have to say that there were also difficult customers, but if you are going to get involved in sales, keep in mind you must be sociable. <br><br>  And so the start of the 2nd quarter of 2008, the start, after the quarter, we made 100% of sales.  But in the 3rd quarter of 2008, we made 100% Predazh + 40% (from the 2nd quarter) sales from feedback.  It provided that I was engaged in sales and assistants, only 3 people.  The point is not about total earnings, but about that ~ 40% of additional sales of the 3rd quarter were built on competent feedback.  In addition, please note, and the store was not all-Ukrainian! <br><br>  I will also say that in fact the main work was reduced to the ability to speak, play up to the situation, and customer accounting.  Communication + information is 80% -90% success.  Working with trifles, such as remembering that the client has a daughter ... and so on, is also very, very important.  And I was tired of sooooo, by the sales I was hanging on the organization and planning of advertising campaigns (this is generally a separate conversation)!  But the exhaust from this was in salary. <br><br>  The online store must have an <strong>Account Manager</strong> , and if this person also knows the product and is able to sell.  pff ... yes then you all break up.  Because it is the <strong>Account manager that</strong> serves as the bridge that will not allow the i-shop to forget the customer after the purchase. <br><br>  I resulted in the post only a tiny part of what it was.  I mean ways to communicate with customers and methods for creating proposals for them.  But so the text would have turned out even more. <br><br>  Business is a paperwork ¬©! (In my opinion, Rockefeller said this) <br><br>  this whole topic came out of reading this topic -&gt; " <a title="Little things decide everything" href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/79348/">Trivialities decide everything</a> " - so if it is interesting, and you liked my topic a little bit, I will write about trifles, why they decided everything in my work. <br><br>  With respect to Habravchan and thanks to them for their karma! <br><br>  PS sorry for unstructured text.  But live I talk 100 times 1000 times better =) <br><br>  <strong>UPDATE</strong> I sincerely apologize for the writing style !!! <br>  <strong>UPDATE 2</strong> Thanks for the karma, moved to the blog "Learn to work." <br>  <strong>UPDATE 3</strong> How much topic already weighs ...)) you can tweet your here to stick?  <a href="http://twitter.com/macgera">Fallavmi</a> <br>  <strong>UPDATE 4</strong> Continuation <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/79725/">They say the new year, everything always happens, everything always happens, sales are obtained</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79429/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79429/</a></p>
