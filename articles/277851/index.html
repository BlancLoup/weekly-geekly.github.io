The program turned out to be extensive: in addition to vacancies with online interviews, we prepared webinars that cover various areas of IT and software.  Today, non-stop one after another will be 9 webinars.  Especially for ‚ÄúHabr‚Äù I asked the authors of the webinars to talk about their topics, details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can see the full schedule of webinars at the end of the article.  From myself, I note that the program turned out to be rich and designed for different specialists: from team leaders and project managers to analysts and (future) data scientists. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/20/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Ddatascience%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">Data Science: where to start an experienced programmer (15:00 - 15:45)</a></b> <br>  <i>Peter Ermakov (@couatl), Data Scientist in HeadHunter</i>

The written Random forest algorithm took up several thousand lines of C ++ code, and finding a good implementation on the Internet was not a trivial task.  The power of my desktop computer made it possible to solve a simple problem in just one night.  To summarize, data analysis is long, difficult and very inconvenient.  It was.  Now all the popular machine learning algorithms are already implemented in libraries, which are for most of the currently popular programming languages.  So for example, the launch of the same Random forest in the Python language looks like: <br><br><pre><code class="python hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> pandas <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">as</span></span> pd <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span></span> sklearn.ensemble <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> RandomForestClassifier train = pd.read_csv(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'train.csv'</span></span>) test = pd.read_csv(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'test.csv'</span></span>) rf = RandomForestClassifier() predict = rf.fit(train.drop(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'target'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>), train.target).predict(test)</code> </pre> <br>  6 lines of code and a prediction based on the Random forest algorithm is ready.  If you look closely, the data analysis is concluded only in the only last line. <br>  Someone will say that if you measure lines, then you can write a single C ++ code in general.  But it will not be so elegant :) Although it will be right that the measure with lines of code is not always objective. <br>  Someone might say that this is not data analysis: there is no cross-validation, therefore retraining is possible;  there is no work with the data, because we do not use the information from the data at 100%.  This is true, but you will learn this from a webinar, and the code is just an example. <br>  Of course, after the 50 minute lecture, you will not become an expert in the field of data analysis and will not go to the top of Kaggle.  This is not the goal (why do I need competitors? :)) <br>  The goal is to tell you that it‚Äôs easy to start analyzing data and you can start today. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/15/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Dscrumtreck%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">How to make engineering decisions in the face of uncertainty?</a></b>  <b><a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/15/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Dscrumtreck%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">(12:00 - 12:45)</a></b> <br>  <i>Sergey Baranov, Agile Architecture / Agile Coaching, ScrumTrek</i> <br>  Every day we, as developers, architects, system administrators, product owners, are faced with the problem of choice, the problem of making engineering decisions.  Brave masters debugger and compiler - directly;  the customer - sometimes not even knowing it.  Not the last role in our decisions is played by the peculiarities of the human psyche and behavior.  Programmers are eager to satisfy their engineering ambitions, administrators are wary of everything new and unknown (of course, not always :)), the experience of past years inevitably brings us to the static world of habits and a deceptive sense of certainty.  But the world is not like that.  And each decision, be it the number of classes in the package, the speed of the sorting algorithm, the choice of the framework or the percentage of code coverage of tests, we must take consciously and reasonably.  This webinar is about how to be guided when there is so much unknown around, and how not to be led by habit and false confidence. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/22/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Deldorado%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">Challenges posed by e-commerce and retail analytics (14:00 - 14:45)</a></b> <br>  <i>Anton Lukyanov / Head of Internet Analytics Group at Eldorado</i> <br>  Everyone agrees that the result is very important - evaluation at the university, winning the competition, award for a successfully completed project.  But on the way to achieving a result, you constantly need to make decisions.  In order to make an informed decision, we need information and tools for its interpretation.  It is the collection of information and conclusions from it - what modern analyst does. <br><br>  If you are thinking about a change of profession or have just received a diploma and choose the direction to start a career, if you want to get results and help the business to achieve them, if you want to make an informed choice of profession and get a result - successfully pass the interview to the analyst position, then you need information . <br><br>  At the webinar we will go the way the analyst encounters in his work: <br><ul><li>  What we decide?  Classic tasks faced by the analyst.  Prediction, evaluation, optimization. </li><li>  Where does the data come from?  Analytical data storage.  Features of the infrastructure required in retail analytics. </li><li>  How to solve?  Analytics tools.  Scripting languages ‚Äã‚Äãas the main tool of work.  Pros and cons of Enterprise solutions.  Open source solutions. </li><li>  Analytics for business or business for analytics?  On the importance of communication between departments. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad8/8a3/f04/ad88a3f042fc450ea0f0e54871bd7ffe.png"><br>  At the end of the webinar there will be a checklist of basic skills for successful work in analytics and a list of resources for further development. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/19/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Dagile%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">Basics of Agile for developers (18:00 - 19:00).</a></b> <br>  <i>Boris Volfson, HeadHunter Development Director</i> <br>  Some time ago I formulated for myself the way I understand Agile: ‚ÄúAgile - approaches to creating products through the continuous, quick supply of valuable working functionality by a self-organized team of professionals in collaboration with the customer.‚Äù  As part of this webinar, we will look at how a flexible development model has emerged as opposed to a waterfall one. <br><br>  Let's look at the Agile values ‚Äã‚Äãon which flexible practices and methodologies are built: <br><ol><li>  people and interaction is more important than processes and tools; </li><li>  a working product is more important than comprehensive documentation; </li><li>  cooperation with the customer is more important than agreeing the terms of the contract; </li><li>  willingness to change is more important than following the original plan. </li></ol><br>  You will learn more about Scrum (roles, processes and artifacts) and useful practices that are commonly used with this framework: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6a/1a8/0dc/a6a1a80dc16c48e9bd63855a478d112b.png"><br><br><h4>  Full webinar schedule </h4><br>  <i>Time is Moscow time.</i>  <i>Webinar can be immediately put in the calendar, so as not to miss.</i>  <i>All webinars are free.</i> <br><br>  10:00 - 10:45 - <a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/16/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Drinok_truda%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">Labor Market Overview for IT Professionals</a> <br>  11:00 - 11:45 - <a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/17/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Ddengi_v_it%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">Money in IT: state-owned companies, start-ups, outsourcing, product, etc.</a>  <a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/17/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Ddengi_v_it%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">Where does a programmer live well?</a> <br>  12:00 - 12:45 - <a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/24/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Dmvideo%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">The role of an IT professional in a company using enterprise solutions</a> <br>  13:00 - 13:45 - <a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/15/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Dscrumtreck%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">How to make engineering decisions in the face of uncertainty?</a> <br>  14:00 - 14:45 - <a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/22/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Deldorado%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">Tasks posed by e-commerce and retail analytics</a> <br>  15:00 - 15:45 - <a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/20/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Ddatascience%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">Data Science: how to start an experienced programmer</a> <br>  16:00 - 16:45 - <a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/23/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Dkasperskii%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">Kaspersky Lab: not only antiviruses</a> <br>  5:00 pm - 5:45 pm - <a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/18/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Dinnopolos%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">Work in a company or a master‚Äôs program: reveal the pros and cons for the developer</a> <br>  18:00 - 18:45 - <a href="http://expo.hh.ru/webinars/19/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Dagile%26utm_campaign%3Dsoisk">Agile Basics for Developers</a> <br><br><h4>  About ‚ÄúOnline Job Fair‚Äù </h4><br>  ‚ÄúOnline job fair‚Äù is an event, and the logic of job search here is different from working sites.
