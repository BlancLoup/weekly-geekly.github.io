      The essence of the project is the organization and conduct of masterclasses for 4+ audiences, in different directions - this is robotics, programming, 3D printing, and performances and much more.  The 2015 program can be read <a href="http://tehnotvorchestvo.ru/2015">here</a> . <br><br>  The festival was already held in February 2014, then 18 events took place at 9 venues in Yekaterinburg.  More than 500 schoolchildren and students took part in the festival. <br><br>  Read more about the festival and this year's program. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How was the festival formed?  Here is what Irina Zakirova (executive director of the festival) says about this: <br><blockquote><img title="Reseda Rybalko Festival Director" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2aa/216/c8a/2aa216c8afd1477f8a5946762404f992.png" align="right"><img title="Irina Zakirova Executive Director" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7c/868/e87/d7c868e875854ca99b928a4dcc91c269.png" align="left">  Everything happened in the summer of 2013.  Ideas, as a rule, do not come spontaneously.  Not only insight is important, but also the period of incubation, when an idea is born.  And also the experience that always remains with you.  We with Rezeda (Reseda Rybalko - the head of the festival) were helped by our ten years of experience with gifted high school students.  Despite the fact that the Center ‚ÄúGiftedness and Technologies‚Äù, in which we worked, was actually closed by reorganization, our experience and team of students and teachers of COT remained with us.  The team in which we created educational events and projects of the city, region and region.  With high school students, we learned how to develop ideas, work in a team, make choices, make decisions and take responsibility for the situation. <br><br>  The social and educational project ‚ÄúFestival‚Äú City of Techno-Creativity ‚Äùhas become our civic initiative.  The festival was completely made by volunteers.  Basically, it is young people aged 14 to 30 years.  Many volunteers were alumni of COT and our students. </blockquote><br><br>  The motto of the festival was the words of the festival supervisor Novoselov Sergey Arkadyevich: <br><blockquote><img title="Sergey Novoselov Scientific Director, Institute Director" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/407/bd5/474/407bd54746c244bba76a81c08c540c5e.png">  You can teach to invent any and in any field.  It is important to create a motive to make the child interesting. </blockquote><br><br>  Overview of the festival: <br><br><h5>  <b>Excursion to the center of prototyping and prototyping of Ural Federal University [February 5]</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b8/528/85e/3b852885eaa6391caf69e089951beb21.jpg" alt="Powder 3D printer"><br><br>  In our city there is a wonderful center " <a href="http://inno.urfu.ru/pages/innovacionno-vnedrencheskie-centry/centr-maketirovanija-i-prototipirovanija.php">Layout and prototyping at UrFU</a> ", about which there <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/coolrf/blog/201518/">was an article</a> on Habr√© (photo from the article). <br><br>  There is a 3D powder printer - which allows you to print color 3D models.  <a href="http://tehnotvorchestvo.ru/2015/actions/exc_center_propotip">Information on the tour</a> . <br><br><h5>  <b>Techno Workshop "Collect a Robot"</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51a/c79/274/51ac79274ad24398b26a8052ec28e2ff.jpg"><br><br>  To get acquainted with robotics with the support of our hackspace, the first public club of robotics is open, working every day (from 2 to 8 February) from 10:00 to 22:00, in the Greenwich shopping center, level 3, next to the playground.  <a href="http://tehnotvorchestvo.ru/2015/actions/technomasterskaya">more details</a> . <br><br><h5>  <b>Vibrobot</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/394/eff/a27/394effa274ab8ac0ce22e7f9bed7cc1e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A vibrobot is a simple ‚Äúrobot‚Äù consisting of a vibro-motor, a battery, a body (cardboard cup) and flamasters.

Denis responded to our proposal to participate in the festival, and set up 5 interactive installations for the City of Craft Works festival - including at the opening of the festival (in the photo - one of the works of Denis - "The <a href="http://uralvision.blogspot.ru/2011/08/blog-post.html">Interactive Installation of Man-Moth</a> "). <br><br>  Lecture <a href="http://tehnotvorchestvo.ru/2015/actions/progr_of_future">Programming the future.</a>  <a href="http://tehnotvorchestvo.ru/2015/actions/progr_of_future">How to teach a computer to do what is necessary, without any programming [February 05]</a> <br><br>  In the framework of "TechnoNoch": From 20.00 to 23.00 - Light, color and sound installations.

Or stomp your foot, and beams of light appear around.  Magic!

To become a participant in the techno-marathon, you need to push the team out of a teacher and 3 schoolchildren, register on the festival website and pay the cost of a 3D printer component.  <a href="http://tehnotvorchestvo.ru/2015/actions/marafon3dprint">Read more</a> <br><br><h5>  <b>Links</b> </h5><br>  In this review it is impossible to cover all the events, for details see the program. <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://tehnotvorchestvo.ru/">Festival site "City of Technical Works"</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://tehnotvorchestvo.ru/2015">Festival program for 2015</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://tehnotvorchestvo.ru/technomap/">Project "Map of Technical Creativity"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vk.com/tehnogorod_ekb">Festival page, VKontakte</a> </li></ul><br>  The ‚ÄúCity of Techno-Creativity‚Äù festival is a civic initiative of enthusiasts, and no one has set goals for commercial gain, but if you want to support the project financially ( <a href="http://tehnotvorchestvo.ru/donate">Charitable contribution to the festival of Technological Creativity</a> ), these funds will be used to further develop the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe festival. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249781/</a></p>
