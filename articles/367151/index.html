  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GoPro pre-flight training</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello.  Finally, the hands got to writing a small article about preparing Gopro for flight.  Now, of course, no one can surprise anyone with copters with GoPro on board.  However, after 3 years of flying with GoPro, I had little experience on some of the pre-camera preparation issues for the flight.  Most copterovodov know about them, but still collect them in this article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05e/161/a68/05e161a685244d3ea7d0e9798a6f7b90.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once on a warm sunny day, I went out of the house ... to fly.  It was at the cottage.  15 minutes flew off and returned to land.  At 2 meters from the ground, one of the engines gave a wedge from overheating, and the quadrics, respectively, fell down.  "Yes, don't care ... change a couple of screws," I thought.  However, the problem was worse.  Having collected everything in a heap, I turned on the camera, and the video was not transmitted to the monitor.  And then I discovered that the USB port in the camera is moving.  In short, the wire connecting the camera and the video transmitter pulled the usb out of the camera from hitting the ground.  ‚ÄúOkay, I'll take it to repair phones, solder‚Äù - I decided.  That's not it.  Soldered then soldered, the camera was charging, but the video output died.  A small "shorty" at the time of "breaking" the port and everything ... was enough.  In short, this camera worked as before, but I no longer had to fly with it.  This was my first gopro of the 3rd version.  And now I want to explain why this ‚Äúparsley‚Äù came out.  EBay sells several wire types for GoPro. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e5f/8b8/003/e5f8b80032de40a692471fdce90180b3.jpg">

      And at that time I had this suspension: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/560/b9a/1c6/560b9a1c630a439baa99d1bf6b5fc6cc.jpg"><br><br>  The trick is that for a good balancing of the camera it should be practically ‚Äúright next to‚Äù the engine of suspension.  Therefore, the distance for the wire there is practically no.  Naturally, the connector number 1 does not suit us.  Wow!  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/4p">‚Ññ4 *</a> !  He will fit in there perfectly!  Here in this wire trick and was.  Unlike No. 2 and <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/4q">No. 3 *,</a> this wire really did take its place perfectly, but there was a problem.  In the usb port of the camera, he was inserted with effort and also with the effort removed.  It was this effort that played its role when the kopter was more beautiful.  I do not know why, but these wires (with such a connector) are very tightly inserted into the camera.  In other words, the best option would be wire <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/4q">number 3 *</a> with thin wiring leaving "up from the camera."  First, they will not interfere with the operation of the motors (they will not create unnecessary voltage due to the absence of a thick braid), and the connector itself will be easily connected.  Of course, the camera will shift slightly to the side, but the percentage of the port‚Äôs ‚Äúviability‚Äù will increase. <br><br>  Further I will tell about a situation with which many are familiar.  Strobe light from the blades.  In other words, we are flying, shooting, and black stripes appear on the video.  This is the strobe from the blades.  This effect occurs when the sunlight coming ‚Äúinto our camera‚Äù on a tangent is blocked by rotating blades.  To cut off this effect, a hood is needed.  Well, of course, there are also two options: either to buy it or buy it.  Well, of course, why should a Russian person buy something if he can do it himself?  I made this blend of minutes in 15 of the usual ‚Äúpencil glue‚Äù.  On a happy occasion, the diameter of this tube was just under the diameter of the GoPro lens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76c/506/b0b/76c506b0b8814be78d0d653051bb3f30.jpg"><br><br>  Such a blend does not cost anything to do, and do not have to spend money or wait for the parcel.  And it costs at least <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/4r">300-400 rubles *</a> . <br><br>  Well, the last thing I would like to talk about is the power of the camera.  Initially, the camera during the flight simply ‚Äúate‚Äù its battery.  And once in the winter I was overwhelmed by one situation.  It was necessary to take an interesting shot, but the first double failed, because the copter just sat down, and after replacing it, the second shot failed, since the GoPro battery had sat down.  The result was dancing with a tambourine and not shooting.  Then I decided that the camera should be charged right on board the copter.  Well, there were 3 options: charging from a separate BEC, charging from a BEC from one of the regulators, and charging from a video transmitter. <br><br>  The most versatile way is to charge from a separate BEC.  There are actually a lot of them, but for an example I can offer <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/4s">this *</a> .  It can convert voltages from 2 to 6 canned batteries to 5V voltage specifically for our GoPro. <br>  By the way, the power supply to the camera occurs through the same wire, which we talked about at the beginning.  Choose a wire so that it not only transmits video, but also can charge the camera. <br><br>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/4t">Here is a wire with built-in BEC *</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d1/659/42b/0d165942bf634c668b4c5039094e178f.jpg"><br><br>  I'm currently charging the GoPro from a video transmitter.  Since my video transmitter is capable of outputting both 12V and 5V, I did not have to buy a back.  I advise you to look at the instructions to your transmitters, if you do not know how much they give out, because  most only give out 12V for powering FPV cameras.  If you check the "spear" method, then when a small smoke comes from the camera, it will be possible to say with confidence that there was 12V.  :) Now I don‚Äôt even remember about charging the camera ever.  I can at least take it out for shooting, it is still in the process it works and charges. <br><br>  That's basically all the "improvements" that will not make you much "overwork", but will greatly facilitate flying and shooting with this amazing camera. <br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for selecting complex technology <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> <br>  Do not forget to subscribe to our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/">blog</a> , there will be many more interesting things. <br><br>  ps * - links marked with an asterisk referral, so you can save money by returning cashback up to 4%.
