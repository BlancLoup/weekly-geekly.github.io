Written article, as one of many similar, only describes a special case of arrogant manager and his style of interviewing, but no more. <br><br>  Having moved to Japan 7 years ago, I was interviewed at many companies, from restaurants to investment banks, one of which I currently work at.  In the past, I worked as a project manager.  The company was a host tour operator focused on demanding clients from Russia, so I was entrusted with conducting interviews for guide-interpreters.

      <br>
      Having experience in interviews from both the table and the chair, I would like to express my vision of the problem. <br><br>  What manages the companies that conduct interviews? <br><br>  Without an answer to this question, there is no point in making recommendations on preparing for interviews, since they will do more harm than good for both the applicant and the impulsive recruiting manager who are inspired by the aggressive advice. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Interviewing for interviews. <br><br>  Every person who receives an invitation for an interview, in his heart sincerely hopes (thinks, believes, wants to believe) that in order to receive the coveted offer, it is enough just to be a competent specialist, prepare for a number of questions, dress well and teach yourself from the right side.  In fact, in most cases, crossing the threshold of a room in a Spartan style, a person is involved in someone else's game, the goals of which may not be what it seems at first glance. <br><br>  1. Free advertising and status games <br><br>  When linking the Careers link on the corporate website, the company emphasizes its own importance.  If a company develops, then, often, it needs new personnel, therefore information about hiring is a kind of indicator of success.  Often the need to maintain a reputation is much higher than the need for hiring. <br><br>  Company M, in which I work, annually receives thousands of resumes from candidates, opening a set.  At the same time, specialists with experience, once past 30 laps of interviews, stress tests, hanging upside down and torture with hunger, are fired more often than new employees are accepted. <br><br>  Often, the worse things are for a company, the more actively it throws dust into the eyes with juicy vacancies, confusing investors, customers and ... job seekers. <br><br>  When you get an interview at such a company, you become a character in a staged show led by political interests rather than practical goals.  As soon as you feel the incredible grandeur of the process, you see beautiful eight-step questionnaires on the employer's website, and when you come for an interview, you feel like a clown in a suit among a dozen of the same people who are locked in one room without furniture, then know that you are just playing .  And, perhaps, even making fun, watching the process of rat race through the mirror glass. <br><br>  Even if you are lucky enough to win this lottery, do not rejoice too much.  The future in such companies is muddy, because you were hired not because you really needed, but because you had to hire. <br><br>  2. Mastering the budget <br><br>  Imagine that companies really need personnel. <br>  The company's management, highlighting the budget with the hope of supplying quality specialists, stumbles upon a big rake.  The personnel department not only does not supply the best specialists, but also eats up a huge part of the company's budget. <br><br>  It is the lordly approach, as a sign, when recruiting staff that speaks of the decay and bureaucratization of the personnel department (ch. ‚ÄúThe presence of metastasis in the company‚Äù), which exists for itself.  The task of such a department is not to pick the right person who really brings a lot of useful things to the company, but to justify their own existence and master the allocated budget.  Often, preference is given not to the best candidate, but to that candidate, who after some time can be easily dismissed and begin to look for a new one, demonstrating his own need.  The personnel departments, in this case, remind doctors who need not cured, but treated patients ... <br><br>  If you feel that the questions are tyrannical or stamped, you can safely leave the interrogation office and look for a more promising place for the application of your professional and mental strength. <br><br>  3. Intelligence <br><br>  The company wants something, but does not know for itself exactly what it is. <br>  Staff recruitment in such companies is comparable to a walk of girlfriends shopping at a weekend without a specific goal. <br>  At the interviews you can squeeze an interesting idea in the absence of your own, and also really come across a competent specialist who will change everything. <br><br>  The problem is that exploration companies are extremely unstable and change their plans on the go.  Work in such companies is not much different from playing in a casino.  If you are lucky, you will be heard, and you will be able to take a seat at the throne.  If you're not lucky ... well, you understand me, right? <br><br>  Instead of epilogue <br><br>  The interview should be a meeting of two adequate people with mutual interest.  The task of an adequate employer is to explain briefly and succinctly why he needs a specialist, therefore, before opening a position, you must clearly answer yourself the simple question: ‚ÄúDoes the company need this specialist in principle?‚Äù.  Is it worth spending your own time, as well as the time and nerves of the candidates, if the company itself really does not know why it needs an employee.  It sounds logical and simple, right?  Getting on interview in the next company, try to feel what they want from you.  If you are able to understand and learn to see the situation as it really is, it will be more difficult to mislead you, and your life will become much simpler.  In any case, the nerves will be saved much easier. <br><br>  And do not be alarmed when one day a pleasant man without a tie asks you only 5-6 short questions about the essence of your profession, smiles, thanks you for coming to the interview and says only one phrase: ‚ÄúWe take you‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285566/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285566/</a></p>
