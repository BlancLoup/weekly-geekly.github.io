We wondered if anyone wanted to participate, and if so, how much quality and innovative the proposed works would be.  However, after the first applications began to arrive, a sigh of relief was carried around the office - the applications presented were quite good. <br><br>  About 1,000 developers from different parts of the globe took part in the competition, and after many hours of testing and fierce debate, we were finally able to reduce the list to six of the most attractive works.  In our decisions, we proceeded from six main messages: <br><ul><li>  How well does the work look and complete? </li><li>  Does it open up Evernote from an unexpected side? </li><li>  Does the job respond to the needs expressed by our user community? </li><li>  Can it inspire people to create a new type of application? </li><li>  Well, in general, how cool was the application? </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Your vote matters </h3><br>  Below you can see a list of six final works.  The authors of each of them have already received $ 5,000 and are now fighting for first place in the competition and the grand prix of $ 50,000. If you have some free time, pay attention to these works, watch their videos, try the applications in action, if possible and vote.  Try to vote for an idea that you like, even if its implementation is not currently available for your device or platform.  The best way to encourage developers to work further on a great idea is to express their sympathy for their creations.
