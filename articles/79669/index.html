I will say more - they are decently older than me) But because no less interesting.  Welcome under the cut! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Judging by the number of positive reviews and comments in the reviews of other headphones like ‚Äú <i>yes nafig - I have a <a href="http://koss.ru/">Koss</a> port and I am satisfied</i> ‚Äù, the headphones are really good.  Well, at the same time you can check my objectivity)

The box is not from the category of Chinese hrenovin - not ashamed and as a gift) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d28/3b6/683/d283b668351bfd8990e9b6f60122686f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside, in the foam rubber layers, the headphones themselves are inserted, an adapter from 3.5mm to 6.3mm and a case rolled up into a tube.  At first I even thought that it was some kind of (for some reason) flashlight ... but it really is not more than just a cover with a cord. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/120/019/eeb/120019eeb6f241e5062dac7f3ebcee9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  Headphones ... well, I don‚Äôt know - they don‚Äôt want to gain trust with their design) A thin metal arcuate headband (thanks to which the headphones can be twisted into a ring for transportation) connects the two ‚Äúears‚Äù and allows them to move along this very arc, depending on the size of the listening head. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec8/32c/2e2/ec832c2e22f48734cdb9cdff99d8ad9c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Above the "ears" are foam inserts for a more thorough fixation, as well as the correct location of the headphones on the head. <br><br>  The speakers themselves have a small degree of freedom - they can rotate at a small angle relative to the axis of the headband, which can also have a positive effect on the convenience of fixation.  But the fit is still not the best - whatever one may say, and the sound from the outside world will penetrate under the flat soft ear cushions.  The wire goes to both sides, and the wire is strong enough (at least at first glance), with a straight plug on the end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ec/ad5/4f1/7ecad54f14b312c557ca0107bc45475c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, the headphones are very nicely located on the head - they do not press very much.  And at the same time, these are not some huge objects, which make it difficult to turn your head - the weight of the ‚Äúears‚Äù is so small that at some moments you forget that you have headphones on.  <i>Who is gadget-hung, am I gad-goose ?!</i>  (with) :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/49c/516/b2b/49c516b2ba2d20c169af378771f75b2f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Sound </h2><br>  As for the sound, the pro port has remained a popular model of overhead headphones for many years now for a reason.  The first thing you notice when you listen to these headphones is stunning deep bass.  Such a deep and saturated low-frequency range is rarely found even in much more expensive headphones.  However, this is not the only merit of the Porta Pro.  Practically any listener who is not spoiled by expensive portable equipment, but who is accustomed to listening to players with complete headphones, will be extremely impressed with the overall sound quality.  Both high and medium frequencies are worked out quite well and sound played, whole, with good natural sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/045/2ed/90d/0452ed90d754d65d22328f7ca1e32a9d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Electronic recordings on the port sound very impressive - powerful, dynamic, with excellent depth and detail.  Very good headphones themselves show when playing other music genres.  Perhaps only hard rock is clearly not their element - although its sound has full weight, but hard corrugated chords of bass guitars and elastic beats of bass barrels are displayed very simply.  Because of this, the aggression so necessary for metal suffers significantly.  However, in my opinion, this is the only noticeable disadvantage of the Porta Pro. <br><br><h2>  Coinz </h2><br>  You may have noticed a small token (or a coin?) On the pics.  It is pleasantly heavy, metallic, relief.  The inscription says that supposedly Koss Porta Pro headphones turned 25 years old and it would be time to get a cake with 25 candles ... But I, frankly, am somewhat perplexed by this figure and really do not understand what it means.  25 years ago I wasn‚Äôt even in the project, so I can‚Äôt say anything at all about the sound quality of the model of those years :) So it was unlikely a quarter of a century ago that these ears were exactly with this design and sound quality.  A "new old" model, sort of like, all the years old so 5-6.  Maybe 25 just knocked the name of the model, which is a kind of abstract guarantor of sound quality?  May be so.  But no matter how there was, I congratulate the hero of the day) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ed/a4a/2ed/0eda4a2edd134ece23d097407a63cd7b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This bonus is only available in a limited number of <b>Koss Porta Pro 25th Anniversary Edition</b> headphones, which are no different from the version.  Well, as nothing ... except at the price and limited edition - with this very coin :) <br><br>  And yet ... who else has any version?  :) <br><br><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  - Case included; <br>  - Metal headband, foldable design; <br>  - Good almost ‚Äúomnivorous‚Äù sound, price / quality ratio; <br>  - Price. <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - The design is so "transparent" that I personally have almost no confidence; <br>  - Judging by the reviews, over time there may be problems with the L-shaped connector; <br>  - Weak insulation, not the most powerful "clip" to the ears. <br><br>  The price for the ‚Äúwith a coin‚Äù version is about 1,300 rubles, while the cost of a standard configuration starts from 800 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/90e/dd8/19a/90edd819abc3c2eaced013efc0aff2e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  The end </h2><br>  Eh ... about ten years ago I was an avid metal artist - James was a kind of idol and I literally did not get out of black T-shirts with skulls.  And maybe I still would have listened to METAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL and wore a beard, if somehow everything all at one time did not dissipate or disappear) Despite the "ancient" age of Koss Porta Pro, which means there is little chance of unconsciously hearing them at that time, no there is no merit in this plan) Now I just listen to different music to my mood and that's it. <br>  So if the listener is not an ardent fan of rock, and is also not going to spend several thousand on the purchase of expensive headphones, then he can safely recommend the heroes of this review, who have not lost their charm after a solid age. <br>  Taking into account the cost and the fact that it plays out one hundred percent, these headphones can be taken for home or everyday wear, as well as a gift to someone who treats notes without snobbery. <br><br>  Here it is. <br><br>  Link to twitter in the same place) <br>  <b>Successes and with the coming!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79669/</a></p>
