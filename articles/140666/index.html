  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The future of information development. Utopia or the end of the world?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://vrn-nlp-texnika.ru/images/img-32.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I think everyone, at least once thought about the topic - what will the development of information technologies lead to, and how it will affect our life with you.  I want to present you, in my opinion, a very likely course of events, not such a distant future. <br><br>  Very often, the human brain is compared with a kind of computer - a device that is capable of reading, storing, storing, processing, and reproducing information.  But how this human computer works is still a mystery.  The principles of its work are not fully known.  Although the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow information is stored and processed, which areas exist and are responsible for what has already been formed, unfortunately, the brain is still a black box. <br><br>  Now let's imagine <a name="habracut"></a>  - science and technology have reached such a level that the problem of reading and writing information in the brain is solved.  That all the component parts are known, and which of these parts is responsible for what, as well as how you can influence these parts of the brain to perform information input / output operations.  That is, you can work as with a regular computer.  But there is another problem.  The information exchange protocol inside the brain was invented by nature.  And in order to interpret the read data, write down correct data that can be somehow interpreted by the brain, you need to adhere to this protocol for exchanging data and storing them in the proper format.  This is a very laborious task, which, I think, will be solved sooner or later, but it will take a very long time.

      Again, imagine that we know the protocol of the brain, and the methods of reading and writing are also available to us.  It turns out that any information can be loaded into the brain.  You can teach a person any skill.  There are endless possibilities. <br><br>  Nowadays, scientists are talking about several components of our mind: the consciousness and the subconscious.  Again, turning to the terminology of computer systems, we can draw the following analogy.  The subconscious acts as a kind of core, which provides some API for controlling the human body.  And consciousness is a controlling, dynamic program that has a data area.  She constantly operates with this data, and is also able to call the API functions of the subconscious.  Some of these APIs are public, that is, accessible to consciousness, and some are hidden inside.  Such as functions of regulating body temperature, metabolic functions, and others are not accessible to consciousness.  It turns out the usual class, with public and private methods.  These methods, when called, have a number of parameters that are transmitted by the mind during execution.  These parameter sets are quite extensive, because such a simple function as ‚Äúpronounce the sound‚Äù, for example, should contain all the information about the sound that needs to be pronounced: what kind of sound, duration, timbre of the voice and others.  The subconscious is able to learn and encapsulate certain algorithms in new functions.  An example of such training is, for example, how a person learns to ride a bicycle.  First, all the attention is directed to what movements and how to make, so as not to fall, and go.  After training, the subconscious mind remembers what to do if we want to ‚Äúride a bike‚Äù and do it for us, allowing us not to think about how we need to move our foot or arm.  This is a remarkable property that suggests that the subconscious is expandable, and by writing new functions to it, you can teach a person new skills.  For example, how to drive a plane, or ride a surfboard.  Anything.  We get extensibility at the functional level.  But the functional is not enough, if you do not have the necessary data to call this functional.  This data is conscious.  And this data can be both read and write new.  This allows you to make a huge leap in the study of something.  Simply write the necessary data.  Again, with a slight reservation that we know the methods of writing and reading, as well as protocols and data storage structures in the brain. <br><br>  And what are the prospects open to a person with the ability to program the brain.  First, in a very short period of time it is possible to find out so much information that it would not be possible to learn and learn in a lifetime.  And this information appears immediately, in its entirety, and at such an age that all life is still ahead in order for this information to be used.  Secondly, you can not learn anything, and immediately get all the skills at once, while expanding the functionality of the subconscious.  As well as changing the privacy of the functions of the subconscious, you can get access to low-level functions, which would allow the consciousness to affect any part of the functioning of the body.  Remove fear, pain, regulate temperature, metabolism, and more.  This could get rid of the need to take medicine and be treated only by conscious effort.  The result is a person who immediately knows and is able to do everything that the mankind knew and skillfully before him.  Of course, a lot of questions immediately arise here, and then will not all people be the same, with the same set of knowledge and skills.  It is unlikely, because with this approach, consciousness - the dynamic program of each person, will also remain different.  And everyone will be free to dispose of data and skills as he wants in his dynamic program.  Another question - from what age you can begin to program the brain, so that it does not have a tremendous impact on the personality of the person.  The answer to it can only give practice. <br><br>  As a result of the development of such an approach to knowledge, the level of education of people will increase thousands of times.  And at a young age, people will know everything.  They can work anyone they want.  This will allow more flexible allocation of human resources, and increase productivity.  Scientists will have such a complete amount of information that it will allow you to look at things from different angles and see the complete picture.  As there are hundreds of thousands of people who can see the full picture, the likelihood of new discoveries will increase proportionally.  As a result, it will give a tremendous impetus to the development of science.  Why is it difficult to make discoveries in some areas?  Because some areas are borderline.  That is, they combine several sciences at once.  To figure out how to program the brain, you need to be both a doctor and a programmer.  Essentially incompatible professions, but their symbiosis can develop into unique discoveries.  With the development of science, most professions will become unnecessary.  Routine work will be performed by robots.  And man will only have a creative component. <br><br>  As a consequence of all the above, there will be a leap in the development of society.  Completely change the way of life.  All life and all work will go into the field of thought.  And here are several options for the final: <br><br>  <b>First:</b> Humanity is evolving, and will move to a stage where the physical component will play a small role.  And the mental component will be man.  And humanity will be alone with a big mind, rapidly exchanging information and developing new knowledge. <br><br>  <b>Second:</b> As usual, there is a bad ending.  There is a theory that civilizations, reaching a certain level of their development, disappear.  This can happen for 2 reasons.  Either knowledge and technology are not high enough to withstand that which can destroy this civilization.  Or, on the contrary, knowledge and technology have reached such a level that their use for destructive purposes can destroy the entire civilization.  Even now, the level of human development is in such a state that it is suitable for the first case (example: the sun will explode, and we cannot do anything to escape), and for the second case (there will be enough nuclear weapons to destroy our civilization several times ). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140666/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140666/</a></p>
