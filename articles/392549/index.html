He spent 167 days in orbit, of which 20 hours in open space, and among the crew of the Soyuz for the first time flew by the ‚Äúshort circuit‚Äù from Baikonur to the ISS in 6 hours.  But its uniqueness is not in this, but in the fact that even two years after the flight, he does not have the title of "cosmonaut-pilot".  He is a pilot - flying over a thousand hours.  He is an astronaut.  But not a space pilot.  And not a hero, although after the first flight now all astronauts receive the Golden Star.  They just forgot about him. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  About the almost detective story of how the star bypassed the hero <a href="http://novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/mag/2016/2528/30551/">told on the site</a> "News of cosmonautics."  The situation is strange: it seems that all interested participants of the award are in the know about the situation, and no one is against it.  Alexander did not beat the muzzles to the commander of the Star Troop platoon, did not brawl on the night streets of Star City, and did not bathe in the fountains on Cosmonautics Day.  However, all submissions to the award were inevitably lost in the depths of a multistage bureaucratic machine.  Initially, some objective reasons for the delay were: according to the traffic police, their crew in orbit exceeded the first space and was fined. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Quote on Cosmonautics News</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  About six months later, that is, in the spring of 2014, the personnel officers of the CPC and RSC Energia finally prepared a single crew presentation for the awards: Sasha Misurkin - for the title of Hero of the Russian Federation, <a href="http://zelenyikot.com/talkingwithspaceman/">Pavel Vinogradov</a> - for the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, III degree - and according to the accepted procedure, they were sent for approval to the administration of the Moscow region.

      By the end of the summer, this performance returned to the personnel department of Energia for the reason that P.V. Vinogradov showed an unpaid penalty for speeding in June 2013 (Pavel was in space at that time and flew at a speed of almost 8 km / Has the traffic police started placing radars in orbit?) The case was delayed.  In order not to delay the awarding of Misurkin, the personnel officers, at the request of Pavel Vladimirovich, made separate submissions on each of them, and the documents of Misurkin were again sent to the regional administration.  Vinogradov, in order to get the business off the ground, had to pay a fine and write a ‚Äúacquittal‚Äù letter addressed to the governor of the region A. Yu. Vorobyov with a promise to correct himself and never again ‚Äúto violate‚Äù. <br></div></div><br><br>  But later no intelligible explanations of the award ignore were received.  Most likely, the situation was aggravated by the <a href="http://zelenyikot.com/roscosmos-dead/">reform of Roskosmos</a> : the creation of the space flight control system, the reincarnation of the Federal Space Agency into a state corporation.  And now, the necessary paper is on someone's desk under a pile of new documents or the previous owner of the cabinet did not have time to sign, and the official who passed it did not begin to understand the old papers.  In general, anything can happen.  And in the current situation, we can either be indignant at the indifference of the bureaucracy, or do something about it. <br><br>  I propose to sign an <a href="https://www.change.org/p/%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258E-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2583-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D1%2583-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%258E-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%258F">online letter to the new head of Roskosmos</a> .  I do not know whether there will be any effect, sometimes <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/179217/">petitions work</a> , sometimes not.  We can at least try by expressing our respect for the astronaut at the same time, without waiting for official ceremonies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a7/bba/004/6a7bba004b4a0015e1278920087b4cbc.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392549/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392549/</a></p>
