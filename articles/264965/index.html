Then you have a chance to use it in the fall!  Now, when you buy an HP ProLiant server (a list of models under the cat in the spoiler) based on Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 series processors, you will receive an additional lifetime license for the <a href="http://www8.hp.com/ru/ru/products/server-software/product-detail.html%3Foid%3D5294347">HP iLO Essentials</a> management tool with 1 or 3 year support period.
