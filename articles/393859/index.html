They forever lost access to their tanks, gold and crews. <br><br>  The province of the players is that they built their tanks in the form of a swastika and published a screenshot.  The unfortunate joke was negatively perceived by other gamers and turned into sanctions by the administration. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The screenshot with the construction was <a href="https://new.vk.com/wall-115671917_895">published</a> on May 9 in the group "Vkontakte" with the signature "All with the day of victory!".  The authors of the performance were so brave that they didn‚Äôt even hide the nicknames.

      The WoT administration reported that the players violated clause 4.3.19 of the <a href="http://worldoftanks.ru/ru/content/docs/user_agreement/">User Agreement</a> , according to which the game is strictly forbidden to propagandize and demonstrate Nazi, extremist or other similar attributes or symbols. <br><br>  Judging by the color of the tanks in the screenshot, these are pumped players with a large number of exclusive equipment and cool statistics, so the deprivation of property will most likely become a serious loss for them. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>From Wikipedia:</b> <br>  Swastika (symbol "Âçê" or "Âçç", Sk. From ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø, svasti - greeting, wish good luck, prosperity, from ‡§∏‡•Å, su - "good, good" and ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø, asti - "is, to be" - a cross with curved at right angles to the ends (‚Äúrotating‚Äù). There are opinions that its meaning depends on the direction of ‚Äúrotation‚Äù of the swastika. <br><br>  The swastika is one of the most ancient and widespread graphic symbols, which was depicted by many nations of the world on everyday items, clothing, coins, vases, weapons, banners and emblems, in the design of churches and houses.  The character occurs from 8 thousand years BC.  Oe., presumably crystallized from rhombo-meander ornament, first appeared in the late Paleolithic. <br><br>  The swastika, as a symbol, has many meanings; among the ancient peoples, it was a symbol of movement, life, the Sun, light, and well-being, and is capable of symbolizing philosophical categories. <br><br>  In the 20th century, the swastika gained fame as a symbol of Nazism and in Hitler Germany and in the Western world it became firmly associated with the Hitler regime and ideology. </blockquote><br>  The WoT administration has already distributed permobans many times for the demonstration of the swastika, so this is not the first time, although it may be the most massive ban of players for a similar offense. <br><br>  One of the WoT moderators told Geektimes on the terms of confidentiality that ‚Äúeven in players' nicknames, Nazi-associated nicknames, slogans, abbreviations and everything related to them are forbidden;  dude with the nickname zigazaga easily falls under the propaganda clause and flies to the ban. ‚Äù  He also explained that the usual Bundeswehr crosses in the game are allowed, because the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2586">Balkenkreuz</a> (beam cross) is the Wehrmacht identification mark, it was used as a symbol on the recognition of ‚Äúfriend or foe‚Äù and is still used. <br><br><hr><br>  UPD.  For a legal assessment of the actions of the players of the MERCY clan, an <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275658/">application is being prepared to the prosecutor's office</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393859/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393859/</a></p>
