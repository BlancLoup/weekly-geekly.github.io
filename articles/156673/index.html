In 99% of cases, the "clickers" are made by Cherry, and they are put not only into pathos ergonomic models, but also into fully combat "game" devices.  In the end, gamers are also people, and they also want high-quality input.  Especially in difficult conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ca/972/a5c/2ca972a5ce954ce37df341fcba561d01.jpg"><br><br>  There are not so many mechanical keyboards on the market - Cherry by themselves (try to find, yeah), DasKeyboard (on request), a couple of models from Razer, SteelSeries had some, from CoolerMaster and from Tt eSPORTS, actually.  BlackWidow <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/142875/">surveyed</a> in Habr√© uv.  Tov.  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/flagman/" class="user_link">Flagman</a> , well, and my new acquaintances got me a rare thing - a white mechanic from the e-sports division Thermaltake.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The keyboard comes in an inconspicuous black box of a completely normal quality, so there is simply nothing to photograph there.  And since I already had a ‚ÄúBlack Widow‚Äù, it‚Äôs just not going to knock the two titans together with their foreheads, especially since the standoff is still in color. <br><br>  <b>Theorem</b> <br>  The first, and perhaps the most important difference between the two keyboards - the "clickers."  Those notorious things that are responsible, in fact, for the very pressing of the button.  In the "widow" (and in many other keyboards) one of the most popular models, the so-called "blue" series, is used. <br>  It looks like a ‚Äúmechanic‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2bf/dfa/794/2bfdfa794176a8c163243854e5adc939.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  It is the "falling" white shit that makes the keyboard click nobly.  The noise from the fast print is colossal.  For games, such switches are suitable, but not perfect.  The point is that the point at which the key begins to work "reverse" (the point to which the next drowning of the key down will not be considered a new press, but will be considered as holding the previous one) is slightly higher than the point at which the key is recorded . <br>  For clarity, please pay attention to the following diagram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/23d/e8d/bf9/23de8dbf90dd5106983ba63e52ed0f0d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A quick double-click is possible, but difficult. <br>  In Meka, the switches of the ‚Äúblack‚Äù series are used (identical to red, only the effort differs, so for clarity I will use a picture with a red clicker).  The mechanics of the work are as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65f/31e/a1a/65f31ea1a2f86fa55d9413c154416837.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The cap, falling down at the "blue" ruler here is attached tightly.  The force of such a key is almost uniform throughout the entire stroke length (the absence of a ‚Äúhump‚Äù on the part that enters the metal ‚Äúeye‚Äù is responsible for this), and the pressure is recorded at the same moment as the key triggers the reverse and the electronics understand that the button They were released at that very moment, as the threshold value of the pressure returned to the point at which the ‚Äúclick‚Äù was recorded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bda/408/d7e/bda408d7e8e30debc046bf0e9d2a3b41.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, theoretically, the black ‚Äúclicker‚Äù is slightly more adapted to the games than the ‚Äúblue‚Äù one, and slightly different in sensations ‚Äúunder the fingers‚Äù. <br><br>  In practice, the differences are striking.  First, the keyboard behaves much quieter.  Noble mechanical "grumbling" when printing has not gone away, but there are no high and distinct clicks in sight.  The keystroke effort increases smoothly, and their ‚Äúthreshold sensitivity‚Äù allows you to type at a relaxed pace, just touching the keys, and frantically pressing on with a hundred buttons, scribbling at the speed of a good machine gun. <br><br>  <b>Appearance and equipment</b> <br>  In the box, in addition to the white beauty, there is: a stand under the wrists, drivers (again a disk, useless, in my opinion, junk), a bag with something inside.  A detachable USB cable is stored in it (in the bag), which, depending on the location of things on the table and the type of monitor, can be plugged in and out to the right, or (after moving under the keyboard) to the left.  In the same BlackWidow, the cable is two times thicker, attached ‚Äútightly‚Äù, and contains at the end two USB ‚Äútails‚Äù and two 3.5 mm connectors for audio accessories (in the case of the Ultimate version). <br><br>  The body is made of soft-touch white matte plastic.  Start, no matter how surprisingly it sounds, I want from the bottom of the keyboard. <br><br>  The body is riddled with stiffeners, all bolts are covered with special seals, and the bottom is studded with pads with a rubber surface - the keyboard is as secure as the mausoleum on the red square, and does not move until you <s>want the bulldozers to</s> do so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a0/2a5/833/2a02a583302184dac0f2d42c317f6f25.jpg"><br><br>  Well, if you are accustomed to using the keyboard "with a lift" - you can fold two "legs", on the edges of which rubber spacers are also applied.  The tilt angle will noticeably change, and the stability on the table will not change a jot.  The keyboard is reliably protected from slipping on any surface, and for a well-thought-out solution it receives an honest 10 points. <br><br>  On the ‚Äúrear panel‚Äù where the USB cable is connected, there are two more USB outputs (not requiring a separate USB slot from your computer, unlike the ‚ÄúWidow‚Äù), microphone input and headphone output.  Nothing ordinary, but we will return to this place.  The cable, by the way, is easy to transfer from the ‚Äúleft‚Äù side to the right side, if you are not satisfied with something by default. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d2/ef4/85e/2d2ef485ed628411dc38bfab00be6377.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Layout and buttons</b> <br>  Now - the most delicious layout.  To be honest, the keyboard is very difficult to call small.  In addition to non-acidic side ‚Äúfields‚Äù on each side, the size of the keys is also slightly wider than that of the BlackWidow.  In addition, the keyboard is awarded with a scattering of extra keys.  A macro block, unlike Razer products, contains not five, but as many as twelve macro buttons: two rows of six each.  Above the Escape key there are three buttons for profiles and a "game mode" button, which includes additional macros that can be hung on any text key, and the Win button off (click on it causes the "response" of the Ctrl key). <br><br>  In the right part above the Num-block are the multimedia keys responsible for playing music and the volume of the device + backlight button. <br><br>  All of the above benefits in the form of dedicated buttons on the "widow" are caused by a combination of FN + F1 ... F12, which, admittedly, is much less convenient. <br><br>  The layout itself is ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù, the enter is L-shaped (fu-fu, I don't like it), the backslash treacherously lurked in front of the right cipher.  On the left - everything is human, in front of the cipher nobody has added extra buttons, the spacebar is of normal width and is not framed by any idiocy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02e/d34/04a/02ed3404a31d28aaa03038975623ad26.jpg"><br><br>  Regarding the layout of the printed block, unfortunately, I like the ‚ÄúWidow‚Äù more (by the way, we say hello to the guys from Razer for their curve layout on Anansi).  I got a ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù keyboard for the test in the ‚Äútournament‚Äù version, the Russian characters were not printed on the keys.  In principle, the blind seal has never failed, so I had no problems with the recruitment of this review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b9d/400/35a/b9d40035ad8e0a7c759bda71da185590.jpg"><br><br>  But ‚ÄúTournament‚Äù is in a reduced backlight - only the arrow keys are illuminated, the WASD block, the Tt, Caps, Num and Scroll-lock logo (a great solution, much better than the indistinct and dim indicators of the Widow), yes, that's all.  The backlight has three levels (33, 66 and 100% + pulsating mode).  Naturally, no one forbids you to turn it off at all.  They promised to show the full dummy version a little later, I am glad that the company took care of the ‚Äúmere mortals‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/51e/70a/aa6/51e70aaa65014e597c795ac942356486.jpg"><br><br>  Let us proceed directly to the sensations from work (since I told about the mechanics at the very beginning, and the whole appearance has already been described). <br><br>  <b>Sound, camera, motor</b> <br>  Well, firstly, the keyboard is not silent, but at times quieter the ‚Äúblue‚Äù ‚ÄúBlack Widow‚Äù.  At least my woman no longer curses when I type something at night. <br>  Keystroke - sure, the trigger point feels pretty good, but there is no pronounced non-linearity of the stroke.  The force grows evenly a little over the entire 4 mm stroke of the key, and all the buttons are pressed confidently and easily. <br><br>  A macro block is a miracle, conveniently divided into three groups of four keys (squares), easy to grope blindly and an excellent ‚Äúmind map‚Äù.  I have the main part of the photoshop tools in one of the profiles there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/db6/06e/b55/db606eb55eeba3ddfb795fa42ac5dc17.jpg"><br><br>  All the big keys also do not cause complaints - they are supported in the right places and do their job perfectly, do not bend, do not stagger, and generally can‚Äôt complain about quality. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt like the order of the buttons above the digital block.  The current order is ‚ÄúVolume Up‚Äù, ‚ÄúVolume Down‚Äù, ‚ÄúVolume to Zero‚Äù, ‚ÄúBacklight‚Äù.  In Europe and Russia, they read from left to right, so that instead of increasing the volume, I often found myself in ‚Äúmute‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/04f/06a/bc4/04f06abc49d8813033e4d023db124b31.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Nice bonus</b> <br>  And now the part for attentive readers.  As you remember, the keyboard is connected via a single USB cable, and contains additional USB ports and audio input / audio output.  Since nothing happened when the speakers, the headset and the microphone were connected to the keyboard, the very first thought was ‚Äúfor sure, I didn‚Äôt connect the audio cable‚Äù.  But in the box it is not!  And connect something like nowhere.  And then it dawns on me - but what if ... with the right button on the "sound" in the tray, the playback device ... and here it turns out, the sound card is built into the keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d0/083/2e4/9d00832e47bd9672ce2dfab1472a0818.png"><br><br>  A very, very good solution, a minimum of wires, a maximum of utility facilities, and even a USB hub has not gone anywhere.  In addition, the sound for such a solution turned out to be quite pleasant, not zvukovuha for 200 bucks, of course, but anything better than the built-in motherboard, and even more so built-in most laptops and monoblocks.  Additional advantages to developers for such a solution. <br><br>  <b>Summing up?</b> <br>  So let's start with the positives: <br><ul><li>  Build quality; </li><li>  Materials; </li><li>  Bottom structure; </li><li>  Execution of "clickers" and buttons; </li><li>  One cable; </li><li>  Built-in sound card with good performance; </li><li>  Convenient and reliable wrist stand; </li><li>  Cable Management </li></ul><br>  Not without drawbacks: <br><ul><li>  Limited number of profiles; </li><li>  Limited software; </li><li>  The order of the keys responsible for the volume; </li><li>  Heavy drivers. </li></ul><br>  The remaining ‚Äúminuses‚Äù are subjective, so they fall into the ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù category: <br><ul><li>  Keyboard layout: Shift, Backslash and Enter (subjectivity); </li><li>  Illumination (waiting for the version with a fully highlighted "canvas"); </li><li>  White - gets dirty (wash your hands, yeah); </li><li>  Price (for a good thing and pay is not a pity, good, and ask not so much - about 150 evergreens). </li></ul><br>  In general, I really liked Tt eSPORTS Meka G-Unit.  Comfortable, reliable, beautiful and unusual, it attracts views (and even dust and prints, if your hands are not washed!), It is perfectly ‚Äúunder the fingers‚Äù and performs its functions.  The built-in sound card easily surpasses the tweeters built into the motherboards, and the USB hub allows you to plug in a USB flash drive or card reader without breaking through to the back of the system unit and without getting under the table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/119/367/8af/1193678af43fb820cd8eeff2cc6e83e6.jpg"><br><br>  There are plenty of advantages to ‚ÄúMeki‚Äù, minuses from the point of view of software are reparable, and controversial points are controversial to be hotly discussed in the comments, because truth is born in a dispute.  <b>Fight!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156673/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156673/</a></p>
