And some of the facts will surely surprise readers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Countless reports, reviews and research, as one, testify: the eLearning industry is not one iota slowing down in its rapid development.

      In 2015, the global eLearning market is expected to reach a total of $ 107 billion. Total sales in the asynchronous learning segment (self-paced learning) in 2010 reached $ 32,100 million, and over the past five years the average annual growth rate in this area amounted to about 9.2%.  This means that in 2015 an estimated self-paced learning sales on the global eLearning market will be $ 49,900 million. [3] <br><br>  For reference: self-paced learning is a type of e-learning in which students, independently of the teacher, choose the time and pace of the educational process convenient for them. <br><br> <a href="http://infogr.am/mirovoi_rinok_elearning"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/620/c1a/9ee/620c1a9eeced47d998e29511f0523060.png"></a> <br><br>  <font color="009900">‚ñåRating of 10 countries by market growth rate</font> <br><br>  The growth rate of the eLearning market is an important indicator that demonstrates how intensively the market is developing in a particular country.  Based on the growth rate, it is possible to calculate the approximate profit, which is fundamentally important for investors that they are willing to invest in foreign e-learning projects. <br><br>  So, in which countries eLearning can be produced most profitably?  Look at the schedule. <br><br> <a href="http://infogr.am/reiting_10_stran_po_tempu_rosta"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2d/3cf/257/f2d3cf257d7746dda9dd4ae2b56d05fb.png"></a> <br><br>  The first two places, as we see, were divided almost equally between India and China, which is quite expected - these three billion hard workers, making economic leaps in the development of a global scale, are in dire need of education.  Moreover, it is desirable - the most inexpensive and accessible to everyone, which is eLearning.  Malaysia is not far behind, and these three ‚ÄúAsian tigers‚Äù of our days can be very attractive to investors in e-learning with their growth rates from 41 to 55%! <br><br>  The United States, the United Kingdom and the rest of Central Europe are absent in the rankings, which raises the question: did the first surge in popularization of distance education take place here, or do the population of these countries simply need less eLearning? <br><br>  Finally, the absence of Russia is depressing.  Of course, it is not so pleasant that Russia is absent from this top-list, but our country's inclination for a long time to harness probably also manifests itself here, which we wrote about in detail in a <a href="http://teachbase.ru/blog/elearning/">previous publication</a> . <br><br>  <font color="009900"> Learning Management Systems Market - LMS</font> <br><br>  The global market for the Learning Management System in 2013 was $ 2,550 million, and the cumulative annual growth rate reached approximately 25.2%.  In other words, it is expected that the total volume of the global LMS market will be about $ 4 billion in 2015 and more than $ 7 billion in 2018. <br><br>  It is also assumed that the largest share of revenues from this amount will be the volume of the North American LMS market. <br><br> <a href="http://infogr.am/rinok_sistem_upravleniya_obucheniem_lms"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e7/2de/8ba/3e72de8baa73480a8c3e0b532b7bf197.png"></a> <br><br>  <font color="009900">Mobile learning market</font> <br><br>  The global market for mobile-based educational services reached $ 5.3 billion in 2012.  Experts have calculated that the average annual growth rate in the market should be 18.2% by 2017. <br><br>  The global volume of Mobile-Learning in 2015 will reach $ 8.7 billion, market researchers predict, and in 2017 will amount to $ 12.2 billion. It is noteworthy that in 2012 the top list of countries in the number of users of gadgets and mobile learning was headed by the USA , Japan, South Korea, China and India.  By 2017, this rating will be headed by China, USA, Indonesia, India and Brazil, experts say. <br><br> <a href="http://infogr.am/10_svezhih_faktov_ob_elearning_kotorie__vi_dolzhni_znat"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d8/25f/1c2/6d825f1c2eb24394a7b505d2fd45c71c.png"></a> <br><br>  <font color="009900">‚ñåMOOCs in corporate training</font> <br><br>  Currently, 8% of all companies in the world successfully use <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD-%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%2581">Massive open online courses</a> - MOOCs.  Another 7% of enterprises are considering the experimental introduction of MOOCs.  According to experts, in the next couple of years, these figures will increase to 28%. <br><br> <a href="http://infogr.am/copy_copy-7802101"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cad/000/ea0/cad000ea0dbc472fb481e2c3ce38aa49.png"></a> <br><br>  Examples of successful use of MOOCs: <br><br>  - More than 350 companies in the world collaborate with the most popular platforms MOOCs - Coursera and Udacity.  At the same time, the main goal of such companies is to identify the best students during the training process in order to select the best candidates for their positions. <br><br>  - Google Inc. credited 80,000 of its employees to the HTML5 course, implemented on the Udacity platform. [7] <br><br>  ________ <br><br>  [7] Putting MOOCs to Work Recap Infographic <a href="http://extensionengine.com/putting-moocs-to-work-recap-infographic/">extensionengine.com/putting-moocs-to-work-recap-infographic/#.VKqE9iuUeKs</a> <br><br>  <font color="009900">‚ñåCorporate eLearning</font> <br><br>  The market for cooperative online learning is expected to grow significantly by 2017.  Experts predict that it will increase annually by 13% during this period. <br><br> <a href="http://infogr.am/copy_copy_copy-38"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/606/914/de7/606914de73ca4694bafc687f20248c44.png"></a> <br><br>  <font color="009900">‚ñåMain eLearning audience</font> <br><br>  Despite the fact that eLearning is used by companies of different sizes, the main buyers of eLearning products and services are large companies. <br><br> <a href="http://infogr.am/copy_copy_copy-611"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87c/725/c26/87c725c264f54450a39bee680be47761.png"></a> <br><br>  <font color="009900">Corporate training methods</font> <br><br>  At the end of 2014, corporate training methods were as follows: <br><br> <a href="http://infogr.am/copy_copy-3783072"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7aa/de0/63e/7aade063e33c4cc6b5c56d90c18876e0.png"></a> <br><br>  The real indicators shown in the graph for 2013, the projected results for 2015 are quite contradictory in the overall picture.  However, obviously, the most intensive growth of popularity among other methods of corporate training experts predict education through social networks.  Indeed: people are now getting to know each other, having fun, working, arguing, reconciling, feuding through social networks, etc.  So why not leverage these flexible corporate learning platforms? <br><br>  <font color="009900">Technology training</font> <br><br>  Last year, companies around the world used the following corporate training technologies - in descending order of popularity of technology types. <br><br> <a href="http://infogr.am/copy_copy-4569619"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b00/e36/a9b/b00e36a9bbb44cc5bee6beb7bae06cd4.png"></a> <br><br>  <font color="009900">‚ñåWorld demand for software and services in the field of corporate education</font> <br><br>  The following chart shows exactly which products or services they intend to acquire in 2015, companies of the most varied scales for the purpose of corporate training for their employees.  (according to the testimony of the 2014 report): <br><br> <a href="http://infogr.am/copy_copy_copy-914"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/460/8fa/952/4608fa95237749f284563b114b5e2a2e.png"></a> <br><br>  These data eloquently show: the corporate e-learning market currently has a huge potential for profit.  Now, more than ever, companies and students themselves turn to eLearning to achieve their personal and professional goals.  And 2015 promises that there will be even more students in this market than in previous years. <br><br>  <i>Especially for you we collected the facts in</i> <br> <a href="http://teachbase.ru/landing/%3Futm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_content%3DPost_247454"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b54/c26/9b1/b54c269b17a34122ba31a7f80eadd238.PNG"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374779/</a></p>
