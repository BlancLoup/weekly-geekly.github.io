Supercell CEO Ilkka Paananen (Ilkka Paananen) said that $ 400 million was spent on promoting games last year.

      It is noteworthy that analysts were expecting more from Supercell: Superdata estimated the company's revenue in excess of $ 1.8 billion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Apple removes antiviruses from the store </h3><br>  Following the news apps from the App Store <a href="http://apptractor.ru/deploy/app-stores/apple-nachala-udalyat-antivirusyi-iz-app-store.html">, antiviruses also began to disappear</a> .  According to the developers, Apple has a rather banal argument: ‚Äúincorrect description‚Äù, although even after all the revisions, applications are not returned. <br><br>  In fact, antiviruses are removed simply for the fact that, according to Apple, there can be no viruses on iOS, which means that such applications are not needed, as they mislead users or hint at possible iOS vulnerabilities. <br><br>  VirusBarrier, like some other antiviruses created for scanning mail or apple repositories, which follows from their description, was removed from the store, and it is not yet clear whether they will return back and under what conditions. <br><br><br><h3>  Android as wii </h3><br>  Ingenious guesses are usually quite simple and, once voiced, seem obvious.  One can only wonder: ‚ÄúAnd why didn‚Äôt they do it before?‚Äù It was about the <a href="http://app2top.ru/games-2/rolocule-games-predlagaet-wii-opy-t-v-ramkah-e-kosistemy-android-53006.html">way</a> the creators of the game Motion Tennis Cast did it.  They used a bunch of smartphones on the android and the Chromecast media server as a wii prefix.  Excellent and completely logical move, the performance of the selected devices has long allowed to do such things. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/b-VfK2nd7P4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLzDnNRUFr6-KLLQJXeKRV0_aLHQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Judging by the video, the game turns out pretty straightforward, but this is only the beginning!  We will wait for a surge of similar games and lawsuits from Nintendo :) <br><br><br><h3>  Apple represses application reviews </h3><br>  Recently <a href="http://apptractor.ru/deploy/app-stores/applifto-i-iguides-udalili-iz-app-store.html">,</a> Russian news apps <a href="http://apptractor.ru/deploy/app-stores/applifto-i-iguides-udalili-iz-app-store.html">have been removed</a> from the App Store that tell about mobile technologies and innovations: iGuides and AppLifto.  The main reason in both cases was the violation of Apple‚Äôs paragraphs 2.25 and 2.26: the promotion of third-party programs. <br><br>  But it is important to note that AppLifto and iGuides abused keyword spam in the title, posted content on competing mobile platforms. <br>  Yes, there are other similar applications to which Apple does not apply such actions, for example: AppleInsider. <br><br><br><h3>  IPad share in Russia fell by half </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f9/fc6/c83/0f9fc6c839ed44679b45deb35ca5f0ff.jpg"><br><br>  According to a <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2015/03/ipad-double-fail/%3Ffrom%3Drss">study by</a> J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, in Russia, more and more preferences are given to Android tablets.  So, in 2014, their market share rose to 89%, while the iPad share almost halved and dropped to 10%. <br><br>  It is important to note that over the past two years, the average selling price of tablets has almost halved, which is below 10 thousand rubles.  In this case, the highest sales growth, almost doubled, was shown by the price category of tablets up to 5 thousand rubles.  This is reflected in the difficult financial situation in the country, and the constant increase in prices for Apple devices during 2014. <br><br>  At the same time, the world share of the iPad fluctuates slightly, and according to the results of 2014, it was 28%, and Android tablets did not exceed 68%. <br><br><br><h3>  Glu will release the game with the Kardashian sisters </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdb/db8/e57/bdbdb8e57d0048108b673698ecb29d0f.jpg"><br><br>  Not so long ago, we already mentioned that the glory of Kim Kardashian deprived many of sleep and appetite.  Our list has been replenished, this time the sisters Kim Kendall and Kylie Jenner <a href="http://app2top.ru/games-2/glu-anonsirovala-igru-s-sestrami-kim-kardash-yan-52917.html">got</a> in the <a href="http://app2top.ru/games-2/glu-anonsirovala-igru-s-sestrami-kim-kardash-yan-52917.html">queue</a> (If I correctly understood Wikipedia, then they are even relatives). <br><br>  This, of course, was irony, and the sisters did not get up anywhere, and Glu Mobile is to blame for everything, which, in the wake of success, decided to tightly take over the celebrity games market and stood in line with it.  The tactics are quite successful and have been repeatedly tested by different companies - we occupy the market with one game, and the lives of competitors (and they are!) Become noticeably more difficult. <br><br>  In case the Kardashian brand has already exhausted itself, Glu has a solution - playing with singer Katy Perry.  Hopefully, Glu also has a solution in case the ‚Äúcelebrity games‚Äù genre has exhausted itself. <br><br><br>  ************************************************** ************************************************** ***************************************** <br>  If you liked the material and you had time to evaluate the professionalism of the authors of this blog - there is an opportunity to join them.
