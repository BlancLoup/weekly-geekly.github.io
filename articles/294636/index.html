On Thursday, September 17, the appellate court of the federal district in Washington made a decision.  Apple now has the right to interdict certain features of Samsung devices. <br><br>  Even the fact that the South Korean firm was supported by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC">HTC</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Electronics">LG Electronics</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rackspace">Rackspace Hosting</a> did not affect the court‚Äôs decision. <a name="habracut"></a>  They believe that Apple‚Äôs victory will allow patent holders to ‚Äúunjustly use their patent to gain a competitive advantage,‚Äù <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-17/apple-wins-ruling-that-could-force-samsung-to-change-products">reports</a> Bloomberg. <br><br>  In 2011, Apple accused Samsung of copying the manufacturing technology and design of the iPhone smartphone.  Apple CEO Tim Cook backed up the charges with relevant patents.

      Among them is the unlocking of the screen from the movement of a finger on it - slide to unlock.  In addition, the list of stolen technology includes a patent for a data detection system, such as a phone number in the address book when entering similar numbers, as well as automatic correction of the spelling of words on smartphones. <br><br>  In 2012, Samsung was ordered to pay a compensation of a billion dollars.  After the first appeal filed by the company, it was decided to reduce the compensation to $ 930 million. <br><br>  On May 18, 2015, a US court reviewed the dispute between Apple and Samsung in 2012.  According to the court, such details of the appearance of the smartphone, as a rectangular shape, rounded corners, black edging and a smooth transparent surface, are not the subject of a patent dispute.  Therefore, the amount of compensation that Samsung was supposed to pay decreased by $ 382 million. <br><br>  Apple claimed in court that Samsung irreparably suffered from violations, having damaged its reputation as an innovator, losing market share and noting a decline in sales. <br><br>  Failure in court complements the already sad position of Samsung.  Profit continues to fall due to weak smartphone sales.  In April-June 2015, Samsung‚Äôs net profit was about $ 5 billion, which is 8% less than a year earlier.  The company's profit falls for five consecutive quarters.  Operating income on an annualized basis decreased by 4% to 5.9 billion, and sales - by 7% to $ 41.6 billion. <br><br>  In April-June 2015, Samsung‚Äôs share of the global smartphone market declined by more than 3 percentage points due to growing iPhone sales and strong competition from Chinese brands such as Xiaomi. <br><br>  The company made a bid for the new smartphone Galaxy S6.  But this decision was erroneous: it could not stand the competition with the iPhone 6. However, the Galaxy S6 Edge model with a rounded display turned out to be in demand.  However, the manufacturer did not release it in sufficient quantities and, despite a large percentage of sales, the share of the Galaxy S6 Edge in the total revenue was very modest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294636/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294636/</a></p>
