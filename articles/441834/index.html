  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do not hire. And what if it is you?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Job search forums are full of messages: ‚ÄúI have been looking for work for half a year / year and recruiters have refused me, because nonprofessional people think that since no one has taken it, we don‚Äôt need it either.‚Äù  Familiar?  Let's figure it out. <br><br>  First, the recruiter is usually a little bit able to distinguish the emotions of people and has some sort of experience in assessing.  At least 5-7 people pass through it on a daily basis with whom he communicates in detail.  Common traits and behavior in this case is not so difficult to identify.  (And professional recruiters see and analyze much more and can make up your overall psychological portrait in an hour productively with you). <br><br>  Secondly, your personality traits are just as important as professional ones, and they are half the success of the interview.  How do most candidates look for a long time and unsuccessfully looking for a job?  Embittered, depressed, tired.  Would you like such a colleague?  Me not.  The interview is a sale, the recruiter sells you the opportunity to work in the company, you - your expertise.  No matter how great a professional you are, you probably will not be taken: it‚Äôs not obvious, you always communicate with people like that or only today. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Imagine you need to buy paper in the office.  A gloomy man comes to you, looks at you scornfully, answers all your questions: ‚ÄúLook at the price list, everything is written there!‚Äù.  It seems that the paper is good and the prices are good, but I don‚Äôt want to cooperate somehow.  And after him comes a cheerful and cheerful person, jokes, answers your questions, tells the pros of their products.  Maybe his paper is a little grayer, but he agrees with that, made a discount to you and says that in 3 months it will improve production.  There is a difference?  How can business benefit?  Indeed, in the first case, we could get better quality paper for less money!  With long-term cooperation, we are waiting for not only the product itself, but also the service.  For example, they will call and remind us to order paper that is almost over, or they will notify about discounts, or they will deliver an emergency shipment when we really need it.  Will the first seller do this?  Maybe it will, but looking at his behavior, we assume that no.  It is difficult and difficult for us to communicate with him now, it will also be difficult in the future.  Also, from the employee, we expect normal communication with colleagues, teamwork and much more.  This is no less important than knowledge of English or blind typing.

      ‚ÄúHRs are easy to say, and where are we going to get positive?‚Äù I was in that situation.  It so happened that I left with a very good at that time work and returned to Moscow after 2 years of life in another city.  The crowded labor market, the fear of self-praise and presentation, and the lack of work have done their job.  Someone told me about regional experience, someone offered wages half the size of the previous one, my eyes were rounded off even more and I could no longer adequately think.  I would have refused myself on the spot recruiters (they did).  A sober look at myself helped me, at some point I realized that the fear of failing the interview is so great that there is no longer any chance of passing it. <br><br>  I think this is important, to understand that the problem is in you, in your attitude and presentation.  When you understand a problem, there are many methods to solve it.  The method of the worst scenario helps me, what will happen if everything goes wrong: I‚Äôll be blacklisted by this company and never call again.  When you realize that tragedy will not happen, life becomes easier.  Preparation for interviews works perfectly: to write out all possible questions, to structure and think over answers will help you to feel prepared and confident.  Another option for those who, like me, is complex without work - freelancing or my own projects.  You are not idle, you are doing what you have dreamed of!  Here, even a few advantages, you will have something to tell at the interview, and you will be distracted by something other than job search.  Obsessive thoughts exhaust morally and will not bring anything good.  Job search, of course, is also a job, but not 24/7. <br><br>  Selling himself is also a skill, he needs to learn and constantly train.  There are people who do this well, such candidates easily go through all the stages of selection, but if this is their only merit, they don‚Äôt linger in companies for a long time.  On the other hand, there are a huge number of professionals who receive income that is much smaller than the market or even out of work because of isolation and asociality.  Everywhere you need a balance: without self-presentation skills you will not get into a company where you can express yourself, but without professionalism, a successful interview is a deception that will be revealed when solving the first serious task. <br><br>  Develop versatile, fight with your complexes and grow above you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441834/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441834/</a></p>
