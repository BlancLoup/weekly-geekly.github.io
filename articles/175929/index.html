And sometimes 100. <br>  To these amounts seem ridiculous, pass by. <br>  And who knows the price of every dollar earned - please continue. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Application names </h4><br>  App name.  I didn‚Äôt really believe that the number of downloads depends on the icon or name.  On the first point, I remain in the same faith, but by the names of my opinion has changed. <br>  Yes, names matter and here are two examples, free and paid. <br><br><h4>  Case one </h4>  Judge for yourself.  I had a free application Three-dimensional Tetris.  Based on BlockOut.  The counterparts existing in the App Store categorically did not satisfy me with the method of controlling poison colors. <br>  A year ago, I made my own application and uploaded it to the store under a colorless name.  Downloads - 1000 per year. <br>  At the end of last year, I released exactly the same with the new name <i>Pentis</i> .  Downloads - up to 1000 per day, for some reason, mainly China. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      There are still few people <i>playing Pentis</i> (because the gameplay is complicated) and the number of downloads is due to the name change.  It is consonant with the shameful male body.  Single letter difference. <br><br><h4>  Case two </h4>  In January I released the paid app <i>Biathlon 2013</i> .  The purpose of the application is a shooting simulator, as in a real biathlon. <br>  As you know, the entire winter the elite of the world biathlon chases the World Cup stages.  And fans watch them personally or on TV.  So after each race, 5-20 people download the application.  Depending on the winner.  Most of all swing the Vikings and Germans. <br><br>  Important!  For Europeans, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much the app costs if it costs less than a cup of morning coffee. <br><br>  I changed the cost of the application from 2 to 7 dollars.  If the price of the application is above $ 5, the number of daily downloads is zero. <br>  As a result, I left the price at $ 5, sometimes I give a discount of up to 3, and over the winter I received $ 1,000 in profits. <br><br>  I believe that I received this 1000 dollars only on the title, because there was no goal to earn, but the goal was to use the new BlueTooth 4.0.  Application development time is less than 2 days. <br><br>  And yes, the name <i>Biathlon 2014</i> I took.  From this expensive name I will receive in the Olympic year the amount of the order of $ 5,000.  Already a lot, yes, lovers of expensive cars? <br><br><h4>  How did iAd help me? </h4>  I have a <i>Six Towers</i> app.  Pleasant, it is played 5000 unicum a day. <br>  It brings 50 dollars in iAd and 10 dollars in AdMob, divide the income in half with the publisher. <br>  And so, on February 2 of this year, Apple's advertising turned to zero.  The day is zero, the second is zero, the third is zero.  Well, I think it fails, it happens.  At the same time, AdMob has grown to 80-100 dollars.  What the hell.  After 3 weeks, Admob revenue dropped to $ 40 and stabilized.  iAd still did not bring anything.  The publisher to my question said that he did not understand what was the matter - the fall in all applications, not just mine. <br><br>  I had to dig a little deeper and it turned out that the Apple system had failed and the publisher was not renewed a certificate for using iAd. <br>  As a result of the negotiations, Apple fixed the error, and the income from iAd took off to $ 200 a day.  And the income from Google has stabilized in the previous 10. <br><br>  After 4-5 days, everything returned to normal.  50 from Apple, 10 from Google.  Are you laughing? <br><br>  This means that in your game the same people bring less income as old-timers. <br>  And if you programmatically switch ads every 2 weeks from iAd to adMob and vice versa, users of 3-5 days are considered to be new and viewing them advertising brings you 30-100 percent more money. <br><br><h4>  The third tip is to save money / time </h4>  Do not waste your energy on reviews on resources like iphones.ru.  In addition to the waves of hatred from the editors and useless time spent (or money) - you will not get anything.  Although it is all very humorous. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I hope my humble experience will help you in the glorious business of developing applications for iOs.  Heil Jobs! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175929/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175929/</a></p>
