We believe that e-books are not a device for geeks, so in a series of publications we want to offer examples of how e-books can improve people's lives. <br><br>  Now we are going to talk about students, because soon September 1, who will continue to study, and who will go to the audience for the first time.  Studios do not want to carry with them weight, so textbooks are not included in the student's set.  But textbooks should always be at hand.  And if the textbook is one for the whole course?  Or not everyone has?  Or is there not enough for everyone in the library?  How can I solve the problem?

    <a name="habracut"></a>  This solution is proposed: <br>  a) the group throws off on the textbook; <br>  b) they are found in some service, or they buy a document scanner (second-hand so that it is not expensive); <br>  c) the back of the book on the book press knife is cut off, a whole block of pages is obtained - though the textbook will suffer, but what can't you do for the sake of science! <br>  d) we put all this pile of the received sheets in the scanner and it scans 20, or 40 pages per minute.  With a special program, it sticks together a book either on 1 page, or 2 pages in PDF or DJVU (Lbook V60, by the way, reads DJVU and PDF perfectly). <br><br>  And Wellcome!  Everyone uploads a file to their e-books - and that's it, the whole group has a tutorial. <br><br>  It may seem too troublesome and expensive.  But if everyone in the group buys a textbook?  - will be more expensive.  Moreover, there are many textbooks, and even more textbooks and manuals.  If everyone will scan a textbook for themselves - the time is enormous, and the savings are substantial.  (And if you scan the synopsis and in JPEG in an e-book? :) <br><br><img src="http://www.scansol.ru/img/XEROX_DocuMate_162.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This document scanner can scan a book in a few minutes. <br><br>  Still it is necessary to say about one advantage of the electronic library for a better process of self-education.  As the author of ‚ÄúPostpsychological Autodidactics‚Äù aptly noted, the translator from more than 50 languages, Valery Kurinsky, that we are more interested in learning when we distract ourselves from the main thing, and then come back to this main thing.  And it is important that the main subject of study is always at hand.  It is, as often happens: five minutes to six I wanted to read a story, and at six I already want to read something about programming.  In the electronic book is placed the entire library.  And now - 5 minutes I read the story, 5 minutes I read something about programming, and 5 minutes I read Pelevin, as a result I do not get tired because of the constant change of classes.  Well, if you don't want to read anything at all, I can go to the post office or the Internet.  As a result, being distracted, I will always return to the main point, to the story, for example, or to something else. <br><br>  So, thanks to the e-book, students do not need to ‚Äúpick up the heavy‚Äù and the process of (self) education can be improved - and no ‚Äúmaterial resistance‚Äù.  Have a good study, dare, sleep! <br><br>  You can suggest your own use of e-books in camments. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125652/</a></p>
