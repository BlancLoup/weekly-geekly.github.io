  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In the third quarter of 2006, there was less spam, but more scams</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the third quarter of 2006, there was a decrease in the amount of spam in mail traffic, states <a href="http://www.kaspersky.ru/">Kaspersky Lab</a> .  Since the end of August, the share of junk mail has fluctuated at the level of 70-80%, whereas in the first half of the year this figure reached 90% (on average - 80%).  Anna Vlasova from “Laboratories” indicates several possible factors that triggered this process. <br><br>  So, probably, the law “On advertising” could affect the reduction in the share of spam in the third quarter of this year, namely, a number of amendments to the law that came into force.  The researchers do not claim that the connection between these phenomena is direct, but they admit that it is not just a result of coincidence, since spam has “fallen” mostly in the segment of product advertising in Russian.  That is, there may be a reaction of a small business (the main customer of spam advertising) to a change in legislation.  “On the other hand,” adds Vlasova, “the decline can be explained by quite prosaic reasons: during the August holiday season, customers find advertising campaigns unprofitable and are waiting for autumn.” <br><br>  The drop in the share of spam also correlates with changes in its thematic composition - the number of offers of spam services itself (mailing services) has increased.  Kaspersky Lab concludes that at the end of the summer, spammers are actively looking for new customers.  In the texts of their messages, they are trying to prove to potential customers that the entry into force of the amendments to the law "On Advertising" will not affect the spam industry.  "Spamming does not threaten you with anything," they assure.  According to the researchers, if such self-promotion takes effect, then the reduction in the proportion of spam in the mail traffic of Runet will be short-lived.

      As already <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1179/">reported by</a> “Habrahabr”, in the third quarter of 2006 there was a sharp increase in messages on the subject “Personal Finance”.  Thus, the top four thematic categories were: <i>“Medicines, goods and services for health”</i> (19%), <i>“Computer fraud”</i> (12.4%), <i>“Educational services”</i> (10.8%), <i>“Personal finance”</i> ( 10.8%).  At the same time, criminalization of spam is growing.  It is noted that fraudulent messages are present in spam of any category, especially in “Medicines” and “Personal Finance”. <br><br>  “Medicines and health products imposed on users are often counterfeit,” says Anna Vlasova.  She adds that it is also possible that manufacturers and sellers are not licensed to manufacture and distribute these products.  “It also happens that under the high-sounding name of the drug, biologically active supplements are actually sold.  Perhaps they do not require licensing, but the reliability of information about their medicinal properties is questionable. ” <br><br>  Thematic category “Personal Finance” in the third quarter turned out to be represented by almost the same type of spam: this is an animated graphic “junk” with English-language offers to buy other stocks.  These proposals are also questionable from the point of view of the law, since they are attempts to cause artificial demand for the shares of some companies.  Many of the Western Internet users have seen from their own experience that the acquisition of such shares is a waste of money. <br><br>  According to Kaspersky Lab, Russian consumers are not too interested in spam offers for securities: “Obviously, this is due to the fact that we do not have many users who are actively playing on the stock exchange and are interested in stocks.  But this does not mean that spammers will not find other options for cheating users.  Actually, they are already actively looking for ways to withdraw money from other people's pockets, which can be used in Runet. ” </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4672/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4672/</a></p>
