  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do you have a lot of money? Stop being snobs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the last two days, Habr was flooded with the next outraged posts about the level of claims and expectations.  They go there, they say, everyone, they know nothing, they want millions. <br><br>  All I want to say about this - stop.  Just stop.  All this looks like an attempt to assert itself, pouring on others. <br><br>  If a person came to you with a complaint twice as much as he answered your questions, this does not mean that he is a search designer and a crook, or knows nothing.  It also suffers from the effect of Dunning-Kruger, about which I have heard for the third time in a month. <br>  It is possible that he just does not suit you.  It is possible that he gets his money for a good reason at his current job, just his field of activity does not coincide a bit with your requirement.  And you will not be able to understand this in an hour of the interview.

      Perhaps you yourself have not been looking for a job for too long and have forgotten how it happens. <br><br>  I was looking for a job.  And he came to the interview in mail.ru, for example.  Yes, in the end they did not take me and, probably, just laughed at themselves (although it was unlikely the guys were very positive) - came here with complaints, but he himself was in general!  Maybe a crushing article could write. <br>  But there are many factors that influence how you show yourself at the interview.  Everything can simply do not add up.  Of course, I myself then laughed to myself how I was stupid, and I had brilliant answers to the questions I was asked.  Then.  And then to the question ‚Äúwrite a program in any programming language that finds prime numbers from 1 to a million,‚Äù you, like me, write it in three lines by enumeration.  And then the question ‚Äúaccelerate it twice‚Äù will, like me, recall the course of higher mathematics, wrinkle your forehead and mumble that you do not quite remember the search algorithm for prime numbers.  About the fact that you can simply throw out even numbers from the search, you will remember only in the evening.  A recruiter will sit and sigh to himself.  And then the article will write about the level of claims. <br>  There were a lot of interesting and funny moments later.  And they offered me in the end a salary in half of what I asked, obviously just to get rid of.  Show, so to speak, your place. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But you know what?  A year later, I was interviewed for a similar post at Cisco Systems.  In English.  In three stages.  Not in the Russian office.  Well, with a salary, yes. <br>  And Cisco Systems imported me into the European office.  It is foolish, probably, to blame them for not understanding who they hire and generally taking everyone in a row.  It‚Äôs just that everything went better on their interviews.  So it happened.  Hardly my level so dramatically increased over the year. <br><br>  So stop being a snob.  People are different.  But at least half of those who came to you and asked for ‚Äúhuge money for nothing,‚Äù just went in the wrong door this time.  Do not be obscene.  You then started all this to find someone who is right for you.  And do not figure out how many people do not suit you. <br><br>  PS And here's another funny case, well, it's from very young.  About 6 years ago I went to an interview where a sweater admin drove a whole department to watch how he would butcher me with questions and made me compile the Linux kernel from the sources.  And then half an hour humiliated by every inaccuracy that I made in the settings make menuconfig.  Something that did not include RTC without which SMP will not work effectively, and so on with explanations as it should.  Before five or six, I did not even understand who ‚Äî decent men in shirts and ties.  They just sat silently and looked at him like a god.  And he sat all surrounded by servers assembled from ordinary computers on self-made shelves, of course, with Linux on them and broadcast.  The interview was in his place for the post of administrator in a small journal of the type of one that is thrown into boxes with advertising.  In the office of 20 people to support the mail server and Internet access.  More they had nothing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285544/</a></p>
