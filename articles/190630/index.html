The total term of the project is 45 days and the minimum amount at which we will receive the money is 380.000 p. <br><br>  10 days after launch, the project collected 100% of the amount claimed.  All this money came from more than 440 sponsors.  The only thing we can say is stunned!  We did not expect such rapid progress.

      The main flagship for this was, of course, habraeffekt.  Replenishment for the first day after the publication of the post on Habr√© - about 120 thousand, for 3 days our piggy bank has replenished almost 200 thousand rubles.  Is it possible to say that all this is the effect of Habr?  "The wind of change" (who needs it, the pun will understand;) with Habra inflated the sails of our project.  And the ship "Simple Science" rushed into the distance, ahead of all imaginable terms.  In general, habravchane!  Thank you sincerely! <br><br>  But the post, in fact, is not quite about that.  One of the interesting notes, as we work on the project, for us were the results of our survey on Vkontakte, or more precisely: its financial results. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Obviously: the success of the project is connected with the preparation - monitoring, making friends, forming a base of loyal clients or consumers.  And this is probably the strongest place in our strategy.  And not because we managed to somehow get ready in a special way.  Just our online channel " <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GTVscience">EASY SCIENCE</a> " for more than a year.  Gigabytes of captured information, countless hours of preparation, shooting and editing.  All this resulted in more than 200 videos with fascinating experiences of varying degrees of complexity, 50 thousand YouTube subscribers, 20 thousand members of the VKontakte group, a certain prominence on Habr√©.  In general, the loyal consumers, who are impressed us, were already before we conceived the release of the book.  It remains only to understand - how loyal are they to us?  How could this be done?  We decided to conduct a survey in our group in Vkontakte and on Habr√©.  But on Habr√© anonymous survey, but VKontakte - no.  And this is the most interesting in our study. <br><h5>  Poll with Habra </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83c/452/d32/83c452d329e991686dca096a0c1cc792.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Vkontakte survey results can be seen <a href="http://vk.com/simplescience%3Fw%3Dwall-40520383_3552">here</a> .  The question was: ‚ÄúAre you ready to participate in the publication of the book?‚Äù It was suggested to choose one of the answer options - from third-party observation to specific material assistance.  For us, the project organizers, it is desirable that the option with a specific amount be chosen.  But more importantly - to vote was fair.  And absolutely important - to open.  Because your humble servant had to contact EVERY participant in the voting, who promised to provide material assistance in the survey.  The results of communication, by the way, deserve a separate post.  But I will try to explain them here. <br><br>  Then I began to contact with each participant of the voting, I went on the scale from bottom to top, starting with the option ‚Äú3000 rubles‚Äù.  Why?  Because, as you already know, money goes to money.  The less time it takes for you to collect a solid part, the easier it will be later.  The question is what a ‚Äúsolid part‚Äù is, what is it measured in, in rubles or in sponsors?  Good question and I have no answer.  I can say something else: ‚ÄúBumstarter‚Äù promised us to the Vesti.ru project partners if we manage to collect 50% of the amount in a week.  But we were not taken to "Vesti", because, in their opinion, we will put everything together.  Offended by the denial of information support with this wording, you see, not with your hands. <br><br>  Let's go back to the survey.  At the top, you can see how% were distributed to each of the survey options.  Below, I will write how many people answered the call for help in individual messages and how much they contributed.  Of course, there was a certain amount of misunderstanding.  Moreover, their frequency has a certain regularity - the greatest number of people were observed in slyness among those who voted for ‚Äú3000 thousand rubles‚Äù, fewer - where ‚Äú1000 rubles‚Äù.  And in the ‚Äú500 rubles‚Äù option, the percentage of communication is worse than in the case of ‚Äú1000 rubles‚Äù.  It is important to understand - if 10 people say that they are ready to help you for 3000 rubles, this does not mean that you will have 30 thousand rubles.  Here is a completely different math.  And you need to be ready for such answers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf8/afa/9f3/bf8afa9f3abbb4049152fe286f7c7320.jpg" alt="image"><br>  or <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b7/f65/b31/9b7f65b3197f586290f45e22674cce15.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And to such: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40b/9bf/ef6/40b9bfef600db0c3e9ff8db9032446e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And even to such: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d31/6b1/a5d/d316b1a5d412a50fb2f7ddd7e89e1af2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, be prepared for the fact that schoolchildren will suspect you of deadly sins and threaten to complain to your parents.  If you do not fall behind. <br><br>  A lot of time and moral strength is spent on all these correspondences.  For the day, you can write only 20 new contacts for you (restriction VK).  And you need to write so that, first, to get an answer (at least some!) - this will mean the presence of communication.  Secondly, ask for help repost and money.  What kind of wording is needed?  Personally, I felt it in the tone of the interlocutor's answer.  And if in the case of the first message I made myself a template in which I changed names, then further - only an individual approach. <br><br>  So, at the time of writing of this text in categories, we have the following options on the scale of "promised-answered-helped": <br><ul><li>  Of the <b>38 people</b> who voted that they would give 3000 rubles: 6 people (15.8%) made contact, three (7.9%) really helped (the sum is 11,000 rubles); </li><li>  Of the <b>21 people</b> who voted that they would give 1000 rubles: 12 people (57.1%) went to the contact, seven (33%) really helped (the amount was 9,600); </li><li>  Of the <b>53</b> people who promised p. 500: 21 people (39.6%) made contact, 13 (24.5%) really helped (amount - 8000); </li><li>  Of the <b>98 people</b> who promised p. 300: 36 people (36.7%) made contact, 14 people (14.3%) really helped (the amount is 5,300). </li></ul><br>  <b>Total - 33900r.</b>  only from users of this survey. <br><br>  Separately, I emphasize that the sponsor does not always transfer the amount for which he voted.  Deviations happen in both directions! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9e/02c/660/b9e02c6602c5c56f7913ea78d99d3dd4.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f58/8bc/3a5/f588bc3a51812cf6f5aa9f2f524c7645.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, what conclusions can we draw from our experience?  The best percentage of communication with those who voted for 1000 rubles.  The worst - those who voted for 3000 rubles.  Despite this, the contribution of each group has a clear pattern - the most significant from the most "richest" answer option, and the least - from the most "modest" one. <br><br>  This work brought us 33,900 rubles out of the required 380,000 - that's just 8.9%!  Where did we get the rest? <br><br>  This is a topic for a separate post, but looking ahead, I will say that we divided all the work and all 44 days into parts and called them "circles."  There were six of them.  Each of them has a different number of days, its own audience and its own actions, which we planned and are planning to do.  At the time of writing this post, we have already started the fourth round.  But in more detail it makes sense to tell about them already at the end of the project. <br><br>  In the following posts I will continue to describe interesting comments on the development of the project. <br><br><h5>  Second volume </h5><br>  The phenomenal support of the first volume of the book ‚ÄúSimple Science‚Äù was a pleasant surprise for us - for 10 out of 45 days the amount was fully collected.  This finally convinced us that today children's scientific literature is more in demand than ever.  And that we are submitting interesting material in a convenient form for the reader and viewer.  That is why we decided not to stop the current fund-raising project, but to continue it - for the release of the second, third and, what is already there, the fourth volume. <br><br>  Content of the following books: <br><h6>  Second book </h6><ul><li>  household chemistry; </li><li>  experiments with density; </li><li>  Atmosphere pressure; </li><li>  unusual paints. </li></ul><br><br><h6>  Third book </h6><ul><li>  electricity; </li><li>  experiences with sound; </li><li>  experiments with a magnet; </li><li>  optical experiences. </li></ul><br><br>  In the fourth experiment will be even more interesting: fire, driving force, the weather and something else;) <br><br>  More detailed content of the second volume, as well as examples of video experiments that will be included in it, we have placed on the <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/projects/53053/kniga_dlya_detey_prostaya_nauka">project</a> page on a boomstarter. <br><br><h5>  Dilemma </h5><br>  To be honest, we are in some confusion.  On the one hand, the money collected, the project is successful.  On the other hand, we are already in the process of working on the second book, and we were offered to launch it as a logical continuation of the project on a boomer.  If we refuse to participate, we will miss the possibility of financing (and this is our first attempt to monetize the project from the beginning of its launch).  We will agree (and we have almost agreed, even made an update to the project) - we can seem grabbers to our viewers and sponsors who have already supported the project. <br><br>  Once again, we decided to resort to a survey.  Please express your opinion on our "problem": </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190630/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190630/</a></p>
