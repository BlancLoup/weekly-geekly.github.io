On October 27, the 4th International Conference of Mobile Developers <a href="https://mbltdev.ru/ru%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Dpostrelease">MBLTdev 2017 was held</a> . <br><br>  25 speakers from <b>Google</b> , <b>Uber</b> , <b>Avito</b> , <b>Fyusion</b> , <b>Sharewire</b> , <b>Tinkoff</b> , <b>PSPDFKit</b> , <b>Agoda</b> , <b>Sberbank</b> and other companies made presentations on the latest trends in mobile development and shared their own experiences and practices.  The main topics of the conference were speed and application support, AR-interaction, Core ML, animation, Audio Unit Extension, organization of teamwork and much more.  As it was - read under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This year, MBLTdev gathered more than 600 participants: iOS and Android developers, testers, analysts, mobile development project managers and other representatives of the professional community.  The program was held in 4 streams in the formats of reports, quizzes and Codelabs.

    <h2>  main hall </h2><br>  <b>Zac Sweers</b> - Android developer <b>Uber</b> from San Francisco opened the program in the Main Hall.  Zac explained how the Uber team uses code generation to troubleshoot and boilerplate code.  Considered the possibilities of automation, examples of libraries and other chips. <br><br>  In addition to working at <b>Fyusion,</b> iOS developer <b>Luke Parham</b> writes tutorials for <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/">raywenderlich.com</a> .  In his report, Luke spoke about various tricks and approaches to optimize and increase the speed of mobile application performance.  Figured out how to notice Dropped Frames and learned tools like Time Profiler, Core Animation and Activity Trace. <br><br>  Developer <b>Ivan ≈†koriƒá</b> , <b>PSPDFKit</b> , gave a talk on Android animation on Kotlin using RXJava2.  On the creation of the Core Data stack with an extensible model told <br>  <b>Vladimir Ozerov</b> and <b>Alexey Ulenkov</b> from <b>Sberbank</b> .  Together with <b>Alexander Tolstoy</b> from the Dutch company <b>ShareWire, they</b> discussed tools and approaches to increase the quality of development with minimal effort. <br><br>  The final report in the Main Hall was made by <b>Alex Curylo</b> , <b>Agoda</b> .  His report was interactive: Alex went out to the hall to demonstrate the use of the Core Location to create AR interactions tied to real objects.  We also considered the use of technology to improve various areas of life: from retail to navigation in museums. <br><br>  In addition to the speakers' speeches, quizzes for Android developers from <b>e-Legion</b> and for iOS developers from <b>CocoaHeads</b> were also held in the Main Hall.  The winners received MBLTdev 2018 tickets, cool T-shirts, books from Ray Wenderlich, certificates from JetBrains and Skyeng. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/30/zk/pr/30zkprsrfzfdir3mofdeaoym0so.png"><br><br><h2>  Second hall </h2><br>  <b>Ilya Kulebyakin</b> from <b>e-Legion</b> told about Legacy code.  The report discussed life hacking approaches that save time and avoid turning the project into a source of pain and frustration.  From the experience of e-Legion dismantled the creation of mobile application architecture and building relationships in a team. <br><br>  Together with <b>Nikolay Nesterov</b> from <b>Avito, we</b> learned about the benefits of static analyzers and looked at how to reduce the amount of routine for code review using Android Lint and Android Studio. <br><br>  <b>Cyril Klebanov</b> , <b>Surf</b> , spoke about CoreML and its practical application.  For example, the application "Labyrinth" learned about the visual search device.  The application finds on the cover of any of the 180,000 books from the store database.  Also dealt with the architecture of mobile neural networks.  The topic turned out to be so interesting that after the talk in the discussion area, the conference participants discussed the possibilities of visual search and its use in mobile applications for about 20 minutes. <br><br>  <b>Danil Ternov</b> , Android developer of the <b>Wallet</b> mobile app, told about the custom Layout Manager for RecyclerView.  Understand the new Amber architecture, invented by <b>Nikita Arkhipov</b> and his colleagues from <b>Anvics</b> .  It is based on Redux and Elm using Rx.  The final report in the second hall was made by <b>Viktor Starikov</b> from <b>VoltMobi</b> .  Audio Unit Extension was discussed with him: the possibilities of this extension, the way of creation and use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4m/88/_k/4m88_k8ddfseq2hn9fdad7gjzoa.png"><br><br><h2>  Third hall </h2><br>  The program of the third hall was opened by <b>Makar Stetsenko</b> from <b>Silicon Valley Insight</b> .  We learned how to get started with GraphQL and its use in native applications written in Swift and Kotlin.  Afterwards, <b>Vladimir Tebloev</b> from <b>Sberbank</b> made a presentation on the DI framework for Android applications and the problems of code generation using the example of Dagger 2. <b>Kirill Bessonov</b> spoke about the architecture of the mobile operator application from the <b>Tinkoff</b> experience.  After lunch, the program was continued by <b>Dmitry Kuzmin</b> and <b>Lev Brooke</b> .  The guys from <b>Alfa-Bank</b> shared their personal experience in systematizing the process of creating, storing and re-using icons for iOS and Android platforms. <br><br>  <b>Zviad Kardava</b> from <b>Google</b> shared development details using a cross-platform UI framework, Flutter, presented on Google I / O in May 2017. This SDK is suitable for both iOS and Android, thereby minimizing the time spent on development.  Flutter also simplifies the interaction between developers and designers. <br><br>  Then <b>Ilya Linnik</b> , <b>Evotor</b> , <b>spoke</b> on the microservice architecture on a mobile device.  <b>Nikita Kleschin</b> and <b>Timur Nurov</b> from <b>Mail.ru Group</b> told about the components, functionality and development of the <b>Delivery Club</b> application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4x/ac/gu/4xacguxg3iyu8bn-7ne7faixnng.png"><br><br><h2>  Codelabs </h2><br>  This year, for the first time in MBLTdev history, Codelabs on iOS and Android development were organized.  <b>CocoaHeads</b> conducted four training sessions with practical tasks: <br><br><ol><li>  The solution of algorithmic problems using the standard SDK Foundation for Swift. </li><li>  Integration of approaches based on Optional, Guard Bool, Casting types, Reference &amp; Value types, Map &amp; Filter, Protocol extensions. </li><li>  Finding and correcting a logical error hidden in the code of the finished application. </li><li>  Search for the maximum number of security bugs in the prototype application. </li></ol><br>  Codevibs on Android-development spent <b>Zviad Kardava</b> .  Participants learned about the intricacies of working with Flutter and tried to write code on this framework. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kg/nu/vd/kgnuvd_otcnxawvcxblj5cg1fvg.png"><br><br><h2>  Networking </h2><br>  MBLTdev, as always, has become a networking platform.  In the special discussion areas, and simply in the conference halls, the participants communicated with the speakers. <br><br>  Partners of the conference <b>Mail.ru Group</b> , <b>Tinkoff</b> , <b>Alfa-Bank</b> , <b>Sberbank</b> , <b>Evotor</b> and <b>MIT</b> held quizzes and awarded the winners with cool gifts: sets from LEGO, folding bicycles, hoodies and T-shirts.  The participants also talked with the robot Alantima, tried on neural glass, competed with friends on the race track and took pictures with Scarlett Johansson. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kc/gy/73/kcgy73i3f9qt3uoisq6w1kz_x28.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/MBLTdev/photos/%3Fref%3Dpage_internal">Photos</a> from MBLTdev 2017 and speaker <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4MAbXGALiOlTWFOaWdaQTg3eFU%3Fusp%3Dsharing">presentations</a> .
