  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pre-premiere film "Jobs"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I will say right away.  I liked the movie.  I am a programmer who has been developing devices on microcontrollers from zero to a series for the fourth year and who does not worship the apple technique, but respects outstanding personalities. <br>  I watched the movie on Friday, September 13, as part of the St. Petersburg International Film Festival. <br>  Below I will try to tell you why you should watch (or for you it will be a reason not to watch) this film. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33f/105/7f3/33f1057f39358b4ec2654473f01ddfd1.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Devices </h5><br>  My heart rejoiced at such juicy and vivid pictures of the soldering Apple Computer 1. Actually, I don‚Äôt remember a single movie, after which I would like to return to the soldering table again and finish a couple of printed circuit boards.  In this film there is a description of the creation of a number of devices: this is Apple I, Apple II, Macintosh and Lisa.  If you have never read biography or the history of Apple (and I am one of them), then this film is for you, there really are a lot of interesting and informative moments in it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/033/d6e/6a6/033d6e6a6a2aa08e874fd1367f7bd1a7.jpg" alt="image">

    <h5>  Presentations </h5><br>  We all know that Apple is 90% of the presentations.  "I am glad to present you a new ....".  The film itself begins with the presentation of the iPod and this is not the only fiery speech from Steve that you have to hear.  Monologues on the presentations are great, they make you hold your breath and feel the internal tension of the air.  I really liked it.  In addition, there is one significant moment in the film when Jobs understands how to make a person wait for Apple II right at the presentation of the still fresh Apple I. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/faf/518/07d/faf51807d0ace09f0435c38eb55bf42d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Steve Jobs - Ashton Kutcher </h5><br>  The film does not occupy any of the parties of the militant camps.  He shows Steve as an outstanding personality with his talents and flaws.  This was a man who had his clear vision and who was able to infect people with this vision.  This is a man who knew how to count and knew how to sell.  At first, he infected his vision of Woz and his friends, and then the whole world.  The film perfectly shows the transformation of the young Steve from a half-hippie into a real stern businessman.  This is a film about a living person, not about an icon, and not about the devil. <br>  Ashton Kutcher is a great actor.  He has an unforgettable gait, manners, grimaces and facial expressions in this film.  He poured Jobs from his young photos.  In general, the casting is very good.  It is clear that it was difficult to find a man similar to Wozniak, but all the other actors are getting into 100 out of 100. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a1/e2e/4be/0a1e2e4beaee269414ca9119a2bbf146.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  I did not read books about Jobs, did not read the stories of the company and the biography of Wozniak, Jobs, Ivy and other giants of Apple.  Perhaps that is why I really liked this movie.  If something in it is not conveyed as it really was, believe me, everything on the screen looks as reasonable and believable as possible. <br>  The pre-premiere show was in English, so I could enjoy the original soundtrack.  I hope that at the box office the voice will not spoil this film. <br><br>  P.S.  The post I have turned out very short.  I did not want to spoil your impression of watching this movie.  If you have any questions about the film - please ask.  I will be happy to answer them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193846/</a></p>
