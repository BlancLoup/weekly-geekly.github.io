The only thing that pleased me was the souvenir cut glass with the inscription ‚ÄúThe Socializer‚Äù and the disc with the performance of Edward Jordan (April 2008, Moscow). <br><br>  Now the opening should begin (traditionally delayed), so for now everything is.  Keep track of who did not find the N-th sum.  By the way, it is still not clear why the price of CareerLab is higher than that of ProfyClub.  Let's leave aside eTarget - there the prices are determined by specificity. <br><br>  Yes, the work of girls with documents on registration (payment, travel allowance) is good.

      <em>update @ 11: 28</em> <br><br>  The Internet periodically falls off. <br><br>  <strong>Viral marketing from Goblin Gaga (Ruslan Pauscha)</strong> - hypergraphs, their analysis and the generation of contagious groups.  It is argued that with proper allocation of such groups, projects are practically independent of the type of content and the form of submission.  Pretty controversial, but apparently, people believe this guy) <br><br>  <em>update @ 11: 46</em> <br><br>  <strong>Social networks - Expirience without notes - Garev Vladimir, <a href="http://grape.ru/">grape.ru</a> )</strong> <br>  Lulz, memes, mephagi (they are evil clowns who love to fuck).  A lot of funny, lively and colorful about the Platypus, Medved as a political leader. <br><br>  Almost listened to an excerpt from Arabic vision (in Google ** yadi - ** yadi - the song passed porn traffic) - failed for technical reasons.  But the audience crawls under the chairs from a meeting with familiar images - for example, Putin and Cthulhu, flash mobs at Internet conferences and many other useful and fun.  Vladimir flies a plus sign - the audience is delighted! <br><br>  <em>update @ 12:30</em> <br><br>  <strong>New generation social networks and Internet business prospects - Igor Eidman</strong> <br><br>  Classification of social networks - quite academic.  The pinnacle of development is a mathematically calculated and proven self-organizing network.  Igor intends to use blogs as ‚Äúbricks‚Äù of such networks. <br><br>  The main idea is that every self-respecting respectable person should have a living resource that allows him to express himself, create an image for himself.  Self-realization and integration into society. <br><br>  The report also attempts to define web 3.0 - a network of people through all types of communication.  For me it is too early to talk about version 3.  "Web 2.0 first finish (s)?".  And I completely agree with this - a concept is too ephemeral.  Wait and see) <br><br>  <em>update @ 12: 55</em> <br><br>  The last report before lunch: <br><br>  <strong>Hidden Internet - Alexey Andreev (Webplanet)</strong> <br><br>  Questions of the shadow side of the Internet, denial of YAN, services, the economy of torrents.  The problems of intellectual property on the example of narod.ru and boom.ru, which have been reborn in ‚ÄúDisk‚Äù - a repository of user data, which are no longer the home page and are more difficult to index. <br><br>  The main trend of growing networks is user protection.  Facebook protects its users from Google Friends Connect, vspomni.ru struggles with crosses on vkontakte.ru - everyone tries to keep their data in themselves. <br><br>  Registration is becoming more complicated, the struggle with robots, forgery of personality, humanized recommendations is intensifying.  As examples, the VIP community hive5.ru, top4top, snob.ru, which are now losing the main goal and are mutated due to weak network selection and the lack of online credibility in Central Asia. <br><br>  I really liked the phrase about the VIP-networks: ‚ÄúIf you are a millionaire - what the hell are you?‚Äù. <br><br>  The long-suffering gathering of Internet professionals at ezhe.ru is mentioned - the speaker spells out the complete slaughter of corporate wars and trends towards the exploitation of the name. <br><br>  Web 3.0 is revealed as a giant graph of humanity, a one-time registration boom for all services.  This is contrary to existing relationships between closed communities.  This is the ‚Äúblue dream of marketers‚Äù.  Currently, with web 2.0 network marketing 1.0 due to the lack of marketers of the new mindset. <br><br>  From myself: the report turned out to be interesting, the audience is involved, some even forgot about lunch.  Well, I ran) <br><br>  <em>update @ 14: 10</em> <br><br>  <strong>When will start paying users of social networks - Anton Popov</strong> <br><br>  Accidentally got on this report.  It turned out - not in vain.  Very controversial point of view in particular on the homeless. <br><br>  It is proposed to create a closed community of homeless people who make money together.  Moreover, thematic areas, methods of work are divided between the participants, inside the community is transparent. <br><br>  And now why I disagree radically - no one will scorch the most profitable topics to others and will not limit themselves to communities, while at the same time taking on certain obligations.  I believe that the community of homeless people has already been formed, but it cannot be called a formed social network.  Nobody from the designated circle will ever strive to create such a network or join it, because where there is real money (I agree, there are often not so many of them, although some already buy apartments with Internet revenues), there will never be equality. <br><br>  You can not associate social networks and socialism. <br><br>  In general, the report leaves a feeling of deficiencies. <br><br>  <em>update @ 14: 55</em> <br><br>  So far, nothing interesting has happened. <br><br>  <strong>‚ÄúNon-standard advertising in new social services, using custom communication for brand promotion‚Äù performed by Korobeynikova Ksenia (Mail.ru).</strong> <br><br>  I can not say anything intelligible - I did not listen. <br><br>  <em><strong>Appeal to those who read and was on other reports - rate them in the comments.</strong></em>  <em><strong>Then we will have a more complete picture of the first CareerLab conference of this magnitude.</strong></em> <br><br>  <strong>"The organization of the work of virtual teams" - Ilya Antipov</strong> and associates, each of whom has a blog. <br><br>  This report is the closest to me, I stayed on it for 10 minutes - they explain on the scratchpad what refactoring is, code-review and other incomprehensible (?) Things.  It is not clear that the above refers directly to the formation and process of the virtual team.  The only thing that was possible to squeeze out the meaning is that people will roll each of their own blogs, combining them into a network and promoting it all in a bundle. <br><br>  <em><strong>If there is anyone who caught more sense - please correct, I will be grateful.</strong></em> <br><br>  <em>update @ 15: 25</em> <br><br>  <strong>A successful project is a user-oriented project - Pavel Konoplitsky (UsabilityLab)</strong> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe market forgives the pioneers‚Äù - no matter how convenient the interface of your service to users is, if it is the first of its kind.  Odnoklassnki are traditionally cited as an example, which is not beautiful on the part of the speaker.  Perhaps such a dislike has prehistory? <br><br>  From the outside, the report seems to be rather convoluted, but as a result of the questions, it turned out that the speaker poorly links the concepts of ‚Äúusability‚Äù and ‚Äúmonetization‚Äù.  According to Pavel‚Äôs answers, it was clear that ‚Äúfirst of all, the user‚Äù, but the question arises: forgive me, but what for us is just a user if we don‚Äôt receive money from him? <br><br>  In the responses, I expected to hear at least the word ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù, but I did not wait for it ... <br><br>  Overall, the report made a negative impression. <br><br>  <em>update @ 16:20</em> <br><br>  <strong>How to send to 3 letters or practical experience working with API - Evgeny Rossinsky (NetStream)</strong> <br><br>  Explanatory report for strangers with 3 letters.  Methods of extending the service through the API and ‚Äútheir smaller brothers ‚Äî gadgets, widgets‚Äù are proposed. <br><br>  Problems of using the API listed by the presenter (very close to the text): <br><br>  - ‚Äúa third-party service has fallen off - your website is turning into a crap‚Äù; <br>  - ‚ÄúIf you allow outsourcers to your API, they will surely fail‚Äù - according to Murphy's law; <br>  - ‚ÄúThe API will have to be documented - and as fully as possible‚Äù; <br>  - ‚Äúfirewalls, proxies shut up services at the most unexpected moment, but the user is parallel that the problem is on his side‚Äù; <br>  ‚ÄúWhen changing the API, you need to manage not to break the products of partners built on it.‚Äù <br><br>  There are a lot of interesting things about JS services, mashups, cross platform based on Google Gears, Adobe Air, etc. <br><br>  Conclusion: API is a problem for the owner of the service, but without it in large high-load projects, nowhere.  As a result of working with partners, we get a lot of stress, but as the project grows, we will have to get used to it. <br><br>  You can not give the API full functionality - so as not to lose your own data.  Give limited functionality that allows you to build additional web applications based on it like Facebook.  Banal truth, but the report paid special attention to it. <br><br>  Overall, the report is good. <br><br>  <em><strong>Conclusions for the first day:</strong></em> <em><strong><br></strong></em>  <em><strong>food is great</strong></em> <em><strong><br></strong></em>  <em><strong>There are reports that listen to one pleasure</strong></em> <em><strong><br></strong></em>  <em><strong>speakers are surprisingly free to feel and feel free to speak colloquially))</strong></em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25913/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25913/</a></p>
