It was a logical idea to make ‚Äúfor yourself‚Äù a tool that would help in the routine administration as much as possible.  But before ‚Äúinventing a new bicycle‚Äù you need to decompose the problem that it will solve into its components. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is the actual problem? </h4><br>  <b>1. I / the client has only one server.</b>  <b>But in order to monitor it you need another one.</b> <br>  And who will monitor the server that monitors this server?  :) <br>  There is an exit!  Google will help you find a pack of bourgeois services.  Tried 15 pieces and did not find one <br>  which would work as we would like and had sufficient functionality.

      <b>2. In order to put the server on monitoring, it is necessary to register it at least in several configs.</b> <br>  In fact, it is not difficult to run vi config.cfg n times and download the software, but if you need to install or update the software, this creates an additional headache. <br><br>  <b>H. All tools in different interfaces.</b> <br>  I will give an example of the browser average administrator: <br>  The first tab is nagios, the second is cacti / mrtg.  Plus, to check the security is still some kind of software. <br>  These are three different interfaces, but they are connected by one entity. <br><br>  <b>4. I want to receive notifications through real SMS.</b> <br>  Operators mail gateways either often have a large delay or they simply do not exist. <br>  We must love to build relationships with operators.  Either screw the phone to the server, <br>  or work through which thread to the sms-cantor, having figured out its self-written API. <br><br>  <b>5. Forget <s>s</s> to conduct server security audits.</b> <br>  There are very few such web services and they do not always work efficiently. <br>  But there is a convenient and free nessus.  Although not automated without a normal web interface. <br><br><h4>  What Admin Want? </h4><br>  Based on their own experiences and desires, a list of functionality and features has appeared: <br><ul><li>  Simplify adding a server to the monitoring system.  It is enough to install from the ports of net-snmpd and with the mouse in putty to build the generated config. </li><li>  Inventory - A single place for storing information about what kind of system it is and what hardware it lives on. </li><li>  Monitoring the availability of services and metrics: HTTP, PING, SMTP, SSH, POP3, IMAP, DNS, CPU Usage, Disk Spae. </li><li>  Notifications by email, real (instant) sms, icq.  Daily summary report. </li><li>  Resource Usage Charts - Interface, CPU Usage, LoadAvarage, Memory, Disks </li><li>  Security - external server check for all known vulnerabilities - frontend for nessus </li></ul><br><h4>  Development. </h4><br>  There were no free hands for programmers, so I had to learn how to program and write myself. <br>  Java was chosen as the web-frontend as the ajax framework of ZKoss. <br>  AppServer - Tomcat.  Web bundle - Apache + Nginx. <br>  Backend - nagios, for rrdtool graphs, for security - nessus, everything is connected by ~ 20 demons and scripts in C, Shell / AWK, Python.  After 6 months, the world saw the alpha version. <br><br><h4>  What happened. </h4><br><br>  Monitoring: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b0/e70/cc6/6b0e70cc62e935c154b9b92094c85f61.png" alt="image"><br></a> <br><br>  Download schedules: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cda/453/61f/cda45361f9c5011d711882a057afc446.png" alt="image"><br></a> <br>  Security Interface: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/509/57a/737/50957a737e527ad9915934351bbd602d.png" alt="image"><br></a> <br>  Inventory: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b85/72a/19d/b8572a19d5ba4c95c4f3b06146ceb74a.png" alt="image"><br></a> <br><br>  You can kill the demo: <br><br>  user: demo@shalb.com <br>  password: shalb <br>  <a href="http://spae.shalb.com/">spae.shalb.com</a> <br><br>  Promo page: <a href="http://shalb.com/ru/spae/spae_features/">shalb.com/en/spae/spae_features</a> <br><br><h4>  Business. </h4><br>  Since it was just silly to spend so much time without the option to earn, registration was added <br>  and billing.  We made an analysis of prices for at least some similar projects (mon.itor.us, host-tracker), calculated the cost price of the service for monitoring one server, built a pricing policy and released $ 5 a month for monitoring one IP. <br><br><h4>  Who is a customer </h4><br>  SPAE's target clients are the owners, administrators of servers, VPS, which have from one to five servers. <br>  We do not focus on Guru administrators and administrators of large server systems.  These people have everything for a long time. <br>  The service simply solves some of the problems associated with the administration and security of servers. <br><br><h4>  The present. </h4><br>  Now the system monitors 80 servers in 5 data centers. <br>  An affiliate program was launched with Volya data center, which gives a 20% discount on our service. <br>  We started refactoring the code with real Java programmers.  We catch bugs, we plan a marketing campaign. <br><br><h4>  Future: </h4><br>  Custom setting of service monitoring (by ports / advanced http monitoring) <br>  Custom OID for graphs (disk IO inclusive) <br>  Multilingual interface. <br>  My IPS - integration into the snort management and notification interface. <br>  WebServices API. <br>  OpenSource standalone version - as soon as the code is not ashamed to show the community. <br><br>  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83109/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83109/</a></p>
