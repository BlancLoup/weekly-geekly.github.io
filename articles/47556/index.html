Giving a fish you feed him for 1 day, and having taught him to fish for the rest of his life! <br></blockquote>  Therefore, we decided to help people who have already achieved success in their fields to share knowledge with others.

      <b>The essence of the project</b> <br>  Within the project there are 3 roles: guru (expert), questioner, partner.  Inquirers send messages to the gurus.  To send a message you need to pay the recipient.  It is clear that such logic will be used by those who need to communicate with this very guru.  And this is the essence of the project, which distinguishes it from free question-answer services.  Not every expert / star is willing to spend time answering questions for free. <br><br>  If the guru no longer needs money, then he can use the service for PR purposes, setting up a withdrawal of money to the account of any charitable foundation. <br><br>  Of course, the expert / guru can organize the collection of money and the answers to the questions himself, but he will have to somehow report first that the services are paid, then check whether the money has reached, etc.  etc.  - a lot of unnecessary actions. <br><br>  With the AskFor.Info service, everything is simpler - if the message has arrived, then it has already been paid for and you only need to read and / or reply to it in order to receive money. <br><br>  <b>Guru</b> <br>  For each guru, they create their own page on a third-level domain on which he can place information about himself, photos, and working conditions.  He can give out a link to this page to everyone without fear that he will be bombarded with messages of no value to him.  Each guru assigns prices for their services individually in the currency they prefer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75a/ad5/174/75aad5174318b1a4a538291fbf22896b.gif" align="right">  Near the guru, the authenticity of the identity of which is confirmed by the service, hangs the corresponding icon shown on the right. <br><br>  <b>Questioners</b> <br>  The questioner can send two types of messages to any guru: for reading and with a prepaid reply.  If the guru has not read or responded to the message within the period specified by the questioner, then the money is returned back.  For each answer given by the guru, the questioner can leave feedback, which affects the rating of the guru. <br><br>  The questioner can replenish his account through webmoney, SMS, terminals, Yandex-Money and other electronic currencies. <br><br>  <b>Business model</b> <br>  Since the logic of the service does not yet provide free services that imply good traffic generation, it was decided not to use the advertising model.  For each message that has been read or answered, the service charges a fee. <br><br>  <b>Marketing</b> <br>  For marketing purposes, we have made an affiliate program with an unlimited number of levels.  50% of service profit is allocated for partnership payments.  Any questioner or guru can also become a partner.  If someone started to get acquainted with the site from the page of the guru partner, then the corresponding partner will receive his share of the service commission from the operations of this user.  It turns out that the partner guru is doubly profitable to advertise your page - he not only advertises his services, but also receives affiliate deductions. <br><br>  <b>Potential</b> <br>  The engine is fully multilingual and multi-currency, data in the database is stored in UTF-8.  There are plans to seize the capitalist world after the technology has been sharpened on the Russian market :-) <br><br>  <b>Investments</b> <br>  This version (already working) is made for your money.  Further options are possible. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> On the main page only those catalog headings are shown in which there are people, therefore there are so few of them.  In your account there are tags to accurately indicate areas of knowledge. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47556/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47556/</a></p>
