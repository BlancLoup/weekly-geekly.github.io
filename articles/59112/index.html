It must have scratches! ‚Äù <br>  After receiving the machine from repair in a month and testing it at home, they saw that toner was spilled outside the printer and inside, which caused paper to become dirty when printing. <br>  So, when printing, extraneous mechanical sounds are heard (rattle, tapping), which were not available before delivery. <br>  Separately, I would like to note the unsatisfactory work of the service to inform customers.  When the printer was handed over for repair, we were told that it would be ready in 5 days.  When 10 days later we called the service center to inquire about readiness, we were told: ‚ÄúOh, really long!  I will remind the master about your printer. ‚Äù  In addition, several times the center staff hung up the phone instead of answering a question or even asking for a call back later.  It is impossible to explain this by breaking the connection, since  on the subsequent call, they themselves said: "He is not in place."  Is the lack of the right employee on the spot is the reason to hang up or say a word to the client?

      I would also like to know the differences between warranty service lasting 12 months and service lasting 36 months.  What does each of these services mean? <br>  Thanks for attention. </blockquote><br><br>  Here is the answer: <br><br><blockquote>  Dear Alexander G. <br><br>  Thank you for your letter. <br><br>  We express our sincere regret that the inconvenience has been related to the Samsung brand. <br><br>  Thank you for the information about the work of the service center "Pioneer Service".  It is certainly very useful for the company, transferred to the department for the development of the service network and will be taken into account when evaluating the activities of this service center. <br><br>  The period of repair of equipment in a service center may depend on the complexity of the malfunction that has occurred, the availability of necessary parts in the warehouse of the service center, the workload of the service organization with repairs of products of other brands, and other working moments.  Samsung Electronics is doing everything possible so that the time spent in the service center is reduced as much as possible. <br><br>  The term "full warranty" means the fulfillment of warranty obligations in full, as provided for by the current Law of the Russian Federation "On Protection of Consumer Rights".  The concept of ‚Äúfree service‚Äù means the free elimination of product defects arising due to reasons of a production nature (i.e., the consumer is free of charge for repairing the defect and used spare parts). <br><br>  If at the moment you have any complaints about the quality of the printer, we recommend that you contact your authorized service center again. <br><br>  We hope that in the future you will not have any difficulties and this situation will not happen again. <br></blockquote><br><br>  It seems to me or the quality of service is the same everywhere? <br>  Why manufacturers do not follow the maintenance of <b>their</b> equipment? <br><br>  I still have a monitor and a Samsung microwave oven at home - both are already in need of repair, but I won‚Äôt even try, just throw out this trash and buy something from another company where I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôm bringing it to the SC for repair ( it does not matter whether it is warranty or not) I will not need to monitor every step of the staff, call my SC for two or three weeks to find out how my equipment is doing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59112/</a></p>
