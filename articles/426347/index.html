      To collect data in this study, scientists conducted a survey of several thousand participants, used GPS-trackers and drones.  The simulation carried out in the specialized PULSE environment included the study and comparison of multiple scenarios of the dynamics of pedestrian traffic depending on the shape of the space. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4U9X9_3XoZo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Such models are used, for example, to minimize the time of evacuation and to increase the level of safety of participants in mass events.  By the way, this study of a group of scientists was <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326087242_The_Impact_of_Different_Obstacles_on_Crowd_Dynamics">published</a> in the Journal of Computational Science. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/it/news/7781/">Experience: how our graduate works on projects in three research groups</a> </h4><br>  One of the first projects of Valentin Melnikov, a graduate of ITMO University, is related to the problem of distribution of traffic flows during the blackout ‚Äî a one-time outage of urban infrastructure elements.  To solve this problem, Valentin analyzed the data obtained in the real case of a blackout in Amsterdam in 2015. <br><br>  This study was carried out in the framework of the joint program of the ITMO University and the University of Amsterdam.  It helped to identify the elements of the infrastructure that must be made completely autonomous (in this case traffic lights of the transport network were considered).  From the material you will learn about other research Valentin and his personal experience of parallel work on several scientific projects. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/it/news/7832/">Projects: how digitalization is changing the news industry</a> </h4><br>  This is a short story about recent events around the <a href="http://renoirproject.eu/">RENOIR</a> project.  The ITMO University, which joined it in June 2018, is one of the project partners. <br><br>  Other RENOIR partners include major media companies such as Bloomberg, universities, such as Stanford University and Warsaw University of Technology. <br><br>  The main objective of the project is to create a toolkit for media companies that could solve a whole range of problems: from dishonest copying of texts to classifying one‚Äôs own materials and creating ‚Äúevent registers‚Äù based on semantic analysis of news. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jm/ta/dw/jmtadwjqztc_xyqz3gtscfwyxt4.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9">Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hackny/5605013333/">hackNY</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA</a></font></sup> <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/it/news/7039/">Projects: ITMO University scientists presented modular data storage</a> </h4><br>  The Exarch repository was developed as a result of researching ways to optimize the time of receiving and processing large amounts of data using preliminary semantic analysis.  An example of a use case is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJMgNI3xRlKQ">simulation of weather conditions</a> within a decision support system.  The authors of the study, Denis Nasonov and Alexander Visheratin, representing <a href="http://hpc.ifmo.ru/">the High Performance Computing Department</a> , presented their work at the ICCBDC 2017 conference in London.  Previously, they compared Exarch with HDFS and Cassandra, having received "more than twice the reduction in load time and a multiple increase in data reading speed." <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/it/news/7343/">Experience: how to develop a 5G network - our graduate student in the project SILIKA</a> </h4><br>  This is an example of a case study from a successful research internship of one of our graduate students, Anton Gusarov, representing the Department of High Performance Computing ( <a href="http://hpc.ifmo.ru/">ERW</a> ). <br><br>  From this material, you will learn how, after completing the first year of study in a master's degree in the specialty ‚ÄúSupercomputer technologies in interdisciplinary research,‚Äù Anton received an invitation for an internship in Sweden on a Visby scholarship program. <br><br>  In addition, here you will find a brief explanation of the essence of the SILIKA project, aimed at creating a scientific base for 5G networks. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/it/news/7709/">Experience: Participants on the Computational Science Conference in Crete</a> </h4><br>  Following the link you will find a brief report on the seventh international conference of young scientists and computer modeling experts (YSC-2018).

The link is an adapted transcript of the main points of discussion about how the work and career of the scientists of the laboratory look like.  In addition, experts discuss existing problems in the field of Computer Science and offer options for possible solutions. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/it/news/7142/">Experience: who is a systems analyst and why is this work never boring?</a> </h4><br>  We understand, together with the graduates of the ITMO University and Peter-Service analysts Maria Tsvetkova and Ekaterina Ryseva, who tell what the system analyst has to deal with and explain the specifics of the profession.  In their interviews, they share their own work experience: from building communication between software customers and IT specialists to integrating software into customers' business processes. <br><br>  From this material you can learn how Maria and Catherine approached the choice of direction for study and made the decision to start a professional career in IT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rd/07/-_/rd07-_fa_d_ok_gc6-hwuwbd7pk.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9">Photo of <a href="https://flic.kr/p/8RZTfD">Fernando de Sousa</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA</a></font></sup> <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/it/news/7149/">Opinion: "You should not go into programming just because it is fashionable"</a> </h4><br>  Nikolay Filchenko, senior developer of the Yandex.Taxi service, a graduate and teacher of ITMO University, talks about a career in the IT industry.  In his column, he explains why and how professional design differs from student projects.  Nikolay assesses these issues from the point of view of his experience - in Yandex.Taxi he is implementing new product requirements and improving the efficiency of service algorithms, and at ITMO University he teaches C ++. <br><br>  This material will be interesting to those who are determined with the direction for development - whether it is studying at a university or the beginning of a professional career.  On the one hand, the author tries to warn beginners and make it clear that in any field of activity, creativity is limited to formal requirements.  On the other hand, he emphasizes the shortage of narrow-profile specialists and recommends that, as soon as possible, a decision be made on which area you would like to develop. <br><br>  <i>Our other habratopics:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/spbifmo/blog/334232/">Non-classical admission to university</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/spbifmo/blog/425249/">Introduction to LLP at ITMO University: the course "Low Level Programming"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/spbifmo/blog/354182/">How to start a career as a magistracy researcher at ITMO University</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426347/</a></p>
