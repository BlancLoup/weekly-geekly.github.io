In my humble opinion - this is one of the best games of now existing. <br>  It appeared a long time ago - in 1987, seven years after the release of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue">Roque</a> - the father of Nethaka and the founder of the genre of " <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">rogue-like games</a> ." <br>  Nethack - its most prominent representative. <br><br><br>  And what is so interesting and exciting in this game?  - you ask.  And I will answer you - the possibilities of the game, graphics, gameplay, plot. <br>  Yes Yes.  You heard right.  That is what is valuable in this game.

I think that is why in modern games it is impossible to take someone‚Äôs corpse and wield them like a weapon.  Or take a grenade launcher and use it as a baton.  Or skinned a dead dragon and pull on his skin. <br>  How to draw it?  How should the character and the environment behave in this case?  Do not draw, and if drawn, then schematically.  Have to think out :) <br>  In nethack'e this problem is solved ingeniously - think out everything yourself.  However, this is a common feature of all ASCII-art games. <br><br>  "See the percent symbol?"  This is food.  Is she green?  Then this is either a corpse of a <a href="http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Leprechaun">leprechaun</a> , or algae. ‚ÄùActually, your imagination will act as a graphic adapter :) <br>  After a while, you will reflexively fear the purple ‚ÄúL‚Äù, because for you this is already a terrible monster <a href="http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Arch-lich">Archi-Lich</a> , who will curse your <a href="http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Bag_of_holding">magic backpack</a> (which if not death, then life is a high price) and hardly pay attention to the newt crawling under your feet in the form of yellowish colon. <br>  Of course there are graphic versions of this game.  Even heard about 3D.  But all this only hinders.  Try, of course, worth it.  For example, I tried and went back to my favorite ASCII-art. <br><br>  At the request of readers.  The graphic version looks like this: <br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/09/15/07/20/5098014_640x480.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, there are still isometric graphic versions: the abandoned <a href="http://falconseye.sourceforge.net/">Falcon's Eye</a> and the now-living <a href="http://clivecrous.github.com/vultures/">Vulture's Eye</a> .  ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/infernal/" class="user_link">Infernal</a> prompted) <br><br><br><h2>  Plot </h2><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/09/13/01/51/5067986_654x336.png"><br>  The plot is simple to ugliness.  You, an adventurer, descend into a deep, deep dungeon in search of the <a href="http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Amulet_of_Yendor">amulet Yendor</a> .  Come down, take it, bring it and get eternal life as a gift.  Happy end. <br>  The plot does not distract from the gameplay and absolutely does not tell you what to do instantly.  And this is the most important thing. <br>  And, as a bonus, you will have one single quest (unique to the type of character), at the end of which you get a wonderful actoract ... Which one?  <a href="http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Quest">It depends</a> <br>  One game - one goal.  Nothing extra. <br><br><br><h2>  Gameplay and game features </h2><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/09/13/01/51/5067985_654x336.png"><br><br>  The mouse did not participate in the original version at all, because not all the computers at the time of the release of the game were with the mouse.  Later, of course, they made primitive support for the mouse, but I don‚Äôt even know why - it‚Äôs not needed there at all.  All control is carried out using the keyboard, with almost the entire keyboard (I think, not surprised). <br>  Unlike typical representatives of the RPG, this game takes place step by step, which inadvertently causes an association with chess.  Something has happened - do not rush to press the buttons.  Look at the current opportunities, reflect.  Quite tight - save and postpone an important decision until tomorrow (the benefit is already four in the morning on the clock and you have been playing eight hours without tearing off :) <br><br>  Typical situation: your character is three steps from death.  Standing next to an aggressive-minded fat troll, who is not going to die.  A typical RPG offers a very meager set of actions of your choice: fight to the death, a bottle of life and fight to the death or run off all legs. <br>  And in nethack the set of solutions to the situation is limitless.  You can, for example, take a magic stick-digger (wand of dig) and make a koldonut under your feet.  We will fall to the floor below, but we will survive.  Or take a marker and write the magic word "Elbereth" on the floor.  No monster dares to step on this inscription.  Or even use a polymorph spell on the monster and hope that it will turn into something small and pitiful.  Or, get the basilisk carcass from the stash and put in the control that there are forces.  Basilisk (ocatrice) turns into stone everyone who touches (I hope your character has put on gloves?).  Instead of a troll you will have a statue of a troll.  We live on.  A scroll of teleportation will also very effectively save you unmitaged death.  Teleport away.  Wear stealth ring.  And your character is quietly removed licked wounds.  Read the scroll of earth on the troll will fall a huge boulder.  Read the scroll of genocide and destroy all the trolls.  Pray finally to your deity (alt + p)!  God will hear your prayers and restore your health as a miracle.  Impressive? <br><br><br><h2>  <strike>Save often</strike> </h2><br>  All these attempts are justified, for the most powerful spell of all times and peoples ‚Äúsave and load‚Äù does not work, as in diablo, for example.  Only "save and exit."  And, like in Diablo on hardcore, a character can die only once :) Think hard before you do something.  This can be fatal for your character! <br><br><br><h2>  Knowledge of English and translations </h2><br>  A lot of attempts were made to russify nethack in order to make it more popular among the Russian-speaking population.  But a couple of nights and red eyes will allow you to freely navigate the English version.  I can only give advice to put the English version at once, and translate everything that is not clear with the dictionary.  Difficulties with language you experience the first ten deaths. <br>  Those who still decided on Russian nethak - here's a <a href="http://runethack.narod.ru/">link</a> .  Russian inferior, mixed with English, but still there.  But please!  Try English!  :) <br><br><br><h2>  Links </h2><br>  Lastly - a portion of references to all occasions. <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.nethack.org/">Official game site</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">Netha-wiki</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_nethack/">LiveJournal community "nethack_ru"</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethack">Russian wikipedia about nethack with a portion of links</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethack">English netkake wikipedia with a portion of links</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/spoilerlist.html">Spoilers</a>  (the most useful link after having dealt with the management) </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Liked?
