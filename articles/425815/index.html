  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who does not need SEO, how to choose an optimizer and check its work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I have been answering a lot of questions on search engine optimization on Toster.  Regularly I see that the developers relate to the ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù of my profession, at least wary, and sometimes frankly with dislike.  I used to think that these were all the prejudices of programmers, but after talking on the same toaster, I learned where this attitude came from.  And I understand you! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y4/s9/nt/y4s9ntcbneaaz1lvkdcxlsx1ur8.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Developers are terribly enraged when my "colleagues" optimizers rubbed the customer with some kind of heresy (according to the results of a free audit, for example), and the developer has to write detailed answers to several pages and explain on the fingers why what they write is nonsense. <br><br>  Adequate programmers understand that it is their responsibility to be responsible for their work, and how all people make mistakes and understand what a supervisor can find and point out to bottlenecks.  Usually they are ‚ÄúFor‚Äù such supervision and professional criticism.  But regular school questions and claims that do not come directly from the client, but from a seo theorist or joon or, even worse, a manager from some ‚Äúsuper-top SEO firm‚Äù is a tin.  And having communicated with a large number of developers, I realized that this is a common problem for both developers and customers.

      For those who are in search of an optimizer and for developers who regularly encounter representatives of my profession, made several selections on how to choose a competent specialist, how to evaluate the quality of work on search engine optimization and how to understand what the optimizer is rubbing outright game for you.  So to say, insider info from the enemy camp. <br><br><h3>  When do you need SEO? </h3><br><blockquote>  People who don't really need optimization are constantly turning to me. <br></blockquote><br>  They call and say something like this: ‚ÄúI have an online store, they started a month ago, we want a lot of sales.  Tried context, cmm, nothing helped, now all hope for SEO.  There is not much budget, you need to somehow do something. ‚Äù <br><br>  In such cases, you <b>do not need</b> SEO.  No budget - no need to do SEO!  You need to make money on marketing. <br><br>  First, determine the main sales channels and pump over those from where you can immediately get customers, such as context.  The context is also a thing that requires optimization and tests, and is highly dependent on the specialist setting it up.  The same Yandex.Market, Google merchant and other marketplaces need to be configured first and foremost, not SEO! <br><br>  In order to have a stable business you need several sales channels and yes, SEO can be one of them and can have a high priority, but should not be the main one (I‚Äôm talking about commerce and services, not about information resources) <br><br>  Set up other sales channels before doing SEO (unless there is a large investment) <br><br>  In your business, SEO is a dull traffic channel.  I am approached by photographers who sell pictures (NOT SERVICES, namely finished pictures), are not advertised anywhere, do not even instagram, but they want SEO magic.  What for ?!  There is very little of your traffic in search engines, you do not need optimization.  I understand in extremely rare cases, SEO may actually be necessary for the sale of photos, but this is a super rare exception. <br><br><blockquote>  SEO should be dealt with in two cases. <br><br>  <b>First</b> - there is a big budget from the start of the project to test the main sales channels and then it is worthwhile to do the initial internal optimization (without any references and other things). <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> , you already have several sales channels set up and you are ready to invest in promising development, here you should think about long-term cooperation in SEO. </blockquote><br>  You need to make a choice - <br><br><ul><li>  cool specialist for expensive </li><li>  luck on a schoolboy </li></ul><br>  In the first version it will be expensive, but with a 90% probability of quality.  Carefully choose a specialist, my criteria for choice would be such (given that I myself SEOshnik and I understand where the divorce, and where something is worthwhile). <br><br>  I strongly recommend choosing a freelancer with a large presence on the Internet and on professional resources.  It can be: <br><br><ul><li>  moderators or oldies forums </li><li>  leading blog, telegram channel or their group in social networks practicing SEOs </li><li>  who have a website, good at least outwardly, selling </li><li>  writing articles on professional resources </li><li>  having their own project (in addition to the client) which they promote </li><li>  having accounts on one or more freelance sites </li></ul><br><blockquote>  The older accounts in social networks, on freelancing, etc. - the better.  Reviews in accounts also matter! <br><br>  The greater the presence on the Internet - the higher the likelihood that a person is well versed in the subject, as well as the longer the industry - the better. </blockquote><br>  You can also find a novice SEO who will study on your site.  It will be cheap, and it seems to me the probability of efficiency is higher than if you take the middling.  But here, of course, it can be very ‚Äúfun‚Äù.  I now work with a developer who goes to school and is extremely pleased with him (there are some nuances, but where there are none). <br><br>  Under the spoiler, the answer to the common question: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What should know competent SEO-specialist</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Firstly: <br><br>  Technologies used by Google and Yandex: <br><br><ul><li>  micromarking (products, contacts and more) </li><li>  indexing robots, their types </li><li>  mobile technologies amp, Yandex. turbo </li><li>  types and types of ranking factors </li><li>  work with Yandex webmaster, search console google </li><li>  work with Yandex metrics and google analitycs </li><li>  snippets formation </li><li>  Yandex Wizards and Google Widgets </li><li>  various Google and Yandex search related services (maps, market, direct, edvords, etc.) </li><li>  factors affecting indexing (robots. tht, sitemap.hml, last-modified headers, attribute rel = canonical, etc.) </li></ul><br>  Technical knowledge: <br><br><ul><li>  html </li><li>  php </li><li>  js </li><li>  popular cms </li><li>  statistics and analytics </li></ul><br>  Additionally: <br><br><ul><li>  general understanding of internet marketing, sales channels and traffic </li><li>  ui / ux </li><li>  current trends and tools to drive traffic and increase conversions </li></ul></div></div><br>  And then the answer to the popular question: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to determine an intelligent SEO</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  View experience, online presence by SEO.  View reviews, if any, contact customers who have left feedback. <br><br>  100% no methods.  But a long presence in the SEO theme (profiles on a freelance website with a large and high-quality history, profiles on SEO forums, your own website / blog / publishing on Habr√©) and reviews with customer contacts in my opinion quite adequately reflect the professionalism of a specialist. <br><br>  Another option is if you understand yourself or there is a trusted person who understands, then ask the freelancer to send client sites and conduct an audit of his work with these sites. <br><br>  Learn optimization methods.  For example, working with usability and commercial factors for Yandex is a very good sign.  But the use of rented or just cheap eternal links in a large volume is already bad (if we talk about Yandex). <br><br>  Using Sape for Google (meaning overseas promotion) and not using it for Yandex will say that a specialist understands his business. <br><br>  You can contact the specialist voice and ask him questions (in which the specialist must understand).  For example: ‚ÄúWhat is last modified, how and for what is it used?‚Äù.  ‚ÄúIs it necessary to fill in meta messages, are there any differences in search engines?‚Äù. <br><br>  Of course, you have to prepare yourself or order questions and answers to them somewhere.  Incidentally, I met many such questions on the toaster. </div></div><br>  It is necessary to decide exactly what you need: <br><br><ul><li>  regular work on the result </li><li>  one-time optimization </li></ul><br>  Of course, you want to have a person in constant access, but sometimes it is simply not necessary, but it is enough to conduct internal optimization and not spend money in the air. <br><br>  In my experience, regular work is only on very large projects and projects that are regularly amended.  If you think "how is it, and links !?" Who will buy links every month?  Links are often simply not needed. <br><br><blockquote>  If the promotion is more in Yandex, and you first set up several sales channels and they are profitable, then it will be enough to make a high-quality internal optimization and work in depth with UX. </blockquote><br>  In Yandex, for commerce (shopping services), behavioral factors and internal optimization (including <a href="https://habr.com/post/415991/">commercial factors</a> ) are important; links are extremely rarely needed.  Therefore, most of the time, shops and service sites with well-developed, profitable online sales channels simply do not need constant project management, have done internal optimization and wait for 3-4 months, in 90% of cases you will already see a cool result.  I will not consider special cases as for this I will need to write a separate article. <br><br><blockquote>  Accordingly, in 90% of cases there is simply no point in paying the money to the optimizer every month, one-time optimization is enough! </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Regular maintenance is necessary for shops with a very large assortment, websites selling services in a highly competitive area and regularly updating large and medium-sized projects. </blockquote><br><h3>  How to control the work of SEO </h3><br><ol><li>  Hire a supervisor (very many provide this service) You can always order a one-time inspection service, for example, technical tasks written by the optimizer from a serious specialist or even from several. </li><li>  At least a little to enter the topic, find banal checklists, check the work on them and for each item with an error, ask to explain why it is not corrected. </li><li> Register on the SEO forum and periodically upload your website there with a request to evaluate the optimization.  Free version of supervision. </li><li>  Require monthly reports and, if possible, check. </li></ol><br>  I didn‚Äôt see more adequate and really working options, but I personally encountered all of the above.  Developed with a Toaster, as I supported this list. <br><br><h3>  Mistakes that optimizers often make <br></h3><br><ul><li>  do not check for trivial things, for example, redirects from urlov slashem at the end and from BBB to BBB </li><li>  do not know and do not offer to implement microdata </li><li>  Do not prescribe meta-keywords for Yandex, because they live in delusion that it is not needed </li><li>  slaughtered on sitemap.xml and generally it is not monitored </li><li>  do not give a breakdown of grouped semantics by pages </li><li>  Do not check for developers if SEO TZ is done, such as once the developer has said that everything is ready, then everything is ready (it is necessary to check, we are all human) </li><li>  forget to work with the witches Yandex </li><li>  buy rented and just spam links for Yandex (you can't do that) </li><li>  do not buy rented links for Google overseas (this is a very cheap and Google-working tool if you can use it) </li><li>  do not take commercial factors into account </li><li>  they forget, at least at a minimal level, to work through UX from commercial and behavioral factors.  Study at least at the minimum level is necessary. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425815/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425815/</a></p>
