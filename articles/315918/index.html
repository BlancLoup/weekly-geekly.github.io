      Here is what he told Kate Rockwood: <br><br>  My parents moved to America near the end of the Cold War, fleeing the massacre that began in Afghanistan.  I was then about 4 years old, and my first memory was a trip from the Los Angeles airport straight to the coast.  There are no beaches in Afghanistan.  It seemed that a completely unfamiliar world had opened up before me. <br><br>  We did not have a penny, but obtaining political asylum gave us a chance <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/perezagruzka-svoey-zhizni-1/">to start a new life</a> .  My father took on any job - selling drinks in a shopping center, was a taxi driver.  I helped him to open an export-import company.  But I always had the desire to do something more and repay a debt to a country that gave my family a second chance. <br><br>  After graduating from college, I moved from California to Washington.  I did my undergraduate practice at the Ministry of Defense, and I managed to stay there as a manager of government programs.  One of the projects I have led, A-Space, has been awarded the title of the best design by Time magazine.  It is a closed social network for intelligence workers, where they can share their ideas and information. <br><br>  I switched to major military contractors, but when faced with bureaucracy, I quickly became disillusioned.  I would like to be engaged in business, bringing real benefit to the state, and not to waste my time on raking internal bureaucracy.  I thought, ‚ÄúWhy don't I <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/7-idej-dlja-zapuska-svoego-dela-o-kotoryh-luchshe-zabyt/">run my own business</a> ?‚Äù <br><br>  So in 2011, I took up the creation of ByteCubbed.  I wanted to understand how to help the government extract information from documents, analyze it and make smarter decisions.  But start-ups usually find it difficult to get the right to conclude a basic contract, much more often they act as subcontractors.  It was from this point that I started: I cooperated with large companies and used those crumbs that they gave me.  I agreed to any suggestion. <br><br>  We grew up, and I brought home almost half a million dollars as a salary.  But he was still deeply unhappy.  All this did not correspond to my understanding of the present case.  I wanted to rule over my fate, but I was forced to depend on the whims of those very large contractors. <br><br>  When my wife carried our first child under the heart, the moment came ‚Äúnow or never.‚Äù  I was afraid that if I didn‚Äôt do anything radical in the near future, then I wouldn‚Äôt be able to start from scratch.  Therefore, I refused to rent an office monthly, reduced expenses to a minimum and sold all my subcontracts for pennies.  This gave the business 8 months of savings.  The number of employees has been reduced from 10 to 2 people. <br><br>  Over the first project I fought for several months, and then followed a period of painful waiting.  I looked at my phone so often that in the end my spouse persuaded me to make a little trip in order to relax.  We were in a hotel room when the news came that ByteCubbed got a 5-year contract with the Ministry of Defense worth $ 1.2 million a year.  My wife was beside herself with delight. <br><br>  But I began to recruit new employees and rent an office only a few months later, when the second and third contracts were concluded.  When our staff reached 40 people, I found a great room of 450 m¬≤.  Then we got another order.  Now we have 140 employees, and we finally moved to a new office.  It has more than 1500 m¬≤.  And we have room to grow. <br><br>  <b>PS We</b> recommend another useful article on the topic of business development - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/uroki-kotorye-izvlekli-iz-svoix-neudach-7-ochen-uspeshnyx-lyudej/">Lessons learned from 7 of their failures from very successful people</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315918/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315918/</a></p>
