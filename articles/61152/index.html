  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Technical hosting organization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last time I talked about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/60920/">how not to build the organizational part of hosting</a> .  Now I will talk about how you can organize technical. <br><br>  There are six things that any hosting provider relies on: Server, Panel, Domains, Accounting, Support, Legal Organization.  Now I will tell the main choices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Server. </h5><br>  Four options: <br>  <b>Reselling</b> is inexpensive, no need to set up a server.  But you depend on the upstream host more than in other cases.  Everywhere, except cpanel you can not create sub-resellers (I do not envy such customers).  High-quality reselling usually costs between $ 10-15 per gigabyte. <br>  <b>VDS or Virtual Dedicated Server</b> - you need to configure the server, complete freedom of choice, what and how to do.  If you break something, you have to fix it yourself.  Besides, there is a slight dependence on the owner of the VDS node.  Cost from $ 30 for VDS with 368 MB of RAM (Less is impossible, have pity for customers) <br>  <b>Dedicated server for rent</b> - The same advantages as that of VDS, but if something hangs, you can not restart or quickly rearrange through a convenient socket.  True, reboot panels are sometimes provided.  The cost is highly dependent on the country. <br>  <b>Dedicated server for colocation</b> - Practically the same as the previous item, but cheaper for a month, you can quickly pick up and put it in another place.  If iron fails, no one will supply anything new for free.  Server price - from two thousand dollars, placement per month - from two thousand rubles per unit. <br><br>  Rental prices are very different from the country. <br>  <b>Russia</b> - the maximum speed from Russia, but more expensive than everywhere.  Ping to a server from Moscow in Moscow is not more than 10 Ms. <br>  <b>Germany</b> - good speed and low prices.  Ping from Moscow about 60 Ms. <br>  <b>USA</b> - inexpensive, speed about 100-200 Kb / s.  Ping from Moscow about 150 Ms (Ocean after all). <br>  <b>Holland</b> - average prices, speed about 300 Kb / s, ping 60-80.  I like something very much.

      <br>
      You also need to make a panel selection. <br>  <b><a href="http://cpanel.net/">cPanel</a></b> - Monster, there are many functions thrown into a heap and sometimes made illogical.  Expensive, requires 512 MB of RAM from VDS.  If the client part is more or less convenient, then the administrator and reseller requires a search function every time.  Not bad for working over SSH.  Russification is, but it is terrible. <br>  <b><a href="http://directadmin.com/">DirectAdmin</a></b> - Looks good, functions are conveniently and logically structured.  It does not have all the functions of cpanel and is supported by a slightly smaller number of billing panels.  There is no official Russification. <br>  <b><a href="http://ispmanager.ru/">ISPManager</a></b> - A fairly young panel, it looks beautiful, there are some functions.  Overseas billing is not supported, but Russification is already included.  When I used it, it was pretty buggy. <br><br>  It is better to take the panel from the one from whom you are hosting the server, since internal licenses are much cheaper.  DA has Code 500 ($ 5) and cPanel has an internal license at around $ 20.  ISPManager has gold partners who sell licenses almost twice cheaper. <br><br><h5>  Domains </h5><br>  Sooner or later, the client will want to register a domain with you.  There are many registrars who offer reseller programs.  Now the situation has changed a lot, so I can‚Äôt say anything.  A year ago, it was possible to get reselling domains at a price of 120 - 150 rubles apiece without any problems. <br>  There are two rules here - always register a domain for a client and look for a billing that is compatible with the registrar. <br><br><h5>  Billing </h5><br>  There are several Russified systems. <br>  <b><a href="http://bpanel.ru/">bPanel</a></b> - Panel from AdvantA.org hosting.  Because of the relatively low price is the majority of hosters in the CIS.  If you alter the template and rewrite the language files - it can look decent. <br>  <b><a href="http://clientexec.com/">ClientExec</a> or Russian version of <a href="http://cepanel.ru/">CEpanel</a></b> - Panel, Russified hoster MIRhosting.com.  It is inexpensive, but inside was not very comfortable, although quite logical. <br>  <b><a href="http://whmcs.com/">WHMCS</a> ( <a href="http://whm-cs.ru/">Russian version</a> )</b> - A cool thing, but it is expensive.  If the high price does not scare away - you can take. <br>  <b><a href="http://rootpanel.ru/">rootpanel</a></b> - Good because many have an open source version.  I haven't seen her for a long time, so I can't say anything. <br><br><h5>  Support </h5><br>  <b>E-mail</b> is simple, cheap, inconvenient. <br>  <b>ICQ</b> is not the best idea if you have more than one person.  The syncs of the story have not yet been invented, ICQ is easily hijacked and sometimes there are problems with AOL. <br>  <b>Ticker</b> - a thing that will process incoming letters and convert them into tickets, which can answer any employee.  There are free and paid, somehow write a review.  Some billing have built-in. <br>  <b>Live-chat</b> - an employee sits either in a web application or in a computer program.  When a client clicks a button on a site, he can consult with an employee.  For serious questions, it is usually usually sent by e-mail. <br><br><h5>  Form of doing business </h5><br>  <b>It is illegal</b> to say nothing about yourself, not to start a legal entity.  So many do, did not know of cases that such people were imprisoned.  People are not very good at these because of the potential for low reliability. <br>  <b>Legal entity without a license</b> - Make a legal entity, but do not issue a license.  Or a tricky contract is made (If the hosting is provided free of charge, then a license is not needed. If you are a design studio and you support websites, everything should be fine. Some provide ‚Äúconsulting services‚Äù. <br>  <b>Legal entity with a license</b> - Expensive and painful way.  The server should be only dedicated and only in Russia (You can put the servers in another country and one in Russia).  You also need to make out the site of communication.  All together it will take about six months and 100 thousand rubles in the company.  A ready-made company costs 250-400 thousand. <br>  <b>Under the contract</b> - You can enter into a partnership agreement with a larger firm.  They have a license, and you sell their hosting.  So I was not interested, to be honest, so I can not say anything. <br><br>  That seems to be all.  In the comments to answer any questions. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61152/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61152/</a></p>
