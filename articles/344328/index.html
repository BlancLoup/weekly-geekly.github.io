How to understand if this is relevant for your site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Often, the speed of sites is estimated very subjectively.  That is, the authorities / developers / administrators are satisfied and not enraged - it means that everything is fine.  Is it so?  Marketers appreciate their target audience very well, but not everyone reaches out to see how this target audience sees your site.  Geographically distributed test response time from the <a href="http://www.host-tracker.com/">service monitoring web sites HostTracker</a> helps to find the truth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8q/mc/7j/8qmc7ji3gavbz2xtq22fdggelq8.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How acute is this problem? </h4><br>  In one of the previous publications, we provided an <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/host-tracker/blog/329010/">entertaining infographic</a> on the impact of site speed on traffic and conversion.  From experience we can say that website development usually takes place in several stages.  First, the customer wants it to be "beautiful."  And the site is being promoted using SEO techniques with lots of shades of gray.  Then the main stress is shifted to the content.  And only then, perhaps, reach the hands of optimization.  This is true for almost all small, medium and even non-specialized IT companies in large companies (for example, banks).  Do not believe?  Enter any request in Google - you are very lucky if all sites from the first page of the issue will work quickly.  As a rule, these are 2-3, which, in fact, are the leaders in their field.  Tens and hundreds of others let everything go by itself. <br><br><h4>  Why the site can be loaded for a long time and what can be done about it </h4><br>  The actual request can be divided into several components: determining the location of the site, setting up a client-server connection and displaying data at the client.  The first is entirely dependent on the hosting.  If the DNS is bad and long determined, or a large ping connection, you need to demand better conditions or even immediately move.  The second is on your conscience, although we still keep the hosting issue under review.  What is there to pay attention to?

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
    <ul><li>  Server side scripts.  If they contain complex calculations, unload large volumes from the base and the like, you should pay attention to them.  Sometimes for optimization it is necessary to alter the entire logic of the site or even change the development framework.  If you started with a business card site, and then suddenly an online store turned out - then, most likely, this is just such a case. </li><li>  Client side scripts.  Probably the most popular cause of ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù.  To hang around the site with various usefulness - why not?  But it is better to give up all this, except for the most critical moments.  However, some scripts from leading companies of the market, such as Google, are constantly being improved and keep up with the times.  That is, they run asynchronously, deliberately minimize inconvenience for users, taking into account the actual page loading process.  But not everyone can do that.  Until. </li><li>  Downloadable content.  Do you really need to show this wonderful gallery on the very first page?  But these lists, for real-time relevance loaded from the database - without them in any way?  Database and media file optimization are a whole series of big questions about caching, CDN and query optimization.  Therefore, it‚Äôs best to keep this on the first page of the site at a minimum and, if necessary, contact good specialists.  And yes, it is usually expensive. </li></ul><br><h4>  To notice a problem is the first step to a solution. </h4><br>  When do you need to start addressing this issue?  Ideally, as well as when raising a child, even during development :) <br><br>  But in practice it happens in different ways.  You can notice the problem with the help <a href="https://www.host-tracker.com/Blog/speed">of the HostTracker monitoring service</a> . <br>  Here is a real example of the behavior of the site of a popular TV channel: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/33/5n/ba/335nbay8v79b4qjqpw1xpns0g6g.png"><br>  Here the peaks are checks from Asia.  As we see, for the Asian audience the site is not optimized. <br>  You can also notice the division of response time into three components: the time to determine the DNS, the time the connection is established and the page headers load, and the load time of the rest.  That is, to determine the stability of the site and the weakest link in its speed is very simple. <br><br>  Also, taking a look at the example above, one can say: ‚ÄúBut I do not need Africa and Asia.  All my clients are in the city of N. ‚ÄùAnd there is also a solution for this!  Unfortunately, it will not be possible to sort out for specific cities (for technical reasons), but to select a region of the world to weed out false alarms from the distant kingdoms is completely: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/md/bc/vd/mdbcvd9albb3uzk1bqxsfwbnbvy.png"><br><br>  I note that we often receive requests for the optimization of our functions, so their what we have now is the result of the practical use of the service by our clients.  At the moment we are working on a function that will allow you to simulate a full page load, along with all the whistles, for now only the code is loaded.  Therefore, if you have any questions or suggestions - we will be glad to take them into account. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344328/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344328/</a></p>
