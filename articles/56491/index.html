This was a great news not only for short link services, but also for those sites that use this service (even if using this service, the user wants to go to another site).  The idea is not the latest, some services have been using it for several years.  We have compiled a list of 7 major sites that use it, and explain what they are doing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Google / Ask / Yahoo / Live Image Search</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20090403/Yahoo-image-search_610x291.png" alt="image">

      <i>Finding images on Yahoo allows you to save the user interface and quickly return to the previous pages.</i> <br><br>  Image search engines on Google, Ask, Live and Yahoo use a rectangular toolbar, or a special toolbar that splits content into separate parts.  When you click on an image from the list at the top of the page on any of these search engines, a block of data with information about copyright, image size and a link to view the image in full size remains.  The most important fact is that it allows the user to easily start a new search or return to previous results. <br><br>  <b>Why it is needed:</b> From external links you can always return to search results, and - more importantly - return to the page with advertising.  This allows the company to increase the frequency of viewing ads.  Also, from the point of view of users, it is much more convenient to use return paths, especially if the search result is unsatisfactory.  In this case, the ideal option is to save the return function to the search page in the encoding of the link page. <br><br>  <b>Facebook</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20090403/Facebook-bar-inaction_610x129.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>The toolbar on Facebook is intricate, but not as advanced as on the services described above.</i>  <i>But it provides the opportunity to leave a comment or share the current link on popular social networks.</i> <br><br>  The system link sharing on Facebook appeared at the end of 2006.  However, it was only recently that this service was fixed on the toolbar, on which information about the source is now visible (in case one of your friends posted this information), as well as the option to post a comment, the ability to post an article in your news or share this linking with someone else. <br><br>  <b>Why it is needed:</b> Facebook offers for its users the same image manipulation capabilities as search engines.  At the top of the page, simply add a function to comment or share the image with someone else.  This is a special help when searching for real estate, as you can observe objects from their real location without leaving the site page. <br><br>  <b>Stumbleupon</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20090403/StumbleUpon-bar_610x41.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>The StumbleUpon toolbar follows the user from site to site, changing to your browser style.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  StumbleUpon unveiled <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10055044-2.html">its version of the toolbar</a> back in September.  Instead of toolbars that require their own software, a rectangular panel appears at the top of the page, on which the following options are presented: place the site with one to five stars and mark the page you like.  Most importantly, the Stumble! Button is always saved on the panel with which you can start a new search that is based on the results of your own polls. <br><br>  <b>Why it is needed:</b> For StumbleUpon, this is an easy way to attract more people without spending too much on it.  Previously, users could randomly get only to those sites that others considered to be viewable, but now, without extra registrations and downloads, you yourself can vote and influence random choices.  Even better, the panel proceeds with retaining links to the sites visited, so friends can exchange useful links. <br><br>  <b>Digg</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20090403/Diggbar-inaction_610x84.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>The DiggBar toolbar, which was released on Thursday, provides various social features from site to site.</i> <br><br>  DiggBar, if you are not already in the know, is a great new project designed to facilitate the exchange of links to external sources and provide an opportunity to return to Digg at any time if you have finished viewing the page.  Now any link from the Digg homepage uses this panel.  It is fixed on top of the page you are on, and gives you the opportunity to read other articles from this source, share it with friends and simultaneously communicate on the Digg network.  In addition, your link is automatically shortened to facilitate its placement in IM clients and on sites for microblogging (for example, Twitter). <br><br>  <b>Why it is needed:</b> Digg is not only a major information portal, but now also provides people with a service that allows them to shorten URLs and share them with their friends.  To use these options, users require a minimum of effort.  Oh yes, when viewing comments, you can read ads, related articles on this topic or source, which allows you to increase the frequency of viewing advertising on the site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56491/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56491/</a></p>
