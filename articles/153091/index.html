Sometimes, it happens, they trap without warning.  Projects - from design to programming, from texts to 3D.  But the project has to wait long enough <br>  With regard to the experience of use, then on this site, in my personal impression, you can find only small and medium projects.  Partly due to the fact that in the heads of customers there is only one site where freelancers <s>hang</s> out and <s>hang</s> out on the other exchanges. <br>  Reviews: <br><ul><li>  On the webcast, orders are few and more difficult to start.  I have an old acc banned there after hacking and it is absolutely incomprehensible what to do in such a situation.  At that time it was easier to abandon weblans. </li></ul>

    <h5><img src="http://www.free-lancers.net/favicon.ico" alt="image">  free-lancers.net </h5><br><br>  <a href="http://www.free-lancers.net/">www.free-lancers.net</a> - mostly small projects.  There are paid acci, but the whole payment is that you can respond to the project after a period of time after publication.  For large projects, the limitation is not essential. <br><br><h5><img src="http://freelance.ru/favicon.ico" alt="image">  freelance.ru </h5><br>  <a href="http://freelance.ru/">freelance.ru</a> is a small exchange, mostly projects that are average in terms of cost / duration.  Although, in my memory from there came a couple of times interesting projects <br><br><h5>  free-lancer.ru </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.free-lancer.ru/">free-lancer.ru</a> - worked before, now under reconstruction, waiting. <br><br><h5>  prohq.ru </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.prohq.ru/">prohq.ru</a> - just started developing labor exchange.  As they say in sports, let's wait another year. <br><br><h5><img src="http://globalfreelance.ua/favicon.ico" alt="image">  globalfreelance.ua </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.globalfreelance.ua/index.php/ru/">globalfreelance.ua</a> - Orders from around the world.  Tasks are divided by science.  In the registration process, you must pass a test in those subjects and areas of science that you specify.  It eliminates people who have no idea what they are up to. <br>  Quote from the site: <br>  At the moment we highlight several main activities: <br><ul><li>  performance of academic tasks in the field of exact and natural sciences - mathematics, physics, programming, chemistry, biology, economic theory, etc .; </li><li>  writing academic works in the humanities - history, philosophy, cultural studies, psychology, literature, law, etc. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  workzilla.ru </h5><br>  <a href="http://workzilla.ru/">workzilla.ru</a> is just beginning to develop, so far there is nothing to say. <br><br><h5><img src="http://www.superjob.ru/favicon.ico" alt="image">  superjob.ru </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.superjob.ru/projects">superjob.ru</a> - I can‚Äôt say anything here, I haven‚Äôt come across it, but the people write in the topic. <br><br><h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7bf/9d0/76e/7bf9d076e2eed5897ee19d2d866c8b7a.png" alt="image">  free-lancing.ru </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.free-lancing.ru/">free-lancing.ru</a> - similarly, it was not necessary to use <br><br>  Well, a few more for a snack: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.freelancejob.ru/">freelancejob.ru</a> is a common freelance exchange. <br>  <a href="http://www.dalance.ru/">dalance.ru</a> is similar. <br>  <a href="http://www.webpersonal.ru/">webpersonal.ru</a> is modest, but it still works. <br>  <a href="http://1clancer.ru/">1clancer.ru</a> - specialized for 1C programmers. <br><br><h4>  Foreign countries: </h4><br><br><h5><img src="https://www.odesk.com/favicon.ico" alt="image">  odesk.com </h5><br>  <a href="https://www.odesk.com/">www.odesk.com</a> is a giant and freelance monster.  There hang out most of the Russian-speaking freelancers.  The job of finding a specialty is simple enough, because there is everything.  On the other hand, the exchange's PRI is a big obstacle when starting work ‚Äî the number of responses to projects of 50 people is a normal phenomenon, and the portfolio should be taken more carefully, ideally, your website-portfolio. <br><br>  Reviews: <br><ul><li>  Communication exclusively in English while the level of English should be such that you are free to type + sometimes interviews must be held in the video chat.  the competition is huge.  Depending on the specialization for one project, there can be up to 40 bids (i.e. freelancers' offers).  All customers require work that they can see.  The main role on these exchanges is played not by your talent for programming, but by the talent to ‚Äúpush‚Äù.  Why precisely vparivat?  because the rest of the freelancers are doing just that, and against the background of them you can look like a black sheep (or even a gray one such a small funnel).  And of course, price dumping is very serious.  As a rule, many freelancers already have some groundwork, with which they embed.  The mode of operation is naturally evening (from 15 o'clock in Kiev).  Those.  You can work in the morning, but at 15 o'clock the customer wakes up and you communicate with him until 23-24 at night because he is full of energy. </li><li>  about dumping - perhaps the Indians like to lower the bar, but it is also noted that customers are not always led by the one who gives less.  As for Vpar, I don‚Äôt agree to let it go there for a long time, but for both projects that I liked I went through, the third one is now in a frozen state, because the customer himself doesn‚Äôt fully know the requirements, but we already have quite good relations.  If by ‚Äúpushing‚Äù you understand a competent cover letter with an approximate explanation of how you already understand the project right away and what you will do to make the project end successfully, if necessary, immediately clarify some slippery questions, then in my understanding this is ‚Äúgood tone‚Äù and not pairing.  Yes, and customers treat such applicants an order of magnitude better than those who press ‚Äúaccept‚Äù and one phrase ‚Äúyou will get better, you only pay.‚Äù Perhaps if you are engaged in purely freelancing, other parties will be noticeable, but for the time being I watch projects that I'm interested in learning new technologies or digging as a hobby, because the current workplace is completely fine with me =) </li></ul><br><br><h5>  elance.com </h5><br>  <a href="https://www.elance.com/">elance.com</a> is another major exchange.  There is work for everyone. <br><br><h5><img src="http://freelancer.com/favicon.ico" alt="image">  freelancer.com </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.freelancer.com/">www.freelancer.com</a> - something at the level of free-lance.ru.  Not too many projects, but the work can be viewed for many specialties. <br><br><h5><img src="http://www.vworker.com/favicon.ico" alt="image">  vworker.com </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.vworker.com/">vworker.com</a> - <s>it looks like a clone of the previous site, since the list of customers is well, just tracing the</s> rebranding of rentacoder.com.  Relatively small labor exchange. <br><br><h5><img src="http://www.guru.com/favicon.ico" alt="image">  guru.com </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.guru.com/">guru.com</a> is another exchange.  <s>So far I can not say anything about it :)</s> <br>  Price <br>  Monthly membership - $ 12.94 to $ 45.44 per month (for one profile).  For example, Websites &amp; Ecommerce category costs $ 32.44 <br>  Annual memberships are 50% off <br>  Transactions fee 7.45% <br>  Money withdraw fee - Direct deposit (US bank accounts only) - no fees. <br>  PayPal - no Guru fees. <br>  Prepaid MasterCard (Payoneeer) - no Guru fees. <br>  Wire transfer (Non-US bank accounts only) - $ 9.00 per wire transfer. <br>  Price per bid: <br>  100 bids every 30 days <br>  Number Bid Pax Cost <br>  100 $ 25.00 <br>  250 $ 45.00 <br>  500 $ 75.00 <br>  Projects only with a fixed budget for the agreed amount of work. <br>  There are Dispute Resolution for SafePay projects. <br>  Projects for every taste.  There are many of them.  Judging by experience, the average price for the same work on eLance and Odesk is higher than on Guru. <br>  Communication is only in English (at least at the level of chat in Skype and email), you need to show past work.  The probability of getting an order is higher if you describe the solution or show a similar job in the portfolio. <br><br>  I propose to comment, the post will be edited with the receipt of information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153091/</a></p>
