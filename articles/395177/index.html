  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Open Bionics, Eidos Montreal and Razer create a line of cyber finishes in the style of Deus EX</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The versatility, elaboration and fascination of the storyline and the smallest details of the game world and existing characters - all this contribute to the fact that today the audience of fans of popular computer games is calculated in numbers with many zeros.  But it turns out that in some aspects, the ideas of developers of computer characters and their equipment may well go beyond the gaming scenario and even form the basis of a design that will serve people in their three-dimensional reality.  This is confirmed by the new line of prosthetic hands from Open Bionics, made in the style of the heroes of the cult Deus Ex. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/111/9bb/d63/1119bbd63a22467b8ec92524c63d7756.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Deus Ex: Mankind Divided (2015) from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidos_Interactive">Eidos Montreal</a> is just a case in point when the game, far from reality, inspired engineers to create something that some people really lack in their daily lives. . <br><br>  Announced in April 2015, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex">‚ÄúDeus Ex: Mankind Divided‚Äù</a> with Adam Jensen, who is perfectly familiar to us from Deus Ex: Human Revolution, as the main missionary, the game is distinguished by the special attention of developers to work through the smallest details of the sci-fi world of 2029, implemented in the style of cyberpunk .  The release of the game is expected in August 2016.  On the territory of Russia and the CIS, the game will be published by the company ‚ÄúBuka‚Äù and will be released entirely in Russian.

Of course, we are trying to convince ourselves that the creators of the gaming world are no more than owners of violent fantasy and until the moment when technologies reach a similar level and can dissolve into society still very, very far away. <br><br>  But perhaps we are rushing to conclusions?  It is enough to remember how our world looked 16 years ago, when owning a cell phone with a monochrome screen was the lot of the elect, and the Internet operator had to dial 30 minutes to open one of several existing thematic sites!  Nobody suspected about pleasant, convenient and pleasant things and functions with the prefix ‚Äúi‚Äù.  Today, for us, this is already an everyday reality, taken for granted.  Why not assume that, as the authors of the game promised, in some 10-15 years it is just as natural for humanity to perceive cybernetic prostheses of the arms, legs, eyes and other parts of the body and organs?  Again the flight of imagination?  By no means.  - Similar developments exist now, and some of them are incredibly close to what we have already seen in the computer world of Deus Ex, and they look very promising. <br><br>  <b>God's armor</b> <br><br>  Despite the fact that the cyberimplant industry began to develop only from the mid-90s, tangible results of robotics were achieved only with the advent of relatively affordable microprocessors and relatively compact in size. <br><br>  Is it possible to call the absolute majority of prosthetic hands, manufactured by the industry a decade ago, and even those produced by augmentations, successful additions?  Of course, no, it is rather a forced compensation of a physical defect expressed in the absence of a hand.  To manage the most common of them is almost impossible, not to mention the convenience of capture and retention, especially small items.  And in this sense, artificial limbs that are widely available today in their functionality and level of comfort are not much different from what could be seen in the Middle Ages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e8/b29/002/5e8b290021210edddc2fd7b00e02cb9c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But it is impossible not to recognize certain changes: more and more often developers are announcing the creation of prostheses of a new generation, giving people a new level of opportunities.  One of them is i-Limb hand prosthesis from the Scottish company <a href="http://www.touchbionics.com/">Touch Bionics</a> .  This unique prosthesis allows a person who has lost an arm to use all 5 fingers again.  i-Limb equally successfully copes with the retention of small items, coffee mugs, dialing numbers on the screen of a cellular phone and carrying a weighty suitcase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f67/5ab/a65/f675aba65ab759137f4cf066538d6627.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The prosthesis is controlled by two sensors that read information from the muscle groups responsible for certain movements of the arm.  It is quite simple to master the skills of prosthetic control - it is enough to command the muscles on an intuitive level, imagining that the real hand is still in its place.  The breakthrough made by Scottish robotics is impressive, but in retrospect i-Limb is already a somewhat outdated model, which today, however, remains one of the most accessible on the market. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590">DARPA</a> also offered its version of the cybernetic prosthesis with the difference that the mechanical limb is controlled not by the group of remaining muscles, but by a chip implanted in the brain, which records the signals of neurons and transforms them into movements.  Armed with such a prosthesis, a disabled person can not only take objects in his hand, but also with enviable ease to manipulate and connect separate fingers among themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a7d/c91/4a3/a7dc914a36e7e9e9a52e755d764bac47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  DARPA has funded and continues to fund alternative development in this area.  One of them is the project of the prosthesis DEKA Arm System, from the creator of segway, Dean Keiman, named after the bionic arm of Luke Skywalker from star wars.  In this case, the inventor decided to go the other way - by proposing a modular prosthesis capable of adapting to the particular physiology of a particular person and not requiring any surgical operations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e09/868/975/e0986897537756e10aa5f14f57c66eed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Blurring Worlds</b> <br><br>  Now, erasing the boundaries between the game world and reality, Open Bionics, which uses 3D printing technology to create its prostheses, has announced the development of a new line of prosthetic hands, which look almost indistinguishable from the extremities of the Deus Ex game world.  The company's management adjusts the fact that, at a cost, the developed dentures will be available to most people who want to buy them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fb7/7f4/e43/fb77f4e43b926dd63c8352245a4d20b3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To achieve these goals, Open Bionics has joined forces with the developers of Deus Ex - <a href="https://eidosmontreal.com/">Eidos Montreal</a> and <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/">Razer</a> .  Eidos developers have taken on the creation of the concept and design.  The idea is to make prostheses not only functional and useful, but also beautiful, so that it is pleasant to look at them.  Of course, there are no blades and emphasis on combat augmentations in the design is not provided - we are talking only about visual consistency and preservation of the style decision. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/19e/0a2/5be/19e0a25be7d469a6be7df4fd00fd4a31.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Razer division has begun to develop a Stargazer camera that is capable of tracking movements and will allow the potential target audience to demonstrate the capabilities of the mechanical arm using augmented reality technology at upcoming E3 and Gamescom exhibitions. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ia3P-_RHVWQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjAT75k_A36Mo4nB2RXIPkb6SMeug" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A definite plus of the development is the fact that the preliminary sketches and other developments of Eidos Montreal and Open Bionics will provide for possible improvements to everyone for free. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJ_8woKKOq0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiT0xAi-FEvSktJ0uD_OOzooFizcw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
