So, this is not an accident. <br><br>  This event, which we have been preparing since May 2015, meant holding a forum in 3 sections of 21 speakers and a separate hall for holding the Olympiad in CTF format, where the 9 best scoreboards were awarded prizes.

      I hope this post is not considered for advertising, because  the event has already passed, and the purpose of the publication is to collect not indifferent people to cyber security in Ukraine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01c/181/f37/01c181f37e1743ad90ab7f6834e3eb42.jpg"><br><br>  Next - photos and videos. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A week before the event, our site was hacked, or rather zadefeysili. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/cfb/2da/464cfb2da75f4599a3ef65a726285de7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This was expected and we, of course, made it public and published officially <br><br>  The deface stood for exactly 2 minutes.  The site was at that time in development. <br><br>  Everything was within the framework of ethical hacking.  The craftsman called, introduced himself and notified the developers with the organizers about the incident, for which he received his prize and public fame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a4/6fe/cf8/3a46fecf87d241a595c9d72ce7d25752.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We have gathered surprisingly many people.  Pupils, students, information security experts and teachers gathered. <br><br>  For the time being, speakers amazed listeners who were incomprehensible, even for IT people, with words like: sniffing, skimmer, de-anonymization, quad-vpn and others. A fierce battle was taking place for the search for flags among the participants of the CTF Olympiad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b57/94f/4ca/b5794f4ca13f4525b6efdf733744ef9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/337/310/65d/33731065dad67fe8e748d93c4d82e0fd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It was established 15 wifi points connected to the gigabit channel.  Trays with cookies were constantly updated and coffee with delicious teas was poured, and in the middle of the day there was a lunch in the format of a buffet table so that you could take a break and gain strength. <br><br>  A rather difficult task was to make an unforgettable and interesting show out of the event for the inhabitants who are far from cybersecurity and IT, since  outwardly, nothing interesting happens: the ‚Äúcomputer people‚Äù sit and click on the keyboard.  But the guys from the event agencies who helped us in the organization came up with many interesting stands, as well as the broadcast of the Olympiad together with the scoreboard in the common hall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edd/978/ca0/edd978ca05a745329584fa9489567fea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da5/bfe/e42/da5bfee424b44afe83e96d7a6bbe8b60.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/564/389/077/564389077f124cb484b98368e421eff5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/734/f75/3be/734f753beadb43c1a972fa27fec209ae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Cutting footage that was mounted on the day of the event for display on the big screen at the end of the day: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HtPoNIjw87Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiLRDriztlaXDaqMJ9Vwj8J_QgONg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And there was also a great cyber-themed dance. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hy2eZS9Ihk0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhPH2sHBG6sj30Zb9Wvf5tcWWVnYw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It was not easy, hard and sometimes nerves passed, but we did it.  Particularly pleased with the level of the people we gathered at the event.  We tried to do everything so that this event was progressive, not sovok, we burned a lot of chips, insider information and real-life cases that can not be found anywhere on the Internet. <br><br>  The event successfully coincided with the formation of cyber police in Ukraine.  We sincerely hope that the level of training of special agents and inspectors will be applicable and practical in real conditions.  On the coffee breaks and on the sidelines, only you could hear: ‚Äúguys, why don't you start training cyber-policemen?‚Äù <br><br>  We also believe that our mission, the promotion of ethical hacking, was launched and we will continue to carry it not only at HackIT 2016, but we are ready to allocate grants for finding vulnerabilities in various systems. <br><br>  Thanks to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/cyberalibi/" class="user_link">CyberAlibi</a> for providing interesting materials and cases. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270163/</a></p>
