Why did a great advertisement with a photo of your director on the background of the globe not bring a single call from those interested in your services?  The principle of fishing with a bait will help us to understand how to make effective advertising. <br><br>  <i>The goal of the angler is to catch a fish.</i>  <i>The goals of the fish do not matter, the main thing is that it often does not mind eating.</i> <br><br>  How should a fisherman behave so that the fish will be on his hook? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing to remember is that the seller and the buyer have completely different goals.  The seller is looking for someone to sell their goods, and as expensive as possible, and the potential buyer may not want to buy anything at all, even with money and interest in the product.  Given the normal human unwillingness to part with money, it is not at all clear what many merchants are earning.  But everything falls into place if we understand that the seller should not rely on luck, but rather push her potential customers to the purchase.  In general, the relationship of the seller and the buyer can be described as the relationship of angler and fish.  It will focus on some fishing techniques in advertising.

      <strong>Choosing a fish</strong> <br>  Before you go fishing, the fisherman should decide what kind of fish he is going to catch.  It depends on where he goes and what equipment he uses.  In advertising, this stage is called the definition of the target audience.  First you need to select the group of people among whom you will sell your product.  Here you need maximum sanity. <br>  For example, many would like to sell Chinese fakes Rolex to the richest people of the country under the guise of real.  But common sense will tell you that, most likely, your target audience is not rich, but ambitious men of active age 25-45 years, who consider expensive watches to be an important symbol of prestige.  It is very important to formulate as accurately as possible, almost to see with the inner eye of your most suitable buyer, in order to focus on this image when choosing tackles and bait.  It is important at this stage to investigate whether such fish is found in your area and whether its amount is worth attention - if there are few buyers for your goods, then the cost of advertising risks exceeding profits.  I really do not want this? <br><br>  <strong>Fish place</strong> <br>  One of the most difficult tasks of a fisher is to find the very place where the necessary fish is found.  The same difficulty is when choosing a way to contact your potential buyers.  Strictly speaking, the target audience is inseparable from the method of addressing it - wanting to catch sea sturgeon is senseless to fish in a freshwater lake, but if you live near a good lake, then why do you need sea sturgeon, because in the lake there may be a lot of other good fish.  In our case, with the pseudo-Rollex, you should consider a glossy men's magazine with the theme ‚Äúwhat is cool now and how to keep up with fashion‚Äù as a platform for advertising. <br><br>  <strong>Lure</strong> <br>  Every fisherman knows that even in a good place, the fish may be small, and so that at the time of fishing there are more, you should feed the fish in this place.  In advertising for bait used free or preferential distribution of goods or gifts to a limited number of buyers.  It is enough to indicate that the first buyers receive an exclusive discount or a valuable prize, and such an announcement is already ready for bait.  However, from greed, this method is increasingly turning into a teaser - sometimes the TV buyer gets a TV program newspaper in addition, but is this a sufficient incentive to buy a TV in this particular place?  I recommend to lure not very sparingly, and then, perhaps, your first hundred buyers will try to become several thousand.  Prikormke also includes all types of loyalty programs, seasonal sales and discount systems. <br><br>  <strong>Mormyshka</strong> <br>  The most offensive for fish is the moment when, after swallowing a fly, the fish feels that it is a fake.  For the fisherman, there is no problem in this, just to catch the catch, but deceived buyers are more dangerous for business than fish who are offended by the angler.  Therefore, advertising mormyshki should not give a reason for insults.  The classic mormyshkami include shares "look under the lid" and the lottery.  Additional incentive to purchase may be coverage of intermediate results in the media.  So, if in the course of the action, buyers see on TV the shining faces of the lucky ones, then the excitement can support the increased sales right up to the end of the action.  Mormyshki is the highest aerobatics of advertising campaigns and usually serve to raise already high sales, and in the sphere of small and medium business their use is not always effective. <br><br>  <strong>Bait</strong> <br>  When choosing a bait, the fisherman acts blindly - he does not try worms and maggots, and he does not try to ask the fish.  It is also meaningless for a fisherman to imagine himself as the required fish - what good can one decide that a crucian will bite on a pickled cucumber and a bottle of good vodka.  The real bait is not the one that seemed beautiful to the angler or fish, but the one to which the fish bite.  The same principle should be followed in advertising - no need to present yourself as a buyer, no need to ask what he likes - you should be given an opportunity to try.  If it worked, then the bait was chosen correctly.  This method of checking bait is called the method of focus groups.  Advertising bait should be the one that will force an indifferent person from your target audience to accept your advertising message and buy though, was going to pass by.  In our case, with the sale of copies of expensive watches, you can use the image of a young man of 30 years old in a good suit in an embrace with a top model and a favorable angle of expensive watches on your arm as a bait in advertising.  As an enhancement of the effect, you can put them in an expensive car with an open top - the girl behind the wheel, and spice up this dish with a large slogan ‚ÄúRolllex - your pass to the big leagues.  They will not know that you paid only 29.99. " <br><br>  <strong>The fish do not understand the requests</strong> <br>  How do you look at the angler who, instead of bait, hooks a note ‚Äúswim up and catch‚Äù?  The same is an advertisement of the type ‚ÄúAlfonso shop‚Äù.  A wide range of men's clothing.  Come and buy it! ‚Äù  Such advertising is ineffective because the seller who made this ad thought about himself, and not about the buyer.  The expression "wide range" will not attract the buyer, because it does not express anything concrete, and the bait must be direct, concrete and attractive.  The seller should think about the fact that his buyer really wants to get from the goods - his function, his dream, calm, confidence, or something else.  As long as taking care of hunger and food preferences of the fish will not be the main task of the angler, he will return home without a catch. <br>  How to make the previous ad "tasty"?  For example, like this: ‚ÄúAppearing for 3 minutes in the shirt‚Äú Alfonso Chikini 204 ‚Äùin the frame of the film‚Äú Casanova returns ‚ÄùPierce Brosnan won 500 thousand hearts.  This is your chance for only 49.99. "  Against the background of such an announcement, you can not talk about other products - the buyer will see them when he comes to be curious about what kind of magic shirt this is. <br><br>  <strong>Pickles</strong> <br>  To catch three different fish should take three fishing rods with different bait. <br>  When you are engaged in the sale of goods intended for different categories of clients, you should not invest everything in one ad unit.  It is better to make several ad units and place each of them in a place corresponding to its target audience.  This method is called market segmentation.  For example, your car dealership sells cars of all price categories.  This means that you will have to run at least three parallel advertising campaigns - one in each segment.  The advertising of budgetary small cars will go to a newspaper of private announcements, advertisements of the middle class cars will be placed in automotive publications, and business class cars will be advertised in prestigious business publications. <br><br>  <strong>Cut</strong> <br>  Do you think it is wise to cook the carp on the bait, but throw the bait into the pond where the carp may not appear at all?  An experienced fisherman finds out in advance which fish where to go, but beginning advertisers often do not adhere to this principle.  They rarely place their ad in a place where their target audience and does not smell.  For example, it is meaningless to place a car dealership advertisement on the handrails in social public transport - its passengers do not have money to buy a car, but in a taxi, such an advertisement can have an effect. <br><br>  Some advertising media have such wide coverage that it is impossible to predict the presence of the required target audience among their consumers.  This applies to entertainment and news media.  Their audience is so diverse that it may be too few related to your target audience, and you cannot even predict this.  If you have already decided to contact such advertising sites, then pay attention to two points - its audience should be really big and your ad should be on the page or in the program that is devoted to your topic. <br><br>  The narrower the media subject will be, the greater the number of their viewers will be able to become a consumer of thematic advertising.  There is even a special term ‚Äúconversion rate‚Äù - if there are 1 purchase per 100 ad views, then they say ‚Äúconversion rate was 1%‚Äù.  This number depends on two factors - on the competitiveness of your proposal and on the choice of advertising medium.  If an ad in a 40-thousand newspaper gave you only 2 calls (conversion 0.005%), think that you considered it bad - the target audience, the attractiveness of the announcement or the wrong choice of newspaper. <br><br>  Another common mistake is an excessive amount of detail that dispels the attention of the audience.  If more than three accents are placed in the ad unit or more than three products are indicated, then the number of customers will predictably decrease. <br>  The best option is a bright demonstration of one tempting offer. <br><br>  <i>Of course, this article does not cover all the features of the advertising business, but if you understand and master these methods, your advertising will stop causing losses.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3850/</a></p>
