It is worth noting that in some countries, data from other sources, for example, NewZOO, may differ significantly.  However, how exactly all these companies obtained their data remains unknown.

The revenue of the mobile games market for 2016 in them amounted to 27 billion dollars.  As a rule, in such studies, countries are united by region (North America, Asia, Europe, etc.), and it is for the regions as a whole that the revenue of the mobile games market is calculated.  We considered each country separately. <br><br>  In addition, in our rating we tried to take into account the costs for entering each market.  We calculated the cost of installing the application by all users and removed it from the total revenue in a particular country.  So we obtained data on the marginal profit from the market. <br><br>  <b>10 largest</b> mobile gaming <b>markets</b> (according to Statista): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/581/1c7/899/5811c7899ace42a5bd011fa6629c0267.png"><br><br>  Notes: <br><br><ol><li>  Data on revenue, ARPU and the number of players taken from Statista. </li><li>  CPI (Cost Per Install) data were obtained by Chartboost in November 2016 as average for Android and iOS users by country, reduced to 100% (excluding other platforms), except for the figures marked in green, Geenapp leads in January 2017 of the year. </li><li>  Data on the ratio of users of mobile OS published by StatCounter in November 2016. </li><li>  ARPU, marked in blue, in the future will fall, the rest grow at different speeds. </li></ol><br>  Thus, we have a <a href="https://allcorrectgames.ru/insights/mobile-game-market-index/">rating of mobile markets</a> by attractiveness for the developer, covering 49 countries.  Up to the 23rd position, the ranking in terms of revenue and profitability is the same, then there are differences.  This happens if mobile players in the country have low ARPU and high installation costs. <br><br>  In the first article we will focus on 10 markets, the most attractive for mobile developers, and tell you about their features. <br><br>  The 10 largest markets <b>generate 50‚Äì80% of</b> mobile game sales <b>revenue</b> .  For applications to gain popularity in these markets, they will have to be localized in 15 languages.  For localization in Chinese, you should use two variants of local letters.  And it would not hurt to take into account the differences between American and British English. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/739/9e8/794/7399e87945774df8b7aadf9bc7dc8f84.gif"><br><br><br>  <b>Interesting facts</b> about the mobile markets of these countries: <br><br><ul><li>  Most countries prefer Apple tablets. </li><li>  In Indonesia, the BlackBerry BBM messenger is distributed. </li><li>  To make the application popular in India, it needs to be translated into five languages. </li><li>  In order to enter the Android platform in China, it is advisable to negotiate with 20 (or at least 10) local Android markets. </li><li>  The strictest gaming legislation is in China, Germany and South Korea. </li><li>  Indonesia is the country with the largest number of people / citizens professing Islam. </li><li>  The Japanese prefer Twitter to all social networks. </li><li>  Hacking a game in South Korea is punishable by a fine of up to $ 43,000 or five years in prison. </li><li>  According to statistics, in 2015 in Indonesia spoke 707 languages, in India - at 454. </li></ul><br>  The most common localization languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor mobile games are encrypted using the abbreviation EFIGS + CJK.  The main language from which localization begins is English, followed by French, Italian, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. <br><br>  However, it looks like it's time to revise this list.  Localization of games into the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof 10 most promising countries will allow access to other markets (for example, Mexican Spanish will be understood by some US residents, and Bengali will be understood by natives of the People‚Äôs Republic of Bangladesh). <br><br>  Here are these <b>countries and localization languages</b> : <br><br><ol><li>  Chinese in simplified and traditional writing (982 million speakers). </li><li>  USA - English (US version). </li><li>  India - English, Hindi (650 million speakers, state language), Telugu (more than 89.7 million), Bengali (83 million in India, 215 million worldwide), Tamil (native to 66 million Indians, also one of the official Sri Lanka and Singapore), Kannada, the language of Bangalore - Indian "Silicon Valley" (more than 40.3 million). </li><li>  Japan - Japanese (127 million carriers). </li><li>  South Korea - Korean (78 million carriers). </li><li>  UK - English (UK). </li><li>  Mexico - Mexican Spanish (125 million carriers). </li><li>  Indonesia - Indonesian (about 20 million used in everyday life), Javanese (80-100 million), Sundanese (more than 27 million). </li><li>  France - French (79 million). </li><li>  Germany - German (105 million). </li></ol><br>  Mark Twain wrote that there are three types of lies: lies, blatant lies and statistics.  We hope that our alternative rating, on the contrary, will help game developers to better understand the situation on the market and make more money. <br><br>  Useful links: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/211/100/mobile-games/worldwide">Statista.</a>  <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/211/100/mobile-games/worldwide">Mobile Games</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/700740/Reports/Newzoo_Free_2016_Global_Games_Market_Report.pdf">Global Games Market Report 2016</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fresources.newzoo.com%252Fhubfs%252FReports%252FNewzoo_CGA_How_to_Compete_in_Mobile_Games.pdf">How to Compete in Mobile Games</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/trend-reports/newzoo-and-gmgc-release-the-mobile-games-whitebook-for-2017/">The GMGC Mobile Games Whitebook</a> . </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/327346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/327346/</a></p>
