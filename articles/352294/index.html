As most strategists know how to properly handle their work tools, a product manager must be able to tactically apply a roadmap and use the available services for this purpose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/530/fdb/f19/530fdbf19daa6213094cf971a1aaa581.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If earlier for these purposes they were treated with simple Excel or Powerpoint functions, then modern product managers can get real benefit and pleasure from working with high-quality tools for creating a roadmap. <br><br><h2>  Why do we need a road map? </h2><br>  The goal of the roadmap, as the main document of the product manager, is to convey the main ideas and progress in the tasks to the team members and external stakeholders (shareholders, customers, partners).

      The product roadmap consists of a global initiative and all its planned steps.  It should not include every feature of the product and detailed bug lists.  This strategic document is intended for separate planning. <br>  Be sure to update the roadmap of the product throughout its life cycle.  Included functions, initiatives and requirements should be created and initiated by many parties: management, customers, sales managers, partners, customer support, developers, financiers and, of course, products. <br><br>  Road maps are not limited to products: their goals are similar for different types (for example, marketing and IT roadmap). <br><br>  Any road map, focused on its audience, has its own characteristics. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Roadmaps for developers</b> usually focus on features, sprints, releases, and milestones.  They are rather short and, as a rule, more ambitious. </li><li>  <b>Roadmaps for sellers are</b> focused on combining features and benefits to customers. </li><li>  <b>External roadmaps</b> (for customers or partners) are focused on the main advantages of the product for them.  Like any external document, this kind of product roadmap must be attractive, visually understandable and accessible. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d02/a6c/b98/d02a6cb986b35f29e0ae3f8be54921c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also road maps differ in different teams.  For example, the roadmap in the Agile team will differ from the typical roadmap in Waterfall. <br><br><h3>  Differences road maps in Agile and Waterfall </h3><br><ul><li>  Waterfall teams are usually business oriented, based on financial metrics.  In Agile, goals are customer focused (for example, user growth and customer satisfaction). </li><li>  Waterfall road maps reflect completion within a year or two years, and the Agile roadmap usually reflects quarterly completions.  Planning at Waterfall and Agile also differs depending on the time frame. </li><li>  The differences are also related to the principle of interaction.  Interactions in Waterfall teams are consistent, and members of Agile teams work in accordance with cross-functionality and simultaneous actions. </li><li>  Finally, Waterfall roadmaps have limited flexibility, and Agile roadmaps are much more flexible, just like the methodology itself. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/981/4ce/7a3/9814ce7a3f592b4fb7858415a63fcb88.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is no perfect way to visually create a roadmap;  You can use different templates to display basic data: <br><br><ul><li>  Global strategic initiatives </li><li>  Releases by period (quarter) </li><li>  Detailed features </li><li>  Fix Bug Information </li></ul><br><h2>  How to create the perfect roadmap? </h2><br><h4>  Spreadsheets </h4><br>  One of the easiest ways to create a roadmap is to use spreadsheets.  For example, using Excel, you can compile product ideas, initiatives, set deadlines and deadlines.  They simply update. <br><br>  However, the road maps in the tables have significant drawbacks.  The tables do not have sufficient visualization and they are not enough to present a strategic plan.  In addition, the same Excel is a static document, which after sharing is difficult to control and synchronize versions with all team members. <br><br><h4>  Presentations </h4><br>  It is much easier to visualize a roadmap in software designed for creating presentations.  Here, the product manager has more options and freedom of action. <br>  But in this case, the presentation is a static document that requires manual updates, as well as a spreadsheet, which can create confusion with version control.  Ideally, the roadmap should be synchronously updated for all team members.  That is why today is becoming increasingly popular <a href="https://hygger.io/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%2520article%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Droadmaps">service for managing products</a> with the functionality to create roadmaps. <br><br><h4>  Why are special services better than simple ways to create a roadmap? </h4><br>  Product managers today have the opportunity to visualize roadmaps using the best management tools that help: <br><br><ul><li>  Visualize the product roadmap </li><li>  Link global strategy to roadmap processes </li><li>  Identify and evaluate ideas </li><li>  Collaborate with all stakeholders (including customers and non-technical colleagues) </li><li>  Integrate with third-party systems </li></ul><br>  Which service to choose?

Where to begin?  How to create a clear roadmap for everyone? <br><br><h3>  The main stages of creating a roadmap </h3><br>  Probably, there is no need to remind once again about the key business objectives that are directly related to the creation of roadmaps.  By clearly understanding them, as well as your initiatives in which you are going to invest, you can determine which features to add to your roadmap (thinking about what will have the greatest impact on your business).  Here is a 4-step strategy that will be useful to everyone: <br><br><h4>  1. Strategy definition </h4><br>  Global strategies are usually based on key objectives.  This overall vision of goals determines your forecast for the entire product.  A strong vision of the product is supported by the details related to your customers and their needs. <br>  It reflects the essence of what you want to receive.  Make sure your team understands everything at this stage in order to develop your future masterpiece. <br><br><h4>  2. Customization of releases </h4><br>  Here you select the functions that need to be highlighted, and decide whether internal or external data should be presented in each release or not.  Dates of external and internal releases may be different. <br><br><h4>  3. Prioritize features </h4><br>  Remember that customer requests should always be evaluated according to your strategy. <br>  There are various metrics that help evaluate your strategy.  It is not difficult to create your own scorecard for your type of product, since each product is something unique.  Having your evaluation map, you can objectively prioritize your roadmaps.  Keep in mind the general rules for setting priorities and known <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/hygger/blog/351238/">prioritization methodologies</a> . <br><br><h4>  4. Sharing a roadmap </h4><br>  Creating great products is impossible without communication, feedback and transparency of relationships.  Without them, can not do in your strategy. <br><br>  When you get the desired result, you can save it and share with interested parties.  With the help of product management software, you can easily share your roadmap by constantly updating them. <br><br><h4>  As a conclusion </h4><br>  Road maps seem to be becoming an indispensable and effective tool for management purposes.  They help manage team schedules, discussions, break down tasks into subtasks, complete work in a timely manner, measure performance, and achieve successful results. <br><br>  Well-designed roadmap software is a powerful strategic tool in product management. <br><br>  <i>What is your experience with using road maps?</i>  <i>Share your ideas and success stories.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352294/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352294/</a></p>
