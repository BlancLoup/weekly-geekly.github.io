Normal - PHP / MySQL, which thousands and which will be based on a couple dozen small sites ... <br><br>  I was looking for all sorts of hosting offices in Google, read hundreds of reviews on the forums, found ‚Äúblack‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite‚Äù lists, but people's opinions differed.  Then I decided to check myself <strike>who are the web</strike> hosting companies that I heard about the most. <br><br>  I made a list for myself and began to analyze the main parameters. <br>  I tried some myself, some just dropped it looking at ridiculous tariff plans.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>My conclusions and tips:</strong> <br><ol><li>  Almost all tariff plans do not suit me.  I do not want to pay extra money for mail, for I can link Google mail to my domain. <br></li><li>  I do not want to be limited in domain names. <br>  Imagine that one account is limited to three domains, and if I pay, for example, for a dedicated IP, then let it be tied to all my domains, I just feel sorry for the money for the second account, which I will have to pay for another IP, although you can was to use one. <br></li><li>  The option "turnkey tariff" is present in many hosters, but very often it is useless. <br>  For example, increasing the number of domains on one of the hosting sites I reviewed - ‚Äúplus one‚Äù domain cost me + $ 1.  What to pay for?  I do not understand. <br></li><li>  Carefully read the conditions (rules) hosting. <br>  Do not hammer and do not be lazy.  Usually, a ‚Äúrefund‚Äù within 30 days is the norm.  But there are all sorts of "magic" web hosting in which the rules stipulate that money from your account can not be returned. <br></li><li>  Pay attention to the quality of the caliper. <br>  Keep in mind that normal tech support will always connect you to an ‚Äúexotic‚Äù extension to PHP, etc.  If you already choose from a couple of hosters, be sure to look for feedback on the support. <br></li><li>  Check if there are affiliate programs. <br>  As experience has shown, sometimes you can advise a friend, give a link to one, another, and then the account completely lives with referrals.  A nice little thing, isn't it? <br></li><li>  <strong>Most importantly, the stone that I hit:</strong> <br>  Great importance is given to the figures of the permissible load on the server. <br>  This is the maximum percentage of CPU load, memory consumption, query execution time in the database. <br>  Thanks to these numbers, one of my accounts on one of the famous hosting sites lay for two weeks, after which I was removed. <br>  And all the sites were moved to another hosting, where they successfully work to this day. <br></li></ol><br><br>  For those who are interested, I will give examples of hosting on which I stopped: <br><br>  <strong>Jino.ru</strong> - slowly, cheaply, the caliper is good, it was they who blocked my acc.  But the second one is still working and I am partially satisfied, mainly with the price. <br><br>  <strong>Ruweb.ws</strong> - here I liked a cheap reseller.  I did it, took it and made a separate account for each of my site with its own settings and restrictions.  It turned out very comfortable and not expensive. <br><br>  I want to try another <strong>imhoster.net</strong> - they recently had an unlimited tariff.  If who tried it - share opinion. <br><br>  I do not impose on you, habrachelovek, the services of these companies, I want to help you avoid mistakes that I made. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83114/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83114/</a></p>
