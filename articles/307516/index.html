My experience suggests that when it comes to some kind of applied knowledge, it is much more useful to refer to short manuals from companies that are engaged in solving a particular task, and only then supplement them with reading more extensive literature.  For the last couple of years I have been using this approach in my work (and I often work on promoting various IT projects). <br><br>  There are a lot of interesting resources on my reading list (some of them are better known, some are not), so I decided to share it with the Habr audience. <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote><h4>  Books on marketing and content creation in Russian </h4></blockquote><br><h5>  1) <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/rockinrobin/RockinRobin_Editors_Howto.pdf">Editor's tips: how to create interesting texts</a> , Alexander Lashkov, Dmitry Kabanov (Rockin'Robin) </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e1/168/c52/7e1168c529ff472a803c6960d47a0188.jpg">

      This book, written by famous Russian journalists and the founders of their own company, is intended for people who would like to make writing texts their profession.  Content marketers, copywriters, journalists, editors - everyone who is on duty or plans to start working with text will find something useful for themselves.  The book examines common mistakes on the example of real situations, and also gives recommendations on how to avoid them. <br><br>  Quote from the book: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúA well-chosen title solves several problems at once: it attracts the attention of the audience, helps to build the structure of the material and form the necessary perception of the text.  This can be achieved using simple rules for creating headings, including the use of numbers, quotations and explanations. ‚Äù </blockquote><hr><br><h5>  2) <a href="http://texterra.ru/upload/img/e-book-100-prakticheskikh-khakov-dlya-internet-marketologov.pdf">100+ practical hacks for internet marketers</a> , Evgeny Kryukov (Texterra) </h5><br>  On the pages of the book, almost every example is not just a theoretical argument, but the result of personal testing.  Even internet marketing experts will be able to find something new in it.  According to the author, the book is so full of useful tips that it will take at least a year to implement them. <br><br>  Quote from the book: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúTechnique‚Äù a skyscraper is one of my most effective ways to create viral content.  The essence of the technique is very simple - on the websites of competitors, you need to find materials that caused a good response from the audience (scored a large number of rassharivaniy and comments), copy their idea, but implement ten times better. </blockquote><hr><br><h5>  3) <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/rockinrobin/RockinRobin_The_Book.pdf">How to use content for business promotion</a> , Alexander Lashkov and Dmitry Kabanov (Rockin'Robin) </h5><br>  Content marketing is a young discipline (especially on the Runet), and therefore the problem of a lack of information on how to use this tool in specific situations is more urgent than ever.  This book covers the main issues that arise for marketers, PR-specialists and business owners when it comes to content promotion.  The main focus is on the problems faced by IT companies and start-ups, however, in general, the proposed solutions scale well to other industries. <br><br>  Quote from the book: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúA great way of content promotion is not only the publication of some expert materials designed for professionals, but also various tutorials, lessons and help pages for beginners.  People who are not professionals in any subject will be very grateful to the company that will explain to them how to solve this or that problem. ‚Äù </blockquote><hr><br><h5>  4) <a href="https://bookmate.com/books/JcutVzuo">Content Marketing Management</a> , Joe Pulitzi, Robert Rose </h5><br>  Recognized worldwide content marketing experts Robert Rose and Joe Pulitstsi joined forces to answer the question: where do you need to send resources to develop an effective content marketing plan, and how to make it work 100%.  The book presents theoretical knowledge and practical methods of organizing the process of creating such content, which will help any business not only to get to customers, but also to form an army of loyal supporters. <br><br>  Quote from the book: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúSupporters must be supported, taken care of, and ... get rid of them in time.  Fan communities are like liquid.  They increase in volume, shrink, connect with others and disappear.  Be sure to pay attention to the changes taking place - constant monitoring of the fan community helps to achieve success. ‚Äù </blockquote><hr><br><h5>  5) <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/book-apart/elements-content-strategy/">Content Strategy Basics</a> , Erin Kissain </h5><br>  Erin Kissain talks in detail about how to create the right content.

The content will be all the more relevant if it helps them to feel like superheroes performing a particularly important task.  Perfect content gives users everything they need, when they need it, and in the most appropriate form. ‚Äù </blockquote><hr><br><h5>  6) <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/paperbook/launch/">Content marketing.</a>  <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/paperbook/launch/">New methods of attracting customers in the Internet era</a> , Michael Stelzner </h5><br>  The book describes in detail how to create unforgettable content and how to use the possibilities of social media to increase loyalty.

The main thing - to give, not expecting anything in return.  No one is obliged to answer you the same if you gave a gift.  But if you give good gifts, people will not remain indifferent. ‚Äù </blockquote><hr><br><blockquote><h4>  Project management </h4></blockquote><br><h5>  7) <a href="https://bookmate.com/books/WBYJ2ssp">Deadline.</a>  <a href="https://bookmate.com/books/WBYJ2ssp">A novel about project management</a> , Tom DeMarco </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2e/eba/8c5/b2eeba8c5e834eca993be5e753d6581c.jpg"><br><br>  One of the most famous and unusual books on project management.  The basic elements of good management are formulated in a clear and competent language, and are presented in the unobtrusive form of a business novel.  An exciting plot will keep you in suspense until the very last page, and good examples will make you look at many familiar things from a different angle. <br><br>  Quote from the book: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúPeople always go for the heart, not the head.  They will never be with you simply because you are incredibly smart.  They follow you because they love you.  A big heart, like a house, makes any leader a true leader.  For the success of the project, trust and warm relations within the team are needed. ‚Äù </blockquote><hr><br><h5>  8) <a href="http://adm-lib.ru/books/10/Gibkie-metodologii.pdf">Flexible project and product management</a> , Boris Wolfson </h5><br>  Easy to read and useful book.

Of course, my list is far from complete, but I will be glad if he helps someone to solve at least a small working task. <br><br>  And, of course, I will be glad if in the comments you will leave links to other useful books resources - this way it will be possible to compile a more complete and up-to-date list. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307516/</a></p>
