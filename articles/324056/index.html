So it was with us, a tandem of two people who would like to know the world of game development from the inside. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unfortunately, we have no opportunity to join the already existing team that would develop games, but there is a desire.  We did not have a way out, it means that it was decided, we must do everything on our own.  Of course, the path of people who have experience in the development of zero, and in general in this area, is very thorny.  However, the dream has the ability to push a person to action, what happened to us. <br><br>  Looking ahead, I immediately want to say that we have not done much yet.  Slowly but surely, we are moving towards our goal, performing small tasks daily.  There are only two of us, there is not much free time, but it is all dedicated to a cause that has already managed to catch the fancy. <br><br><blockquote>  Programming is breaking up something big and impossible into something small and very real. </blockquote><br><h3>  Step 1. To decide </h3><br>  The first step is the hardest one.  It was difficult for us to understand where to start, Many would begin to say that we need to ‚Äúread books‚Äù, ‚Äúget acquainted with the theory‚Äù and so on, but we didn‚Äôt want to wait, so why do we have to go to the pool, but with our heads.  For a start, it was necessary to determine the type of game.  Initially, we did not want to shoulder a huge burden in the form of beautiful graphics, real physics and unrealistically huge worlds, so we settled on a 2d platform.  It seemed to us (and it seems) a good choice to start and understand - is it interesting, is it possible?  We answered the first question right away - yes, very interesting.

      It is important to say that of the two of us, no one has anything to do with programming or any development at all, absolutely.  All that we can do for two is good drawing and good google. <br><br>  Choosing an engine for people like us turned out to be quite difficult.  Now the Internet offers a huge variety of tools for game development, a lot of different engines fell on our heads, so we had to figure it out.  Some of the most popular engines (Unreal Engine, Unity) disappeared immediately, because they are quite complex for beginners, and, as it seems to us, they are not exactly intended for what we want.  A little googling, found an interesting and easy-to-learn engine - GameMaker Studio.  The evolution of RPG Maker  ªa seemed at first glance quite simple to learn. <br><br>  So, soon all the points were placed above the corresponding letters: we make a 2D platformer on the GameMaker engine.  And then the first question arose: ‚Äúwhere do you begin?‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://pp.userapi.com/c836423/v836423058/29b59/39wJ3IbKuMk.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><h3>  Step 2. And where to start? </h3><br>  Of course, as creative people, we immediately wanted to come up with a name for our project.  Well, at least the working title.  And we chose ‚ÄúFjord Tale‚Äù.  Before that, we had already decided on an exemplary setting and time period (we don‚Äôt have the right to claim true historicity of what is happening) - the Viking Age.  We are both inspired by the history of the Vikings, legends and epics about them, so it was not difficult to decide.  Further - more, there are only two of us, so it was necessary to properly distribute duties.  The first is trying to master Pixel Art, the second (able to google) is starting to master the engine. <br><br>  Of course, the creation of the game needed to start correctly and it was necessary to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat we are doing and what needs to be done, so we drew up some plans and ideas that answered the questions posed.  (In general, management is very important in this situation, as it seems to me). <br><br><blockquote>  The most important thing in developing programs is to clearly represent the ultimate goal.  // B. Stroustrup </blockquote><br><h3>  What are we doing? </h3><br>  For us, the game seems to be some mixture of genres that we want to mix in equal measure: <br><br><ul><li>  Survival </li><li>  Adventure </li><li>  Development </li></ul><br>  You can safely say that all these genres have become very boring to the modern player, and also in pixel design.  However, as it seems to us, with the help of such an external design, we will be able to convey the atmosphere to the full extent as we want it.  As for the mixing of genres and their ‚Äúnovelty,‚Äù we want to take the best out of each to collect something amazing.  Of course, we cannot say that we are going to do something unique, because there are already quite popular projects that are similar to our idea.  However, the above three genres are fundamental to us, on which our project is based. <br><br>  We would like to make a difficult game, because the element of the need to survive in the game world seemed to us the most interesting, at the moment we decided to add several parameters that the player has to follow - hunger, thirst and endurance.  We understand that it is banal to the impossibility, however, in this area it is difficult to do something unique and ‚Äúinvent a bicycle‚Äù, because it has already been invented.  In general, I would like to establish several important systems for the game on the system of maintaining ‚Äúlife support‚Äù, but more on that later. <br><br><img src="https://pp.userapi.com/c836423/v836423058/29b74/0SXbGQY4JDI.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Part of the adventure gives us the opportunity to experience the flight of fantasy, come up with something and add a ‚Äúzest‚Äù to our game.  In total, we were able to identify the three most important "chips" in the adventure part of our game (very conceptually!): Character development, storyline and the ability to search.  To give the player the opportunity to develop his character is very important for us, as it adds a lot of difficulties.  We do not want to tie our character to the system ‚Äúkill - gain experience - become stronger‚Äù, this is all very hackneyed and, I think, very stupid and one-sided.  We want to give the opportunity to develop your character on your own - in the way the player would like, without tying him to levels alone.  We want to combine several ideas - the system and the need for crafting, wise spending of the character's needs (the need for endurance comes into play here), the ability to survive as a whole.  The main function of development in our game is not levels, but craft.  The storyline will also highlight our game on the background of similar ones, for us it is not just a brainchild to try to realize ourselves in game devs, but the opportunity to tell a story that we composed.  This is a real opportunity to get into a fairy tale, create it, and we do not want to miss this opportunity.  The ability to search is what we want the most.  It would be boring if the player was given a complete blank check from the start of the game, so we want to give the opportunity to search.  New recipes for the craft - you need to find, you also need to find colleagues, you want to get answers to questions - look!  Exploring the world - this is how we can fully tell the amazing story we are creating. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://pp.userapi.com/c836423/v836423058/29b4e/oME2dRAd9ZA.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Creation is another part that formed the basis of our concept, we want to give the opportunity to create.  If in many games the ‚Äúcenter of the universe‚Äù is the player himself, then we want the concentration of importance to be in the player‚Äôs ‚Äúrefuge‚Äù (we have not yet fully decided whether this will be a house or a whole village).  The need to develop the village, protect it and expand - another difficulty in the game, which will be a prerequisite in becoming a ‚Äúhero‚Äù of the new world of a bygone era. <br><br>  A few words about the plot.  It may seem trivial, but still: the main goal of the protagonist of the game is to find an artifact.  All this is done in the entourage of an amazing, exciting, ‚Äúnudging-to-accomplishment‚Äù Viking era, when the heroes of the epics grew up like mushrooms, skalds glorified the next returning leader.  Interspersed with good sense of humor, a lot of interesting, recreated from the myths, Elder and Younger Edda - this is all that we want to add to our fairy tale, to our world. <br><br><blockquote> At all times, the heroes themselves cultivated their own destiny. </blockquote><br><img src="https://pp.userapi.com/c836423/v836423058/29b6a/8i8ek1dzT1c.jpg" alt="image"><br><h3>  What have we done? </h3><br>  There is not much to write in this chapter, we have a lot of work - a cart and a small cart (and even more), we do not complain about it and with a smile meet this cart of affairs.  Now we are actively learning and practicing, improving our skills.  We already have some conceptual pixel drawings of some models, characters. <br><br>  There are already some blanks for the plot, although, of course, we are still very far from starting to implement it. <br><br>  From the point of view of the game itself, we were able to realize a full-fledged system of movements and already 90% implemented the battle system, which is a great achievement for us, although, of course, this is very little from what we are planning.  The fire is burning in us and we are not going to stop, the interest is becoming more and more heated as we work. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  We are not in a hurry.  But we have ambitious plans, we understand this and are aware that this will take a lot of time and effort.  Ahead of us are problems, times when there will be laziness, when desire is lost due to difficulties, but we are taking steps towards the realization of our idea, dream.  Yes, so far unsure, but in the minds of our beliefs and interests are firm, which allows us not to lower our noses.  We are players with a lot of ‚Äúplaying experience‚Äù and want to make a game that would meet our needs, and they are high. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324056/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324056/</a></p>
