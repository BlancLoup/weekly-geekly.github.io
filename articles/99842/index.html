We would like to bring to your attention your own view on the service of private ads on the Internet.  We tried to combine the existing technologies of private ads and online advertising.  Separately, the components of the project successfully work in the world wide web.  It is difficult to invent something new, but to adapt existing technologies to the needs of ordinary people, which are far from the Internet technologies, in our opinion, turned out well.  It has been successfully working on our <a href="http://www.krasnoznamensk.ru/">project</a> for over a year.  We are confident that for many owners of their own Internet resources the service will be useful and, last but not least, profitable.  We will be very grateful if you take some time and share your opinion. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Imagine a common situation - you have something to sell.  Offered to friends and acquaintances?  Not sold?  It happens.  A quarter of a century ago, all we had to do was place ads in newspapers or on pillars and entrances, but as time goes on and technology develops.  At the end of the 20th century, the Internet became available to us.  Bulletin boards and electronic auctions appeared.  For those who are more confident on their feet in the ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù, banner networks and contextual advertising have become available.  A decade has passed.  The Internet has appeared for many, but if a young mother needs to sell a stroller that has become unnecessary or the remaining pack of diapers, then it has become problematic again.  Free ‚Äúboards‚Äù and electronic auctions around the clock flooded with a large number of ads and robotic spam.  To increase efficiency, advertising aimed at a narrowly defined circle of people is increasingly required.  Advertisers have such a term - targeting (target. Target) - an advertising mechanism that allows you to select from the entire existing audience only the part that meets the specified criteria (target audience), and show the advertisement to her.  In this regard, many services allow, in addition to the subject of ads, to also select a settlement.  In many cases it helps, but in some cities and topics hundreds and even thousands of ads pass per hour.  Of course, there can be no talk of any effective sale with such a flow.  Such technology is no longer enough.  What turns out - these are all the possibilities that exist today?  Not thick somehow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d71/663/ee1/d71663ee1963cc151da0a686f572d7a3.png" alt="Bulletin board" align="right">  It would be effective to find any forum or bulletin board, which is geographically close to us and well visited by fellow villagers, which marketing monsters have not yet mastered.  For many ordinary people, far from the Internet technology, it is difficult to do.  You need to find a special site, find out what's what, register on it and this despite all that, many who need it spend time searching for familiar letters on the keyboard, and the question about the email address causes them a shock.  There are so many different sites on the network, but only a few can be used where there are forums or services for publishing ads, and the majority of owners of many other sites are not against their commercial exploitation.

      Really now, when 2010 is in the yard, newspapers and ads on pillars remain the only effective tool for ordinary people ?!  We hope not.  There are so many computers around us.  Let's still try to get them to work on something that is needed right here and now!  In essence, it is only a matter of offering a format that satisfies everyone and building a convenient service for this.  Create beautiful and simple technology.  In our opinion, it turned out so simple and convenient that it can completely change our views on online advertising!  The technology allows to solve most, if not all, of the problems described above.  Now you can easily place an ad on any site that supports our service.  Placing ads on visited and popular resources ensures their high efficiency.  People need it.  They do not need to look for specialized services and do not need to figure out how to work with them.  The reasonable cost of ads reliably eliminates spammers and serves as a good filter to limit the avalanche of publications. <br><br>  Let's try a few sentences to tell about how it works.  Suppose you are the owner of a popular site and would like to make it more interesting, useful, and also get additional income from it.  We suggest you go through a simple registration procedure in the <a href="http://addnow.ru/">addnow.ru</a> service, get the widget's html-code and place it on your website.  From this point on, the service of publishing paid private announcements starts working in your project.  It's time to go to the site settings and fine-tune it.  Here you can change the form of the widget, the color of the background and the text of ads, determine the period for publication of ads and their cost, add your own rules for visitors, as well as adjust several other parameters.  On the start page of the project we made a simple tool that allows you to quickly ‚Äútry on‚Äù one of the types of widgets to any site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d6/1ff/80e/2d61ff80e655023247a10500b87bf695.jpg" width="726" height="185"><br><br>  In order to get a very good income and start placing ads there is no need to have programming skills.  No need to register your company and customize work with payment systems.  In order to start receiving payments, you need to completely fill out a small form in your account.  According to our statistics, which was collected over a year, the service begins to work effectively with the number of unique visitors from 600 - 800 people per day.  We noticed that, on average, it takes about a month for visitors to get used to new opportunities.  The larger the widget, the more people like it and the more efficient it is.  Every one thousand ordinary daily visitors brings income from 500 to 1000 rubles per week. <br><br>  All this is very easy to use!  You can insert a picture in the ad, and the service itself will change its size as needed.  No picture?  No problem.  You can write a small text or specify a link to your site.  No need to think long about how it works, and deal with the registration.  Saw ads on the site - feel free to click the "place an ad."  To pay, simply send an SMS message with a simple text to a short phone number.  Is there a wallet in the WebMoney system?  Even better.  You do not need to pay a huge percentage of the adversaries of the cellular companies.  The cost of placing ads will be almost 2 times cheaper. <br><br>  Surely more than once they came across a situation where they saw an interesting promotional offer somewhere, but they didn‚Äôt find it again.  Banners and contextual advertising are in constant rotation.  Re-see the information of interest little chance.  Our system stores all ads.  It is necessary only approximately to remember when he was seen and view the history of publications. <br><br>  By placing ads, the visitor can be sure that it will be available for the entire specified period of time.  None of the ads will not be archived until the end of the publication period.  All ads are available on the site.  You do not need to pay either for shows or for transitions.  The time and popularity of the site is now working to its fullest.  They work not only for owners, but also for visitors.  Site owners are less interested in cheating counters.  For them, people are becoming more and more interesting.  This will definitely help to improve the quality of sites and materials on them. <br><br>  Service launched a few months ago.  Since that time, a large number of shortcomings have been eliminated.  Of course, we are still young and ask you to treat this with understanding.  <b>We would very much like to enter into a partnership agreement with some big one or two resources.</b>  This would allow in a short time to properly debug the work of the service.  In exchange for this, we are ready for some time to completely abandon our remuneration and respond as quickly as possible to the comments of our partners. <br><br>  Many efforts were made to make everything visual and convenient.  We would like to tell you a lot more.  We conducted research on the effectiveness of various ad services available on the Internet.  We have statistics on the effectiveness of different widget formats.  There are technical details that are desirable to take into account in the work and much, much more.  It all seems very important, but unfortunately, the size of the article becomes very large.  Be sure to try to do this in our subsequent publications.  If you have any problems or something is not clear - we will be happy to help and answer questions. <br><br>  With respect and hope for further cooperation, the team of the project "Ednau.ru". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99842/</a></p>
