  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 tips and tricks on eBay</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Nowadays, Internet commerce services are becoming increasingly popular.  And, probably, the most popular of these services - Ebay.  If a couple of years ago, many have never heard this word, now you can hear about Ebay even in the news. <br><br>  Indeed, sometimes a thing that can be ordered from America without any problems is worth in Russia many times or ten times more.  Plus, even in our time, many things in the retail networks of Russia and the CIS can not be found.  This is the reason for the popularity of this type of trade. <br><br>  Now online you can easily find a lot of guides on the process of registration and purchase at online auctions.  But even with such a large number of various guides after registration and even after a certain number of purchases, many still have questions for which answers are not so easy to find.  In this Mini-FAQ, on the example of the Ebay Internet auction, I would like to give answers and tips on 10 situations that are most often asked for help and which most often occur after you start using the service.  I‚Äôll say right away that these particular questions are selected on the example of personal experience and as you look at the questions on relevant forums. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, let's start. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      Let me remind you that I will not consider the process of registration / purchase / delivery, since there are a huge number of guides on these topics.  Also, perhaps, I missed some important points, in the future it will not be a problem to supplement. <br><br>  <b>1. Shipping Address</b> <br><br>  As many know, the delivery address is registered in two places: in PayPal and directly in Ebay.  Let me remind you that the address is best written in Latin letters.  Most sellers deliver to the address specified in PayPal, so make sure that the correct address is written there.  Crucial is the <i>destination country and the index</i> .  It is thanks to the index in your country that the parcel arrives at the necessary department, and the actual address is necessary in order for the postman / courier to bring the parcel / notification directly to you. <br><br>  Just as often, mainly among residents from the provinces, the question arises: is it better to write the address of the central or regional address in the delivery address?  I will answer: write the address of the district office, because  from the central office, the parcel will still be sent to your district office, and there is also a possibility that the parcel will not reach you at all. <br><br>  <b>2. Card Verification with PayPal</b> <br><br>  In most guides for registration with PayPal, it is written that after sending the confirmation code to activate a bank card, it is necessary to come to the bank in a couple of days and ask for an account statement.  Many do not know that there is a simpler option: <i>call the bank support service</i> and ask for 4 numbers from the comment to the last operation.  And this can be done not in two or three days, but in most cases, <i>a few minutes</i> after pressing a button in PayPal. <br><br>  <b>3. Sort Ebay Search Results</b> <br><br>  It would seem strange, but very many do not know that the search results in Ebay can be sorted based on the cost of delivery to your country.  To do this, just need in the right part of the table header with the results in the field <i>Sort to:</i> choose the option <i>Price + Shipping: Lowest First</i> and then choose your country. <br><br>  <b>4. The principle of accounting for auction rates</b> <br><br>  For many, it is unexpected that on Ebay is not quite the usual auction system rates.  The Ebay bidding system is built in such a way that when setting a bid, the system automatically makes you the leader if someone has not bet more than you, and the bid will in any case be equal to the Current bid + step of this auction.  Those.  you specify the maximum price you are willing to pay for the lot, and Ebay automatically calculates the auction leader.  In words it is quite difficult to explain this in an accessible language, so we will consider it with a simple example. <br><br>  The auction has begun, the starting price is $ 1, and the move is $ 0.5.  You have decided to put up for auction $ 30.  In this case, Ebay will take from you a rate equal to the current + step, i.e.  1 + 0.5 = 1.5 $.  In the event that no one except you is interested in this thing, then you will win it at a price of $ 1.5. <br>  Now consider the case that someone, seeing the current rate of $ 1.5, decided to put $ 20.  He bets, but you are still the leader, since your bet was $ 30.  In this case, the price of the lot will be set at $ 20.5.  If someone has bet more than your maximum, then you automatically lose the lead. <br><br>  The whole hitch is that you cannot reliably know what the maximum rate for this lot is at the moment.  To find out this bet, it will have to kill. <br><br>  <b>5. Think before you buy.</b> <br><br>  It is important to understand that Ebay is not a game.  All your actions at the auction should be conscious.  Before you buy a thing, carefully read its description, terms of delivery and additional information.  In case of non-payment you face <i>Strike</i> .  In case of repeated violation, your account will most likely be <i>blocked</i> .  In some cases, it is possible to do without a strike if it is possible to agree with the seller on the mutual cancellation of the purchase.  In this case, the best option would be to apologize to the seller and ask for a peaceful resolution of this situation.  Most often, sellers go to meet, but, again, it all depends on the person. <br><br>  Especially carefully read the description of the thing.  Descriptions on Ebay is a very important thing, because  according to the rules in the description must contain all reliable information about the product.  If the goods sent do not match the description, you will most likely be able to return the money for the buyer‚Äôs protection system, but the goods will have to be sent back to the seller, and you will incur considerable expenses, sometimes exceeding the cost of the thing itself.  For this reason, the description should be treated carefully. <br><br>  <b>6. Look at the reviews</b> <br><br>  Ebay has a review system.  Reviews - one of the most important indicators.  It is according to the seller‚Äôs reviews that it is often possible to determine how likely you are to get what you are buying and whether you‚Äôll get it at all. <br><br>  For reviews should be treated very carefully.  I would not buy goods from the seller, whose number of positive reviews is less than 95%.  It is worth looking not only at the percentage of positive reviews, but also at the reviews themselves.  First, the seller may have 1 positive feedback, while the percentage of positive will be 100%.  Secondly, there can be few or quite positive reviews, but all of them are left by people with zero reviews and for one-cent purchases.  This should be treated especially carefully if you buy a thing that other sellers cost much more. <br><br>  By setting reviews, treat the same with attention.  Sellers value their reputation very much, so they are ready to make various concessions in order not to get a negative review.  In this case, before submitting a negative review, it is imperative that you write to the seller in order to resolve the situation, whatever it is (other than outright fraud).  In most cases, the situation will be decided in your favor. <br><br>  <b>7. No shipping to your country</b> <br><br>  If the countries available for delivery do not have your country, then this does not always mean that the seller is not ready to deliver the item to you.  Carefully look at the description of the lot, most often, if the seller does not want to work with your country, he will write about it in the description of the thing.  In this case, write to the seller, with a request to send you a thing, a little sense.  In other cases, you can try to contact the seller.  In the case of his consent to send you a thing, you can buy this thing without paying it right away.  After the purchase, write to the seller with a request to send you an invoice for this thing, taking into account the cost of delivery.  Best of all, if the seller sends an invoice directly through ebay, and not directly to paypal, because  in case of problems, it will be easier to solve them.  After that, make an invoice payment and wait for your item. <br><br>  <b>8. Instead of an iPhone, a chocolate came</b> <br><br>  Sometimes there are situations that, instead of the expected thing, it does not come at all what you expect.  It can be as a chocolate, instead of an iPhone, or a brick, instead of an iron.  Therefore, I note here the special importance of opening a parcel (at the very least - a suspiciously packaged parcel, a parcel with traces of an autopsy, mint, bat, etc.) directly at the place of its receipt.  Only in this case you will be able with the representatives of the organization in which you received the parcel, to draw up an act of non-compliance of its contents and hope for a solution in your favor.  If you find a discrepancy when you come home, then your chances of making a claim tend to zero.  Forgery can occur at any stage: from an unscrupulous seller to your post office.  After drawing up the act will begin an investigation, after which, you will be notified of the results. <br><br>  <b>9. The parcel does not arrive for a long time.</b> <br><br>  I must say that lately this is a standard situation for Russia.  Due to problems in our mail and customs, the package can be expected for several months.  According to the rules of ebay, you can notify the service of the problem within 45 days after purchase.  During this time, a dispute opens in paypal and an investigation of the situation begins.  In detail about the system of disputes I will not tell.  Let me just say that the dispute about non-receipt should be opened at 42-43 day after payment.  In this case, it is advisable to write to the seller about the delivery problem for 30-40 days  The seller is likely to advise you to contact the post office.  In the case of Russia, it is practically useless to do it, because  at the post office, most likely, they will tell you to wait for the notice, refusing to look for something.  In this case, write to the seller that the parcel was not found at the post office, and then the seller will choose the best solution for himself.  As an example, he may suggest that you wait another, re-send the same thing, or return the money.  Many sellers will solve your problem before the opening of the dispute, or, in extreme cases, will offer to wait until the 60th day and then return the money in case of non-receipt of the parcel. <br><br>  I want to note that this should not be abused.  Of course, to get a refund, and then also the thing itself is very nice, but it is worth thinking about the seller.  After such cases, the sellers may no longer want to work with your country. <br><br>  The surest option is to receive the item, write to the seller about it and agree on the return of funds to the seller, more often than not, by buying the same thing without sending it to you.  The same should be done in case the seller sends you the item again, and both arrive in the end.  In this case, you can simply not take this thing from the post and it will return to the seller.  In this scenario, sellers will not accumulate negative emotions about buyers from this country, and they will be more willing to work with you. <br><br>  Just do not forget about the reviews.  Got a thing - left a positive review. <br><br>  <b>10. Auxiliary software</b> <br><br>  For ebay there is a certain amount of auxiliary software.  The most commonly used solutions are snipers and review review services. <br><br>  <i>Snipers</i> allow you to make a bid at the auction at the last moment and thus win the lot.  Actually, if auctions end at the time when you are asleep or can not participate in it yourself.  Sniper does not mean winning the auction, because  There are a lot of things that can prevent this.  Snipers will not advertise, they, in sufficient quantities can be found on the network. <br><br>  <i>Service review reviews</i> allows you to view reviews about the seller, highlighting a specific group of reviews.  Useful in order to see for what reasons sellers received and receive negative feedback and get ahead for themselves whether to contact them.  As an example, I can give the service <a href="http://www.toolhaus.org/">www.toolhaus.org</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90321/</a></p>
