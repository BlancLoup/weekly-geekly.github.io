So almost two years ago, I got the idea: "What if you gather people involved in solving interesting practical problems in design and invite them to share their experience with everyone who wants try your hand at designing interaction, graphic and information design? ‚ÄùThe company in which I work supported this idea.  4 excellent designers responded to the proposal to enter the jury and last autumn we held the first <a href="http://russiandesigncup.ru/">Russian Design Cup</a> .  In this post I will briefly talk about the results of 2012 and what awaits you this fall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a2f/8b7/bb8/a2f8b7bb88c81c1f025c9c7bb2d68e2f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>2012 - everything is just beginning</b> <br><br><ul><li>  About 1000 people registered before the first round </li><li>  Passed the first round - 98 people </li><li>  The winners in the third round: Nikita Ivanov (Nizhny Novgorod), Alexander Revyako (Minsk), Vadim Rostotsky (Kiev). </li></ul>

      You can read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/146339/">about how it all began</a> , as well as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/146339/">reviews about the tournament and jury interviews</a> in last year‚Äôs articles. <br><br>  <b>Promotion for beginners, entertainment for professionals</b> <br><br>  It turned out that for novice designers participating in the <a href="http://russiandesigncup.ru/">RDC</a> is not only a chance to try their hand at interesting tasks, but most importantly - a way to create an unusual portfolio.  The winner of the RDC 2012, Nikita Ivanov, made a <a href="http://nickivanov.ru/job/">page</a> that helped him find an interesting job and move to Moscow.  Vadim Rostotsky, who took third place from Kiev, not only published his work in the <a href="http://rsttskyy.com/">portfolio</a> , but also laid out the icon created by him from the task at <a href="http://dribbble.com/rsttskyy">Dribble</a> , gaining a serious number of likes for a beginner in the opening.  We invited him to work with us, and the RDC 2013 is largely the fruit of his work.  For experienced designers, participating in the <a href="http://russiandesigncup.ru/">RDC</a> is a way to compare your level with others, air your brains and try yourself in completely different areas of design.  This year, the jury came up with an incredibly diverse tasks. <br><br>  <b>Changes to the contest site: open profiles and statistics by year</b> <br><br>  Last year it was not possible to see the profile of the participant, his work and place in the tournament on the contest website  Everything was very simple, and after the end of the competition, we uploaded work and tasks to Facebook.  This year, the system has gained new functionality, which I am very pleased to talk about. <br><ul><li>  Profiles of participants.  This year (and all subsequent) each participant will have their own profile.  In it, you can see the tasks and solutions, and give them a link. </li><li>  On the profile page, you can provide links to your accounts in social networks and Dribble.  This will help you quickly log in, and also give visitors of your page the opportunity to contact you. </li><li>  At the end of each separate tour, in addition to the list of winners, pages of problems and decisions of all participants will be opened for the general public. </li><li>  Each solution has a separate page with Disqus comments and the ability to send a link to social networks. </li><li>  With an equal number of points above, the table will be the one who previously uploaded the work.  Therefore, a statistical module is connected to each tour.  You can monitor the download of solutions in real time and see the percentage of downloaded / solved tasks. </li><li>  The new competition system supports the competition every year.  Your profile will accumulate decisions and your personal statistics during all contests. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>How to evaluate the design</b> <br><br>  The design is very subjective, unlike programming.  Solutions to our problems cannot be automatically evaluated by the script or file size.  We will not be able to test every idea on users or conduct research.  Therefore, the evaluation of work in the <a href="http://russiandesigncup.ru/">RDC is</a> also subjective, and the relative balance can only be achieved by varying the composition of the jury.  Therefore, this year not only practicing designers and art directors, but also design teachers, heads of companies and one manager (by the way, a former designer) were included in the commission assessing the work.  They will evaluate the work on a five-point scale.  Each of them has its own expectations and understanding of what can be considered a good design.  If one looks more at the originality of the presentation and the freshness of the idea, then the other looks at the feasibility and system approach, the third is more important than the graphic side, and the fourth is in a hurry and is unlikely to read long text descriptions.  I agree, this adds some uncertainty, but in it I see beauty and intrigue. <br><br>  The winner of the competition will not be the one who is strongly ‚Äúpumped‚Äù in any particular area (for example, the master of icons with ‚Äúglass‚Äù highlights), but the one who accepts any challenge in any field of design.  Who quickly learns, finds the right information, thinks logically, understands the ‚Äúsufficiency‚Äù of the detail needed for a high score.  Such a person does not limit himself to the level of his competence and is ready for the new and the unexpected.  I am sure that among those who are reading these lines now there are many such people.  I would advise the jury to evaluate solutions as test tasks that their company gives to applicants, answering the question for themselves: ‚ÄúSuch a person would suit us, could he grow and be effective in our company, inspire with his ideas and define product design? ‚ÄúSuch an assessment, in my opinion, will be as honest as possible in a design competition. <br><br>  <b>Jury: practitioners, theorists and leaders</b> <br><br>  Now is the time to introduce our jury and ourselves as well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c9/2a3/429/7c92a34295302d483fd6bd2b2c437a0d.png" align="left"><br>  <b>Lena Dronova.</b>  Art director at Innova (online games and Ayyo movie service).
