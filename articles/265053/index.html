  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Old market or restored servers conquered the USA and Europe</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi, Habr!</b>  After our first <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/pc-administrator/blog/263283/">article</a> on refurbished servers, we received a huge feedback, a lot of interested people and a lot of questions.  What does it mean?  At a minimum, the topic is pretty hot.  That's why we decided to write another post, what the market of recovered servers represents today, and how much money such equipment saves.  So let's go! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/773/ca4/e99/773ca4e99e93426a9b00c120fe13ddcc.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b><font color="#008bc4">One of the main trends in Europe</font></b> </h4><br>  Refurbished servers are one of the fastest growing segments of the western IT market.  Moreover, both small companies and large companies, whose names are widely known, buy them.  Why? <br>  We will not go deep into this topic, since we talked a lot about it in the last article.  We will cite only three facts that make the restored technique so popular: <br><ul><li>  <b>Low price</b> - the restored server is on average 20-70% cheaper than a new one .; </li><li>  <b>High reliability</b> - when restoring everything is tested almost under extreme conditions, and the disputed elements in the system are replaced with new ones; </li><li>  <b>Warranty</b> - on recovered servers, as a rule, there may be a much longer warranty period.  For example, we can guarantee up to five years.  Even on entry-level servers there is a 3-year warranty, which vendors cannot boast about .. </li></ul><br>  Having studied the experience of Europe and the USA, <a href="http://pc-administrator.ru/">we</a> went further - <a href="http://pc-administrator.ru/">we</a> decide warranty cases on the territory of the customer.  This is the whole territory of Russia, Kazakhstan and the Republic of Belarus.  In the near future, our guarantee will be valid in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia.  At the moment we are looking for partners in these countries. <br>  As practice shows, it is warranty service on the client‚Äôs territory that is one of the reasons for purchasing branded equipment.  And now the brand restored.  The reason is investment protection. <br><br><h4>  <b><font color="#008bc4">Thanks to the crisis</font></b> </h4><br>  Despite the rather rather small age of the refurbished market (it dates back to the mid-1980s), a real jump on it occurred in 2008‚Äì2009.  Familiar dates?  That's right - this is a global economic crisis, which dealt a significant blow to the market in many countries and at the same time gave the necessary impetus to the growth of the secondary market, in which server equipment took one of the leading positions. <br><br>  In difficult times, many companies began to look for ways to save money.  And here the restored equipment loudly announced itself, and the servers are no exception.  After all, they are much cheaper than new ones, while also being reliable.  Then why overpay if there is no difference?

      Since then, this direction is growing by leaps and bounds.  Ten years ago, in the United States, it rested on the shoulders of several enthusiastic companies.  Today hundreds of companies work in this industry.  Their total staff is in the thousands of employees, and the turnover is in the billions of dollars.  According to IDC analysts for 2013, the US market for a used and restored IT technology exceeds $ 70 billion. <br>  However, better see for yourself and appreciate the scale.  Below are links to the websites of several leading American companies that are engaged in server recovery: <br>  <a href="http://www.itcreations.com/">www.itcreations.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.servermonkey.com/">www.servermonkey.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.deepdiscountservers.com/">www.deepdiscountservers.com</a> <br>  Shouldn't Americans learn how to cut costs and not lose in quality when the times are not the best for the economy? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b8/d86/2b3/2b8d862b383c429ab751b7b96ca8781d.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b><font color="#008bc4">How does this market work</font></b> </h4><br>  There is a large company that updates the server park and sells its old equipment.  The company, which is engaged in the restoration of technology, examines the proposed servers and their status.  If everything suits, then buys them. <br>  Then the fun begins - the recovery process.  It includes both a complete cleaning of the server and its checking ‚Äúwith passion‚Äù.  It takes place according to a special algorithm, within the framework of which it is tested and tested under a load close to real, ‚Äúcombat‚Äù conditions.  If weaknesses are identified, they are all eliminated, after which the server undergoes pre-sales training and is sent to the new owner. <br><br><h4>  <b><font color="#008bc4">But this is not the latest generation equipment ...</font></b> </h4><br>  We will not prevaricate - restored servers in 99% of cases are equipment of the previous or earlier generations. <br>  But tell me honestly - really, the server of the previous generation will not cope with your tasks?  In 95% of cases, it will cope effortlessly, even using far from all of its resources.  We keep in stock exactly those server models that are relevant today, weekly replenishing the park. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b73/1d7/f24/b731d7f240684905b5c1d44a43f051d8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b><font color="#008bc4">Billion savings</font></b> </h4><br>  Not only Americans have known the charm of the restored servers and other equipment.  Conservative Britons are on the front line here!  And here is just one small, but curious fact. <br><br>  A few years ago, the Chancellor of the Treasury of Great Britain, George Osborne, faced the task of reducing government spending.  And one of the areas where he found a huge resource for savings is government spending on IT.  On average, they are about 18 billion pounds per year. <br><br>  In the course of cost analysis, experimentation and consultation, it was found that these costs can be easily reduced by about 8 billion!  And absolutely without prejudice to national security and data integrity.  How? <br>  In most cases, instead of new servers and powerful computing complexes, it was decided to start purchasing refurbished equipment for state institutions. <br><br>  Although why go far for example.  Our company has done a great job of promoting and popularizing reconditioned server hardware in Russia.  As a result, among our clients: from small startups to large corporations, from entrepreneurs to government agencies. <br><br>  Since the crisis has confused all the cards, the latter are in a difficult situation.  Due to the sharp appreciation of the dollar, state institutions are forced to look for an alternative to purchasing new equipment.  And at this moment they find us.  According to our statistics, every eighth server request comes from a government agency, and this is very significant in the current economic conditions. <br><br>  On this, let's say goodbye. <br><br>  <i>And what is personally interesting for you to learn about the restored servers, their pros and cons?</i>  <i>Ask questions in the comments!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265053/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265053/</a></p>
