Well, let's see. <br><br><h4>  Past and future </h4><br>  Tuenti was founded in 2006 by a group of young Spanish students: Felix Ruiz, Zarin Dentzel, Kenny Bentley, Joaquin Ayusso de Paul and Adeyemi de Ajao. <br><br>  The network quickly gained popularity and on August 4, 2010 it was acquired by the largest cellular company Telefonica in Spain for 70 million euros.  Telefonica currently controls 85% of the company.  Nevertheless, Dentzel remained the CEO, and Bentley the lead programmer.

      Tuenti is a closed social network, which can only be accessed by a private invitation, in other words, the system of the most severe invite.  Moreover, each user is charged once a month with 10 invitations and, if he invites a spammer, the number of issued invitations for the next month is reduced.  Therefore, the Spaniards are carefully related to the choice of invitees, which reduces the number of spammers to almost zero. <br><br>  Tuenti in Spanish sounds like the English slang word "twenty".  In fact, the name comes from the Spanish phrase ‚ÄúTu enti‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúyour face‚Äù. <br><br>  The site is focused exclusively on the Spanish audience, however, as Dentzel recently stated, in 2012 the company plans to enter the South American market, that is, to expand its influence and fully occupy the Spanish-speaking sector.  Well, it will be interesting to watch this, it is quite possible that in the near future we will witness the birth of a ‚ÄúSpanish Facebook‚Äù. <br><br>  In a report from 2008, Google‚Äôs statistical service ranked Tuenti as the fourth site in the world in terms of user growth rate, and in 2009 Tuenti moved to third place in this ranking. <br><br>  An interesting article was published on the site shperk.ru, according to which 17,378,940 users visit the network every month, 4,700,000 users visit the site daily, and each of them, on average, views as many as 1,418 pages! <br><br><h4>  Interface </h4><br>  I do not know why, but in good social networks they often use shades of blue in design.  Tuenti was no exception, and, to date, its interface is a cross between Vkontakte and Facebook. <br><br>  There is a homepage, profile page, wall, posts, videos, public pages, apps and places. <br><br>  It is also noteworthy that Tuenti works in single-page mode, that is, after entering the site, a download line appears that loads all your pages, which makes their subsequent opening fast and efficient.  This download system is very similar to Google Mail mailing and every time it is pleased with the results. <br><br>  However, about everything in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Home page </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ff/ff7/734/9ffff7734071d42bfb90d5fb66e48651.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is absent from Vkontakte, and on Tuenti it shows the news of friends, groups and meetings (by the way, news of meetings, it‚Äôs really a very handy thing).  It also shows the profile statistics and the number of remaining invites. <br>  By the way, about invites, 10 invitations per month were originally given to you and, if you invited a spammer to the network, the system will penalize you and issue you 2 less primitives next month.  That is why there are almost no bots and spammers on Tuenti, and all the people behave decently and in a civilized way, which gives the network some amazing atmosphere of cordiality and positive. <br><br><h4>  User page </h4><br>  The page is very convenient and pleasant to the eye, since the number of services is strictly limited and fixed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60b/a0f/476/60ba0f476ab727dc6a3724f1407642f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You always see friends who are online, as the green circle lights up in the upper right corner of their avatar, and users who chose to hide their own page, as their avatar is clouded. <br><br>  Editing a profile takes place in the settings, it is completely standard and, in fact, is no different from Vkontakte. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca4/2b6/765/ca42b67656f0188af9084e94a7a5c753.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Wall </h4><br>  The wall is also not much different, but of the features it is worth noting that the subcomments to threads do not go from top to bottom, but bottom to top.  Plus, if you wrote on someone's wall, then the user's answer is displayed on yours (this is really very convenient).  You can have whole discussions in which, if you wish, any of your friends can get involved, both from your side and from your opponent's side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb8/11c/cc3/bb811ccc3c36441190276ae2fb0d4508.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  A photo </h4><br>  Photos are loaded in two ways.  selectively and with the help of a multiloader. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f3/834/df2/9f3834df25235f1e447ccaa9693a55ef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I do not know who borrowed the idea from anyone, but the fact remains. <br><br>  After the photos are uploaded, they can be decomposed into albums that look very stylish (left). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfb/d5b/c9b/dfbd5bc9b9ed5d55125c5a274879df47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Photos are viewed here in this mode: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/08f/751/ac2/08f751ac2ac8a9d3d5978a329ef1b5d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But if desired, they can be increased. <br><br><h4>  Audio </h4><br>  There is no music on Tuenti, but the quick-witted Spaniards found a way by uploading music covers to the network in video format. <br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br>  Just as Vkontakte is a huge music player for Russia, Tuenti performs the function of a giant video player for Spain, but Tuenti does not host video files. <br><br>  To add a video simply copy the link from YouTube.  Only from YouTube and exclusively from YouTube.  In this regard, this network is very convenient to search for multimedia information on interests. <br><br>  It should be noted video player Tuenti, which appeared much earlier than "Vkontakte" and is almost its full copy: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e1b/122/20f/e1b12220ff5f75184ae6de5e350e8191.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The minus of the player is the impossibility of dragging it from one part of the screen to another and, if desired, expanding and narrowing the window.  An invaluable advantage is the function of selecting the next and previous video. <br><br>  Also, the video can be viewed in the minimized and maximized modes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c06/81b/adb/c0681badbcc9b0f400e1a4b5b36db640.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Applications </h4><br>  Tuenti is a closed resource and therefore integration with third-party sites is completely irrelevant. <br>  So from the applications there are only games that are superbly grouped.  For example, there are filters by category (strategy, board, sports, adventure) and by type (games for one, games for two and games for a group of people). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a0/26d/04a/4a026d04ae575bdc5ebafe91bf7ae2c1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the left we can see three links.  These are ‚Äúmy games‚Äù, ‚Äúpopular games‚Äù and ‚Äúalerts‚Äù. <br><br>  As for the content, in essence these are the same games as ours, only with more expensive, beautiful, thoughtful graphics and in Spanish (optional English) language. <br><br><h4>  Groups </h4><br>  There are no groups on Tuenti!  There are only public pages that are very similar to ‚ÄúVkontakte‚Äù, the only difference is that they appeared 4 years earlier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/59d/ca0/469/59dca0469e6751a9498afb3c97482763.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I would like to draw attention to the structure of open public.  If in ‚ÄúVkontakte‚Äù they more resemble groups, then on Tuenti it is something completely special.  There almost does not feel like a guest;  By joining the community, you can upload photos and videos that are instantly discussed and any of your posts on the page will not be forgotten.  Warm friendly atmosphere, where there is absolutely no rudeness and negative. <br><br>  Generally striking Spanish style to choose groups.  They enter only where they are really interested in regularly showing their activity.  Our people basically enter hundreds of completely unnecessary groups for a tick, after which they never go there again. <br><br><h4>  Places and Meetings </h4><br>  These two services at Tuenti merged into one. <br>  With the help of Google maps, you can choose a place and make an appointment there <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/167/3b9/b72/1673b9b726611f8a4c9901ac21efcd6b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the meeting takes place, she goes into the category of the past, and anyone can note that he was in this place, but unfortunately not at this meeting. <br><br>  You can also select an already created place and offer to meet your friends there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d63/9a4/602/d639a46020316dbcd8061eb6311ae086.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The service is very convenient and facilitates live communication, and thanks to the Spanish cellular company, which holds a controlling stake in Tuenti, using the service through the phone costs a mere penny. <br><br><h4>  Messages and chat </h4><br>  The message system in Tuenti is fractional-interactive.  That is, all correspondence with an individual is divided into several parts, and the volume of each part depends on the number of replies to the original message.  The number of answers is indicated in brackets, for example: (Re: 6), (Re: 2), (Re: 11). <br><br>  Also on the left is a filter for selecting message threads based on initiative: ‚Äúincoming from friends‚Äù, ‚Äúoutgoing‚Äù and ‚Äúincoming not from friends and notifications‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/141/024/054/141024054040f99dcd863b73e7920530.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Arriving messages on Tuenti are shown like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/458/fa0/9f8/458fa09f87fa46535175ca7d46bb29ec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a chat on Tuenti, which is very similar to Facebook, but its convenience greatly exceeds it. <br>  Of the benefits - the function of video calling and PvP-games! <br><br>  For example, it is possible not only to use video chatting, but also to invite a friend to play a flash game for two, while corresponding with him.  And it really delivers a lot of pleasure! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/def/3ea/1ca/def3ea1ca55acaed4ce23f863deecc16.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  How and where to register? </h4><br>  For a long time I was looking for a person who would invite me to Tuenti ... A month later, I managed to get an invitation. <br><br>  And then I thought, probably, many people faced a similar problem. <br><br>  Therefore, to facilitate access to this social network, I created the <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/tuenti_com">Tuenti.com</a> community <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/tuenti_com">on Vkontakte</a> , where you can easily get an invite. <br>  I hope this helps someone. <br><br>  Currently, <a href="http://tuenti.com/">Tuenti is</a> actively developing, and I intend to keep you informed about the subsequent changes on this site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129918/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129918/</a></p>
