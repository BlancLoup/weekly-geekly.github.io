However, in-house, it's like freelancing.  Once you find yourself working in shorts for 4 nights around dirty dishes.  They began to look for outsourcing, to look in the direction of other technologies and projects.  In May, my wife and I were invited to ligaltech-hakaton in Kiev and, of course, I was very interested.  Wife lied, I have those excellent team.  We packed up and drove off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7bd/126/f05/7bd126f0576e4341a50e2c12c0f24912.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  While we were on the train, we thought which project we should go with.  They wanted to make a bot for tax deductions, but it seems like savings banks did it, and there is little profit there.  There was an idea to make a personal assistant in all legal matters, a kind of bridge between clients and legal exchanges.  As a result, we stopped at the system for automating the work of the m &amp; a lawyer of the venture fund.  So to say, and the task is interesting, and mvp will help the spouse at work, eliminating the routine and need for an assistant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/652/d10/f64/652d10f644fd4877bb5c9570c0787171.jpg">

      After walking around Kiev, they painted the MVP and went to bed.  Having cheered up Irish coffee in the morning, we went to the discovery.  Victory for me was not an end in itself, but I felt our superiority;) We are practitioners, with great experience, with experience in starting a business, attracting investments, and here are some students.  So I thought before the presentation of commands.  Self-esteem fell gradually, but confidently))) Those very ‚Äústudents‚Äù offered interesting products, I would love to join some of the teams myself.  The only thing that instilled in me a belief in success is our hard work.  Not everyone stands up for a day of work without sleep, and I occasionally arrange such shakes for myself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7d3/57b/797/7d357b7975eb401987d58929194708c7.jpg"><br><br>  3 people joined our project - 2 lawyers and a developer.  At first I thought that we did not need it, but I was greatly mistaken.  The guys took on the work of the presentation, part of the code and a lot of support.  Together I‚Äôm not at all sure that we would manage. <br><br>  As mvp, we decided to show the way of signing documents when attracting investments for a startup, templating them, inviting a lawyer or startup to fill out a questionnaire and upload a photo of our signatures.  By filling out the questionnaire and downloading the signature, the system itself generated docx contracts (NDA, dd, ts, etc.) with already signed and data.  This is only one of the tasks of the future system, but for the daily hackathon is quite suitable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e21/be2/433/e21be243368c4bc29567312d2b087e8f.jpg"><br><br>  Assigned backlog for kanban, there remained about 20 hours.  I figured that we would need about 3-4 hours to the front, set a couple of alarm clocks and we proceeded to the back end. <br><br>  Redbull poured, the code was wary.  Closer to the morning it became clear what we have time for, what we don‚Äôt have, what problems we faced and what we end up with.  We finished the backend, having realized 99% of the plans, it was 7 in the morning.  I set the alarm for an hour and lay down on the ottoman.  At 8 am, people began to push back to the site, and we sat down to the front.  We had a code for templating Vord documents, a small CV was written for searching and ‚Äúisolating‚Äù the caption from the photo, however, our template engine did not know how to insert pictures where we needed.  It was a little sad, but time passed and we decided not to be distracted by it.  We will show during the demonstration of MVP that we did it, but it will not arise in the finished document, sorry, but ok.  Thanks to Angulyar and Bootstrap - we quickly and quickly assigned the interface for both the foundation lawyer and the startup. <br><br>  Presentation 5 minutes.  And then the fun began. The guys showed good projects, good and different, close to the consumer, clearly closer than our b2b tool.  Here I began to get nervous, I understood that victory was not the main thing, but I wanted to win, of course) There were, of course, mistakes.  For example, one of the teams arrived with a ready project, which they honestly admitted. <br><br>  We looked at all the projects and the judges retired to discuss, the organizers rolled out the turntables and went on preparing for afterparty.  I was already sitting on treason, because  among other things, our train departed after 2 hours.  We did not get on after-party, but waited for the decision of respected judges. <br>  Iiii ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/257/00a/e74/25700ae747474fe69ae2c117eea5b3ee.jpg"><br><br>  As it turned out, we won with a good margin, which was very nice.  We received a small cash prize, respect and recognition) The money was divided among the team and quickly jumped to the station.  After a day and a half without sleep, we felt great on the train. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ced/1e9/a21/ced1e9a2186843e6b817a0afdae2af31.jpeg"><br><br>  After the hackathon in Kiev, we thought about the development of the ligaltech movement in Russia and in Moscow.  It turned out not so much, almost none.  We really liked the format, participation and participants.  Ligaltech from ‚Äúsome direction there‚Äù has become a very interesting vector for us. <br><br>  I wanted to spend my hackathon, but I had to declare myself in front of him, which we will do on August 30 at the first event of our ligaltech movement in Moscow.  We have already agreed with the top 3 law schools about the direct delivery of students, agreed with the media, found a plague platform for the event and are actively recruiting Central Asia for the first meeting.  The event is free, our task is to develop ligaltech, not instant profit.  Therefore, if someone finds it interesting to spend August 30 (Wednesday) in the company of like-minded people, discuss ligualtech, its future and find out our plans for the hackathon, write in a personal, I will answer everyone. <br><br>  Turning to the Kiev guys who are moving ligaltech there, I want to say thanks again!  You are all great fellows.  And what you do for ligalteha is priceless. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335626/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335626/</a></p>
