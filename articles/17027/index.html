      I have long been haunted by these questions.  It seems that the answers to them could clarify a lot of the motives of human actions.  I used the <a href="http://otvety.google.ru/otvety">Questions and Answers service</a> and asked it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of course, it was naive to believe that it would be possible to figure everything out right away, but, nevertheless, I got some funny results.  I will cite several interesting quotes in my opinion. <br><br>  <b>kotpes:</b> <br><blockquote>  Because people, performing routine work (actions) are thus hiding from changeable (and far from routine reality).  In the routine work they will not expect anything unexpected, something that they could not predict.  Uncertainty, instability frighten the average man in the street (even though it may bring some benefits).  Reward - people think that everything is under their control.  Why not get bored?  - no one wants to lose peace. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>simplyv:</b> <br><blockquote>  A great thing is a habit.  I loved games, puzzles that gave nothing but devastation.  As for the work, I do not like the routine, for me the revelation that someone loves it.  Maybe people love stability, clarity, and this leads to a routine. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>FAV:</b> <br><blockquote>  He took academician while studying.  At this time, got a job as an installer of radio equipment on the conveyor.  So when you get used to it - you don‚Äôt think about work - you can think about anything.  And I adapted to read, fixing the book on the ventilation.  At the same time, nobody pushes you, nothing strains you - I morally rested.  And skills - but I learned how to solder for life!  :) </blockquote><br><br>  <b>PureVirtual:</b> <br><blockquote>  I noticed a penchant for ‚Äúroutine‚Äù and I also didn‚Äôt really understand why you didn‚Äôt get tired of it, and why you like it.  For example, for several years I have been collecting electronic recordings of music that I like;  moreover, since at first there was a lot of marriage, I took it as a rule to listen carefully to everything before adding to the archive, and since I like order, I set up a system of standard naming of folders with albums and files, and of course tags ... and a neat record of each added album in ‚Äú database ‚Äùalong with related information (which was taken from relevant sources such as allmusic.com and discogs.com and manually placed in file names, etc.).  As a result, the whole procedure took about half an hour for one album (excluding auditions), and there were more than a thousand of them, which corresponds to about three working months with an eight-hour working day and twenty working days per month (no doubt that I actually spent much more time, just do not want to fool head).  And so I spent hundreds of hours on monotonous romp with sound files, but for some reason I never got tired.  I enjoyed spending all my free time on it, it was a rest, and it was also satisfying. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>morph:</b> <br><blockquote>  I often encounter the fact that a person engaged in the creative process is fairly easy to ruffle by simple routine actions.  Make him rename all the files in his folder, copy something for a certain period.  He will go into a stupor ... how is that?  Sometimes he just does not understand what they want from him.  He has one side of the brain disabled.  This is true.  True. <br><br>  Someone is aiming and doing routine collection, preservation, collecting, copying, repetition.  Someone on the contrary, does not see what is going on under their feet, invents, plays pranks, invents, creates ... <br><br>  Everyday life makes us periodically turn on or off one or another part of the brain.  You can read and solder, straighten cloves and dream. <br><br>  And we noticed how wonderful the ‚Äúspinal cord‚Äù passes, they are routine, toys (all sorts of Zums, Tetris and Arkanoid) when you don‚Äôt focus on them ... <br><br>  Rare individuals have a balanced mindset in which both halves are involved.  No, rather rare life situations force us to work with the whole head. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>chaturanga:</b> <br><blockquote>  Doing nothing is hard work.  Bored!  Yes, and realize yourself a slacker - not very happy.  And then a person who is not accustomed to intense mental (or physical) work finds, often subconsciously, the ability to do something, but not force his nature.  And in the case - and without the "torment".  This is a massive phenomenon.  Among such people there are even workaholics.  He will sit day and night over what is familiar and easy for him.  O. Henry has a story in which a certain aborigine WITH OBEDDY BARBED picked grass out between the plates.  Nobody needed this job.  But he felt that way.  Such a little self-deception.  I do the work!  Pay attention - many people even prefer watching films that have already managed to see.  New - difficult to perceive.  Man is not learned and not accustomed to think, to work on himself.  "The soul must work day and night."  Well, she does not like everybody.  It is easier to touch the paws, repeated movements ... <br></blockquote><br><br>  What do you think? <br><br>  Original on <a href="http://www.puzzled.ru/">www.puzzled.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17027/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17027/</a></p>
