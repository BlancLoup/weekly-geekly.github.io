    <h2>  The story of Easter eggs </h2><br>  It all started in 1979: Atari had a habit of not talking about the authors of the program, which programmers didn‚Äôt like very much.  Warren Robinette decided to correct this little mistake and hid the mention of himself inside the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_(1979)">Adventure</a> game, and getting a simple reward in the form of a secret room with the name of the developer was really difficult.  Firstly, it was necessary to play on the second or third difficulty level, secondly, for the development of Easter eggs, it was necessary to transfer the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù object (1x1 pixel) through the entire map to the secret room.  The entrance to it was blocked by a fake wall, which was completely ordinary and was no different from other walls, if you did not have an ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù pixel in the inventory. <br><br>  The real parent of Easter eggs, more or less familiar to us, was the Amiga company with its <a href="http://www.amigahistory.plus.com/messages.html">AmigaOS</a> operating system.  The fact is that many employees of the new company previously worked at Atari, and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúhidden‚Äù information was liked by software developers.  From the mention of their names, they turned to harmless jokes, insertions of references to their favorite cult characters and works, references to other products. <br><br><h2>  Easter Eggs in Google products </h2><br>  Of course, in the offices of Google around the world you can find a lot of developers, among whom it is not difficult to meet those still pranksters.  Below we have collected "jokes" working in the interface of our search engine. <br><br><h2>  Google search </h2><br>  <b>1. Do a barrel roll</b> <br><br><img src="http://lurkmore.so/images/2/2a/Barrelroll.gif" alt="image" align="right"><br><br>  ‚ÄúMake a barrel‚Äù is probably one of the most famous Internet memes: the original ‚Äúbarrel‚Äù belonged to the Star Fox game for the SNES platform, where this maneuver made the player‚Äôs fighter invulnerable for the duration of the animation roll barrel.  After transferring the game to Nintendo 64, she had new chips.  One of the characters was pretty annoyed by the regular ‚Äúmake a barrel!‚Äù Advice.  It was this perseverance and repeated repetition of one phrase and turned it into an Internet meme, which spread to other works: games, movies, and of Google search.  Actually, all that is required for Google to make a barrel is to <a href="http://goo.gl/8oNH9b">ask him</a> about it in the search box. <br><br>  <b>2. Tilt</b> <br>  By itself, "tilting" - not a drop of meme, but the request clearly <a href="http://goo.gl/3ThPYC">displays</a> what you were looking for. <br><br>  <b>3. blink HTML</b> <br>  At the time of modems and the slow Internet, CSS specifications were developed so-so, and there was no talk of any animation using stylesheets.  But there was a very annoying HTML blink tag that made the text blink.  Interestingly, CSS3 Animation is used to display this trick today, since the HTML tag is no longer supported by modern browsers.  To activate the surprise you need to "google" the <a href="http://goo.gl/3LgsCn">phrase</a> [blink html] or [blink tag]. <br><br>  <b>4. Atari Breakout</b> <br>  Another Easter egg, the source of which is a toy from the company Atari. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f05/469/8b5/f054698b5dc215f859b6014b781789e7.png"><br><br>  In this game and its various variations, reincarnations and reissues, perhaps, every adult (and not only adult) Internet player played.  Easter egg, associated with the destruction of multi-colored blocks <a href="http://goo.gl/w77nJw">hidden</a> in the search for pictures.  Just type Atari breakout and ... needles, 15 minutes have passed!  :) <br><br>  <b>5. Zerg Rush</b> <br>  Another ‚Äúgame‚Äù tab belongs to Blizzard and its brainchild - the StarCraft universe.  Blizzards themselves are very fond of Easter eggs in their games, and are almost champions in this area.  Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo are just crammed with references to each other and to other game universes, and MOBA Heroes of the Storm directly consists of combining completely different game worlds into one big arena. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/20b/e3d/b89/20be3db899d8289abafaa2fb714c8187.png"><br><br>  But today the post is not about Blizzard, so look at Google <a href="http://goo.gl/3TfzaK">Zerg Rush</a> and post your best results in the comments.  Good luck, although it will not help you, because the outcome is always the same.  Gg. <br><br>  <b>6. Recursion.</b> <br>  To understand <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3D%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%26hl%3Dru%26gl%3Dru">recursion</a> , you must first understand <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3D%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%26hl%3Dru%26gl%3Dru">recursion</a> . <br><br>  <b>7. Value Converter</b> <br>  As you know, Google is able to count and convert values ‚Äã‚Äãdirectly in the search line, in the same place you can build graphs and work with them.  In addition to the fact that Search knows [how many parrots are in a boa], it can also represent some convertible values ‚Äã‚Äãin the form of parrots, monkeys, boas and elephants.  For example, [the radius of the earth in monkeys] or [the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Red Square in square parrots]. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d8/e09/4ec/5d8e094ec11286e385cd901f6e4223cd.png"><br>  If you suddenly want to estimate [barrel in buckets] or [barrel in cubic arshins], feel free to enter such a query in the search box. <br><br>  <b>8. Cellular machine</b> <br>  What is life?  What are its laws?  Where did she come from?  Questions burning and exciting minds of philosophers and scientists for a couple of millennia.  In <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2596%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_(%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0)">Life</a> , invented by John Conway, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2596%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_(%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0)">game</a> , in fact, besides the description of conditions, there are only two rules, and what abundance of life forms are available to it.  You can observe the development of cellular civilization and take part in the creation of new life forms upon request [ <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3Dconway%2527s%2Bgame%2Bof%2Blife">conway's game of life</a> ]. <br><br><h2>  Google Maps and <a href="http://www.google.ru/intl/ru/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/">Street View</a> </h2><br>  In addition to numerous <a href="http://goo.gl/8LasmP">hunters</a> on Google Maps, becoming memes and "Easter eggs" on street panoramas, there is also quite official Easter eggs from the developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/88f/7e1/247/88f7e1247da553a85b8b9a076f5772ed.png"><br><br>  If you take a virtual walk to London and enter the correct phone booth, you can get to the TARDIS, the time machine and the spacecraft from the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580_%25D0%259A%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE">Doctor Who</a> series.  In the original work, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%2590%25D0%25A0%25D0%2594%25D0%2598%25D0%25A1">TARDIS</a> is a police telephone booth, but there are no such London booths, so the Easter eggs are hidden in a similar shape and purpose, but civilian. <br><br>  In addition to this thing, there are a lot of <a href="http://www.techhive.com/article/2010691/google-maps-hunters.html">interesting man-made and natural objects</a> on the maps and panoramas: some of them are left by the ‚Äúusers‚Äù of the service as jokes, some are just a lucky coincidence.  For search of interesting on panoramas and maps by <a href="http://googlesightseeing.com/streetviews/">amateurs a whole site has been created</a> .  There are still all sorts of unusual frames. <br><br><h2>  Google play </h2><br>  The web version of Google Play also hid the ‚ÄúEaster egg‚Äù from the developers.  Try clicking on the search button in <a href="https://play.google.com/store">any of the sections of the store</a> , without entering anything in the search <a href="https://play.google.com/store">box</a> .  ;) <br><br><h2>  Friendship is the miracle! </h2><br>  Believe in this phrase?  Then type Hangouts / ponystream and send a message. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fab/079/7a1/fab0797a175b322f0dece33b4d47e5f8.png"><br><br>  Your interlocutor will never guess how you are having fun in your free time from communication.  ;) <br><br>  Well, to surprise the other party using the desktop client, you can one of these commands: <br>  / ponies - one pony.  Ctrl + C =&gt; Ctrl + V =&gt; Enter, repeat as desired == many ponies. <br>  / pitchforks - forked torchlight procession <br>  / shydino - will launch shy dinosaur in chat <br>  / bikeshed - will paint the background in a random color <br><br>  We hid another surprise for birthdays.  Try sending the phrase ‚ÄúHappy Birthday!‚Äù To a friend in the Hangouts and see what happens. <br><br><h2>  Android </h2><br>  The most popular mobile operating system today simply could not do without the jokes of the developers.  To find the "Easter egg", go to Settings in the "About phone" section and quickly click on the line with the OS version several times. Depending on the software version, an interactive picture will appear regarding the name of the Android version installed on your device. what will happen then check for yourself. :) <br><br><h2>  Youtube: beam me up, Scotty! </h2><br>  Google‚Äôs video service didn‚Äôt do without an Easter egg, and it also belongs to one of the most popular and longest-playing TV shows.  Star Trek fans have already understood everything, and for the rest we will tell you more.  In Star Trek‚Äôs science-fiction series, there is a character called Montgomery Scott, engineer of the starship Enterprise.  His duties include the maintenance and operation of transporters.  So, the phrase "Beam Me Up Scotty" is the crown appeal of the captain of the starship Kirk to the engineer and means that he needs to be "transferred" from some place back to the board of the ship.  Enter [ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results%3Fsearch_query%3Dbeam%2Bme%2Bup%2Bscotty">Beam Me Up Scotty</a> ] in a YouTube search to feel like a hero of a galactic epic! <br><br><h2>  Easter eggs in other products </h2><br>  Do you know anything about Google better than us?  Found a secret from the developers that we did not mention?  Share it in the comments!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368451/</a></p>
