In this case, the range of the car from Honda, as promised by the developers, will be more than that of Mirai from Toyota. <br><br>  Honda will announce the price of its hydrogen car and the arrival of new items on sale at the Tokyo Motor Show, which opens on October 30.  It turns out that Honda will present its "hydrogen car" one year later than Toyota presented its own.  Previously, the company management has already announced that it will be selling a fuel cell electric car in March 2016. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So far it is known that a car that does not have a name yet will be able to drive about 700 kilometers on a single ‚Äúcharge‚Äù of hydrogen.  The number of seats in the cabin - five.  The power reserve of a Honda car is higher, since the batteries are placed more rationally than in a Toyota car.

      Now, many automakers are under constant pressure from the public and government officials who demand a reduction in harmful emissions from cars with an internal combustion engine.  This has become especially relevant now, after the management of Volkswagen AG recognized the use of software to lower emissions readings when vehicles undergo special tests. <br><br>  Last year, the company Honda has already announced the ongoing work to create a car with fuel cells.  But then the output of such a vehicle had to be postponed to improve its performance.  The current fuel cell array for Honda cars is 33% smaller than the previous version of the hydrogen car. <br><br>  By the way, at the beginning of this year, Toyota made an interesting move: the Japanese company <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2015/toyota-gives-away-patents-build-game-changing-car-future/">opened its 5680 patents</a> related to the energy of fuel cells for everyone.  This means that the technology provided can be used by anyone who wants, without paying royalties. <br><br>  The Toyota leadership believes that this will help bring the date for the exit of vehicles with fuel cells ‚Äúinto people‚Äù.  The company believes that the discovery of patents "will accelerate the metabolism of research."  It may well be that it will work, and other manufacturers will start their own research projects in this area, drawing on the experience and knowledge provided by Toyota.  In this case, the ecosystem of components and assemblies for fuel cell vehicles will be developed in a few years. <br><br>  Toyota understands that switching to ‚Äúhydrogen‚Äù cars is a matter of many years, even decades.  At the same time, the company does not doubt the correctness of such a transition. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368529/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368529/</a></p>
