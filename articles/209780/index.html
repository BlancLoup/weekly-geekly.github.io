  <section class="page js-page"><h1>jQuery Events from the inside</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article was written as part of a competition among students of the <a href="http://tech-mail.ru/">Mail.ru Technopark</a> . <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/289/cd5/5d2/289cd55d2150f57234e725e91969f4a8.png" alt="image"></div><br>  I think the jQuery java script library needs no introduction, but just in case, let me remind you that jQuery is designed to speed up development, provide syntax ‚Äúsugar‚Äù for native js, and save developers from cross-platform issues. <br>  Before we talk about how to handle events in jQuery, not to mention the event handling history in the browser. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Event handling on js</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Let's remember a little about the history of browsers.  The distant 90s were already going;  Internet Explorer was not yet the most common browser, but a Netscape Navigator rules ball.  It was the developers of Navigator who proposed the first event handling model on js (currently, this model is most often called the DOM Level 0 Event Model). <br><br><h5>  DOM Level 0 Event Model </h5><br>  This model is characterized by the following main factors: <br><ul><li>  A reference to the handler function is written directly to the property of the dom object.  The names of all events have the prefix ‚Äúon‚Äù - onclick, onload, etc. </li><li>  All event parameters are passed to the handler in the form of an Event Object as the first argument in all browsers except IE.  In it, the parameters are in window.event. </li><li>  Events can rise from the node at which they occur to the parent, then to the parent of the parent, and so on.  This process is commonly referred to as the ascent phase. </li><li>  It is not possible to install multiple handlers for a single event on an element. </li></ul><br>  The handler function can be assigned to the property of a DOM element both in the js script and directly in the HTML markup: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Script </th><th>  HTML </th></tr><tr><td><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span></span> element = <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">document</span></span>.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'id'</span></span>); element.onmousemove = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> (</span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">e</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">) </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">/* ‚Ä¶ */</span></span> };</code> </pre> </td><td><pre> <code class="html hljs xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">a</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag"> </span><span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-attr">onclick</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">=</span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">"return{'b-link':{}}"</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag"> &gt;</span></span>...<span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">a</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">body</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag"> </span><span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-attr">onresize</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">=</span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">"onBodyResize()"</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag"> &gt;</span></span>...<span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">body</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span></code> </pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  It is worth noting that, although this model was not standardized by the W3C, it is supported by all modern browsers (at least on the desktop).  And this model is still used.  Examples (HTML) are taken from yandex.ru and vk.com. <br>  The model is simple, like a penny, but life does not stand still ... <br><br><h5>  DOM Level 2 Event Model </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c48/c30/ae1/c48c30ae1a0409371b850804faac3bd0.png" alt="image"></div><br>  In 2000, the W3C released the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html">DOM Level 2 Event Model</a> specification, which can be characterized as follows: <br><ul><li>  installation of the handler using the addEventListener method (removal using removeEventListener); </li><li>  on prefix in event names is not used; </li><li>  Event Object is similar to DOM Level 0 Event Model; </li><li>  unlimited number of listeners of the same event on the element; </li><li>  ascent phase from DOM Level 0 Event Model; </li><li>  a capture phase is added, preceding the ascent, in which the event descends from the root element of the DOM tree down to the element in which the event occurred. </li></ul><br>  The registration method for processing has the following syntax addEventListener (eventType, listener, [useCapture = true]): <br><ul><li>  eventType - event type ('click', 'change', etc.); </li><li>  listener - reference to the handler function; </li><li>  useCapture is a Boolean variable that determines which phase we subscribe to (true - capture, false - ascent). </li></ul><br>  Then the subscription to change the size of the browser window is: <br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">window</span></span>.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'resize'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> (</span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">event</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">) </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">/* ‚Ä¶ */</span></span> });</code> </pre>

    <h5>  Internet Explorer Event Model </h5><br>  Developers from Microsoft have always gone their own way and before IE 9, the versions did not support the generally accepted event model, but they had their own, with <s>blackjack</s> atachEvent and detachEvent. <br>  This model is similar to the DOM Level 2 Event Model, but has a number of differences (there are many others, but these are the most basic): <br><ul><li>  attachEvent and detachEvent methods for installing and removing handlers, respectively; </li><li>  the prefix 'on' in the names of the events; </li><li>  no capture phase. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  Taking into account the differences between browsers is painfully painful, but not necessary!  We do not forget that we faced all these problems before us - in particular, this is why the jQuery library appeared. <br></div></div><br><h4>  Event handling with jQuery </h4><br>  Here and further, under jQuery, we will understand jQuery 1.10.2, the current version from branch 1.0. <br>  When we use jQuery, we can safely forget about the differences between addEventListener and attachEvent and much more, because the library provides the following for the developer: <br><ul><li>  unified way to register event handlers (using methods); </li><li>  unlimited number of handlers of the same event on the same element; </li><li>  passing the normalized Event Object to the handler. </li></ul><br>  So, in jQuery, there are many methods with which you can subscribe to event handling: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://api.jquery.com/bind/">bind</a> - sets the handler directly to the element (s).  Takes event name and callback as arguments; </li><li>  <a href="http://api.jquery.com/click/">click</a> , <a href="http://api.jquery.com/blur/">blur</a> , <a href="http://api.jquery.com/scroll/">scroll</a> and many other shortcut methods are similar to calling bind, only the type of the event is the name of the method itself; </li><li>  <a href="http://api.jquery.com/on/">on</a> is the main method that allows you to bind a handler directly to an element and delegate event handling;  for delegation, an optional selector parameter must be passed; </li><li>  <a href="http://api.jquery.com/delegate/">delegate</a> - alias for the on method with a modified set of arguments; </li><li>  <a href="http://api.jquery.com/one/">one</a> is the same as the on method, but the handler will only work when the event first occurs. </li></ul><br>  There are three ways to unsubscribe from the event: <a href="http://api.jquery.com/unbind/">unbind</a> (for bind, click and the like), <a href="http://api.jquery.com/undelegate/">undelegate</a> and <a href="http://api.jquery.com/off/">off</a> . <br>  But‚Ä¶ <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c2/8bb/111/6c28bb11125335a636c040ad3e05ea0e.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  jQuery is not only the abstraction level for us from addEventListener and attachEvent, and not only normalizes the Event Object. <br>  Under the hood, jQuery has a vast layer of code consisting of: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki%3FObserverPattern">Observer</a> design pattern that implements the logic of centralized installation / removal of event handlers; </li><li>  hooks and parameter filtering for the Event Object; </li><li>  as well as the possibility of extending the functionality of jQuery.event using the <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-extensions/">Special Event API</a> . </li></ul><br>  First things first. <br><br><h4>  jQuery.event </h4><br>  Many have already figured out how jQuery works from the inside (for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/164433/">here</a> ), but for some reason the event handling mechanism was bypassed.  So let's fill this gap. <br>  Event processing from the point of view of a library user goes through three stages: <br><ol><li>  setting an event handler ‚Äî calling the bind method, etc. </li><li>  event handling - all the magic that jQuery performs before the moment when it transfers the normalized Event Object to ‚Äúour‚Äù handler; </li><li>  deleting an event handler ‚Äî calling the unbind method, etc. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Special Event API </h5><br>  The jQuery library provides third-party code with the ability to influence the processing of events.  In the depths of the library is an object jQuery.event.special;  its keys are the names of events, the processing of which we want to intervene, and the value can be an object with the following properties: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-extensions/">noBubble</a> - a flag that determines whether an event should pop up when the trigger method is called.  The default is false (event pops up).  In the library itself, it is used for the <a href="">load</a> event so that the load event in the pictures does not pop up before the window. </li><li>  <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-extensions/">bindType, delegateType</a> (striing) allows you to change the type of event being processed.  For example, using this in jQuery, <a href="">mouseenter / mouseleave</a> events <a href="">are implemented</a> via standard mouseover / mouseout. </li><li>  <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-extensions/">The setup</a> function is called when a handler of this type is installed for the first time on an element. </li><li>  <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-extensions/">teardown</a> is called when the last handler of a given type is removed from an item. </li><li>  <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-extensions/">add</a> - the function is called whenever a handler is added. </li><li>  <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-extensions/">remove</a> is called whenever a handler is removed. </li><li>  <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-extensions/">The handle</a> will be called whenever an event occurs instead of the handler passed to the on method (or bind, one, etc.).  The use of this special-method is well presented on the <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-extensions/">official page</a> . </li></ul><br>  It is possible both to interfere with the mechanism of processing existing events and to create one‚Äôs own.  This is how you can create a pushy event that actually responds to the standard click: <br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">jQuery.event.special.pushy = { <span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-attr">bindType</span></span>: <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"click"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-attr">delegateType</span></span>: <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"click"</span></span> };</code> </pre><br>  In addition to the above, there are other possible properties, the purpose of which can be found on the corresponding <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-extensions/">page</a> . <br>  Later in the article, it will be shown at which moments jQuery transfers control to certain special-methods, and how exactly you can influence the course of event handling. <br><br><h5>  Install handler </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b7/f06/11b/3b7f0611bfbac387173e0ff6fe9c3ad2.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Let's imagine that we execute the code <pre> <code class="javascript hljs"> $(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'div'</span></span>).click(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> (</span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">e</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">) </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">/* ... */</span></span> });</code> </pre>  along with jQuery.  Let us examine what happens at each stage. <br>  <b>External handler</b> .  In order to handle the event, you must create a handler, get a link to it and pass it to any jQuery method that is responsible for installing the handler.  What we actually did was by creating a function using fucntion (e) {/ * ... * /} and calling the click method with it as a parameter. <br>  Methods bind, one, delegate, etc.  Our handler falls into one of these methods, inside of which, with a different set of parameters, the <a href="">on</a> method <a href="">is actually</a> . <br>  The <a href="">on</a> method consists of a solid set of if-else blocks ‚Äî processing and ordering of all possible options with which it can be invoked takes place.  It is also in the on method that the installation logic of the <a href="">once triggered handler</a> is implemented (the one method).  Finally, the method each is called for the current jQuery object. <br>  The <a href="">each</a> method is part of the jQuery core, it is with this method that the library is iterated over the ‚ÄújQuery set‚Äù (see <a href="http://api.jquery.com/Types/">here</a> ).  The each method can bypass arrays and objects depending on the interface provided.  If the object provides the length property, then the iteration is the same as for the array, which is an excellent example of micro-optimization.  So, for each DOM element from the jQuery set, the add method is called. <br>  All subsequent processing takes place in the <a href="">add</a> method (from the jQuery.event object).  At the beginning of each external handler is assigned a <a href="">unique identifier</a> .  For this (and not only) jQuery has a global jQuery.guid counter, which is incremented with each use. <br>  Then a function is created, which we will call the <a href="">main handler</a> hereinafter, which takes the Event Object as the input and calls the dispatch method. <br>  If the event handler of this event is set for the first time for this item, then a <a href="">handler queue</a> is created (all external handlers will be written to it) and special.setup is called if it is set for this type of event. <br>  Inside <b>special.setup, a</b> developer can implement his own logic for creating a main handler and subscribing to an event using addEventListener or attachEvent functions, or some other independent logic. <br>  Next, the main handler created by the main handler is subscribed to the required event using addEventListener or atachEvent methods depending on the browser, but this happens only if special.setup is not set or returned false. <br>  Control is then transferred to <b>special.add</b> , if specified.  Unlike special.setup, special.add is executed whenever a handler is being installed via jQuery. <br>  And after all this, the external handler passed at the very top enters the handler queue ( <a href="">link</a> ) and will be called when an event occurs.  About this further. <br><br><h5>  Event handling </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f2/1b5/af5/8f21b5af5ab27a448a6923acdb5b894a.png" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>event occurs</b> - the event occurs in the DOM element and falls into the <b>main handler</b> created by the library (it is subscribed to the event using addEventListener or attachEvent), in which the dispatch method is called. <br>  The <a href="">dispatch</a> method as the event parameter will receive the original unnormalized Event Object, which is passed to the <a href="">fix</a> method for normalization. <br>  Inside the fix method, <a href="">it is</a> checked <a href="">whether the Event Object is not ready</a> (if it has not been normalized before), and if not, then: <br><ul><li>  It is checked whether <a href="">fixHooks [type]</a> is <a href="">present</a> , where type is the type of event that occurred.  <b>fixHooks [type]</b> is an object that can have two properties: <ul><li>  props - an array of property names that must be copied from the original Event Object to the normalized one; </li><li>  filter is a function that normalizes (transforms) the parameters of an event. </li></ul></li><li>  If fixHooks of a certain type is present, then this object is used;  if not, then with the help of special <a href="">regexp it is</a> checked whether our event is key-event or mouse-event (each of these types has its own fixHooks - <a href="">keyHooks</a> and <a href="">mouseHooks,</a> respectively). </li><li>  Then a ‚Äúempty‚Äù normalized Event Object is created (using <a href="">new jQuery.Event</a> ), and all properties whose names are present in the jQuery.event.props and fixHooks.props arrays are <a href="">copied</a> from the original Event Object to the normalized one.  At the end of the fix method, the <a href="">filter</a> function is called if it is defined, and the normalized Event Object is returned back to dispatch. </li></ul><br>  Then <b>special.preDispatch</b> is called, depending on its result, further event handling may end (if preDispatch returns false). <br>  After that, for each handler from the queue that was created during the installation phase, <b>special.handler</b> is called, if it exists.  If not, then the handler is called directly by the <b>external handler</b> ( <a href="">link</a> ). <br>  At the end of the dispatch method, after all the handlers are triggered, <b>special.postDispatch</b> is called.  The special.postDispatch method can also be defined in its code, like other special methods. <br><br><h5>  Remove handler </h5><br>  Removing a handler goes through stages similar to stages from the installation, namely: deleting, starting, for example, with <b>unbind</b> , somehow gets into the <b>off</b> method, then jQuery iterates over the set with the help of <b>each</b> , and in the end it‚Äôs not the add method that is called but remove method (thanks, cap). <br>  In the <a href="">remove</a> method (from jQuery.event), operations are inverse to the add method: <br><ul><li>  Searches for an external handler in the handler queue by id.  Then the external handler is removed from the queue. </li><li>  If the queue is empty, it is also deleted, as well as the main handler using <a href="">jQuery.removeEvent</a> , which, in turn, is also a wrapper around removeEventListener and detachEvent. </li></ul><br>  You can influence the process of removing a handler by defining the <a href="">special.remove</a> and <a href="">special.teardown</a> functions.  remove is called whenever teardown is called when the queue is empty. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  We remembered how events were processed in the browser, what happened to the client js code when entering the jQuery arena, and what happens inside this library.  A single main handler for the element, the normalization of the Event Object through copying and filtering, a queue of event handlers, and a zoo of installation methods ‚Äî this is the implementation of the Observer pattern that the creators of jQuery presented us with. <br>  Overboard were at least such important for Event-s topics as delegation, preventDefault (), stopPropagation (), trigger and namespaces.  But only source can tell everyone.  So <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/">github is</a> waiting.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209780/</a></p>
