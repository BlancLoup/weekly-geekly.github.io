  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A little bit about VIM and IDE</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One, I have no doubt, a good man and vim-er with experience published <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339908/">an article today</a> that the regimes are a killer feature of vim.  Let me disagree and work as captain Obvious. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Vim is not an IDE </h3><br>  It is not overloaded with unnecessary functionality.  Seriously, IDE-people, how many percent of the functionality of your IDE do you use?  25-30%?  The VIM feature is here in a total configuration, and not only in a general sense, but also separately for each language / project.  You can download some plugins for c, others for js, others for go.  You can use four spaces in one project, and eight in the other.  Using different VIM configurations for each language \ project.  As was rightly noted in the comments to the previous article, this was not laid out in vim, but it happened. <br><br><h3>  IDE is also not vim, even with a plugin </h3><br>  Yes, language support and more convenient features for refactoring code and smoothing smoothies are more closely integrated into your IDE.  This is good, convenient and works, until someone has bothered to write an IDE for your language, or at least a plugin to support the language in which you write.  But imagine, for example, you mainly write in C ++, and it became necessary to look at the JAVA code.  Will you install a separate IDE or plugin?  In the case of vim, you simply open the code and ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù will get minimal language support (lights, folding of blocks, etc.) <br><br>  IDE is a good choice when you dig in 2-3 languages ‚Äã‚Äãand don't leave anywhere. <br>  In the comments to that article, it was repeatedly suggested to use the vim plugin.  A good idea if you decide to move from IDE to vim, but in the opposite direction it does not work well - you know the hot keys and Vim combinations, the vim configuration is ‚Äúlicked‚Äù by years of work, and it turns out that your config works a maximum of half that you have to combinations, which, as a rule, are not convenient, make ‚Äúraspaltsovki‚Äù on the keyboard and from time to time all the same pull the hand to the mouse.

          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
    <h3>  A little bit about the mouse, keyboard and VIM </h3><br>  Your config is ‚Äúlicked‚Äù and smooth, you perform all the necessary operations without even thinking about them, your fingers do everything themselves - this is how vim-er works with the experience.  Seriously, when I need to, for example, move the block of code by 2-3 indents to the right - my hands do it themselves, when they ask me how to do this in vim - I ‚Äúhang‚Äù for a few seconds trying to remember.  With IDE, personally, I did not succeed - I had to be distracted by the mouse, remember which menu was the right item, get to it. <br><br>  In vim, all operations are performed from the keyboard, and it is damn convenient.  The combination of vim + tmux + i3 and the mouse 99% of the time lying around, but this is a topic for a separate article.  What is the convenience of not giving up the mouse?  Starting from the banal lack of movement of the hand between the mouse and the keyboard, ending with the fact that it is really faster.  Type 2dw to delete two words faster than select them with the mouse and click Backspace \ Delete. <br><br><h3>  Modes </h3><br>  Modes are not a killer feature of vim, they are convenient, good, but, by and large, this is just one of two ways how to make the editor have rich functionality and be fully controlled from the keyboard.  The second path is the emacs path. <br><br><h3>  Prevalence </h3><br>  To know vim is necessary, if only because vim or its ancestor vi is on almost any * nix machine. <br>  Sometimes vim is the only way to fix configs on a remote machine. <br><br><h3>  Instead of conclusion </h3><br>  Vim is a good and convenient tool, but it requires pre-configuration. <br>  IDE - allows you to work with it, in most cases out of the box. <br>  Vim - Powerful and versatile tool. <br>  IDE - Powerful, but highly specialized tool <br>  Vim - supports more languages ‚Äã‚Äãthan you can remember <br>  IDE - supports 1-3 languages, but does it better than VIM <br><br>  If you still want to holivarit on Vim VS IDE, then do not forget - these are tools.  You can sculpt the good and eternal, even with the help of awk, the question of what to use is just a matter of convenience and habits. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339988/</a></p>
