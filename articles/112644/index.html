That is where, and what errors it detects.  This time under the hammer were examples that demonstrate the work with the library IPP 7.0 (Intel Performance Primitives Library).  I wanted to post this post on Intel at first, but then I decided that it would be quite ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Intel Parallel Studio 2011 includes the Performance Primitives Library.  This library includes a large number of primitives that allow you to create effective video and audio codecs, signal processing programs, image rendering mechanisms, archivers, and much more.  Naturally, it is not easy to work with such a library.  Therefore, Intel has produced a large number of demonstration programs based on this library.  You can get acquainted with the description of the examples and download them through the following links: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-integrated-performance-primitives-code-samples/">Code Samples for Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel IPP) Library</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://registrationcenter.intel.com/irc_nas/1908/get-ipp-samples-parallel-studio.htm">Intel Integrated Performance Primitives Library 7.0 Samples for Parallel Studio 2011</a> </li></ul><br>  All examples are divided into four groups: <br><ul><li>  IPP Samples for Windows </li><li>  IPP UIC Demo for Windows </li><li>  IPP DMIP Samples for Windows </li><li>  IPP Cryptography Samples for Windows </li></ul><br>  Each set contains a large number of projects, so for starters, I took for verification only the first set of IPP Samples for Windows.  I carried out the check using <a href="http://www.viva64.com/ru/pvs-studio/">PVS-Studio</a> version 4.10. <br><br>  With this post I want to show that static analysis is useful regardless of the professionalism of the programmers and the level of the solution being developed.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äútaking professionals and writing right away without mistakes‚Äù does not work.  Even highly skilled developers are not immune from errors and typos in the coding process.  The errors in the examples for IPP demonstrate this very well. <br><br>  I emphasize that IPP Samples for Windows is a high-quality project.  However, due to its size of 1.6 million lines of code, it inevitably contains a variety of errors.  Consider some of them.

    <h2>  Unsuccessful replacement of array indices </h2><br>  This example could have been a great addition to my previous article " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/complete_code/112276/">The consequences of using Copy-Paste technology when programming in C ++ and how to deal with it</a> ": <br><pre>  struct AVS_MB_INFO

 } </pre><br>  Diagnostic message of PVS-Studio: V557 Array overrun is possible.  The '30' index is pointing beyond array bound.  avs_enc umc_avs_enc_compressor_enc_b.cpp 495 <br><br>  The programmer copied the code fragment several times and changed the value of the array indices.  But at the very end, his hand shook.  He entered the number 3, but did not delete the number 0. As a result, an index of 30 is obtained and, when the code is executed, it will be accessed far beyond the array boundaries. <br><br><h2>  Same code branches </h2><br>  Once we started by copying the code, here‚Äôs another example on this topic: <br><pre>  AACStatus aacencGetFrame (...)

   ...
   if (maxEn [0]&gt; maxEn [1]) {
     ics [1] .num_window_groups = ics [0] .num_window_groups;

     }
   }
   ...
 } </pre><br>  PVS-Studio diagnostic message: V523 The 'then' statement is equivalent to the 'else' statement.  aac_enc aac_enc_api_fp.c 1379 <br><br>  But this time, on the contrary, they forgot to edit the copied code.  Both branches of the conditional ‚Äúif‚Äù operator perform the same actions. <br><br><h2>  Confusion with the priority of the decrement operation "-" and dereferencing the pointer "*" </h2><br><pre>  static void
 sbrencConflictResolution (..., Ipp32s * nLeftBord)
 {
   ...
   * nLeftBord = nBordNext - 1;
   ...
   if (* lenBordNext&gt; 1) {
     ...
     * nLeftBord--;
   }
   ...
 } </pre><br>  PVS-Studio diagnostic message: V532 Consider inspecting the statement of '* pointer--' pattern.  Probably meant: '(* pointer) -'.  aac_enc sbr_enc_frame_gen.c 428 <br><br>  The ‚ÄúnLeftBord‚Äù pointer uses the ‚ÄúsbrencConflictResolution‚Äù function to return a value from the function.  First, the value "nBordNext - 1" is written to the specified address.  Under certain conditions, this value should be reduced by one.  To decrease the value, the programmer used the following code: <br><pre>  * nLeftBord--; </pre><br>  The error is that instead of the value, the pointer itself is reduced.  The correct code should look like this: <br><pre>  (* nLeftBord) -; </pre><br><h2>  Even more confusing situation with the increment operation "++" and dereference of the pointer "*" </h2><br>  The following code is completely incomprehensible to me.  I do not know how to fix it so that it acquires meaning.  Perhaps something is missing here. <br><pre>  static IppStatus mp2_HuffmanTableInitAlloc (Ipp32s * tbl, ...)
 {
   ...
   for (i = 0; i &lt;num_tbl; i ++) {
     * tbl ++;
   }
   ...
 } </pre><br>  PVS-Studio diagnostic message: V532 Consider inspecting the statement of '* pointer ++' pattern.  Probably meant: '(* pointer) ++'.  mpeg2_dec umc_mpeg2_dec.cpp 59 <br><br>  Now, the loop in the example is equivalent to the following code: <br><pre>  tbl + = num_tbl; </pre><br>  The PVS-Studio analyzer suggested that perhaps the parentheses were forgotten and you should write "(* tbl) ++;".  But this code does not make sense.  Then the cycle will be equivalent: <br><pre>  * tbl + = num_tbl; </pre><br>  In general, a very strange kind of cycle.  There is an error, but only the author of the code can fix it. <br><br><h2>  Loss of symptom that an error has occurred </h2><br>  The code has a function "GetTrackByPidOrCreateNew", which returns the value "-1" if an error occurs. <br><pre>  typedef signed int Ipp32s;
 typedef unsigned int Ipp32u;

 Ipp32s StreamParser :: GetTrackByPidOrCreateNew (Ipp32s iPid, bool * pIsNew)
 {
   ...
   else if (! pIsNew || m_uiTracks&gt; = MAX_TRACK)
     return -1;
   ...
 } </pre><br>  With the function "GetTrackByPidOrCreateNew" everything is fine.  But there is an error when using it: <br><pre>  Status StreamParser :: GetNextData (MediaData * pData, Ipp32u * pTrack)
 {
   ...
   * pTrack = GetTrackByPidOrCreateNew (m_pPacket-&gt; iPid, NULL);

   if (* pTrack&gt; = 0 &amp;&amp; TRACK_LPCM == m_pInfo [* pTrack] -&gt; m_Type)
     ippsSwapBytes_16u_I ((Ipp16u *) pData-&gt; GetDataPointer (),
                         m_pPacket-&gt; uiSize / 2);
   ...
 } </pre><br>  PVS-Studio diagnostic message: V547 Expression '* pTrack&gt; = 0' is always true.  Unsigned type value is always&gt; = 0. demuxer umc_stream_parser.cpp 179 <br><br>  The value returned by the GetTrackByPidOrCreateNew function is stored in unsigned int format.  This means that "-1" will turn into "4294967295", and the condition "* pTrack&gt; = 0" is always true. <br><br>  As a result, if the function "GetTrackByPidOrCreateNew" returns the value "-1", then Access Violation will occur when executing the code "m_pInfo [* pTrack] -&gt; m_Type". <br><br><h2>  Copy-Paste and Forgotten +1 </h2><br><pre>  void H264SegmentDecoder :: ResetDeblockingVariablesMBAFF ()

The correct code should look like this: <br><pre>  if (GetMBFieldDecodingFlag (m_gmbinfo-&gt; mbs [m_CurMBAddr 
                                           - mb_width * 2]))

     m_CurMBAddr - mb_width * 2;
 else
   m_deblockingParams.nNeighbour [HORIZONTAL_DEBLOCKING] =
     m_CurMBAddr - mb_width * 2 + 1; </pre><br>  Not far away in the function ‚ÄúH264CoreEncoder_ResetDeblockingVariablesMBAFF‚Äù there is exactly the same error with the forgotten ‚Äú+ 1‚Äù. <br><br>  PVS-Studio diagnostic message: V523 The 'then' statement is equivalent to the 'else' statement.  h264_enc umc_h264_deblocking_mbaff_tmpl.cpp.h 366 <br><br><h2>  Remove, which removes nothing </h2><br><pre>  void H264ThreadGroup :: RemoveThread (H264Thread * thread)

On the one hand, everything is solid.  Used by mutex to correctly remove an element in a multi-threaded application.  On the other hand, it is banal to forget that the std :: remove function does not remove elements from an array, but only changes their order.  In fact, it should be written like this: <br><pre>  m_threads .erase (
   std :: remove (m_threads.begin (), m_threads.end (), thread),
   m_threads.end ()); </pre><br><h2>  Comparison of structure fields with yourself </h2><br>  I look at the errors and noticed that the implementation of the H264 video compression standard is kind of buggy.  This project includes a fairly large number of errors found.  For example, someone hurried while programming and used two incorrect variable names at once. <br><pre>  bool H264_AU_Stream :: IsPictureSame (H264SliceHeaderParse &amp; p_newHeader)

Unsigned type value is never &lt;0. vc1_enc umc_vc1_enc_planes.h 200 <br><br>  Incorrectly, the situation when the buffer size is insufficient for work is processed.  Instead of returning the error code, the program will continue to work and most likely will crash.  The fact is that the variable "memSize" is of type "unsigned int".  Therefore, the ‚ÄúmemSize &lt;0‚Äù condition is always false and we continue to work with an insufficiently sized buffer. <br><br>  This is probably a good example of the program‚Äôs vulnerability to attack.  Having slipped the incorrect data, you can overflow the buffer and try to use it.  By the way, there were about 10 such vulnerabilities.

Unsigned type value is never &lt;0. vc1_enc umc_vc1_enc_mb.cpp 188 <br><br>  The variable "m_iCurrMBIndex" is of type "unsigned".  Because of this, the expression "m_iCurrMBIndex - x" also has the type "unsigned".  Therefore, the condition "m_iCurrMBIndex - x &lt;0" is always false.  Consider the consequences. <br><br>  Let the variable "m_iCurrMBIndex" be 5, and the variable "x" be 10. <br><br>  The expression "m_iCurrMBIndex - x" is 5u - 10i = 0xFFFFFFFBu. <br><br>  The condition ‚Äúm_iCurrMBIndex - x &lt;0‚Äù is false. <br><br>  The expression ‚Äúm_MBInfo [row] [0xFFFFFFFBu]‚Äù is executed and the array is exceeded. <br><br><h2>  Error using ternary operator '?:'. </h2><br>  The ternary operator is dangerous enough because it is easy to make a mistake.

The '?:' Operator has a lower than the '|'  operator.  vm vm_file_win.c 393 <br><br>  The code must be a combination of the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL and FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING flags.  But in fact, the element "mds [3]" is always assigned the value 0. <br><br>  The programmer has forgotten that the operator priority is "|"  higher than the priority of the operator "?:".  It turns out that the following expression is written in the code (note the brackets): <br><br>  (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL | (islog == 0))? <br><br>  0: FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING; <br><br>  The condition "FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL |  (islog == 0) "is always true and we assign the value 0 to the element" mds [3] ". <br><br>  The correct expression should look like this (pay attention to the brackets again): <br><pre>  FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL |

I did not cite some mistakes, as they are twin brothers of the examples I reviewed in the article, and it will not be interesting to read about them.  I did not give here minor errors.  An example would be assert (), in which the condition is always true due to a typo.  I missed many parts of the code, because I just don‚Äôt know if this is a mistake or just plain ugly.  However, I think that the described defects are enough to show the difficulty of writing large projects, even by professional developers. <br><br>  Once again I will formulate the thought voiced at the beginning of the article.  Even a good programmer is not immune from typos, forgetfulness, the desire to make Copy-Paste and mistakes in logic.  I think, in the future, a link to this article will be a good answer for people who are sure that pronouncing the phrase ‚Äúyou must write the code correctly‚Äù will protect them from any mistakes. <br><br>  Good luck to everyone in your C / C ++ / C ++ 0x projects.  And I wish you to find more mistakes using the methodology of static analysis that I love so much. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112644/</a></p>
