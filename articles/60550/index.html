Start</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago in this blog on Habr√© my text <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/edu_2_0/59516/">"Help school sites!"</a> Was published.  Published @twangel, for which he thanks, he also helped to remember about the once registered account.  In that post, I promised to continue the topic of school sites.  I carry out. <br><br>  In the near future, I plan to publish in fragments a book the author of which I am (written in collaboration with Smirnova Z. Yu.).  The book "Creating a school site: from concept to realization I develop" was published in 2008 by the publishing company "September" in electronic (CD) and paper format.  Here is a <a href="http://direktor.ru/programs/e_book_4">link to it</a> on the website "September" (there is more information about it on <a href="http://eelmaa.net/workbook/sitebook">my own site</a> , you can also download a <a href="http://eelmaa.net/dld/pervin.doc">review there</a> ).  The book has not been published in the Internet yet (moreover, it is being successfully sold now), so there is no copy-paste here.  The publication is made with the permission of IF "September", except for Habr on the Internet there will be no more publication. <br><br>  (Since this is my first post on Habr√©, please let me know in the comments if this is interesting, because there are quite a few parts)

      Why am I doing this? <br><br>  1. The post <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/edu_2_0/59516/">‚ÄúHelp school sites!‚Äù</a> Received quite a lot of comments.  Grateful to everyone who responded to the call.  But at the same time, most commentators have an idea about the school website (and the problem as a whole), let's say, with a technical bias.  Design, interface, PHPvsHTML, hosting ... That's all there is, of course, but the main problem here is designing, structuring information, filling sections, maintaining the site (what resources).  And this is much more difficult for the school, as the site can be ordered, and then stay with him alone.  Therefore, this publication has the goal of ‚Äúeducating the people‚Äù: what are the real problems of school website building.  Believe me, not at all in technology. <br><br>  2. I myself know that the book is not without flaws.  And when I talked about interface logos, and when I wrote about design and content work.  My ideas were based on the experience of working on several projects (school projects, including) and are obviously poorer than those of readers.  Therefore, constructive comments will be valuable to me.  We'll see if, with the appearance of a large number of valuable comments, I live to be processed in the 2nd edition. <br><br>  3. If everything goes well and this topic is interesting, I can talk about school sites not only about this book.  And I can talk about how site festivals and contests are held (with the presentation of relevant documentation on how to conduct them).  And about the real experience of schools in this direction, and about the problems that arise (which at first glance it is even difficult to imagine).  Now at the design stage of the Association of school sites, I think, and interested readers would be interested in this to participate. <br><br>  In general, let's begin by praying.  Today I am publishing the <b>Introduction</b> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This manual appeared due to the seminars <i>‚ÄúSchool website: from concept to implementation and development‚Äù</i> , which were held at the St. Petersburg Regional Center for Educational Quality and Information Technology Assessment.  Basically, its content identified the issues and problems that arose among the participants who worked on the creation of school sites. <br><br>  Although the site is often viewed as a technological problem, you still need to understand that business is not limited to technology.  School site creation issues are more content questions *. <br><br>  * By content (from the English. <i>Content</i> - content) in web-building they understand the actual content of the site.  These are materials posted on the site: texts, images, music files, etc.).  In a technical sense, the school site is no different from any other. <br><br>  First of all, the manual is addressed to school administrators - school principals, their deputies for SD and BP.  Also, these materials will be needed by deputy directors for IT (in St. Petersburg, this position is called ‚Äúdeputy director for SIS‚Äù - deputy for school information network) *, who are faced with the task of creating and maintaining a school website in real educational conditions.  Based on the specifics of the recipients, the subject of the manual is focused on understanding the school website as a tool for school management and educational activities. <br><br>  * Despite the fact that at the moment this position has been officially abolished in most educational institutions of the city, we understand that the process of informatization, which is quite active in the framework of the national project ‚ÄúEducation‚Äù, equipping schools with computer equipment and connecting to the Network will certainly require the appearance of this person structure of the school, as there is a sufficiently large layer of new functional responsibilities, for which you need a separate specialist. <br><br>  Informatization of education, if it is understood not only as an increase in the number of computers and network bandwidth, but also as a change in the educational paradigm, the emergence and development of new technologies for working with information, includes the emergence of new forms of external self-presentation of OU.  Of course, the site is not the only form of information representation of an educational institution: there are booklets, information guides, etc., but the school‚Äôs website, with proper design, development and substantive support, can be quite a powerful tool, representing ‚Äúoutside‚Äù the data that the school is ready inform about yourself, and able to accumulate diverse and multidimensional information.  But for this, we pay attention, it must be correctly created.  And the problem of creating a well-made school website * is a whole range of problems. <br><br>  * It is obvious that it is impossible to define the concept of ‚Äúgood school website‚Äù, there will be a lot of subjective things here.  It seems that the most adequate definition would be: a <i>site that most fully and accurately reflects the specifics of an educational institution</i> . <br><br>  Therefore, the manual is devoted to information technologies in the primary meaning of this concept - the ability to work with information: to receive it, process it, present it. <br><br>  There is still no answer to the question of how, in principle, the school website differs from any other.  What structure should it have?  Which components are optimal and necessary for the school site, and which ones seem redundant, optional?  How do you work with different contingent of school site visitors - managers, parents, students?  What means, assets, resources can a modern REAL school develop and maintain a school website?  A separate problem is the specificity of the information submission on the school website: as experience shows, most texts on school websites are overloaded with educational terminology, it is not clear to a person who does not have a direct relationship to education, it is not interesting, that is, there is no clear PR strategy in forming the content of the school website.  This is a separate serious problem. <br><br>  Why today there are very few well-made school sites on the Web (‚Äúliterate‚Äù means not a technological component, but a meaningful, full-fledged presentation of a school)?  Why such sites as <a href="http://610.ru/">610.ru</a> or <a href="http://likt590.ru/">likt590.ru</a> are few, and the bulk of them are inexpressive "unreadable" handicrafts, coarsely and tastelessly made and presented on <a href="http://narod.yandex.ru/">Narod.ru</a> ? <br><br>  <b>A few words about the authors.</b>  <b>Who are we?</b> <br><ul><li>  <i>Eelmaa Yuri Vladimirovich.</i>  In the past - a teacher of literature.  Candidate of Pedagogical Sciences.  The developer of a number of educational online projects.  The head of the <a href="http://mlis.fobr.ru/">Metodico-literary Internet server (MLIS) "Literature Lesson"</a> , addressed to language teachers.  Methodologist of the St. Petersburg Regional Center for the Quality Assessment of Education and Information Technologies (subject: ‚ÄúIT in work with education administrators and subject teachers‚Äù). </li><li>  <i>Smirnova Zinaida Yulievna.</i>  A teacher of Russian language and literature with 26 years of experience.  For 16 years - Deputy Director for Experimental Work of the Lyceum of Information and Communication Technologies No. 590 of St. Petersburg.  One of the authors of the concept, structure, texts and organization of the site <a href="http://likt590.ru/">likt590.ru</a> .  Chief Methodologist of the St. Petersburg Regional Center for the Quality Assessment of Education and Information Technologies.  He is the author of the manual ‚ÄúAfter-the-Time Technologies as Alternative Forms of Education‚Äù (in collaboration with A. M. Kamensky) (M., ‚ÄúSeptember‚Äù, 2006). </li></ul><br>  The problem of creating a school website, the authors are engaged in since 2004.  In 2004‚Äì2005  under the auspices of the ROO Krasnoselsky district of St. Petersburg, a large project <i>‚ÄúKrasnoselsky district: an open educational space‚Äù was</i> implemented, designed to accumulate all the information about education for residents of the 350 thousandth urban area.  Since 2006, a seminar for heads of educational institutions has been successfully held at SPbRCCOIT, which gave the name to this book. <br><br>  The peculiarity of the manual is that it was able to combine the technological aspects with the actual management practice of the school.  It is this ‚Äúborderline‚Äù of the content that is important for the authors (we hope, as for the readers).  A book may seem overly simplistic to a technical specialist; for an experienced manager, he is unlikely to say something about the school, which he does not know.  Books on web design and creation of a great variety, a lot of manuals on various aspects of management.  However, the problem of creating a school website is essentially a complex problem.  We tried to consider it simultaneously in two aspects - managerial and technological.  Management issues here are important: after all, the site should be a kind of mirror that reflects the school in all its diversity, in all complexity.  In addition, the work on the site requires the solution of a number of organizational issues.  Technological, informational component is no less important: after all, the site is a whole complex of specific problems, if you use the metaphor, then this is a new language that our education is still mastering.  And in the process of creating a school website, these two groups of problems exist in inseparable unity - as form and content.  It is unlikely that such a book can ever be written by one person.  So far, school administrators and authors of Internet projects were not met in one person. <br><br>  We do not give specific advice from the category of "do so."  More importantly, in our opinion, if the provisions proposed by the reader make him think, assess the potential of his school in such a difficult task as creating a website, he will help to solve problems creatively.  If this happens, we will assume that our task is completed. <br><br>  <b>Upd:</b> Is it just me that I see it or did my habrakat not work? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60550/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60550/</a></p>
