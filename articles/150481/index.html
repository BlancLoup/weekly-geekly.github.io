    <h3>  Introduction </h3><br>  Let me remind you that the initial test consists of 65 questions, the test <b>participants</b> are divided into 4 categories: <b>Donkeys, Sheep, Fox and Sov</b> , according to their ability to conduct the negotiation process.  The first two categories are assessed as negative, the last two as positive.  Here is how the author himself describes these categories: <br><br>  <b>Donkeys</b>  You are blissfully unaware of existing opportunities.  This is usually manifested in a penchant for ill-conceived, predictable and stubborn resistance, when what you get (usually not too much) as a result of negotiations is not enough to recognize them as successful.  Donkeys are also usually guided by the principles deeply rooted in them.  Where ignorance prevails, ‚Äústupid‚Äù behavior arises as if by itself. <br><br>  <b>Sheep</b>  You think that getting something is already good.  You dutifully accept choices made by other people, following them like sheep to slaughter.  You demonstrate some pragmatic flexibility, but you remain a victim of the influence of others.  You have no desire to fight for your interests.  You prefer to give up rather than annoy the other side - or even disappoint her!  The foot has not stamped yet, and you have already crouched in a corner. <br><br>  <b>Foxes</b>  You really understand what is happening and firmly believe that you deserve what you are seeking.  Many Foxes succeed only because of their resourcefulness.  In addition, you love to wise up, being carried away by the game for the sake of the game itself.  Your pragmatism has almost no boundaries, you skillfully play all the weak strings of the Sheep.  And, of course, the people making the "donkey" choice are not a problem for the Foxes.  Heather is so much so that he himself is more cunning. <br><br>  <b>Owls</b> .  Your negotiating style demonstrates that you have the wisdom to assess long-term benefits.  To do this, you build strong relationships with the other side and as a result achieve what you truly deserve.  You are an Owl even if you are fully prepared for the dangers and opportunities that flow from your choice of behavior.  You are respected for what you do and how you do it.  (You, of course, will not exploit Sheep, Foxes and Donkeys.) <br><br><h3>  Primary data processing </h3><br>  So, out of the 17,707 records collected at the time of this analysis, there were quite a few repetitions, since the same person returned to the test several times to correct his own mistakes.  Therefore, for each ip address for analysis, data is taken only once - the first.  There were 6561 records with unique ip. Then the records were removed, in which any questions of the test were omitted, 4106 records remained.  And at the last stage of preprocessing, all records in which answers were not filled out about personal data ‚Äî age, gender, education, and whether a person read the book of Gavin Kennedy or not, were excluded, since it was precisely the dependence of these data on the answers. and we will study.  The final sample for further processing was <b>3,550 records</b> . <br><br><h3>  Final data processing </h3><br>  So, what do we have in these <b>3550 entries</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4a/40b/28e/d4a40b28e893d737ced369f9c9a7108e.gif"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/76b/30d/4ce/76b30d4ceac7165c54cd243e95193685.gif"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/862/b0f/a32/862b0fa3208bc6ded75c7f1a8732021f.gif"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bb6/cf9/f9e/bb6cf9f9ecb0c1f7ca8eadf7e6367c49.gif"><br><br>  As we see, the majority of Habr's readers are men, with higher education, aged from 20 to 30 years.  Actually, this is obvious data, it is only necessary to note that under 10 years of age or over 60 years not a single person has completed the test, and the book of Gavin Kennedy on Habr√© is not very popular. <br><br>  Now let's see how these groups of people are divided by test categories: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/385/71f/d4a/38571fd4aab91900eddf44d4df1c5693.gif"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/96b/964/95c/96b96495c288ca2e076287e538e55ca3.gif"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ac/265/e0d/2ac265e0dfa7dbd0a6136ac5a977da2e.gif"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/358/d70/043/358d700438a07cc30f8c3b8948c721b2.gif"><br><br>  The result is also pretty obvious, but still interesting.  As we see, with age, people learn to negotiate better, as well as higher education adds points to the category of Foxes and Owls, and reduces the skills of Oslo and Sheep, which is good news.  There was no particular difference between men and women, <s>although I really wanted to</s> . <br>  Statistics from reading Gavin Kennedy‚Äôs book shows that the proverb ‚ÄúYou look at a book, but you see a fig‚Äù is not about Habr's readers, and those 89 people who still read this book have significantly improved their negotiating skills, however, it is worth noting that according to tests from the same book. <br><br>  I laid out the complete source data before the initial processing, pre-hashing the ip address.  Perhaps someone will conduct a deeper analysis, if he wants.  Data is available here: <br>  <a href="">http://knyazev-spb.ru/kennedy.dat.gz</a> <br><br>  Thank you for reading this post until the end of successful negotiations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150481/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150481/</a></p>
