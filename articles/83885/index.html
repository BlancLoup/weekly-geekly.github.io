  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Digest of 2009 in the market of web development</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr! <br><br>  We have prepared an <a href="http://2009.tagline.ru/news/digest2009.html">analytical material</a> devoted to the results of 2009 in the market for the development of Internet projects.  The material turned out to be quite large, so I will cite some excerpts (namely, the sections ‚Äúmarket situation‚Äù and ‚Äúdevelopment trends‚Äù), which are of the most interest: <br><br><h1>  Market situation: </h1>  The market size in 2009, according to our estimates, grew in relation to 2008 (we recall, the market volume in 2008 was estimated at the level of 6.8 billion rubles).  The market has about 4,000 players (the overwhelming majority are small companies), which makes it still very opaque.  The financial crisis played a decisive role in the development of the industry in 2009, positively affecting the rate of maturation of the market and the average quality of services provided, as well as the effectiveness of interaction with the client.

      <b>Consolidation</b> <br><br>  Almost from the very beginning of 2009, individual representatives of large and medium-sized companies began to negotiate the formation of various associations that would help protect their interests and grow the market as a whole.  Some of these initiatives did not end in anything, and a number of initiatives were brought to a logical conclusion and received the status of key events in the industry. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>The customer started counting money</b> <br><br>  One of the most important factors that influenced the market situation in 2009 was the customer‚Äôs desire to use the invested money on the Internet with maximum efficiency. <br>  On the one hand, the Internet as a communication channel has grown against the background of other rapidly falling advertising segments. <br><br>  On the other hand, in the context of austerity budgets, the customer stopped responding to ‚Äúbeautiful pictures‚Äù and began to demand the achievement of final business objectives, which could not but have a positive effect on the quality of services provided in terms of marketing and sales. <br><br>  This fact has helped to ‚Äúthin out‚Äù the numerous ranks of non-professional players, contributing to an increase in the market share of companies aimed at achieving the goals of their clients. <br><br>  <b>Reshaping</b> <br><br>  In a crisis, business processes and the positioning of many companies turned out to be ineffective, forcing the most mobile market players to reconsider their marketing strategy and the set of products offered to the customer. <br><br>  The segment of ‚Äúcorporate sites‚Äù significantly ‚Äúsank‚Äù (since for the most part they do not set themselves accountable business tasks), the automation systems development segments (helping the customer to reduce costs) and the ‚Äúquick‚Äù promotions segment (allowing for rapid growth sales).  A large number of major players have begun to pay close attention to integrated and long-term project support and development services. <br><br>  Those players who could not quickly react to the changed environment turned out to be inevitably in a losing position. <br><br>  <b>Transparency, entry threshold</b> <br><br>  Despite the crisis, the threshold for entering the market remained very low.  Any team of 2-3 freelancers with several projects in the portfolio can still declare themselves a ‚Äúweb studio‚Äù.  Nevertheless, it became much more difficult for such companies to survive, because the customer has become more focused on achieving the end result and long-term relationships. <br><br>  The emergence of new and strengthening positions of existing supra-industry organizations capable of systematization and market analysis, contributes to an increase in market transparency and gives the customer more and more tools for market orientation. <br><br>  <b>The emergence of educational programs</b> <br><br>  The emergence and development of an increasing number of educational programs aimed at raising qualified specialists within the industry cannot but rejoice.  The fact that people from the market become teachers of such courses makes it possible to provide training in conditions as close as possible to "combat". <br><br><h1>  Trends of market development in 2009 </h1>  The following key trends in the development of the market in 2010 can be identified: <br><br>  <b>Mergers and acquisitions, consolidation</b> <br><br>  In the near future, the market is expected both by large acquisitions of successful companies and by mass merging into compact formations of small companies from adjacent segments.  The trend to consolidate the market in terms of strengthening the role of supra-industry associations will be decisive in terms of market development. <br><br>  <b>Growth in demand for complex services</b> <br><br>  Companies that are able to effectively close all digital directions of their customers will have an advantage over competitors (including network agencies). <br><br>  This statement is true for the segment of large players; on the middle segment, narrow specialization will remain an effective business model. <br><br>  <b>Strengthening the role of customer service</b> <br><br>  Customer service as a tool to retain the customer and increase the average bill per customer will be one of the priorities for the development of large digital agencies.  At the moment, customer service in the vast majority of companies are absent or inefficient.  For the construction and development of these areas will be actively used the experience of adjacent and more adult markets, including with the involvement of qualified personnel from such companies. <br><br>  <b>Transferring work to in-house</b> <br><br>  A customer whose online business component is critical to the company and has a significant weight in the overall turnover (and only such a customer!) Will inevitably develop key competences in digital within its structure.  Forming a team independently covering key areas of responsibility and a network of subcontractors in less important areas will become the most common work model in the coming years. <br><br>  <b>Development of independent consulting services</b> <br><br>  We expect active development of independent consulting services in the market.  The range of services in this segment can begin from an audit of the effectiveness of work with the company's current contractors and end with the development of a comprehensive brand presence strategy on the Internet. <br><br>  <b>Growth in the share of state projects</b> <br><br>  An important trend will be the inevitable increase in the share of ‚Äúfair‚Äù state projects implemented at prices close to the market in the portfolios of large and medium-sized market players. <br><br>  <b>Technological innovations</b> <br><br>  In the face of increasing competition, dynamic companies will actively borrow successful Western innovative technologies, applying them to the Russian market.  Already, such diverse areas as SaaS, communication projects in micro-blogs, augmented reality technologies, eye-tracking usability assessment systems, etc. are actively developing. <br><br>  <b>Development studios own startups</b> <br><br>  More and more companies in parallel with the development of the agency business will develop their own projects, thus closing the holes in the production plan, on the one hand, and hoping to get a higher rate of profit, on the other. <br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1>  The crisis of 2009 was a powerful impetus that caused many companies to wake up from hibernation.  Promising companies had excellent growth opportunities, while ‚Äúballast‚Äù began to gradually disappear from the market.  The growing processes of the Internet projects development industry, barely tangible in the period 2005-2008, began to gain a tangible turn, which allows us to hope to create a transparent environment in which both the customer and the contractor will be easily guided within the next two to three years. <br><br>  <i>You can read about the business of market leaders, key events of 2009, personnel transitions for the year and expert comments in the full version of the material - <a href="http://2009.tagline.ru/news/digest2009.html">http://2009.tagline.ru/news/digest2009.html</a> .</i>  <i>The material was prepared by the Tagline expert group.</i> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83885/</a></p>
