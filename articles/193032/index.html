And, judging by the number of pluses to publications in this hub, reviews of old technology are really interesting and in demand.  And for that matter, I decided to get the miracle of Japanese engineers from Fujitsu, a text editor OASYS 30AFII, from a dark corner, and share with you his review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5bf/97e/fe8/5bf97efe84367cdbdede91b03b39be6c.jpg" alt="image">

      <b><font color="red">Attention!</font></b>  Many pictures and photos. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What is a text editor Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII?</b> <br><br>  OASYS 30AFII is a specialized laptop computer based on a 16-bit Intel 80186 processor, which has a 12 "monochrome (blue-white) LCD display, two 3.5" drives, an integrated thermal printer and a keyboard with Japanese characters.  All this is structurally combined in one case and weighs about 8 kg, and its dimensions are 360x155x348 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fb/5fa/c57/3fb5fac57bdad05c5d5d201e26e61341.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to the integrated peripherals, there are connectors for connecting a printer and a modem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fa/b7b/23f/9fab7b23fb8f512ff8e1e2d9630ae56e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  OASYS software allowed not only editing and creating text files, but also working with tables, charts and figures.  Print the necessary document or write the address on the envelope "without departing from the cash register" could be using a printer built into the upper part of the body, and it was precisely this that the text editor Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII differed favorably from other wearable computers of the time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/005/fcb/8b6/005fcb8b66b20644c056adba5575a526.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Using a modem, the text editor Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII could exchange files with ordinary personal computers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b03/e25/ad1/b03e25ad16b064ad0f5c240afb2952d8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, it is possible to use both external and internal modem.  However, the internal modem (as well as the external one) must be purchased separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40e/518/52f/40e51852ff58ae9c54e0f10bc18c3a39.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII text editor can interact not only with personal computers, but also with some office equipment, but in most cases a special matching device is required to connect it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec5/dbe/332/ec5dbe332f3757a357dd67988919237c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The release of Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII text editor was announced in June 1987 and was sold at a price of 248,000 yen. <br><br>  <b>Specifications.</b> <br><br>  Processor - Intel 80186, frequency unknown <br>  RAM - 256Kb <br>  Hard drive - no <br>  Disk Drive - 2x 3.5 "FDD <br>  Monitor - 12 "LCD (monochrome), 840 characters (21 lines, 40 characters per line) <br>  Printing device - 24-needle thermal printer. <br>  Power supply - built-in, 110 V, 50 / 60Hz, 45 W <br><br>  <b>Software + quest.</b> <br><br>  Unfortunately, information about the operating system used and the OASYS software is practically absent on the Internet.  The site <a href="http://www.ykanda.jp/">http://www.ykanda.jp/</a> turned out to be the most useful, however, those who do not know Japanese have nothing to do there.  Even the magazines of the time that advertised the Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII did not shine with technical details. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e2/cc6/568/8e2cc656875b4a1390b94259eb947202.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Honestly, I do not speak Japanese, so I had to be content with the ‚Äúpearls‚Äù that the Google Translator gave me. <br><br>  The Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII text editor is supposedly (! ??) running under slightly modified MS-DOS 3.1 OS, with the operating system and OASYS software located on just one double-density diskette (720 Kb).  The second drive, as you probably guessed, allowed you to work with documents stored on a separate diskette without removing the boot diskette. <br><br>  The file system of these floppy disks is not compatible with FAT12 and FAT16 - personal computer running DOS / Windows does not read such floppy disks. <br><br>  It‚Äôs quite natural that I tried to give the Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII editor a bootable diskette containing the usual MS-DOS 3.2 and a couple of diagnostic tools, but to my chagrin, he didn‚Äôt want to start from it, which I honestly warned me in Japanese. <br><br>  However, I managed to copy data from my native floppy disks to an image file using Teledisk 2.23.  It is completely possible that someone also has this text editor, but diskettes to it are lost or corrupted, so it makes sense to honestly share the captured images ( <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/VbawR0sW9UJ8L">you can take them here</a> ). <br><br>  Just do not forget that before writing the image to a 1.44 MB diskette (2HD), it must be turned into a DD diskette (720Kb), carefully sealing the density selection window with blue tape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a46/09f/afe/a4609fafe4b20f7b18f3c3c58b4d66e5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And now - a quest for the brave, dexterous, skillful! <br><br>  Due to the fact that I did not manage to either read or write information on diskettes in the format understood by the text editor OASYS 30AFII, I wholeheartedly hope that in Habr's readers will wake up the spirit of medieval naturalists, backed by wisdom and life experience that will help me bring it to the end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31c/4ee/5fc/31c4ee5fc291426b1b563a70594aecbe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you can find a way to read / write files from your native Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII text diskettes, or you can create a bootable diskette with MS-DOS and a couple of diagnostic utilities (and you can boot from it), I‚Äôll give you two heroes And I wish the spruce cone!  Anyway, no one reads the text, but only the pictures look.  Since the <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/VbawR0sW9UJ8L">floppy image files</a> are compressed by Teledisk, I strongly recommend that you first write them to floppy disks and only then begin your experiments. <br><br>  <b>Appearance.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b5d/800/6fc/b5d8006fc9f5a08343b09defe4ed2428.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Ready to carry (with a retracted keyboard, a lid closed by a printer, and a raised handle), the Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII looks like a suitcase with a pair of bricks in it.  I remind you that its weight is 8 kilograms, and not every office worker can call him light. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f48/692/991/f48692991ad52de639852c8add27a374.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In the retracted state, the keyboard is fixed on the front of the case with two latches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/27a/b47/066/27ab47066df96241de3b3a6f44e40f76.jpg" alt="image"><br>  We take out the keyboard, and a monochrome LCD screen appears to our eyes.  Its angle of inclination can be adjusted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8b/d18/6ab/d8bd186ab4ab3e2f73291dfb7f4d1210.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The keyboard buttons are signed with hieroglyphs, however, they did not forget about the English layout either. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbd/3d6/36f/bbd3d636f4a2c406dfb9d2ef4d4dd5a0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  To the right of the monitor are the brightness and contrast controls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edd/609/7bb/edd6097bbefcc6a3f21451eee1185b15.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the right side of the case there are two 3.5 "drives and a power button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b5f/982/635/b5f9826351626f4a33f051186651f302.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the back of the Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII text editor, there are two interface connectors and a compartment with a lid that covers the power cord. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c06/d60/702/c06d607028aab1d0ce3902d084deb550.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the top of the case is a thermal printer, which is also closed with a lid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/303/2c4/2e8/3032c42e87d88cd5d3f5e874d90120a6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The cartridge for the printer is filled not with an ordinary ribbon with paint, but with a special thermal film, the coloring matter from which is transferred to ordinary paper under the influence of high temperature. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the cartridge has spoiled a long time ago - instead of the expected text, a virgin sheet comes out of the printer. <br><br>  <b>Internal organization.</b> <br><br>  My first acquaintance with the inner world of the Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII occurred twenty minutes after it fell into my hands.  In order to make sure that the Japanese text editor is working, I decided to include it in the electrical network, and in ours, domestic.  I was not embarrassed by the bourgeois plug at the end of the power cord - the previous owner of this device carefully attached an adapter to it, so I stuck it into a wall outlet with a clear conscience.  Turn on, it works! <br><br>  But he worked for Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII not for long, and after two minutes it spontaneously shut down.  And I did not want to turn on any more. <br><br>  Only after this incident, I remembered that in Japan the supply voltage of household appliances is only 100 volts, and, armed with a screwdriver, it is useful to change the fuse.  After replacing it, the text editor started working again, and so that this would not happen again, I had to get a step-down transformer. <br><br>  In order to get to the interior of the text editor Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII, you need to unscrew the 2 screws on the back of the case. <br><br>  Remove the back wall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a7/907/1af/5a79071af5939439de59384eb0f504be.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The boards of the device are closed from electromagnetic interference by a screen of metallized film. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/444/bce/ebc/444bceebc18f29c4817c5c9b08c68af4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A80186 processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/469/dbf/43b/469dbf43b3d4e43d428fe4bbff11cbfe.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Memory - 8 chips on 32Kb.  Total 256 KB of RAM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de4/157/2d7/de41572d73ba36d3c2e5494cb6aba2df.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Fujitsu's proprietary chips against the background of Motorola's IC standard logic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6b/d75/79f/c6bd7579fe3f74005985acb2e3ec5f87.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Under the first board there is another one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f0/8b0/fb9/5f08b0fb91c3c259bfbd588e17efe34f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  At the bottom, next to the fan, is the power supply.  On the left - the drive unit. <br><br>  Now you can collect everything as it was, and include a text editor. <br><br>  <b>Demonstration of work.</b> <br><br>  Actually, I will not show you how to work with the Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII text editor.  Not because I am harmful, but because I could not figure out how it works without knowledge of Japanese.  Using the universal typing method, we were able to determine which button to press on so that the printer could start printing.  Also, quite by chance, we managed to remove one file from a floppy disk, after which all empirical experiments were stopped out of harmly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e89/802/153/e898021531b24d07df855f7272dce11d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Download a text editor from a floppy disk.  Initial screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef7/b6b/9cd/ef7b6b9cdd90902848345aa9105dacf7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  List of files on diskette. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/465/e6d/8c9/465e6d8c95d6edd93d60aafb6820018a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Open any file.  Oppa!  Cyrillic? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed5/8ce/d06/ed58ced0684dadf07e8cbbd5650ce35f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Go to another menu item.  Anyway, nothing is clear. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  That's probably all that I wanted to tell Habr's readers about the Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII text editor.  In my review, I did not touch on the practical part of working with OASYS software (for example, working with text or tables), since it is practically impossible without the knowledge of Japanese.  There is a possibility that one of the dear readers dealt with this text editor, and will be able to share additional information about it.  And to someone who can make a bootable diskette with MS-DOS for Fujitsu OASYS 30AFII, or find a way to read and write information from his diskettes, I will be very grateful for the help. <br><br>  Have a nice day and thank you for your attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193032/</a></p>
