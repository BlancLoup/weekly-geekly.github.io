Herzfeld on the Hot Seat</a> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Interview in English about working life godfather ARPANET</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <i>What was your introduction to computing?</i> <br>  He was a graduate student at the University of Chicago, in 1948;  He was instructed in the ENIAC built up  It was hugely important stuff. <br><br>  Then, ARC, JCR Licklider gave me one or three lectures.  He said that we‚Äôre really pretty stupid.  I think theres a better way.  He was a brilliant man, and I became a disciple of his. <br><br>  <i>In the ARPA together with the Licklider Office</i> <br>  Yes.  IPTO was one of the things at ARPA that I became godfather of.  If it‚Äôs got into trouble. <br><br>  [The IPTO] I‚Äôm claiming to be the godfather, not the father.  And as godfather, <br><br>  <i>What else did you do as godfather?</i> <br>  I signed the first two or three orders in 1966 and 1967 as director.  I said, however, it is small and crappy it is.  But I had recruited Bob Taylor as the follow-on. <br><br>  One day, he got $ 1 million in 20 minutes.  [When he recipes this story]  I was sure that networking computers would change computing.  I thought it was a licklider. <br><br>  <i>In those days, did you casually hand out big sums like that very often?</i> <br>  Whenever it was needed.  It was a long list of things.  I was ruthless about that. <br><br>  <i>What else did ipto do in those early times?</i> <br>  We created the whole artificial intelligence community.  And we created the computer science world.  When we started [IPTO], there were no computer science or computer science.  None. <br><br>  <i>DARPA has pulled back from long-range, high-risk projects?</i> <br>  There certainly has been a change.  But it may be inevitable. <br><br>  Im not sure now could be the old ARPA nowadays.  It would be illegal, perhaps.  We now understand everything about substance. <br><br>  It was very broadly technically IPO.  We structured it.  It is very hard to do that today. <br><br>  <i>But why?</i>  <i>Do big things</i> <br>  Because you‚Äôre too busy, you don‚Äôt really want to know. <br><br>  You, Department X, will do Y, theyd say, Yes, sir.  Now they say, Well get back to you.  I blame Congress for a good part of it.  And agency heads are all wishy-washy.  Whats missing is leadership? <br><br>  <i>FBI had been given emergency response responders, including weapons of mass destruction.</i>  <i>But, the Post said, many of the kits didn‚Äôt work.</i>  <i>What kind of report?</i> <br>  We are becoming incapable of handling a major challenge.  We are losing the ability to do big, complicated things.  In your example, it‚Äôs not a problem.  They only thought about buying the radios. <br><br>  <i>Is it partly a failure of technology?</i> <br>  Absolutely not.  We haven‚Äôt been buying every day.  Whats missing is leadership?  The whole thing is just off the rails. <br><br>  <i>Whats going on at the National Science Foundation?</i> <br>  My friends complain that they have to submit one funded.  Cuckoo  And its tremendously demoralizing and very inefficient.  The process is too risk-averse.  But doing really good research is a high-risk proposition.  If the system doesn‚Äôt have to think about small problems. <br><br>  <i>Could there be another unhappy surprise like Sputnik?</i> <br>  Yes, I expect it.  Someone is doing a lot of people.  There is terrorism.  New York Harbor. <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228137/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228137/</a></p>
