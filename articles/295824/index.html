  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most successful top managers in the future may be gamers.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is estimated that on average, students spend approximately 10 thousand hours at computer games while studying at an institution of higher education ‚Äî almost as many as at a desk.  The gap in the perception of reality between teachers and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_Y">generation Y is</a> growing.  Schools have to adjust their curriculum and teaching methods in order to reduce it. <br><br>  Studies of the University of Colorado showed that due to gamification, it is possible to increase both the fundamental and practical knowledge of students by 10-15%.  For example, Domodedovo Airport looks after future personnel while young people play simulators, said Alexander Vlasov, an official representative of the airport. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúThere will be three types of companies available.  These are directly the airline, the airport and the handler, the one who provides ground handling services for the aircraft.  The player acts as a big manager, for example, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">SimCity</a> , builds a full-fledged city.  There will be about the same, only at the airport level.  If it is an airline, it can buy three different types of aircraft, ‚Äùnoted Vlasov.

      And air flights themselves without simulators are impossible, assured pilot-instructor Andrei Krasnoperov. <br>  ‚ÄúThe pilot gets 90 percent of the skills on the simulator.  On the distribution of attention, flying under the curtain, that is, the same flights.  Practically, it must be taught to take off and landing in real conditions.  This saves time and money, ‚Äùexplained Krasnoperov. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf we are talking specifically not about scientific, but about engineering qualities, often the skills are much more important than knowledge.  That is, the ability to react quickly, at the level of the spinal cord, and on the subcortex, understand what actions must be correct, any lengthy calculations, solving equations, and so on.  The decision must be made quickly and correctly, ‚ÄùPisarev is sure. <br><br>  Based on these considerations, it is quite the avid gamers who may be among the successful top managers in the future.  At the games it is possible to bring up even future financial magnates.  Under the terms of the problem, each team of students must prepare their virtual company to enter the IPO. <br><br>  The hotel chain Marriot has created a hotel management game.  50 thousand employees studied on this program.  And the World Bank, through the game, forces its managers to solve the problems of poverty and hunger in backward countries. <br><br>  According to Gartner consulting company, in two years, the cumulative gamification market in the corporate sector will be $ 5.5 billion. <br><br>  Already, 40% of the largest organizations in the world are training personnel through game simulators, Kommersant <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2842260">cites</a> data. <br><br>  For a long time, video games were not taken seriously, especially when it came to their use for education.  At best, they were considered a waste of time, at worst - they saw in them another reason for the ‚Äúmoral decay‚Äù of young generations.  According to experts, computer games have a unique opportunity for other types of media to communicate knowledge about the real world through interactive immersion into the virtual world. <br><br>  Despite the obvious potential, training through video games in modern schools is extremely rare.  This is due not only to the prejudice of society, but also to the huge funds required to create beautiful and complex game worlds.  To overcome this barrier will require political will, <a href="http://m.forbes.ru/article.php%3Fid%3D82871">writes</a> Forbes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295824/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295824/</a></p>
