What is the whole vector of human development? <br><br>  Significant financial flows are invested in the development of the quality of human life.  The main sources of deterioration in the quality of life in general are all sorts of diseases and mortality.  Work on solving these problems is going on in seven main areas: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Cryonics. </li><li>  Gene modification. </li><li>  Cyborgization. </li><li>  Digitization. </li><li>  Nanomedicine. </li><li>  Artificial Intelligence. </li><li>  Regeneration.  Biotechnology. </li></ul><br>  There are about 15 directions in total, and they all describe how it is approximately tentatively to achieve a radical increase in human life expectancy and better health by 2040.

        </script>
      <br>
      The struggle goes simultaneously in several directions. <br><br>  <b>What kind of prerequisites can we observe right now?</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Social experiment in China with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D2DBf1wrjG58">rating of citizens and total surveillance</a> . </li><li>  A significant reduction in the cost of technology when approaching the point of technological singularity.  The point at which further development of technology will occur abruptly and unpredictable. </li><li>  The development of Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, cloud computing and <a href="https://www.cloud4y.ru/cloud-hosting/">infrastructure technologies</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/cloud4y/blog/441802/">Legislative changes</a> from creating a framework for <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/cloud4y/blog/445252/">regulating information processing issues</a> to the introduction of electronic signatures, document flow and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/cloud4y/blog/445720/">digital profiles of citizens</a> . </li><li>  Significant steps in the evolution of Artificial Intelligence and neural networks. </li><li>  Most of all, we are interested in such areas as cyborgization, artificial intelligence, nanomedicine, regeneration and artificial organs, bioinformatics, and concepts of digital immortality. </li></ul><br>  <b>There are a number of factors giving rise to the wildest assumptions.</b> <br><br>  First of all, if we consider the current goals of human civilization, we will also understand the tactical steps that it is taking to achieve them. <br><br>  Already now we see the first steps of cyborgization - artificial limbs for the disabled, entirely controlled by signals from the brain.  Relatively inexpensive and high-quality artificial hearts.  Soon we can assume the appearance of biomechanical analogues of all internal organs. <br><br>  Under the conditions of creating a full-fledged life support system, this means interesting perspectives and opportunities. <br><br>  In the end, humanity is on the verge of creating an artificial autonomous body. <br>  Some difficulties with the central nervous system. <br><br>  By the way, it is planned to use it to connect a person to the global network (cloud) by means of nano-medicine.  In particular, we are talking about creating an <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/cloud4y/blog/448728/">interface between the human brain and the cloud</a> - B / CI (Human Brain / Cloud Interface). <br><br>  In this case, the question is in the Theseus ship‚Äôs mental experiment, which can be formulated as follows: ‚ÄúIf all components of the original object were replaced, does the object remain the same object?‚Äù In other words, if humanity learns to replace human brain cells with equivalent artificial constructs, will man remain human or will it be an artificial lifeless creature? <br><br>  Synthetic neuron predict by the 2030th year.  It would allow to connect the brain with the cloud, even without the use of special neuron-robots, since it would greatly simplify the ability to create an interface. <br><br>  <b>What is already implemented?</b> <br><br>  Already, Artificial Intelligence is planned to be used for diagnostics in medicine in tens and hundreds of thousands of parameters.  This simplifies diagnosis and takes medicine to a new level. <br><br>  Constant monitoring of health, which we are already observing at a primitive level in the form of bracelets that track the biological parameters of the current state of the body, is already yielding positive results.  According to the latest data, people who regularly monitor their condition in this way live longer. <br><br>  An artificial mind capable of understanding and interpreting natural languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill be able to interact with a person sufficiently tightly for joint and rapid progress. <br>  The computer will be able to generate new ideas, as he has now learned, albeit at a primitive level, to create, say, musical works. <br><br>  <b>So, what is next?</b> <br><br>  Thus, AI will begin to improve itself, and this will inevitably lead to an exponential growth of technology. <br><br>  Creating a complete model of the human brain will raise the question of transferring consciousness to a new carrier. <br><br>  Certain prerequisites for the separation of the central nervous system come primarily from the medical industry.  Reported successful experiments on a dog's head transplant.  As for the transplantation of a human head, so far the experiments are limited to a complete combination of tissues, blood vessels, nerve fibers, and even the spine on a dead body in 2017.  The transfer queue for living people with disabilities is already enough to expect experiments in the near future.  In particular, one of the first applicants is a citizen of China, and the next is a man from Russia. <br><br>  This will lead science to the possibility of head transplantation (original or modified) to a new biomechanical body. <br><br>  Genetic engineering is not far behind.  The ultimate goal is to create a medicine for old age and eliminate the errors of standard gene codes.  Achieving this is preceded by screening combinations of various methods for extending natural (non-cyborgized) life in mice, the creation of ageless transgenic animals.  The basis for this should be a new unified theory of aging and its mathematical modeling. <br><br>  At our current level, these tasks are assigned to providing extensive databases that capture the links between genomics, proteomics of aging and other sciences. <br><br>  Initially, one of the closest and attainable goals is the creation of a new type of drugs based on artificial selection for the creation of symbionts leading to longer life expectancy.  A prerequisite for their creation is the active study of the genome and those of its sites that are responsible for longevity. <br><br>  Scientists do not bypass the issue of losses during DNA replication.  It is known that during copying during life, some end regions of the molecule are shortened, and by old age, copying occurs with losses, which leads to deterioration of the organism. <br><br>  At this stage, we are still learning how to diagnose and evaluate factors that affect aging as such.  The first priority is to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs based on the markers of aging and life expectancy. <br><br>  <b>Live to immortality?</b> <br><br>  For those who want to somehow live up to the jump in science, which will increase the life expectancy, not only the science of a healthy lifestyle, but also cryonics, which ultimately should allow freezing of the body, is being actively developed. <br>  We are now on that part of the road, when the most important is the ability to properly manage the amount of information that our civilization has accumulated.  For these purposes, we are already able to ensure its safety and accessibility, ordering and infrastructure for interaction, be it protected circuits, state-certified or high-availability optical rings. <br><br>  Obviously, the events described are planned and fully predictable. <br><br>  Certain fears are caused by the scenarios that the modern cinematograph introduces into the consciousness of the audience, showing the uprising of machines, the enslavement of people with new technologies.  We, in turn, share optimistic forecasts, are engaged in our health and try to provide the highest possible level of quality for future projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450144/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450144/</a></p>
