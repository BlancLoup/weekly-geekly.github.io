On our blog pages there have been reviews of many Lenovo products: smartphones, tablets, smart watches, computers and laptops.  The list turned out to be big, but there is still something missing in it, namely, monitors. <br><br>  Lenovo Y27g Razer Edition - an excellent candidate to fill this gap.  This is a 27-inch gaming monitor with a curved matte, * VA-matrix, a response time of 4 ms, and a refresh rate of 144 Hz.  Also, like any serious gaming monitor, the Lenovo Y27g Razer Edition has support for NVIDIA G-Sync technology (synchronization technology of the display screen refresh rate and FPS video card) and other, especially gaming features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad2/197/de9/ad2197de9f30eef843f0d9bb4575bd5b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Lenovo Y27g monitor can be found in two versions: normal and Razer Edition, the latter created in collaboration with Razer.  These products are distinguished by the presence of a backlight on the back of the Razer Edition model and, of course, by the price.  But first things first.

      Lenovo Y27g Razer Edition looks like the most common modern gaming display.  And only the curved display of a large diagonal gives it a belonging to the top product.  Frames were medium in size, and the manufacturer's logo lurked in the lower left corner of the front panel.  In short, Lenovo Y27g Razer Edition is designed so that the user is not distracted from the gameplay on a shiny logo, a bright Power LED, and other design elements.  The radius of curvature of the screen is 1800 mm.  The display bend will be clearly visible both from the side and in the work behind the monitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/47d/e31/5fe/47de315feff9afdf9b55fab667f5750e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab6/84b/211/ab684b21153512d026c5285ca08eff74.jpg"><br><br>  The headphone hook, located on the left panel, refused a pleasant designer find.  Now you do not need to look for a separate place for the "ears" on the table, or hang the headphones on the monitor on top.  Well, if the hook for some reason is not needed, then you can always remove it inside the left frame.  The standard 3.5mm audio jack for the headset is located right here on the left side, under the USB ports.  Headphones or a headset can be connected without problems - no need to reach for the connector on the rear panel, as is the case with other gaming monitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3d/bdb/b2a/f3dbdbb2a80fab22122a361b48f98aa0.jpg"><br><br>  All control buttons Lenovo Y27g are on the front panel in the lower right corner.  The keys are mechanical, and the Power button is separated from the main row by means of an LED.  The only thing that was not pleasant in this block is the icons of control keys, the color of which perfectly merges with the frame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dc5/9ac/2a6/dc59ac2a6123d652fc247c01b220ef01.jpg"><br><br>  However, we will talk later about how comfortable it is to play and work behind a monitor with a curved screen, but for now we‚Äôll continue to inspect Lenovo y27g.  On the left side of the monitor is a 3.5 mm audio jack and two USB 3.0 connectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5f/317/09d/e5f31709d37a938ad361f030d32b42d0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/beb/81b/310/beb81b31013f7b6ebbaadb80700d8110.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ed/8aa/d70/8ed8aad70fad37ee9a6a4047be699eca.jpg"><br><br>  On the back of the monitor are holes for cooling, VESA mount 100x100 mm, covered with a plastic monitor leg and all its connectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c9/c12/ed3/1c9c12ed391c7ad0532d494bc82fcc2b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a6b/d1b/7b4/a6bd1b7b45aff4b45a5fc0edb7359e3f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2a/e87/993/a2ae879935d73eadfa5b587c4077e45a.jpg"><br><br>  To connect the video card, there are only two ports: HDMI v1.4 and DisplayPort v1.2.  DVI connector for Lenovo Y27g is not provided - this is the limitation of the module NVIDIA G-Sync.  Also, the display does not have a separate audio input, but it is not required.  PC sound will be output via HDMI or DisplayPort.  Also at the back is another USB 3.0 connector for connecting peripherals and a separate USB 3.0 type B for connecting the display with a PC.  All connectors are parallel to the matrix. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32d/dfb/2d5/32ddfb2d50b73011d21eda848825a42e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/343/104/8f9/3431048f9b845aa235d7d73863db32f8.jpg"><br><br>  Lenovo Y27g also stands out for its power supply.  Of course, external power supplies, which allow to reduce the thickness of the display, are no longer a rarity.  However, in the case of the Lenovo Y27g, the PSU turned out to be not so much interesting as its execution.  Since the power consumption of modern monitors is almost the same as that of laptops, the engineers decided to use the same power supply for these devices.  Included with the product is a Lenovo ADP-65FD B power supply unit with a capacity of 65 W (20 V, 3.25 A) with a standard Lenovo rectangular connector.  With this power supply, you can also charge compatible laptops of this brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af3/881/212/af3881212cb1190efc1f746219ae05a8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b7/3f6/728/2b73f672824ffc11baa1b2808a067a62.jpg"><br><br>  The leg of the Lenovo Y27g is large, its shape resembles the Latin letter V. In spite of the unusual shape, the monitor will stand firmly on the table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/468/300/7c4/4683007c493c24513298493a6c0057b3.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks to its leg, the monitor can be rotated 30 degrees both clockwise and counterclockwise.  The screen can be raised to a height of 110 mm, and tilted in the range of -5 degrees (on itself) to 30 degrees (from itself). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28d/1f4/c5b/28d1f4c5b4fbc3bbd655e27ad5bbba43.jpg"><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><blockquote>  <b>Diagonal:</b> 27 inches <br>  <b>Resolution:</b> 1920x1080, 16: 9, Full HD <br>  <b>Screen Type:</b> LCD, Matte, VA <br>  <b>Curvature radius:</b> 1800 mm <br>  <b>Backlight type:</b> LED (WLED) <br>  <b>Max.</b>  <b>brightness:</b> 300 cd / m ^ 2 <br>  <b>Static contrast ratio:</b> 3,000: 1 <br>  <b>Max.

But other display characteristics are known: brightness of 300 cd / m ^ 2, and static contrast at 3000: 1.  By the way, such a high static contrast is found only in * VA-matrices, a kind of business card. <br><br>  The maximum refresh rate of the screen was 144 Hz - an excellent indicator, which is very rare in displays with IPS or * VA matrixes.  Typically, displays with TN screens and corresponding picture quality dominate this market segment. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Lenovo Artery Utility</font> </h2><br>  The times have already passed long ago when the game monitor was supposed to show a beautiful picture or have only a fast matrix.  Now such a display should have additional features, and Lenovo y27g, of course, has them. <br><br>  With the help of the Lenovo Artery utility, you can change the brightness and contrast without accessing the menu, select the monitor operation profiles (movies, Internet or games).  Also with the help of Lenovo Artery, you can quickly change the resolution, turn on or turn off the blue filter, turn on automatic brightness control, and also display the frame counter or crosshair.  The latter will especially appreciate lovers of shooters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/512/8ec/9e1/5128ec9e1c0e6b8a17ffebe00b4ab603.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/878/066/4fb/8780664fb8737b65da2d001e64c443f0.png"><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Testing: visual assessment of image quality</font> </h2><br>  Immediately answer the main question of many of our readers: how good is the curved screen and does it make sense?  Yes, the curved screen is a really cool thing.  Watching videos or playing games is a pleasure, Lenovo Y27g really allows you to immerse yourself in the gameplay or the atmosphere of the film.  You can get used to the curved screen in just a couple of days, after which its geometry will no longer distract and draw attention to itself. <br><br>  The only thing that you definitely should not do for Lenovo y27g, as well as behind any monitor with a curved screen, is to draw or straighten the geometry of the photos.  Unfortunately, due to the peculiarities of absolutely all monitors with curved screens, any straight line that crosses the screen from left to right will look like a curved one, similar to the display itself.  Of course, with time you can get used to this, but for professional work it is still better to choose monitors with direct matrices. <br><br>  As for the color reproduction, here the monitor showed itself well.  If we talk about the visual assessment of color, then when setting the default settings, all the colors on the screen acquired a blue tint.  This is a common problem of most displays, which is solved by calibration or in the monitor menu - if there is a ‚Äúblue filter‚Äù item.  Fortunately, the Lenovo Y27g has such an item and you can remove blue shades in just a minute. <br><br>  Another important detail in any monitor is the flicker of the backlight.  On the Lenovo website, the presence of flicker in the LED backlight is not indicated, however, for a couple of weeks spent with the Lenovo Y27g, the flicker of the backlight was not noticed.  Either the WLED-backlight of this display is devoid of flicker, or its frequency is a hundred kilohertz, which is completely unnoticed by the naked eye. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Testing: G-Sync</font> </h2><br>  You can not ignore the support of G-Sync.  If you do not go into a deep technical description, then we can say that this technology synchronizes the refresh rate of the monitor screen with the FPS frequency that the video card issues.  As a result, the games on the Lenovo Y27g Razer Edition will look very smooth, and the screen gaps and friezes will disappear from the screen - the two types of artifacts that every gamer has encountered.  In addition, it does not need a flagship video adapter.  To activate G-Sync, any fresh NVIDIA video card is suitable, from GeForce GTX 650Ti BOOST and higher.  But will it be possible to play comfortably on such a card, that is another question :) <br><br>  When you turn on G-Sync games began to look completely different.  A very smooth picture without jerks, friezes and other artifacts, combined with a curved screen, made it possible to fully immerse into the game world.  Also, another advantage of G-Sync is that to activate this technology, it is not necessary to maintain FPS at 60 frames per second.  To enable this technology, it is necessary to provide an FPS frequency of 30 to 60 frames per second.  With Full HD resolution, this is the simplest task, even for entry-level gaming graphics cards and high (but not always maximum) graphics settings. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Testing: benchmarks</font> </h2><br>  We now turn to testing with benchmarks.  For testing, a standard monitor profile was chosen so that the ‚Äúgame‚Äù optimizations had a minimal impact on the quality of testing.  The settings were reset to factory settings, the display was heated for an hour.  The X-Rite i1Display Pro colorimeter was used for testing along with Argyll CMS software packages (in conjunction with the GUI DispcalGUI) and the HCFR Colorimeter. <br><br>  The maximum brightness of white color was 281.1 cd ^ m2, and the brightness of black - 0.11 1 cd ^ m2.  As a result, the static contrast was at the level of 2558: 1.  This is a very good result. <br><br>  The color palette of Lenovo Y27g almost completely covered the sRGB range, its coverage was 94.7% - also not bad for a gaming model.  The measured white point was near the reference point D65, which can also be written into the advantages of the Lenovo Y27g Razer Edition. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a91/700/d61/a91700d617a017f472ff97d4ca30ed58.jpg"></div><br>  The average color temperature of the Lenovo Y27g was slightly lower than the reference value of 6,500 K. Simply put, all the colors on the display screen appear blue.  But this disadvantage can be compensated without calibration - with the help of the ‚Äúblue filter‚Äù menu item. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/61e/ea4/2fc/61eea42fcf756799921969135b33b9d5.png"><br><br>  As for the DeltaE color rendering error, its average value was 3.44 units, and the maximum value was 8.66 units.  If we were talking about a professional monitor created for image and video processing, then such parameters could be called large.  However, for a game monitor, which is Lenovo y27g, these values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be called quite acceptable.  In addition, this display parameter, like many others, can be corrected by calibration using a colorimeter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/694/af3/57a/694af357a29dae3d576db04f77f1f3ee.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Conclusion</font>  <font color="#d8291e">Is it possible to live with a curved display?</font> </h2><br>  Lenovo Y27g Razer Edition - Lenovo's good debut in the gaming monitor segment.  This product has everything you need to interest both a gamer and a regular PC user.  It uses * VA matrix, which guarantees a very high static contrast (3000: 1, three times higher than that of a good IPS) and high brightness. <br><br>  In addition, Lenovo Y27g is equipped with all the necessary set of features for games.  With the Lenovo Artery utility, you can display a frame counter, a timer, and a crosshair.  So, the FPS counter and the additional sight perfectly helped the author of these lines in online shooters.  :) Also, do not forget about the support of NVIDIA G-Sync technology, thanks to which you can remove image artifacts such as friezes and gaps from the screen and make the image incredibly smooth.  Of course, G-Sync will only work when using an NVIDIA video card of GeForce GTX 650Ti BOOST level and higher. <br><br>  Now it's time to answer the most important question: is it convenient to live, play and work with a curved screen?  Answer: you can.  The curved screen can only be disturbed when working with CAD and similar programs.  But the game, watching videos or working with the browser does not cause any inconvenience.  As with all good things, getting used to the curved screen does not take much time.  It is possible to get used to Lenovo Y27g in a couple of days, and after it, working with ordinary flat monitors at first will be a little inconvenient and even unusual.  If you have the opportunity to purchase such a display - run to the store without a second thought.  This will probably be one of the best and most interesting of your computer purchases in recent years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399419/</a></p>
