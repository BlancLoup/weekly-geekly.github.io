In the field of production of typical low-cost sites, staffing is one of the key problems.  We need people focused on results, able to act quickly, make decisions, are stress-resistant, attentive to trifles ... and with adequate requests for salary.  That's right, such people are not found.  They need to be taught and cooked. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this article I will touch on two questions.  Let's start with the system of gradation and growth of personnel (growth matrix) and then we will talk about the system of motivation.  All of the following is not a dogma, it is just our experience, which for several years led to high results. <br><br><h3>  Seven WebCanape Belts, or Employee Growth Matrix </h3><br>  ‚ÄúGraduation of people is a thankless task.  Each person needs to be approached individually, ‚ÄùI often hear such comments when I talk about our employee growth system.  It is all so.  Each needs an individual approach, but only after the system of gradation and growth is built and implemented.  What I'm talking about?

      Growth matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa coordinate system for employees, which indicates what kind of salary the employee will receive, when and under what conditions.  To put it another way, this is a system that shows the employee what level he is at and what needs to be done to move on to the next one.  I recommend to introduce this system if developers + line managers become more than 10 people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fb7/5e7/0ad/fb75e70adb4d4c19a2b70a8d262a5eb5.png"><br><br>  If a ‚Äúgreen‚Äù employee comes, then everything is simple.  It starts from the first step and further, achieving results, moves higher and higher.  His qualification grows, the RFP grows and bonuses appear. <br><br>  If you hire an experienced employee, he begins with an intermediate step, so that his expectations in accordance with the RFP correspond to our matrix, but further growth is possible (in most cases) when the indicators of previous steps are reached. <br><br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/1OrktMwK3LGucc">I attach an example of a growth system</a> for site development managers. <br><br>  The RFP is made up of salary, bonuses and additional bonuses: an increase in length of service, an increase in leadership of the group, a ‚Äústar‚Äù.  With the first components, I think everything is clear, but I will explain about the ‚Äústar‚Äù.  This is an extra bonus.  It is expressed in a certain amount of money, which we give out monthly for an interesting solution of work tasks.  A kind of mark for outstanding merit and the ability to show what we value in work. <br><br>  Before you look at the plate with an example of such a matrix, I want to draw attention to the importance of this for one and the other side. <br><br>  <b>Why is it important for a manager?</b>  The manager has a great desire to create a successful company.  Employees have a great desire to earn a lot and grow professionally. <br><br>  The growth matrix should combine a set of conditions, fulfilling which, employees will come to their goal, thereby leading to the goal and the company.  First of all, this matrix contains the motion vector, the company's growth system, without which it is impossible to manage it.  Secondly, with the growth of the team, it is important to maintain transparency in everything.  This eliminates the manager from having to memorize agreements with each employee, protects him from the ability to manage at the level of emotions (good mood - get promoted), etc.  It is also important that the growth matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa phased plan for developing a training program for employees.  Almost every step we have a set of training materials. <br><br>  <b>Why is this important for an employee?</b>  First of all, the employee sees what he can count on, and what responsibility lies with him.  It is important.  He also understands what needs to be done to move on.  Many of our managers from the advertising and promotion department prepare in advance and pass exams for Yandex certification.  For them, this is an opportunity to quickly move to a new level, and for a company it is an increase in the qualifications of the team.  Often, preparation comes from home, and it also saves time. <br><br><h3>  Certification or exams on knowledge of the company's products </h3><br>  Recently, we have implemented certification of management staff (everyone who works with clients) on the knowledge of the products that we develop and implement to our clients.  A manager can be allowed to communicate with clients only if he knows the product that he is offering (in our case, this is a website, advertising and promotion).  He knows the product - he understands how he works in detail, knows how to customize and explain to the client. <br><br>  Certification takes place 2 times a year, as a regular exam.  Two theoretical questions and one practical.  Ticket texts are always available on the server.  Take it and get ready.  If you do not pass the exam, "fall down" a step below.  If you do not pass the second time, the question is raised about your professional suitability and the need for further cooperation. <br><br><h3>  System of motivation or financial incentives </h3><br>  This question is very subtle.  I recommend not copying our experience, carefully look at your team, goals and stage at which you are located, and only after that make a decision: introduce or change the motivation system.  As I mentioned in the previous article ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/333842/">Monitoring the work of the production of a web-studio</a> ‚Äù, WebCanape has a system of performance indicators.  These indicators allow you to monitor the work of the company (at the level of numbers).  The system of motivation allows you to influence them with a certain probability. <br><br>  Next we will talk about the calculation of the premium.  I want to note that the award is a premium - an award for exceptional results.  For a good result, the employee receives a salary, and for an excellent result - a salary + bonus.  Many consider the award to be something natural, taken for granted.  It should not be. <br><br>  <b>Awarding site development managers</b> .  The size of the bonus fund for managers can be determined independently.  For example, as% of profit or turnover.  Between managers, this potential premium (fund) is distributed in the same percentage ratio as their contribution to the total boiler.  Ivanov brought 70% of income, Petrov 30% of income.  So the bonus fund will also be shared.  Every manager has to pass X projects for a month.  This is a condition for receiving a bonus.  If he passed, then he was entitled to a bonus, if not - only a salary.  Next, lowering factors are included if performance indicators are violated.  Take the average coefficients for all projects for the month and multiply.  The formula is simple: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Premium. Fact = Premium. Plan * Regulations * Terms * Review</b> </li><li>  Standards: 100% fulfillment = 1, 90% fulfillment = 0.9, etc. </li><li>  Timing: 100% completion = 1, 90% completion = 0.9, etc. </li><li>  Review: 1.2 - 0 (zero), 3 - 0.8, 4-5 - 1 </li></ul><br>  For a manager to receive 100% of his bonus, all coefficients must be equal to 1. <br>  This is a simplified system relative to that used in WebCanape.  It can balance in one direction or another by introducing coefficients or new indicators that you want managers to pay attention to.  There is an opinion that the motivation system for linear managers should be changed once in 6 months. <br><br>  I showed the organization of the financial motivation system on the example of development managers.  A similar system can be introduced in other departments.  To introduce or not to introduce a bonus system for developers is a big question.  It all depends on what goal you are pursuing.  In WebCanape, a small bonus is allocated to developers, which is distributed by team leaders at their discretion.  This is for them a certain managerial leverage when working with a team. <br><br>  That's all for now.  If you have questions, ask.  In the next issue I will talk about the organization of the work of the technical support department.  And do not forget to click on the up arrow if you like the material.  Like any normal person, it motivates writing further. <br><br>  The list of all materials " <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/309492/">Effective Web Studio</a> " and <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEBjZloMqYgTRq-4aw">telegram-get-together</a> will help you not to get bored.
