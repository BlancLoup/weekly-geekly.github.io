  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I bought a laptop on ebay.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the eve of the summer decided to get an inexpensive bu.  laptop, in case of all sorts of trips, that would always be in business. <br>  I decided to study the market of our city, but since it is suitable B.  the option cost about 400 cu then, for the sake of interest or on the advice I don‚Äôt remember already, jumped on iby. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I was very pleasantly surprised by the prices for used goods.  laptops.  A decent laptop there could be purchased from $ 100, the most interesting thing is that the phones are about the same, at least it‚Äôs not very profitable to buy a phone there. <br><br>  And at the beginning of the summer I found the ‚Äúfirm‚Äù, so I will call it further, which acts as a mediator, and their (firms) mass by the way. <br>  It works like this: we transfer money to her account, then we find a lot, we bet on a lot through our company's website at auction, if this rate is the maximum, then you win the lot and the company pays for it.  Then the lot arrives at a warehouse in the USA, and the company sends it from the warehouse to you, in my case it was a post office. <br>  Well, of course, the Firm takes a small% of the transaction amount + a fixed fee for shipping and storage of the lot. <br>  At the auction, they do not like to send lots outside the US, so the warehouse is located in the states. <br><br>  I chose a laptop, made bets, it did not work for a long time, at first there was little experience in such matters, they had their own pitfalls.  For example, the Firm accepted bids and processed from its website only once a day until 5 pm, which is not very convenient, then they explained to me that they work as follows: you bet the maximum amount you can offer for the lot, and already the company through the program ( whether your parser, or software from ebay itself), will bid 7 minutes before the end of the auction, and if your bid was the maximum, then you won.  Naturally, for good lots it is hard enough to catch.  The company has a high rating, therefore, users trust it.  If you try to buy yourself (newbing rating 0) then this is problematic, but in reality, the company can then pay for the goods on your behalf. <br>  I used the services of the company, they took at that time a little over $ 1.

      In general, I liked the <b>Sony Vaio GRS-700</b> , I won it then for 85 USD  Delivery to the warehouse amounted to 25 cu  Storage in a warehouse 3 cu  And the delivery to Ukraine amounted to about $ 50 + firm services.
