A Canadian startup overturns all submissions and tears up templates. <br><br>  There are stories from which jokes come up automatically.  Therefore, when the startup Ashley Madison announced his plans to go into public form (IPO), only lazy joked about this.

      The site is owned by Avid Life Media, based in Toronto, which has a few more dating sites in the portfolio.  According to reports on Bloomberg and Financial Times, the company is exploring an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Avid Life Media is a dream of investors.  Long-term steady growth, profit and successful internationalization.  According to Forbes, Avid Life's revenue grew by 45% in 2014 to $ 115 million. Everything would be fine if it were not for one ‚Äúbut‚Äù: Ashley Madison does not hide the fact that this is a dating site for unfaithful spouses, in fact, he even notes that in their advertising. <br><br>  As CEO Ashley Madison admits: "When a fellow traveler in an airplane asks me how I earn my living, I lie."  Moral considerations in financial markets are rather illusory, but even here, not everyone is ready to sign up for investments in a startup that facilitates extra-marital affairs. <br><br>  Avid Life has been planning to go public for many years.  Five years ago on the Canadian Stock Exchange, then two years ago with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan American IPO, but now the company seems to have decided to take the chance of a European IPO in London.  According to sources in the company, this is due to the fact that, in the opinion of the company's management in Europe, they are more loyal to infidelity. <br><br>  If you do not go into the legitimacy of such reasoning, and allow their possibility, the company noted other obstacles to the IPO.  Which investment banks are willing to put their name in the avenue?  What analysts are going to write stock recommendations?  What investors, not being afraid of public exposure, will invest money in the company?  All these questions remain open.  Today, private investors Avid Life remain anonymous. <br><br>  Ashley Madison was banned in South Korea until the company filed a lawsuit against the government and prompted the repeal of the law prohibiting adultery.  Startup is still banned in Singapore.  While company commercials are broadcast on some cable channels, civil initiatives are trying to deal with it.  Efforts are intensified every year when the company tries to place ads during the Super Bowl (Super Bowl, the most expensive and viewed ads), as well as other sporting events. <br><br>  Such situations only add obstacles Ashley Madison.  It is not clear how conservative people such as fund investors will treat such a controversial business model. <br><br>  As you can see in the screenshot, a startup in Russia is not available. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289652/</a></p>
