  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to do with angry customers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Harsh words are not always a sign of an existing problem.  Complaints are not always evidence that you are doing something wrong.  Anyway, in order not to bury a huge share of feedback, attach importance to each message.  Often a negative experience can be a salvation and turn into an opportunity.  The ability to assess and correctly address client complaints is the key to this. <br><br>  Polls show that 9 out of 10 times a client will continue to work with you even after your mistake - but only if you have completely corrected the situation for the first time.  Support is not to constantly do things right, but to always be ready to do the right thing.  Here are some guidelines for working with disgruntled customers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Look through the anger at the cause </h4><br>  It is a mistake to assume that, just because someone is screaming like a wild beast, his or her arguments have no reason.  Your job is to search for causes of disagreement. <br>  The main search tool is open and clarifying questions.  Give the client an opportunity not only to throw out emotions, but also to tell in detail about the situation.  Listen to what he says, not what he says. <br>  It may be tempting to ignore the complainants as moody and too sensitive, but then you risk losing genuine and valuable feedback. <br><br><h4>  Fix and organize effective feedback </h4><br>  Free customers always request even more free service.  Requests for new features translate into product requirements.  While helping customers is always right, mindlessly following their requirements is always wrong. <br>  A few messages from different clients with recurring problems are the beginning of the story.  One complaint only raises a red flag, you should think carefully and decide what to do next. <br>  The key is to simply organize the feedback to make it visible.  Give your team an effective way to record meaningful complaints, and you can rest because you never hear about them.

    <h4>  Identify who you are talking to </h4><br>  Here are a few typical customers: <br><br>  <b>Silent</b>  Generally reluctant to talk to you.  He does not want to be a burden or thinks that you will not care about his problems.  Your task is to dig deeper and get to the very heart of the client.  Encourage confidence that he boldly tells you what is going wrong. <br><br>  <b>Aggressive.</b>  Frank and not shy to tell you everything that is on his mind.  Do not give in to provocations and do not mirror the conflict behavior of the client.  Instead, react with firm politeness, but not with humility and resignation - your team also needs respect. <br><br>  <b>Important.</b>  This is your ‚Äúrepresentative‚Äù client, he pays well and requires an appropriate attitude to himself.  While others are happy to hear your apologies, this customer scornfully rejects them.  Mark it as VIP, so that employees know that they have no margin for error when communicating with him. <br><br>  <b>Chronic complainer.</b>  This client will contact you often, and patience is required here because he likes to whimper.  Unlike a vip, he likes apology and sympathy.  Despite constant complaints, if he is satisfied, he will surely sing the praises in front of others. <br><br>  <b>Not bound.</b>  He is not looking for a satisfactory answer, he is trying to get something that he has no right to.  Your answer for him will always be "not good enough."  Keep your composure, respond consistently objectively and confirm the arguments with specific data.  Make sure your organization has done everything possible for the client in the circumstances. <br><br><h4>  Do not be passive-aggressive </h4><br>  ‚ÄúWe are sorry that you are facing this problem,‚Äù this phrase infuriates customers.  This is nothing more than postponing a confession of guilt. <br>  Many use this phrase by chance.  Attempting to apologize sounds like neglect, and all thanks to the wrong tone. <br>  Just apologize.  Even when the complaint has no basis, ask forgiveness directly and clarify how you can solve this problem.  If you come across a hopeless affair, stay friendly, professional and flexible. <br><br><h4>  Switch quickly, but explain why </h4><br>  ‚ÄúStay on the line, I will translate you.  Your call is very important to us. ‚Äù <br>  Awful.  Never miss the opportunity to explain to the client why you are not solving the problem.  It is almost impossible for someone to rejoice in forwarding, but you have two options: <br><br>  1. I will switch you. <br>  2. I am going to connect yours with our specialist who will help you right now. <br><br>  Without this brief but relevant addition, customers will not know that you are really doing ‚Äúthe best‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Use positive vocabulary </h4><br>  Choosing the wrong words, it is easy to sway the mood of the client in a bad way. <br>  Let's look at these two questions: <br><br>  "Maybe something else happened?" <br>  ‚ÄúHow else can I help you?‚Äù <br><br>  By asking question number 1, you activate negative associations with the client.  On the contrary, asking how you can help, you show that you are ready to address the needs of the client. <br><br><h4>  Consider time </h4><br>  The quick response from the desirable turns into the necessary, if we are talking about an angry customer. <br>  It is useful to set up folders where all ‚Äúurgent‚Äù, ‚Äúimportant‚Äù and slightly less than unflattering messages will fall.  Your team will immediately see who needs attention right now. <br>  Be sure to immediately let the client know that you are aware of the problem, understand its importance and name the approximate terms of the decision.  It's great if you give a rationale for these deadlines and share a rough plan of action.  Here you are killing two birds with one stone: reduce the negative and create a safety cushion for you in time according to the motto ‚Äúto promise later, to do it earlier.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Choose the right tone </h4><br>  Beware of extremes in the tone of communication with the client.  Formalism is bad, familiarity is even worse.  Avoid emoticons, if you report something unpleasant, diminutive suffixes are prohibited.  Decide whether you want to be friends with a client or solve his problems. <br><br><h4>  Do not delay the bad job </h4><br>  If a customer wants to cancel his account, do it right now.  Do not attack the client when he tries to leave. <br>  The ability to return the client for exceptional service is a fundamental victory, but when people have one foot in the door, it is better to leave without friction.  Look, if there is a way to solve this problem, and accept as fact if it is not. <br>  If customers cancel their accounts once, it does not mean that they are gone forever.  But do not torment them at the exit, if you are convinced that they will never return. <br><br>  Customer dissatisfaction is a chance to show what you are worth.  Love and store claim cases, they create the history of outstanding service. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285982/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285982/</a></p>
