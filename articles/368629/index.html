  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modern Music: Headphones Overview Sennheiser Momentum 2 on-ear</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Frankly, there are many reasons why I like Sennheiser products.  Legendary brand, attention to detail in the design and production, sound quality, extended warranty on all their products.  Below a certain bar, the legendary German concern does not allow itself to descend not only in the top lines, but also in a completely affordable price segment.  Recall at least <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/sennheiser_hd_598_nakladnye_naushniki_beige/">HD 598</a> or super-popular <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/sennheiser_cx_300_ii_vstavnye_naushniki_black/">CX 300 II</a> - the level of sound quality and assembly for their price I once just hit.  It was all the more interesting for me to take in my hands or, if you like, in my ears, the representative of the new generation Sennheiser - the model <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/sennheiser_momentum_m2_oeg_nakladnye_naushniki_ivory/">Momentum M2 OE</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/105/5b3/516/1055b3516ae3494ca8445fc183118789.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you already understood from the name - headphones are classified as overhead in their form factor.  Probably, now I risk to hear the deaf murmur of experienced audiophiles, who will tell me that in this form factor there can be no good sound in principle, because the size of the drivers will not allow to get a truly ultimatum sound out of them.  But let me, gentlemen ... aren't the big, full-size headphones designed for quiet listening to music at home, along with a glass of good brandy and a Cuban cigar?  And this is a sacred process, which you obviously will not be able to repeat, while on the road or sitting at your office laptop. <br><br>  In-ear'y?  Yes, I agree, the sound of good in-ear headphones allows you to enjoy music regardless of your location, but, firstly, not everyone can do it without a certain discomfort in the ears, and secondly, let's be frank, this sound will cost you much more expensive.  That is why the invoice headphone form factor (on-ear) has become that very trade-off option, which will allow not to lose much in the sound, and not to part with your favorite music.

      In general, as you have probably understood, I will tell you today about this very interesting representative of the Senment of Sennheiser Momentum - Momentum 2 On-Ear models. <br><br>  Just want to make a reservation that I considered this model not only and not so much in terms of sound.  I tried to approach consideration more comprehensively - after all, for representatives of the younger generation of personal audio lovers, in addition to sound, appearance and style are also very important ... Beats will confirm to you! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22b/d61/c63/22bd61c63d9248e0ae15484ce0121663.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">First impression</font> </h2><br>  The first thing that pleased me when opening the box was a cozy velvety bag for storing headphones on the road, which was also supplemented with a nice cloth bag.  To choose, so to speak. <br><br>  The visual headphone inspection pleased us with very good quality materials and workmanship. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0e/9e4/945/e0e9e4945036457ea880ffc26d6cd2b2.jpg"><br><br>  The ear cushions are velvet, the metal headband is trimmed with tanned leather and stitching, pleasant to the touch plastic cups.  The stroke of the fitting to the size of the head of the mechanism is solidly tight, pleasant, without plastic ‚Äúhlip‚Äù, the cable is interchangeable, with the remote control of the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/562/65f/c81/56265fc8185c46a7a6c2051246bd5fd8.jpg"><br><br>  All this I call ‚Äúattention to detail‚Äù. <br><br>  The advantages of headphones during operation look very obvious.  The fit to the size of the head is comfortable, the cups do not put pressure on the ears, the fit is comfortable, which, for overhead headphones, can be safely attributed to tangible benefits.  Velvet, soft ear cushions allow you to wear headphones for a long time.  Ears do not rub and they do not begin to sweat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e5/7d3/f65/1e57d3f65d014904a3c460c98ce806d1.jpg"><br><br>  With my iPhone (and I just got the ‚Äúapple‚Äù version), the headphones normally found a common language, the remote works as it should, the microphone allows you to talk on the street without really raising your voice.  Although, in general, in this respect, I never expect anything supernatural - for me, headphones, even if with a headset, remain primarily a means to listen to music. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Design</font> </h2><br>  The design of the model will delight the modern resident of the metropolis.  It is made in a modern, youth style and clearly speaks about the target audience of headphones.  Holographic laser engravings on cups in the form of a brand logo add brightness and unusualness to it.  In general, bright, stylish, youth ... at the same time, according to senhneiser, quality! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/534/5e6/b44/5345e6b4405c4547839bbff2173cd657.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the youth orientation of Momentum 2 on-ear is clearly visible in the sound.  On the one hand, it is firm, recognizable, Sennheiser‚Äôs - the predominance of bass, calm at the top, on the other hand, it is different in character from the sound of the same 650's.  If the latter have it more classical, then the sound of the Momentum is more ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for electronic and pop music, in other words, for where there is a pronounced beat.  In this case, the bass is very well articulated, does not straddle, does not suppress the rest of the spectrum.  He just prevails, as if slightly dominant, pushing, for example, vocals a little deeper into the background, making live instruments a little less bright in their sound, a little less passionate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/120/1d9/c13/1201d9c13a8f4cb480d55e88bc71f3e7.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Sound</font> </h2><br>  Probably for lovers of jazz and classical this sound may seem unnatural, not bright enough, the dynamic range is not wide enough.  But we must be aware that for these genres of this price segment it is generally very difficult (if not impossible) to find portable headphones that meet all the requirements for sound, and the model in question is initially positioned by manufacturers for another listener.  The reverse and very positive side of this feature of ‚Äúmomentums‚Äù is that the headphones do an excellent job with overload, carefully separating the frequencies, not mixing them into a common musical mess, even at a very decent playback volume.  Moreover, in acoustic compositions, especially where the rhythm is closer to slow, the headphones personally added some dark charm to me, atmospheric sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fe/20b/a77/0fe20ba775cb42f78ede41f4af4def29.jpg"><br><br>  But young people obviously love Momentum M2 OE for their ‚Äúdriving‚Äù or, to put it in automotive language, ‚Äúpickup‚Äù when playing electronic and pop music. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Several technical specifications</font> </h2><br>  Type closed, dynamic <br>  Overhead cushions (Supraaural) <br>  Contact pressure 3.2 N <br>  The frequency range of 16 - 22000 Hz <br>  Maximum sound pressure level (1 kHz, 1 W RMS) 112 dB <br>  Nonlinear distortion factor (1 kHz, 100 dB SPL) &lt;0.5% <br>  18 ohm impedance <br>  1.4 m cable, replaceable <br>  3.5 mm connector, angled <br>  Microphone <br>  The frequency range of 100 - 10000 Hz <br>  Circular orientation <br>  Sensitivity - 44 dB V / Pa <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">findings</font> </h2><br>  As a result, in the face of Momentum M2 On-Ear, we got not just comfortable overhead headphones, but also a stylish youth accessory that allows us to stand out from the crowd, show off our familiarity with a solid brand that has proven itself in the world of personal audio.  The sound itself, however, remains at a very good level for this form factor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a9/32e/da1/4a932eda18044379bd43205a1ebee6a5.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones are designed primarily for lovers of active lifestyle, a lot of traveling, spending a large amount of their time outside the home with portable gadgets to listen to music.  The version in the review is designed for iOS devices, but there is also a universal <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/sennheiser_momentum_m2_oeg_nakladnye_naushniki_black">Momentum M2 OEG</a> , which works with Android and other gadgets. <br><br>  As a stylish youth thing, Momentum 2 on-ear did not lose the inherent firmness and attention to detail inherent to Sennheiser, distinguishing Sennheiser products from many other manufacturers of portable electronics.  Because, as I said above, the Germans never fall below a certain level.  And this bar is very high. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368629/</a></p>
