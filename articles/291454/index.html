The fifth anniversary measurement showed the stabilization of the ratio of positive and negative emotions in public communications of Russian social media users: “The Index of Love” remained at the same level as in the December study. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/713/3d7/702/7133d7702437413383127452717b06f2.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As in previous studies, <b>Russian-language references to “love” and “hatred” from the first person in the present tense were</b> analyzed: positive emotions (for example, <b>“I love”, “I love”, “I am crazy”, “I am happy”</b> , etc. p.) and negative ( <b>“I hate,” “annoys me,” “enrages,” “hate tweet,”</b> etc.).  To determine the messages that meet the above criteria, for a specified period of time, <b>320 million Russian-language messages from 25 million</b> were analyzed.  authors from popular social networks: VKontakte, Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal, Instagram, etc. The research period is <b>May 26 - June 08.</b> <br><br>  During the study period, positive and negative emotions were cumulatively mentioned <b>in 4.6 million messages, of which 80.8% messages were about love and only 19.2% were about hatred</b> .  This ratio is almost the same as winter data.

      For each subject of the Russian Federation, the “Love Index” * was calculated, based on which regions of the most positive and negative can be identified.  At the same time, the “Index of Love” in the regions of Russia reduced the range of values.  If in winter the index changed from 3.0 to 5.5, then in summer the index values ​​fell and vary from <b>2.7 to 5.1</b> .  Nevertheless, it is important to note that according to the measurement results, all the regions of Russia have positive indices greater than 1, i.e.  positive messages are much more than negative. <br><br>  <b>Leading regions:</b> <br>  Leadership in the "Index of Love" was divided by the <b>Republic of Mari El and the Leningrad Region, the index</b> in which amounted to <b>5.1.</b>  They are followed by the <b>Vologda Oblast and the Republic of Karelia with an index of 4.9</b> .  On the fifth line with the index <b>4.8 - Chelyabinsk region</b> .  Slightly lower with the index <b>4.7 - Orenburg region and the Republic of Tatarstan.</b> <br><br>  <b>Regions with the lowest “Love Index” value:</b> <br>  Among the regions with the smallest Love Index, no significant changes have occurred.  On the 85th line of the rating is the <b>Chechen Republic with an index of 2.7</b> .  On the 84th line - the <b>Republic of Dagestan with an index of 2.9</b> , on the 83rd - the <b>Republic of Ingushetia with the index of 2.9.</b>  <b>The Kabardino-Balkarian Republic index - 3.1 and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) - 3.0</b> , - retained their positions almost unchanged - 82nd and 81st lines, respectively. <br><br>  The most significant rotations in changing positions occurred in regions with an average “Love Index”. <br><br>  <b>Growth leaders:</b> <br>  The growth leader in the number of positions in the ranking was the <b>Nenets Autonomous District</b> , with an index of <b>4.4 the</b> region <b>climbed 48 lines</b> and took the 25th place.  In most reports, residents of the Nenets Autonomous District express emotions in relation to their loved ones: “confess their love” to parents and children, rejoice at meetings with friends, negative emotions are also associated primarily with family troubles and everyday problems.  According to the experience of previous studies, such concentration of emotions on the family is usually associated with improvements in the general social environment in the region — while improving the quality of life, people are more open to the public display of positive emotions. <br><br>  <b>The Tyumen region</b> with the index of 4.5–17th place in the rating <b>rose by 33 lines</b> , the <b>Moscow region</b> with the index of <b>4.4</b> <b>rose by 30 positions</b> and took the 27th line, and the <b>Novgorod region</b> with the same index <b>- 4.4, added 28 lines</b> and occupied the 23rd a place. <br><br>  <b>Negative dynamics:</b> <br>  The negative dynamics persisted in <b>the Altai Republic, the region index was 4.1, the drop in the rating was 52 lines</b> and moved Altai from the traditional leaders to 55th place in the rating.  Such a dramatic change in position may be due to the deteriorating traffic situation in the region.  The onset of spring, obviously, exacerbated problems with the quality of roads in the Republic and led, among other things, to several major road accidents.  The situation was also noticed by the head of the region, who held a meeting with representatives of the road sector in early June and urged them to check and improve the quality of road maintenance, as well as traffic safety and the condition of adjacent territories. <br><br>  Also serious falls of the “Index of Love” were recorded in the <b>Vladimir region - an index of 4.2</b> , a <b>decrease</b> in the rating <b>by 43 lines, the</b> <b>Republic of Adygea (3.8) - minus 42 positions and the Jewish Autonomous Region (4.2) - minus 38 positions.</b> <br><br>  It should be noted that after the winter growth of the Index of Love, a significant decrease in positions is observed <b>in Sevastopol</b> - an index of <b>4.1, minus 31 position</b> and 50th place in the ranking.  The decrease in the index is associated with a significant number of negative reports about the increase in prices from residents of the region. <br><br>  Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the regions that showed a drop in the index remain in the middle positions of the rating. <br>  An important indicator of the study is the "Index of Love" for the country as a whole.  In all previous studies, we have observed a steady increase in positive in Russia.  In the first study, published in June 2013, the Index of Love for Russia as a whole was 2.6.  Steadily over the past two years, the index has increased, setting a record in the winter of 2015 - during this period it was 4.3.  And today we are seeing the index at the same high level - 4.2. <br><br>  <b>“Love Index” by regions of Russia</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/320/551/170/320551170ae548ae8341534b04bc1d65.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0b/447/7e4/e0b4477e446545caa6b54567855f362f.jpg"><br><br>  Interactive map "Index of Love" regions of Russia: <a href="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/lyubov-i-nenavist-na-karte-rossii-leto-2015-issledovanie-emocionalnogo-sostoyaniya-35-mln-polzovatelej-socialnyx-media/">br-analytics.ru/blog/lyubov-i-nenavist-na-karte-rossii-leto-2015-issledovanie-emocionalnogo-sostoyaniya-35-mlnpolzovatelej-socialnyx-media</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291454/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291454/</a></p>
