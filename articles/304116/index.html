For this, I did not need to engage in dialogue with them.  I did not even try to establish visual contact with any stranger from the crowd in order to understand what was on his mind ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcb/d50/f42/bcbd50f42b5a4ed59b9b64af42c50740.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  <b>By the way, if you use Figma</b> , I recommend paying attention to our <b><a href="https://setproduct.com/">ready-made design systems</a></b> .

      What you read above may be a chapter from a science fiction novel.  And perhaps - very near future.  As soon as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">augmented reality</a> becomes an integral part of our life, it remains to be guessed.  However, it is known that the giants of the industry have long been exploring this trend.  Nowadays, attempts are known to supplement the objects around us through the screen of your smartphone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df6/fc7/f33/df6fc7f33c3a4de986db3965f5fd90d6.png"><br><br>  After that, only a small time step will remain until the moment when you can also point the camera at the crowd of pedestrians and find out the status of a person, see his profile, find out the type of activity and so on. <br><br>  Then, after a relatively short time, the developers will realize that this is at least antisocial - constantly pointing the camera at strangers.  And then, Google Glass, will be your way out!  Or it will be a way out for another decisive innovator's gadget who will direct the development of social networks in a new direction.  However, this article is not about high-tech development - Google glasses, which are now perhaps a little ahead of their time.  (Do you recall, by the way, when the first electric car was invented? It was a similar story in advance. I had to wait about a hundred years until it was leveled.) <br><br>  This article is a fantasy rather about what future social networks can expect using augmented reality technologies.  Likely scenario how people might begin to ‚Äúinteract without interacting‚Äù! <br><br><h1>  Case "crowd" </h1><br>  In my recent vision, I most likely had glasses.  Maybe I had a lens with a sensor.  Or perhaps something else that ‚Äúrendered‚Äù to me a minimalistic block with information over each passer-by's head.  This text may have been dictated into a highly sensitive microphone, or perhaps it was written manually through the application.  I see which track is listening to that young man in a bright shirt.  ‚ÄúAwesome choice!‚Äù - I thought and winked at him when our distance was reduced.  The next passer is in a hurry somewhere.  ABOUT!  The status above him says that he has a birthday today ... "Congratulations to you," I quickly blurted out, having had time to notice, out of the corner of my eye, how he broke into a smile.  And there is that girl in the distance ... Judging by her status, she is not against getting acquainted.  But even if I do not decide, right now you can look at her profile.  The integration of augmented reality with a social network now allows it.  Who is this stranger? ... Where are you from and where are you in such a hurry? <br><br>  Submitted?  The interaction and socialization of people has every chance to reach a new level in this case.  And it was just a case about how I just walk down the street in a crowd, meeting people with a variety of goals, interests and states: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08a/c2f/cc3/08ac2fcc3d744b79aa3ecd56a95b4f66.png"><br><br><h1>  Case "services" </h1><br>  How to choose the best service provider in real life?  How to find the best deals around without wasting time?  Imagine yourself in the market, with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables.  It seems that everyone has the same tomatoes, the same apple varieties and so on.  You go around the market, get information, bargain, don't negotiate, move on.  In the end, after a certain amount of time you go out shopping.  Now imagine yourself in the same market, but you can see the best offers from sellers, attractive offers, like in the palm of your hand.  And all this thanks to the integration of AR with the social network.  The status of this seller reads: ‚ÄúI have Baku tomatoes at 150r.  Best price".  The status of the second reads: "Every 3rd buyer will receive a bonus."  And there the seller offers "try strawberries before buying."  Thanks to this concept, your trajectory of movement in the market is optimized: it will take a minimum of time and you will walk only on those sellers who have the best offers of the goods you are interested in. <br>  The struggle for the customer will intensify, the sellers will have to improve the quality of services and offers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a81/f1a/40e/a81f1a40ea3c481781724c5698f75d70.png"><br><br><h1>  Case "communication" </h1><br>  In places of rest, if the person is located to the contact, it is possible to find a live companion of interest.  From now on, any single person having come, for example, to a bar can place his status that he is just waiting for someone and is not ready for new contacts.  Or write that he wants to discuss yesterday's sporting event.  Or just try to find people with similar interests.  And someone wants the status of attracting the attention of the waiter, so as not to scream through the entire hall.  And if you go further, the waiter can now take the order remotely!  I saw the status of a new visitor from a distance, sent an order to the kitchen, sent a confirmation to the client: ‚ÄúYour order is completed, expect your dishes in 10 minutes, have a pleasant rest.‚Äù  It is also an opportunity to make casual useful acquaintances and a variant of a panacea for people who prefer to live in a virtual world, creating the image they need. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a59/45d/a82/a5945da82aba411eb390c42da83b5bbd.png"><br><br><h1>  Case "conference" </h1><br>  This is the juice!  Imagine any conference, mitap or the like.  After the presentations by the speakers, listeners are eagerly awaiting a coffee break to <s>eat and</s> chat with speakers or other listeners.  Someone is looking for developers, someone is investing, someone just wants to collect opinions about the usefulness of their startup.  People get into the circulation of communication, with the hope of establishing profitable business contacts.  Although between many and there is an exchange of business cards, but most of them later end up in the urn.  But as soon as augmented reality moves into the world of social networks, such problems will no longer arise.  Now you just take a coffee and a sandwich, and the status above you clearly makes it clear to people around you what business connections you are looking for: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a83/6cb/af4/a836cbaf4cf94c3189a27c752d816a97.png"><br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1><br>  I could come up with enough cases to immerse you deeper into my vision.  I could come up with interaction with statuses in the workplace, in an average office.  Could describe how such a system would connect to a fitness / health bracelet and in the event of deterioration would change the status of a person.  Thus, it would be noticeable to others that he is probably in trouble and needs help or calling an ambulance.  But I sincerely believe now that this concept of ‚Äúinteraction without interaction‚Äù can have enormous potential and make life easier for people.  Just as developers try to simplify their applications, optimize user scripts in their systems, and the like. <br><br>  After all, the future, as you remember, is somewhere near ... <br><br>  And what cases of integration of social networks and augmented reality do you represent? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304116/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304116/</a></p>
