      Andrei also gave <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/it/news/7435/">an interview</a> in which he told what role AI systems play in the work of the ‚Äúsmart tape‚Äù.  This feed personalizes the content displayed to the user in the feed, taking into account the type of platform (mobile or desktop), geography and time to read the news. <br><br>  In addition to the ITMO VKontakte Olympiad, our university works with a social network and in other areas.  For example, ITMO University traditionally <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/university_live/leisure/news/7727/">participates in VK Fest</a> , arranging its interactive zone on the site.  In the framework of the festival in 2018, we organized a lecture hall at the University of Children, where teachers taught children and their parents about science at the university.  Also presented an interactive trampoline with a machine vision system.  When a person jumps on this trampoline, the speed and height of his jump is duplicated by the hero of a computer game climbing on virtual platforms. <br><br>  Our students participate not only in festivals held by VKontakte, but also various hackathons.  For example, they participate in VK Hackathon, which has been held since 2015.  By the way, one of the first competitions was held at ITMO University, and as part of <a href="https://vk.com/hackathon">VK Hackathon 2018, the</a> best <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/startups_and_business/initiative/news/8034/">app was</a> <a href="https://vk.com/app6747702%3Frun_hash%3D921db37df00a68dcf4">VK Donors</a> blood donor <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/startups_and_business/initiative/news/8034/">application</a> developed by our students. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/education/cooperation/news/7241/">InfoWatch opens training center at ITMO University</a> </h5><br>  At the beginning of 2018, we, together with the Russian developers of information security products InfoWatch, opened a new training center - ITMO ‚Äì Infovotch.  In it, ITMO students will be taught the intricacies of monitoring data leaks in companies and writing reviews on exploits. <br><br>  Our collaboration with InfoWatch is not limited to a learning center.  For example, we have been <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/education/official/news/7874/">organizing the</a> Olympiad ‚ÄúI am a Professional‚Äù for several years already (we have prepared a separate series of articles on the directions of this Olympiad: about <a href="https://habr.com/company/spbifmo/blog/430642/">photonics</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/company/spbifmo/blog/426661/">robotics</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/company/spbifmo/blog/429346/">big data</a> ).  InfoWatch also oversees the master's program on Security of Cyber-Physical Systems, and the company's specialists regularly <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/education/trend/news/7256/">hold</a> lectures at the university. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ga/9t/01/ga9t01yqs_02htrtsw1zbshw4p8.jpeg"><br><br><h5>  <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/education/cooperation/news/7597/">ITMO University and JetBrains: launch a joint master's program</a> </h5><br>  This is the Software Development program, in which representatives of JetBrains will conduct a number of courses: algorithms, programming, in-depth training and image analysis. <br><br>  In addition to undergraduates, JetBrains participate in the preparation of our bachelors.  Employees of the company read courses in the disciplines "Programming Languages" and "MO". <br><br>  Also, the JetBrains team constantly shares its experience in open lectures for teachers and students.  For example, the head of the .NET development department Sergey Kuks recently <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/startups_and_business/initiative/news/8064/">told</a> how JetBrains organized business processes, and our graduate and co-author of the Kotlin language, Andrei Breslav, <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/startups_and_business/business_success/news/8040/">explained</a> how to create a new nuclear program and not ‚Äúburn out‚Äù at work. <br><br><hr><h2>  Telecommunication companies </h2><hr><br><h5>  <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/startups_and_business/initiative/news/7919/">‚ÄúEverything is moving towards digitizing the physical world.‚Äù</a> </h5><br>  ITMO University is actively working with Rostelecom PJSC on several fronts at once.
