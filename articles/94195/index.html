Think this is all over?</i>  <i>No matter how wrong!</i> <br><br>  A few years ago, the Elemental Games team, the creator of games around the Cosmic Ranger Universe, went through hard times: many people left for Katauri Interactive.  However, even then on the official forum, information about the start of work on the new Star Time project (Time of the Stars) slipped. <br>  Over time, it was decided to launch another game, Empire, a space tactical browser strategy with a top view and a free-to-play system. <br><br>  In this post I will try to give some information on both projects.  Go!  :)

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Empire </h4><br><br>  If you want to immediately rush into the pool of the game - you can not read the text further and go to the site <a href="http://elementalgames.com/">elementalgames.com</a> and right now take part in the open beta test. <br><br>  Are you here?  Then I will say a few words about the game, its development and future plans. <br><br>  <b>Lyrics</b> <br><br>  Work on the project began in November 2009. The programming of the game all this time has been done by one person - Alexey ‚Äúdab‚Äù Dubovoy, the general director of EG.  Together with him, his deputy, Alexander ‚ÄúAce‚Äù Smirnov, who works on texts, concepts and other related things, is working in Moscow.  In March 2010, Voronezh game designer Artemy "Carnage" Radchenko and your humble servant, Petersburg scriptwriter and novice programmer, Alexander "Flash" Gorbunov joined the team. <br><br>  I‚Äôll say the phenomenal: Aleksey, being a C programmer, began to learn Flash and Action Script 3 right in the course of development, in November 2009. So you can say that Empire is also a product of learning the language and environment of Adobe Flash. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/5905/scr1nt.jpg" alt="Empire Browser Space Rangers Online: Beta Test"></a> <br><br>  <b>Game concept</b> <br><br>  At the heart of the game is a tactical strategy.  A feature of games from Elemental Games was the lack of direct game analogs.  So this time, I find it difficult to give examples of similar games: in the Empire there is something from Civilization, something from ordinary FPS, something from Heroes of Might and Magic ... In general, it's easier to play and decide :) <br><br>  The task of the player is simple - to create a powerful empire, capturing and holding the planet.  Other players who want to expand their possessions and the arrival of resources, as well as old friends from the first part of the Space Rangers, the Klisans, will interfere with this.  The plans, of course, are even more fun - Dominators, building their own empires and attacking players' empires. <br><br>  To help the player during the game, a fleet is called up, which is built up in the capital and planets equipped with a shipyard (there are five types of ships to choose from, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, the fleet has to be combined), flagships, powerful ships with your personal captains, and bases that are built in the orbits of the planets.  Also at your disposal is a game chat, in which you can make allies, conclude game agreements with them (breaking the contract and betrayal is a common thing, everything is like in life) and so on and so forth. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/1356/scr2f.jpg" alt="Empire Browser Space Rangers Online: Beta Test"></a> <br><br>  <b>Server</b> <br><br>  At the moment there are four servers in the game.  Two of them - Andromeda and Ursa Major, where the first - the cruel world crowded by experienced players and the second - while a bit more free and relatively quieter, work as usual.  The other two, Octant and Omega Centauri, are restarted every 4 hours and 3 days, respectively, zeroing the achievements of the players, so there is an opportunity to quickly try the game, get comfortable and go to the server with an unlimited lifetime of the empire. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/3681/scr3p.jpg" alt="Empire Browser Space Rangers Online: Beta Test"></a> <br><br>  <b>Payment</b> <br><br>  I have no doubt that this question is already spinning in your head as you read the text.  In order not to turn comments into a battlefield for the right to accuse EG of trying to squeeze more money out of the players, I will say right away. <br><br>  Yes, already at the stage of the open beta test, there is an opportunity to purchase some perks via the free-to-play system.  No wonder, players create a very powerful load on the servers and channels, the company needs funding for both the employees' home refrigerator and the project in development, Time of the Stars, and payment for the work of outsourcers-artists, for example.  Here, I think, I will not reveal any new continents to anyone.  So, what can you buy for real money: <br><br>  The injectors are special "amplifiers" that slightly increase the empire's resources, allow you to build four flagships with captains (without an injector - only one), allow you to teleport troops through Allied scientific bases, increase the time of the planetary shield, allow you to explore low-level technologies and so on.  Also available is a common 30-day injector, which includes all the others.  Its cost is 350 rubles. <br><br>  Also, real money can be spent on such a thing as a planetary shield, which will slow down the speed of the battle with the enemy on your planets.  The planetary shield consumes not only rubles (although, rather, a penny), but also the modules, the resource on which the ships are built. <br><br>  Closing the question of payment, I will say that this scheme was not created from a good life, and funding is urgently needed for the development of the Time of Stars.  In the fall, I will only say that no, a thick wallet will not allow you to take a leading position in the game under any circumstances.  The player who has not invested a penny in the game easily replays the one who does not have a sufficient tactical and strategic mind, but bought everything that you can buy. <br><br>  <b>Beta testing</b> <br><br>  An important point of all the above - a beta test. <br>  Yes, there are bugs in the game.  Sometimes even critical. <br>  Yes, the game is still crashing, although new hardware is being purchased and channels are expanding. <br>  And finally, yes, the game and the site's engine are still approaching the release version, hundreds of features are still waiting to be implemented. <br>  So it turns out that the audience of the game and the site with us going through all the stages of the development of the game. <br>  But, believe me, the team is trying to bring the sweet moment of the end of the beta test closer in every way and meet the players' expectations. <br><br>  Ready to rate the game yourself?  Then welcome to <a href="http://elementalgames.com/">elementalgames.com</a> , register for free, play, chat and feel at home! <br><br><h4>  Stars Time </h4><br><br>  Official information on this project a little.  In the public domain, there is a <a href="http://elementalgames.com/st_about%3Fb%3D2%26lang%3DRus">page about the game</a> on the official website, as well as <a href="http://elementalgames.com/st_scr%3Fb%3D2%26lang%3DRus">two screenshots</a> : <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://elementalgames.com/scr/st_scr_00_small.jpg" alt="Star Time - Space Rangers Online, MMO"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://elementalgames.com/scr/st_scr_01_small.jpg" alt="Star Time - Space Rangers Online, MMO"></a> <br><br>  Of course, this is not a production version, but only an alpha build. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have the right information to tell.  You already see that this is a client MMO :) <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and see you in the game! <br><br>  PS If you have any questions, you can ask them not only in the comments, but also in the game itself or on the forum, where my nickname is Flash.  Mail, flash@snk-games.com is also available.  If it doesn‚Äôt make it difficult for you, then try to introduce yourself and let me know how you know me in person;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94195/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94195/</a></p>
