It made me think about playing with the resume data myself.  Especially since I have a little more.  I chose the most interesting area for me, which can be specified in the summary, - ‚ÄúInformation technology, Internet, telecom‚Äù. <br><br>  Under the cat you will find a lot of graphs on which you will learn how many people get in various IT specializations, graduates of which universities want the most money, which employers have the IT people who are slowed down the least, whether Google users earn more than Yandex or Mail users, and a lot of other information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gp/wp/oa/gpwpoayk3oep2qvlixmnjzzg3rg.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Everything described below is just my vision of how it should be.  Graphics do not claim to be completely objective and reflect the real situation.  I could make a mistake anywhere.

      I took Russian resumes from the Information Technologies, Internet, Telecom trade union, which were updated over the past year.  Further, for all graphs, it should be borne in mind that the indicators below are not an absolute cut across the country, but only for the part that is present on hh.ru.  It may be offset. <br><br>  In total, 566,178 IT pros participate in the analysis.  All graphics are clickable. <br><br><h3>  Number of people in the specialization </h3><br>  Up to three specializations can be chosen in the ‚ÄúInformation Technologies, Internet, Telecom‚Äù professional area.  The graph shows how many people have chosen which specialization: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fu/8r/2m/fu8r2myh_am8s1jgtchtslpmb24.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  How many people hide the desired salary </h3><br>  When creating a resume, you can not specify your patch.  As we see, about 40% of IT people use this. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3q/w9/ax/3qw9axdbiljwm7ot11pzu9ez4uw.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  Distribution of males and females by specialization </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bq/zz/ti/bqzzti__uobt-n3b7ae5zh3ifc4.png"></a> <br>  Overweight men in IT is no surprise.  Why are so few women - system administrators, networkers and leading techies? <br><br><h3>  Distribution of desired salary by specialization </h3><br>  Well, now let's see how much money men and women want in different specializations throughout Russia. <br><br>  The next chart is boxplot, or in our opinion, a box with a mustache.  It reads like this.  The dash inside the box is the median.  That is, half of the people get more than this amount, and the other half - less.  The value of the median I tried to sign on almost all the charts.  The box is an interquartile range (IQR) and includes 50% of all resumes: from 1st quartile (25%) to 3rd quartile (75%).  In other words, 25% of resumes want less money than the left border of the drawer, and 25% want more money than the right border of the drawer.  The whiskers limit almost all other data: 0.35% of all resumes want less money than the left border, and 0.35% want more than the right usa border.  All those who did not enter the specified intervals are outliers and are marked by separate dots. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/af/-b/kb/af-bkbt6asisa28un8yzo1itccu.png"></a> <br><br>  It's no secret that in Moscow and St. Petersburg there are more IT people than in other regions of our country, and the level of payment there is above the national average.  Therefore, I have made separate schedules for these cities with the distribution of wages by specialization. <br><br><h3>  Distribution of salaries by specialization in Moscow </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zw/n0/dx/zwn0dxnjp2qknmtjhwbs02htu2a.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  Distribution of salaries by specialization in St. Petersburg </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ix/rx/an/ixrxanjcettxbokkiljkzkd0sju.png"></a> <br>  On all three graphs, the same expectations for monetary compensation between men and women can be seen from testers.  By the way, girls go to this IT area more eagerly than to many others. <br><br>  It is worth noting that in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the female median is higher for technical chiefs.  But if you look at the distribution schedule for the number of men and women in this specialty, it is clear that the second is much smaller. <br><br><h3>  IT salaries in Russia in comparison with other professional areas </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sr/kn/dm/srkndm-lzzczvpt15cozo72nkzy.png"></a> <br><br>  We see that IT specialists are second only to raw material extraction, consulting and top management in terms of salary.  In 24 out of 28 professional areas, women want less money (by median).  In the rest - equally. <br><br><h3>  Distribution of IT professionals by region </h3><br>  Once again, I‚Äôll clarify that the graph does not reflect the actual distribution of IT specialists in the country, but only those summaries that are on hh.ru.  The level of use of the site in the regions is different. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ue/up/cx/ueupcxxsdga4zxyrslzbay8vw90.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  How many resumes per vacancy </h3><br>  For this schedule, I received all active vacancies and resumes that were updated during the year, and for each region I divided the number of resumes by the number of vacancies.  I also excluded regions where the number of IT people is less than 1000. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ou/ug/pm/ouugpmbctqrny5xfs8qkv-mv_om.png"></a> <br><br>  It can be seen that the Moscow Region took the lead.  It does not include Moscow itself.  Most likely, this is because a lot of IT people, especially visitors, are settled on the periphery, and the work is mostly in the city itself. <br><br><h3>  The percentage of IT-resume of the total number of resumes </h3><br>  In the following graph, I calculated the percentage of the total number of resumes in this region that IT professionals occupy. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yd/wh/gu/ydwhgupozx-lfupxtm0k9izugb4.png"></a> <br><br>  An interesting difference between St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region and Moscow and the Moscow Region.  Most likely, this is due to the presence in the MO of such large hangouts for IT people like Mytishchi, Khimki, Lyubertsy and others that belong to the region, but close to the city. <br><br><h3>  Distribution of desired salary in IT by region </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ik/gd/bi/ikgdbi08btqgr5t_azx6wwijg7k.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  Most Popular Key IT Skills </h3><br>  In the summary, you can specify key skills.  The following graph shows the top selected skills for all IT people. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a0/qu/wb/a0quwb9xb_pry_t0bhyd9olhlii.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  Key skills for programming, development </h3><br>  It is interesting to see the main key skills for developers only. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t8/ap/rp/t8aprp2vpymtby_ezrhiinf4zvc.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  Key Skills for Career Start Specialization </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zc/qu/sc/zcquscuqlmwnvzdjvjbbl9sg5jo.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  Distribution of cash expectations by key skills </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/_s/am/kn_samv7qgk13ssasp2b6we7gfw.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  Age distribution by IT specialization </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jq/sr/ev/jqsrevk4zxn7igm4pks-xogdoqk.png"></a> <br>  Young people often go to the web and toys.  I think this is a great entry point to IT. <br><br><h3>  Dependence of salary on work experience </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rz/tg/my/rztgmykjwtm0yu_sxyrpe7hqlqo.png"></a> <br><br>  The order is broken only by those who have worked for more than 20 years.  Most likely, this is because there are many people in this category who have come to IT from another area.  As in the resume, people often like to indicate not only the relevant experience of this trade area. <br><br><h3>  Distribution of summaries by visibility status </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cs/uc/jd/csucjdvpmgkvonmfehzn8prbdrm.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  Preferred travel time </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lp/lf/sl/lplfslwwkumxq3_h2xfsr6brlpi.png"></a> <br><br>  Most indicate that the time spent on the road to work does not matter.  In St. Petersburg and Moscow, people are somewhat more deeply aware of this ‚Äúit does not matter‚Äù and therefore they choose this item less often. <br><br><h3>  Nearest metro station </h3><br>  In the summary, you can specify the nearest metro station.  Let's see for Moscow, where the most people. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1f/pj/xf/1fpjxfeg0chlbccua8lsavlirwo.png"></a> <br><br>  I did not find an easy way to put a text label in the Python gmap, therefore the stations marked with markers are marked separately: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z0/d6/5o/z0d65ojnyx45nie0k-q-1upkxrk.png"></a> <br><br>  Most of these stations are the main points of entry into the city from crowded, crowded places. <br><br><h3>  What cellular operators do IT-users use? </h3><br>  I downloaded <a href="http://www.rossvyaz.ru/activity/num_resurs/registerNum/">the DEF code base</a> on the Rossvyaz website, combed it a bit and matched it with the phone numbers from the resume. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hk/ah/mz/hkahmz5d7l33bgkqdj7t7vj19yq.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  Which email is used </h3><br>  For the given schedule I have united various domains of one company in one group.  By the way, a curious fact, which is not visible on the graph, about Yandex. Mail, that the overwhelming majority indicate in the email-address the domain yandex.ru, and not ya.ru <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-5/y0/ol/-5y0olr8d8glpysvlzammvjz_lu.png"></a> <br><br>  I have always believed that the coolest guys use Gmail, the middle ones use Yandex, and the rest use Mail.ru.  Now let's see what salary expectations will be in these three groups. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ww/ep/oy/wwepoyl3aowbjschtos-cevb0_i.png"></a> <br><br>  So guys, if you want more money, you know what to do. <br><br><h3>  Distribution of desired salary at universities </h3><br>  Well, now let's see what high school graduates want the most money.  I sifted out all the institutions where less than 1,000 people from the sample studied. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ao/dm/em/aodmemd3rgwgm56obtlaxqiao9g.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  In which companies people work the longest </h3><br>  In work experience, you can specify the duration of work in this company.  I took everything that more than 500 IT people went through. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v-/pt/jn/v-ptjnbkpvxhzyfvbvsocq9u5tk.png"></a> <br><br>  It is seen that not very IT organizations come across.  This is because work experience indicates not only relevant experience. <br><br><h3>  Distribution of desired salary with experience in the company </h3><br>  Let's see, people with experience in which companies want the most money.  Take Moscow and Peter separately. <br><br>  Moscow: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hg/1h/q5/hg1hq5klhnufu3so0weeuueojwu.png"></a> <br><br>  St. Petersburg: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gi/-7/oa/gi-7oadf4wk_rrsu-_mfaoien_o.png"></a> <br><br>  In the process of drawing graphs, I had more and more new ideas of what could be done more, but I decided to dwell on what is.  If this post goes well, I will continue. <br><br>  They helped me in drawing graphs: <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> , <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a> , <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> , <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a> , <a href="https://hive.apache.org/">Apache Hive</a> and others. <br><br>  Ask questions. <br>  Thanks to all. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : I cleaned the last three schedules a bit by combining different spellings of the same organization </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344724/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344724/</a></p>
