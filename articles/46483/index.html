There was no wi-fi in the device, and this flaw was corrected.  Like many others, this laptop has a mini-PCI connector, which was occupied by an analog modem card.  I parted with a modem without any regrets, replacing it with a Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g card from Intel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/02c/e53/c77/02ce53c77ce99dbda9f0b273a9efe39d.jpg"><br><br>  Fortunately, an integrated 802.11 antenna was present on this laptop.  This implementation of the wireless network certainly turned out to be more accurate than sticking out of PCMCA or USB caused. <br>  However, if you pay attention to the photo of the board, you will see that there are two mini-coaxial connectors.

      In modern laptops of the corresponding level, two antennas are integrated.  The Wi-Fi controller's hardware and software bundle automatically selects the antenna whose signal level is higher.  In my ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù of wireless networks, the antenna was only one, respectively, an unused connector beckoned my playful hands, like a donkey carrot.  I was eager to make a connector for a discrete Wi-Fi antenna on a fujik.  Over the place for the connector did not have long to think.  I also have an unused RJ-11 from the modem, which for a long time settled in a box with unnecessary hardware.  Fortunately for me and unfortunate for my good friend, his D-Link router DI-824VUP + antenna connector burned down and it was equipped with a suitable mini-coaxial cable.  Hand work is reduced to the mechanical fastening of the connector on the case and connecting the cable to the controller.  Voila!  We got an external antenna on the laptop.  Cases of bygone days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/75c/915/58d/75c91558de15b22e31f73aadb1a0a4db.jpg"><br><br>  Now in my hands the cult tablet Samsung Q1 Ultra, which has undergone the same modification. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c29/9c7/5a9/c299c75a96e5e4692e00241892145d50.jpg"><br><br>  The process was not much different.  The wireless network is implemented by a miniature module, which also has two connectors, of which only one is involved.  Another burning router (Glory to D-Link - the best supplier of Wi-Fi connectors for sufferers!) And the file in your hands is the key to a successful upgrade of the tablet.  On the case there is just a suitable technological connector with a plug, which was probably planned for some kind of antenna (cellular network or digital television - known only to Samsung engineers).  The connector and the hole had to earn a bit of a file, and as a result we have this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/301/d34/84a/301d3484aa6c63e6e924ad9266928d18.jpg"><br><br>  A standard router antenna significantly improves signal quality.  But which of us will stop at what has been accomplished?  The external connector is so good that the antennas can be connected different.  The variety of antennas is so great that they can devote not only a whole series of articles, but also a significant period of their life.  However, the general points should be covered.  Antennas are divided into internal ones - those that are attached directly to access points or Wi-Fi controllers (don't be fooled by what they are called ‚Äúinternal‚Äù, meaning that they are installed indoors), and external ones installed on the street, on the roof or wall of the room.  We are interested in the first group.  Indeed, for a Wi-Fi spy, along with the sensitivity of a Wi-Fi receiver, mobility is important.  This group includes directional and omnidirectional antennas.  It is easy to guess that the first ones provide long range in a certain direction, while the second ones cover all directions well.  An omnidirectional antenna is good to use in order to detect all the grids in the surrounding area, and a directional antenna - in order to provide a good signal from a specific access point.  An antenna is characterized by a gain factor in units of dBi: the more, the better (I will keep silence about the radiation pattern, but I‚Äôm afraid that an overdose of information can happen for one time).  However, enough theory.  Rummaging through the Internet, and then shopping, I became the owner of two antennas: the directional D-Link DWL-R60AT and the omnidirectional company Planet with the simple name 5dbi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e9c/276/b0a/e9c276b0a9f9923b079ed1bb9e9608df.jpg"><br><br>  in the photo from left to right: a remote mount, Planet antennas, D-Link, ‚Äúa conventional Wi-Fi antenna‚Äù <br><br>  I did not get beyond the limit of gain - only 6 and 5 dBi, respectively.  But on the other hand, I got both antennas for a completely affordable amount: about 800 rubles.  Planet antenna comes with a nice bonus in the form of a remote mount with cable.  With it, you can install the antenna in a convenient place, for example on the roof of a car, since the mount is equipped with a magnet.  Check out the device with this antenna: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eed/3c7/be9/eed3c7be9bcb3c251e5c98db5e0ba3cc.jpg"><br><br>  Looks serious. <br>  I conduct a rapid test in the kitchen, behind two concrete walls from my access point.  I use standard means of Windows and I make measurements in sticks.  Without an antenna, there are three sticks, with an antenna from a burnt router, four, and with new antennas, five sticks each.  Well, it is clear that the money was not wasted.  It is time to take a walk and take tests in the fresh air.  Let's see how far our antennas allow us to move away from the access point. <br>  So that the tests were as close to reality as possible: my own honored DI-824VUP +, which has faithfully served for more than 4 years and largely rehabilitates D-Link, worked with its staff antenna in my apartment on the 9th floor. <br>  Standing under my windows (1) without an external antenna, I was able to connect to my wireless network.  The free option from the burnt router gave me this opportunity, and having connected, I successfully pinged the router, but there was no way to go further.  Omnidirectional antenna allowed me to retire a little further.  (2) With the D-Link directional antenna, I moved as far as the terrain in front of the house allowed me (3), but the rather high level of the signal made me continue my research. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/955/8df/298/9558df2980773c6d8dee29e9b8e8f121.jpg"><br><br>  I went up to the 14th floor of the house opposite (4) and, to my surprise, I was able to connect to my network and ping the router.  The signal level showed that this is the maximum distance that can be achieved with this equipment, but even this, according to maps.yandex.ru, is an impressive 300 c over meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a6/fcf/7d2/1a6fcf7d2ada8344a1f33f5a969453cd.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, I will revive the interest of those who absolutely do not want to crawl with screwdrivers and files into their beloved laptop or tablet, or, to their chagrin, did not find an empty mini-coaxial connector in them.  I present to your attention the poppen Wi-Fi USB dongle D-Link DWL-G122.  Removing the case, we see that even here the connector we needed (!) Was hidden.  True, it is slightly different from those with whom we dealt earlier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d9/833/699/2d9833699d3b9f515e36635060da4dfd.jpg"><br><br>  At the moment, only a lack of another burning Wi-Fi router separates me from its modification. <br>  Up.  only the road to the comrade is already separated, and by the way there was a burning D-Link. <br>  In this embodiment, of course, it is good that you do not have to pick an expensive laptop. <br>  As a conclusion, I hope that the possession of such an upgraded device will not force the owner to break all wireless networks that come to hand.  Good reception of Wi-Fi is useful in a peaceful life.  Those extra hundred or more meters that are missing from a public access point can provide the Internet in a place that is dear to your heart. <br><br>  Yours sincerely, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ne0/" class="user_link">nE0</a> . <br><br>  If you have any questions about the modification of a specific device, or need any other advice on the topic, you are welcome to the <a href="http://pasokon.ru/">pasokon.ru</a> forum, which is dedicated to UMPC and Tablet PC. <br>  Yo-ho-ho!  Sincere thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ognevsky/" class="user_link">ognevsky</a> for inviting my friend! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46483/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46483/</a></p>
