  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Features of creating a wholesale online clothing store / shoes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Creating a B2B-system for wholesale companies, we noticed a number of industry-specific features, without taking into account which to effectively use a B2B-system will not work.  One of the most capacious markets in e-commerce is the market of clothes and shoes, about the features of building a wholesale online store for this market and I will tell in this article, at the same time I will describe some of the principles of the wholesalers in this industry. <br><br><h5>  Principles of work of suppliers in the clothing and footwear market </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bde/85b/286/bde85b286465ae8ced94d13c06008a1a.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The supplier, as a rule, is a medium-large company with a number of employees of 20 people, and sometimes there is also its own network of retail stores.  He has a showroom to which his clients come.  Also, the distributor conducts trade activities at industry exhibitions.  In the showroom and at exhibitions, the wholesaler presents collections of goods for the next season, for example, wholesalers now collect pre-orders for spring.  Clients of such a supplier come to the showroom or to the exhibition (sometimes shows are held) select the models they are going to sell and pre-order these models.  Without going into further interaction, the supplier orders goods from factories and then provides goods to its customers.  During the season, customers do not take all the predicted goods into their warehouse, but choose them in batches, ordering additional goods. <br><br>  The supplier brings the goods not strictly on pre-order customers, but somewhat more.  In the season of shipments, the main tasks of the supplier are to ship the goods to the customers on time and sell the remaining goods.

      <br>
      In the season, when the goods arrive at the supplier‚Äôs warehouse, managers send EXCEL files every day to customers with one or several price lists, which indicate the availability of goods and prices.  Then they receive orders from customers, create invoices for them and make shipments. <br>  Creating a wholesale online store (B2B system) for companies selling shoes and clothing provides several advantages: <br><br><ul><li>  customers can order 24/7, regardless of the managers loading </li><li>  Customers can pre-order without arriving at the showroom and at the exhibition. </li><li>  Managers have fewer operational activities, since customers can independently find out about the availability of goods and issue bills. </li><li>  It is much more convenient for customers to pick up goods, respectively, the supplier has an additional opportunity to sell more goods. </li></ul><br><br>  The fundamental difference between a wholesale online store of clothing and footwear from other wholesale online stores is two things: <br><br><ul><li>  the need for high-quality images of goods </li><li>  the availability of the product characteristics such as color and size.  As a rule, it is for these characteristics that records are kept at the 1C level of the supplier. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/734/149/942/7341499420a6f511b9eebe41ca3b2ac6.png"><br><br>  The example shows that when choosing a blue shorts, the customer can see how many pieces of which size are in the supplier‚Äôs warehouse and can immediately make an order based on the most appropriate sizes.  By the way, pay attention to the <a href="http://photo.agorab2b.ru/AGORA/">quality of</a> photos, it is extremely important! <br>  It is also convenient to navigate in the general directory.  You can see in advance which product has how many colors and based on this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/054/b85/6ce/054b856ce5bf5eb5927b88fdc1815979.png"><br><br>  Of course, customers in the B2B system can see the entire list of orders made and status by them: <br><br>  In terms of displaying a list of orders, a B2B system is no different from a B2B system for other industries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6a/94f/899/c6a94f899c493f69bef24878dbc27412.png"><br><br>  The main condition for creating such <a href="http://centrobit.ru/produktyi-i-uslugi/products/b2b-commerce/">a</a> wholesale company <a href="http://centrobit.ru/produktyi-i-uslugi/products/b2b-commerce/">system</a> is the availability of data at the supplier‚Äôs 1C level.  There must be descriptions of goods, their images or links to images, plus, there must be order in the data on the availability of goods with a breakdown by characteristics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201712/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201712/</a></p>
