  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Does the border of class stratification pass through the subway?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Publicist Maxim Sokolov ( <a href="http://m-yu-sokolov.livejournal.com/">m-yu-sokolov</a> ) thought about the meaning of the ‚Äúpeople who ride the subway‚Äù traffic.  Reminding readers of the judgment among a certain part of Muscovites, according to which using the metro is a lot of losers and low-income people, <a href="http://m-yu-sokolov.livejournal.com/">m-yu-sokolov</a> suggests discussing whether subway passengers can actually be considered low social status holders. Account exist in other major cities in Russia and abroad. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚Äú <a href="http://m-yu-sokolov.livejournal.com/69140.html">With regard to Moscow, the turnover is quite meaningful</a> ,‚Äù notes <a href="http://m-yu-sokolov.livejournal.com/">m-yu-sokolov</a> , ‚Äú <a href="http://m-yu-sokolov.livejournal.com/69140.html">class stratification is very noticeable when descending into the underworld. It was really possible to say in French "people who ride the subway", but now it is still an anachronism, and underground merging of classes.</a> <a href="http://m-yu-sokolov.livejournal.com/69140.html"><br></a>  <a href="http://m-yu-sokolov.livejournal.com/69140.html">I wonder how this case is in other subways b.</a>  <a href="http://m-yu-sokolov.livejournal.com/69140.html">The USSR, as well as in the subways outside of France, Germany and Italy</a> . " <br><br>  Most commentators with the statement about the "class stratification" do not agree. <br><br><blockquote>  Wrong, in your subway :-) the same percentage of people from different groups (except for millionaires and individual taxi lovers), as in Moscow itself.  For example, I prefer the metro precisely for reasons of speed and safety (+ ecology), even when I arrive at MSC with a driver (I usually leave it near one of the outer stations). </blockquote>

    <blockquote>  Paul Khlebnikov was not a declassed man or a beggar.  But he drove exactly the subway. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Oh, and I saw Michael O'Leary the other day in the London Underground ‚Äî an uncle who controls Ryanair.  Billionaire, by the way. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  I ride the subway just because I work at the other end of the city along the green line.  With a very obvious affiliation to the middle class and the presence of a car. </blockquote><br><br>  As many readers rightly point out, if we take into account the legendary Moscow traffic jams and the aggressiveness of drivers, the metro is still an inexpensive and relatively convenient alternative to a private car or taxi. <br><br><blockquote>  you are making a mistake.  That people in the subway too much is yes.  But people go all sorts.  And the rich Pinocchio, too, what the witness himself.  And the reason, as elsewhere, is traffic jams.  For some, it is better to choke on the subway for half an hour than it is luxurious to sit in your car, but four hours, breathing exhaust.  :) </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  In the subway everything goes down, regardless of social affiliation, and even in ordinary life.  a couple of my acquaintances - let's say not poor people with personal cars - keep a travel card in the wallet on the subway (I didn‚Äôt check it).  because from China to Krasnopresnenskoy is better than metro.  or from Krasnopresnenskaya to Novoslobodskaya. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  According to my observations, in the morning rush hours, the middle class + students go all the way to the center towards the center.  (Gray line, south).  It is understandable.  A lot of this very class in recent years has bought an apartment in Butovo.  And how to go from Butov to the center or through the center?  By car in Warsaw?  Or according to the Trade Union?  Oh well. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  I have already changed 3 cars in Moscow, but I went to work-from-work for all 4 years, well, probably 20 times.  And for the most part at night, it is very pleasant to fly around the empty 3rd ring or center :).  And so I need a car in order to just go outside the metropolis on the weekends, get some air.  Or travel on vacation.  I am not ready to stand in traffic jams, agree with the ugly driving culture of Moscow, be late for meetings, etc.‚Ä¶ Therefore, I take the subway.  Here in Kiev, the flux density is 2 times smaller, there really is a reason to move on wheels.  And a completely different mentality among drivers is to let pedestrians pass, do not run along the lanes without need, do not fart persistently, turn on turn signals, do not blink special signals, etc., in short, if possible, not be rude. </blockquote><br><br>  According to the observations of bloggers, the degree of ‚Äúrespectability‚Äù of public transport in general and the metro in particular in other cities and countries differs greatly depending on the specific mode of transport and the organization of the urban economy. <br><br><blockquote>  In the St. Petersburg metro, women-children-old-students predominate over men who ‚Äúhave a car‚Äù. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  We have [Nizhny Novgorod.  - Approx.  Ed.] subway small, 2 branches, 13 stations.  Ride him very little, because uncomfortable.  We rather use the term ‚Äúpeople traveling in minibuses‚Äù - this is where the cloaca is, the broken-downs are broken down, the fans like Radio Chanson are all like-minded and dirty.  For example, I try not to go into these minibuses, only if absolutely necessary. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  New York's elite live in Manhattan.  And from there almost never leaves - see the series "Sex and the City" for an illustration, but I myself know many manhattanites.  The question is: how will a Manhattan resident go between the apartment in Greenwich Village and the office in Midtown?  The answer is by taxi.  In the New York subway, poor students and oppressed minorities are worse than in Moscow.  Knife saw, waved repeatedly (although I do not live in New York, I am on short visits).  Other cities in America are usually arranged differently: There is an elite quarter in the center (for example, Boston Back Bay and West End - from there they travel to offices by taxi - it's good not far. But most of them live in saburbahs and ride electric trains (not to stand in traffic). so the train is a pretty decent audience. From the station again, people spread to taxis or take the subway with a maximum of several stops in the center. Whether there is a decent audience in the subway depends greatly on whether the subway goes to rich saburbs. [...] </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Subway [In Washington.  - Approx.  Ed.] - very expensive and very clean.  Metro - transport officials traveling from the suburbs to DC and back.  There is, however, one dangerous line - krsnaya: to the north it goes to the black quarters.  To the south - already peace and quiet and God's blessing.  Especially from Central Station and further south.  How they cut off socially dangerous elements - I won‚Äôt attach my mind;  agree, apparently.  But they do not reach the center.  In general, the analogue of the metro in Washington is the bus: it is the transport of the poor, black and dangerous.  In the bus can and show a knife. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Paris metro compared with the Moscow and St. Petersburg shny looks fair cloaca, the abode of clochards and "vulnerable minorities."  So it seemed ten years ago and at the height of the working day. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  In Rome, especially in the evening, most of the subway are tourists and expatriates.  However, the same can be said about all types of public transport. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  In Switzerland, there is no decent LM Kaganovich in order to create a wide metro network, but on the trains there are very decent working people (for example, I widely practiced).  Actually, to move to the Italian (best) part of the country from the north is the best option if you go one day. It is very convenient: it is noted on the platforms in advance where the car of which class will arrive, not to mention well-calculated transfers, a lot of information with timetables, and a subscription generally cheap.  Again, the aesthetic component: the views from the train window are more fun than from the car traveling in the bath, especially when the train is panoramic.  [...] And in Moscow a car, pmsm, is not needed at all, especially if you live and work near the metro.  And if it is needed, it is cheaper to take a taxi or hire, so the Moscow metro does not carry a class character: take a look at the users' fur coats. </blockquote><br><br><h2>  Do you take the subway or by car? </h2></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15815/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15815/</a></p>
