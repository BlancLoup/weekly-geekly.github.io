      Yes, Google is constantly changing.  And yes, changes affect your traffic. <br>  However, the biggest SEO trends do not affect your place in the issue. <br>  They affect your CTR. <br><br>  And this is a big difference. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Traveling with me in the past ... </h3><br>  Five years ago, a typical search results page looked completely different.  I have an archive of old screenshots, so it will be fun.  Just by looking at them, you can identify obvious SEO trends. <br><br>  If in 2014 you were searching for ‚Äúlead generation websites‚Äù, then that‚Äôs what you found. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h7/qj/zi/h7qjzimce1osmfthqp7w1yuflq8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Feel nostalgic?  Old google logo. <br>  But how else are these pages different? <br><br><h4>  1. Ads are more visible </h4><br>  The little icon next to each ad was bright yellow.  There was even a line that separated the advertising from the organic issue.  And all these ads were in the right column. <br><br><h4>  2. The organic top is about 450 pixels below. </h4><br>  Assuming that the average fold for the desktop is 700 pixels, the top 3 ads in organic output are visible without scrolling. <br><br><h4>  3. I am issuing the fourth </h4><br>  800 pixels down the page.  We will come back to this. <br><br>  Now let's look at the same search today, in 2019. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xw/ns/lb/xwnslbssl41-olzenmxh_d9t_rg.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Huge changes.  And they highlight the main SEO trends: <br><br><h4>  1. Less ads </h4><br>  Here you see four ads, not 12. That's less, right? <br>  Not really, if you count the links under the ads, they are 11. <br>  Thus, the number of links to advertisers is still large. <br>  And the ad icon is much less noticeable.  He merges. <br>  Ads have become like organic issue. <br><br><h4>  2. Seller rating </h4><br>  One of the advertisers has stars. <br><br><h4>  3. Giant snippet </h4><br>  It is large and is in the top of the issue and combines text from one page and image <br>  with another.  The user can get all the necessary information without going <br>  on the ad. <br><br><h4>  4. Block related questions </h4><br>  The ‚ÄúPeople are also looking for‚Äù search carousel gives the user more opportunities to interact and get information without leaving the SERP.  And it pushes down SEO. <br><br><h4>  5. The organic top is at 2600 pixels below. </h4><br>  Below the first scroll screen. <br><br><h4>  6. I am issuing the sixth </h4><br>  This is two places lower.  Not a big difference.  But the actual situation? <br>  3000+ pixels down the page. <br><br>  Place in the issuance has changed slightly (from # 4 to # 6), but the situation has changed significantly.  800 pixels depth versus 3900 pixels depth <br><br><h3>  Position in search results is durable.  Position - no </h3><br>  Surprised by how little SEO has changed in five years?  Me not! <br><br>  In my experience, pages that are well ranked tend to continue to rank well over a long period of time. <br><br>  After five years, our page still holds a good position. <br><br>  What influences the situation in SEO-issue? <br><br>  Changes in the ranking algorithm are real, but much larger SEO trends are ‚Äúissue elements,‚Äù such as snippets, maps, and videos. <br><br>  Here is a list of the elements of the issue that you see in the search results every day. <br><br>  You can see when they first appeared and the likelihood that they will appear in 2019, according to <a href="https://moz.com/mozcast/features">MozCast.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vr/qt/ge/vrqtgesv_27yqm_9y4eeedijtsu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Note: Mozcast is constantly updated.</i>  <i>The chart reflects percentages at the time of writing.</i> <br><br>  Here is another example, before and after, 2015 and 2019: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yc/l_/gs/ycl_gsjiz-n02zp8zxo1nqoayvk.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Top rated pages are not ranked as high as before.  They are below the issue elements.  In this case, it is advertising, snippets and a block of related issues. <br><br>  Here is another one: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pr/v9/sw/prv9sw_-zirws6emd3l3arz1gx8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's take another one: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xp/n-/go/xpn-gohaucbyk1r5xnos3oixtcu.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This is fun, because back in 2013, advertising still had a colorful background, clearly highlighting them. <br><br>  This was also the end of the era of Google authorship, when Google showed the faces of content creators in search results.  This program was canceled, presumably because <br>  that it increased the clicks on the websites and reduced the clicks on the ads. <br><br><h3>  What does this mean for traffic? </h3><br><br>  Over the years, more and more users find answers immediately in the issue, using various elements of the issue.  Because of this, sites began to receive less traffic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/rs/ym/dsrsymlgfzzvcxeh_qwq9qqsjqa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  61% of mobile search and 33% of the desktop does not lead to a click. <br>  This is 5.6 billion Google searches per day. <br>  Approximately 250 million fewer visits to websites every day. <br><br>  So this is a mega trend in SEO: <br>  <b>more answers in search results and less clicks on the ad.</b> <br><br>  Even if your position in the issuance does not change, over time you will notice a drop in CTR. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fp/b7/sy/fpb7synwm3dlxzlvwgkdc3vyrjw.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But there are examples, as with the growth of the position in the issuance, the traffic became even smaller. <br>  This makes life difficult for SEO agencies. <br>  ‚ÄúYes, I know that traffic has dropped, but the position in the issue has grown.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  What to do with the growth of search elements and the fall in CTR? </h3><br>  Do not despair.  Google is still an excellent and inexpensive source of quality traffic for most websites. <br><br>  But as Google changes, so must we. <br><br>  To keep traffic flowing, I recommend the following tips and methods: <br><br><ul><li>  Target phrases with fewer search results. <br>  Often these are longer, non-commercial phrases. </li><li>  Fight for extended snippets.  (Here is the <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/find-featured-snippets/">guide</a> ) </li><li>  Use semantics correctly.  (here is the <a href="https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/semantic-seo/">guide</a> ) </li><li>  Increase your email base. <br>  The larger your base, the less you rely on digital giants. </li><li>  Write for other sites.  This does not increase your traffic, but publishing on reputable websites can do wonders for the visibility of your content. </li><li>  Increase the amount of content targeted to key phrases. <br>  There are millions more options for key phrases </li></ul><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI would also think about how to keep a visitor to your site. <br>  Think about the user's path.  What does he want to know after searching for a specific query?  Include it in your content!  Thus, you will reduce the% of failures, and the user will find what he needs. ‚ÄùDan Shure </blockquote><h3>  More SEO trends </h3><br>  Here are some more basic SEO trends, starting with the main one, about which we only <br>  what they said. <br><br>  1. The increase in search results items, including snippets and a block of related issues, leads to a decrease in CTR and traffic to the site. <br><br>  2. Increase the share of voice search. <br>  According to a BrightLocal survey, 58% of consumers <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/learn/voice-search-for-local-business-study/">used</a> voice search last year <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/learn/voice-search-for-local-business-study/">to</a> search for local businesses. <br><br>  3. Increase mobile search. <br>  According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/275814/mobile-share-of-organic-search-engine-visits/">Statista</a> , 60% of Google‚Äôs search queries come from mobile devices.  5 years ago he was at the level of 34%. <br>  In five years, it has almost doubled. <br><br><h3>  ‚ÄúI need to hire someone to support my SEO ...‚Äù </h3><br>  We often hear it. <br><br>  I answer with the simple question ‚Äúwhat kind of SEO support do you mean?‚Äù <br><br>  Usually, after a short silence, they explain that they want to maintain their position in the issuance of several specific phrases. <br><br>  Just think about it! <br><br>  There are things much more important than the place in the issuance. <br><br>  Subscribe to my <a href="https://t.me/proroas">telegram channel</a> (@proroas), writing about digital marketing, services and analytics.
