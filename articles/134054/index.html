The story is still far from complete - perhaps, we now have the most difficult and dramatic period: we already know what does not work, and it‚Äôs pretty clear which way we should move, but there‚Äôs not much time to make decisions, since the first ones "Our investment is coming to an end.  I think this story is quite typical for a startup. <br><br>  Get ready - the story will be long, but I will try to make it interesting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Introduction </h3><br>  9facts is a service that allows users to compare virtually any achievements among various groups of people (friends, residents of a city or country, university students, etc.).

The service continuously updates achievement ratings for any cities, regions, countries, groups of people (for example, your university, employees of your company or a group of your friends) and keywords. <br><br>  Achievements (or rather, the facts) can be obtained from third-party services automatically, as well as add them manually.  We have not yet opened an API that allows any sites and devices to send facts to 9facts, but we have built-in support for the most popular services (Facebook, Twitter, Stack Overflow, LinkedIn, RescueTime, etc.). <br><br>  In addition, they will soon earn money on the service [removed the spoiler, since the whole section ‚ÄúPivot‚Äù is devoted to this topic - perhaps this is its most interesting feature. <br><br><h3>  Idea </h3><br>  The 9facts idea arose in April of this year - almost immediately after the end of <a href="http://russia.startupweekend.org/2011/04/11/%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-startup-weekend/">Startup Weekend Ekaterinburg</a> , where I presented my other idea - the <a href="https://docs.google.com/leaf%3Fid%3D0B8afl34_Ump-Y2Q5ZDVjMGQtYzQyMC00MTEyLWJlZDgtNDU1YTk0YWQ5YmUy%26amp%3Bhl%3Den">Agile-fu</a> project.  Agile-fu was <a href="http://startupspaces.org/%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC-sw-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BF/">one of the winners of the</a> weekend - IMO, it was the most developed project, among others.  As a result, I received an investment proposal from <a href="http://moreynis.moikrug.ru/">Arkady Moreynis</a> , although it still seemed to me that this idea could be somewhat improved - I really wanted to turn the service into something really massive.  Perhaps, because on Sunday, April 10, we, marking this small victory in the company with a couple of classmates, came to the conclusion that Agile-fu is a completely niche service. <br><br>  On Monday, having broken my head a little, I came to understand that the key Agile-fu ‚Äútrick‚Äù is not at all in that it collects data to evaluate the effectiveness, but in the fact that it can show the results of evaluations in the same way as people would like to see them - i.e.  show ratings to users by several independent parameters related to their effectiveness.  It became clear that the emphasis should be placed on this - people like to compare themselves with others, show off achievements, etc.  Moreover, it is also interesting for companies - having a universal tool for comparing their employees, they could use it as a means for competitive motivation. <br><br>  So, it is interesting to compare not a specific set of indicators, but arbitrary achievements of people.  It was April 11th - the very next day after the end of Startup Weekend.  I remembered well that after such an ‚Äúinsight‚Äù I literally immediately called a friend with whom we were discussing the service on Sunday, and spoke about the new idea.  He liked everything (and he is a good critic) - so I received the first confirmation that the service for mass comparison of people on a completely arbitrary set of metrics is not as crazy an idea as it may seem at first glance. <br><br><h3>  Investor search </h3><br>  The most serious moment has come: the search for the first investor.  My own company at that time already financed one internal project, so we practically did not have the money for a good launch.  I also did not want to work on a prototype for a long time: the competition in the modern world is incredibly high.  But the main reason was still the fact that investors, as a rule, can give a more sober assessment of what is intended, and their cash money is the most important indicator of what the project should be taken. <br><br>  On the same day, I sent a presentation of the new project (it was clear that this was not Agile-fu at all) to Leonid Volkov. <br><br>  A logical question: "why not Arcadia Moreinis?"  - the answer to it is complex, but on the whole it is this: I communicated with Leonid much longer, and believed (as it turned out correctly) that we had a trusting relationship, and therefore I can calmly send him a description without fear that it will go to third parties, even if we can not agree.  I could also say only good things about Arcadia - no doubt, his reputation as an investor is much higher.  But since we communicated significantly less, Arkady lost Leonid in terms of mutual trust.  Probably, I was slightly scared away by ‚Äúthe idea is not worth anything‚Äù (in this he, by the way, is 99.99% right) and ‚Äúwhy should I not finance another team for the same money that comes to me with the same idea?‚Äù.  In addition, I knew about the parameters of Arkady's transactions, and I really didn‚Äôt want to give a significant share of the project at the very first step - <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/6949/forming-a-new-software-startup-how-do-i-allocate-ownership-fairly/23326">I don‚Äôt think that this is very good</a> .  On the other hand, for startups in Russia, its conditions are completely adequate. <br><br>  Leonid <a href="http://leonwolf.livejournal.com/2011/03/21/">was in the USA</a> at that time, but he answered on the same day ‚Äî he liked the idea immediately.  I liked both the scope (the whole world, and not only Russia), and the novelty - by the way, at that time I still didn‚Äôt really know if there was anything like that.  There was almost complete certainty that no (‚Äúotherwise we would use it!‚Äù), But seriously I haven‚Äôt checked it yet.  In the first letter I asked a direct question to Leonid: is he ready to invest in such a project?  He replied that he was ready to discuss this as soon as he returned to Yekaterinburg, which was a very positive signal that the idea should be worked out to the end - in simple terms, to describe everything in detail, and even better to make a prototype UI (I use free online for this <a href="http://balsamiq.com/">version of Balsamiq</a> ) and write the most important user stories. <br><br>  The key problem at the time sounded like this: how to describe the most diverse achievements?  I needed something simple to do that.  Soon a concept was born that is very similar to the one that is now being implemented in 9facts: an achievement description is a template that is filled with parameters (mostly with terms from a large taxonomy) and contains a metric that allows you to compare achievements that are parameterized in the same way.  Later it turned out that the idea with keywords is also good in that it allows us to select the templates qualitatively in the text of the fact, and moreover, to identify the whole categories to which the fact relates.  Knowing that a specific parameter of a template is a car brand, we can confidently say that it will not be suitable for describing a fact in the text of which a car brand does not appear.  The same applies to measures - a pattern implying the existence of a measure "speed" is not suitable for describing a fact in which it is long. <br><br>  "And the service should have a very simple API that allows anyone to" fill in "almost arbitrary facts about people."  - it opened up quite fantastic possibilities. <br><br>  So, the 9facts outlines crystallized gradually.  Then I rummaged through the entire Internet in search of something similar to what I had invented.  Nothing like this could not be found.  All that is is niche services that solve a similar problem for one or two types of facts.  In addition, it turned out that no one is building ‚Äúlocal‚Äù ratings - there are practically none on the web.  There are global ratings (a typical example is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users%3Ftab%3Dreputation%26amp%3Bfilter%3Dall">the Stack Overflow user rating</a> ), but it‚Äôs clear that people would be interested to know their place in a similar rating by country, city, school or university. <br><br>  Leonid left a preliminary description of this concept.  I will quote his answer in full: <br><blockquote>  The autowashing of positive facts about a person is a mega-idea.  I really like that such a simple concept crystallized in the end.  In the end, the practical any human activity is reflected in the form of facts that can be collected in one or another established format. "Has two dogs."  "Flew over the year more than 100 thousand miles."  "Published 10 articles."  "Very much appreciated by colleagues."  And I agree that many of these facts about the modern "electronic" person can already be collected and confirmed automatically. <br></blockquote>  Another day of active correspondence and communication via Skype passed, and I received a clear investment offer from Leonid.  There was no personal meeting - however, we met and communicated before, so in fact it was not very important.  But anyway, it was awesome - the idea (April 11), two days, and - ta-da!  - I offer real money for its implementation (April 13)! <br><br>  Further events began to develop rapidly: we negotiated with Leonid on investment conditions, at the same time I <a href="http://ru.alexyakunin.com/2011/05/blog-post.html">began to look for investors for a project in the USA</a> (obviously, conditions can be improved only when there is competition among investors).  It turned out that with investors in the United States everything is somewhat more complicated than it seemed to me at the very beginning: on the one hand, I received some indirect evidence that the chances of finding money there are very high.  On the other hand, in order to get them there, you have to be there.  And not just to be, but to do a project in the USA - otherwise they will not talk to us.  It became clear that this would delay the start of work for at least 2-3 months. <br><br>  The situation was a stalemate: on the one hand, I wanted to do everything as quickly as possible (I wrote above why);  on the other hand, I wanted to improve the investment conditions, but for this I had to sacrifice speed.  It seemed to have to choose one of two things. <br><br>  Fortunately, everything was resolved very well: both I and Leonid went to mutual concessions - as a result <a href="http://ru.alexyakunin.com/2011/06/9facts-it-eburgcom.html">we received more expensive, but also more ‚Äúquick‚Äù money</a> . <br><br>  It should be said that monetization didn‚Äôt really worry me or Leonid at that moment - it was clear that the service that stores key facts about people can be monetized in a variety of ways, and the market will be large enough in any of the options.  In the presentations, I gave at least 5 options for monetization, but we did not seriously discuss any of them. <br><br><h3>  Prototype </h3><br>  In May, I was engaged in three major tasks: <br><ul><li>  presentation materials and negotiations with potential investors </li><li>  project development - at the end of April <a href="http://9facts.com/User/Display/2%3Fname%3Dshtin">Alexey Shtin</a> joined the project.  He also presented his project at Startup Weekend, and in the same place offered to participate in the creation of Agile-fu, if it is financed by Arkady.  We began correspondence with him on April 9, and on April 20, we finally agreed on everything. </li><li>  search for employees. </li></ul>  The second investor was my own company.  More precisely, based by me - at that time I was one of its 3 co-founders.  Thus, in total, we "raised" $ 70K: <br><ul><li>  $ 40K from Leonid Volkov </li><li>  $ 30K from X-tensive.com. </li></ul>  The original plan was: <br><ul><li>  09.09.2011 we are launching a prototype.  The date was clearly associated with the name of the project, but it is clear that no serious planning was planned for this date.  Nevertheless, she was good both in terms of motivation and in terms of intimacy (~ 3 months). </li><li>  I am going to the United States to look for the following investors - it was thought that there would be plenty of people willing to give us money, as we are doing a completely new and unique service. </li><li>  In December, we finally agree with the next investor, and make the project further, sending part of the team to the United States. </li></ul>  It should immediately say that everything went completely wrong.  Details - later, but for now about how we rather quickly put together a good team: <br><ul><li>  At the end of May, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrimaximov">Dima Maximov</a> joined us - up to this point he was responsible for promoting DataObjects.Net to X-tensive.com, and in the past was one of the first developers (probably even the first) of the Internet Bank Bank24.ru.  Thus, an employee of my own company became the third person in the project. </li><li>  In June, Alexey Katkov, Marat Faskhiev (also Extensive employee) and <a href="http://9facts.com/u/psulek/7">Peter ≈†ulek from</a> Slovakia appeared in the team - he liked the project very much;  In addition, he is one of the most advanced users of DataObjects.Net - in the past he has made a visual designer for him. </li><li>  In July, my brother Sergey started working on the project - he was responsible for everything related to design.  By the way, at the same time, it was decided that we cannot spend a lot of resources on design (since money is relatively small so far), and therefore it is better to immediately take something known as a model and largely rely on it.  As a result, Twitter has become a model for us.  In addition, we were joined by Yevgeny Ganin. </li></ul>  Not all of these people worked on the project full time.  However, key people worked practically around the clock, so I think, on average, 7-8 full-time developers actually worked on the project. <br><br>  It would seem that 8 people are a big enough team to do everything very quickly.  However, things didn‚Äôt go as smoothly as we would like: at the end of August (about 3 months after I started participating in the development at 100%), we had something that very vaguely resembled modern 9facts: <br><ul><li>  There was an input of the facts.  However, the template matching algorithm was such that it provided more or less adequate matches for only 10 of the 70 existing templates. </li><li>  There were users, friends, fact sheets and settings.  Everything. </li></ul>  There were no ratings, no groups, no likes, no confirmations - in fact, there was nothing that made it clear why this thing was needed at all.  Oh, yes - since there were a lot of us, the work was often parallelized, and therefore there were unfinished parts in the application - access to them was simply blocked at the time of release. <br><br>  Approximately 2 weeks before 09.09, we stopped making new features, switching only to testing and fixing problems.  On the ninth of September it became clear that all of them could not be fixed in the remaining hours.  As a result, we posted everything "as is", and the project's blog has the first record that the release took place on the planned date.  The time of publication of this record is two minutes 2 minutes 10 September.  I joked that it was good that Yekaterinburg time. <br><br>  The next two days (ie, the whole weekend) we fixed the remaining problems.  The 9facts prototype, which did not fall out of the blue, was born closer to September 12th. <br><br><h3>  Start-up Rocket and presentation to Steve Blanca </h3><br>  I learned about the Start-up Rocket in August - it was clear that we really need to get on it.  And moreover, we have all the chances for this: <br><ul><li>  We are doing a global project that has no analogues </li><li>  By the time of the competition we will have a prototype, i.e.  we satisfy all the conditions of the competition. </li></ul>  I applied for participation at the end of August - then we didn‚Äôt have a prototype yet.  But nevertheless, by the time the commission began to select projects, it had appeared.  In addition, for some reason, there was a delay on the side of the commission with the actual selection process - it was completed only on Monday, September 12.  Late that night, I received a call from a person from StartupPoint who told me that we were selected with 9facts.  Later, I learned that we passed precisely because of the guys from <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/">StartupPoint</a> ‚Äî they liked both the scale and the idea itself, and as a result they somehow defended us in front of colleagues. <br><br>  The next day I flew to Moscow.  On Thursday, there was a trial presentation of the project at the PwC office - it seemed to me that everything went smoothly there.  Later, I realized that everything was completely wrong - the fact is that I was not able to convey the essence of what we are doing in the allotted 5 minutes (real time for the presentation), but it turned out very well to do it in the next 25 minutes of conversation with PwC representatives.  By the way, the trial presentation was in English, but I‚Äôm writing ‚Äúnot bad, but I‚Äôm noticeably worse,‚Äù somehow got out.  I remember that there were no serious interferences when communicating. <br><br>  On the day of the presentation, I was terribly nervous, although I rehearsed my speech for more than 6 hours, making more than 60 repetitions.  In addition, I spoke first, i.e.  I did not know what questions I should wait for, and how everything will be, to be honest. <br><br>  In 5 minutes I told everything I had planned - not too smoothly, but everything seemed to be quite acceptable.  Steve was listening, writing something, and occasionally looking up at the screen - it was clear that for the most part he was busy with something of his own.  Nevertheless, at the end of the presentation, he reduced all my efforts to nothing with just two questions: <br>  - <i>Do you already have users?</i>  - a five-second pause, and I say: <br>  - No, we don't have them yet. <br><br>  In fact, at that moment we had about 150 users, and I had to say this, since not all the participants could even boast of it.  However, we didn‚Äôt draw conclusions from what these users do (as I understood later, the next question could be about that), so even if I said yes, the next question would have put me anyway to a dead end. <br><br>  Steve's second question was: <br>  - <i>Do you know <a href="http://klout.com/">Klout</a> service?</i>  <i>It seems to me that what you are doing is very similar to this project.</i> <br>  - No, I hear about him for the first time. <br><br>  I really could not answer this question better, because I did not know what was going on.  No more questions were asked - the public had an opinion that we were doing a clone of some famous project that Steve knows about, and the interest was gone. <br><br>  I immediately sat down to find out what Klout is and how could I not know about the competitor.  I found out that Klout has nothing to do with us - this is a service that tries to evaluate your network impact by the way users react to the messages you post, and this rating is more informative than, for example, the number of your followers on Twitter, because many can follow you, but very few of you are really interesting.  It is clear that this is not 9facts, although there is something in common with us.  Probably, only that we also collect from met-networks different metrics that characterize you, and compare them.  However, we do this for each of the metrics individually, and moreover, we are not at all limited to social networks - with the same success we can compare your reputation at Stack Overflow, your height, weight, or the amount of alcohol you have drunk today. <br><br>  Why did Steve decide we were like Klout?  Probably because the slide about which external services we already support was one of the most striking, or because during his discussion I said a lot of keywords that settled in Steve‚Äôs head.  Or maybe he just listened to me only at the moment of the slide show - to say that it was actually difficult, but one thing was clear: I did not manage to convey the essence of what we are doing, neither to Steve, nor to the audience. <br><br>  It was an epic file that had to be corrected somehow.  I approached Steve one of the first ones already at the reception after the event, and directly asked him if he would be ready to present us to investors in the US if he would like our project in the next 5 minutes.  Steve asked: ‚ÄúOk, what is your startup?‚Äù, And I told everything in my own words, at the same time touching on the topic of Klout.  It turned out that it was much easier to talk with him personally - he listened very carefully, considered what he heard and asked very specific questions.  Now it‚Äôs hard to remember everything, but the key questions were: <br>  ‚ÄúWhy do you think that someone needs this?‚Äù <br>  - Give an example of your target audience? <br>  - Another example? <br>  - How do you plan to market the product? <br><br>  Finally, Steve asked: <br>  - Ok, how much money you raise?  - I began to frantically think how to say $ 350K in English, but in the end I hurried and said: <br>  - $ 40K <br>  - Really? <br>  - Oh, sorry, $ 400K <br>  - Ok, how much is this in Rubles? <br>  - About 10 millions - I thought then clearly not very <br>  - I just want to calculate this :) <br><br>  After a couple more minutes of conversation, Steve suggested recording his e-mail.  In addition, he said that he was ready to help us with the introductions and talked about when and where he would be in the United States soon, and also said that he does not mind meeting again - apparently, in response to my reply to that I plan to visit the United States in the coming month. <br><br>  It is clear that I was beside myself with delight - "Steve Blank promised to help us intro in the USA!"  - then I thought that the next round of investing was sooo close.  As it turned out, in vain - read about it further. <br><br>  Presentations of all participants of the Start-up Rocket can be viewed <a href="http://www.steveblank.ru/2011/10/03/prezentatsii-uchastnikov-start-up-rocket-proverka-gotovnosti-startapov-k-vyhodu-na-mezhdunarodnyy-rynok">here</a> (it seems that only SpeakToIt presentations are missing). <br><br><h3>  Alpha release, first problems </h3><br>  Our further actions I saw something like this: <br><ul><li>  In early October, release an alpha version - with ratings, groups, etc. </li><li>  Write about this to the maximum number of investors known to us. </li><li>  Start a campaign to attract the most important to us user categories </li><li>  Wait for interesting offers, watching how quickly our user base is growing. </li></ul>  However, the first trouble happened where we did not expect it at all: on September 23, Facebook announced the Open Graph API.  It became clear that everything that we did in terms of fixing the facts of users (or activities in terms of Facebook), lost its uniqueness, since Facebook would make all this mass much earlier.  And accordingly, we will have to change both our far-reaching plans and presentation materials for investors. <br><br>  We decided that it makes sense to focus on: <br><ul><li>  ‚Äî  Open Graph    Facebook   ,      . </li><li>       ‚Äî  ,   ,         Facebook.  , ,        . </li></ul><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The development of all this took much more time than planned - we released an update on November 10, although we planned to do it on October 10. It was very unpleasant - a large enough team worked on the project, and every month it cost us about $ 13K. The means at our disposal came to an end. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As soon as we did, I wrote to Steve Blanca, and also asked him to be my friend on Facebook and LinkedIn. He answered only the third message - at that time he was giving lectures in New York, and, judging by the context, he could not answer right away. However, all he promised was to read our Executive Summary and send it further if he finds it interesting.</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in fact, nothing concrete - I quickly realized that his answer meant roughly the same thing as the famous "Don't call us, you call you". After that, I didn‚Äôt write to him, although I think I‚Äôll write again after we have an obvious traction. I have a 100% feeling that traction, as a result of analysis and adaptation to the actions of users, is exactly what it is waiting for. He writes, speaks about it, and this is exactly what many other investors are waiting for.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ok, back to the service. The most important and unpleasant indicator for us was that a week after the launch of alpha we didn‚Äôt have any significant user growth, and moreover, there was a feeling that even if we chased a lot of users there, the service would cease to be for each of them interesting quickly enough: ok, several times they will share their mega ratings in social networks, they will call several friends, and what's next is not clear. From the providers of facts, for which it makes sense to observe constantly, we only had RescueTime; It‚Äôs not very interesting to watch your and other people's reputation on Stack Overflow, since significant changes happen rarely there.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, it was clear that these problems simply would not exist if we had many users and applications that support our API (which hasn‚Äôt been there yet). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was a feeling that we were faced with the classic problem of chicken and eggs. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, there were almost no viral features at the time of launching alpha - they are not there even at the time of this writing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It would seem that one could just start adding them, evaluate the result, and move on, slightly adjusting the direction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not a bad option, given that we had a whole list of what should be implemented in this part:</font></font><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Opportunity to fumble their achievements (see positions in ratings by city, country, etc.) in social networks - now we are doing it </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Restrictions on the minimum size of the group, the achievements within which can be fumbled </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Integration with social networks in the part of invitations and contacts </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Questions about friends in social networks by analogy with Badoo </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> An API that allows you to create facts for unregistered users - to create such a fact, it is enough to specify the user's e-mail. </font></font></li></ul><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, most of all I liked the other version of the development of the service, significantly changing its concept. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I will tell about it in the "Pivot" section - first I want to tell you about my experience of participating in StartPoint.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> StartPoint </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I participated in two Startpoints - the </font></font><a href="http://startuppoint.ru/blog/public/36051.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">30th point in Moscow</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="http://startuppoint.ru/events/32768/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the 4th point in Yekaterinburg</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , making two-minute presentations of 9facts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The conclusions in both cases are about the same:</font></font><br><ul><li> <b>       30-60 .</b>    ,          ‚Äî   .  ,        ‚Äî      9facts,   ,         ,         : "9facts ‚Äî     ". </li><li> <b>       ,        .</b>  , ,   ‚Äî      .   ‚Äî     , IT people    ‚Äî ,      ,       .  ,           (..    ,     ),       ..        ,     100%  ‚Äî ,       " " ( ,        ,      5)  "" (      ,     ,    ). </li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a rule, there are few real investors at the points - that is, those who came there with the aim of finding a project in which to invest money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">there are plenty of people who are ready to give a very sober assessment and criticism, and this is extremely positive.</font></font></b> </li></ul><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I think the following rule for assessing the quality of your presentation is applicable: </font></font><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> maximum votes ‚Üí excellent </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> maximum votes / 3 ‚Üí medium </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> maximum votes / 9 ‚Üí this is a failure. </font></font></li></ul><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Summary: I highly recommend that you try to tell about your project at one of the points. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If they understand you (i.e., you get more than a third of the maximum votes cast by someone), then the investor will probably understand you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If not, you need to change something. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those presenters who scored the minimum, as a rule, made completely gross mistakes.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Pivot, or a radical change in the concept of service </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of November, I had a good idea about which direction we should go. An internal dialogue led to its appearance: </font></font><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What is our biggest problem now? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No users. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Is our service useful for users now? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, although it cannot be said that it is obvious to every user immediately. In addition, it is not obvious how useful it is to the user in the long term. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Why is its usefulness not immediately apparent? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- All he gives you now is local ratings plus one more confirmation of your high results (at best). Our service also collects many results in one place. Someone is interested, of course, but it is clear that not everyone is interested in this.</font></font><br> ‚Äî ,               ? <br> ‚Äî ,  .          Klout.         ,    .  ‚Äî  ,    - ,       . <br> ‚Äî ,             ? <br> ‚Äî .</i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, what can significantly increase the value of the service in the eyes of new users? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Obviously a direct benefit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More precisely, it is obvious when you already have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow exactly you can interest all parties in the implementation of the plan, which will also lead to the emergence of a direct benefit for the users themselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it is not at all obvious when you do not know exactly how to achieve this. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here is the updated 9facts concept:</font></font><br><ul><li> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"9 facts" is Groupon, which allows you to make a marketing campaign for a specific category of users interesting for you. </font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, you can give a significant discount on your software to only 10% of developers who have a top reputation for Stack Overflow in your city. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or in any city in a country, in a particular state, in certain countries, and so on.</font></font></li><li>        <b>   ,        </b> . </li><li>  ,   <b>            </b> . ,  0.1%  Twitter       (100% ),  10% ‚Äî    50%,   20%    ‚Äî  30%- .           . </li><li> <b>,        ‚Äî    ,     10%.      ,   .</b>   0.1%, ,        .    ,    ,    ,        . </li><li> <b>           ,      </b> : ,    ,     ,          . </li><li> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We do not plan to hold contests that require you to perform a specific set of actions. </font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our goal is to enable suppliers of goods and services to reach top users among their target audience, that is, those who already have proven achievements or facts.</font></font></li></ul> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bed/350/50c/bed35050c40b7fea0af19d864864705d.jpg"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Show the layout of the next version of 9facts entirely.</font></font></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Such an approach to the promotion and positioning of the service is also good because the steps to implement it are completely transparent:</font></font><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> It is necessary to immediately engage in negotiations with companies that would be interested in such a marketing channel. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> At the same time, we need to quickly implement the missing functionality (see the distribution of discounts and prizes to top users of the service). </font></font></li></ul><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this situation, I was most struck by how strongly the question of promoting the service is related to the question of monetization: until a certain moment we thought that monetization was completely unimportant for us in the next year or two - it‚Äôs just how many new users we can attract . And suddenly we realized that the number of users that we can attract is directly related to how much money those same users can save thanks to us! The more famous sellers and brands we attract, and the more interesting discounts and gifts they can offer, the more we will have users. No magic</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, for some time the service will be free for sellers and manufacturers of goods, but for us it practically does not change anything: the value of 9facts is determined solely by its audience and turnover. By the way, at that moment it became clear to us what the peak cost of such a service could be - we can probably count on 5-10% of the cost of Groupon if we do everything really quickly and efficiently. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I could not help but pay attention to the following fact: judging by the reports of Startup Genome, each startup, on average, 1 time significantly changes its concept. It was quite obvious that now was the moment for us - we had to change in order to turn into what users want to see. And I really hoped that we correctly guessed the direction of our transformation.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With these positive thoughts, I went to bed on Monday, November 28th. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep that evening - His Majesty Chance turned all my plans over.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> All-Russian Innovation Convention - Dave McClure, Garry Tan (YC), Harj Tagger (YC), Peter Vesterbacka (Angry Birds) and other interesting people </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before going to bed, I decided to take a look at Facebook, where I found </font></font><a href="http://www.facebook.com/vitakimov/posts/2809913606149"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">this offer by Vitaly Akimov</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . It's funny that I usually do not follow Facebook continuously - I look there once or twice a day. But it turned out that I read Vitaly's message at the same moment when it was published, and almost immediately sent him an answer, in which he briefly described our new marketing strategy and my desire to participate in the convention. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that moment I had no idea what exactly I would need to do there, how the event would take place and whether I would even have the opportunity to make a presentation. But the </font></font><a href="http://www.iconvention.ru/program/speakers_and_guests/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">list of speakers and guests</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was interested right away - we were registered on AngelList, and I knew that Dave McClure and Garry Tan are extremely well-known investors. It was clear that the chance is very unique, and it can not be lost. In addition, I was already in Digital October, and I knew well that at least I would be able to get to it by the morning of Moscow (then it was about 23 hours in Yekaterinburg). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vitaly confirmed our participation fairly quickly - probably as soon as he read my message. Probably, I was just the first of those who wrote to him - already in Digital October it turned out that he did not read my message carefully, i.e. it was pure luck.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the morning I was in Moscow. At the entrance to Digital October there was a rather long queue for registration - it became clear that there would be a lot of guests and participants. I checked in a little late - there was a hitch related to the fact that they invited me only yesterday, and went where my eyes were. I did not have the program of the event - as I understood, the organizers distributed all its circulation the day before. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the great hall was the opening of the convention. </font></font><a href="http://www.i-lift.tv/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Broadcast from this room</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(see the first entry) was conducted on many other screens, located both in the hall and in smaller rooms. The event was opened by Steve Wozniak and ... Vasily Yakimenko. I won‚Äôt be much mistaken if I say that for me it‚Äôs about the same thing as seeing Henry Ford and Joseph Goebbels speaking at the same time. By the way, in general, the event cannot be called politicized - everything that was said from the stage related to anything, but not to politics. The organizers made a lot of effort in order to make it as interesting as possible for participants and guests, for which they thank you so much.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, I found that the top investors from the United States ‚Äî Dave McClure, Garry Tan, and others ‚Äî are located on the stage next to the bar counter. It turned out that they have some very interesting sections in English, and they will all take place in this part of Digital October. And the funniest thing was that it was in this part that there were a lot of empty seats, although there were only ~ 70 chairs around the stage. It seems that most of those present either didn‚Äôt imagine what kind of people they were, or didn‚Äôt really understand live English.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, I spent most of my time in this part of the hall, talking to investors and startups that I found interesting in the breaks. It turned out that all the partners of YC are completely friendly and pleasant people who are no different from most people in appearance. If you spoke to them on the street, I would put 1000 to one that you would not recognize in them investors, who valued several thousand startups a year, and investing in dozens.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the most colorful figure was, perhaps, Dave McClure - he was the only one who did not hesitate, and periodically switched to the mat. In general, he was simply the most emotional, and if he was cursing, then he was cheerful and appropriate. By the way, I didn‚Äôt communicate with him - at the very beginning he said from the stage that all this wouldn‚Äôt work with great probability: ‚ÄúOnly the recommendations will work, so you shouldn‚Äôt bore me with pitches. Just imagine how many I hear every day, and how much it tires me sometimes "- if I remember correctly, the meaning of his words was like this. And I decided that it would be no worse if I talked to everyone else - if we make a really worthwhile product, I will find out about it anyway. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It makes no sense to talk about everything that happened on the stage - you can see for yourself.</font></font><a href="http://www.i-lift.tv/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">a full record of this</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (see the second video; by the way, there is also a version with translation into Russian). And I will tell you about the most important general conclusions from what I saw and heard in the next section. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the meantime, I was able to find out about our new idea in the breaks:</font></font><br><ul><li>         (YC).  ,                ,          .   ‚Äî  .    ,         ‚Äî    .    ,        ,       ,        ‚Äî     ,   .   ,     .   ,      ,       . </li><li>     - ‚Äî ",   ".     (  YC)    . ,    ,    ‚Äî "  ,  ,    100% ,     ‚Äî    ". </li><li> The conversation with Peter Westerback (creator of Angry Birds) was the most inspiring.  There was a feeling that he liked everything - and the service itself in its original version, and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits transformation into Group with Targeting.  He said literally the following: ‚ÄúIt sounds very logical, and therefore you just need to rest and do exclusively promotion. As a rule, it‚Äôs hard to say why such a service can take off, and therefore you should just try all the options, starting with the most interesting ". </li></ul>  By the way, emails and contacts willingly gave everything.  But I think in the coming days, it only makes sense to send an offer to two of the investors with whom I spoke.  In order to start communicating with YC or Dave McClure partners, we need to move forward with our plans a little further. <br><br>  In addition, I met the authors of three interesting startups: <ul><li>  <a href="http://ostrovok.ru/">ostrovok.ru</a> - service for booking hotels.  He was interested in me primarily by the fact that its founders at the moment ‚Äúraised‚Äù $ 13M.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/118303/">Here</a> you can read about their first round of investment. </li><li>  <a href="http://questli.com/">questli.com</a> is a service for carrying out real quests with real prizes (by the way, the new 9facts also has something in common with it).  Its founder <a href="http://about.me/danilka">Danil Kozyatnikov</a> is not only a talented entrepreneur, but also a master of self-presentation.  Read how he presented questli.com on LeWeb, and for what exactly he received the Audience Choice Award on TechCrunch Disrupt 2011 - IMO, this is fucking awesome.  If you‚Äôre too lazy to search, <a href="http://gad.ru/blog/Novosti/Mr-Danil-Kozyatnikov-mezhdunarodnyy-chelovek-startaper-iz-Sibiri-zapuskaet-PassMyWill-com.html">read this article and watch a video</a> about how he got on LeWeb in 2010. </li><li>  <a href="http://resumup.com/">resumup.com</a> is a service for quickly compiling and publishing your own resume.  By the way, just 2 days ago they became the winners of TechCrunch Startup Battle. </li></ul>  That's all.  It‚Äôs too early to write about any results of a visit to iConvention, but I think I can tell you everything in a couple of months. <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br><h4>  About planning, launching and promoting startups </h4><br><h5>  1. You must do everything to start as early as possible and begin to analyze the real needs of your customers. </h5><br>  All your plans are based on hypotheses, most of which are not tested by the market.  And early prototype production is often the best (and sometimes the only) way to test them. <br><br>  "There are no facts inside your building, so get outside!"  - such a signature was left by Steve Blank on each copy of his <a href="http://prostobook.com/product/11-871196/">‚ÄúFour Steps to Illumination‚Äù</a> , presented to the participants of the Start-up Rocket.  She is about that. <br><br><h5>  2. It is very important that the money that you "raised" during the first round should be enough not only to develop and launch a prototype, but also to demonstrate that your product has a market.  You just have to show traction, otherwise the next investor will be very, very difficult to find. </h5><br>  Perhaps this is the most important conclusion I have received over the past couple of months of work on 9facts.  We "raised" the amount, which was enough for the development and launch of 9facts, but ... We had almost no reserves, and the original plan was too optimistic.  And this means that I will have to spend much more time searching for money right now, and probably pay more for it than I would like. <br><br>  I think in the future we need to keep in mind that in almost 100% of cases, the original idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup degenerates into something else, but this ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù cannot be obtained without seeing your potential customers and not offering them something that they can start using.  The first version of the product you created is the first step towards customers, which is necessary in any case.  But the important thing is that it is not the last: it‚Äôs likely that you will not do what your customers want to use en masse.  So, you must have a reserve of resources for adaptation. <br><br>  My recommendation is as follows: plan that the amount raised during the first round should last about 1 year of development (+ a small amount of progress).  But you have to start as soon as possible.  If it works out - after 1 month, if not - after 2, 3, 4 ... I think ~ 6 months after the start of work is the latest acceptable time limit. <br><br>  The longer you pull the launch, the more unnecessary functionality you risk to do, and the less adaptation resources you have left. <br><br><h5>  3. ‚ÄúGive them a product and they will come‚Äù does not work for IT startups </h5><br>  This statement we checked in our own skin.  It seemed to us that we are doing a new and interesting thing, which means there must be some share of users on the web who will go to us on their own and immediately.  As a result, we have practically not been engaged in promotion so far: announcements in the local network media and mailings on the client base X-tensive.com - that's all that has been done. <br><br>  Now it is clear to us that it was pointless to promote the service.  It was worth considering at least the fact that so far there has not been a single English-language service that has become extremely popular in Russia.  I already wrote that we found a solution, and now we are engaged in its implementation.  But generally speaking, one could guess this without tests.  If we took this path right away, probably in October we could launch what we are planning to launch in January. <br><br>  So, very simple, but very difficult in terms of implementation advice: think about how to attract users to your resource.  You will have to do more than just an interesting product: you must ensure that everyone blows about it, and especially those who can refer you to the users you need.  And they will be ready to talk about you in only two cases: <br><ul><li>  Your product is already mega-known, and therefore everyone is talking about you.  A great option, but if you have just started promoting your product, it is not for you. </li><li>  They see a direct benefit from bringing new users to you.  In this case, this is not about ordinary advertising - for a startup it is too expensive.  You still do not know what your sales funnel is, and therefore you will most likely spend more than earn.  We are talking about options that allow your promotion partners to earn on your users.  Apple AppStore is a typical example of such a promotion tool. </li></ul>  If you find a working promotion channel for several months, you will have an excellent traction.  If not - you just run out of money. <br><br><h5>  4. It is important to believe in what you are doing, but by no means blindly. </h5><br>  Sooner or later, but you have to adapt.  And if this is not done on time, your startup will most likely die. <br><br>  On the other hand, at each moment in time you must firmly know what exactly you are doing now, and why.  Do not adjust your goals too often, otherwise you just will not come anywhere.  And for this you need to believe that you have chosen the right path.  But not blindly! <br><br><h5>  5. Do whatever it takes to reach your customers and find your market.  All that is required. </h5><br>  I seriously thought about the significance of this statement when we decided to radically change the service. <br><blockquote>  If you‚Äôre looking for a product that‚Äôs been successful, it‚Äôs always a good deal. CEO sleeping with the venture capitalist.  And the startup is still successful. <br><br>  Do whatever is required to get to product / market fit.  If you‚Äôre looking for your product, you‚Äôre reforming your . <br><br>  <i>- Marc Andreessen, Founder, Netscape</i> <br></blockquote><br><h5>  6. Criticism is different </h5><br>  I already wrote that ordinary people and investors evaluate projects completely differently.  You will have to learn to filter all criticism and assessments, highlighting the most important things from the general flow. <br><br>  My filtering rule is quite simple - attention to specific criticism should be proportional to: <br><ul><li>  the proximity of his field of activity or interest to the topic of a startup </li><li>  value of his time. </li></ul>  Finally, be prepared for the fact that there will always be people willing to spend incredible efforts to prove to you that nothing will work out for you - just to say once again: ‚ÄúWell, I told you so!‚Äù.  Most often this is not an expert assessment: <br><ul><li>  Most people give predictions based on the total likelihood of events.  They are pleased to stand on the side where the probability of success is higher, since it is very easy to give forecasts with good accuracy on this side (by the way, as the elections show, this is especially important in our country).  Imagine a doctor who is not able to distinguish a healthy person from a patient, but knowing that almost all visitors to the hospital are sick with something, and therefore his every diagnosis is ‚ÄúIll!‚Äù. </li><li>  So, you need not listen to them.  A real expert is one who is able to make predictions with an accuracy that is significantly higher than the average (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%2527_theorem">Bayes' theorem</a> ). </li></ul><br><h4>  About investors </h4><br><h5>  1. Traction - this is almost all that interests the "big" investors. </h5><br>  This was discussed many times both from the iConvention scene, and during conversations during the breaks.  What is traction?  These are strong indicators that your project will ‚Äúfly up‚Äù.  Examples of such indicators are the explosive growth of income or user base.  But in general, traction is all that says that your startup is moving fast in the right direction.  Signing a contract with a major player in the market (‚Äúif they need it, they probably need it a lot‚Äù), attracting a well-known investor is all traction. <br><br>  If you do not have traction, only your track record, track records of co-founders, good references, etc. can help you. <br><br><h5>  2. There are two types of startups: those that run for investors, and those that investors themselves run for.  Traction is all that distinguishes the second type from the first. </h5><br>  This is another formulation of the first paragraph, and most likely, it is somewhat closer to reality.  Investors are ready to unite with each other to increase the amount of investment, to make a deal with a higher valuation of value and to do a lot of other concessions for you, if you have traction. <br><br>  Conversely, you can spend all your time searching for them, but there will be no result until you show a traction. <br><br><h5>  3. The fact that ‚Äúbig‚Äù investors are exclusively interested in global projects is a myth </h5><br>  In fact, the size of the market share and its characteristics are important.  If it is clear that it is large enough, and your chances of gaining a foothold on it are very high, you will probably be able to interest the investor.  But if the market is small, or there is high competition in it, you will most likely be told no. <br><br>  An example of a project confirming this conclusion is ostrovok.ru. <br><br><h5>  4. They also do not care in which country the project founders are located. </h5><br>  Yes, it is, and this was also said many times from the stage.  The country in which the company is located now does not play any role, all other things being equal, and the startup Danila Koziatnikova (by the way, he hails from Angarsk) is a vivid confirmation of this. <br><br><h5>  5. English! </h5><br>  If you want to find investors outside of the Russian Federation - without this, simply nothing.  Investors hate to communicate through a translator - it takes at least three times more time, and besides, there is no certainty that you hear exactly what the other side is saying.  Imagine that you have only two minutes, and estimate how much time the translation will eat. <br><br>  In addition, if you yourself can not submit your project, you probably will not be able to communicate with customers - that's how investors look at it. <br><br>  Here is an example from real life: 3 projects on Start-up Rocket presented themselves as translators, and the main presentation went very smoothly.  But over the next 5 minutes, their authors managed to answer only 2-3 questions;  and the most unpleasant was that after the main part all the translators left, and as a result, the authors of the relevant projects lost the opportunity to communicate with Steve and other interesting people.  But the rest of the startups enjoyed it with pleasure, so that each of them had noticeably more than 10 minutes allotted for the presentation in the framework of the main part. <br><br><h5>  6. Elevator pitch, made for the investor personally, often works better than the presentation at the competition </h5><br>  This is my personal experience.  I think the fact is that in personal communication you can remove a lot of questions right away, and in addition, you can correct the pitch by evaluating the emotional reaction of the interlocutor.  For example, if you see that the last phrase you said caused bewilderment, you can give a more detailed explanation.  Conversely, if everything goes smoothly, you can safely move on, skipping less important details.  ^ ^ On the other hand, the ability to make excellent presentations is an incredibly useful skill. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  I am grateful to everyone who read this opus to the end - it seems that I have never written such an amount of text before.  I really wanted to write briefly about everything, but for some reason it didn‚Äôt work out - it‚Äôs still difficult to squeeze in several paragraphs for almost 8 months of my life.  Apparently, the additions will be brief. <br><br>  Finally - a small instruction for those who decide to compare themselves with others at <a href="http://9facts.com/">9facts</a> : <br><ul><li>  Specify your city or country when registering, otherwise your facts will not fall into the tops of the city and country.  We are trying to determine the city or country by IP, but so far this option does not always give the correct result. </li><li>  Turn on the fact providers.  In a few minutes the service will collect the facts from the services that you have connected, but they will fall into the ratings within 4 hours. </li><li>  Try adding a fact manually.  If there are no ideas, take a look at the <a href="http://9facts.com/User/Top">global rating of facts</a> , or a <a href="http://9facts.com/User/Facts">list of the most recently added facts</a> .  In the context menu of each fact there is "Add fact like this". </li><li>  Join a group, or create a new one.  For each group, it also builds its own fact rating. </li><li>  Invite friends.  By the way, you can invite a friend (or several) in one action and create a fact about him - for this you need to enter an e-mail in the search field when selecting those to whom the created fact relates.  Facts created for friends will be private until they themselves make them public. </li></ul>  I will be glad to any of your questions and comments.  And even more interesting ideas about improving or promoting 9facts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134054/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134054/</a></p>
