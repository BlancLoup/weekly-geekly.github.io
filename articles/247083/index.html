      Answer: Conduct a serious study of user behavior. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We are all different, but in many cases our brain tends to react in the same way.  If you understand the subtleties of the human mind, you can easily find creative ways to push more customers to the cherished "Yes!" For your products or services. <br><br>  In this article we will talk about 5 studies that study these processes in the minds of your customers.  Dive! <br><br><h4>  Chapter 1 </h4><br>  <b>Overcome inaction</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Details are important when it comes to copywriting.  An interesting study was conducted by Dr. Robert Tsialdini, Professor of Psychology at Arizona State University.  He studied the donation process of the American Cancer Society, and saw a penny difference lead to completely different results. <br><br>  The study also shows how important it is to analyze why people say no, and this is more important than understanding why they say yes. <br><br>  <b>Study</b> <br><br>  Below are two phrases that are used to collect donations.  Researchers tested the effect of a minor change in formulation. <br><br>  1. Are you ready to make a donation? <br>  2. Are you ready to make a donation?  Every penny is important. <br><br>  Subtle difference, is not it? <br><br>  The difference in words is insignificant, but the effect is striking. <br><br>  <b>Result</b> <br><br>  People who were asked question number 2, donated almost twice as often. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/428/0fb/6da/4280fb6da93b4a35a07dc6503423e696.png"><br><br>  The researchers stated: <br><br>  People are ready to act when minimum requirements are set. <br><br>  People may ask themselves if they have enough money to donate and whether this will change the situation.  But specifying that ‚Äúeven a penny‚Äù will help, people respond to the call more readily: the switch ‚Äúcan I donate?‚Äù Often switches to ‚Äúyes‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>The best part of the study</b> <br><br>  Donors donated twice as much in response to the second question, but the amount of donations was not less.  Knowing that even a penny would be enough, they gave as much as the respondents who were asked the first question. <br><br>  <b>In the dry residue</b> <br><br>  Bearing in mind that a small action is already a good start, people are more inclined to take the first step.  If you are pushing people to action, mark clearly the minimum they must do to overcome the effect of paralysis. <br><br><h4>  Chapter 2 </h4><br>  <b>Master the power of the label</b> <br><br>  You might think this refers to the brand label, but we are talking about something else.  We suggest you label / categorize customers. <br><br>  Sounds like bad advice, right?  WRONG! <br><br>  Research shows that people like to be tagged, and they are more susceptible to the message if they feel involved in a particular group. <br><br>  <b>Study</b> <br><br>  The researchers checked the voting results of 133 adults to see how the labeling affects turnout at polling stations.  At first, the participants were casually asked for whom they usually vote.  After this, half were told that they were recognized as politically active and would most likely go to the next elections.  The other half of the group said nothing. <br><br>  It was not true, people were chosen at random. <br><br>  <b>results</b> <br><br>  Despite the random choice, the group that was told that they were politically active had a turnout of 15% more than the other group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/550/132/d01/550132d0101c46dbb3ebc440ce68bad3.png"><br><br>  Our brain tends to preserve a sense of community (even if it is artificial), which is why hook strategies work so well on a prepared mind. <br><br>  People who are labeled as ‚Äúbest‚Äù consumers spend more, while others from the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù class are not influenced. <br>  - <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/31/12653.abstract">Source: Motivating Voter Turnout by Invoking the Self</a> <br><br>  <b>In the dry residue</b> <br>  Do not be afraid to label your customers.  People love to be part of the group that serves the best service.  Even when the reason for dividing is clearly artificial, people are more likely to perform the action due to their sense of belonging to an ‚Äúelite‚Äù group of people.  That is why the ‚Äúgolden‚Äù or ‚Äúplatinum‚Äù statuses work effectively for client loyalty programs. <br><br><h4>  Chapter 3 </h4><br>  <b>Three types of client</b> <br><br>  No matter what industry you work in, research on customer behavior shows that there are three groups of customers that may differ in the type of ‚Äúpain‚Äù they experience when they buy what they need. <br><br>  <b>Study</b> <br>  Neurophysicists have defined the pattern of people's spending as a process "to spend, until it got sick!".  Therefore, understanding the different levels of ‚Äúpain‚Äù is important in order to maximize sales. <br><br>  <b>Types of customers:</b> <br><br>  1. Ordinary buyers. <br>  2. People who can spend more before I feel the maximum "pain of the buyer." <br>  3. People who spend less before they feel the maximum "pain of the buyer." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fba/d44/07d/fbad4407d4b24a70acd78ede065abe4e.png"><br><br>  <b>results</b> <br><br>  Which type is the hardest to convert?  Miserly. <br><br>  After they have made up almost a quarter of your potential buyers, you should learn a few sensible techniques to minimize the buyer's pain for your misguided customers. <br><br>  Fortunately, the secret comes down to using two simple strategies. <br><br>  <b>1. Rethinking Prices</b> <br><br>  If you see software that costs 60,000 rubles a year, you will definitely take a caution with your purchase, right? <br><br>  Right!  Because 60,000 rubles a year is not a trifle.  If not more, this seems like a HUGE amount of money for the average buyer. <br><br>  And what if, instead, the product costs only 5,000 rubles.  per month?  Not bad, huh? <br><br>  The fact is that 5000 rubles per month = 60 000 rubles per year! <br><br>  If this method of rethinking is effective for all types of clients, then it is most effective for conservative buyers.  If your product needs to be paid regularly or you have the opportunity to break the price, learn how you can use this information in your pricing model. <br><br>  <b>2. Reduce the number of pain points by combining</b> <br><br>  Neuroeconomic expert George Lowenstein noted that all consumers (especially conservative buyers) prefer to make a purchase in one fell swoop, rather than buying a lot of accessories separately. <br><br>  He refers to the willingness of customers to update all Autopackages at once and points out how difficult it is for the brain to find the reason for buying each individual update (‚ÄúYes, I will pay for navigation and parking, and signaling ... and ...‚Äù etc.) . <br><br>  Multiple purchases create multiple pain points, while bundled purchases create only one pain point, even if the price is much higher. <br><br>  Lowenstein's study shows how many consumers are willing to pay more for the full package, rather than chasing individual products and accessories: this is not only less of a hassle, but as a result, there are less pain points. <br>  - <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/practical/2007/winter/spending-til-it-hurts.shtml">Source: Spend 'Til It Hurts</a> <br><br>  <b>In the dry residue</b> <br><br>  No matter what business you work in, it is important to understand how to work with the types of customers.  Misers constitute the base of your potential customers - learn them to sell.  The right choice of words can significantly reduce the pain of the buyer. <br><br><h4>  Chapter 4 </h4><br>  <b>Highlight benefits and acknowledge weaknesses.</b> <br><br>  Is it a good idea to admit your blunders?  In addition, people do not want to know all the ugly truth about you, right? <br><br>  A study by social psychologist Fiona Lee found that admitting flaws is a great way to highlight your strength. <br><br>  Lee's research was aimed at measuring the effect of missteps and errors on stock prices.  Experimenters read one of two fictitious company reports.  Both reports explained the reasons why the company showed a loss in the last year. <br><br>  <b>Study</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  -The first report focuses on strategic decisions. <br>  - In the second - focus on external events. <br>  (economy, competition, etc.) <br><br>  <b>results</b> <br><br>  The subjects sympathized with the first company much more than the second.  Recognizing the flaws in strategic thinking, the report demonstrates that the company is still in control. <br><br>  After checking out hundreds of these types of reports, Lee found that companies that admit their strategic mistakes had stock prices rising next year. <br><br>  When a company blames external forces for its failure, even if the reason is really in them, it gives skeptics a reason to think that they cannot solve this problem, in addition to the consideration that these might just be excuses. <br>  - <a href="http://psp.sagepub.com/content/30/12/1636.abstract">Source: Predicting Stock Prices From Organizational Attributions</a> <br><br>  <b>In the dry residue</b> <br><br>  Honest admission of mistakes helps customers understand that you still have control over the situation and are not inclined to make excuses. <br><br><h4>  Chapter 5 </h4><br><br>  <b>Use urgency wisely</b> <br><br>  Creating a feeling ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù is one of the oldest tricks in marketing. <br>  Dr. Robert Cialdini noted the deficit as one of the six pillars of influence, and just to understand why: high demand leads to big sales. <br><br>  The following study explains why urgency can backfire on you and destroy your carefully written marketing materials.  How can you prevent this? <br><br>  <b>Study</b> <br><br>  The study is a classic work by Howard Levental, where he analyzes the effect of distributing brochures about tetanus.  Leventhal conducted a study, handing out two different brochures, not sparing a detailed description of the terrible effects that tetanus leaves on the body.  The first brochure describes only the effects of tetanus, and the second includes information on where to get the vaccine. <br><br>  <b>results</b> <br><br>  The rate at which those who read the second pamphlet were vaccinated was almost 25% higher than in the first group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f4/6ff/12f/6f46ff12f4cd497cbcfcc828e2e951fc.png"><br><br>  Leventhal also created a separate group of those who received a ‚Äúless terrible‚Äù version of a brochure describing tetanus in a much more moderate description and without any graphic images.  He noted that these participants reacted as well as those who received the standard ‚Äúterrible‚Äù version (without further information). <br>  - <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/2/1/20/">Source: Effects of Fear and Specificity of Attitudes and Behavior</a> <br><br>  It was only possible to call an immediate reaction when subsequent instructions were given. <br><br>  Those who received the follow-up information were also more impressed with the brochure as a whole, being able to clarify more specific information from it than other participants. <br><br>  Although the additional information provided in the second brochure was not exhaustive, Leventhal was able to show that our consciousness blocks information about urgency, if there are no clear instructions on what to do next. <br><br>  He showed that those who did not receive information about subsequent actions were inclined to convince themselves that "I do not need to worry about this, because it will not happen to me, in any case," while the participants the groups had no reason to feel this way because they had a plan of action. <br><br>  <b>In the dry residue</b> <br><br>  Urgency can be blocked by the minds of your customers, if you do not give them specific instructions on how to solve this problem.  Instead of giving vague instructions, tell people what to do when the time comes, and do not be afraid to lead them to concrete actions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247083/</a></p>
