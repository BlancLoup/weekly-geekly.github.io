  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian microprocessors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once more Soviet computers occupied a leading position among their competitors.  This is hard to believe, but the famous BESM-6 (the first in the USSR based on transistors and IP), developed under the guidance of the legendary Sergei Lebedev, calculated the flight path of the Soyuz-19 spacecraft and the American Apollo! <br>  But it was in the 70s, now Russia can hardly boast of its computer industry.  The purpose of the following is to find out what is going on with Russian computer engineering today and is waiting for it in the future ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The collapse of the USSR completely degraded our high-tech production, but there remained scientific centers that did not cease to develop. <br><br>  ITMiVT (Institute of Fine Mechanics and Computer Engineering) in the early 90s presented the Elbrus-3 complex, developed under the guidance of B. A. Babayan.  It contained 16 superscalar processors.  Only one such machine was released, but it could not with the systems of that time. <br>  A little earlier, Vladimir Pentkovsky, all in the same ITMIVT, was engaged in the development of the El 90 microprocessor.  He carried on board a cache, divided into data and commands, could work in the mode of secure computing (which was required by the Army), supported work in conjunction with several such processors. <br>  However, the change of leadership in the country did not make his dreams come true, and later he was lured away by Intel, in which he became the key developer of the Pentium III.  Pentkovsky and Pentium - isn‚Äôt it, it seems? <br>  But B. Babayan did not stop, he began to develop the micro-architecture "Elbrus 2000" or E2K.  This microprocessor had a decent at that time 1.2 GHz clock frequency.  He avoided all his rivals, having smaller dimensions and heat release. <br>  In the series, he never came out, the reason for that elementary - funding.  Well, in 2004, the whole team of Boris Babayan bought Intel, and then a little later, the revolutionary Core 2 Duo came out, and, most likely, not without the participation of Babayan. <br>  Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.mcst.ru/">Moscow Center Spark Technologies</a> , founded by ITM &amp; T <a href="http://www.mcst.ru/">,</a> developed state-owned microprocessors of the MCST-R family.  The MCTS-R150 processor, operating at a frequency of 150 MHz, carrying 2.8 million transistors on board, formed the basis of the Elbrus-90micro Computational Complex. <br><img src="http://www.mcst.ru/images/10-11_img_2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Such a cabinet was adopted in 2001 for the supply of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.  He worked, of course, under the control of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/linux/79977/">OS MSVS</a> . <br>  Three years later, one coffin was replaced with another, but with the MCST-R500 processor.  The frequency has increased - 500 MHz, and the process technology has changed - 130 nm, which made it possible to place 4.9 million transistors in it. <br><img src="http://www.mcst.ru/images/12-13_img_4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The dual-core model MCST-R500S operates on the same process technology and at the same frequency, but already has 2 cores and almost 10 times more transistors.  At the moment, this processor is available as part of the MVC / S processor module, which is connected via the CompactPCI bus. <br><img src="http://sw.4pda.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2-240x195.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The development also includes a quad-core processor model - MCST-4R.  It will work at a frequency of 1 GHz and have ‚Äúwhole‚Äù 1.5 MB L2 cache. <br><img src="http://www.mcst.ru/img_b/23.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In parallel, the MCST conducted work on the continuation of "Elbrus-3".  In 2008, the Elbrus-3M model was introduced.  The developers themselves do not hide that the ‚Äúgrandfather‚Äù - ‚ÄúElbrus-3‚Äù is taken almost 20 years ago. <br><img src="http://www.mcst.ru/img_b/4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  No matter how ridiculous this may sound, its frequency is 300 MHz, however this ‚Äúflaw‚Äù must be compensated by parallelism ‚Äî the processor can process up to 23 commands per clock.  "Elbrus-3M" will be supplied as part of 64-processor Computational Complexes.  It is clear that the military. <br>  The successor of the "three" - "Elbrus-S". <br><img src="http://www.mcst.ru/image/Elbrus_S_top_bot.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It works on the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù frequency of 500 MHz, and the process technology has changed - 90 nm (I note that even the video card manufacturers have already switched to the 45 nm process technology).  Cache memory of the second level as much as 2 MB, only its bandwidth does not please - only 16 Gb / s!  But the power consumption of some 20 watts, therefore, the heat dissipation is "scanty". <br><br>  Without plans to bankrupt, Intel is kept apart by the <a href="http://www.module.ru/">SEC Module</a> .  For example, their digital receiver with a hard-to-pronounce name, VLSI K1879HK1Ya, is used for digital signal processing in GLONASS, GPS, GSM systems.  They also produce high-definition digital television signal decoders (after all, as everyone knows, Russia is switching to a ‚Äúdigit‚Äù).  Well, of course they don‚Äôt forget about the military - there are various radiation-resistant microchips in their products.

      Well, that's all the microprocessor capital of Russia. <br>  I want to believe that in the depths of the secret CBs, Russian scientists are working on a 48-core processory, which will put the entire silicon valley on the shoulder blades, but for now we will only have to dream ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127683/</a></p>
