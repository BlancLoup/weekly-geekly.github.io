Secrets of the world's best inspirational presentations. ‚Äù  Author: Jeremy Donovan. <br><br>  It‚Äôs probably worth starting from the TED conference itself.  There really perform very talented people, many performances inspire, attract attention.  Of course, not all.  And not all speeches fall on the TED channel in the form in which they occurred at the conference itself.

      It‚Äôs better to see once than hear a hundred times, so if you haven‚Äôt yet seen or heard about TED, it's time to visit the <a href="http://www.ted.com/">official website of TED</a> and plunge into the world of wonder.  Under the cut - check-list for a speech from the book "Performance in the style of TED". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now about the book.  Honestly, I expected more.  I left very few marks on the margins, and put the book 2 points out of 10 possible.  The basic information is contained at the very end of each chapter, and I will give these points below.  I note that Jeremy Donovan‚Äôs advice will indeed suit those who are going to speak at a large conference soon, for those who are to have a more ‚Äúmodest‚Äù event - the advice will certainly fit, but to a lesser extent.  In addition, the book clearly does not take into account subtleties, for example, working with a microphone and working with an audience without a microphone, clothing style, working with tools, gifts and engaging the audience in a discussion. <br><br>  I suggest everyone to leave their notes and comments about a good performance in public. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 1. Spread Your Ideas </h3><br>  This chapter provides recommendations for the TED conference itself. <br><br>  <b>The content of the speech:</b> <br><ol><li>  Be sincere.  Do not flaunt your ego.  Do not brag - this is the most reliable way to lose the attention of the audience. </li><li>  Dream great.  Show what no one has ever seen.  Do something that the audience will remember forever.  Share an idea that can change the world. </li><li>  Tell stories.  Do not try to blind the intellect.  Do not speak the language of abstractions.  Explain!  Give examples.  Be specific. </li><li>  No sales from the stage!  Do not advertise your company, products or products.  Do not ask for money for your needs. </li><li>  Joke more often.  Humor helps to keep attention during the performance. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>Material feed:</b> <br><ol><li>  Create an emotional bond.  Make us laugh!  Make us cry! </li><li>  Feel free to comment on other speeches, praise or criticize.  Contradictions give energy!  Keeping something enthusiastic is great! </li><li>  Show yourself to the present.  Share your hobbies, your dreams - and even your fears.  Be vulnerable.  Talk about failures, as well as successes. </li><li>  Do not read the speech.  It is allowed to have small notes.  But if the choice is between reading and incoherent speech - read! </li><li>  Finish on time.  To delay a speech is to steal time from people following you. </li></ol><br><br><h2>  Part 1. Content, structure and presentation format </h2><br><h3>  Chapter 2. How to choose a topic for a speech </h3><br>  Choose one single idea that can change people's outlook or force them to act. <br>  To enhance the interest of listeners, supplement your story with stories and facts. <br>  Establish an emotional connection with the audience, appealing to the deep needs of all people: in love, communication, personal growth and hope for a bright future. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 3. How to create a key phrase </h3><br>  Imagine the essence of your idea as a bright memorable phrase from three to twelve words long. <br>  Make the phrase rhythmic, put in it the impulse to action. <br>  During the speech, repeat it at least three times. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 4. How to introduce yourself to the audience </h3><br>  Write for the presenter a short text of the presentation related to the topic of the presentation. <br>  Do not forget to specify in it, why you have the right to talk about this topic. <br>  Make sure that you are presented as a person trustworthy, but not created with the aura of genius. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 5. How to start a performance </h3><br>  Start with an introduction if the mood in the hall does not match the tone of the performance. <br>  Start with a personal story, a shocking statement or a discouraging question. <br>  Complete the introduction by showing the audience what to expect from your presentation and when you can get it. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 6. How to build the main part of the speech </h3><br>  At each transition, try to briefly summarize what was just said and enliven the attention of the listeners. <br>  Divide the text of the main part of the speech into three components in accordance with the model ‚Äúsituation ‚Äî complication - isolation‚Äù. <br>  Combine the presentation of facts with emotional stories. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 7. How to complete a speech </h3><br>  Make it clear that the end of the show is near. <br>  Explain why your idea is important. <br>  Push the audience to action, creating a sense of significance of the moment and prompting a simple first step. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 8. How to tell stories </h3><br>  Tell stories from your personal experiences and observations. <br>  Show, not tell, using colorful descriptions, believable characters and detailed dialogues. <br>  Turn the story into an emotional journey in which heroes successfully overcome obstacles to a great goal. <br><br><h2>  Part 2. Material feed </h2><br><h3>  Chapter 9. How to improve the skills of verbal presentation of the material. </h3><br>  Speak as if you are having a lively one-on-one conversation. <br>  Add diversity to speech by modulating its volume and tempo. <br>  Freely use the word "you", referring to the audience as one person. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 10. How to use humor </h3><br>  Refer to the jokes about yourself, exaggerating and ridiculing those in power to bring a little humor to your speech. <br>  Use humor in the dialogues. <br>  Correctly pick up moments for jokes and use combinations of three jokes in the appropriate places.  On average, stick to the norm of one joke per minute. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 11. How to apply gestures and gestures </h3><br>  Start the performance, keeping your hands at ease;  gesticulating at a level above the waist and below the neck. <br>  Follow the mimicry of words. <br>  Maintain eye contact with listeners for three to five seconds.  Speaking to a large audience, address individual sections of the hall for one to three minutes. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 12. How to create an inspiring visual accompaniment </h3><br>  As far as possible, try not to use slides. <br>  Make the slides simple, bright, but do not oversaturated them with text. <br>  Highlight highlights.  by choosing the colors, fonts and location of the object on the slide. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 13. How to overcome fear </h3><br>  Rehearse at least three times to gain confidence on stage. <br>  Come to the place in advance to get comfortable and check everything last time. <br>  Remember: the audience wants you to succeed. <br><br>  <b>From the author</b> : I would recommend to see the top 10 TED speeches before the show.  It‚Äôs better and simpler than trying to memorize the entire checklist. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286112/</a></p>
