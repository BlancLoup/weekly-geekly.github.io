  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reasoning on the topic: what would I like to see in BitTorrent</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>On the wave of BitTorrent habratopic <a href="http://vig7.habrahabr.ru/blog/97730/">clients and the need to open ports, I manually</a> remembered my ideas about what could be done if Torrent wrote to me.</i>  <i>Actually I also want to share these thoughts with you% habrauzer%.</i> <br><br>  In essence, I basically have two main complaints about such a highly developed client and BitTorrent clients, and I would like to change them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Oh these files </h5><br>  Everyone is accustomed to the fact that BitTorrent allows you to transfer both single files and groups of files with folders in one torrent.  The main disadvantage is, it seems to me, especially at the time of entry into the DHT masses, just this inability to split the torrent file into smaller entities (files) and look for them separately in the DHT (not with handles, but automatically). <br>  That is, consider a hypothetical situation: <br>  On tracker A, Vasya posted the Lost series with 20 episodes, and on tracker B, Peter posted the same series from the same series, but added subtitles to the torrent.  It would seem that it prevents the client (for example, torrent) from splitting the torrent into entities and in essence merging these two torrents in part by borrowing the same parts from each other. <br><br>  I'm not talking about the issue of implementation, although as a programmer I do not see this as a particular problem.  Even making an add-on over Torrent (or some kind of torrentlib.dll) it would be possible to implement such a feature with a small amount of perversion.

      I think talking about the advantages of this approach is not necessary because they are already understandable with the naked eye. <br><br><h5>  Oh these folders </h5><br>  The second thing that bothers me in BotTorrent clients is a tight binding to the name and location of the file.  No, I do not suggest BitTorrent to look for files all over my screw.  I just just want to, that in the folder indicated to him he would have been completely fucked about the name of the file and I moved it from the internal folder or not.  The most striking example of such a thing is to rename the subtitles ... or move them to a video.  It is clear that in most cases you can answer this: ‚Äúwhy transfer, copy and not suffer‚Äù, but on the other hand, if this problem can be solved in 10 minutes (just at the beginning, counting the hashes of the files in the folder and comparing them with what is written in the torrent), I do not understand why this inconvenience still has a place to exist.  In the end, it is unlikely that the file name or its exact position somehow affects the distribution ... the same name is fixed in the torrent, it also allows the indication of the md5 file in the same place ... <br><br>  It is clear that this is a small plus.  But I, as a user of Torrent, are sometimes hampered by the inability to rename or move the file within the torrent catalog without unnecessary haemorrhage to maintain distribution. <br><br>  In general ... I do not pretend to originality.  These are just thoughts that I expressed to my friends and they liked them.  Maybe someone will hear me and will implement it in future versions of MegaPuperRaTorrentClient ... and I will be happy to use it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97737/</a></p>
