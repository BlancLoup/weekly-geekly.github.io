  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unfulfilled dream of the richest man on the planet (to the 60th anniversary of Bill Gates)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, October 28, the 60th anniversary is celebrated by the founder of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> , the richest man in the world, Bill Gates.  The publication Business Insider <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-fabulous-life-of-bill-gates-2015-10">decided to</a> recall the major milestones in the biography of the famous entrepreneur and altruist. <br><br>  William Henry Gates the Third (or just Bill Gates) was born in 1955 in Seattle.  His father was a well-known lawyer, his mother served on the board of directors of a large bank.  And Bill‚Äôs parents themselves have been pursuing a career as a lawyer. <br><br>  From the age of 12, the boy became so interested in computers that he abandoned other subjects - social studies, grammar and other humanities.  Nevertheless, the future founder of Microsoft had excellent results in mathematics, Gates even dreamed of becoming a professor in this field.  But his fate was quite different. <a name="habracut"></a>  If this dream came true, now there would not be Microsoft, the Windows operating system, everyone‚Äôs favorite mouse and other things without which we can‚Äôt imagine our life.

At the age of 17, together with a friend, Paul Allen, they trailed Traf-O-Data, whose products helped read traffic and generate reports. <br><br>  In 1973, at the insistence of his parents, Gates entered Harvard.  However, Gates abandoned his studies and spent his time playing games and programming.  Two years after receipt, he was expelled. <br><br>  By that time, Gates and Allen had already gotten a job at the then well-known company MITS, which created the Altair 8800 computer. <br>  Then there were the first ideas for creating your own company.  Gates suggested the name Micro-soft (from the words microprocessors and software). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e9b/5ac/c1e/e9b5acc1e9829f8309e2bd958b8a0253.jpg" alt="image" height="400"><br>  <i>Source: <a href="http://www.npr.org/news/graphics/2008/june/bill_gates/gates_timeline_04.html">NPR</a></i> <br><br>  In 1980, IBM proposed Microsoft to create an operating system for their new personal computer.  Gates acquires the QDOS system, changes the name to the more familiar to the rumor of MS-DOS and sells it to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">IBM</a> for $ 50,000.  The success of IBM computers with the new operating system inspired other companies to collaborate with Microsoft. <br><br>  The next step was the release of Microsoft Office and Microsoft Excel.  This has greatly expanded the expansion of Microsoft in the high-tech market and compete with Apple, which supplies computers on its own operating system. <br><br>  In 1985, Microsoft released the first versions of Windows, which were essentially a graphical extension for MS-DOS.  At the same time, the Mouse (modern "mouse") appears.  He set a new trend in the development of input devices.  Thirty years later, even despite the appearance of touchpads, the ‚Äúmouse‚Äù remains the most popular and convenient way to work with a PC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d61/90d/7b2/d6190d7b206adbc8cc6169e208fc8e0f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1986, the company entered the IPO.  Next, the company is engaged in product development and release of new versions of Windows. <br><br>  In 1995, Windows 95 appeared on the market, and Bill Gates became the richest businessman in the world with a fortune of $ 12.9 billion.  Since then, Gates has remained one of the richest people in the world. <br>  In the same year, the first version of Internet Explorer 1 was released. <br><br>  Microsoft has actively promoted all its products, leaving no chance to competitors.  She did it so energetically that she was interested in the US antitrust authorities.  In 1998, they began to file lawsuits against Microsoft, Gates himself was summoned to the court and asked to divide the company into parts, each of which would deal with different products, but the head of the board of directors, Bill Gates, remained adamant.  Accusations against Microsoft periodically appear until now. <br><br>  In 2000, he resigns as CEO. <br><br>  Together with his wife Melinda Gates, he does charity work under the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  The fund invests in improving health and fighting hunger in poor countries.  Funds are also being spent on HIV and AIDS treatment programs, to fight malaria.  In addition, the foundation provides full support to students and the US educational system as a whole.  In total, by 2010, Gates spent on charity about $ 28 billion. <br><br>  Today, Bill Gates withdrew from all affairs related to Microsoft.  Nevertheless, at his disposal about 8% of the company's shares, and about $ 78 billion on the account of Gates himself. <br><br>  In 2007, he nevertheless received a diploma from Harvard University, but as a friendly gesture, "as a gift." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/400/d86/f93/400d86f93e8abc7309365a6dd23c377f.jpg" alt="image" height="400"><br>  <i>Source: <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1988080_1988093_1988082,00.html">Time</a></i> <br><br>  The former head of Microsoft actively communicates with the press and organizes conferences on the Reddit portal.  Answering user questions, Gates shares his views on current issues of the day.  During the last conference with users of Reddit, Bill Gates stressed that he was afraid of the artificial intelligence of the future and regret that he does not speak foreign languages. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295806/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295806/</a></p>
