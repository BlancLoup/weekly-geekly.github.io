How to present your project?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The boom of Internet startups is not falling.  And a large number of people rushed to engage in venture capital investments.  More and more start-up factories looking for promising projects.  How do they do it? <br>  One of the ways - the organization of start-up conferences. <br><br>  And a bunch of young people who are trying to get money from an investor at all events gather at such events (most often they do not plan to return anything).  And it is necessary for these wonderful teams of specialists to present their project so that the investor wants to give his money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/278/d3e/680/278d3e680623df6ac4fdfa283eabea0d.jpg" alt="      " title="And all would live happily ever after">

      It would seem: if your task is to interest the investor, and this can be done with a presentation, then prepare a smart presentation.  It was not there! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since everything is put on stream, and there are a huge amount of projects, a small amount of time is allotted for the presentation (2 minutes on average).  You have only two (!) Minutes to interest investors.  Pathetic two minutes, for which you must give a maximum. <br><br>  What do we see at most of these conferences?  The categorical inability to present your own idea in 98% of cases.  Usually, the inability to present one‚Äôs own idea is combined with the lousiness of the project itself, so to speak smoothly from the project itself. <br><br>  People, going out for a presentation, do not count the time limit (often presentations are cut off in the middle of the story), they vaguely say, often something breaks and hangs, most read what is written in slides, etc. Watching this is very sad . <br><br>  Ilya Segalovich said that in the west the culture of the presentation is much higher than ours (although the projects are mostly of the same level).  People are great preparing.  And if the team has 2 minutes, it uses them to the maximum.  For example, one person from the team going out connects a laptop, starts a presentation, another at this time is already starting to talk about the project, etc.  Everything is honed to shine.  After such presentations, the investor has a strong desire to grab such a team by the scruff, and invest a lot of money.  (True, then comes the realization that the project itself is so-so.) <br><br>  What conclusion should be made?  It is impossible without a thorough preparation to present the project well! <br><br>  Presentation is also work.  If a person is not able to think up a good presentation for 2 minutes, what about business?  It is ridiculous to assume that such a person will be able to calculate something, and plan something. <br><br>  <b>What are the key points in the presentation of the project?</b> <br><br>  1. Technical part - most of the presentations I saw had technical problems (the console did not work, something did not turn on, was inhibited, etc.).  At times they spent half of their presentation on solving these problems! <br><br>  2. The emotional part is the ability to speak well and easily, to find contact with the audience, not to mumble oneself under one‚Äôs breath, speak clearly and confidently.  Able to speak in public among startups in general units, but this is the key moment of the success of the presentation. <br><br>  3. The information part - must be clearly metered.  It‚Äôs impossible to tell everything in two minutes.  The task is just to interest, attract.  Therefore, the information that you submit should be treated unfairly, leaving only what the investor can catch in two words. <br><br>  <b>Which of all this can be concluded?</b> <br><br>  The culture of presentation is culture.  You need to know what and how to do, then the matter of technology, training and preparation.  Unfortunately, most teams do not even take the first step - they do not realize that you need to prepare carefully for the presentation. <br><br>  On the site of start-up factories, I would develop a set of wishes for the presenters, and would necessarily send out the newsletter before the event.  Not the fact that it will work, but it will give at least a chance that start-upers will think before getting out to the public with a raw presentation. <br><br>  On the other hand, if people are not able to present their ideas, perhaps this will help good teams to look at them just gorgeous? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128880/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128880/</a></p>
