      So, for the beginning we will fall into the soft bosom of the lyrics, and imagine what ideally a design is.  The days when the design could be called multicolored text in the console, long gone.  Now wherever you spit - everywhere you will come across the fact that if the interface of an application / site / yes, in general, what programmers developed and the program / blah blah blah is not intended for the programmers / system administrators themselves and other people themselves, then simply smack the standard controls on the form - a clear path to failure.  Without design anywhere. <br><br>  The problem is complemented by such a concept as usability, which in our country is not just in embryo, but in the embryonic state.  He still has legs do not jerk, so what's there!  There are no legs as such, but it already plays a role.  Why?  Because we have Western software in front of our eyes, this is a very difficult thing to do, and generally pleasant to use.  And you take a domestic crafts - and here it is not convenient, and there is not, and here the panel of the fighter instead of the 10 necessary buttons. <br><br>  And ideally, the user should look at the finished product and say "cool!".  Well, or not to say, but at the same time run time after time and stay as long as possible.  It all depends on the tasks and themes. <br><br>  Thus, if we ordered a design from a freelancer - designer, then we are supposed to get a quality, beautiful, and easy-to-use picture of our future project.  We have to tell him - ‚Äúfriend!  After the director, who has organized this whole canoe and is looking for orders, and the team leader, who is forcing you to work together, you are the third to get the organism by the steepness! ‚Äù  Because that's how it turns out - be the application at least as fast and useful as you like, it will always be replaced with a beautiful application, which, albeit bursting into flame from all the cracks during installation, but ‚Äúwow, what a nyaka!‚Äù / * Went to wipe the language off bad things * / <br><br>  Design drives! <br><br><h4>  What is the reality </h4><br><br>  And the loss, as grit, let's consider what in practice. <br><br>  In this case, I will talk only about myself, and only about my experience.  It is difficult for me to talk about someone else, what is the truth, capital and banal.  I also apologize in advance to the entire design community, I sincerely believe that among you there are those whom we lack so much, but for some reason I don‚Äôt meet.  What can I say - I have such a person, who dug up a lot of literature on this topic, and from which pen the masterpieces come out in terms of simplicity and convenience, but unfortunately I temporarily detached myself from the pleasure of work, which makes me look for time after time new performers. <br><br><h5>  Option number one: inexperienced designer. </h5><br><br>  Such, as a rule, are mostly diligent, but the lack of experience initially guarantees a low quality of work.  They are interesting to attract in cases where the project lasts a sufficiently large amount of time, and there is an opportunity to engage in experiments.  The designers themselves, keenly aware of the need for experience and portfolio, call the prices quite low. <br><br>  By the way, the last argument for me personally has long ceased to be decisive, because to save on design is more expensive. <br><br>  For such designers, I can say the following: the development of a portfolio is your main goal, but you don‚Äôt have to be hungry for everything.  The most ideal option for you is the determined customer.  Who clearly knows what she wants.  The most unfavorable - soaring customer.  To whom it is necessary to draw something and what - he does not know.  So if instead of a banal brief you get ‚Äúwell, designer, I want it to be beautiful, and I don‚Äôt know even in what colors,‚Äù it‚Äôs better not to nerve yourself or the customer, and at the same time do not increase the karmic probability of receiving negative feedback. <br><br><h5>  Option number two: a designer with a minimum portfolio </h5><br><br>  As a rule, at this moment euphoria comes from that.  that something is being ordered from me, and not quite adequate behavior begins.  To the credit of the latter, far from all is observed.  It is characterized by a stupor from non-standard situations, unwillingness to finish the work, as well as a passion for large projects.  Which as a rule they cannot digest.  In this situation, only a change of designer helps. <br><br><h5>  Option three: a designer with a good portfolio. </h5><br><br>  Here, in fact, there are two possible scenarios.  Either this is already a sufficiently experienced and adequate person, with whom it is pleasant to do business, but you still need to recognize it as such, or - a creature with a complex of god, who, depending on upbringing, will send you to the forest to one degree or another will require improvements / processing.  And it can get ridiculous - I was once told that if I don‚Äôt like the first version of the site design (the question was about a picture that was beautiful, but didn‚Äôt reflect the required mood on the site and national affiliation), then I MUST provide my own.  Interestingly, the design in this case, I also have to do myself? <br><br><h5>  Option Four: a designer with a huge portfolio </h5><br><br>  Volchara of the design world and Photoshop guru with the beginnings of a telepath.  If you need to do something, and you do not know what and how exactly (option one, in the council), then this is it.  The chance of running into an inadequate is much lower here, but there is still a chance. <br><br><h4>  How to fight </h4><br><br>  As practice has shown, there are several ways to deal with designers :) <br><br>  1. Payment on the fact.  In fact, it discourages many, but a compromise is possible - phased payment, which already suits everyone <br><br>  2. Attentive study of responses and responses to them.  As a rule, on most sites there is an opportunity to comment on a review, and if any behavior that you consider unacceptable remains without a comment explaining the situation, it is better to try to find another artist. <br><br>  3. Continuous evaluation of work.  The most scrupulous item.  If you require the designer to show intermediate results, then kill yourself on the nose - you can not comment on what has not yet been completed.  If an unfinished version was sent to get acquainted with the location of the elements, then do not dare to comment on the background, the appearance of the buttons, their color and so on.  Not for that sent.  It is difficult to overcome yourself, but if you need complete control, you will have to.  Otherwise, the designer is annoyed by the comments of what he most likely sees very well himself. <br><br>  4. If the designer had to change - send to the new applicant the work of the past.  And look what they say.  Start throwing feces - ill-mannered idiot.  He will say that "Nitsche is so" - think about whether he can do something new.  It will correctly indicate deficiencies, and ideally - repeat your thoughts - the ideal candidate.  At the same time, it is important to tell the designer that he has reached the point - this will give him additional information about your desires. <br><br>  5. Brief.  Required item.  A designer can provide it himself, as can you - find a sample and fill it out.  Better, of course, the first option, but the second will go.  Customers, be afraid of designers who rush to work right there, after discussing payment, or who do not know what a brief is.  Designers, do not work without a brief (I speak as an intermediary :)) - in which case there will be nowhere to poke your nose. <br><br>  Another important question is how many options to make.  The fact that the designer does not fall on the first try is 70%.  Even 80%.  Or 90?  Usually I adhere to the following scheme - for a specified amount, 3 fundamentally different design options are made, and one of them is being finalized (no more than 20% of changes).  Be sure to discuss this before starting work. <br><br>  Have a nice day everyone </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137230/</a></p>
