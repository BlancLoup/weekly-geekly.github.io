    <h4>  Unrealized goals. </h4><br>  Have you ever wondered what the global cause of depression and aggression is, which is filled with our world?  Why do some rise to the "Olympus of Fame", while others become outcasts of society?  Some go to the monks, others to crime. <br>  The questions are really not simple and I will not consider all aspects, but will concentrate on the most significant and numerous in my opinion. <br><br><h4>  It will be about their own lack of implementation in life. </h4><br>  Unrealizedness makes people weak, and the older a person becomes, the more often they think about it.  When I was 18, I didn‚Äôt think at all about whether I could make a career by 30, and what was there, I didn‚Äôt understand what profession to choose.  We are let out of school with a certain baggage of generalized knowledge that we do not know how to apply in real life (why is there no ‚ÄúChoice of Profession‚Äù subject in school?).  I chose the faculty in the technical school and the institute as a blind kitten, I kind of liked computers, and at that time I thought that I liked programming, that's why I chose programming as my profession.  To hell!  All this was not mine.  Even though I graduated from the technical school very well and somehow finished the institute that bothered me, I began to realize that I was not doing my own business.  After graduation, I accidentally began to engage in web design, and I realized that this is what I really like, but I could use those 8 years of education in universities to design and it would accelerate my growth. <br><br>  Suppose that my story is average, all the same many by trial and error find their vocation by the age of 25, but there are a considerable number of people wandering through life aimlessly.  They do not find their job, they do not have a hobby, they do not play sports.  According to my observations, if you start to run one sphere of life for nothing, the rest often fall down.  In a life where everything is interconnected, it will not be possible to live only by work or only by family, each of us understands this and is always looking for his own balance. <br><br>  The scheme of personal degradation is as follows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88a/17b/022/88a17b02229eea6c1e1150154a5ec341.jpg"><br><br>  If you go back to the show and, in particular, to the hero Walter White, what happened to him?  He once refused to work in his own company, Gray Matter, and when it soared skyrocketing, it began to put pressure on him, because this was his brainchild, and Walt did not realize himself in the company.  And then lung cancer, which crosses out all his plans.  The genius of this series is how harmoniously shown the transformation of an ordinary school teacher into a hardened unprincipled killer.  The genius in how imperceptibly for many he conveys an important message - realize yourself and your goals now in legal and honest conditions, otherwise the hour will come and you will have to cross the line.  I do not claim that you will go to get a place under the sun with a weapon in your hands, but your lack of fulfillment will to a large extent affect your future life and your environment as a whole. <br>  By default, people who have not realized their potential usually sink to the bottom of the bottle, go into drugs less often, and other social consequences are known (see the diagram above). <br><br>  Realization in life is tightly connected with such notions as responsibility and choice. <br><br><h4>  Responsibility and choice. </h4><br>  Every person on this planet is given the opportunity to take responsibility for their own lives.  Starting from Papua New Guinea and ending with the leaders of states and corporations. <br>  We can all live according to the principle that nobody owes us anything.  When we were ancient hominids, no one was supposed to get food and make clothes, in modern society nothing has changed.  Yes, there were states and governments, wages and taxes, and it really did not change anything, the principle is the same.  Not a single person has yet achieved great heights shouting everywhere that he was not happy with the state, family or grandmother.  Live on your strengths and abilities, do not expect gifts of fate, achieve everything yourself.  Those of my friends and acquaintances who have realized this principle, have ceased to be whiners and make themselves. <br><br>  After taking responsibility comes the choice.  Right now you have chosen to read this article, someone chose to go to a bar or lie on the couch and watch TV.  None of these options is bad or good, it is neutral.  During the day, we make choices a thousand times.  Only each such choice either leads to your goal, either not, or develops, or makes it weaker. <br><br>  Scheme of personal evolution: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69e/d02/d7c/69ed02d7ceff1893fb9102de4e229825.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Ecological development of a person is possible only through responsibility and choice, through small steps every day we are able to approach our image of a successful person.  This is a cyclical work on yourself and your actions.  Full realization never comes, otherwise it would mean the end of development. <br><br>  And here I could finish the article, but I wanted to share with you a tool with which you can achieve your goals in a more organized way, seek support from other people and share your experience. <br><br>  <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress</a> is a platform where anyone can find something of their own.  One will be interested in drawing up your own action plan and constantly posting reports on the work done in the diary, others will like to use the ready-made training template, others will appreciate the various SmartProgress motivational techniques. <br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52b/7d4/88b/52b7d488b26969ab5e60319395742893.jpg" align="left"></a>  In a cozy environment, like-minded people like you, achieving goals will seem like an exciting activity. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/194806/">More about the project</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206398/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206398/</a></p>
