Although manufacturers usually do not declare suction power settings for robotic vacuum cleaners, it is worth noting that the Omega model has every chance of becoming the most efficient and powerful robotic vacuum cleaner.  It uses a new brushless turbo engine with wide blades, which allows to increase the quality of cleaning with a relatively low level of noise (up to 70 dB in Turbo mode).  Brushless motor is very reliable and has a warranty of more than 10 years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/887/b17/689/887b1768970643309506aa0ff43d4c65.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Strengths </h2><br>  When developing a new model, the manufacturer placed the main emphasis on the suction power and minimized the problem of cleaning the main brush of pet hair and long hair.  The first and very important advantage of the Omega model over its competitors is a really high suction power.  To accomplish this task, Yujin Robot engineers used a new brushless turbo engine with high efficiency and doubled the capacity of the Li-Ion battery compared to the previous Arte model (now its capacity is 4400 mAh).  The robot is able to efficiently collect even fine dust, such as sand, from carpets (with a relatively small pile).  According to the results of testing by the manufacturer, Omega is ahead of direct competitors in efficiency up to 20%.

The vacuum cleaner remembers the places where it was already cleaned.  He remembers the location of the base for charging and returns to it by the shortest path.  No matter, 3 or 5 bedroom apartment you have, a vacuum cleaner will independently travel through all available rooms.  If the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room is large enough and the robot can not get out of one charge cycle, it will return to the base, charge and continue cleaning from the same place.  Omega has two such successive cycles.  If you need a more thorough cleaning or a small area, you can use the MAX mode, in which Omega will first travel the entire available area in parallel lines, rotate 90 degrees and continue cleaning in the same places but in the perpendicular direction to the original trajectory.  This is a new double-snake mode, which was not the model Arte. <br><br>  Thanks to the use of a new V6 Blade rubber turbo brush and a high suction power, the vacuum cleaner collects pet hair and pet hair very well.  There is practically no hair, wool or threads left on the main turbo brush.  Everything gets into the dust collector, which is very easy to clean.  The bottom of the vacuum cleaner is also always clean, no rubbing is necessary.  All that needs to be done is to empty the dust collector and the robot is ready to work again.  Behind him requires minimal care.  We will test and verify all this in practice, the test results and the video will be presented later in the article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/654/3df/843/6543df84330f4f228d1857bdbb613e73.jpg"><br><br>  Engineers have installed many new sensors, for example, a pollution sensor and a surface type recognition sensor.  If there is a lot of garbage on the way, Omega turns on the turbo-suction mode in which the suction power and the cleaning efficiency increase.  On carpets, the robot also automatically turns on Turbo mode.  The sensor of availability of the filter will not allow to start the vacuum cleaner without its presence in a dust collector. <br><br><h2>  Design and equipment </h2><br>  The new robot vacuum cleaner is offered in two body colors: iCLEBO Omega Gold (YCR-M07-10) and iCLEBO Omega White (YCR-M07-20).  The plastic case is glossy, but the plastic material is very high quality and its coating does not leave fingerprints on the surface.  The White version of the case looks like white / pearl metallic on cars, that is, it has a certain color depth.  Appearance was designed by the design bureau Innodesign.  The shape of the vacuum cleaner is now not round, special new side brushes and a suitable shape make it even better to clean the corners of the room.  Omega is able to clean corners with an efficiency up to 96%.  The vacuum cleaner has an ultrathin profile with a height of only 87 mm, that is, it will easily drop under the bed, chairs, cabinets and collect dust accumulating there for months. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a29/ee7/187/a29ee7187c4f453e86516907681f6df9.jpg"><br><br>  Included with the robot vacuum cleaner are attached: a base for charging with an external power supply unit, a spare HEPA filter (only in the Russian version of the delivery), a magnetic tape limiter (the length is 1 meter, allows you to limit the cleaning area), the remote control (for setting the time, timer delayed start, control of the robot, return to base, mode selection: forced turbo mode, override threshold mode), remote control batteries, vacuum cleaner brush and, of course, instruction and warranty card in Russian. <br><br>  On the top cover of the case the dust collector compartment is located.  Dust collector has a corrugated HEPA filter.  It is easily cleaned from debris, the filter is mounted on the latch.  The dust collector can be washed with water, but it must be dried well before use so that moisture does not get inside the vacuum cleaner on the motherboard.  Rubber pads are installed between the dust collector and the case, everything is tight enough.  After 2 week samples in the apartment, no accumulations of dust were found in the dust collector compartment, everything was inside it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc5/6d7/9ac/fc56d79aceaa4124ab3ddd7298cc4895.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a40/f78/3f9/a40f783f940d48f48ac848996ff38d06.jpg"><br><br>  Just above is the LCD touch screen.  With it, you can turn on the vacuum cleaner, run into work, select the cleaning mode.  Modes only 3: Auto, Maximum and Local cleaning.  In Auto mode, the vacuum cleaner cleans the apartment in all available places, choosing the most optimal route of movement, remembering the location of the starting point of the start.  As in the Arte model, the technology of visual construction of the room map vSLAM is used.  After returning to the base, the robot discards the card and next time builds it again.  The Omega model has another technology that improves navigation in the apartment - NST (Non Slip Traveling).  The algorithm allows to restore the route line by comparative analysis of the room maps created earlier.  In Maximum mode, the vacuum cleaner removes parallel lines, then perpendicular, and so on until the battery is discharged.  In this mode, he also builds a map of the room.  In Local cleaning mode, the vacuum cleaner cleans in a circle with a diameter of 1 meter, moving in a spiral.  The display shows information on the on / off of the Turbo suction mode, the mode of overcoming thresholds.  If the override mode is disabled, the robot will not be able to overcome the height of 5 mm.  Also, this mode must be used on dark floors.  On top there is a widescreen camera with a viewing angle of 130 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5aa/a54/256/5aaa54256d134910a7156dfee0993619.jpg"><br><br>  The robot has sensors for determining the distance to obstacles on the front bumper: optical PSD sensors and infrared.  The robot takes readings from both types of sensors.  A mechanical touch sensor is also installed on the bumper, but now it is one (unlike the Arte model) and is located only in the center.  The robot determines well the presence of obstacles and rarely physically contacts them.  For additional protection of furniture on the bumper there is a rubber strip that leaves no residue and softens the blow.  The contour of the lower part of the housing allows the vacuum cleaner to overcome thresholds up to 15 mm high.  On the rear surface of the casing there are holes for blowing air. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ff/b06/21d/0ffb0621d7294462940a482cdddf2373.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/607/d0b/394/607d0b394fa84abe8c627655e0b15399.jpg"><br><br>  Turn your attention to the design of the lower part of the Omega.  The first thing that catches your eye is the angled drive wheels.  Yujin Robot decided to use such a constructive solution due to the modified shape of the robot (now it is not round, like the Arte model), and the displacement of wheels farther from the center.  It is with this arrangement of the wheels that the vacuum cleaner can correctly unfold out of the blue.  We asked the manufacturer a question, would it affect the fast tread wear?  We were told that the Omega model has been tested for more than a year in such a form factor, the current applied to the wheels with this arrangement varies only slightly and any wear and tear for a long time will not be noticeable at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c54/393/dbf/c54393dbf0774abf8de873f5a8385ff0.jpg"><br><br>  Another unique difference from other robots on the market is the use of 10 flap side brushes with different villi lengths.  Brushes noticeably tougher than other robots.  In the course of the test, we noted the good efficiency of scavenging small debris (rice, groats), especially on carpets.  Brushes with soft bristles collected garbage worse.  The main brush module has a floating mechanism.  It follows the contour of the floor and fits more closely to its surface.  New rubber turbo brush V6 Blade copes very well with the collection of any debris, including hair.  In rare cases, hair is wound on two central grooves on the brush, as well as on the edges of the brush.  The bearing is hidden in a cylindrical housing, nothing has been wound onto it during all the tests.  It is removed with a little effort, it will be difficult to accidentally lose it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2a/2cc/a48/a2a2cca481f34424a2928c218e5acfa8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e98/8f2/053/e988f205358e485489ecf4775d21ba12.jpg"><br><br>  The front wheel is also hidden under the cover, a magnetic sensor is located on the wheel axis, and an odometer is located in the body of the robot to determine the distance traveled.  The entire structure is designed in such a way that the user makes minimal efforts to clean the robot.  Unfortunately, part of the hair will inevitably be wound on the side brushes and at intervals of 3-4 cleaning will need to be removed for cleaning.  Side brushes can be removed very easily thanks to snap fasteners.  There are no screws or bolts.  You can also attach a microfiber cloth to the bottom, now it is even larger.  The cloth can be moistened in advance before cleaning, but it is necessary to squeeze well to avoid slipping the wheels on a wet and smooth surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55a/16c/1b3/55a16c1b38e34669b0339ab6b75eb4e6.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Robot device </h2><br>  In the lower part of the case are the contact plates of the charger, sensors for determining the level of the floor, an encoder that measures the distance traveled by the front wheel (odometer), and a magnetic tape limiter sensor.  Odometer and magnetic tape sensor work on the principle of the Hall effect.  Let's take a look under the cover of the vacuum cleaner and briefly go over the main blocks.  Dismantling the top cover and front bumper, we get access to the internal filling of the robot.  Immediately you can see the following elements: drive wheels, engine block, battery compartment, touch screen (under which the motherboard is located) and a board with sensors on the front bumper.  In the center is a dust collector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21b/499/85d/21b49985db39401db2c9567e0d0d4291.jpg"><br><br>  Front view resembles an alien saucer disassembled.  It contains PSD and IR distance sensors for objects.  The bumper is mounted in the center on the spring mechanism to the body of the robot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3f/5d4/4ee/d3f5d44ee1d04af9b70643357b950e63.jpg"><br><br>  The unit with the motor is located in the rear of the case.  Under the hood is a brushless motor with relatively wide blades.  Due to this, the vacuum cleaner is noisy quieter than its competitors during cleaning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/539/25a/6ab/53925a6ab10d41dcad267d819e78a276.jpg"><br><br>  Engine manufactured by Delta Electronics.  Characteristics are listed on the back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e6/1c9/f7c/5e61c9f7c7e44869b765da261e548914.jpg"><br><br>  Under the touch screen is the main motherboard, to which the module of the three-axis gyroscope is mounted from below, the connectors for connecting the sensors are connected.  The microcontroller, located on the board, is designed to collect information from all sensors, and control actuators (wheel drives, brushes, etc.).  It is the link between the software located in the navigation module and the hardware of the robot.  The microcontroller provides all the data to the central processor, and executes the control commands received from it.  The central processor is located on the second motherboard under the screen cover next to the camera module.  The navigation module runs on the Linux operating system, contains a video camera and interfaces for communication with all other components of the robot.  The principle of operation is based on the SLAM technology (Simultaneous Location and Mapping) - a simultaneous navigation and mapping method used by the robot to build a map in an unknown space, while simultaneously monitoring the current location and the distance traveled.  The software update connector is brought out into the dustbag compartment, but the vacuum cleaner can only be flashed using a special programmer in the service center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/831/95f/1e7/83195f1e716a4cfb97c928a39c9a67e0.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Comparing iCLEBO Omega with iCLEBO Arte </h2><br><br>  The previous model Arte has been on the Russian market since 2013.  The Omega model was developed from scratch and many components have been improved, but it cannot completely replace the Arte, rather, each robot is suitable for its needs and requirements.  Now we will understand why. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/732/5bc/71b/7325bc71b0844fb7b389ba1333800899.jpg"><br></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/957/3ba/5e1/9573ba5e1f6849a89e97f6633ff6b68d.jpg"><br></td></tr><tr><td>  It can cope with carpets, fine dust and animal hair in a room up to 75 square meters.  m.

As can be seen, in many respects the new Omega model is ahead of Arte, but there are also weaknesses, for example, Arte will be able to work in large rooms with a cleaning area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 300 square meters.  meters, than Omega can not boast.  Arte is quite quiet, you can safely watch TV with a running vacuum cleaner.  Omega is also not very loud in comparison with competitors, but talking on the phone will not be very comfortable.  In general, Arte is an excellent robot, if it is used mainly on smooth floors and with short-haired pets.  Omega, on the contrary, works well on carpets and easily collects the wool of long-haired animals.  Here it should be noted that we are talking about carpets with low pile.  None of the robots on the market will work on carpets with high pile (or it will be useless to slip on it).  There is a younger model in the line - iCLEBO Pop.  It does not have a technology for building a room map, so this model is suitable for small apartments with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 60 square meters.  meters  In such apartments for their 2 hours of operation, a vacuum cleaner with a high degree of probability will be able to remove the entire available area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/344/bbe/d3a/344bbed3a2de4c109b7b72caa089dbaa.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Testing </h2><br>  We conducted several tests on the most important characteristic of the robot vacuum cleaner - the quality of cleaning.  Since iCLEBO Omega has the ability to build a room map, it makes no sense to run over a large area - anyway, it will pass everywhere.  In the future, it will be interesting to compare several TOP robots with the system of building a map of the room, scattering garbage in different rooms on smooth floors and carpets.  In the meantime, we will focus on the quality of cleaning of the model in question on carpets in a limited space.  We also measured the noise level during operation at a distance of about 1 meter.  It did not exceed 66 dB in normal mode and 68 dB in turbo mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a0/6da/164/7a06da164a064bb3915b3987e5d70a2b.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, there are no pets in the test apartment, but there is a woman with hair up to 50 cm long. It is worth noting that almost all the hair falls into the container, but some can still be wound on the edge of the turbo brush and on two grooves in the middle of the brush.  Short hair and wool will fall into the dust collector, they will not have time to wind up due to the high suction flow and the lack of bristles on the turbo brush.  Also, some of the long hair can get on the side brushes and they also need to be cleaned from time to time.  The bottom of the robot is almost perfectly clean, no dust settles on it.  In the tests, we scattered sugar all over the room and measured the efficiency of collecting 100 grams of sugar in one pass of the vacuum cleaner.  Due to the fact that some of the garbage scatters from the impact of the side brushes, the effectiveness in one pass will not reach 100% of the result.  In our test, the vacuum cleaner collected 94% of the sugar in the room in one pass without the flooring module (wet floor cleaning).  Of course, if the garbage will lie directly in the path of its passage, then the efficiency will be almost 100%.  We checked it, both on a small garbage (semolina), and on large (raisins).  On the other hand, the same type of garbage on the carpet does not fly apart from the side brushes and on it iCLEBO showed even the best result due to the high suction power - 95%.  The results of the test on the carpet with different types of cereals are presented in the table: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Type of garbage, surface - carpet </td><td>  Efficiency </td></tr><tr><td>  Pic </td><td>  100% </td></tr><tr><td>  Sugar </td><td>  95% </td></tr><tr><td>  Manka </td><td>  82% </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  As can be seen from the table, the results are very good, considering that we have a full-fledged carpet, and not carpet.  Even such a tiny grits, as semolina, the robot collects very effectively.  We ran the vacuum cleaner in the mode of wet wiping the floor, in a room of 20 square meters.  meters of cloth remained wet throughout the cleaning cycle and behind it was visually noticeable wet trail.  Below is a video with a small overview and tests. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9rqSjQmMs8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjUT_5uquU13EyNbE2IdnKPFBraPw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  The Korean company Yujin Robot in its new product has relied on high suction power and achieved high results of the quality of cleaning.  If the popular iCLEBO Arte model could boast of good maneuverability (overcomes thresholds up to 20 mm), low noise (only 55 dB), a large cleaning area (up to 300 sq. M. In two cycles), then in the Omega model the manufacturer focused on achieving high results when cleaning on carpets and ease of maintenance (almost no hair is wound on the brush).  In any case, the robot vacuum cleaner should be selected exactly for your needs and requirements, taking into account the interior of the room and the conditions of use of the product. <br><br>  UPD.  On the website of the representative of Yujin Robot you can <a href="http://iclebo.com.ru/iclebo_omega">pre-order iCLEBO Omega</a> , the beginning of sales in Russia - the end of September. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396613/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396613/</a></p>
