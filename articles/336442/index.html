  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A sudden desire to become a developer. Personal experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On this cool August morning I drank strong hot tea, trying to finally wake up and start working.  But, as long as the mind resisted the impulse of consciousness, all my activity was reduced to watching the seals and reading all sorts of things on the net.  At some point I ended up on the Toaster.  All the same semi-consciously, I thought that all the time I got there, if I was googling some specific questions, and decided to see how the main page of the site even looked like.  And she looked like this: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A small screenshot, which for aesthetic reasons, I clean under spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bef/b77/d85/befb77d85138a13638885817445f877b.png" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  See a couple of similar questions next?  So my mind opened one eye and said - "Hmm ... Familiar topic, bro."  Trying not to think what the eyes of the mind look like, I read these questions, comments to them, and I had an overwhelming desire to share my story with the community.  History under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For starters, you should explain the reasons for writing a post.  The topic of changing a profession is relevant for many - changes in the labor market, a boring routine, a desire to try yourself in something new, a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581_%25D1%2581%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">midlife crisis</a> . <br><br>  I have this process now in full swing, and it is going, maybe, not as stable as we would like, but on the whole it is positive.  And in the topics on the Toaster, the mood of the top-starters was very pessimistic, so I want to say to such people - believe in yourself, try, and everything will work out for you.  But this is somehow routine, so I decided to share my experience, which, I hope, will be able to at least motivate someone.

      The reasons explained.  Now I will try to state my biography - a piece that is slightly chaotic, I will try to note only moments that relate to the subject, without details. <br><br><h2>  Live and learn </h2><br>  School.  Now my school is called a ‚Äúgymnasium‚Äù, and when I was studying it was just a good school with literate teachers.  Is that English from the 1st grade, and German / French (optional) from the 5th to the 9th.  From about the 5th grade I went to classes in the ‚Äúcomputer club‚Äù a couple of times a week.  There, my friends and I began to comprehend computer science (or play when the teacher gave the task and went somewhere).  We started with an acquaintance with MS-DOS on the 286th (the arkanoid is my 1st computer game), then NC and text editors on the 386th (Grand Prix Formula 1 - I write these lines and I think - ‚Äúplay it‚Äù), and then , already on the Pentium I under Win95, was BASIC (UFO, HOMM2, and for trying to play the good old Carmageddon with children, he received a hat from his wife last year). <br><br>  I know that I promised without details, but this nostalgia is stronger than me.  Sorry, I will no longer. <br><br>  After school I entered a local university.  The budget, the faculty of IT, but the points were enough to pass on the specialty with the laconic name "Mathematics".  In the schedule of 5 types of mathematics per week, IT is only in perspective, two courses, and strange teachers, half of which, instead of lectures, tell some stories or talk about politics / world order / anything else-except-subject.  I did not even live to see the end of the 1st year, I just stopped going there. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt want to get into the army, somehow I enrolled in a college at the ‚ÄúPO and VT‚Äù department.  Again by - I would need software, but because of the many nuances it turned out only on BT.  At that time I was not very interested in messing around with iron.  I studied a year and a half, took the documents. <br>  Again the same old university, specialty - management.  Better than in the army - as I thought then. <br><br><h2>  You do not work - there is nothing to live on.  Work - live once (taken from the depths of the network) </h2><br>  In parallel with the attempt to get some kind of education, life was like this - after school I move out from my parents, I live with a girl.  I work as a maintenance worker at a construction site, then in a pair of books (this is like with Chinese irons, people go to apartments, only books and offices mostly).  It lasted about 3 months, as soon as I turned 18, I go to work at the factory on the night shift.  A couple of months in students and 1st specialty - "balancer of components and parts."  Then there was the experience of working as a ‚Äúflatbed printer‚Äù.  The same scheme - training, exam, discharge.  The experience is very interesting, but because of the aggressive environment (a pair of paint, solvent, etc.), there was constant irritation of the nasal mucosa.  I decided not to risk it and quit. <br><br>  He settled into the salon of cellular communication sold.  The enthusiasm for the IT sector has already been greatly diminished.  Well, so - an advanced user with useless knowledge of BASIC and a little bit of Delphi.  Interests - family (daughter was born), work, a little bit of study (studying management was boring).  Computer used for movies and games. <br><br>  Pretty quickly becoming the highest selling point.  But, over time, the work starts to bother.  It brings money at the level of average salary in the city, there is nothing new, there are no prospects.  I move to the small office for the same salary as a fitter - subcontracts for laying Rostelecom Vituha to the subscriber.  I am glad to rest - after working with my head, such work with hands brings pleasure.  But with the university again did not work out, expelled for non-attendance.  Hit the army, and funny.  According to the registration, there was a summons, but some kind person advised - go to the military registration and enlistment office, now bust and do not take children with children, but you will not look like a draft deviator.  The draft board had a different opinion.  As a result, he served as a signalman, the whole year was laid on the part of the telephone lines and security. <br><br>  After the army - first a couple of months involved in the installation of the OPS (one-time object).  Then he settled on the installation of video surveillance.  At some point, the office (very small) was bad with orders.  The director suggested an option - he is looking for customers, I make schemes, calculations, equipment selection, and if I roll, I go with installers, I install and configure it myself.  It was interesting, but when the director began to redraw my calculations and, instead of the normal equipment and materials promised to the customer, to buy the cheapest possible analogs, I decided to shift it. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Opened the company, closed the company</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> At first, for some time, I simply edited at the request of old customers or helped colleagues from other offices.  But, as is often the case, it quickly became necessary to arrange everything officially and with papers, so I opened an LLC.  I'm alone in the lineup.  The founder, director, chief accountant, manager, engineer, <s>man and ship</s> .  The numbers in the phone are a few checked hands (and a pair of young, but cheap) installers-freelancers.  These are fighters for laying cable and installing iron.  I set it up myself, except for very simple objects.  Goal to make a lot of money was not.  I wanted no one to interfere with the implementation of projects as I had intended them.  I tried to look for some interesting technical problems.  But they were few, most were intercepted by more reputable firms.  In the system of public procurement and kickbacks, I did not climb.  Conscience does not allow.  Plus, interaction with customers and suppliers took a lot of time and nerves.  Because of the heap of responsibilities taken on, children (at that time already 2 daughters) saw only sleeping.  When there was time for rest, either to go fishing or to play tanks, I just wanted to sit somewhere and nobody would touch me.  I realized that I was falling into depression and apathy.  I had enough for 3 years, after which I spat. <br></div></div><br>  I remembered that I once wanted to become a programmer.  I was interested.  And now I'm 30, I have a diverse experience, only knowledge is often superficial.  Then he drove this anguish, pissed off all the better.  Discarded excessive self-criticism.  I remembered how I set up MikroTik routers on objects, then I had to write some of my scripts, and what a thrill I felt when they started working as it should.  Download a Java tutorial, and ... <br><br><h2>  Hello, my name is userName, and I'm an <s>alcoholic</s> novice developer </h2><br>  Naturally, I wanted to start doing something useful as soon as possible.  The first step is to register on the Russian freelance exchanges and try to find any order I can make.  Scope - writing parsers for sites.  Because it is simple and there is demand.  Faced with the fact that almost all such resources for communication with the customer asked for a paid account.  Although there are ridiculous rates, about 1000r / month, but somehow there was no desire to immediately pay for anything.  Probably, professional deformation - I used to, that first I do the work, then I get paid for it.  And then they immediately ask me for money.  No, guys, I do not want.  But with one person through this site all the same out.  I needed a parser for the catalog of one online store. <br><br>  Talked, began to do.  With a creak, but it seemed to work out.  Threw off the preliminary version.  Another week 2 was sluggish correspondence, after which the person disappeared.  I do not even know what it was - an attempt to throw?  For the sake of a small gain, get a utility curve?  But I was already too lazy to try to contact this character - I got a long-awaited practical experience, tried a couple of different approaches, and in general I was pleased with myself.  A small digression - I really do not like to solve some theoretical problem.  I need something that can be used for some practical purpose.  At the same time their ideas are not very much. <br><br>  In the process of searching for orders at domestic sites, I realized that there is still a drawback, besides paid accounts, project budgets.  Minus is largely subjective, but is related to the topic.  At the age of 20, I wouldn‚Äôt steal and calmly take on small, simple orders with a modest budget.  Now I look at it and think - is it worth it to move for such money at all?  To spend the same time on further study will be more profitable.  On the other hand, even a small completed order is a +1 satisfied customer.  But I figured out how to resolve this dilemma. <br><br>  By this time, I already had profiles on a couple of international sites. <br><br>  At this point I would like to summarize a little. <br><br>  The attentive reader probably noticed that I have some sort of frustration every now and then (or the routine is just annoying) - and I start doing something new.  At the same time, I am not the organizer of innovative startups.  All that I do is largely banal things that do not require any titanic efforts and academic knowledge.  For some reason, I‚Äôm sure that many of those who would like to try their hand at IT, but are afraid that it is too late - will still be more responsible and assiduous guys than me. <br><br>  Keep your self-criticism and insecurity in your hands.  At least sometimes.  During my life I have already seen a lot of people in different industries, whose skills leave much to be desired.  But they do not worry about it and work on the work, sometimes according to the principle ‚Äúit will come down like that.‚Äù  You are already more responsible than them.  It will take not so much time to pump professional skills to their level. <br><br>  Farther.  Training - information is the sea, there are all kinds of courses, you can do it yourself.  There are many opportunities, you just need to start. <br><br>  Age.  No need to keep yourself in the framework of some generally accepted patterns.  At what age to get an education, get married, have children, buy real estate.  It is most effective when you want it.  By the way, your personal qualities and life experience will play into your hands.  It is unlikely that it would occur to you to go to work in Europe on a tourist visa.  If there is interest and desire - everything will turn out. <br><br>  In general, these tips are not just about IT and development.  Therefore, I will add another small nuance.  The difference between my attempts at programming is about 15 years.  With modern IDEs, a zoo of libraries, a bunch of subject forums and resources - performing tasks that will provide you with an adequate level of income is not as difficult as it seems. <br><br>  Perhaps that's all.  Thank you for your time.  If you are interested in what happened next - write in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336442/</a></p>
