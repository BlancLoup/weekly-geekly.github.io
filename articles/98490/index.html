Meanwhile, in the scientific research institute of television, constant broadcasting in such a format is called a dangerous experiment that can lead to massive disorders of health and psyche.  Experiments with 3D-broadcasting must necessarily be carried out under public control, with restrictions on the age of the audience, on the viewing time and the plot content of 3D-programs, experts at the relevant research institute say. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It turns out that developments in the field of stereoscopic television were still in the Soviet Union, and the technology of surround broadcasting was first introduced in our country by Professor Shmakov in 1959, but they were used only for professional purposes.  In particular, for controlling robotic manipulators, when examining the accident site of the Kursk nuclear submarine. <br>  According to the chief researcher of the Research Institute of Television, Lev Polosin, experts express fears that the likelihood of the negative impact of 3D broadcast on the viewer is high.  And for public broadcasting experts of the Scientific Research Institute of 3D have never recommended or recommended. <br><br>  The fact is that the feature of perception of stereoscopic images leads to an additional load of the cerebral cortex, which is why people with an unbalanced psyche can develop disorders and aggravate diseases. <br><br>  This is not the first time that experts warn about the dangers of 3D health.  At the beginning of the year, at the peak of the popularity of the Avatar 3D movie, one of the employees of the Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery proposed that stereo film distributors be warned viewers about a possible negative impact on human health.  And recently, the negative impact of 3d-films on the eyes was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/3d/90182/">written</a> on Habr√©.

      As it turned out, 3D-films are the most dangerous for people suffering from osteochondrosis and osteoarthrosis.  The visual cortex of the human brain is activated when viewing stereo films, but for these diseases, the blood flow in the visual cortex may be insufficient, which leads to strokes.  There have been several publications on this topic in the scientific community. <br><br>  In the spring, Samsung - the world's largest manufacturer of 3D-TVs - was forced to limit the potential audience of its products.  For each such TV is now attached an official warning about the increased risk of 3D for children, pregnant women, the elderly, alcoholics and those who suffer from insomnia. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/561/f23/57e/561f2357e03a52d5175b14bf390a15e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Experts from the Research Institute of Television are confident that the introduction of stereo broadcasting should be done with extreme caution and with restrictions, especially in relation to children and adolescents.  Looking for restrictions on age, viewing time and plot.  Care must be taken to ensure that the effect is not prolonged, since 3D causes an increased activity of the cerebral cortex. <br><br>  Lev Polosin also believes that film makers, as they master the technology, will try to use it in such a way as to hit, shock the viewer, and affect the psyche even more.  This can be extremely dangerous, so the restrictions on the plot are necessary.  As an example, Japan is cited, where mass mental disorders in children were previously observed when watching some cartoons on ordinary TV.  And the influence of 3D-technology is still not well understood, and may pose a great danger. <br><br>  In the meantime, 3D technologies are already sweeping the world.  This year the first in the world live broadcast of the ballet in 3D format <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/91592/">was performed</a> in Russia.  The FIFA World Cup is already broadcast in three dimensions.  Japan, as always ahead of the rest.  In 2022, they are going to take over the world championship in football and broadcast it in a holographic 3D format.  So the arrival of the volumetric image on the mass screens is inevitable.  It is only a matter of time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98490/</a></p>
