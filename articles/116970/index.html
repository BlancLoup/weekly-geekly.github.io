Grandparent strategies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a5606745/6082184c/66903bbf/e73b9859.jpg">  Few people know that most turn-based strategies owe their appearance to the game created 25 years ago on the Commodore Amiga. <br><br>  It was the game "Defender of the Crown" - the first turn-based strategy with RPG elements.  In 1987, it was ported to most platforms.  I first saw her on the ZX Spectrum and at school made a remake for the PC.  As it turned out, it was already done a long time ago, even for CGA monitors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/990f566b/621b70e5/cd33820c/7d814325.jpeg">  The essence of the game is to unite the kingdom fragmented after the death of King Richard, playing for one of the Saxon leaders - Ivanhoe, Cedric from Rotherwood, Wolfric Wild, or Jeffrey Lonsvord. <br><br>  There were few available actions: arrange a knight tournament, raid the neighboring castle, buy / seize the neighboring lands / castle, or buy an army.  For the attack on the castle necessarily needed catapults.

It was possible to install locks on the lands in order to complicate the seizure of territories and to improve the defense. <br><br>  As far as I remember, 5 opponents participated in the game at the same time, including you. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f94de95f/85e54cad/ab1ca361/8f45af8b.png">  <b>There were several "chips":</b> <br><ul><li>  You could also request help from Robin Hood, who during the game makes terror on the lands of the Norman barons and replenishes your treasury. </li><li>  During the game you are offered to save one of the beautiful ladies from prison, if successful, the castle and the lands of the baron will be given to you as a dowry. </li><li>  At the tournament on some platforms you could kill your opponent, as a result of which his lands became neutral, and you were forever forbidden to participate in tournaments. </li><li>  The Normans could also perform the same actions as you - to invite to the tournament, rob your castle. </li></ul><br>  As a result of these actions, your skills ‚Äî sword, spear, and strategic skills ‚Äî improved or deteriorated, which affected future victories. <br><br>  The game ended after you became the master of all counties (there were 18 of them). <br><br>  For 1986, it was a breakthrough. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c27da587/b1b8d62f/f9188386/9da8261b.jpg">  In the aftermath, there were a lot of remakes.  I played almost everything.  The only worthy in which the gameplay was improved, the graphics, archers were added and the story in which the range of characters was expanded was slightly changed - you play for both Ivanhoe and Robin, and you can give orders to Lady Mary and Father Tuku.  What is especially nice is that in this game King Richard is "resurrected". <br><br>  This game has received a new name "Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown".  I recommend to everyone who remembers the first Defender. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116970/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116970/</a></p>
