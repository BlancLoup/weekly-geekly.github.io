  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Story about the first RDSFront & Meetup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  Until recently, inside our company, meetings were held under the name of RamblerJS.  The developers prepared reports on topics they were interested in and told in our lecture hall to all the front-tenders (and not only) of the group of companies.  Usually this was accompanied by pizza or fruit and a little discussion after.  This time, everything went a little differently, which will be discussed in the post on behalf of one of the organizers. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89c/5ee/69b/89c5ee69bd4c4e118369ee88b6aa01cb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On Wednesday, December 14, we conducted a pilot <b>RDSFront &amp; Meetup</b> , which was originally conceived as a regular meeting within the company.  But in the course of its preparation, everything changed: from the list of reports to the name of the event.

    <h3>  At first one performance was planned. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0f/1e1/480/c0f1e148095f44a5b93ab57ed83e1931.png" width="40%" alt="image" align="left">  This was a report on optimizing the loading of web pages.  We thought about this a long time ago, since there was no pronounced culture of optimization of the frontend inside the holding, and the amount of functionality on the client grew. <br><br>  Then one day a Project Manager said: ‚ÄúI'm tired of the project being loaded slowly!  Let's optimize!  This phrase resulted in research and optimization of one of the projects.  And so usually the contented manager, after seeing the results, broke into an even bigger smile. <br><br>  Then, whether by chance, or on enthusiasm, the developer from another project became interested in the topic.  He investigated not only his own, but also the projects of the entire holding and made conclusions.  This all resulted in the topic of the report, which no one usually touched on here. <br><br><h3>  Another report to the program </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/016/0bd/ae8/0160bdae873f46638f87817fd64aa241.png" alt="image" align="right" width="40%">  One day, a man came from R &amp; D with the words: "I did it and I want to show it."  This tool is called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rship">rship</a> .  He has already spoken and more than once, so all we needed was to ask him to come to the performance run one day. <br><br>  Also, in the course of preparation, another report on the component approach was added, but the proposal to participate in the mitap was a surprise for the author, and as a result, it was decided to postpone his report to the next mitap. <br><br><h3>  How the internal event became external </h3><br>  After some time, we realized that interesting reports were being heaped up.  Since the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãexpanding had long been in the air, it was decided to invite external guests, to which everyone reacted positively.  But if everything goes wrong, we did not want this to reflect on a large number of people, and began to think how to make sure that the right number of guests arrived. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de2/d7c/800/de2d7c80038d4788b0fc3a99f0adf13f.png" alt="image" align="left" width="30%">  For a start, it was decided that if twenty outside guests would come, then this would be ideal for a start.  Long pulled and eventually created an event on Friday on the <a href="https://rambler-co-e-org.timepad.ru/event/419923/">timepad</a> , and on Monday, before the event, wrote <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/rambler-co/blog/317412/">an article on Habr√©</a> .  Total: about forty registrations and about twenty came to the event.  Plus, interested employees of our company, in the end came about seventy. <br><br>  Along the way, we came up with another name, under which we can combine our other events: RDSFront &amp;.  So RamblerJS became RDSFront &amp; Meetup, part of RDSFront &amp; Community <br><br><h3>  Not only pizza is needed </h3><br>  The day before the event, I realized that I needed something special, which I myself would have liked, because there were already an insane amount of pizza in the week.  And this something turned out to be gingerbread from the store of Swedish products IKEA!  I love them with coffee! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/788/0ab/f3e/7880abf3ebee4db5823896e3f23b9dc6.jpg" alt="image" align="right" width="30%">  In the morning I asked to organize two coffee machines, so that all would be enough, in the end, of the five boxes it took almost four.  The remaining cookies in the fourth box were eaten the next day by our team. <br><br>  Before the event, they launched a video series with a new logo to the soundcloud music that created a relaxed atmosphere and the evening went well! <br><br><h3>  In the final </h3><br>  Of course, I was worried and when presenting our event to the guests, I said a couple of times not what was needed.  Of course, I would be happy if more guests came.  And, of course, it was possible to work on the performances.  But as for me, everything went well for the first time, and next time it will only be better! <br><br><h3>  Future plans </h3><br><ul><li>  Collect feedback and consider comments before the next event. </li><li>  Make the event more friendly to our guests. </li><li>  Finish the logo because: ‚ÄúThe silhouettes of people look like an attack of clones, you need to make each one unique.  For example, finish the beard! ‚Äù </li><li>  Launch your own website with announcements of events, videos and photographic materials. </li></ul><br>  Thanks to everyone who helped and everyone who came! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Add.
