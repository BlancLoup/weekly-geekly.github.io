I want to present you a small report for September. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Sergey Chikuyonok </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f72/1a5/e60/f721a5e60b8498fbbb45e17cb9e5f9b3.jpg" alt="Sergey Chikuyonok" align="left">  Most recently, we held a conference with Sergey Chikuyenkom ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/interviews/68438/">announcement</a> ) - technical consultant of Art. Lebedev Studio.  There were many interesting questions to which Sergey gave detailed answers.  Here are some of them: <br><br>  <i>Evgeny Nasyrov</i> : Hello, Sergey!  Tell us about the most interesting project in which you participated. <br>  <i>Sergey Chikuyonok</i> : My most interesting and favorite project is Paritet98.  I remember it not so much by the abundance of different animations for one page (some of which, unfortunately, did not appear on the site), as by its concept: the site in one line.  This was the main difficulty - it was necessary to insert blocks into the text line, and even move them smoothly ... ( <a href="http://conf.404fest.ru/conference/conf-64/">read all</a> )

      <i>Inko</i> : Some call for helping people get rid of IE6 (by upgrading to something new) by showing a line with the call and links at the top of the page (for example, <a href="http://ie6update.com/">ie6update.com</a> ).  Sergey, your attitude to such initiatives?  Should I put on the site, or is it nonsense :-)? <br>  <i>Sergey Chikuyonok</i> : I have nothing against this line - the method is good and correct, you only need to show this bar no more than 3 times per session, so that it does not bother you.  The main thing is that the site works fine in IE6.  Let without any frills and beauty, but the main functionality and content should be available.  What I'm really up against is ... ( <a href="http://conf.404fest.ru/conference/conf-64/">read all</a> ) <br><br>  <i>Valdemar Mozhaikin</i> : Sergey, is HTML5 website creation justified now?  Or is it worth waiting for old browsers to be ousted from the market, and will only support this technology? <br>  <i>Sergey Chikuyonok</i> : I don‚Äôt see any reason to write &lt;footer&gt; instead of &lt;div id = "footer"&gt;, especially since it can still be changed 10 times. <br><br>  <i>Leonid Nazarov</i> : What do you need (or vice versa do not need) to do to the designer so that the layout designer can make the layout qualitatively?  What files, descriptions need to be attached? <br>  <i>Sergey Chikuyonok</i> : for designers I can give the following tips: <br>  1. Make a 1000 pixels wide layout, then it will be easier to calculate percentages for stretching sites. <br>  2. Split the entire layout into columns of equal width, align the page elements according to them.  It is desirable that the number of columns should divide 100 without remainder (for example, 2, 4, 5, 10) - then it will be possible to easily align the elements in different blocks on the grid (for example, align the image in the content with the logo in the header), but this already depends from coder skills.  I will write an article on the layout of multicolumn sites.  ( <a href="http://conf.404fest.ru/conference/conf-64/">6 more tips</a> ) <br><br>  Most of the answers are very voluminous, so I had to crack them.  Read the entire conference <a href="http://conf.404fest.ru/conference/conf-64/">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  Damir Khalilov </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/adc/1aa/d29/adc1aad29206a5d8f584b3bb0a6e3f2d.jpg" alt="Damir Khalilov" align="left">  Following Sergey, Damir Khalilov, General Director of the GreenPR agency, spoke in the role of speaker.  Damir answered questions about social media marketing and creating a personal brand on the Internet: <br><br>  <i>Dmitry Zvyagin</i> : What can be the reason for the low popularity of Twitter in Russia compared to other countries and why? <br>  <i>Damir Khalilov</i> : I think that everything is just beginning here.  The crazy growth rates of Russian Twi in recent months confirm this.  Of course, ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù Twitter is unlikely to overtake, but to compete with LJ and LI it will be quite capable. <br><br>  <i>Stas Gladkov</i> : Hi Damir!  Tell me, how effective are your contests as a tool for social media marketing?  What points do you recommend to pay attention to when creating contests?  How to give a competition a viral character?  How to get traffic from the competition?  What examples of successful contests could you bring?  thank <br>  <i>Damir Khalilov</i> : Contests, flash mobs, interactive promotions are a very effective SMM tool.  As a rule, users with great interest refer to this kind of interaction, since the game mechanism is activated, this is the same game marketing that Anton Popov writes about. <br>  When creating contests, I recommend paying the most attention to ... ( <a href="http://conf.404fest.ru/conference/conf-65/">read in full</a> ) <br><br>  <i>Dmitry Zvyagin</i> : Is it possible to use Twitter to get some income in monetary terms?  If so, why is it now that no one uses it? <br>  <i>Damir Khalilov</i> : Really.  There are three main earning options: <br>  1. To promote the services of your company or your own services through Twi.  I think everything is clear here - the main thing is the ability to monetize fame. <br>  2. Sell something through Twi.  This may be your product or product partners ...
