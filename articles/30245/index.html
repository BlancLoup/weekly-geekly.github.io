      Le courage in French means "courage."  After all, only a brave person living on a flat world is able to collect the necessary ingredients for making the perfect beer, overcoming all the difficulties on his way - in short, you can retell the beginning of this quest, the second of the promo series of Stella Artois beer.  But if the first game - ‚Äú <a href="http://www.stellaartois.com/index.php">Stranger</a> ‚Äù - was simpler both in plot and in execution, then ‚ÄúCourage‚Äù turned out to be a head taller than its predecessor on several points at once. <br><br>  First of all, an <strong>interesting plot</strong> - the fact that the game takes place in 1366 on a flat world full of mysteries and dangers, is of interest to what all this will end.  Yes, and the tasks themselves are interesting, each of which gives flat-cut brewers another important component of Stella Artois beer.  An important role in the game was played by the use of <strong>video</strong> - live actors are involved in ‚ÄúCourage‚Äù, for which, which is especially noteworthy, they sewed the respective costumes and supplied them with the necessary equipment.  The video fits perfectly into <strong>animated drawn backgrounds</strong> - everything looks amazingly beautiful.  Special thanks to the developers for the Russian and Ukrainian <strong>localization of</strong> toys - although the voice-over says in English, the subtitles make it possible to understand everything that is said between tasks. <br><br><br>  <strong>‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.gettheglass.com/">Get the Glass</a></strong> , or Milk heist :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/ada/a66/957/adaa66957b4ff5463e438966e3c0e424.jpg" width="250" height="200" vspace="10"><br><br>  This is simply a stunning project by the Swedish studio North Kingdom for the brand ‚ÄúGot milk?‚Äù (California Milk Processor Board), whose work, as I understand it, should bring to the market an association of 11 California dairy plants <font color="#888888">(if anyone knows anything more about this brand, write in the comments, please)</font> . <br><br>  <strong>The essence of the game</strong> is to help the Adachi family to get to the impregnable Fort Fridzh, which houses the Glass of Milk, which is so useful for both children and adults.  At the same time, a police car is chasing the four of the new criminals.  And whoever gets to the goal first will be decided by the dice, which Adachi (well, that is, you) and the cops throw out alternately.  During the entire game you will not only get to the fort in time with the desired milk, but also complete <strong>four rather difficult quests</strong> - each for a family member.  If you don‚Äôt, then welcome to Milkatras, the most severe prison in the local ocean waters.  The whole game is interspersed with <strong>video inserts</strong> , which, together with the gameplay, create a sense of <strong>an interactive 3D cartoon</strong> , which is also very soundly <strong>voiced</strong> . <br><br>  By the way, the <strong>graphics</strong> in the game is gorgeous.  In order to get a detailed model of the island on which the Adachi family lives, the developers had to create a real model of it, then reproducing it on a computer - look at the <a href="http://www.h4che.com/milk">history of the creation of the game</a> in pictures, it is really interesting. <br><br><br>  <strong>‚Ä¢ <a href="http://dark.room.fizzlebot.com/">Dark Room</a></strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/fb6/8d4/f9e/fb68d4f9eb8482c16a29d8e8fc0c1dc4.jpg" width="250" height="200" vspace="10"><br><br>  Although the ‚ÄúDark Room‚Äù is already years old and many people know this puzzle, it‚Äôs impossible not to mention it.  First of all, the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a game is quite original - you need to solve seven different puzzles, rotating the same cube in order to ‚Äúrun from the dark room‚Äù.  But even to get to one of the seven levels, you also need to think a little about brains.  The dark atmosphere in the game is built not only by the dark gamma used, but also by the sounds - associations with the movie ‚ÄúCube‚Äù involuntarily arise, although there are no traps in the Dark Room.  The game is very sketchy, which, however, does not prevent it from remaining interesting even now, when even Flash capabilities are far ahead. <br><br><br>  <strong>‚Ä¢</strong> Actually, <strong><a href="http://amanita-design.net/samorost-1">Samorost</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://amanita-design.net/samorost-2">Samorost 2</a></strong> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/250/380/148/250380148d29288dc049416d082ced86.jpg" width="250" height="200" vspace="10" align="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/5ad/45e/1aa/5ad45e1aa8894fc71e72807aeab89419.jpg" width="250" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  As mentioned earlier, very atmospheric, beautiful and glorious quests about the adventures of a little gnome living in the depths of space on his little snag-like planet.  In the first part of the game you need to prevent another planet from colliding with the world of the main character.  In the second, to save the Bobik stolen by green aliens from a dwarf and safely return home. <br><br>  There are probably three strengths to games.  Firstly, the <strong>plot</strong> - although unpretentious, but very nicely beaten.  It is not boring to perform simple puzzles, although in some places you have to strain your brains a little.  Secondly, the <strong>graphics</strong> , which in ‚ÄúSamorostah‚Äù is worthy of special praise.  Mossy bark, mosses, lichens, rusty pieces of iron - macro photographs of all these objects are very coolly processed, making up surreal backgrounds.  Animated objects and characters, on the contrary, are drawn simply, but the fantasy of the developer who populated these fantastic worlds with amazing creatures is pleasing.  <strong>Sounds</strong> and <strong>background music</strong> are the third advantage of games :) But if the first ‚ÄúSamorost‚Äù samples were cut from the works of other musicians, the soundtrack Samorost 2 is completely original (and is available in <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum%3Fid%3D160466177%26s%3D143441">the iTunes store</a> , for example). <br><br><br>  <strong>‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.robobrawl.com/">RoboBrawl</a></strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/669/ea7/947/669ea79475670337f0b57ac11df583b6.jpg" width="250" height="200" vspace="10"><br><br>  Robot fights created by <a href="http://www.ff0000.com/">Red Interactive agency</a> in support of the new Intel Xeon processor at that time.  Before the start of the competition, you need to assemble your ‚Äúfighter‚Äù - put up a defense, equip a weapon, choose a method of movement.  When everything is ready, you can enter the arena to fight five opponents in an unequal battle and earn points that can be spent on upgrading your robot. <br><br>  Everything is very well done - and the <strong>pseudo-three-dimensional picture</strong> , and <strong>sound</strong> , and <strong>control</strong> , and the <strong>drawing of the robots themselves</strong> .  Even the fact that you can enter the game as a nameless guest is also a plus.  Every detail of the robot has its own power consumption, and the total limitation of the robot in terms of battery consumption will force the player to seek a compromise between weapon power, armor reliability and movement speed.  Points for winning allow you to get a bonus for the effectiveness of the weapon, the durability of the robot and its ability to ‚Äúadapt to the changed conditions‚Äù (did not catch what it really means in the game).  So I strongly advise you to try RoboBrawl if you are a fan of ‚Äúcasual arcades‚Äù :) <br><br>  <strong>‚Ä¢ <a href="http://attiknoise.com/littledeviant">Book of Deviants</a></strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/2c8/fbe/56a/2c8fbe56af3d659d70f69b6cc671c69c.jpg" width="250" height="200" vspace="10"><br>  <font color="#888888">Thanks for the link habracheloveku <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/pdmitriy/" class="user_link">PDmitriy</a> :)</font> <br><br>  "The Book of the Nuts" - this name for the game was chosen for a reason.  The game really takes place on the pages of a strange book that tells about demons collecting blood in general, quiet and peaceful sheep people, to use it with good intentions - to launch a new production line of cars Scion xD.  <a href="http://www.scion.com/">Scion</a> - a division of Toyota - surprised many with such a promo game, in which you need to kill all the "sheep" that come across from the player on the way. <br><br>  But despite the cruelty of this mixture of quest and arcade, it is necessary to recognize that the developers of Book of Deviants did a great job.  Here are high-quality <strong>video sequences</strong> and <strong>control methods</strong> that differ from chapter to chapter (the whole book is divided into seven chapter-levels).  The voice-over is accompanied by <strong>subtitles</strong> - useful for those who do not catch the spoken language very well by ear (with localization, alas, it did not work out).  Everything is done in a stylish, tasteful and ... wisely way - only for one green blood, thanks, for with the reds from the toy it would have turned out a real gloom. <br><br>  <strong>‚Ä¢ <a href="http://scion.gamesradar.com/">Scion Street Racing</a></strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45b/198/250/45b198250b0f5586699ce1cb892e8de4.jpg" width="250" height="200" vspace="10"><br><br>  Scion's next promo game is top street racing.  The player chooses one of the models of 2008 - xB, tC and xD - color, wheels, body kits (if provided for the selected model) and "fantasy" decor (probably, "stupid for fun").  After this, the race starts - you need to look at the map in order not to stray from the route, and go around obstacles - houses, trees, parked cars and pedestrians.  For each visit to the listed objects, the chronometer throws a second.  Although if you ram a car several times, it will explode, freeing the way. <br><br>  You should be careful when cornering, as there usually the game throws up standing cars and pours puddles on which you can lose control for a moment, which is quite enough to go astray.  <strong>The graphics are</strong> quite at the level, although compared to the Book of the Freaks, it does not shine with originality.  <strong>The sound is</strong> also quite good, and you can choose <strong>background music</strong> from the proposed playlist.  The only thing to get used to <strong>management</strong> is to look at the top without the proper skill, it‚Äôs not easy to navigate to which keys to press so as not to slant into another tree. <br><br>  An additional "trick" of the game is <strong>dynamically composable maps of the city</strong> and <strong>unkillable pedestrians</strong> (probably after the "Book" tortured my conscience :)) But your car is "mortal" - a couple of dozen hits on obstacles and ... yeah. <br><br><br>  And who can advise other toys?  Comments are welcome, folders with bookmarks are opened wider :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30245/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30245/</a></p>
