  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3 years of online counseling - how is it?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Being engaged in the <a href="http://webim.ru/">Web Messenger</a> project (software for organizing online consulting on the site) for 3 years we have accumulated more than extensive experience in online consulting of visitors to our site, besides that we always try to keep up to date with our customers using our system, so we wanted to discuss accumulated with a respected audience: <a name="habracut"></a><ol><li>  <b>It is important to really want to help the client</b> in solving his tasks, not just sell the product, or help choose the version, but really get into the essence of how and why the client wants to use the system, what tasks he wants to solve for himself, everything else, anyway, derives from this.  As you know, " <i>The meaning of activity lies outside the activity itself</i> ." </li><li>  <b>We want to help, and not just give information -</b> no need to unnecessarily send a visitor back to the site, the visitor has already turned to the consultant because he didn‚Äôt find something on the site and once he turned - you need to clarify how that is.  Links are given only for the future or if the information is not transmitted via chat. <br></li><li>  <b>A consultant is not obliged to know absolutely everything</b> - sometimes there are questions that require thinking or remembering something, so it‚Äôs okay to ask the visitor for contacts and contact him a little later.  The main thing is to properly understand the client‚Äôs question :) Another option is to invite the visitor to talk with another consultant and translate it.  In no case do not just need to ask to contact later without taking the coordinates. </li><li>  <b>No need to use template answers, it is better to learn how to type blindly</b> - imagine that you are talking on the phone and a person is reading something on the book, it is always audible.  Always negatively perceived pattern phrases when a girl calls you and offers some services.  Who among us has not heard the deliberate "thanks for your time"?  Of the templates, we allow ourselves only a greeting, it is more necessary because  The percentage of refusals (when the visitor closes the window without saying anything) is tangible and we, alas, cannot physically greet every visitor. </li><li>  <b>Only the visitor can end the conversation</b> - the online consultant cannot end the chat, even if the conversation flows into a curse.  And sometimes it happens that the conversation begins with foul language, but then the visitor realizes that he is talking to a real person, apologizes and buys the product. </li><li>  <b>You need to join the chat right away</b> - the visitor does not wait more than 2 minutes after clicking on the online consulting button, he simply closes the window if no one appears. </li><li>  <b>It is necessary to answer quickly</b> - the time of writing a message by the operator should be less than the time of writing a message by the client <br></li><li>  <b>Contextual questions work well</b> - the consultant always knows on which page the visitor is, knows the whole history of the visit, knows the previous visits, knows the entry point to the site and where it came from.  Use all this information when communicating, do not be lazy, any drop of information about the visitor is worth its weight in gold. </li><li>  <b>The initiative should be a little bit on the side of the consultant</b> - managing the consultant‚Äôs move, but not too intrusive, it should be natural.  A little more questions should be asked by the operator. </li><li>  <b>You do not need to write for a long time</b> - if the operator takes a <b>long time to get the</b> message, the visitor will have time to ask a few questions, in addition he will be dissatisfied with the fact that he is waiting for an answer for a long time, although he will see that the operator is dialing something. </li><li>  <b>You do not need to give a very detailed answer</b> - a very detailed answer is not needed, because  it is a live communication, and not a correspondence by e-mail, it is better to clarify what exactly the client is interested in, the maximum is a couple of sentences, one is better. </li><li>  <b>We need to help each other -</b> when one operator is talking, another operator can follow the chat and prompt the first </li><li>  <b>We carry the client</b> - if the person has already arrived and communicated with Operator A before, it is better that the same Consultant A continues the communication in the next message. </li><li>  <b>The communication style is slightly more formal than the visitor's communication style.</b> </li><li>  <b>The answer is not monosyllabic</b> - you need to answer briefly and clearly, it is best to make sure that this answer suits the client and ask what else the visitor is interested in. </li><li>  <b>We finish the conversation</b> - sometimes the conversation already ceases to be constructive, so it is better to ask "Can I still help with something about the products of our company?" </li></ol>  Surely, I forgot a lot and some may be controversial :) <br>  So it will be great to listen to the views of the readers. <br><br>  <strong>Upd 1 Answering</strong> quickly is really very important, I understand that everyone wanted to check it, but now we simply can't cope, so I apologize to all who had to wait. </div>
