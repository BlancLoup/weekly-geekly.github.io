  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nintendo wants to monetize amateur video on YouTube</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/647/214/804/6472148046925888c44eb0114daa6375.jpg" align="right">  According to Nintendo, if an amateur video with the passage of its game is published on YouTube, then Nintendo should receive income from contextual advertising in this video. <br><br>  One of the users, Zack Scott (Zack Scott), <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ZackScottFans/posts/10151890122200130">complained</a> that Nintendo‚Äôs Luigi‚Äôs Mansion: Dark Moon videotaped video clips were published by Content ID.  This means that the right holder has recognized the content belonging to him and wants to transfer to his address all advertising revenue that was received when the video was shown. <br><br>  Gamer strongly disagree with this question.  He is convinced that every passing game is unique.  This is the difference between computer games and movies or TV shows.  ‚ÄúIf I watch a movie that is watched by another person, then I no longer need to watch it.  If I watch the other person play the game, I want to play it myself! ‚Äù, Says Zack Scott. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The gamer believes that the audience of his YouTube channel watches videos with the passage of games for several reasons: for the sake of authoring and reviewing the game, for studying the game and passing individual parts, well, just for the pleasure of observing the author at certain game moments.  Zack Scott has already published the passage of many games, and had never before received such claims with the requirement to select advertising revenue.

      As it turned out, Zack Scott is not the only victim of Nintendo‚Äôs actions, and this is not at all a YouTube algorithm error, as it sometimes happens, but the result of a targeted company policy. <br><br>  For the Game Edition game publication, Nintendo sent an <a href="http://www.gamefront.com/nintendo-flexing-copyright-clout-on-youtube-lets-play-channels/">official comment</a> : ‚ÄúTo ensure that Nintendo content is published via social media channels in a correct and secure form, we have registered as a YouTube partner, and in February 2013 we registered our copyrighted content in the YouTube database.  For most amateur videos, this does not mean any changes, but for videos with Nintendo-owned content, such as images and audio, of a certain length, advertising will now appear at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the video. ‚Äù <br><br>  Nintendo emphasizes that it would like to encourage the publication of videos by gamers - therefore, ‚Äúunlike other companies‚Äù, it does not require blocking materials with its intellectual property. <br><br>  Apparently, the practice of monetizing amateur videos can become standard on YouTube.  In a comment to this story about Nintendo, well-known game developer Notch tweeted that they had a meeting with YouTube representatives, and they offered to receive a portion of advertising revenue from all Minecraft videos.  ‚ÄúIt was tempting,‚Äù admits Notch. <br><br>  It seems that YouTube is the initiator of such actions - and offers a partnership agreement to various gaming studios.  Apparently, they really have <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Den%26answer%3D138161">legal grounds</a> for this.  It seems that every game developer has the right to set rules for publishing works using content belonging to him, including the right to block amateur videos with the passage of their games.  However, many developers are more loyal to this than Nintendo.  For example, the legal FAQ from Blizzard <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/videopolicy.html">states</a> that the company allows its products to be used for commercial use in the partner programs YouTube, Justin.tv, Blip.tv, Own3d.tv and Ustream.tv. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180191/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180191/</a></p>
