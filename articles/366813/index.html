Expensive wired office Internet, a satellite with pings for 1.5 seconds, GPRS for a dollar per megabyte, and here I am your Yota!  The logo fully corresponded to the enchanting appearance of the new Internet provider - they put all the ‚Äúoffice‚Äù providers on their ears.  And what do we have today? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98c/b1d/5f9/98cb1d5f9eb54e6e9b8898e37c378c24.PNG"><br>  <i>Six days Karl!</i>  <i>Six days I will download this update from Microsoft through the whit ...</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And today Yota works in such a way that once again there is a desire to look for an alternative, at the end of the post there will be a small overview of unlimited tariffs without restrictions on speed and on traffic that I managed to get from the big three.  All described happened and occurs in the Moscow region.

    <h2>  How it was </h2><br>  At the start, Yota was really surprised.  Against the background of 20 thousand per month for a channel of one megabit from an office provider, during the crisis, Yota offered 20 megabits (10 real) for 900 rubles per month.  Technical support struck by its responsiveness and competence.  Every day it was possible to observe the expansion of the coverage area. <br><br>  First, Yota offered to access the Internet wirelessly.  Now no binding to the address and the type of room.  You can issue a contract for an individual and use the Internet in the office.  Secondly, there are no restrictions on the amount of downloaded data and there is no threshold value, after which the access speed drops to the notorious 64 kbit / s.  For a geek, it‚Äôs not a problem to monitor traffic, unlike ordinary plankton. <br><br><h2>  How did it develop </h2><br>  In 2012, Yota threw many, replacing WiMAX technology with LTE, and having done so on the same day, turned off the WiMAX network in the evening and turned on LTE.  Someone will say that Yota distributed LTE modems to its active WiMAX users in advance and for free.  If you look at it, it‚Äôs not so free, Yota raised the tariff even more in advance from 900 to 1,400 rubles per month, thus donating from subscribers to LTE modems with a good margin. <br><br>  My DIR-320 router with firmware from enthusiasts refused to accept the new Yota modem, and the old WiMAX modem stopped seeing the network.  The new network, by the way, did not see the network either, until it moved to another corner of the room.  Technical support week was overloaded so that the calls just fell through.  Simultaneously with the transition to LTE, on the sly, Yota changed the legal entity from Scartel LLC to Yota LLC. <br><br>  In 2014, Yota declared itself a mobile operator, probably, this is the beginning of the end of the Internet provider.  Since then, the quality of the Internet only falls. <br><br><h2>  What we have today </h2><br>  We must pay tribute to the team Yota, started even then, in 2009.  It was a real coup, a good kick in the backside of the lured Internet providers of office and business centers, who were forced to cut prices on the Internet by orders of magnitude.  Gradually, the three operators began to show signs of loyalty to subscribers - consumers of mobile Internet traffic, reducing the cost of a megabyte in the package of services. <br><br>  Years passed, cloud services came into vogue, Internet traffic is growing at an unprecedented pace.  The big three started in LTE, all have a frequency aggregation, in some places you can find three frequencies (800, 1800 and 2600).  Traffic packs and speeds are only growing, but still limited. <br><br>  And what about Yota?  How does she manage to remain unlimited without traffic restrictions?  In fact, Yota is not so unlimited, as advertised slogans.  Yota actively uses restrictions on the type of traffic, so that the subscriber will still not be able to download hundreds of gigabytes within a month.  According to my observations, the highest priority is given to the site speedtest.net, then http and https, p2p is clamped to the maximum, somewhere near ftp.  For corporate services, the division by type of traffic acts unpredictably. <br><br><h2>  What are the alternatives </h2><br>  I began to look for an alternative to Yota.  The main criterion is the absence of any traffic restrictions.  Our office does not need terabytes, and even dozens of gigabytes is enough, but unpredictable things happen, such as updates to Windows or Android on employees' smartphones, and sometimes video courses are watching, in such situations, traffic goes off scale.  Deploying and maintaining a control system for each user is simply unprofitable.  I just want to pay a certain amount for the Internet per month and not be distracted by the rest of the traffic. <br><br>  Perseverance led to the fact that I was able to get a really unlimited Internet from the whole three operators.  Each operator hides tariffs as much as possible, but they are still there.  Checked quite simply.  Experiments conducted in the Moscow region.  At the weekend, I put torrents on the external disk for 1 TB and left for a week, after a week I was convinced that the disk was full, I cleared and downloaded a couple more movies, watching the speed, then put the next SIM card for another week.  All three operators of the week were running out of stock for downloading 1 TB of films via p2p. <br><br>  The easiest way was to get an unlimited Megaphone.  According to Megaphone, I even managed to get a dealership.  Tariff 750 rubles per month, 3G / 4G + / LTE-A, service area - Central Russia.  Moscow tariff, issued either on a passport nat.  persons, or on jur.  face. <br><br>  In second place Beeline.  The tariff is 690 rubles per month, 3G / 4G + / LTE-A, the service area is all of Russia, except for the Far East and the Crimea.  Regional tariff, presumably St. Petersburg, is not issued in any way, bought on Avito. <br><br>  In third place is MTS.  The tariff is 950 rubles per month, only 4G + / LTE-A, the service area is only the Moscow Region.  Moscow tariff, bought on Avito, reissued on the passport in the MTS salon. <br><br>  My humble experience has shown that with a certain perseverance you can get an honest unlimited tariff, I think that this is possible in any region. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366813/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366813/</a></p>
