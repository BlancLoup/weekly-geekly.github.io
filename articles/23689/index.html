The main thing is formulated briefly and succinctly, so I decided to share it with the habra people.  Sod rolls themselves have already felt it all, but maybe they could not formulate.  But the students, I think, will really be useful. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  0. Life is not fair - get used to it! <br><br>  1. The world does not care about your self-esteem.  Life will require you to finish the job <b>before</b> you feel confident.

      2. You will not receive $ 60,000 a year immediately after school.  You will not become a vice president of a company with a satellite phone in a car before you make money on them. <br><br>  3. Do you think the teacher is too picky?  Wait when you become the boss. <br><br>  4. Serve hamburgers no lower than your dignity.  Your grandparents used another word to distribute cutlets - they called it an Opportunity. <br><br>  5. If you get into a puddle, it‚Äôs not your parents‚Äôs fault, do not whimper, learn from mistakes. <br><br>  6. Before you were born, your parents were not as boring as they are now.  They became them, paying your bills, washing your clothes and listening to your thoughts about yourself.  Therefore, before you start saving the world from the generation of your parents, clean the toilet in your own room. <br><br>  7. Your school may have ended the division into leaders and losers, but life <b>does not</b> .  Some schools do not give bad grades and give you as many attempts as you need for the correct answer.  This has nothing to do with real life. <br><br>  8. Life is not divided into semesters.  You will not have a summer vacation and there are few employers who are interested in <b>finding you</b> .  Search at your expense! <br><br>  9. Television is <b>not</b> real life.  In fact, people usually have to go to work and not sit at a cafe table. <br><br>  10. Be courteous with crabs and nerds.  It is possible that soon you will work for one of them. </blockquote><br><br>  It is said that Bill Gates said this, but a reliable source was not found quickly.  I took from <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_psychology/1029369.html">LJ</a> .  Perhaps it was not even Bill Gates who said this, but someone else scored from different places.  In any case, where he took it, the rules were drawn up in different styles, and even now it is felt a little. <br><br>  As it turned out, this is not Gates.  The truth is in English <a href="http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/b/billgatesspeech.htm">here</a> (if you can believe it <a href="http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/b/billgatesspeech.htm">too</a> ;).
