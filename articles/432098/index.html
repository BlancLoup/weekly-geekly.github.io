One of the options is that the driver‚Äôs head created the necessary effort on the steering wheel and the car‚Äôs automatics took it for granted.  There were several other options for cheating autopilot.  The easiest is an orange.  On Model C this focus <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">worked</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8R-v8yAElz4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  but <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">on Model 3</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZlvwfJEZqQ4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  - not really, even lemons with grapefruits did not help.  There are more advanced comrades who have already offered technical means to <a href="https://electrek.co/2018/09/09/tesla-autopilot-buddy-hack-avoid-nag-relaunch-phone-mount-nhtsa-ban/">deceive the autopilot</a> . <br><br>  But, this is all the lyrics, because at the moment, all the "autopilots" are at the 2nd level of automation (perhaps, the last update from Tesla has advanced a little further), and this means that all these attempts to circumvent the requirements of automatics for controlling vehicle movement - an attempt to win a Darwin Award. <br><br>  The second question is why the car did not stop at the request of the law enforcement officers who acted according to the instructions.  They acted according to the instructions that work with people, but with machines it would not work.  I think that after such events, another instruction is already being written for the policemen on how to act in the future.  In this situation, the case is unique, the person was ‚Äúout of touch,‚Äù and the car was driving itself.  In automatics, there are no algorithms for which they should pull over to the side of the road and stop completely if a policeman with flashing beacons is driving from behind or in front.  Even on the audio stream is not designed autopilot.  Automatics perceived the police car as an ordinary vehicle.  When the police "pressed to the side of the road" Tesla's car, then there was nothing left for the automatics to do but to slow down to zero, because it was not possible to drive in a straight line.  In this regard, the Tesla driver was lucky that he had not turned on the autopilot in the map navigation mode in beta mode.  In earlier versions of the autopilot update 9.0 from Tesla, just in the navigation mode you could set the route and the ‚Äúaggressiveness‚Äù of changing lanes for traffic.  In this mode, the autopilot personally made decisions when and how to change lanes for it, without human intervention, and it was possible to intervene and rearrange into different lanes when the necessary turn signal was turned on, but this was not necessary.  And with the option "Mad Max" (Mad Max) - rebuilt very quickly, as for the autopilot.  Here are some examples: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">here you can see the narrative of this "feature"</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/igAHFbU5x1w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">in that</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HYUnJos5Nqs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  and <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">and this video</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hcSy9uZm-aE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  You can see how the car drives itself and rebuilt along the lanes.  But, in the final version, Tesla abandoned this idea, <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">maybe even for the better.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hif8pe80Xxs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  That is, we can imagine how the guards could respond to the usual actions of the autopilot.  The car is traveling along a route to a given point, there is an obstacle in the current lane, it is rebuilt into the left lane and tries to go further at the maximum allowed speed.  At this time, the police see an unmanaged car, the driver is asleep and does not respond to the voice commands to stop the car.  The speed is over 100 km / h, this is a potential threat to other road users, the simplest thing they could do was to force the car to stop, using physical contact and they would be right according to all their instructions.  And at such a speed, a turn or a car‚Äôs exit from the road is very unsafe. <br><br>  Yes, we can say that the driver was drunk and did not understand what he was doing. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here is</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXls4cdEv7c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  the man fell asleep and was driving in traffic  This is not news when people fall asleep at the wheel.  Unfortunately, for this reason, there is not a small number of accidents. <br><br>  But there are other drivers who consciously drive in the passenger seat. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Time</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kmcjk8QBmkE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Two</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cq3TAWq8-g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  That is, such cases may be more and more.  And to ensure the safety of other road users need to take action. <br><br>  One of the options is to refine the autopilot, which would react to the special signals of vehicles of various services (police, ambulance, firefighters).  Mask about this <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">wrote</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-1" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1069416551038640129"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br></div></div><br>  that they will add this option in the coming months to their neural network.  This is a reference to the 3rd version of Autopilot from Tesla with their AI and new hardware, which will be several orders of magnitude faster than the current one.  It sounds great, everyone is waiting, 2-3 years already.  But I have one question.  And how much is it just like this to add an adequate "reaction" to the spec.  cars with their "chandelier" and sound signals?  That is, it must be a level 5 autopilot.  Respond correctly to signs, other maneuverable cars, markings and traffic lights.  Not every average driver is able to drive without breaking the rules.  And here is another additional factor - "light-noise cars."  As it turned out, during the recent discussion on Habr√© in the next topic, not every driver knows what to do if a police car with blue and red beacons is on.  Yes, it is not difficult for an autopilot to prescribe what to do if cars with lighthouses appear.  I have another question - how will they identify this whole stream of information.  It is more complicated than a regular traffic light. <br><br>  Suppose autopilots reached such a level that they "see" the police and the ambulance a mile away.  It's all great, I have a reasonable question - will the authorities insist that such services have the ability to remotely stop or slow down cars.  I think that they should stand in line for such an option.  Yes, you can imagine that there is a call, a fire, a route is being laid, and all the cars along the way are special.  Transport understand that you need to give up and go to the side, and firefighters get to the place of fire for 3 minutes.  Fantasy.  On the other hand, there is a chance that this can be abused.  It would not be desirable, but now it is extremely difficult to move the flow of cars to the side, when behind the ‚Äúwheel‚Äù is a living person who is not very interested in giving way to another official.  Therefore, in my understanding, governments will accept auto pilots in the end, but with reservations, that at any moment we will be able to control as we wish.  Tools manufacturers themselves must provide.  On the one hand, this is an increase in road safety and an increase in throughput, and on the other hand, your property, a car, which is not yours, with the specific desire of certain people. <br><br>  As a result, you can now ask a rhetorical question, and how far should the development in terms of autopilots go. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432098/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432098/</a></p>
