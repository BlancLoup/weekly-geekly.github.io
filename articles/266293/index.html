  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Linux and free cloud storage</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In an attempt to mount MS Onedrive in Linux, a thought arose - and what kind of clouds are there that are normally mounted in a folder and at the same time offer the maximum amount?  Below is a small list of services and impressions from attempts to mount them. <br>  I will say straight away that all this was done only to satisfy curiosity, and not for later use - therefore I cannot say how the proposed solutions will behave in the long term.  But maybe someone will be useful. <br>  Clouds were selected by two parameters - the maximum free volume (preferably obtained without several dozen registrations on your referral link) and the ability to mount to a folder under Linux. <br><br>  The testing process consisted of <br>  1) Register or remember a password (if I have already been registered on this service) <br>  2) Attempt to add free space on the referral link - to check how the process looks and how easy it is to ‚Äúwind‚Äù a place yourself. <br>  3) Attempting to connect the cloud to a folder under Linux (where WebDAV works - used davfs2, where it doesn't work - other available options). <br>  4) If the attempt is successful, then several attempts to download different files are some trifle within a megabyte, 50-70 megabytes and 1.6 gigabytes. <br>  The experiments were made on hetzner'ovskom VPS with one core and gigabytes of RAM (debian stable). <br><br>  I <strong>did not look</strong> at: prices, customer convenience, teamwork capabilities, built-in editors, etc.  This is all for a full comparison of services that I do not want to do.  Who is too lazy to read the letters at the end of the table. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Mediafire </h4><br> <a href="http://mediafire.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbd/bbe/704/cbdbbe70444c14a7af0e338c4ccdaeaf.png"><br></a>  <a href="http://mediafire.com/">MediaFire</a> - at registration they give 10 gigabytes, you can raise up to 50 gigabytes with various ‚Äúquests‚Äù: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a1/081/6ba/0a10816ba7be2d0ba5af9556f8dd81c8.png" alt="mediafire_refs" width="640" height="461">

      For some reason, I immediately had 50 gigabytes (I was registered for a long time), so I got another 5 posts on Twitter and Facebook and the installation of a desktop client.  After that, I stopped displaying the list of stocks and said, ‚Äúthat's enough, enough.‚Äù  8 gigabytes can be obtained independently, another 32 - for registration on your referral link, for each registration on gigabyte.  You don‚Äôt need to add anything else, so if you‚Äôre not lazy, you can do everything from one computer - just have 32 emails first.  :) <br><br>  Work under Linux is done using the <a href="https://github.com/MediaFire/mediafire-fuse">Linux and Open-Source Toolkit for Developers</a> .  It includes an ftp-like utility and module for FUSE.  The installation instructions for the link are relevant, I did not have to think out anything myself.  It works pretty stable, the file size of 1.6 gigabytes loaded. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d7/1fe/307/6d71fe307550753834a798131b7c8363.png" alt="2015-09-05_201312" width="700" height="161"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a11/a55/66d/a11a5566d996906a57456b57dfe3981d.jpg" alt="2015-09-05_233241" width="722" height="111"><br><br>  There are two drawbacks: <br>  1) the download speed is small, about 800 megabytes per hour (or rather, you can figure out for yourself from the image above). <br>  2) when something is loaded, the user is cut off the ability to use df, for example.  Suspends until the end of the download.  On small files it is not critical, but on large ones ... <br><br>  But, in general, the ratio of available volume and capacity is not bad.  I believe that it can be used. <br><br><h4>  hubic.com </h4><br> <a href="http://hubic.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bf/030/981/6bf0309816f4eb313ca043d1a88fb296.jpg" alt="2015-09-06_102448" width="129" height="60"><br></a>  <a href="http://hubic.com/">hubic.com</a> - at registration give 25 gigabytes, you can get another 5, if you come by referral and 25 gigabytes to dial referrals (5 gigabytes for each registered) - total 55 gigabytes.  You do not need to install a client during registration, so until the maximum account can be increased in a few minutes, there would be five spare boxes.  WebDAV is missing, there is a <a href="https://forums.hubic.com/showthread.php%3F272-hubiC-for-Linux-beta-is-out-!">native client for Linux</a> (synchronization), so far the beta version.  To mount to a folder - <a href="https://github.com/TurboGit/hubicfuse">hubicfuse</a> .  It is installed and configured according to the instructions, I have not met any pitfalls. <br>  There are no problems with the use (except those stated in the documentation - you cannot rename folders and copy files to the root).  Download speed is good. <br><br>  Suitable for use. <br><br><h4>  mega.co.nz </h4><br> <a href="http://mega.co.nz/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b90/d4d/7b1/b90d4d7b10fd7f41afb044db72d21e77.png" alt="01_mega_logo.svg" width="100" height="39"><br></a>  <a href="http://mega.co.nz/">mega.co.nz</a> - immediately give 50 gigabytes, increase - only for money.  For free users there is a limit of 10 gigabytes of traffic per half hour.  That is, if you put 10 gigabytes in there in 10 minutes, then you will be put off for half an hour.  WebDAV is not, there is a <a href="https://mega.nz/">client for synchronization</a> , including under Linux. <br>  Or you can use a <a href="http://megatools.megous.com/">set of tools for the command line</a> (on <a href="https://github.com/megous/megatools">github</a> ) - creating an account, uploading and downloading files, and a program for mounting the repository to a folder.  For debian unstable there is a deb-package, but I use stable, so I had to compile from source, there were no pitfalls in the process.  But they showed up after installation - as it turned out, copying files is not implemented here yet.  You can only create folders and delete files.  Therefore I had to dig further. <br>  Dug <a href="https://github.com/matteoserva/MegaFuse/">MegaFuse</a> .  It was not so easy with the build (a couple of libraries were called differently, I had to add a swap file - the RAM was over), but in the end everything compiled, started and worked. <br>  Features: <br>  1) MegaFuse works like a demon, that is, you must either push it into the screen, or make a service out of it. <br>  2) Drives files through / tmp - first copies there, then uploads to the server - watch for free space. <br>  Download speed in the region of 600-1000 kilobytes / second, 1.6GB was loaded, the processor and RAM MegaFuse does not require much. <br><br>  Suitable for use (minus slightly zamorochennoy settings).  But a sufficiently large volume without unnecessary gestures and good speed completely redeem this confusion. <br><br><h4>  cubby.com </h4><br> <a href="http://cubby.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/901/370/132/901370132f44fec93cab2e960a2a7faa.jpg" alt="2015-09-06_085630" width="179" height="49"><br></a>  <a href="http://cubby.com/">cubby.com</a> - initially give 5 gigabytes, you can raise up to 25 referrals (per gigabyte apiece, installation of the client is required).  There is <a href="http://help.cubby.com/knowledgebase/articles/143917-can-i-use-cubby-via-webdav">WebDAV</a> , no file size limit stated, 1.6GB loaded fine.  True, if you load into the root, then the files go to where it is not clear.  You need to put them in folders (cubbies in local terminology). <br>  In general - a good service, if you roll it up to 25 gigabytes.  Is that the reputation of logmein can scare (they once stopped providing free remote control service, warning the day before).  But I think that this is not scary for cloud storage - you won‚Äôt store a single copy of your files in a foreign cloud?  :) <br>  Suitable for use. <br><br><h4>  box.com </h4><br> <a href="http://box.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b76/7f8/80f/b767f880f39784449e520f2ac9854937.png" alt="Box_cyan" width="100" height="53"><br></a>  <a href="http://box.com/">box.com</a> - 10 gigabytes, do not give free increase.  But some people could have 50 gigabytes since box.net (I still have).  There is a free file size limit for a free user - 250 megabytes. <br>  There is <a href="http://community.box.com/t5/Managing-Your-Content/Does-Box-support-WebDAV/ta-p/310">WebDAV</a> , it works without problems, the download speed is good. <br>  It is limited to use.  But if you have 50 gigabytes left here, and you don‚Äôt care about the maximum file size, I can recommend it. <br><br><h4>  copy.com </h4><br> <a href="http://copy.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/023/a25/2b6/023a252b6bbdd7b730134366598dbd18.jpg" alt="2015-09-06_074650" width="252" height="69"><br></a>  <a href="http://copy.com/">copy.com</a> - 15 gigabytes at once + 25 gigabytes by referrals (5 * 5, they require client installation) - a total of 40 gigabytes.  If you register by <a href="https://copy.com/%3Fr%3DIORcsZ">referral</a> , then immediately upon registration they give 5 gigabytes (but I don‚Äôt know whether they are counted in the general heap or added separately, like in hubic ones). <br>  There is a <a href="">client for Linux</a> (including the <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/rwxnma/how-to-install-copy-com-on-a-headless-linux">console</a> ), but there is only synchronization. <br>  There is a <a href="https://github.com/copy-app/copy-fuse">script for mounting</a> to a folder, but it did not work for me normally. <br>  Yes, the folder is mounted.  You can go there, create folders, copy some small files.  But when I try to copy a file of 50 megabytes, I get: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9a/aa3/150/c9aaa3150fe0898f224a7c7361a5a197.jpg" alt="2015-09-06_081900" width="525" height="37"><br><br>  So, in general, although the service is not bad, the competition did not pass.  Although if you are only satisfied with synchronization - why not?  The volume, good opportunities, rather high download speed, no file size limitations stated. <br><br><h4>  4shared </h4><br> <a href="http://4shared.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ed/458/aba/6ed458aba56f4c5573d4acd8ac1999b7.jpg" alt="2015-09-06_074057" width="163" height="43"><br></a>  <a href="http://4shared.com/">4shared</a> - 15 GB is given for free, it is impossible to increase.  The account lives half a year since the last visit, but there is a reminder that the validity period is ending.  The maximum file size is 2 gigabytes.  There is an official WebDAV, it works fine. <br>  You can use it, but there are more interesting options. <br><br><h4>  Yandex.Disk </h4><br> <a href="http://disk.yandex.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/173/db7/af2/173db7af224bba37483c1d8d43519f94.jpg" alt="2015-09-06_072026" width="73" height="58"><br></a>  <a href="http://disk.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Disk</a> - initially gives 10 gigabytes, up to 20 can be raised to referrals (500 megabytes each, installation of the client is required).  Sometimes there are temporary shares that give a couple of gigabytes for a year or two.  But two or three years ago, there was an action on the distribution of 200 gigabytes to victims of their synchronization program, because there are people with free 200+ gigabytes.  There is an <a href="">official WebDAV</a> .  Works without problems.  The maximum file size is 10 gigabytes. <br>  It can be recommended for use in case you do not need a lot of space or you are one of those who received 200 gigabytes.  I am not one of those, because Yandex.disk is rarely used.  I even had only 7 gigabytes of limit there, I had to ask for support to increase to 10 for order. <br><br><h4>  Cloudme </h4><br> <a href="https://www.cloudme.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd8/caa/9b4/fd8caa9b44b504cfbd1cbbdcbe852e60.jpg" alt="2015-09-06_000340" width="257" height="46"><br></a>  <a href="https://www.cloudme.com/">CloudMe</a> - 3 gigabytes, referrals increase to 19 gigabytes with 500 megabytes from each registered (and 500 most registered, you only need to confirm the mailbox).  There is an official <a href="https://www.cloudme.com/en/webdav">WebDAV</a> , I did not notice any difficulties in its use. <br>  For a free user, there is a file size limit of 150 megabytes. <br>  In general, the option is acceptable, but it can be interesting only if Yandex.Disk is not satisfied. <br><br><h4>  Onedrive </h4><br> <a href="http://onedrive.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d4/255/043/3d4255043ae3ddacad495b3547bec52e.jpg" alt="2015-09-05_231240" width="164" height="50"><br></a>  <a href="http://onedrive.com/">OneDrive</a> - give free 15 gigabytes, you can bring up to 23 gigabytes (3 for autoloading photos, 5 for given clients).  I have 40 GB of free gigabytes here - an old user (and you can still get 5).  The file size limit is 10 gigabytes.  There is WebDAV, but because of the peculiarities of authorization it works only under windows, and davfs breaks off. <br>  Therefore, to mount the folder, you will have to use a bunch of two programs - <a href="https://github.com/mk-fg/python-onedrive">python-onedrive</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mk-fg/onedrive-fuse-fs/">onedrive-fuse-fs</a> . <br>  In principle, it works.  But with a bunch of reservations.  Resource is mounted, yes: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fa/8a8/547/3fa8a854702a22ee5e03ef80e23da00c.jpg" alt="2015-09-05_234117" width="800" height="191"><br><br>  But when you try to copy something begins: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e36/8bd/a17/e368bda17d55b079fbfcf0a105135a5a.jpg" alt="2015-09-05_234324" width="756" height="33"><br><br>  Because I had to abandon the mount and use onedrive-cli to download files.  He works, really swears. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fec/e71/d19/fece71d195bf7a3a24a85009c8d2551b.jpg" alt="2015-09-05_234630" width="795" height="65"><br><br>  But at the same time, the files load normally and quite quickly - a file of 70 megabytes in size was loaded for less than a minute, and the same file was downloaded for about ten minutes.  The 1.6 gb file was also successfully loaded, although in that case the abuse was on the screen, and not just one line. <br>  In general, I do not recommend free onedrive for use under Linux.  There are more interesting options. <br><br><h4>  ADrive.com </h4><br> <a href="http://adrive.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63c/6c1/9a8/63c6c19a84d6b18225b6ffb7ad963e17.png" alt="adrive_logo" width="180" height="40"><br></a>  <a href="http://adrive.com/">ADrive.com</a> - give free 50 gigabytes for free, but on this for a free user almost everything is limited (the minimum subscription is 100 gigabytes for $ 25 a year).  But subscribers have not only WebDAV, but also scp, ftp, rsync.  That is why I mention this service in the list. <br><br><h4>  Cloud Mail.ru </h4><br> <a href="http://cloud.mail.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1cb/e2c/ea9/1cbe2cea9993c99f4d11c6f790ae634d.jpg" alt="2015-09-05_221939" width="409" height="59"><br></a>  <a href="http://cloud.mail.ru/">cloud.mail.ru</a> .  Offering free 25 gigabytes, an increase only for money.  Although, I think many people have 100 gigabytes or even a terabyte there (during the writing of this article, I put things in order in my clouds and found exactly terabyte on mail.ru :).  The main problem with a free account (even with a terabyte) is the limit on the maximum file size, 2 gigabytes.  Although for owners of free terabyte there is a special tariff that removes this restriction (500 rubles a year - and you can upload files up to 32 gigabytes).  WebDAV works for them in test mode, that is, it does not work at all. <br>  There is a <a href="https://help.mail.ru/cloud_web/app/about">client under Linux</a> , but only folder synchronization, without mounting.  On the githab there is a <a href="https://github.com/Anonym-tsk/mailru-cloud">console version of the client</a> - it works as a service, but it is kind of suspicious.  I did not check. <br>  But if they ever get WebDAV, the service will be noteworthy. <br><br><h3>  Results </h3><br>  If you collect the results in a table, it turns out like this <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b5c/312/9c8/b5c3129c8a67667f9a39303c4155246e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Greens are recommended, red ones are no good, yellow ones don't see much sense. <br><br>  Bypassed all sorts of Chinese with free terabytes (360 Yun Pan, Tencent, Baidu, etc.).  They are all unknown little animals, which can be used only when you live in China or nearby.  Although, of course, freebie is a terrible power ... :) <br>  I did not consider options with WebDAV and 2-3 gigabytes of free space - just not rational. <br><br>  I myself use onedrive'om - I have the main work under windows.  From the existing Linux farms, I can easily upload files to the Windows server (which I do - cross backups), and from there I can put the native client into the cloud.  Well, or the mentioned onedrive-cli utility, it is limitedly suitable for use if you quickly want to throw something at onedrive directly. <br><br>  Under Linux, I would look first at MEGA and hubiC, after them - Cubby and MediaFire. <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> <br>  Tablet about <a href="http://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> , <a href="http://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> , <a href="https://mediencenter.t-online.de/">T-Online</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d3/03f/758/7d303f7589963066f5da85f79fba62b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Dropbox and Google Drive are mounted using <a href="https://github.com/joe42/CloudFusion">CloudFusion</a> .  In this embodiment, the dropbox has a file size limit.  Free Google Drive simply does not make much sense compared to other services. <br>  T-Online registration in German has a google translate to help, it's easy there.  Referrals did not find, WebDAV (https://webdav.mediencenter.t-online.de) works, files up to 2 gigabytes accept, speed is not bad. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266293/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266293/</a></p>
