  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile Internet with backup channel for online broadcasts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to all participants Habr. <br><br>  The task was to organize an online broadcast of events (two events in the capital and then in other regional cities of Russia).  Since the draft amateur budget was small, I had to get out. <br><br>  To solve the problem it was necessary to solve 3 big questions: <br>  1. Provider.  Choose a software and hardware solution with a backup channel to ensure signal stability in the absence of <br>  2. Platform and client for video broadcast.  Choose a device to capture video, a client program to send streaming video. <br>  3. Mobile power.  The event, though regulated by time, had to be ready to cover a sufficiently long time (for days on end)

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Provider <br>  For the capital chose Yota and one of the mobile operators.  <a href="http://www.yota.ru/ru/buy/">Yota'vskie routers</a> ended up on sale, I had to urgently come up with a solution. <br><br>  I chose the Zyxel Keenetic 4g router (cost about 1,800 rubles), put the second generation NDMS firmware on it (thanks to the author of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/135557/">this topic</a> ) to provide automatic switching between the Yota modem and the 3G operator modem.  I set everything up without any difficulties and problems. <br><br>  That's actually the Zyxel Keenetic 4g router itself <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d39/642/897/d39642897832a64db34d317c6edde2fc.jpg"><br><br>  Modems connected through the hub <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f7/22b/a4e/7f722ba4ed387519623330ae79f998b9.jpg"><br><br>  Router with complete modems: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4f/ffe/f9f/e4fffef9fb1ed09a2568e74017a0bb65.jpg"><br><br>  2. Platform and client for video broadcast. <br>  Here they proceeded from what was (personal phones).  And there were several options for phones with a good camera.  We stopped at the Samsung Wave.  The platform for the broadcast and the client also did not take long to search.  Choose between ustream.tv and bambuser.  Only bambuser had support for Samsung BADA. <br><br>  3. Mobile power.  I decided not to think for a long time, but to prepare for the most difficult variant (that is, a very long time broadcast). <br>  I took the usual UPS 12V battery at 7200 Ah - 690 rubles. <br>  In order not to solder anything (unfortunately there is little experience, and I also have time for fees) I bought a regular cigarette lighter from a car (110 rubles), a cigarette lighter splitter for 3 sockets (350 rubles) and a universal adapter with a different set of nozzles power router (500 rub.) <br><br>  cigarette lighter socket with splitter <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b4/5f7/7c3/2b45f77c3b3a4b78551e83698eb5e299.jpg"><br><br>  When assembled, it all looked like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75a/e2c/f47/75ae2cf474ec563f06112ea2c3e9f389.jpg"><br><br>  For the phone, the cigarette lighter charge was also purchased, so it was also possible not to worry about the battery and work on wi-fi. <br><br>  All this neatly fit into a backpack.  The phone immediately connected to the charging, connected to a pre-configured access point and the broadcast started. <br><br>  The battery was more than enough.  Even after 5 or 6 hours of broadcasting, I accidentally forgot to turn off the router in my backpack from the battery (I got tired, I really wanted to sleep :).  The car in which the backpack was left was parked right under the window of the 2nd floor and in the morning, turning on the phone, I found my access point. <br><br>  It is clear that this method is very amateur.  The topic of conducting online broadcasts of events interests many.  Unfortunately, access to professional equipment such as <a href="http://live-u.ru/liveu-lu30.php">LiveU</a> , satellite TV, etc.  there is not many. <br>  The LiveU technology is interesting because there the signal transmission occurs through several providers simultaneously.  The stream is divided into several parts, it is collected on an intermediate server with broadband Internet by special software and then the stream is transmitted for broadcast.  I have already asked everyone if any software can make such a trick on their own, but have not yet found how, I will be glad if anyone has any ideas)) <br><br>  PS I can't stand the quality of the picture, unfortunately, because the event that happened to be was very large (a large number of people, a large load on the operators) <br>  <a href="http://bambuser.com/v/2738337">That's how</a> it looked, the quality is not so hot, because I had to set everything to a minimum. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146276/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146276/</a></p>
