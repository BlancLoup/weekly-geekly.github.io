  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why MGTS moves PON</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Hello, I am an MGTS engineer and I was very interested in a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/188454">post</a> about vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi routers used for subscribers using the PON technology.  Since new users cannot write comments, I write immediately a post with their thoughts on this topic. <br><br>  I just want to say that I don‚Äôt do PONom in my work (fortunately), but I have the opportunity to communicate with those people who are associated with it.  Be sure to give them information from the post and ask them to express their views.  True, there are serious concerns that the result will be insignificant.  The Chinese customer ‚Äúhardware‚Äù is purchased by cars, the configuration is poured by the conveyor method, and ‚Äúnegros‚Äù are involved in switching on subscribers, that is, excuse me, representatives of contracting organizations, and for that kind of money for which not a single full-time employee even leaves. <br><br>  Therefore, I want to touch on a slightly different topic.  Why does MGTS need this PON at all, with all its high cost and unreliability?  Why <a href="http://mgts.ru/upload/images/r/cover1607.pdf">such</a> hysteria with this all?  Yes, progressive technology, yes, good speed and competitive advantages.  But, in my opinion, the root is a bit different.  It has a name and a legal entity - MGTS-real estate CJSC. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is little information about this company, such small <a href="http://officemonitor.ru/news/2903-Nedvijimost-MGTS.html">notes</a> were mentioned about its creation last year.  Meanwhile, since its inception, this company has become one of the largest owners of real estate in Moscow!  Million square meters, this is, you know, not a joke.  In the first place in terms of volume - Mega with Ikea, and they have only <a href="http://realty.lenta.ru/news/2012/12/21/ikea">two</a> .  MGTS-Real Estate owns all the buildings of an automatic telephone exchange in Moscow, and these are several hundred capital buildings.  Most of them are frame reinforced concrete, six floors of five meters each, of which twelve ordinary floors are easily made.  It is a sin not to use such a resource at current real estate prices.  Moreover, the true owner of the entire MGTS (as well as MTS, Bashneft and other steamboat newspapers) - <a href="http://www.sistema.ru/">AFK-System</a> has long <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/forbes/issue/2006-02/13645-reiting-krupneishih-vladeltsev-nedvizhimosti-moskva/">dreamed of</a> moving from the 28th place in the rating of Moscow real estate owners somewhere higher.

      However, there is a slight nuisance; most of the building is occupied by these nasty telephone exchanges with their employees.  However, this problem is solved.  The equipment is mostly outdated, it has long had to be changed.  The process of transition to the ‚Äúfigure‚Äù began in the USSR, with the traditional break for the 90s, but due to huge volumes and continuous progress, it naturally lags behind.  More recently, in some places on the PBX, it was possible to find serviceable equipment on radio tubes!  However, now there is an additional incentive.  The amount of equipment that occupied five floors 40 years ago, already 20 years ago fit into two, and now - in one room. <br><br>  The process of refurbishing stations in full swing.  One of the first began to disassemble ATC-921, at the address of New Arbat, 2 (which is not surprising).  Some buildings will be converted into <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/20121214153844.shtml">hotels</a> , for example.  Moreover, these hotels have long been working.  At one of the automatic telephone exchanges in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNagornaya in the former automobile hall, there are dense rows of bunks for guest workers ... <br><br>  Honestly, I had never before imagined the scale of the tragedy.  Well, I thought they would transfer all the equipment to the first floor, as they already did, and the rest - for offices, dog with it.  But now, more and more often I hear from knowledgeable people that MGTS is planning to abandon PBX buildings in general!  Completely!  Of course, formally they have not been owned by the operator for a year now, but for the present there remains the main thing - crosses. <br><br>  What is cross?  This is a room on the first floor where all the copper cables of the area come.  Each apartment has a direct connection through a pair of copper wires with a cross.  Previously, this was the main advantage of MGTS, because to enable fast Internet via ADSL, you do not need to build anything, you just need to install modems from two sides, to put it simply.  Now, for example, video surveillance is being done at a frantic pace throughout the city and at polling stations.  This, in fact, makes MGTS for old copper.  But copper is no longer in vogue, optics in vogue.  Therefore, the process of leaving the old scheme goes with might and main.  For example, you heard that MGTS offers some very high speeds on ADSL, 10 Mbps, 20 Mbps?  In fact, through a simple copper pair, even if the cable is not laid under Khrushchev, but under Brezhnev, so much simply will not work.  The secret is that before the RS (distribution cabinet at home) the Internet is on optics, there is a DSLAM near the RS, and the ADSL technology only works for a short distance, no farther than the next door and the right floor.  With this scheme, no PBX is needed anymore, it‚Äôs enough to reach for the optics to the Internet connection point, which may be few and much more compact. <br><br>  What's bad about it?  Well, blackouts, for example.  Last week, electricity was <a href="http://mir24.tv/news/society/7610090/">lost</a> in the north-east of Moscow, Medvedkovo, Sviblovo and Babushkinsky were left without power.  Meals were served, but the home Internet MGTS did not work right away, because a lot of DSLAMs just hung.  Several dozen houses.  Engineers then went to overload cards in the cabinets for several days ... <br><br>  In general, I am very sorry for the former reliability of the telephone network.  Once, each PBX was a strategic object, each station employee had a personal gas mask, and the entire basement of the building was occupied by an organic battery of batteries.  Even with a complete shutdown of the entire power supply in the city, the connection continued to work for several hours.  After the memorable <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B2_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5_%25282005%2529/">2005 blackout,</a> additional diesel generators were installed near the main telephone nodes.  By the way, remember what happened then?  The good half of Moscow disconnected, including the M9 station on Butlerov Street, where one of the main traffic exchange hubs of Russia and the server of the largest local Internet resources are located.  Even in the north, where there was food, the Internet was more dead than alive. <br><br>  Now, with the new blackouts, which are simply inevitable, no one will have a telephone connection, not to mention the Internet.  Yes, someone bought a bespereboynik home, some nodes have backup batteries, but what you will not call a working network.  Returning to our PONs, it is impossible not to notice that the tree topology of this promising optical network is the most unreliable of all possible options; a bundle of optical splitters makes it impossible to determine the location of a cable break using an optical reflectometer, not to mention <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D42:21711/">other</a> disadvantages. <br><br>  So personally, I will try to stay away from PON as far as possible both as a client and as a specialist (by the way, no one offers me home phone discounts and disconnects him without hesitation if payment is delayed).  But the old network will not be anyway.  For the most persistent customers in the basement of the house will put the equipment, which will produce a traditional analog signal, and all the copper will be pulled out of the sewer will be put into scrap metal. <br><br>  What are you saying, 3 million subscribers?  For how much they pay, for five hundred rubles a month?  And some even less.  Just think, the net profit of OJSC MGTS for 2012 is <a href="http://mgts.ru/upload/images/r/mgts6_2013_1106.pdf">9.5</a> billion rubles, and assets at MGTS-Real Estate CJSC at current <a href="http://cpcapital.ru/new/17/">rates</a> are about 140 billion! <br><br>  What is the connection guys?  Communication is not relevant.  Empty the room, please. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188826/</a></p>
