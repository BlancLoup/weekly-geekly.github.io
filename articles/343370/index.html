  <section class="page js-page"><h1>EPAM + universities: how we work with universities in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  EPAM has been working closely with universities in many cities where there are our offices for many years.  We give open lectures at universities, hold hackathons, workshops, participate in organizing competitions and job fairs, supervise production practices. <br><br>  And we teach students in our laboratories.  First, we conduct courses for them on the territory of the university, which we call an external laboratory.  Then we invite the guys to our training center - the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/epam_systems/blog/336750/">internal laboratory</a> .  We already told about it, therefore today we will talk in more detail about external courses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g3/mh/ws/g3mhwsdj_33bakohicpez9yt-mo.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why do we need an external laboratory </h3><br>  The external laboratory is a joint educational project of EPAM and universities.  These are preparatory courses for students who want to gain experience and knowledge to work on real projects.

      The university program is changing slowly, so it often lags behind modern realities.  Technical universities in bundles produce specialists who have never worked with technologies that are in demand in production here and now.  But we can help.  For a student, our laboratory at a higher educational institution is an opportunity to choose a promising specialization and begin to develop in it.  We constantly add relevant technologies and approaches to the program, give many practical tasks, and learn how to work in a team. <br><br>  Universities are interested in finding jobs for their graduates, so they actively cooperate with us.  For us, universities are a place where we tell students about the company and invite them to study in our laboratories in order to offer work in the future. <br><br><h3>  How is the training organized? </h3><br>  We conduct trainings on Frontend, Java, .NET, Test Automation, business analysis for students at major universities in St. Petersburg, Ryazan, Saratov, Izhevsk and Tver.  The list of courses that we read in each of these cities can be viewed on the infographics and on our <a href="https://www.training.ru/">training portal</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g5/ce/0s/g5ce0shmlt3kku00jmk5rbainkq.jpeg"><br><br>  Initially, we took only third-fourth-year students of IT specialties to the external laboratory.  But gradually the guys from other directions began to come to us who want to change their profession.  And now our laboratory can meet historians, ecologists, or even physicians.  Usually they choose training for testing and business analysis, go through all the stages of training and after a few years successfully work in production. <br><br>  Courses on average last about a semester.  Groups consist of 12-15 people.  Classes are held about 2-3 times a week before or after couples.  They are led by practicing developers, testers, EPAM business analysts of Senior level and above, or university professors that we previously trained in the company. <br><br>  Studying in an external laboratory consists of lectures, practical exercises and independent work.  Teachers are serious about the educational process and require the same from students, therefore during the course they screen out those who do not attend lectures or do not do their homework. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fw/k2/og/fwk2ogf2rikmbx-xzz-0fergxv4.jpeg"><br><br>  Classes are usually held in the classrooms of the university.  But there are exceptions.  For example, in Saratov, we switched to an online learning format after the success of a pilot launch.  Students listen to lectures, webinars, perform homework and receive feedback from the coach.  Once a month they come to the office to talk with the teacher in person and pass an intermediate section. <br><br>  All courses, depending on the direction, end with an exam, testing or final project.  Students in practice show what they have learned. <br><br>  Those who successfully pass the exam or defend the project, we offer to continue their studies in the <a href="https://www.training.ru/">internal training center EPAM</a> .  Approximately 50-60% of students reach this stage.  The program in the internal laboratory is designed for graduate students who are more prepared and ready to immerse themselves in the process of study and begin working on a real project in three to four months. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w4/su/dz/w4sudzvhw2-s6jjoeix-xgnjew4.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  How to get on courses in high school </h3><br>  Selection to our external laboratory consists of five stages. <br><br>  <b>1. Registration</b> <br><br>  First you need to register at the <a href="https://www.training.ru/">training portal</a> , choose a course and apply for participation. <br><br>  <b>2. Interview with a recruiter</b> <br><br>  The recruiter conducts a telephone interview with all potential participants.  They need to talk about their motivation to learn from us and answer basic technical questions.  At this stage, some students are eliminated. <br><br>  <b>3. Technical interview</b> <br><br>  Those who pass on are invited to an in-person interview.  There, the candidates are interviewed by employees from the production.  They ask more complex technical questions and ask to solve two or three problems. <br><br>  As a rule, a student, a couple of days before the interview, is given a list of topics for which he will be asked, so he can prepare. <br><br>  Sometimes the guys show such a good result that we immediately call them to the internal laboratory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/71/_o/8r/71_o8rsvdvrlbywh4lt9gmgd1wu.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>4. Check the level of English</b> <br><br>  After the technical interview, we check the level of English.  It must be at least Pre-Intermediate. <br><br>  <b>5. Feedback</b> <br><br>  Students who have successfully passed all the stages, we enroll in an external laboratory.  And those who are eliminated on the way, we explain what topics need to be pulled up, and we invite you to come next time. <br><br>  Now we have open set in several directions at once.  On the <a href="https://www.training.ru/">training portal,</a> you can choose your city and register for the appropriate course.  We are waiting for you to study. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343370/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343370/</a></p>
