    <h5>  Story </h5><br>  Today (Friday) walked with a friend from the Dobryninskaya metro station to the Tulskaya metro station along Lyusinovskaya Street.  Near stopped blue Tayota Camry.  A man with a distinctly Caucasian appearance appeared from the car.  A man asked how to go to Warsaw.  I would pass by.  Firstly, because he did not know the passage (topographical cretinism, underground life and complete lack of attention to the road), secondly, the person painfully suspiciously assessed my friend and even more suspiciously stopped his eyes on his bag.  A friend took to explain the way.  Having received the answer, the passenger jumped out of a foreign car and began to thank us heartily. <br><br><h6>  Lyrical digression </h6><br>  I think, initially my friend was chosen as a victim.  First, he has an expensive and remarkable bag.  Secondly, he is very thin and in general is not the owner of impressive dimensions. <br><br>  After shaking hands with the attacker (he very persistently thanked us), we went further.  And I was almost away from the car, but the attacker grabbed his friend by the hand with the question: ‚ÄúWhat sort of dispute are you in?‚Äù  A friend, having felt something was wrong, pulled his hand back and took a step back.  At this moment the man, apparently realizing that the first goal was lost, jerked sharply in my direction with the same question.  Then, grabbing my forearm (apparently so that I, as a friend, did not pull back my hand), said that he would guess how much I weigh and, without waiting for an answer, grabbed me and began to understand me into the air.  Sensing trouble, I managed to shove my left hand in my pocket with a purse.  Unfortunately my right hand was occupied with a can of water.  :( <br>  Then everything developed rapidly.  The thief did his job cheekily and extremely quickly.  The villain let me go, and before I could put my right hand in my pocket and check for the phone, he had already jumped into the car in which his partner was waiting. <br>  So I picked up the phone of a well-known fruit company. <br><br>  Why did I decide that my case might be significant to others?  In the evening, I had a meeting with customers.  One of the guys had the same phone as the one they stole from me.  I joked about my failure, and it turned out that the second visitor lost the phone about the same way about a year ago (two Caucasian men, an elementary question on how to get to ..., fraternization, a sports question and the suggestion to weigh). .  Dear friends!  Be carefull!  Attackers act very quickly and cheekily.  With all my suspicion and, despite the fact that I immediately suspected something and was not alone, I simply did not have time to react. <br><br>  I did not call the police and simply blocked the phone number.  Now I think I did wrong. <br><br><h6>  What can be done? </h6><br>  Call the police.  DPS officers also work, which means they get bored too.  Your message to them may well be an interesting adventure.  Give the nearest posts the orientation of a couple of minutes.  My attackers had the following distinctive signs: <br><ul><li>  two men of Caucasian appearance in blue Tirati Camry </li><li>  the car had no number at the back (the attacker got out of the car so that we were behind the car) </li></ul><br>  It is quite possible (I repeat that the case was in the center) that there was a camera on the street that captured the incident.  If you have time and desire to return your good, call the police. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69404/</a></p>
