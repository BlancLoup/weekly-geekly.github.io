After reading this article even then, I was eager to control my system from the phone (good, all current phones have bluetooth;) <br><br>  I did not succeed in using BluePad, because it is designed for more or less non-small screens.  In this connection, in my screen on the Nokia 3110c, she stupidly did not interpose ... Therefore, I began to look further.  And in the process of searching, I stumbled upon such a wonderful program as <a href="http://anyremote.sourceforge.net/"><strong>anyRemote</strong></a> .  It is about her and will be discussed. <br><br>  All we need is: <br>  1) Phone with bluetooth <br>  2) Computer with Linux on board <br>  3) Bluetooth adapter for the computer.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>1) Configure bluetooth on your computer</strong> . <br>  In theory, it is quite enough for anyremote to work to install bluez-utils for yourself (if you put anyremote from the repositories in Debian, everything you need will get addicted.) In the past, many people advised you to set up an auto-request to get rid of problems, but how not strange (bug / feature?), the application on the mobile phone when you connect to the computer does not ask anything <font color="#7F7F7F">(exception, if you ask anyremote itself password request, but that's another story)</font> .  Those.  in fact, this is where the bluetooth setting on the computer is finished =) <br><br>  <strong>2) Put anyRemote.</strong> <br>  In Debian, it is in the repository.  Repositories for other distributions and download links can be found on <a href="http://anyremote.sourceforge.net/dload.html">of.sayte</a> .  I hope there will be no problems with installation either. <br><br>  <strong>3) Select the management script.</strong> <br>  Included with the program itself, you will also get a bunch of ready-made management scripts - cfg files.  Each for its task: control amarok (1.4 and 2), control mplayer, file manager, cursor control and much more.  Moreover, on of.sayte there is another car and a small cart of user scripts ... BUT!  anyRemote can work simultaneously with only one specific script. <br>  But this little annoying nuisance is corrected by the presence of the All-In-One script, which goes over the scripts folder and allows access to any of them <font color="#7F7F7F">(more precisely, to those that have records for working with All-In-one, but there are quite a few many among the ready-made solutions)</font> . <br>  At the beginning of use, I myself wrote a couple of my scripts and rewrote the finished ones ... But now, when the hands stopped scratching, the functionality of standard scripts is enough ... <br>  Detailed documentation in English.  on writing scripts is available on the offsite of the project ... Therefore, if someone is missing something, go ahead and write your own scripts with a song, good, it's pretty simple;) <br><br>  <strong>4) Run.</strong> <br>  To run, we need to specify which script we want to run with the program.  If nothing is specified, the program searches the script file first ~ / .anyremote.cfg, and if it does not find ./.remremote.cfg <br>  You can also use the <strong>-f</strong> flag to specify the path to the config file.  What I always do safely. <br>  The second useful option: <strong>-s</strong> , to indicate the type of connection ... In our case, it is -s bluetooth: 19 (default line for bluetooth). <br>  The third is quite useful option: <strong>-password</strong> .  With this option, the program will request a password from the java client and compare it with the one specified in the ~ / .anyRemote / password file.  This is a pretty useful option because  as I said above, when trying to connect to the java client‚Äôs computer, no pin is requested.  <font color="#7F7F7F"><em>(unfortunately, I could not connect with this option, because the java client stupidly hung up when trying to connect = ()</em></font> <br>  Thus, the launch takes about the following line: <ol><li> <code><font color="black">$anyremote -f ~/.anyRemote/All-In-One.cfg -s bluetooth:19</font></code> </li> </ol>  The command is registered in autoload, so after I once registered it a long time ago, I don‚Äôt remember about it anymore ... <br><br>  <strong>5) We throw off the java client on the phone.</strong> <br>  You can take it on the <a href="http://anyremote.sourceforge.net/dload.html">office</a> .  There are different sizes of icons, so it‚Äôs not a problem to choose a mobile phone. <br><br>  <strong>6) Run the java client on the phone.</strong> <br>  After launch, all we need to do is start a search on our computer.  If the search is completed successfully - select our computer from the list of found ones, and click ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù.  If the search did not give anything, you can simply enter your adapter address in the form of btspp: // 00028892D175: 19. <br><br>  <strong>7) We use!</strong> <br>  That's all.  Now, we have a full-fledged control panel for various media software and not only.  In fact - you can do anything, with the only restriction - the number of keys on the phone and your imagination when writing your own scripts =) <br><br>  PS For GUI lovers, there are 2 frontends for anyRemote: kanyRemote and ganyRemote.  They allow you to choose and change scripts on the fly (dubious happiness, if you have an All-In-One), edit scripts (also a dubious pleasure, because there are editors much better than the built-in) and download the java client to the phone (probably the only thing that can really be useful) , if you are too lazy to throw it on the phone.) <br><br>  PPS As I said, the utility is very powerful.  In addition to bluetooth, it has the ability to control via IR, Wi-Fi and via HTTP.  Therefore, everything described above is only a small part of its capabilities. <br><br>  PPPS I hope this article will help someone to find happiness and the opportunity to lie on the couch to switch the series of the series or to include music from the street in order to take revenge on the neighbors for repairs at 7 am on Sunday;) <br>  To me, this article has already brought happiness in the form of an invitation to Habr (for which many thanks to the user <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/skobkin/" class="user_link">skobkin</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80224/</a></p>
