Studying at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology at the time of my youth was considered the pinnacle of dreams for a student who is fond of physics.  I am sure that today he has largely maintained his position. <br>  If you are fond of robotics and have one or two like-minded people, as well as a desire to test yourself in an extreme situation, then it is not too late to register!  The competition itself will take place on the weekend of April 18-19.  Applications are accepted <b>until April 14</b> .  Initially, the registration was carried out until April 10, but the organizers decided to extend it to 14, so to speak, at the request of the workers.  You can register even if you do not have a team, but there is a burning desire.  It will be possible to pick up members of the team from the same singles!  Hurry up, there is very little time left! <br>  Pupils can take part in the event, but only accompanied by adults. <br>  A bonus can be an opportunity to plunge deep into the world of this cult educational institution and even spend the night in a student hostel! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Robocacaton minisumo is: </h4><br><ul><li>  The ability to create a sumo-robot for two days from scratch; </li><li>  Experience working on a project in a small team (2-3 people) under tight deadlines; </li><li>  Experienced and helpful mentors; </li><li>  2 leagues - programmers and masters; </li><li>  Minisum competitions in three leagues (programmers, masters, free); </li><li>  Exhibition of robots (robot Alantim, spherobot for research in the Arctic and much more). </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d35/1fe/768/d351fe76869e422b8f1f5dd3d8fa6d4e">

    <h4>  About the event: </h4><br>  The robotic hackathon is a two-day event, where participants will create and program sumo robots from scratch.  Experienced mentors will be ready to help and answer questions. <br><br>  Participants will be divided into 2 leagues: programmers and masters. <br>  Members can submit applications to the master league, who represent how to solder sensors, motor control board, power to the controller board, how to design and assemble the robot so that it all works.  Participants will be issued the same kits for assembling robots. <br>  Programmers may apply to the league of programmers who are interested in focusing more on the behavior of the robot during the battle and minimize the work with their hands.  Programmers will be issued almost complete set of Pololu Zumo, which requires minimal skills in soldering and mechanical work. <br><br>  It is assumed that participants who already have experience in the assembly of robots, including sumo robots, will participate in the master league.  The organizers reserve the right to final breakdown of participants by leagues. <br>  For advanced teams it will be possible to print your bases or items on a 3D printer. <br>  The hackathon will end with a minisumo competition, which will reveal the winners in both leagues. <br>  For the hackathon, it is planned to prepare sets of bases (2 and 4 motor bases) in advance so that teams (especially beginners) can save time on designing and printing the base to accommodate components of sumobots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/027/30a/727/02730a727fd94c3d81425acde7630e36.png"><br><br>  <b>Useful information</b> <br>  <a href="http://mipt.ru/alumni/events/robohackaton2015">The official page of the event</a> You can register on it. <br>  <a href="http://mipt.ru/alumni/events/robohack_components.pdf">Component list for both leagues</a> <br>  <a href="http://rus-robots.ru/data/documents/RSA-Sumo.pdf">Minisum rules</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.123dapp.com/MyCorner/toborobot.ru-24353800/recentActivity">Base samples</a> <br><br><h5>  <i>Have a good time and good luck!</i> </h5><br><br><h4>  Registration of participants extended until April 14! </h4><br><br>  I myself am in no way connected with the organization of this event, but since the article gave rise to some questions I had to get involved in the correspondence.  I publish below excerpts from it to clarify some points. <br>  Entrance to the competitions and the exhibition for the fans is FREE.  For those who want to observe the process of working teams, you must fulfill the conditions described below: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Question</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Hello. <br>  I recently learned that an interesting event is being held at your institute.  It is unlikely that I will be able to take part in it, but the question arose whether it is possible to participate as a spectator.  And if so, how to do it.  Do I need to register, where and when can I drive up? <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Good day! <br><br>  In principle, I have no objection to people coming as spectators.  Another question is that to be a spectator at the hackathon itself is not the most interesting.  You just see how many guys are sitting at computers, progat and collect robots. <br>  However, the result of the hackathon will be a robotics competition and an exhibition of robots, which will already be interesting to guests.  The robot will come to the exhibition Alantim from MIT, who knows how to communicate (learns) with people and remembers them. <br>  The exhibition will begin from 15:30 in the hall of the KZ MIPT hall (1st floor of the MIPT Group of Companies), the competition will begin at 15:30 from the lobby of the KZ MIPT hall (2nd floor of the MIPT Group of Companies). <br>  <a href="http://mipt.ru/about/general/contacts/">Chassis layout</a> : <a href="http://mipt.ru/about/general/contacts/">mipt.ru/about/general/contacts</a> <br>  If you decide to come, let me know when to wait for you and better the name of those who will be with you, so that you will provide badges and watch lists. <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374895/</a></p>
