We make high-quality content</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Nothing in the world is forever, things change over time, are transformed, or completely obsolete.  At the beginning there were printed publications, then they were replaced by radio, television followed, but only with the advent of computer and the Internet, the study of the outside world and progress in many industries began to gain completely different dimensions. <br><br>  The boundaries between the real and the virtual world are becoming thinner, and in some directions they are almost indistinguishable.  Since eSports has recently been recognized as an official sport in Russia, beating all predicted popularity ratings, television is increasingly turning its attention towards bloggers who have a tenfold wider audience than some programs on central channels, and social networks have firmly entered our life, replacing live communication and the very need to go somewhere out of the house. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a2/820/8b9/4a28208b91fe0502ff4bb5a3b359ba66.jpg" alt="image">

      I myself have not watched TV for more than 12 years.  In the beginning, it was a necessary measure due to study abroad and the lack of access to the usual programs, and after that, the awareness of the possibility to choose on the Internet what and when to watch prompted the choice in favor of the latter.  Now it was not necessary to be attached to a specific time or date, as well as to watch hated ads for hours. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Now, I think, no one from the youth can imagine life without YouTube, Twitch, VK, Facebook or torrents at the worst.  Video content just flooded the World Wide Web.  Due to the cheapness of video cameras and the availability of digital media, the video production process turned into an easy walk, which, unfortunately, had a very serious impact on the quality of the content being filmed.  But let's not talk about sad things, but let's talk better about the basic principles and secrets of working with the YouTube site. <br><br>  When creating any video on YouTube, you need to be guided by 4 principles: the <i>idea, speed of production, quality, advertising</i> , and all this in that order. <br><br>  <b>Let's go through each of them:</b> <br><br>  <b>The idea</b> is that YouTube has a huge amount of diverse content, and this should be considered first of all.  Yes, you can just start doing something that you like, but in this case you need to get ready, that even after 2 years of hard work, the level of subscribers on the channel will not exceed a couple of thousand.  Now the competition on video hosting portals is enormous, and therefore you need your unique style or a distinctive feature, according to which people will immediately understand that it is you.  Another scenario is the search for a completely new format, but in this case you need to take into account that it can not "shoot" and you will waste time.  The best and least risky option is to search for unique popular ideas in the English-speaking sector and adapt them to our audience. <br><br>  <b>The speed of production</b> is not strange, but this factor is one of the determining factors on YouTube.  I personally witnessed how the channels with a fresh idea, began to produce videos almost every day, and quickly rose, gaining a target audience.  At the same time, the quality of video production was at an average or low level.  In this case, it is important to realize that you can not stand still and you need to constantly raise the bar of quality, otherwise your idea will be noticed, made better and will entice the audience. <br><br>  <b>Quality</b> - from recent times (last 4-5 years), due to the extensive popularization of YouTube, this aspect has become quite acute.  People spoiled by a good picture will simply not watch a badly recorded video, even if it is interesting or carries a positive message.  It is also worth thinking about the sound and buy at least a simple microphone, fortunately, in our time, you can find a lot of solutions on the market from the cheapest to the studio tube options.  Light and installation are also very important, but not so critical.  Over time, with the advent of the audience, and the advent of understanding how best to make a video, it will appear and know what equipment is needed and how to use it correctly. <br><br>  <b>Advertising</b> - there are a huge amount of options and ways to unwind your channel for money, but in order not to throw money away to the wind you need to understand a few simple truths: <br><br>  1) Adequately assess what you are doing and begin to engage in paid promotion only if you are 100% sure of the quality of the content. <br>  2) Do not spend money on cheating bots or clicks, since it still does not read out by Google (the service calculates the overall activity coefficient, which includes likes, dislikes, comments, therefore, subscribers' cheating has only a psychological character). <br>  3) Purchase advertising from bloggers from large channels with a loyal audience.  Advertising on channels with tops and non-original content will not be as effective. <br>  4) At the time of the advertising campaign, the activity on your channel should be maximized, especially if the large increase in new subscribers becomes permanent. <br><br>  At the end of the article I would like to mention the standard things that are important in positioning your video on YouTube, which are often forgotten by novice bloggers. <br><br>  1) The name of the video is better to choose based on the number of requests in search engines.  Similar statistics can be found on such a site as <a href="https://wordstat.yandex.ru/">yandex wordstat</a> and the like. <br>  2) For each video, it is desirable to write a detailed description with a set of keywords related to your video.  Each keyword must be used in the text at least three times. <br>  3) Fill in the tag field to the video. <br>  4) Make an interesting "preview" picture. <br>  5) Be sure to use playlists and annotations. <br><br>  Since our blog is being created as part of the e-sports project <a href="http://www.apeigaming.com/">APEIGAMING</a> , it would not be superfluous to mention that a few weeks ago we also launched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwBRksf3o-4vcQaRm2Cx7NA">our own channel</a> .  And although many people from our organization have a great store of knowledge and many years of experience working with youtube, each new format and each new project is like a step into the unknown - there is never 100% certainty that an idea will be accepted and understood by the viewer.  It only remains to work hard and raise the quality of content, because perfection has no limits. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396695/</a></p>
