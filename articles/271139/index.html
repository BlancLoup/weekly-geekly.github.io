Information about <a href="http://vds.menu/">VDS.menu</a> and <a href="http://shared.menu/">SHARED.menu</a> has already been placed on Habr√©.  Becoming the owner of these two sites, I decided to breathe life into them as much as possible.  In addition to these two sites, the domain dedicated.menu was attached.  After much deliberation, it was decided to combine these three domains under a single brand <a href="http://hosting.cafe/">HOSTING.cafe</a> - a cafe in which there are various hosting menus.  In addition to the existing domains, <a href="https.menu/">HTTPS.menu</a> , <a href="http://backup.menu/">BACKUP.menu</a> , LICENSE.menu were acquired.

      Recently, quite a lot of work has been done on improving existing sites and developing new ones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  <a href="http://vds.menu/">VDS.menu</a> and <a href="http://shared.menu/">SHARED.menu</a> </h1><br> <a href="http://vds.menu/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/630/9fc/6c6/6309fc6c6691446286b77d32fa23ed32.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://shared.menu/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc9/728/fed/dc9728fedb794a0cbf06b9a6af8f5d67.png"></a> <br><br>  On the virtual server and shared hosting search sites, the base with tariffs and hosters has been completely updated.  Unfortunately, due to lack of time, it was not yet possible to update the information on all hosters that were previously. <br><br>  The list of payment methods that are available during the search was also greatly expanded.  Now, any user will be able to choose a hoster with the desired method of payment. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Many payment methods</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Payment systems</b> <br><ul><li>  Bank card </li><li>  Yandex money </li><li>  Webmoney </li><li>  QIWI </li><li>  W1 </li><li>  Paypal </li><li>  Bitcoin </li><li>  Litecoin </li><li>  Liqpay </li><li>  Rapida </li><li>  OKPAY </li><li>  Payeer </li><li>  PerfectMoney </li><li>  RBKMoney </li><li>  EPESE </li><li>  Z-Payment </li><li>  Eleksnet wallet </li><li>  Unistream Money </li><li>  LEADER </li><li>  Paxum </li></ul><br>  <b>Internet banking</b> <br><ul><li>  Alpha click </li><li>  Russian standard </li><li>  Promsvyazbank </li><li>  Svyaznoy Bank </li><li>  Sberbank </li><li>  Faktura.Ru </li><li>  OCEAN BANK </li><li>  Privat24 </li><li>  Handybank </li><li>  Bank of Intesa </li><li>  Moscow Industrial Bank </li></ul><br>  <b>Payment terminals</b> <br><ul><li>  QIWI </li><li>  Eleksnet </li><li>  Novoplat </li></ul><br>  <b>Cell phone operators</b> <br><ul><li>  Megaphone </li><li>  Mts </li><li>  Beeline </li><li>  Tele 2 </li></ul><br>  <b>Money transfers</b> <br><ul><li>  Contact </li><li>  Unistream </li><li>  Post of Russia </li><li>  Western Union </li><li>  Anelik </li></ul><br>  <b>Salons of communication</b> <br><ul><li>  Svyaznoy </li><li>  Euroset </li><li>  DIXIS </li><li>  Cifrograd </li><li>  Cell world </li><li>  Forward mobile </li></ul><br>  <b>Bank transfers</b> <br><ul><li>  Rubles </li><li>  Dollars </li><li>  Euro </li><li>  Hryvnia </li></ul></div></div><br>  The search parameters interface has been improved - standard select boxes and checkboxes have disappeared, instead they are now using JavaScript counterparts, which are displayed equally in all browsers and fit the style of sites.  If earlier the user had to choose a value from a drop-down list of three items, now this list has been replaced by a more convenient option with radio boxes.  Thus, the number of clicks to get the desired result was significantly reduced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ac/a06/b36/4aca06b368df442a899f639c6022259b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fd/0ba/7d7/6fd0ba7d78fe46a0b03c2c1e5f45e681.png"><br><br>  Another improvement is the description of what data the hoster is requesting in order to be able to order a service from it.  Recently it became not so easy to buy a service from a hoster - someone asks for a phone, someone asks for a copy of a passport, etc. However, it‚Äôs possible to find out what the hoster requires only at the very last stage of the service acquisition.  Obviously, if at registration on the site of the host it would be indicated that the client would need to send a scan of the passport, they would be registered with less enthusiasm.  From now on, a potential client will know what the hoster will require from him even before going to his website.  Information is available on the host page or in the description of any tariff.  The search for this parameter is not conducted, so that ‚Äúbad people‚Äù find it harder to find a hoster without protection against fraudsters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/225/0ba/125/2250ba12598a424baeae1761a6a0d34c.png"><br><br>  Another improvement is related to the speed of finding the ideal tariff and hosting provider - now in order to ask the hosting company representative a question, it is not necessary to go to his website and look for a feedback form there, this can be done directly on the hosting page or the tariff description.  You need to fill in the name and e-mail, ask your question, after which the hoster will answer you by e-mail.  The function only works for hosters who have agreed to receive such letters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74b/584/184/74b5841846ab4c5a852754da6dc10b2c.png"><br><br>  In addition, some hosters have provided exclusive discount promo codes specifically for visitors Hosting Cafe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/802/312/874/80231287461f49e1b726ff2ea952f7a0.png"><br><br>  On the page of the description of the tariffs of virtual servers, changes also occurred - earlier the list of operating systems was comma-separated, so its viewing was somewhat difficult.  Now the list of OS is presented in the form of a separate block with icons of the operating systems themselves.  If desired, this unit can be minimized and then upon further review of tariffs, it will remain in this position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10d/ddc/02f/10dddc02f1104752a954bc3bd3b8bd83.png"><br><br>  A form has appeared for sending an error message in the tariff description.  You can only fill in the error description.  The form works without reloading the page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a1/4b9/cd5/9a14b9cd57ec4cc3b909691560268904.png"><br><br>  A block appeared with information on the date the tariff was added and the date of checking the current information. <br><br><h1>  <a href="http://backup.menu/">BACKUP.menu</a> </h1><br> <a href="http://backup.menu/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb0/55a/5e9/eb055a5e91de4c7a800ac4094e6673ef.png"></a> <br><br>  There is no need to describe why backup copies are needed, I‚Äôll just note that recently the service of providing storage for hosters has become increasingly popular, so it was decided to search for this service. <br>  Parameters for search by which you can find the tariff: <br><ul><li>  Disk capacity </li><li>  Amount of traffic </li><li>  Data link speed </li><li>  Price </li><li>  Data exchange protocols </li><li>  Country of server placement </li><li>  IPv6 support </li><li>  Payment Methods </li></ul><br>  The price ratio per gigabyte of space has been added to the standard sorting parameters, so you can find the cheapest place by limiting the top drive parameter. <br><br><h1>  <a href="https.menu/">Https.menu</a> </h1><br> <a href="https.menu/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea6/3b6/341/ea63b63418e34650813309fafe43f0a8.png"></a> <br><br>  SSL certificates have recently become more common, Google is increasing its position in issuing, scandals with data leaks or simply a desire to show care for users - one way or another the number of sites that use the https protocol will only increase.  Now there are free certificates, but they have significant limitations.  For example, the well-known StartSSl does not issue a certificate for commercial activities, therefore, for example, the owner of an online store will not be able to take advantage of this offer. <br><br>  Search for SSL certificates is currently in beta, so errors or miscalculations are possible when designing this site. <br><br>  Certificates are issued not by the hosters themselves, but by certification authorities, therefore the hoster acts only as an intermediary, providing the client with technical support and a more favorable price.  Therefore, the choice of SSL certificates for many hosters is about the same, although there are slight deviations from the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù.  Currently, only the most popular SSL certificates are used in the search, for which exact information on parameters has been collected (IDN support, subdomain support, etc.). <br><br>  The user can search for SSL certificates by the following parameters: <br><ul><li>  Price </li><li>  Brand - which certificate authority issues a certificate </li><li>  Verification method: when issuing a certificate, either only ownership of the domain name can be verified, or the domain and the organization that owns this domain are being verified </li><li>  IDN support - the ability to obtain a certificate for domains with non-English characters, for example, for domains in the zone. RF </li><li>  SGC Support (Server-Gated Cryptography) </li><li>  Support for subdomains (Wildard), when the certificate is issued not only for the domain itself, but also for all domains of the form * .domain.zone </li><li>  Multiple domains - it is possible to get one certificate for several different domains </li><li>  Extended Validation (EV, Extendet Validation) - certificates with extended validation, with a green bar in the browser </li><li>  Payment method </li></ul><br>  In the near future, sites will be launched to search for dedicated servers and licenses on the control panel.  Also in the near future I plan to make a more friendly design. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271139/</a></p>
