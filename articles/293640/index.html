Russian television advertising revenues decreased by 22%, radio - by 21%.  The outdoor advertising market fell by 27%.  Revenues of Internet companies from contextual advertising almost did not change.  In the first quarter, revenues from banner advertising fell by 18% to 2.8 billion rubles.  In the second quarter, the decline was only from 4 to 7% - to 4.3‚Äì4.4 billion rubles. <br><br>  The company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Yandex</a> in the second quarter increased its income from banner advertising by 9% at once - up to 848 million rubles. <a name="habracut"></a>  In Q1, search engine revenues in this segment decreased by 16% to 606 million rubles.

      The segment is formed by just a hundred advertisers, whose actions are very difficult to predict, in one month there may be a 10% increase, in the other - already a drop of the same 10%, said Yandex Finance Director Greg Abovski.  A spokesman for Yandex, Asya Melkumova, links this sharp rise with the increasing interest of large advertisers in media formats. <br><br>  This year, clients transferred their budgets to banner advertising from the first to the second quarter, leaving only the largest platforms in the portfolio, explains the director of one of the network advertising agencies.  Another RBC source in the advertising market <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/13/08/2015/55cca2609a79472a79b31970">recalled</a> that banner advertising on the Yandex home page and other sought-after positions is being sold by the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMHO_VI">IMHO VI</a> agency.  It is part of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE_%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BB">Video International</a> (Vi), the largest television advertising seller in the country.  "Yandex" works with many advertising agencies and does not disclose their contribution to the company's revenues, commented Melkumova.  In the second quarter, Yandex began to receive additional budgets from advertisers who agreed on their television advertising deals with Vi, the RBC source said. <br><br>  All other Internet sites, taken together, showed a worse dynamics than the entire segment.  According to RBC's calculations, the revenue of all other Runet sites from banner advertising in April ‚Äî June decreased by 7‚Äì10% to 3.5‚Äì3.6 billion rubles. <br><br>  The main competitor of Yandex in the online advertising segment is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail.Ru_Group">Mail.Ru Group</a> .  Its financial results for the second quarter will be published on August 20.  In the first quarter, Mail.Ru Group's total advertising revenues grew slower than the market.  They increased by only 3.4% - almost to 3 billion rubles.  The market for contextual and banner advertising grew by 9% - to 18.1 billion rubles. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù in the first quarter significantly outstripped the entire online advertising market: all advertising revenue grew by 12% - to 12 billion rubles.  In the second quarter, Yandex was ahead of the market with a total increase in advertising revenue by 13% - to 13.6 billion rubles. <br><br>  In late August, the search engine will abandon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_second-price_auction">GSP</a> auction on Yandex.Direct in favor of a VCG auction ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8">Vickrey</a> model), Vedomosti <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/07/30/602821-yandeks-po-novomu-prodast-kontekstnuyu-reklamu">reported</a> on July 30.
