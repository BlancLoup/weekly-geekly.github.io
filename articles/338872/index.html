    <h3>  " <a href="http://optimal-drive.ru/">Optimal movement</a> " </h3><br>  <b>What it is:</b> automation in the pharmaceutical industry - quality control systems for the execution of tasks, automatic calculation of the necessary parameters based on an innovative system of algorithms, automatic recording of solutions, applied volumetric flasks, and data collection from equipment in the control laboratories of pharmaceutical industries. <br><br>  <b>What is the point:</b> the company's solutions help unite a large number of monitoring tools: behind the premises (for example, monitoring and evaluating ventilation parameters in clean and conditionally clean rooms), employees (monitoring operations using NFC tags and QR codes), documentation , equipment maintenance and other production parameters. <br><br>  The project has no competitors in Russia and offers solutions several times cheaper than foreign analogues.  At the same time, the company's developments comply with GMP standards (international system of norms, rules and guidelines regarding production in the field of medicine and food industry), thanks to which they can be brought to markets throughout the world. <br><br>  <b>In the future: the</b> company <a href="http://technopark.ifmo.ru/rezident-tehnoparka-universiteta-itmo-vnedryaet-it-innovatsii-na-krupnejshie-farmproizvodstva/">plans</a> to enter the European market and is negotiating with Western partners to launch testing of the company's products at European manufactures. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Stress sensor </h3><br>  <b>What it is: a</b> complex of monitoring the state of the human cardiovascular system with a prognosis depth of 2-3 days.  The device performs the functions of a pulse oximeter and an electrocardiograph and provides an assessment of the state of human health, and in a form that is understandable to a layman.  Data received by the device can be accumulated and transferred to a PC / smartphone with specialized software. <br><br>  <b>What is the trick: the</b> main innovative component of the project is software, whose task is to predict changes in the state of the human cardiovascular system.  In particular, the device may respond to changes in fitness, increase / decrease in stress resistance, and may also note changes in the state of the body, not associated with an increase in load - this can be regarded as an alarm signal.  In addition, the gadget can collect information necessary for remote diagnostics of the user's health status - data can be sent for analysis to the attending physician. <br><br>  <b>In the future:</b> the project‚Äôs creators are confident that the project‚Äôs popularity among physicians will increase with the advent and spread of telemedicine centers, since the use of ‚Äúsensors‚Äù makes it easier to collect and transmit information about the patient‚Äôs condition, and in the long term, it will help reduce the state‚Äôs cost of conducting medical examinations data on the health of people in a given region. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  <a href="https://vismart.biz/">Vismart</a> </h3><br>  <b>What it is:</b> a software company in the field of the semantic web, including practical applications for semantic technologies (in particular, Ontodia applications).  Ontodia is used to display semantic data in the form of diagrams and graphs, with which you can easily visualize any data. <br><br>  <b>What is the point:</b> semantic technologies allow you to search for information not only by keywords, but also by the values ‚Äã‚Äãassociated with them, create logical links between these values ‚Äã‚Äãand visualize them in a format understandable to humans.  Thus, the system produces more accurate search results (rather than just a keyword search). <br><br>  However, as Dmitry Pavlov, commercial director of VISmart, notes, in the professional environment there are not many tools that allow using the possibilities of semantic technologies in practice. <br><br><blockquote>  Therefore, we decided to create a tool that will allow to visually represent semantic data in the form of interactive graphs. <br><br>  - Dmitry Pavlov, in an interview with ITMO.NEWS </blockquote><br>  After the semantic data is loaded into the program, the service compiles a graph from them, visualizes them and stores the resulting diagram: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f9BKdKrWWIk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>In the future: the</b> creators of the project are confident that semantic technologies will be increasingly used to analyze data and collect information.  One of the directions of future development in this area is the integration of different types of content (text, audio, video, charts) and their comprehensive analysis. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  <a href="https://adbooking.ru/">Adbooking</a> </h3><br>  <b>What it is: an</b> advertising exchange that brings together advertisers and owners of advertising space;  own network for demonstration of video advertising in public places;  content management system. <br><br>  <b>What is the trick:</b> the Adbooking project does not simply unite advertisers and platforms - the company develops hardware solutions and software for displaying advertising and managing advertising content.  For example, equipment for creating digital video advertising: <br><br><ul><li>  A microcomputer and Andriod OS based media player with a video signal switching system that allows the player to be used to intercept the signal from the main broadcast channel to the signal from the player for the duration of the advertisement (on the main broadcast channel). </li><li>  Advertising table tent - a tablet, mounted in a special case, allowing to install it on the table.  The table tent can work offline for up to 10 hours and can be equipped with additional cables and a power source that allows charging external devices such as mobile phones, tablets. </li><li>  The advertising mirror is a display mounted behind the mirror and placed in an aluminum case.  The visible area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe display inside the mirror can be either closed with a mirror film to create a mirror effect when the screen is off (50 to 80% reflection), or be completely transparent.  It can be used as a fully advertising-information device, or it can receive a signal from external sources, for example, IP-TV or a media player. </li><li>  Informational advertising screen for transport - a display in a vandal-proof and safety case that can be placed in a vehicle and used as a route board or for displaying advertising with remote control of content playback. </li></ul><br>  <b>In the future:</b> if everyone is already accustomed to WiFi networks in hotels and restaurants, there are not so many cases with free WiFi in public transport (except for the metro).  Therefore, Adbooking plans to develop a device and service to provide access to the Internet through an open WiFi network to vehicle passengers (free of charge in accordance with all registration requirements) with the possibility of displaying advertising content. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  <a href="http://factoryfinder.io/%3Flang%3Dru">FactoryFinder</a> </h3><br>  <b>What it is: an</b> online service for the effective work of the purchasing department, which allows you to automate the search and analysis of suppliers' offers, compare prices, delivery terms and conditions.  As a result, the company receives savings of up to 45% when choosing the best deals. <br><br>  <b>What is the point:</b> this resident of Technopark works as a global marketplace and this is different from the self-written solutions that companies develop to interact with their own suppliers.  Now the service brings together more than ten thousand suppliers, engineers and purchasers.  For each of them, the system conducts an audit of reliability - and does not allow to get into the "top" of profitable offers to suppliers who (by accident or intentionally) set incredibly low prices. <br><br>  This approach helps to deal with kickbacks within companies and to check procurement managers - whether or not they choose the most profitable offer from all possible.  By the way, sorting in this case can be conducted not only by price, but also by supplier reliability, as well as other conditions - for example, you can compare different suppliers taking into account different logistics costs.  The team continues to work on the project and make improvements to it: the current version of the system is the fourth. <br><br>  <b>In the future:</b> the project team continues to optimize the service and enter new product and geographical markets (to Europe and the USA). <br><br><hr><br><h3>  <a href="http://orbiprime.com/">Orbi prime</a> </h3><br>  <b>What it is: A</b> camera for shooting video of 360 degrees in the form factor of the glasses, as well as the technology of editing the video shot on such a gadget. <br><br><h3>  What is the trick: </h3>  Unlike other gadgets for shooting, Orbi Prime allows you to not use any additional mounts (just put on your glasses and you can start shooting) and shoot from the first person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cc/92/59cc9294753ff371520278.jpeg"><br><br><blockquote>  People who are watching the footage you literally fall into your place.  They get the opportunity to turn their heads and look at what you saw yourself, which you may not even have paid attention to. <br><br>  - Alexander Moreno, Project Technical Director, in an interview to ITMO.NEWS portal </blockquote><br>  In this case, glasses allow you to shoot video in a format up to 4k and lasting up to 90 minutes.  The viewing angle of the sphere obtained during the installation is 360 √ó 300 ¬∞, the gadget is synchronized with mobile devices via WiFi and has an IP64 protection class.  By the way, the function, in fact, sunglasses it is also provided. <br><br>  The team directed the main efforts in developing the device to create software that turns video glasses captured by glasses into a full-fledged panorama. <br><br>  <b>In the future:</b> at present, the prototype of the device is in production in the final design - it will be ready by mid-November of this year.  In the future, the project is counting on a collaboration with a brand for the production of glasses, and also plans to add the ability to share video in real time. <br><br>  This, as it turns out, is not such an easy task - as Alexander Moreno <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/startups_and_business/business_success/news/6536/">notes</a> : ‚ÄúFor livestream, you need to have a ready-made panorama at the output of the device, but the computing power of modern electronics does not allow doing this in the body of glasses.  Yes, while we are resting on the possibilities of technology, but we have already begun to work in this direction. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.service-gene.spb.ru/">ATG Service Gene</a> </h3><br>  <b>What it is: a</b> company that performs custom molecular biological experiments (oligonucleotide synthesis, DNA sequencing, gene synthesis, peptide synthesis, protein expression, and others).  Works with biological and pharmaceutical companies, state scientific organizations of Russia and the CIS. <br><br>  <b>What is the trick:</b> this company-resident Technopark ITMO has developed technology for the gene encoding of proteins responsible for therapeutic processes in the body.  With its help, the company creates gene therapy drugs to speed up regeneration, prolong wakefulness, slow down aging (human genes are injected that encode certain proteins necessary for various therapeutic purposes). <br><br>  One of their developments is a gene therapy analgesic, one dose of which is able to have an effect on the body for seven days (the term was chosen taking into account the need for prolonged anesthesia and possible tasks for subsequent treatment). <br><br><blockquote> In humans, there are proteins that are responsible for blocking pain, for example, some types of endorphins.  When the body is weakened, it cannot produce this protein in sufficient quantity.  If you enter into the body the DNA that encodes endorphin, then its production will increase, and the person will no longer feel pain.  Thus, we do not introduce a chemical substance into the body, especially from the morphine or opioid series. <br><br>  - Ilya Dukhovlinov, founder of ATG Service Gene [ <a href="http://technopark.ifmo.ru/rezident-tehnoparka-vuza-razrabotal-tehnologiyu-dlya-uskoreniya-regeneratsii-prodleniya-bodrstvovaniya-i-zamedleniya-stareniya/">source</a> ] </blockquote><br>  The drug is injected by intramuscular injection - the DNA encoding endorphin enters the muscle tissue, resulting in a new focus of endorphins production in the body, which is active for a week. <br><br>  <b>In the future: the</b> company plans to patent the development at the international level.  To date, patents have been received in Russia, USA, Japan and Brazil. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  <a href="http://parseq.pro/ru">Parseq lab</a> </h3><br>  <b>What it is: a</b> company developing solutions for molecular genetic diagnostics (for example, for the detection of hereditary diseases). <br><br>  <b>What is the trick:</b> at first the company was engaged exclusively in the creation of reagents for biochemical studies.  According to the results of such studies, the specialist received data that require further careful processing and decoding.  As a result, the company came to create a comprehensive product that allows you to conduct research and correctly interpret its results. <br><br>  For example, a test system for detecting genetic diseases in newborns is used both in Russia and abroad, and turns out to be cheaper than alternative methods. <br><br>  In this case, the child takes a blood sample, on the basis of which the genome is sequenced (decoding the sequence of the DNA molecule within the gene that determines the formation of the disease).  The analysis allows to determine the clinically significant mutations: you can identify about 500 different options for deviation from the norm. <br><br>  <b>In the future:</b> this project has passed clinical trials in European laboratories and can be officially used as a diagnostic solution not only in Russia, but also in the EU.  At the moment, the company is preparing new developments that are in the process of designing and testing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338872/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338872/</a></p>
