The event takes place as part of the NASA incubation program, so everyone is serious: participants will be provided with scientific data and NASA resources, satellites, space probes and other assets. <br><br>  Hackathon is held for the second time, last year it was attended by 25.000 enthusiasts from 187 countries.  This year in Moscow it is organized by the largest Russian-speaking community of hackathon members <a href="http://russianhackers.org/">Russian Hackers</a> . <br><br>  Participants will have to unite for 48 hours with developers, designers, scientists, and with everyone who wants to make the world a better place.

Approximately 40 million of these people are Internally Displaced People (IDP), since they remain inside their country borders.  This is a quotation of the asylum. <br><br>  Many of the IDPs and refugees were settling in unplanned, usually rural settlements.  It is not a rule.  This is a little bit more information about environmental issues, land-based opportunities (eg, local access to water, firewood, and food), and environmental challenges. <br><br> Remote sensing imagery collected by NASA satellites and instruments, such as Landsat, MODIS, GRACE, VIIRS, and others, capture an abundance of data related to environmental and climatic conditions, infrastructural change, and nighttime lighting conditions, as well as the multi-year and potentially multi-decadal changes therein. These data can thus give unique insights, and can help to improve global awareness of living conditions at informal settlements, which are home to ever-increasing populations of displaced people around the world. <br><br> Your challenge is to design an approach that uses NASA Earth observations data to characterize land cover/land use conditions at informal settlements. <br><br> Your approach should be: <br><br><ul><li> Scalable (ie, appropriate for application to several settlements), </li><li> Sensitive to the local geography and climate, and </li><li> Easily understandable for the residents, humanitarians, policy makers, scientists, and others who are committed to the welfare of vulnerable populations </li></ul><br><br><h3> Potential Considerations </h3><br> Your approach could include many kinds of assessments, such as (but not limited to): <br><br><ul><li> Tracking changes in agricultural or garden greenspace within or surrounding informal settlements; </li><li> Tracking changes in nighttime lights emissions; </li><li> Estimating fuel-wood consumption around the settlement; </li><li> Measuring changes in groundwater; and/or </li><li> Tracking changes in local land cover to identify the specific date when the settlement was established. </li></ul><br><br> These are merely suggestions. You are not required to take on all, or any, of the above, but rather you are encouraged to have a targeted question and application, even if some uncertainty or limitations remain. <br><br> Your approach may not be consistently effective across a variety of landscapes populated by informal settlements. That is okay!
