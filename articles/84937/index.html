It ended in my favor, but not without surprise. <br>  At the moment I have 99 stars on eBay and this is not my first purchase, which never came into my hands, but I didn‚Äôt have to open a case for each. <br><br>  I want to tell about this experience and similar cases. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In total, I did not receive 4 parcels - 2 from England and one each from the USA and Hong Kong. <br><br>  From the first, everything was simple enough.  From England, parcels usually came to me in 5-10 days.  And so, after 3 weeks, I asked the seller when he sent me the goods <i>(for there were cases of delays in sending up to a week)</i> .  The seller answered and asked to wait a little bit more.  After 2 weeks the parcel was still not there, I informed the seller about it and he replied that he could return the money or send a replacement.  I chose the money and everything remained with positive feedback. <br><br>  The second time communication with the seller was not so successful.  I was answered to the second or third letter also with a delay of several days.  This time I acted the same way - 3 weeks after the payment I specified the date of shipment and, after a month, I notified the seller that I had not received the goods.  But since  With the pace of the seller‚Äôs responses, everything could take a long time, I opened a dispute in the eBay Resolution Center.  The money was returned, but I did not have time to make a gift to my brother in the DR :( <br><br>  And in December last year, there were 2 more cases.  To begin with, it is simpler. <br>  My friend and I decided to test the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/73357/">keyboard cleaning gel</a> personally.  The Chinese had a lot of offers, so they chose a cheaper rating from someone, paid, we wait.  Parcels usually go for 2-3 weeks from China.  Closer to NG, I, as always, specify the date of dispatch, just in case, but I decide that in view of the holidays it is worth waiting at least 4 weeks, or even 5. But here's the ill luck - right after NG I receive a package from China with the goods ordered a week later than this gel.  I reported this to the seller and he replied that if the parcel did not arrive in a week, he would return the money.  A week later, the situation has not changed and then the seller begins to mischievous.  First he says that he will return the money, it takes 3-4 days and I ask ‚Äúwhen?‚Äù, To which I get an answer ‚Äúin 2 weeks‚Äù <i>(After 60 days from the date of purchase, it becomes very difficult to solve such questions on eBay, not to mention that it becomes impossible to leave feedback)</i> .  I climb into the help and find that the seller must return the money within 3 days after he promised to do it.  I reminded the seller about this, while threatening to open a dispute if he did not make a refund within 2 days.  He returned the money, and then I bought the gel and already received it from another seller. <br><br>  And here's the last thing ... A musician friend asked me to order <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE">tremolo</a> on eBay, he found it, brought money and a motivating drink, all I could do was order and pay, which was done.  All this happened in early December and, by analogy with the Chinese order, I decided that we would hardly get anything before NG.  After that, I began to clarify the situation with sending in more detail and the seller tells me that online tracking is often buggy on USPS, so it‚Äôs impossible to track the package.  Ukrposhta also failed to figure out anything, although I hadn‚Äôt tried to check before, so I can‚Äôt say anything about the adequacy of this service.  In general, the seller begins to swear that they all sent and promises to deal with the USPS.  A week goes by, to my question I again get the answer that they are still trying to figure it out.  Total, from the moment of payment, a month and a half has passed.  Another week goes by without changes.  I am already very uncomfortable in front of a friend, and, remembering the 60-day limit, I decide to open a case.  The seller asks for another week to wait.  The general term is already five minutes to two months; the seller does not respond to an open case, but he writes to me that I have not opened a case in vain - now they say we won't find out anything, let eBay decide.  Well, they took the initiative ... The Resolution Center took over. <br>  In a week I get the answer: <br><blockquote>  <b>Refund information:</b> <br>  A refund of $ 57.45 has been issued to your PayPal account. <br>  <b>Final decision:</b> <br>  This case has been decided in your favor. <br>  <b>eBay Customer Support comments:</b> <br>  "Case closed." <br></blockquote><br>  Hooray!  Finally, all this is over.  But a week goes by and there is no money.  In the form of an appeal, I add to the case a message stating that I still have not received the money, to which I received a reply from the Resolution Center, which usually happens within 7-10 days.  And today we received a letter from eBay that they regret that such a situation occurred with this purchase and that they return the money in the form of a coupon for a discount on the entire cost of this failed purchase.  Those.  Now I have a magaskid for $ 57.45 for a single payment for one product and its delivery, the discount is valid for 5 years.  Not exactly what I wanted, but better than nothing. <br><br>  I hope the above cases will be useful to someone, but to someone just interesting. <br><br>  <b>Upd.</b>  Another letter came from the Resolution Center in which they explain why they gave me a coupon, not money. <br><blockquote>  After reviewing your PayPal account <br>  received your refund because you are in paypal calls a "send-only" <br>  country. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Please note: if you have received <br>  seller directly refunded account through your <br>  original transaction for the payment.  Our refunds can't be <br>  I am sending you a payment <br>  transaction, not as an actual refund. </blockquote><br>  Because  the money was sent not by the seller, but directly, then this is not considered a refund and, due to the peculiarities of the PayPal account, cannot be credited to it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84937/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84937/</a></p>
