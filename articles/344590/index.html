  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AI systems in 2018: six predictions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the Gartner Symposium in Cape Town, Brian Burke, vice president and head of research, <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/data-center/gartner-2018-technology-trends.html">said</a> that of popular trends, it is artificial intelligence (AI) that will significantly affect all areas of our lives. <br><br>  According to him, the attitude to the technologies of artificial intelligence can be compared to the attitude to electricity 100 years ago.  Both inventions are aimed at improving and simplifying various processes, so the AI ‚Äã‚Äãsystems predict a great future. <br><br>  Next, we look at the trends in artificial intelligence and how technology will affect Big Data, business, security, virtual infrastructure, and everyday life in the coming year.

Big data will become more accessible. </h2><br>  According <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-internet-of-things-and-big-data-unlocking-the-power/">to</a> IDC and EMC, global data will reach 40 zettabytes by 2020, and, according to a Veritas <a href="https://www.veritas.com/news-releases/2016-03-15-veritas-global-databerg-report-finds-85-percent-of-stored-data">study</a> , 85% of this amount will be <a href="https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/dark-data">Dark Data</a> and <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ROT-redundant-outdated-trivial-information">ROT</a> .  Dark Data - unstructured data (mail, images, audio) that the company stores, but does not use.  ROT - electronic documents that the organization keeps "just in case" and also does not involve. <br><br>  However, analysts <a href="https://www.smartdatacollective.com/5-big-data-trends-that-will-change-ai-in-2018/">argue</a> that with the introduction of AI technologies, a business will be able to benefit from this information.  Analyzing such data, according <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-you-should-devote-as-much-time-to-dark-data-as-big-data/">to</a> Mads Hansen, product and solution manager at Targit, will allow companies to better understand their faults and learn from mistakes.  And as James Pine <a href="https://www.inc.com/james-paine/5-ai-trends-to-know-in-2018.html">claims</a> , founder of West Realty Advisors, AI will bring Big Data to the masses and completely change the way big data is processed. <br><br>  However, the Forrester agency <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/rethink-ai-in-2018-or-risk-failing/">notes</a> that in 2018, companies will have to carefully plan for the introduction of artificial intelligence systems and work with big data.  Otherwise, instead of benefits, these technologies will bring only losses and problems. <br><br><h2>  2. The speed of application and service delivery will increase. </h2><br>  According <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2017/12/03/ai-headed-2018/">to</a> Mark Edgar (Marc Edgar), the chief computer science researcher at GE Research, for the next 3‚Äì5 years, in-depth training will reduce software development time from a few months to a few days.  This will lead to improved functional characteristics, increased developer productivity and reduce the cost of the product. <br><br>  An example of such a system is <a href="http://automl.info/">AutoML</a> , a solution that <a href="http://usblogs.pwc.com/emerging-technology/top-10-ai-tech-trends-for-2018/">automates the</a> design of machine learning models.  Next year, experts expect the growth of the popularity of AutoML commercial packages and the integration of AutoML into large machine learning platforms. <br><br>  Gartner vice president David Kirley (David Cearley) <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/data-center/gartner-2018-technology-trends.html">notes</a> that the MoD is gradually becoming the basis for many applications and services.  One of the recent studies of the company shows that 59% of organizations collect information necessary for the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies, and 40% of companies are already introducing AI systems or launching pilot versions. <br><br><h2>  3. The quality of services will increase </h2><br>  According <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2017/11/28/51-artificial-intelligence-ai-predictions-for-2018/7/">to</a> Bryan Chagoly, vice president of information technology at Bazaarvoice, machine learning and AI systems will help marketers determine the behaviors, preferences and intentions of customers.  This will allow companies to introduce personalized services. <br><br>  AI capabilities will also gain popularity in technical support services.  For example, IBM <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-transforms-helpdesk-experience-with-watson-300436545.html">plans to</a> use Watson to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-ibm-wants-to-use-watson-to-speed-up-it-help-desk-support/">speed up the</a> work of the support: automating the solution of incidents, collecting and processing data and supporting users 24/7. <br><br><h2>  4. Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãattacks will become ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù (as well as protection systems against them) </h2><br>  This year, the IT community has become convinced that attackers are becoming more sophisticated.  Deepak Dutt, founder and CEO of Zighra, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hackers-have-already-started-to-weaponize-artificial-in-1797688425">argues</a> that using AI can help conduct more accurate and effective cyber attacks: collect personal data on social networks and use them for hacking, phishing, searching for vulnerabilities, and so on. <br><br>  According <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hackers-have-already-started-to-weaponize-artificial-in-1797688425">to</a> Mark Goodman (Marc Goodman), author of the book ‚Äú <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Future-Crimes-Everything-Connected-Vulnerable/dp/0385539002">Future Crimes,</a> ‚Äù such crimes have already <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/05/03/botnets-deep-web/">begun</a> , and if they are strengthened with AI systems, it will be very difficult to defend against them.  Is that with other intelligent solutions. <br><br>  According <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2017/11/28/51-artificial-intelligence-ai-predictions-for-2018/7/">to</a> Phil Tully and Zack Allen from ZeroFox, next year, organizations will have to think about more robust security mechanisms than two-factor authentication.  Enterprises will have to implement and scale automated protection systems to detect threats and suspicious behavior.  For example, for the "defense" of the cloud environment, Oracle offers a <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/security-analytics">Security Monitoring and Analytics</a> solution that, according to the company, allows you to quickly detect, investigate and eliminate the widest range of security threats. <br><br><h2>  5. AI systems will enter everyday life. </h2><br>  According <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2017/12/03/ai-headed-2018/">to</a> Georges Nahon, CEO of Orange Silicon Valley, artificial intelligence systems and biometric indicators recognition will be used to make payments in stores and ensure security at secure sites. <br><br>  For example, HSBC customers in China <a href="http://www.hsbc.com/news-and-insight/insight-archive/2017/selfies-are-the-latest-way-to-pay">can</a> already confirm payment using selfies, and the Speech Technology Center offers a Vizier biometric system <a href="https://www.speechpro.ru/product/sistemy-biometricheskogo-kontrolya-dostupa-ucheta-i-poiska/vizir">that</a> can recognize the faces of all people caught in the video camera's field of view.  Nahon <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2017/12/03/ai-headed-2018/">argues</a> that soon our credit card, driver's license and other documents will replace our face. <br><br>  At the same time, Peter Walquist (Peter Wallqvist), vice president of strategy at iManage, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2017/11/28/51-artificial-intelligence-ai-predictions-for-2018/5/">believes</a> that AI technology in 2018 will become more practical, help people solve specific business problems, increase productivity and open up new opportunities. <br><br><h2>  6. Virtual Infrastructure Will Get More Features. </h2><br>  Advances in AI will lead to the emergence of new cloud tools.  Horia Margarit, chief analyst at Qubole, is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2017/11/28/51-artificial-intelligence-ai-predictions-for-2018/3/">confident</a> that innovative solutions will soon be available that will speed up data collection, increase computing power and simplify the integration of virtual infrastructure. <br><br>  Some of these developments are already available on the market.  Machine learning is used in VMware's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1z4K-tH-BCc">vRealize Log Insight</a> product to automatically collect data on a virtual infrastructure.  Also, machine learning algorithms are used in the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/appdefense.html">AppDefense</a> solution, which provides end-device security by automatically responding to detected threats.  Another example is IBM, which uses machine learning to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/workload-automation">load balance</a> the IBM Cloud. <br><br>  As Bob Evans, CEO of Evans Strategic Communications, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2017/12/04/cloud-computing-outlook-2018-the-top-10-predictions-for-winning-the-cloud-wars">noted</a> , providers will need to help customers implement new technological solutions, including artificial intelligence systems, to get the most out of their cloud environment. <br><br><hr><br>  PS Our materials on how to use virtual infrastructure: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/luchshie-praktiki-migracii-i-razvertyvaniya-infrastruktury-v-oblake-iaas/">Best Practices for Migrating and Deploying IaaS Cloud Infrastructure</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/resheniya/migraciya-mezhdu-oblakami-c-ispolzovaniem-instrumentov-vmware/">Migration between clouds using VMware tools: why and how</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/bezopasnost/postroenie-attestuemyx-i-zashhishhennyx-infrastruktur-na-baze-reshenij-vmware/">VMware Solutions: Building Certified and Protected Infrastructures</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344590/</a></p>
