  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Can traffic be unlimited?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now the vast majority of hosting sites offer services with the provision of unlimited traffic.  Is it really?  Can traffic really be unlimited? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First of all, a little about what traffic is.  The definition of traffic in a computer technology is the amount of information transmitted over the network.  When you visit your website or request files located on your site, a certain amount of information is transmitted to the visitor - this is incoming traffic towards the user and outgoing towards the server. <br><br>  When you upload information to the site, this is outgoing traffic towards you and incoming for the server.  Monthly traffic is the sum of incoming and outgoing traffic.  When a hosting provider talks about the charging of traffic, then we are talking about traffic relative to the server.

      <br>
      It is important to understand that visitors to your site generate both outbound and inbound traffic.  But outgoing traffic in this case will always be large.  Incoming traffic can exceed outbound if you often upload information to the site in large volumes.  Thus, the more visitors on the site - the more traffic, and first of all outgoing.  The more files you download to the site, the more expensive incoming traffic.  Most often, incoming traffic is more expensive than outgoing.  Often outgoing traffic is not paid at all. <br><br>  So can traffic be unlimited?  Here you need to understand that for the hosting provider the traffic of your site is not free.  It has its cost price.  And if a company providing hosting services, like any commercial company, strives to be profitable, then it is important for it that the money you paid should exceed the cost of services rendered to you.  This cost includes traffic.  Therefore, hosting - provider does not care what traffic generates your site. <br><br>  In reality, hosting companies write in their price lists that they have unlimited traffic, but in fact this is not the case, there are reasonable limits.  The fact is that as soon as your website rolls up, and many visitors go to you, who will start to generate significant traffic, you will find out that there is absolutely no unlimited traffic.  Why does not happen?  Because, no matter how your server is connected to the Internet, everything always comes up against the width of the channel.  And more than your hosting channel just physically can not pump traffic. <br><br>  There are several possible options for the hosting provider.  Some providers simply find that ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù traffic should not exceed a certain limit (for example, 15Gb).  If you exceed this limit more often, you just have to pay extra, or your website will simply be disabled.  So, the traffic turns out to be unlimited, but if you exceed the limit, you have to pay.  More cunning providers simply suggest switching to a more expensive tariff, under the pretext that your site uses too many server resources.  The fact is, you can‚Äôt check the load on the server, unlike traffic.  So, in this case, it remains only to either switch to a more expensive tariff, or change the host.  Although of course, if you use self-written content management systems, or use third-party developments, there is probably a system for metering memory and processor time.  For example, how many pages are generated and how many queries are performed to the database.  One more thing that will help us determine how much load on the hosting is created, this is a statistics system.  Do not be lazy to analyze your server web logs and see how many visitors actually come to you.  Of course, you can put a counter of visitors, the blessing in runet is full of them, but do not forget that there are people who go to sites without using JavaScript and not uploading pictures.  For example, your buyers from mobile phones, when they just need to specify the address of your store.  And now knowing how many people visit our site and how much memory is needed to generate pages, we can accurately calculate how much we are putting on the load on the hosting. <br><br>  In short, companies offering unlimited traffic rely on the fact that your resource will not be heavily visited and traffic will simply be small.  Otherwise, you still have to pay. <br><br>  Another trick that is used by hosting companies is the ratio of traffic.  In runet, the most popular scheme is that in which the ratio of incoming traffic to outbound traffic does not exceed 1: 4.  The total volume of foreign incoming traffic does not exceed the total volume of Russian incoming traffic and the total volume of foreign outgoing traffic does not exceed the total volume of Russian outgoing traffic.  Either the total volume of foreign traffic is also correlated with the total volume of Russian traffic, like 1: 4, or only 10% of foreign traffic is allowed.  When choosing a hosting company, pay attention to this, usually these items are written finely and not legibly, and sometimes they are not written at all. <br><br>  But we understand that there is no unlimited traffic, it has not and will not.  On average, even a large visited resource consumes no more than 30-40 GB of traffic and less often.  On this and calculated.  And more traffic is difficult to create without making a file archive and high load, which, by the way, is stipulated in the rules.  Companies do not limit customers and their sites, but if they are file archives, they will offer you to review the terms of the agreement and offer tariffs with paid traffic. <br><br>  How, then, choose a hosting?  First of all, calculate how much traffic your site can generate.  If the traffic is small, then you can not worry about this parameter at all.  Carefully read the terms of service on the site host.  Pay attention to all details and reservations related to traffic.  In most cases, the conditions for sites knowingly generating a lot of traffic (all sorts of file archives) are negotiated separately.  In addition, if the amount of traffic is important to you, it is useful to ask the corresponding question to the support service, and also to make sure that this item is registered in the contract. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.rhosting.ru/3">www.rhosting.ru/3</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19974/</a></p>
