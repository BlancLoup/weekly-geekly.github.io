  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Memory cards</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, sitting at work, I couldn‚Äôt force myself to start doing something, I stupidly surfed the Internet, and suddenly I understood the reason why I absolutely don‚Äôt want to work: I have mess in my head, I got confused.  The decision came about by itself.  In order to motivate yourself, it is necessary that the information with which you have to work was organized, and the process of organization was interesting.  My choice was to try to portray the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%258B_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">memory cards</a> that I read about in the book of Allen David (the notorious GTD), as well as in a <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/04/list-of-applications-that-use-google.html">recent review of</a> services that support <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a> , and this service is called <a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/">Mind Meister</a> . <br>  Searching on Habr√©, I did not find a word about memory cards, or mind mapping, so I think this tool will be interesting to many. <br>  As Wikipedia says, memory cards (Mind map) are a way of depicting the process of general systems thinking using diagrams.  It can also be considered as a convenient alternative recording technique.  Below is an example of such a scheme: <br><br>  Memory mapping is a tool that is very useful in brainstorming.  The meaning of memory cards is to draw a tree describing the problem, at the root of which there is the problem itself, from which the branches originate - solutions to the problem.  The big advantage of this approach is that all possible approaches to solving the problem are taken into account and displayed on the map.  Such a map will very quickly be able to remind a person all the details of solving a problem; for this, just a glance at the map and keywords in the tree nodes will help to restore the overall picture in consciousness.  You can draw a memory card with a pencil on paper, however, it will be more convenient for many to do it while sitting at a computer (my handwriting has already deteriorated, since I have hardly written by hand since my student days).  There are enough desktop applications for working with memory cards, but in the web 2.0 era, I chose the Mind Meister service for myself.  From its merits I would like to note: <br><br>  - Convenient interface.  You can work using only the keyboard, hot keys are almost intuitive. <br>  - possibility of teamwork with cards <br>  - Uploading a map to PDF format, as well as to several formats for desktop applications for working with memory cards. <br>  - printout directly from the browser. <br>  - support for Google Gears, i.e.  the ability to work offline <br>  - promised to release a mobile version (for iPhone) <br>  - the ability to set the card nodes priority and execution time <br>  - the ability to insert external links.

      For the sake of fairness, it is necessary to list and drawbacks: <br>  - paid version of the pro (what's the opportunity?) <br>  - the impossibility of multiple inheritance. <br>  - there is a task execution time, but there is no notification <br><br>  I learned about memory cards from the book of Allen David (GTD), and decided to try this method, having understood that it was demotivating me.  I realized that I did not want to work because I was confused about what to do.  Systematization of information helps to focus on something specific, throwing out the rest of the head. <br>  I hope my review will help someone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24736/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24736/</a></p>
