  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CMS Textpattern development and who needs it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It just so happened that every sandpiper praises its own bog.  So today I would like to compliment Textpattern, my favorite content management system, which I have not been able to part with for the past 6 years. <br>  It all started like the majority with the hobby of web.  In the late nineties there was no normal system with which it would be easy and easy to bungle a site for oneself or a client.  More precisely were, but some unfinished and raw.  The market has evolved. <br>  Having tried about a hundred of such systems, PHP-Nuke left a bright memory of itself - at that time it was good, but, unable to withstand the pressure of younger systems, it went into the shadows, moved to Joomla and Drupal - they seemed somewhat complicated ... There were many more systems and frameworks having established that they lived on localhost no more than a couple of days. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  As a result, stopped at the popular and now Wordpress.  He managed to make a couple of serious projects, but he didn‚Äôt manage to get this monster to be at least a little fast without a very long process of optimizing the code, checking each plug-in, putting things in order. <br>  At about the same time as Wordpress was disappointed, I discovered Textpattern.  I was then looking for a system with which the creation of a typical website would take two or three days with a ready layout.  I tried.  First impressions of Textpattern - austerity and simplicity of admin panel, but at the same time, everything is logical and sufficient for work.  The first site on it, I did, of course, not two days.  But the process went, I was involved.  And hooked!  My personal record - I managed to raise a site on it in 2 hours!  Plus, four regional portals are currently working on it (one of them previously worked on Wordpress). <br>  The Internet has grown.  Ros and I professionally.  Grew up and developed Textpattern. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76a/73c/086/76a73c0863e726f65bde66b9d7cba707.png" alt="Textpattern Logo"><br>  Over the years, he has retained all his advantages, covering all his weaknesses along the way.  The delights of Textpattern are numerous: <br>  - due to the fact that it is all written by functions, it is extremely fast and easy.  From my experience with Wordpress, I remember that he was about 60 meters to generate a page without caching, and about 30 to 40 meters with a cache.  Textpattern takes up 5-10 megabytes of memory (!) Without any cache.  This allows you to quickly deliver content, and not load the hosting on a loaded project. <br>  - Easy to customize the design and structure.  Textpattern went on its path of development - this is his strength and his weakness.  The code of the site pages is not stored in separate files, such as Wordpress, or Smarty, but is ruled in the admin area and is stored in the database.  At first glance, this complicates the rise of the finished template (in the same Wordpress, you can simply copy the template to the hosting), but in practice it greatly simplifies editing and debugging.  That saves a lot of time and effort in the end. <br><br><h5>  Benefits of Textpattern: </h5><br>  - Textpattern supports out of the box ALL existing languages!  No need to rename anything - everything is already working in the language you speak. <br>  - Naturally there is and works well CNC <br>  - A large number of plug-ins and an active community.  For Textpattern developed more than one hundred serious plug-ins, one way or another extending its functionality. <br>  - distribution of roles and rights of users. <br>  - serious breaking resistance, stability and reliability.  If you do not have any holes on the server, or an evil virus on your work computer, then it will be almost impossible to hack your site!  Textpattern itself is superbly protected. <br>  - ease of development and support of the site.  I have several projects that are supported by real, classic blondes.  Even with them, normal flight. <br>  - simple writing plugins.  With normal knowledge of php, learn how to write good plugins for Textpattern for 1-2 months.  Having dealt with the internal logic and structure of Textpattern, everything becomes simple and elegant.  The code at Textpattern is beautiful, logical and easy to understand.  The more you delve into the logic of developers, the more you immerse yourself in PHP Zen. <br><br><h5>  There are also disadvantages: </h5><br>  - your markup language - Textile.  Personally, the usual html is convenient for me.  The developers decided otherwise, which discourages a lot of users from the CMS.  But there is a simple way out - there is a plugin that allows you to switch work to the classic WYSIWYG editor (plugin hak_tinymce). <br>  - inserting an image out of the box, or a gallery into an article, forces you to work with copy-paste (it is solved by plug-ins, for example, ku_image_uploader). <br>  - weak functionality for working with site users.  There is no normal plugin for registration / personal account. <br>  - It is difficult to make an online store.

    <h5>  So for whom is Textpattern suitable? </h5><br>  If your project is primarily informational and at least you know what html tags are, then Textpattern for you is Klondike of features! <br>  For freelancers - a way to quickly and easily develop a project. <br>  For fans - the ability to make a resource that is easy to set up and difficult to crack. <br>  I'd add that I finally decided to post my own work on the network and make an assembly in the near future, making the Textpattern out of the box simple for a teapot.  Accepted requests for specific improvements. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203360/</a></p>
