When a whole is assembled from a multitude of particulars, you can get a true picture that will allow you to objectively assess the situation and make an informed decision.  In online advertising, synthesis has now become a key process - this is due to the fragmentation of the placement channels of campaigns, for which statistics need to be collected and analyzed.  Only aggregation of all data helps the advertiser to select the most effective promotion channels and make the right management decision.  However, importing data from various sources is one of the most problematic issues in online advertising and is leaving it, leaving a scattered pool of data.  Such an approach is tantamount to walking around a relief area with tightly blind eyes - injury is inevitable. <br><br> <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/realweb/blog/18090/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d3/359/13e/2d335913e24b4af593bca6362ad7fbf5.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you ask <a href="http://www.realweb.ru/">RealWeb</a> employees which web analytics tool they consider the best, they will surely be called Google Analytics in the first place.  Indeed, it is a powerful system that allows you to analyze traffic, know everything about your website and website or online store revenue, includes incredibly cool features for e-commerce and comprehensive analysis.  As a rule, an advertising manager establishes a link between AdWords accounts and Google Analytics and can measure and analyze key metrics through the channel.  However, advertisers are often not limited to placing ads on Google AdWords, but give it on different channels: on social networks, on Yandex, Bing (Yahoo, MSN) sites, etc ... <br><br>  Advertising without analytics and assessing its effectiveness - money thrown to the wind.  Even if you observe sales growth and profitability during the work of advertising campaigns, this is a very subjective feeling - the business does not know which channel brought the most revenue and in which it should be additionally invested to achieve new profit peaks.  Many people ask the question - why do you need to aggregate data from all advertising sites?

    <ul><li>  To effectively measure the result, all data will be collected by channels and it will be possible to calculate totals and ROI for all advertising activities on the Internet. <br><br></li><li>  To analyze all advertising and SEO activities in order to distribute the weights of each source in the formation of the company's income (loss). <br><br></li><li>  To be able to unify data and compare performance across similar entities: ads, ad groups, campaigns, etc ... <br><br></li><li>  For the calculation of indicators that are not available on any site. <br><br></li><li>  To unify access and work in a single user-friendly interface without the need for manual data collection. <br><br></li><li>  To calculate the planned advertising costs, forecasting advertising and marketing budgets. <br><br></li><li>  For a visual demonstration of statistics on advertising campaigns on the Internet. <br></li></ul><br>  Scattered advertising campaigns require thorough analysis and, above all, data comparison - you need to know exactly which channel is more cost-effective.  and what needs to be recycled or closed.  There are many ways to combine data - almost every manager working with site analytics has its own secrets.  Someone uses aggregators, someone manually collects and analyzes data in MS Excel and MS Access files.  We in <a href="http://www.realweb.ru/">RealWeb</a> work with a huge number of client ad campaigns, so we prefer to use reliable tools, which we will tell a little about. <br><br>  <a href="http://adhands.ru/auth/login"><b>AdHands</b></a> - a functional dashboard of its own design RealWeb.  This is a system that connects to online advertising sites (Yandex.Direct, Yandex.Market, Google Adwords, Vkontakte, Target@Mail.ru, DoubleClick Bid Manager, Yandex.Auction, etc.) via an API.  We already wrote about it on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/realweb/blog/262573/">Habr√©</a> from a technical point of view.  From the perspective of an external user, this is an excellent aggregator for collecting information from many advertising accounts.  By collecting data in the AdHands interface, the user can easily compare metrics and calculate the performance indicators of advertising channels.  The system successfully solves the problem of discrepancies between entities (for example, the names of the same campaign components at different sites) and helps to assess the ROI of advertising placements on the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bba/a40/2e2/bbaa402e21a84eb199bf36cdb27a2c7e.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://supermetrics.com/"><b>Supermetrics</b></a> is a service that helps customize data downloads from sites: Twitter, Facebook, SEMrush, YouTube, Bing Ads, and many others.  Supermetrics can be presented as a solution for various platforms: <br><br><ul><li>  Supermetrics Data Grabber - automatically collects data in specially designed MS Excel files.  You upload the Excel file for the version of Office that is installed in your workplace and with the help of a perfectly organized menu and customized macros you collect data, get their analysis and graphical representation. <br><br></li><li>  Supermetrics for Google Drive is a tool that connects to Google Drive and works with Google Docs tables or text files.  A powerful solution for those who are accustomed to the online editor and prefer to work in a single workspace. <br><br></li><li>  Supermetrics Functions is a solution for advanced users of Excel, which are quite a bit among analysts of advertising campaigns.  Functions allows you to create your own complex formulas and requests for data from advertising sites directly in the cells of Excel tables or Google Docs. This is the most flexible solution for any type of business, but it requires exceptional professional skills. <br><br></li><li>  Supermetrics Uploader - Data Loader in Google Analytics.  It loads data from advertising campaigns on Facebook, Bing Ads, but also works with files in csv format, which removes the restriction on the list of available sites. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e9/f67/cf3/4e9f67cf395743e7b93131811871104e.jpg"><br><br>  The Supermetrics service is paid, but we cannot call a free analogue, which at least stood close in data processing power and functionality.  Another warning: the service is in English, so working with it requires additional language skills. <br><br>  The <a href="https://www.bi.owox.com/"><b>BI.OWOX.COM</b></a> system <a href="https://www.bi.owox.com/"><b>is</b></a> more friendly to Russian-speaking users and to popular sites in Russia, including Direct, Facebook, Vkontakte, Yandex.Market and even SEO data, if you use manual download operations.  OWOX helps to upload data to Google Analytics for later analysis of the costs of advertising campaigns.  Once downloaded, all data is processed in the Google Analytics interface.  A feature of the system is the need for each import to create a new data set in Google Analytics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c72/1f9/05e/c721f905e56f45f6ad2796e9c098ab79.jpg"><br><br>  We use all the listed tools in RealWeb - the effectiveness of each method depends on the task set for managers.  The main thing is to conduct a thorough analysis of the data, leading them to uniformity.  Web analytics can work wonders: increase website conversion, set profitability points, and open up new opportunities for working with clients.  If you miss these opportunities, you miss the extra income.  Believe, your online advertising can work more efficiently. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293202/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293202/</a></p>
