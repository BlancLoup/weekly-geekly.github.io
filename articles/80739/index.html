Without ideas, wishes, recommendations and advice from users and the hard work of the development team that brought it all to life, it would never have turned out what it is now.  Today, WordPress presents us with a powerful full-fledged CMS, suitable for almost any need.  In this article, we will show you how WordPress has evolved into the current version, we will follow the changes in the control panel in each version. <br><br>  Since May 27, 2003, when WordPress was launched, and until today, 57 releases have been released.  In this article we will try to display only the most important and significant changes concerning the user interface.  You can watch the releases on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Versions">official WordPress site</a> , where you can even download some of them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  WordPress 0.71 - Gold (May 2003) </h3><br><img title="wordpress071" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress071-550x342.gif" width="550" height="342"><br><br>  The page opened by default was at the same time a page for writing a new post.  As you can see, the control panel as such simply did not exist.  Functions were very limited and everything was very simple.  All you have been allowed to do is to add categories to posts.  The tedious installation process required a lot of things to enter manually.

    <h3>  WordPress 1.0.1 - Miles (January 2004) </h3><br><img title="wordpress101" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress101-550x350.gif" width="550" height="350"><br><br>  Starting with this version, important WordPress releases are beginning to be named after famous jazz musicians.  For example, this one was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis">Miles Davis</a> .  In this version, WordPress stops using its b2 prototype file structure and starts developing its own.  Already, it is possible to add several categories to the post.  Also, it is already possible to select the CNC using mod_rewrite.  The installer is much simpler than the previous version.  The links ‚Äúedit this page / comment‚Äù were first introduced.  Also added the ability to moderate comments. <br><br><h3>  WordPress 1.2 - Mingus (May 2004) </h3><br><img title="wordpress12" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress12-550x350.gif" width="550" height="350"><br><br>  The release was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mingus">Charles Mingus</a> .  One of the most important updates in this version was Plugins.  For the first time, the architecture of WordPress plug-ins was presented in this release, and to this day it is unchanged.  Also among the important improvements of the version were: subcategories, custom fields, creating thumbnails, record previews, encrypted passwords and the ability to ping more than one service at a time. <br><br><h3>  WordPress 1.5 - Strayhorn (February 2005) </h3><br><img title="wordpress15" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress15-550x350.gif" width="550" height="350"><br><br>  This version of WordPress was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Strayhorn">Billy Strayhorn</a> .  This is where the first hint to "Control Panel (Console)" appeared.  Now WordPress consists not only of posts, but it can also have pages.  In addition, added support for topics. <br><br><h3>  WordPress 2.0 - Duke (December 2005) </h3><br><img title="wordpress20" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress20-550x350.gif" width="550" height="350"><br><br>  Named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Ellington">Duke Ellington</a> , this version was the first to notice significant changes in the user interface.  A big blue heading appeared in the admin area, which would later be refused.  This is the first version in which the full WYSIWIG editor was used.  Also in this release was presented plugin Akismet Spam Protection.  The remaining innovations: the loader of images and files, preview templates using thumbnail.png, improved administration with AJAX, improved publishing speed and many new features for developers. <br><br><h3>  WordPress 2.1 - Ella (January 2007) </h3><br><img title="wordpress21dash" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress21dash-550x345.gif" width="550" height="345"><br><br><img title="wordpress21" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress21-550x350.gif" width="550" height="350"><br><br>  This time the release is named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Fitzgerald">Ella Fitzgerald</a> .  In this version of WordPress got a lot of new features.  The most noteworthy are the control panel interface for quick work, spell checker and its own comments menu. <br><br><h3>  WordPress 2.3 - Dexter (September 2007) </h3><br><img title="wordpress23" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress23-550x350.gif" width="550" height="350"><br><br>  WordPress 2.3 was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_Gordon">Dexter Gordon</a> .  In this release, the focus was on improving security and stability.  Also, there were several changes in the Control Panel.  Users can now add tags to WordPress.  A notification about updates was added when the version of any of the plug-ins or the platform itself became obsolete.  WordPress also learned to redirect users to the desired URL at the request of the user, such as on a site with www or without www. <br><br><h3>  WordPress 2.5 - Brecker (March 2008) </h3><br><img title="wordpress25dash" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress25dash-550x350.gif" width="550" height="350"><br><br><img title="wordpress25" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress25-550x350.gif" width="550" height="350"><br><br>  Skipping over version 2.4 and justifying it by the fact that 2.5 includes twice the planned changes, the developers named the new release in honor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brecker">Michael Brecker</a> .  We see a completely new control panel interface.  The console has acquired a lot of useful information and has become much more convenient.  This was the first version where plugins found on WordPress.org became possible to update in one click.  Fully enhanced visual editor and built-in gallery were also included in this release. <br><br><h3>  WordPress 2.6 - Tyner (July 2008) </h3><br><img title="wordpress261" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress261-550x350.gif" width="550" height="350"><br><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCoy_Tyner">McCoy Tyner</a> is a jazz musician in whose honor this version was named.  The developers added word count to the post editing page, and added Turbo, which allowed using Google Gears. <br><br><h3>  WordPress 2.7 - Coltrane (December 2008) </h3><br><img title="wordpress27dash" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress27dash-550x350.gif" width="550" height="350"><br><br><img title="wordpress27" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress27-550x350.gif" width="550" height="350"><br><br>  This version was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane">John Coltrane</a> .  We see another big reworking of the console interface, which was warmly received by most of the community.  The control panel became more productive and began to include several settings.  In addition, we were able to install plugins directly from the admin.  Also, the control panel has acquired such innovations as: response to comments from the console, tree comments, attached posts, hotkeys, pagination of comments, and much more. <br><br><h3>  WordPress 2.8 - Baker (June 2009) </h3><br><img title="wordpress28" src="http://wp-config.ru/wp-content/uploads/wordpress28-550x338.png" width="550" height="338"><br><br>  This version is named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Baker">Chet Baker</a> .  The control panel has acquired several convenient settings and now allows you to hold 3 columns.  Upon closer examination, you can see that nothing has changed much in the interface, but everything has definitely become much faster. <br><br><h3>  WordPress 2.9 - Carmen (December 2009) </h3><br>  The version is named after <a title="Carmen McRae" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_McRae">Carmen McRae</a> .  The reason there is no screenshot here is that we just want you to update right now if you haven‚Äôt done it before.  Immediately after the release of WordPress 2.9, I <a title="published material" href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/wordpress/78763/">published the material</a> on Habr√© with an overview of the main advantages of this version.  You definitely need to update your version. <br><br><h3>  A few words in conclusion </h3><br>  Looking back, you can see that WordPress has come a long way before becoming what it is now.  There have been many successful changes within the engine and much remains to be improved.  But the WordPress development team would not have been able to implement even half of what was done without the enormous help of the community.  You can also join the <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/beta/">Beta Release List</a> and beta test new versions of this great CMS, and help WordPress grow and improve by sending bug tracks and offering ideas for improvement. <br><br>  <em>The material is based on</em> <em><a title="Permanent link: A Journey Through The Years Of The WordPress Interface." rel="bookmark" href="http://planetozh.com/blog/2008/12/a-journey-through-five-years-of-wordpress-interface/">A Journey Through The Years Of The WordPress Interface</a> and <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/evolution-of-wordpress-user-interface-2003-2009/">Evolution Of The WordPress User Interface (2003 - 2009)</a> , equipped with its own observations.</em>  <em>Could not decide which blog to add ‚ÄúUser Interfaces‚Äù or ‚ÄúWordPress‚Äù, the latter outweighed relevance.</em> <br>  <i>Original article on <a href="http://wp-config.ru/featured/evolyuciya-polzovatelskogo-interfejsa-wordpress-2003-%25E2%2580%2593-2009/">wp-config.ru</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80739/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80739/</a></p>
