  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How two weeks ?!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How do you need two weeks for this task?  Really?  Here on this elementary with three fields and two buttons?  Two weeks?  Yes you are kidding me, probably!  Let's figure it out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ea/9a5/2ed/2ea9a52edb82bbf3069a65cfc2d2a211.jpg" align="right">  What?  Do I need data validation during input?  Well, of course, needed!  And in general, this field is better divided into two, so it is more understandable.  But add to this mask.  And this is to replace the drop-down list.  Where to get options for this list?  In the database on the server, of course.  How are they not there?  And, yes, yes, this was another project we had ... Well, it means that we must add.  Get in there and add here.  Now I will give you the contact of the developer of that project - discuss it with him.  True, he no longer works with us, but I think it is quite possible to ask what and how - he will tell, most likely. <br><br>  Have we discussed everything?  Not?  What else? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Do I need a picture on the background?  Of course, it is necessary.  Without the picture is gray and sad.  Yes, our designer will do.  On holiday?  Well, you still do some kind of stub yourself, and on Monday he will come out and do it.  No, not this one that will be Monday, next.

      Now everything is already?  Not again?  What else is there?  Yeah, there are two behaviors - such and such.  Damn, both seem logical!  So, you need to make a setting so that the user can choose one way or another.  No, well, not on this form!  Here, draw such a gear - and use the new screen to open it, and there is already a choice of these options.  And, since we have a form of settings, let's immediately add to it this one and this one.  Well, we realize that it works according to these settings.  I've been wanting for a long time, just somehow it was not up to it, but if you do it anyway, then why pull it.  Everything is of the same type, you can do it quickly. <br><br>  Well, of course with unit tests.  And with integration, yes.  And localization too, undoubtedly.  Yes, it should work with both vertical and horizontal orientation.  And with the previous version should also be compatible.  Yes, asynchronously.  And with logs.  And the documentation also need to be corrected.  Well, what kind of questions at all?  Not the first day you work. <br><br>  So, did you figure it out?  Finally!  And now, when everything is already clear, let's once again soberly assess the situation and again estimate how much time is needed for implementation? <br><br>  How two weeks ?! <br><br><h4>  Morality </h4>  It makes no sense to convince the programmer that the task assessed by him can be done faster.  He may err on the side of lowering the deadlines, but on the side of overestimation - almost never.  If you can help with extra hands, lower requirements, decent overtime payoff - do it.  Just to persuade him that there is nothing complicated and this can be done quickly - it means to deceive him, yourself and the customer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170777/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170777/</a></p>
