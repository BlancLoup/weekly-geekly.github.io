That is why modern cloud communications are becoming especially relevant. <br><br>  We at IPtelefon have been dealing with communication technologies for many years, offering our customers various solutions - from boxed PBXs to cloud services.  And today we are seeing a really big interest in the ‚ÄúOffice in your pocket‚Äù concept, which we developed back in 2015. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fc/6f6/c7c/3fc6f6c7c24f4bb2ac00ca9211b4ac8b.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The fact is that modern entrepreneurs seek to use all the resources to the maximum, so many of them do not rent offices at all, they work ‚Äúon the go‚Äù.  At the same time, the entire staff of specialists uses their mobile phones for all business contacts, and without due optimization such a communication system creates a certain chaos - after all, the client does not receive a single point of contact with the company. <br>  Trying to respond to customer requests, we have developed a finished product based on our cloud-based PBX Hive, which is focused on working with cell phones.  Generally speaking, almost any modern cloud PBX can connect mobile subscribers (albeit with varying degrees of control and comfort), but most of the offers on the market consider this process as an addition to landline and soft phones.  But on the basis of Hive, we have released a product that can only work with mobile phones, of course, if you do not need the rest of the communication channels. <br><br>  <b>IP-SIM at the service of business</b> <br><br>  One of the features of the "Office in your pocket" is the use of "unusual" SIM-cards.  The so-called IP-SIM is very different not only from traditional SIM-cards that you buy from a mobile operator, but also from FMC-cards, which are offered along with a number of cloud PBXs.  Let's look at this issue in more detail. <br><br>  A regular sim card uses the cellular operator's network to make all calls, without exception - incoming and outgoing.  If you receive the FMC service, then there is an opportunity to call your colleagues on short numbers and at special rates, but all calls to the urban telephone network, including other operators and long-distance services, remain the responsibility of the service provider.  IP-SIM is different in that it does not use the operator‚Äôs network directly - all calls from such a SIM card pass through the cloud PBX, which means you can monitor them, record, route through more profitable communication channels and, importantly, integrate with CRM- system for full-fledged customer service by different managers. <br><br>  When using a cloud PBX in conjunction with IP-SIM, a business gets the opportunity to set up quite complex call routing schemes, while maintaining a single customer referral number to the company.  Moreover, when making an outgoing call, the client also sees the company number, which can be in the format of an urban 8 (495) or federal 8 (800) number.  All this gives solidity to the ‚Äúmobile business‚Äù with minimal communication costs. <br><br>  <b>Functions</b> <br><br>  Let's take a closer look at what a business gets when a single mobile PBX is connected to a fully managed sim card? <br>  First, we can talk about cost optimization.  Calls practically do not "settle" in the operator's network - it provides only communication channels from IP-SIM to your cloud PBX.  This makes it possible to use IP-telephony in all directions - from intracity to intercity and international. <br>  Secondly, a single number appears, which becomes a single point of contact between the client and the company.  At the same time, several lines can be allocated to a virtual PBX, so that customers can make calls and talk to company employees at the same time dialing the same beautiful number.  At the same time, all conversations are recorded and monitored. <br>  Thirdly, additional functionality appears in the form of IVR (voice menu), which makes it possible to set greetings for off hours and in case all employees are busy.  The company can also set up call forwarding and change the call processing rules at any time.  Even while on vacation in another country, the boss can set up call forwarding to a local mobile phone, purchased, for example, in Thailand. <br>  But finally, fourth, integration with CRM makes it possible, without having an office or a server, to collect all the information about interaction with customers and use it in the future - for quality service and additional calling.  So, the window company will know which windows and in what quantity are installed at the customer by his phone number alone. <br><br>  <b>Interface</b> <br><br>  It is worth saying a few words about how all this looks in reality.  A user-friendly cloud PBX is a convenient portal with several sections.  The first of them is responsible for monitoring, it shows the statistics of what is happening in the company's telephone network: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af4/f51/14d/af4f5114d0d24384808530ea442aed50.png" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the most important moments - work with virtual numbers.  When you select a virtual number and enter the settings for working with it, it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/947/04e/246/94704e2461824100b7662df4f0122450.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And this is how the setting of voice menus and rules for receiving calls at different times of day and on different days looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16c/954/731/16c9547315f2442d91ad903a6a19fe6b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Finally, one of the powerful tools that distinguish virtual PBXs in general and the Office in Your Pocket in particular is the recording of conversations.  By clicking on any file, you can listen to what the staff spoke with customers and it is easy to figure out who is to blame for each situation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7c/d46/b42/b7cd46b4236f49a8b926fac2469ab168.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Connect or not connect?</b> <br><br>  Of course, an individual entrepreneur can work from his personal mobile phone.  By the way, usually it happens.  However, when a business starts to grow, you have employees or friends connect to work, using a centralized beautiful number and complete order with calls to the company, help you gain credibility with customers and follow business processes, ultimately implement CRM and show really professional attitude to customers.  Fortunately, the "Office in your pocket" makes it possible to do all this by simply ordering a couple of services on the site.  You can right now pick up the necessary services on the basis of the cloud-based <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">PBX Hive</a> , as well as choose a <a href="https://www.iptelefon.su/vibor-nomera-495-499">beautiful number for</a> yourself, as they say, ‚Äúwithout departing from the cash register‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300174/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300174/</a></p>
