  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tips on the forums: listen carefully and do the opposite</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Anyone starting to work in a new area for themselves can go to the appropriate topic forum for advice or recommendations.  For most of those who develop their projects on the Internet, this is natural and familiar.  I will try with examples to consider why this practice can do more harm than good. <br><br>  Let's start with the classification of forum characters.  So, what kind of people are on the forums? <br><br>  1. Downs. <br>  Modern society cultivates downs.  This phenomenon must simply be taken for granted.  Starting from the media and ending with renowned usability experts, <a name="habracut"></a>  the whole society is moving to simplify brain activity.  Down, even being an expert in his narrow field, can advise you on anything, from a harmless joke to surprisingly logical nonsense.

      2. Puzomery. <br>  These are people who are simply gaining a rating of posts, and write in response to any topic.  As the Internet grew mainly through the efforts of computer scientists, these same computer people are used to treating everything as mathematical problems.  Have a number of posts?  Let's get a rating out of him - cool!  Well, and then the Internet spilled out into the world, and completely different people came and just took it for granted.  In fact, of course, this number is in no way connected with the professionalism of the person who answered you. <br><br>  3. Advertisers. <br>  These are people who in the neighboring topics sell their services, explicitly or implicitly.  The essence of your question does not matter: the advertiser will see your post on his own, or the post will be discovered by a search bot.  In any case, the advertiser will answer you something like: ‚Äúyou leave this business, do your best ... now it is the most profitable‚Äù.  Of course, this answer is given for the sake of covert advertising of its services in the mentioned area.  Sometimes it is used to advertise third-party resources: write about Russians - advertise an anti-Nazi website in the comments, write about games, advertise a game portal.  And so on. <br><br>  4. OBS agents. <br>  OBS - stands for "One Grandma Said."  This means that the person who responded sends you a rumor - somewhere a heard bike, a dozen times distorted and presented in a completely wrong light.  But a person at the same time increases self-esteem, passing such "important" information and positioning himself as a source of adequate information.  Such people are usually quickly blown away by a direct request to clearly argue their position. <br><br>  5. Grandfathers. <br>  Hazing developed in any society, united by professional grounds.  Its essence lies in the fact that a person who has worked in a certain field for a long time considers himself smarter, better, more successful than a novice in this field.  In fact, the point is that a person has been working in this area for years, and you are at best a couple of months, and therefore you have not had time to gain experience, to acquire connections, or to get a banal profit.  Of course, this distinction does not make an experienced person ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù and does not give him any exalted qualities in comparison with you.  Nothing, except the time spent in the work, he is no different from you. <br><br>  6. Cowards. <br>  Cowards are afraid of everything.  First of all, they are afraid that the newcomer will come into their business sector and eat ‚Äútheir‚Äù piece of cake.  People simply call it ‚Äúburn the money theme,‚Äù while others come up with smart rationales like ‚Äúif supply exceeds demand, then profits will fall.‚Äù  For example, if you publish any useful instruction or manual on the Internet, cowards will be afraid that ‚Äúevery schoolchild‚Äù will begin to stamp ‚Äúgovnoproekty‚Äù on this manual and the profitable business will be covered.  If you do not feel the absurdity of this nonsense, try publishing the biography of Bill Gates and see how many people after this will repeat Microsoft‚Äôs financial success in the foreseeable future. <br><br>  7. Gopnik. <br>  Gopnik in this classification is an aggressive coward.  He is not only afraid for his business, but also aggressively counteracts newcomers.  In this case, nothing prevents him from being a professional in his business.  As a rule, gopniki do not give advice, but only dare people from the topic under discussion.  Psychologically it is very difficult to resist Gopnik: he is a well-known specialist, they listen to his opinion, he has been on the forum for a long time.  But think about it: a person pays attention to you and gives you a negative answer.  If he would not be interested in this topic, he would not answer at all and did not even read this section of the forum.  Ignore him, ignore all his answers, do not get involved in controversy and do not let your mood spoil. <br>  In most cases, the ‚Äúgopnik‚Äù does not explain his position by distinct arguments, depicting a full-grown and busy person.  Do not forget that this is also part of his "one-sided game".  You were given a dubious or negative answer, you were asked to argue, but did you not get any argumentation?  In most cases, this means that you came across a ‚Äúgopnik‚Äù.  It is unpleasant, but nothing terrible.  Ignore and move on. <br><br>  8. Starpers. <br>  These are people of a conservative mindset who do not accept new people in the team.  Thanks to the old footers, for example, the new models of VAZ cars still look like a big-eared Zaporozhets.  Starpers have a negative attitude to all newbies indiscriminately and measure the steepness of the date of registration on the forum.  Like, who has a date earlier - he is smarter.  It is as meaningless as to count the number of posts or comments.  Ignore any negative from them - in most cases you will not lose anything. <br><br>  9. False well-wishers. <br>  This is the reverse version of the coward.  They verbally support clearly unprofitable areas, believing that in this way they divert the attention of newcomers from their own sphere of activity. <br><br>  10. Nationalists. <br>  Provincials will envy the capital's residents for their high wages, the residents of the capital will envy the provincials for the low level of consumer spending.  Russians make fun of Americans, Americans suspect all Russians of cheating.  Former Soviet republics often can not tolerate each other.  It was, is and will be - completely independent of the actions of the media.  Try to isolate racial or caste hostility from messages, otherwise you will be mired in meaningless disputes. <br><br>  11. Mutts. <br>  These are people who imitate others.  This is a monstrously large reservoir of the entire audience.  Imitation is generally characteristic of all mammals, it is through it that animals are trained.  The mongrels pick up any topic under discussion and yelp at it, trying to stifle the conversation between the main interlocutors.  Always look for arguments in the answer: remember, no one will waste time on unparsed good advice, rather it will be the other way around.  There is no argument - mark for yourself the doubtfulness of the character who responded, and go on to the next one. <br><br>  12. Philosophers. <br>  The most unpleasant category.  First of all, because in all other respects it can be very normal people.  Philosophers are characterized by the fact that they give advice in the style of "until you try it yourself, you will not understand."  There are an infinite number of variations, for example: ‚Äúyou understand this only with experience,‚Äù ‚Äúyou need to tighten the screws in practice, adjust, follow,‚Äù or something like ‚Äúhere you need intuition and luck.‚Äù  Remember: this is outright FALSE. <br>  No one is building a business on intuition.  Nuts tightened up only masters in the Soviet jokes.  Any successful entrepreneur has a powerful analytical mechanism.  An entrepreneur who says that he builds a business on intuition and intuition, deceives himself and you.  Any area in which you are fussing is repeatedly calculated by a multitude of people and in a variety of ways, starting from the plates in the Excel and ending with the neural network on measurable indicators.  And everyone had different results.  But to deny the existence of mathematics is a frank lie.  It does not happen. <br><br>  So how to distinguish good advice from bad?  I will try to name a few simple signs.  A good answer should be: <br><br>  1. Essentially.  That is, clearly on the subject matter. <br>  2. Neutral.  Neither obviously negative nor openly benevolent. <br>  3. With arguments. <br><br>  If not, put the answer in the trash.  All the same, everyone goes through life in his own way, and not the fact that even the best advice will help you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52049/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52049/</a></p>
