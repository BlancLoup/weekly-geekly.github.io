      By the way, a little about the history of satellite launches to Mars: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <i>Patriotic astronaut never been lucky with Mars.</i>  <i>Of the 18 Martian stations that were launched before 08/11/2011, four died at the launch site, another four remained in near-earth orbit due to accidents of the upper stages, the connection with the three was lost even before arriving at the "destination" was able to go into orbit around Mars, as she was ‚Äúprescribed,‚Äù the rest didn‚Äôt fully complete the flight program.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Here is a chronicle of our attempts to send stations to Mars:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>10.10.1960 - 1M No. 1 - the accident of the Molniya LV on the 3rd stage of work;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>10/14/1960 - 1M No. 2 - the accident of the Molniya LV on the 3rd stage of work;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>10.24.1962 - Sputnik-22 (2MB-4 No. 3) - crash of the upper stage, the station could not be transferred to the interplanetary trajectory;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>11/01/1962 - Mars-1 (2-4 ‚Ññ 4) - remained operational until 03/21/1963, after which the connection with it was lost.</i>  <i>06/19/1963 passed at a distance of 165 thousand kilometers from the surface of Mars;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>11/04/1962 - Sputnik-24 (2MB-3 No. 1) - crash of the upper stage, the station could not be transferred to the interplanetary trajectory;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>11/30/1964 - Zond-2 (3MB-4A No. 2) - the connection was lost in April 1965.</i>  <i>08/06/1965 passed at a distance of 1500 kilometers from the surface of Mars;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>03/27/1969 - M-69 No. 521 - accident of the Proton-K launch vehicle at the 3rd stage of operation;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>04/02/1969 - M-69 No. 522 - accident of the Proton-K launch vehicle at the 1st stage of operation;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>05/10/1971 - Cosmos-419 (M-71 No. 170) - crash of the upper stage, the station could not be transferred to the interplanetary trajectory;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>05/19/1971 - Mars-2 (M-71 No. 171) - 11/27/1971 the station went into orbit around Mars.</i>  <i>The descent vehicle made a hard landing on the planet's surface on the same day (a soft landing was assumed, but the spacecraft could not be slowed down);</i> <i><br></i>  <i>05/28/1971 - Mars-3 (M-71 No. 172) - 12/02/1971 the station went into orbit around Mars.</i>  <i>The descent vehicle on the same day made a soft landing on the surface of the planet.</i>  <i>Work on the surface of Mars lasted 20 seconds, after which the connection with the device suddenly ceased);</i> <i><br></i>  <i>07/21/1973 - Mars-4 (M-73 No. 52C) - 02/10/1974 failed to bring the station into orbit around Mars;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>07/25/1973 - Mars-5 (M-73 No. 53) - February 12, 1974 the station went into orbit around Mars;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>08/05/1973 - Mars-6 (M-73 No. 50P) - 03/12/1974 the station flew near Mars.</i>  <i>Separated from the flight step, the descent vehicle made a soft landing on the surface of the planet.</i>  <i>However, the connection with him was lost;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>08/09/1973 - Mars-7 (M-73 No. 51P) - 09/03/1974 the station flew near Mars.</i>  <i>Separated from the flight step, the descent vehicle ‚Äúmissed‚Äù and flew into the depths of space;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>07/07/1988 - Phobos-1 (1F No. 101) - 09/01/1988 communication with the station was lost;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>07/12/1988 - Phobos-2 (1F No. 102) - On January 29, 1989, the station went into orbit around Mars.</i>  <i>03/27/1989 communication with the station was lost.</i>  <i>Landing on Phobos did not take place;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>11/16/1996 - Mars-96 - crash of the accelerating unit, the station could not be transferred to the interplanetary trajectory.</i>  <a href="http://www.membrana.ru/particle/17088">a source</a> <a href="http://www.membrana.ru/particle/17088"><br></a> <br><br>  Reading the comments to the next article about Phobos-Grunt in the spirit of ‚Äúeverything is fine‚Äù, I found a link to the <a href="http://open-letter.ru/letter/26645">open letter of Moroz Nikolai Vasilyevich</a> , judging by a letter a year ago, a former employee of the OKB FSUE ‚ÄúNPO im.  S.A.  Lavochkin, where Phobos-Grunt assembled and most of its units were developed.  This is of the greatest interest, since Morozov describes in this open letter some very interesting nuances of the work of the Design Bureau and makes some predictions, one of which, unfortunately, came true at the launch of Phobos-Grunt. <br><br>  I will not draw conclusions, but I can say that after becoming acquainted with these materials I became even sadder and more offensive for the Russian astronautics. <br><br>  <b>Additional links:</b> <br>  1) <a href="http://galspace.spb.ru/index35.html">A more detailed description</a> of the spacecraft flights to Mars (vehicles of all countries). <br>  2) <a href="http://www.sdelanounas.ru/blogs/8864/">Interview</a> with Maxim Martynov, Deputy General Designer - Head of the OKB FSUE ‚ÄúNPO named after S..  Lavochkin ", chief designer for the project" Phobos-Grunt. "  The interview was taken immediately before the launch of the satellite and the letter referred to above is also mentioned there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132428/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132428/</a></p>
