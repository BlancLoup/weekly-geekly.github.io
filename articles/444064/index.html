  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New ideas for a new future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>For those who want to see what they wanted.</b> <br><br><h4>  purpose </h4><br>  The goal of this project is to create a base of ideas, technologies, inventions, solutions in any areas that can be freely used and improved.  Any good idea can be proposed, improved or self-implemented.  It is like the Internet, only intended for quick search, access and suggestions for their ideas to be cataloged. <br><br><h4>  What for? </h4><br>  This is an attempt to build a future in which we will become better and of which we dreamed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why now? </h4><br>  When I imagined the future, I thought that in it we would have incredible technologies that could give stable development in all areas.  Ideas that make life better. <br>  A society that will understand the value of life and its full potential.  And what, as it seems to me, is always lacking - hopes that we can still become something more than just a few hundred states that have divided the Earth into parts, and who consider their borders as the limit of responsibility and place of stay.

      No matter how trite it sounds, I wanted to see a completely different world filled with novelty and progress.  In which it is interesting to live. <br><br>  Flying through space, flying cars, no need to be in search of food every day, and, probably, something else.  What will make life not a process - but something more. <br><br>  But at the moment it is not. <br><br>  We are the same as before - we are trying to survive, at the same time creating a path for ourselves that repeats the same mistakes.  The limited resources and increasing population only exacerbates this situation.  Never in history have we yet had so developed technologies in related fields, and, in my opinion, we have never used them so senselessly and in vain.  The ability to exchange information has become a means of manipulation.  Possibilities of technologies are used for production only in view of the market, causing environmental problems.  The ability to administratively limit the use of technology - to the directional inhibition of scientific and technological progress, which could help solve many problems and accelerate development. <br><br>  And I understand perfectly well that for several decades now they will not drastically change anything. <br>  If you have time, you need to use it.  Now. <br><br>  I appeal to everyone who wants to live in a new future. <br><br>  We can, using our mind and the ability to create - to build a new future that will be better than what awaits us. <br><br>  You do not need to be a genius for this - it is enough just to have your own beliefs and remember that you can create.  This is the main thing. <br><br>  Everything you need to translate - is already there.  The only thing missing for a new future is good and new ideas, as well as those who can materialize them. <br><br><h4>  Of course, you have a question - why is it needed? </h4><br>  ‚ÄúI already earn and live;  I have an interesting income-generating business;  I work and I like work?  Do we need all these efforts for the sake of the future?  Everything suits me. ‚Äù <br>  I will not persuade you in this, as I count on those who have already answered these questions for themselves otherwise. <br><br>  You see the answer now before you.  This is the text on your screen that was created and made by someone.  Software written by someone that displays this text.  All this was done by people.  Different people, for different reasons.  But surely among them were the dreamers who believed that what he had created would live longer than they themselves and create the future that they had in their dreams.  And their contribution to the future has already paid off.  I am grateful to them. <br><br>  In our power to do more and faster.  And, I hope that those who read this text now in the future that we were able to create will understand me best.  He will be inspired, knowing how it all began. <br><br><h4>  How are we going to do this? </h4><br>  To do this, you need the following skills: everything you know now and what you can learn.  We must use our knowledge in all areas to preserve and improve life, to achieve sustainable development, which will not be hampered by any personal conflicts and prejudices. <br><br>  We will start with small tasks, improving ourselves, expanding our knowledge and skills. <br>  We will not violate the laws of the countries in which we are located. <br><br>  To work on the future do not need to move somewhere. <br><br>  Our tool to change the situation - the mind.  We will not harm anyone or force us to accept our point of view.  If someone wants to, he can voluntarily join our project or stop participating in it. <br><br>  This is a decentralized project.  Like open source, only designed to introduce a more effective approach in all areas.  He has no center - everyone can develop everything locally. <br><br>  To be honest, I'm not completely sure that everything will work out. <br><br>  But all other things being equal, ‚Äútry it or not,‚Äù I chose one that could change something. <br><br><h4>  So what should you do? </h4><br>  If you have good ideas - you fill out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11pMXmv6tAn8FQgq2RfFLVJ56qNEsOH_xPNB7xxEQPF4/edit">form</a> with an idea / link / illustration, drawing.  I add it to the catalog / list of ideas. <br><br>  You want to do / improve something and are looking for options or ideas - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Im3r-HUR1axov2SMmY1KjDunm4-ECDyuVPAfzOo0rfs/edit">go to the directory / list</a> , choose and implement it, improve it.  The only condition is that you should not violate the law if this idea or invention is protected by a patent in your country. <br><br>  Further, the catalog with ideas / forms for adding may change, but for now it will be here: <a href="http://www.ideas.deltay.tech/">www.ideas.deltay.tech</a> <br><br>  Just one request - do not invent bad ideas :) <br><br>  What to do with the ideas that you come up with or want to use if they are already protected by patents?  The answer is simple - improve them.  Create new ones.  I do not believe that there is only one way to solve the problem. <br><br>  In the catalog so far only those ideas that have been able to come up with / improve myself.  Do not be surprised and do not be shy of simple descriptions and solutions - they sometimes allow you to take a different look at the task. <br><br>  On the old roads can not come to a new place.  Need to lay a new one.  This time there is an opportunity to consciously choose the direction and not repeat past mistakes. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  I would like to hear the opinion of specialists who understand distributed (decentralized) databases, how big it can be without losing the effectiveness of search and access to information.  Maybe some of you have already thought through this decision.  Blockchain / mesh for the blockchain / mesh is not needed, you need an opinion / suggestion about the architecture of such a system. <br><br>  Thanks for taking the time to read. <br><br>  References: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ideas.deltay.tech/">New ideas for a new future</a> <br>  <a href="https://vk.com/ideasforfurute">VK group</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444064/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444064/</a></p>
