After approval by Nokia shareholders and regulatory authorities, the acquisition of Microsoft‚Äôs Nokia Devices and Services business unit was completed by Microsoft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6f/480/974/d6f48097463d5800d50e4c5500f9b0c9.png"><br><br>  For our readers, here on Nokia's Habrablog and for our fans around the world, something new is starting today.  But we are happy to tell you that many of the things that are most important to you will not change. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main news that seems to us worried everyone: as part of Microsoft, we will continue to produce, sell and service phones and devices, including devices from the Lumia, Asha lines and Nokia X family models.

      The engineers responsible for the hardware and talented designers who created the device under the Nokia brand will continue to work as part of the Microsoft Devices Group. <br><br>  We will also continue to develop our software.  Unique photo, music and location features that have become a valuable part of our devices will continue to be developed, maintained and improved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a4/7bc/ac4/1a47bcac476b167edefec3b4f26b9b6f.jpg"><br><br>  It is important for existing users to know that we still respect their rights.  Current changes do not touch the warranty on your devices, they will still be looked after by the support and service team.  You can still get help and support through regular channels: online support, contact centers, and local Nokia Care points. <br><br>  We will also continue to take care of your personal data with care - our commitment to your privacy remains paramount. <br><br>  Well, we, the official blog of Nokia on Habrahabr, still remain here, along with the rest of the channels in social networks.  We, as well as the Nokia pages on <a href="http://vk.com/nokia">VKontakte</a> , <a href="">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/NokiaRu">Twitter,</a> will continue to publish news and information about devices and services.  They will be led by the same people and teams. <br><br>  So today, most of the things remain the same. <br><br>  Nevertheless, today is an exciting day for us and historical for the industry.  But none of this would be possible if you were not our readers and our fans all over the world.  We have already experienced a lot together and we hope that you will join us on our new exciting journey! <br><br>  At the end of the post, we want to publish an open letter to the Executive Vice President of the Microsoft Devices Group, <b>Stephen Elop</b> : <br><br>  <i>Today, we are announcing that the acquisition of Microsoft's Nokia Devices and Services business unit has finally been completed, following approval by Nokia shareholders and regulatory authorities.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Six months ago, we announced our plans to merge the best divisions of Microsoft and Nokia.</i>  <i>Today is a great day for us, the members of the Nokia Devices and Services team, because we are joining the Microsoft family and are taking the first, but already such an important step in this long journey.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>For our part, we are very concerned about the idea that we can create technology that will change the world.</i>  <i>Starting with Microsoft‚Äôs early task of installing a personal computer in every home and on every desktop, and ending with Nokia‚Äôs concept of connecting billions of people to the Internet using mobile devices, we have provided new opportunities for several generations.</i>  <i>But we could not have achieved all of this if we had not been admirers all over the world.</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fb/fcd/628/0fbfcd6284a482a06b952ed67eaf8a6b.jpg"><br><br></i>  <i>Your support has given a serious impetus to the development of Nokia Lumia smartphones, and their popularity around the world is only increasing.</i>  <i>Only last year, all the awards, positive reviews and tremendous reviews of our fans were excellent proof that our phones and tablets set popularity records.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And we will definitely support the development of our functional devices segment represented by the Asha and Nokia X families, the last of which the world learned at the World Mobile Congress in February.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Do you want to read more, take more photos, watch more, listen more or work more - Nokia mobile devices have always been and remain your starting point.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>As a result of combining Microsoft and Nokia Devices and Services and turning them into one large family, we will combine our efforts, dedication and commitment to provide you with the best that our joint technologies can offer at the moment.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Together, we can connect people and enable users to experience in their work everything that is part of the most important mobile and cloud technologies in this world.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Starting from this day, our possibilities are endless.</i>  <i>Because now we are one!</i> <i><br></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220887/</a></p>
