  <section class="page js-page"><h1>P2P technology bankrupts disc pirates</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you believe MPAA, RIAA and IFPI, then file-sharing networks are a breeding ground for piracy, which causes the world economy a loss of billions of dollars a year and increases unemployment.  But where are these crowds of unemployed and ruined musicians?  They are not.  But there are other people whom P2P technology really brought to bankruptcy.  Here is the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/p2p-file-sharing-ruins-physical-piracy-business/">story of a</a> professional British pirate with fifteen years of experience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Tony began his pirate career in the 90s.  In flea markets and pubs, he sold counterfeit software and games at bargain prices, as well as pirated cartridges for gaming consoles.  “The profit was awesome,” <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/p2p-file-sharing-ruins-physical-piracy-business/">says Tony</a> .  - We took 25 pounds for a couple of games for PSX and 15 pounds for a CD with a set of utilities.  We did not have time to write them down. ”  Every week came out a thousand pounds of net profit. <br><br>  The first two hours of sales on Saturdays and Sundays were the most profitable: “We laid out 60 discs in the back of the van and immediately gathered around the crowd.  We had no competition ... Thirty minutes later, 90% of the goods were already sold, and some buyers took two or three compacts, probably for resale.  Three hours later, we sold out completely and went home with a huge wad of money. ” <br><br>  Until 2001, Tony rented a room where he had three employees engaged in replicating disks 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Then the margins sharply declined, revenues began to decline rapidly and in 2005 the business had to be covered up, and employees were dismissed.  Pirated products are no longer sold in the previous volumes.  Tony continued the business on his own on a smaller scale — his wife and her sister helped burn out the blanks on their home PC.  Soon even this ceased to be profitable: both he and his wife had to move to a smaller house, sell things and get a regular job.

      Tony used to take everything from life: he earned a beautiful house, expensive cars, holidays in exotic countries, prestigious restaurants and the most exquisite wine.  However, he now works in a box factory and wears casual clothes. <br><br>  At the same time, Tony perfectly understands who is to blame for his troubles: “File sharing, P2P - call it what you want.  When I asked the buyer why he didn’t buy anything else, he answered nine times out of ten that he was using BitTorrent or LimeWire.  In addition, almost everyone now has broadband access and the ability to burn CDs. ”  Good old times for Tony will never return. <br><br>  via <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/p2p-file-sharing-ruins-physical-piracy-business/">TorrentFreak</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5516/</a></p>
