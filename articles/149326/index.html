      We conducted the first few free seminars on ITIL in the form of a simulation game "Formula 1".  Ads for habrovchan were <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/147496/%3F">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/148804/%3F">here</a> .  The format in the form of the game was innovative.  So, even from the workshop descriptions themselves it was not clear: ‚Äúwell, ITIL seems to be interesting to many, but it‚Äôs impossible to understand everything in detail ...‚Äù, but Formula 1 does not suffer from a lack of popularity, but here‚Äôs how to cross them among themselves - one could only feel by experience.  In fact, the game was so thoughtful that it completely captivated everyone. <br><br>  Such a simulation perfectly cleans the brain and shows that there is something in the complex processes occurring in the provision of IT-services.  About how you can achieve an understanding of ITIL on the game on the "Formula 1", under habrakatom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa5/fec/dbd/fa5fecdbd0b462737ee0c9076c3a6fd9.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Training participants are a team of technical support for cars in the Formula 1 Championship.  The speed of movement of the cars depends on the proper functioning of all services, which in turn are tied to IT-services.  The occurrence of incidents on any of the servers, applications or network equipment immediately reduces the speed of the car, which in the future could lead to a loss in the race. <br>  In total in the championship there were 3 races for 25 minutes.  Between the races, 30-minute sessions took place to change the infrastructure and introduce new services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/468/5cc/141/4685cc141e4ec4e6ac10ccf460e880dc.jpg"><br><br>  Conclusions of one of the participants of the training: <br><br><ul><li>  The fuller the CMDB, the faster and more accurately you can find the cause of the incident.  (Configuration Management) </li><li>  Proper distribution of roles is very important.  And sometimes the transfer of additional powers to the Helpdesk leads to a strong decrease in the average time to solve an incident. </li><li>  Maintaining a knowledge base helps many incidents to solve the Helpdesk at the stage of opening the incident.  (KnowledgeManagement) </li><li>  A real example: the introduction of a monitoring system for $ 30K helped save $ 3-4M at the last stage.  Only due to the fact that we have guessed about the incident even before its occurrence and met fully armed.  (EventManagement) </li><li>  Analysis of the history of incidents and timely response to trends - again, helps to avoid many incidents.  (ProblemManagement) </li><li>  It makes sense to look carefully at the load charts and think about trends.  Can save in the future.  (CapacityManagement) </li><li>  Proper change planning is important and useful.  But even the slightest mistakes can lead to disastrous consequences.  (ChangeManagement) </li><li>  Motivated employees who understand their role and know about strategy are one of the most important points that helps keep afloat at times when processes are not yet established. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/463/ab5/595/463ab55954d5a492d1e47a14f044fd0f.png"><br><br>  The participants in the game tested in practice the usefulness of the main processes from ITIL v3.  And time flashed unexpectedly quickly.  And in general, it was very interesting to observe how adult uncles and aunts play and behave in one or another role :) It was clear that any real-world IT process could be broken into components corresponding to game processes.  And the results of not / made decisions were immediately noticeable.  If in one group the IT management was slowing down, then it was immediately visible on the result.  In another group, Service Desk made a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù process setup - and this gave not a small result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c8/3ce/01f/1c83ce01f2daaf66e568ca1de521a31f.png"><br><br>  It should be noted that there was no ‚Äúgame for the sake of the game‚Äù, but there was a game where one could be inside and outside the process.  Thanks to the ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù modeling, all the nuances of the actions of each unit were visible. All the participants of the training were involved in the process - there were no bored ones.  And the task was not simple: a team of almost strangers to solve difficult problems in constant time pressure, requiring command interaction. <br><br>  And all participants confirmed that the game is as close as possible to the life and work of IT companies.  That's how it all falls in the head of an engineering support service, the management is forced to act in conditions of a lack of information and decide whether the staff will cope or need to urgently buy the services of other providers - everything is as it should be.  No one was sitting around: everyone was running between the tables, almost knocking down an operator with a camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab6/5a8/175/ab65a8175e51f4cc1a5cd4b1f37c51e0.png"><br><br>  In addition, the following facts also speak about the interestingness of the training: <br><br><ul><li>  There were only 2 who did not attend the 2 free seminars. </li><li>  For 2 days there was only 1 late and then for 10 minutes </li><li>  In the smoking rooms, all participants discussed the connection of IT with business processes, leaving stories </li></ul><br><br>  Here are a few reviews - in a review they didn‚Äôt change a word (we can provide questionnaire scans), many of them are written by habrovchana, so if we change that, they will say. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/menwyy/" class="user_link">Menwyy</a> <a

wonderful, many thanks to the organizers.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The game approach to training turned out to be very correct, very effectively shows the stage of maturity of processes (from inception to

of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing it as a game deserves special positive feedback;</i>  <i>the game helps to quickly grasp the basic aspects and put them into practice.</i>  <i>The ‚Äúdemo‚Äù version of the course

<i><br></i>  <i>By no means.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Following ITIL principles helps, first of all, a company administrator of any size to work calmly, steadily, and planned.</i>  <i>It's simple.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150584/">My topic on the topic</a></i> <i><br><br></i> <br><br>  Here is a small reporting video about what happened. <br><br><iframe width="560"

Yes, the participants themselves ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/menwyy/" class="user_link">Menwyy</a> ) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/148804/%3F">write</a> : <i>To be honest, the recording will not give you much, because the whole essence of the training is in the game</i> <br><br>  In general, this training is not designed for 4 hours (it was an express course), but for 3 days.  Of course, if in just 4 hours the training participants have time to learn a lot and do a lot - in 3 days a solid team creates such a working environment that IT processes go like clockwork. <br><br>  Those from habrovchan who were with us, can write their comments in comments.  And those who have not been can ask questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54c/699/963/54c6999638767225d0d4dbe4b2b1d312.jpg"><br><br><hr><br><br>  Links: <br>  <a href="http://bit.ly/TjAbqq">About ITIL</a> <br>  <a href="http://bit.ly/M64Q9W">About the ‚ÄúRace for the result‚Äù</a> <br>  <a href="http://bit.ly/NQOBPI">3 day training</a> <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149326/</a></p>
