Andy Carvell made a very cool, step-by-step instruction about what you should definitely do.  Delee - rewrite-translation of The Mobile Growth Stack article with my observations and solutions.  The author offers a kind of ‚Äúgrowth card‚Äù.  It is a mandatory activity, which in the complex act as a catalyst for product growth.  The methods specified in it are universal and applicable to any mobile application or game. <br>  This is not to say that all these methods are equally necessary, but at certain stages of the work on the application, each of them matters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e41/263/099/e41263099c3f40769fb878f859e24baf.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some items of infographics, such as ASO, push-notifications, can relate exclusively to the mobile.  Some - to the web or cross-device products or services. <br><br>  Infographics consists of three main levels:

Competent selection of keywords, can give a gain of 300-500 installations per day.  Also it is necessary to designate that ASO is actually window dressing of your application.  The steeper the framed, the richer the client will go. <br><br>  <b>Push-notifications can return up to 5.57% of users / day back into the game.</b> <br><br>  <b>Localization and retargeting</b> relate to all points of the scheme, multiplying their effectiveness at times.  Effective retargeting is to unobtrusively push users stuck at one of the funnel stages to <b>buy inside the application</b> . <br><br>  Unfortunately, there are no solutions for effective mobile retargeting.  Nevertheless, some developments in this direction offer Adroll, TradeMob, Vizuri, Facebook. <br><br>  In general, with sufficiently competent retargeting, you can expand some of the bottlenecks of the funnel by 75-100% and reduce your advertising budget by 30-40%. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúThree whales‚Äù, which is worth analytics applications</b> <br><br>  The solid foundation of your application is its constant analytics, based on ‚Äúthree pillars‚Äù: ‚Äú <i>test-measure-scale</i> ‚Äù.  Any changes that occur to your product, whether it be an update in the app store or an advertising campaign on Facebook, should be monitored using special tools to measure the effect of each action and optimize workflows towards your goals.  The lack of organization in matters of tracking and analytics will lead to unnecessary costs. <br><br>  <b>Retention &amp; engagement</b> <br><br>  Despite the fact that the Retention &amp; Engagement card is in the middle, it is on these elements that attention should be focused first of all.  Assuming that the product itself will become attractive to the user is a big mistake of arrogant people in love with their business.  You can significantly increase engagement through work on UX (user experience), supported by analytic data and user testing.  Competently decorated welcome letters and interesting tutorials will help to effectively ‚Äúprocess‚Äù the newly arrived user. <br><br>  Creating a <b>community</b> around the product will unite and enthuse existing users and attract new ones.  Competent event marketing based on well-thought-out tools of socialization and viralization can double your in-game sales.  Especially effective are sales promo and all sorts of contests / tournaments. <br><br>  The main task of various contests and distributions on Facebook or other social networks is to increase the page's appeal.  If, however, to connect the mechanics of the competition in social networks with the game play, then you can significantly increase the retention of the game itself.  Such contests, for example, in the game The Sword vs the Sword, gave rise to the page involvement by 3-5 times, and retensions grew by 30% - 40% during the period.  Learn more about our work on this game by downloading the case. <br><br>  Reactivating <b>passive users</b> in the era of mobile is not an easy task.  It is easy to remove the application from the device, it is even easier to find a similar one.  Of course, it is much more efficient to concentrate on maintaining and maintaining the activity of its users, but in some cases, re-activation of a passive user can be more economically beneficial than the acquisition of a new one. <br><br>  <b>CRM</b> (Customer Relationship Management) is a separate huge topic with many ready-made solutions on the product market.  Services such as Kahuna, Localytics, AppBoy, Capptain, etc., are aimed at simplifying the process of getting the target user and communicating with him.  The risk of annoying him constantly annoying messages is very high, so try to make each message personalized and useful.  If you allow the user to customize the type and content of notifications, this will increase the likelihood of his retention and involvement and will lower the risk of his leaving. <br><br>  <b>Deep-linking is</b> advertised as ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù to engage the user.  In some cases this is the case, for example, if the structure of your application is based on linking to individual content units (an online store showcase application).  But deep-linking is not a kid. <br><br>  <b>Acquisition is not only buying a user, but also ...</b> <br><br>  The term <i>user acquisition is</i> often understood as a direct purchase of users.  Paid user acquisition becomes an important part of an application promotion strategy and can significantly affect its success.  It can also be a costly lesson about the importance of the attractiveness of the application and turning it into the user's habit. <br><br>  Without exception, all users make the final decision on how to download the application on its page in the app store, so ASO is the main activity both for finding the application by the user and for getting a high conversion. <br><br>  The illusory concept of virality is difficult to recreate by artificial means, since sustained viral growth is rooted in high-quality product and / or viral content.  Despite this, paying enough attention to the distribution of content, gifts, distribution of invitations, you will be able to cultivate the right conditions for the formation of virality. <br><br>  We wrote about many myths of user acquisition on <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/8256/">Megamind</a> earlier. <br><br>  <b>Partnerships</b> with brands and networks are mutually beneficial.  They will help get new users and your partner brand.  A good example is the exchange of characters between Angry Birds and Puzzle &amp; Dragons.  The Japanese from GungHo Online and the Finns from Rovio for 2 weeks made it possible for players to observe each other‚Äôs characters in the game and even go through thematic levels.  Thus, companies are moving among new audiences, attracting new users and not scaring old ones. <br><br>  The additional information background created by social media, <b>PR</b> channels, content marketing, etc., is usually difficult to measure in terms of a direct impact on the growth of the application, therefore, ‚Äúgrowth hackers‚Äù often forget about it.  Nevertheless, such an activity can give a completely measurable brand awareness among the potential audience, which in itself leads to an increase in user acquisition. <br><br>  <b>Do not think about monetizing down ...</b> <br><br>  Even if your company is in the growth stage and you are thinking about creating a user base more than about monetization, at some point you still want to make money.  especially if you have invested your own money in the product.  Such nuances as ways to monetize an application, payment methods, etc., can lead to a fundamental revision of the positioning and the product and its advantages. <br><br>  After users begin to spend money on / in the application, LTV modeling becomes critical and lets you know when and how to scale UA performance. <br><br>  To emphasize the relationship of spots on the map, consider the effect of the introduction of aggressive banner advertising inside your application: <br><br><ul><li>  monetization is likely to increase in the short term, but at the expense of user outflow and reduced virality; </li><li>  the cost of $ 1.99 / app can significantly reduce user acquisition, but lead to even higher returns in return for more moderate growth. </li></ul><br>  Paid applications still exist, but the freemium model quickly becomes a must-have.  Virtual goods are an easily adjustable way to monetize if you manage to pick up something relevant to your audience and if you are not limited to the game.  Line, for example, is monetized using <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/11/19/deloitte-koreas-kakao-fastest-growing-tech-firm-in-asia/">custom stickers</a> .  The use of virtual currency at the same time complicates the control over the economy of the application and facilitates experiments with prices due to dynamic pricing.  Despite the fact that virtual currency is usually considered the prerogative of games, there are vivid examples of its use in applications.  For example, <a href="http://www.skype.com/en/offers/skype-credit/">Skype Credits</a> , which make it possible to call landline and mobile numbers from your Skype account, and are sold in large quantities. <br><br>  Source of inspiration: <a href="https://medium.com/%40andy_carvell/the-mobile-growth-stack-3ffa6856f482">https://medium.com/@andy_carvell/the-mobile-growth-stack-3ffa6856f482</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286784/</a></p>
