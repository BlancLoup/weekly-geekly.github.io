  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scientific and educational school of MSU "LANAT"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today in Russia and the CIS countries there are quite a lot of vacation educational schools for children who have, for the most part, an olympiad direction.  In this article I would like to tell you about a project that is unique for Russia to some extent - the <a href="http://lanat.ru/landing">scientific and educational school of MSU "LANAT"</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d29/64b/bcc/d2964bbccdfdf5512aba2e76707b9021.jpg"><br><br>  Our school has been conducted for several years by a large team of students, graduates and teachers of top Russian universities: Moscow State University, Moscow State Technical University.  Bauman, MIPT.  Our main task is to immerse schoolchildren from all over Russia in the research process, and help them develop skills in project work, public speaking and independence, which are undoubtedly important for any modern specialist (in which, I think, many people in Habrovsk will support me).  The summer school is part of a great year-round work with children - spring and autumn vacation schools, remote work with a supervisor.  Under the cut, I will tell you more about what our guys do and how we organize our learning process. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Educational program </h4><br>  The educational program of the school includes several areas: <br><ul><li>  Physical and mathematical flow (mathematics, physics, programming) </li><li>  Injected flow (electronics, circuitry and everything related to the mechanical and "iron" component of devices) </li><li>  Chemical-biological flow (chemistry and biology) </li><li>  Junior stream (entertaining mathematics and physics, English) </li></ul><br>  Classes in the streams are divided into two types: general ordinary and "special courses".  In general classes, we teach things that are vital for everyone who is on this stream (for example, in computer science classes in the physics and mathematics department, a course on processing arrays of data in Excel and designing and presenting the results of scientific work was taught, and in engineering flow, on basic classes were given basics of soldering and circuit design). <br>  On special courses, the same (special course, by the way, if you wish, you can choose from another stream), the guys were directly involved in their scientific research along with their supervisor.  I will tell you more about the organization of perhaps the most specialized courses for Habr - programming, electronics, engineering and physics.  Examples of the work performed by the guys can be seen below. <br><br><h5>  Programming </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d20/004/45a/d2000445ae7bd2ef4fdd5b94fb0b4f01.jpg">

      In programming, we try to be guided by the principle "the best way to start programming is to program."  Therefore, almost from the very beginning of the special course, the student receives a task (you can choose an idea from a ready-made list or suggest your own), on which he works until the end of school (and some far after).  Tasks are selected very different - from very simple for beginners from scratch (such as the implementation of the game in a sea battle or tic-tac-toe) to complex projects related to data processing and the development of complex web systems.  There is no common language in which the guys work; we try to choose with them the languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies that best suit their task.  Next, the student discusses the idea with the supervisor and receives from him a certain ‚Äústarter kit‚Äù - a list of references, articles, or other projects with which it is necessary to become familiar, and begins independent work on the project.  The head ‚Äúdirects‚Äù the student and advises him on emerging issues.  We try to pay much attention to the issues of algorithmization, the code style and the choice of the correct architectural solutions in the code. <br><br><h5>  Electronics </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c6/78e/d25/6c678ed254d4f639471b24f7f529884e.jpg"><br><br>  On electronics, we are committed to learning how to solder from scratch and read simple circuits, and also, from this year: to control various kinds of electric motors and motors.  This is done in order to: <br><ul><li>  To teach a person who never held a soldering iron in his hands to solder; </li><li>  Teach a person who has already soldered, solder better and better; </li><li>  Teach elements of the calculation schemes.  This is done due to the fact that many who are able to collect quite good boards, are completely unable to invent and reuse old schemes; </li><li>  In the detailed mode, the topic of controlling motors and electric motors is explained. </li></ul><br>  At the end of the course, students deepen in the study of a specific technical problem, trying to make something new in its solution.  Tasks are very different: from simple indicators of falling into the water, to complex devices that read all sorts of data.  The leader in this activity acts as a teacher, in the first part of the course, which can be approached with any question and understand any of the topics studied, and a consultant in the implementation of the project in the second part of the course. <br><br><h5>  Engineering </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cd/7e0/03f/6cd7e003faf4d8721d69ff1cadffccb4.jpg"><br>  On the engineering course, we try to teach children the basics of the development of printed circuit boards, designing, programming microcontrollers.  In the process of learning, we try to move away from ready-made solutions and designers, such as Arduino, Lego Mindstorms and others.  The development of their device, children are from scratch.  They go all the way to create their device or a robot, from creating a mechanical basis to manufacturing a printed circuit board and programming a microcontroller (in our course, we mainly use ATmega32 microcontrollers).  Initially, a list of projects is offered, after which students can choose a task to their liking, or suggest their own idea.  Work on projects begins after a short course on the basics of programming AVR microcontrollers.  The fact is that schoolchildren have practically no knowledge in this area, and to get started, a certain initial level is necessary.  Work on each project is carried out individually.  The supervisor advises the student, tells how and where to find information, and guides the process of creating the device. <br>  Projects of various levels of complexity are offered, from the simplest ones (work with motors and their management) to serious research and development (processing and data flows, communication with complex peripheral devices, etc.). <br><br><h5>  Physics </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e19/c54/fb3/e19c54fb329b3ec3c1c10a1251d25172.jpg"><br>  On this special course, students from the first days of classes independently carry out projects in physics.  The subject of the project can be selected by the student from the list provided or found independently.  Most often on this special course, the guys are engaged in solving the problems of the All-Russian Tournament of Young Physicists.  Among the topics suggested there are fairly simple tasks, for example, the study of the motion of a strong magnet inside a non-ferromagnetic metal pipe, and the principles of operation of engines for model airplanes made of a twisted rubber band.  The solution of these problems has long been known; participants in the summer school are invited to independently investigate this phenomenon, conduct experiments, process their results and present the result of their work in the form of a stand at the school‚Äôs closure. <br>  Quite non-trivial and little-studied phenomena are also offered for research, for example, changing the shape of droplets cone-shaped freezing at a low temperature, and tasks whose solution is not unique, for example, creating a device that converts the heat of a burning candle into electrical energy. <br>  Despite the fact that children work closely with the leader, they do most of the work themselves.  Much attention is paid to research planning and presentation of the results of work (preparation of stands, poster protection, oral presentation). <br><br><h4>  Projects and studies carried out by our students </h4><br><br>  Many of the guys who work with us achieve serious success - victories and prizes in conferences and contests of scientific works of schoolchildren, the presentation of projects at our stand as part of the All-Russian Science Festival.  Some guys were able to get the opportunity to participate in the world's largest review of the scientific work of students of Intel ISEF, held every year in the United States.  Here are some of these works: <br><br><h5>  Cursor control system with voice for people with disabilities </h5><br>  <b>Fedtov Artem, Evgeny Popov, Volgograd</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfe/0b0/2da/dfe0b02da69f28b72aab69d7ed09adcd.jpg"><br><br>  The work of the guys began with a simple idea - to make an uncomplicated toy, in which you need to collect glasses, controlling the aircraft, while controlling the aircraft by using a voice - the louder you speak into the microphone, the higher the aircraft flies.  This idea has undergone significant changes in the course of its work - a voice control interface has been developed that is as stable and simple as possible for users.  Various actions are set up for different sounds during tuning, which are then activated by pronouncing this sound.  The guys created several models that implement this interface - a mouse cursor control system, and a wheelchair model controlled by voice sounds. <br><br><h5>  Desktop laser 3D scanner </h5><br>  <b>Velovaty Daniel, Maxim Khivintsev, Novosibirsk</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d9/9f8/afa/2d99f8afa54c6d72e6388b5702b66b4b.jpg"><br><br>  This project is a complex of a working prototype of a desktop 3D scanner and software for interacting with it.  The scanner design consists of a laser range finder and a rotating platform on which the object is placed for scanning.  The development of guys favorably differs from other models of this class due to high accuracy and speed of work.  Their system is able to build models of small objects in 2-10 minutes (depending on the required accuracy, the maximum possible now is 0.3mm) and save them in obj format, suitable for editing in third-party editors. <br><br><h5>  The system of voluntary distributed computing in the browser </h5><br>  <b>Moiseevsky Alexey, Petrozavodsk</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d9/cda/318/5d9cda318fee688914ec9aa66857b6f2.jpg"><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis work is as follows - to use the principle of popular voluntary computing systems like BOINC or Folding @ home, but as a calculation client module, use not a special software, but a library embedded in a JavaScript web site.  Alexey managed to implement such a system using all modern web technologies like WebWorkers and Asm.js, and not demanding on the resources of client computers. <br><br><h5>  Express diagnostics of the state of soil microbial communities when contaminated with oil products </h5><br>  <b>Vostroknutova Valeriya, Tchaikovsky</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a65/513/e97/a65513e9753c2e4d0b93067a7b200e55.jpg"><br>  Everyone knows that large emissions of oil and products of its processing negatively affect the state of the environment: soil, water, atmosphere.  In this work, Valeria explores the soil of different samples, simulating pollution by oil and diesel fuel.  The result of the project is the development of methods to determine the level of soil contamination, as well as the identification of organic substrates, with which you can solve the issue of the source of pollution.  So, Valeria found out that glucose was actively absorbed in all soils with oil content. <br><br><h5>  The study of the singularity of frozen drops </h5><br>  <b>Smirnov Alexey, Moscow</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebf/4b7/e6a/ebf4b7e6a27c118afc024fd1f131a758.jpg"><br>  When liquids freeze, a lot of seemingly strange effects can be observed.  One of them is considered in this paper - the effect of the formation of ice peaks, or singularities, on droplets of various liquids during their freezing.  Small drops were investigated (so that their surface could be considered spherical), as well as large drops.  The drops were frozen on an aluminum plate at temperatures of -15, -24, -78 and -196 degrees Celsius.  Further, the results were compared with a theoretically calculated geometric model of the final form of a frozen droplet created in MATLAB, by means of such a comparison it was found that the theoretical model accurately predicts the shape of small frozen droplets, but differs from the results for droplets exceeding 1 mm.  It should be noted that the results of this study are surprising: it turned out that the described property has only liquids that expand upon freezing. <br><br><h5>  Generating abstract images using genetic algorithms </h5><br>  <b>Nikita Bashaev, Samara</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b5/408/20a/2b540820a614f0acc24ad7efed888e1b.png"><br>  The objective of this project was to create an algorithm for obtaining beautiful abstract images, and improving these images using genetic algorithms.  You can read more <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/205892/">in the article that we previously published on Habr√©.</a> <br><br><h5>  Negative resistance and its mechanical counterpart </h5><br>  <b>Novikov Oleg, Ivanovo</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a28/1e0/211/a281e02112a95f7fe13f61bf9b5ced2d.jpg"><br>  The basic characteristics of electrical components, such as resistance, capacitance and inductance, are mostly positive.  The author of the project had an idea to create elements with negative effective coefficients.  Their creation will allow to accomplish many different physical goals in another way.  The idea is to create an element within which a certain potential will be located, depending on an external signal.  If this potential is connected via a resistor with the element inputs, a current flowing into the element and corresponding to the element with the specified properties will be provided.  The elements have a very large frequency range, thus suitable for operation in the low and high frequency ranges.  Since the elements were created using an operational amplifier, their operation limitations were also described. <br><h4>  Read more </h4><br>  This year we are coming two summer schools, and one spring.
