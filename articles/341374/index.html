A year ago, in 2017, we <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/it-prognoz-2017-obzor-klyuchevyx-texnologij-kotorye-ozhidaet-znachitelnyj-rost/">published</a> forecasts on what technologies will be developed during the year.  Many assumptions were justified, and the past months are really remembered as time under the sign of security and virtualization. <br><br>  Today we have once again compiled a list of technologies that, according to industry experts, will be decisive for the industry next year. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/341374/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dq/pc/up/dqpcupqs5mhx_g4cykvrsting2s.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/teegardin/5537894072/">Ken Teegardin</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a></i></font>

    <h2>  1. Spending on servers, switches and drives grow </h2><br>  Here without surprises.  The revenue of iron producers was expected to grow all year.  So this fact is difficult to call a fresh trend.  However, we offer a closer look at the situation. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp%3FcontainerId%3DprUS43138817">According to the</a> international research company IDC, in the second quarter of 2017, revenue from sales of components of the cloud infrastructure grew by 25.8% year on year and reached $ 12.3 billion.  And the share of revenues from infrastructure for public clouds now accounts for 33.5% of the market, but more on that later. <br><br>  IDC announces the expansion of sales of server, network equipment, storage equipment.  As for 2018, in the run-up to the Interop ITX technology conference <a href="https://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/8-infrastructure-trends-ahead-2018/489496113">, a</a> survey <a href="https://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/8-infrastructure-trends-ahead-2018/489496113">was conducted of</a> managers from the IT world about future investments.  24% of respondents said their organizations are really planning to increase their IT infrastructure spending by more than 10% next year.  Another 21% is going to meet 5-10%. <br><br>  Judging by the results of the survey, enterprises will increase funding for the following reasons: <br><br><ul><li>  Data growth - 21% of respondents said they would invest in storage equipment in the next 12 months; </li><li>  Alarming news about security vulnerabilities - 59% of respondents called network security one of three priorities; </li><li>  Insufficient network bandwidth - 19% of respondents are going to seriously spend money on network equipment; </li><li>  Wireless future - almost half of respondents will invest in wireless technologies. </li></ul><br><h2>  2. The volume of data is growing, and the media is reduced in size. </h2><br>  We have already touched on this topic in the previous paragraph.  But since this is an important point in planning, we will focus on it in more detail.  The growth of data has been actively talked about for several years - in 2015, Cisco <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/global-cloud-index-gci/white-paper-c11-738085.pdf">predicted</a> that the total amount of data stored in data centers in 2017 will be 370 DL.  <a href="https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/2014iview/executive-summary.htm">According to</a> IDC, the amount of data in the world from 2013 to 2020 will increase by 10 times (up to 44 trillion gigabytes).  Not surprisingly, companies are experiencing, where in the end to store all these arrays? <br><br>  The manufacturer of equipment Western Digital (WD) not so long ago <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2017/10/11/mamr-hard-disk-drives-enable-future-data-centers/">made a</a> very important statement about the future of storage: by 2020, 70% of all data will be placed on the HDD, which the company is now actively developing.  In WD decided to go on the path of increasing the capacity of the disks without increasing the size of the carrier.  Relying on microwave magnetic recording technology (MAMR), the company intends to create HDDs up to 40 TB.  WD says that the first engineering samples of super-compact hard drives will be available to corporate customers in 2019. <br><br>  IBM also puts on flash memory.  The corporation in October <a href="http://www.storagereview.com/ibm_advances_its_allflash_flashsystem">made</a> several changes to its solutions and software modules.  They are aimed at reducing costs and accelerating the deployment of private clouds.  The changes affected the IBM FlashSystem 900 system. Now it also ensures that storing more data costs the user less money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jk/9o/g4/jk9og49gvqu_cg1dgzj-_h9_0n4.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2588%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581-1850170/">Pexels</a> <a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/service/terms/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  3. Internet connection speed increases </h2><br>  In 2018, the growth of the IoT industry is also expected.  Intel, which develops the infrastructure of smart cities, <a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/279997/how-the-internet-of-things-is-helping-intel-grow">predicts</a> good financial performance against the background of this trend.  IoT relies on data and communication with them, so cloud computing and new communications standards will attract even more attention next year. <br><br>  Qualcomm and Verizon are solemnly <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2017/08/07/how-gigabit-lte-phones-can-give-you-fastest-data-speeds-available">moving</a> towards a speedy future.  In October, the processor manufacturer successfully <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2017/10/17/qualcomm-achieves-worlds-first-announced-5g-data-connection-5g-modem">completed the</a> first 5G connection using its chipset for mobile platforms.  In the near future, we should expect an increase in the speed of data exchange between devices of the Internet of things.  By the way, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/iot-devices-will-outnumber-the-worlds-population-this-year-for-the-first-time/">according to</a> Gartner, their number will reach 20 billion by 2020. <br><br>  According to Cisco, video will account for 80% of all Internet traffic by 2021, compared with 67% in 2016. The response to this trend will be the development of a new generation of mobile networks capable of processing more data in a shorter time.  And the changes are likely to begin as early as 2018.  As for Russia, a development center for 5G networks <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/30/09/2017/59ce572c9a794720970b4b9e">will be created</a> here in the next 12 months.  The networks themselves will be deployed in the country in fragments, starting from industrial facilities. <br><br>  At the same time, Nokia is <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/nokia-partners-with-aws-on-cloud-migration-5g-and-iot-strategies/">teaming up</a> with Amazon Web Services to collaborate on IoT and 5G.  The partnership arose from the need for closer integration between the network and the IT infrastructure.  This shows the growing role of cloud computing in the context of the Internet of Things. <br><br><h2>  4. The development of artificial intelligence </h2><br>  Somehow we already had to <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/transformaciya-virtualnoj-infrastruktury-ili-kak-oblako-iaas-vliyaet-na-razvitie-novyx-trendov/">argue</a> that the clouds are actively taking to the service of the technology of artificial intelligence and machine learning.  2018 will most likely demonstrate a new level of this trend, because almost all technological giants are working in this direction. <br><br>  Last year, IBM <a href="http://opensourceforu.com/2016/10/ibm-ai-powered-data-analytics-platform/">launched an</a> AI-based cloud platform.  Microsoft and Amazon <a href="http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/450428900/Amazon-Microsoft-crave-more-machine-learning-in-the-cloud">did not stand</a> aside.  Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3812063">believes</a> that creating systems that learn, adapt and prepare to act autonomously will be the main ‚Äúbattlefield‚Äù between technology vendors until 2020. <br><br>  At the same time, artificial intelligence is <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/ai-is-the-future-of-cybersecurity-for-better-and-for-worse">predicted to</a> play a major role in the fight against cyber threats emanating, oddly enough, from the same artificial intelligence.  As they wrote in the Harvard Business Review: "The main hope for protection against attacks organized with the help of AI is AI." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nf/-f/me/nf-fmeee5uimm3ibypkpfs_msc8.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-616020/">Salvatore P</a> <a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/service/terms/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  5. The hyper-converged infrastructure market is developing. </h2><br>  HPE Jesse St. Laurent (Jesse St. Laurent) recently <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3233864/data-center/can-hyperconverged-infrastructure-solve-the-data-problem.html">presented</a> his thoughts on how the industry will cope with growing information.  He concluded that technologies that efficiently use and process data become the key to solving the problem.  Hyper-converged infrastructure is capable of implementing this, the advantages of which we told in one of our <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/281813/">materials</a> . <br><br>  This trend was often highlighted earlier, but 2017 set a good start for future development: the market <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/17/hyperconverged_market_gets_hypercompetitive/">began to fill</a> with new players, and sales of hyperconvergent systems <a href="https://thestack.com/data-centre/2017/06/26/hyperconverged-market-grows-64-over-2016/">grew</a> by 64.7% in the first quarter of the year right away. <br><br><h2>  6. Cloud services growing in popularity </h2><br>  Judging by the survey from the first paragraph, <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/x-as-a-services-kak-ne-pogryaznut-v-abbreviaturax-oblachnyx-uslug/">XaaS</a> are at the very peak and remain an important trend.  Only 10% of respondents did not see values ‚Äã‚Äãfor themselves in cloud services.  The rest choose them as a viable alternative to impressive investments in their own equipment. <br><br>  2018 is very important for technology.  According to IDC forecasts, by the end of it 40% of IT costs for both hardware and software <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/08/01/creating-hybrid-bridge-data-center-cloud">will be concentrated</a> around the clouds. <br><br>  At the Cloud Services Russia conference, IDC representative in Russia and the CIS Dmitry Gavrilov <a href="http://www.plusworld.ru/daily/tehnologii/obem-rynka-oblachnyh-uslug-v-rossii-sostavit-okolo-364-mln-doll-k-kontsu-2017-g/">said</a> that in 2017 the Russian cloud services market will reach $ 364 million. <br><br>  In 2017, we witnessed how many businesses migrated to the cloud.  The trend has <a href="https://increment.com/cloud/why-startups-should-run-on-cloud-providers/">not bypassed</a> startups, which acquire greater flexibility here to <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/oblachnye-servisy-opyt-ispolzovaniya-iaas-rossijskimi-kompaniyami/">carry out</a> "strategic maneuvers."  The experience of our clients demonstrates how IaaS allows you to effectively manage costs, for example, in the <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/elektronnaya-torgovaya-ploshhadka-railcommerce-razmestilas-v-iaas-oblake-it-grad/">case of</a> an electronic freight platform or a City-call <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/kontakt-centr-city-call-ispolzuet-iaas-oblako-it-grad/">contact center</a> . <br><br>  Several trends in the cloud market, which will continue their development next year, <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/trendy-oblachnogo-rynka-ot-tipizacii-reshenij-do-evolyucii-sla/">were noted</a> at the conference ‚ÄúClouds 2017: Main Trends‚Äù - they relate to the expansion of providers' portfolios with new services and model solutions and the evolution of SLA. <br><br>  An important sub-trend that helps the main trend is the expansion of the market of tools for the transition of enterprises to the clouds.  Therefore, we can expect that 2018 will open the way to cloud technologies for a record number of organizations. <br><br><hr><br>  PS About the trends of the corporate IaaS market can be found in our blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/bim-uxodit-v-oblaka-obzor-klyuchevyx-reshenij-dlya-informacionnogo-modelirovaniya/">BIM goes to the cloud: information modeling solutions</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/transformaciya-virtualnoj-infrastruktury-ili-kak-oblako-iaas-vliyaet-na-razvitie-novyx-trendov/">How does the IaaS cloud affect the development of new trends?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/resheniya/oblachnye-texnologii-dlya-resheniya-zadach-v-stroitelnom-biznese/">Cloud technologies for solving problems in the construction business</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341374/</a></p>
