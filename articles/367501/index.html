Windows 10 Mobile - Build 10149</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Yesterday evening another build for insiders was released - Windows 10 Mobile (10149) </h4><br>  A little more than a week passed and Microsoft introduced a new build.  There are no new devices in the list of supported ones, but there are rumors that HTC 8X will get access to Insider Preview soon. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97f/541/7b5/97f5417b5ebc4bfb93c5ca72a340e561.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is new? </h4><br><ul><li>  General UI and UX improvements.  You will see many improvements to the user interface and the overall look of the system.  Fixed a bug that caused live tiles to appear blurry on the home screen, so now the home screen looks beautiful.  You will also see much more beautiful settings for managing the system with updated icons and other visual components (volume controllers, for example).  In general, the operating system is now more responsive to use.  Microsoft is still a lot of work in this regard, but a lot of work has already been done. </li><li>  Microsoft Edge.  The first thing you will notice in this build is the new Microsoft Edge browser, formerly known as Project Spartan.  The address bar moved to the bottom of the screen, as requested by users.  There is also the ability to choose a mobile or desktop version of displaying websites.  Just note that all history files, favorites, cookies and reading list will be deleted. </li><li>  Cortana improvements.  Notebook Cortana is now in the final stages of development.  Quiet time settings moved to Cortana settings. </li><li>  Notification Center.  One of the most popular requests was the ability to activate the flashlight through the notification center and now it is implemented in build 10149. Open the notification center, open all the switches and find the flashlight there .. </li><li>  Updated photo app for Windows 10. Published update for photo app through Windows Store Beta.  This update contains general improvements in performance and stability, as well as support for a new file format - GIF (works on smartphones with 1 GB of RAM and above).  It is also one of the most popular requests.  Links to saved photos, screenshots and camera gallery are now available on the album page. </li><li>  Automatic backup camera in OneDrive.  Automatic backup of photos is now taken over by the OneDrive application, so you need to open the OneDrive application to set up backup. </li></ul><br><h4>  What is fixed? </h4><br><ul><li>  Fixed bug with inactive SMS spam filter and calls after the previous update. </li><li>  Fixed a bug due to which text notifications were not always displayed for incoming messages. </li><li>  Fixed a bug that prevented the podcast application from working. </li><li>  Fixed a bug due to which some applications could not be installed or updated through the Windows Store Beta application store. </li><li>  Fixed a bug that prevented the system from hiding the navigation bar. </li></ul><br><h4>  What bugs added? </h4><br><ul><li>  Some users may detect error 80091007 while trying to upgrade from 10136 to 10149. If you encounter this problem, Microsoft recommends waiting for a new build.  But if you want to get the update now, use the Windows Phone Recovery Tool to roll back to Windows Phone 8.1, and then upgrade your smartphone to 10149. </li><li>  Insider Hub has been removed from this build, but will return in the following. </li><li>  Sometimes the keyboard for entering the PIN code may not appear when you try to unlock the smartphone.  The fix is ‚Äã‚Äãto swipe down to call the notification center and try to open the notification or settings to force the keyboard panel.  There is a small chance to encounter a very rare situation when entering a PIN code will not be able to unlock your device and it will continue to ask the code even after you have entered it correctly.  If you encounter this, leave your phone alone for 1-2 minutes and then try to unlock again. </li><li>  If you have a Gmail account set up, the messaging application may run into problems and incoming / outgoing messages may simply not work.  Faced with this problem?  Just restart your smartphones .. </li><li>  There is a bug, because of which the games you bought can be installed as a demo version.  Internal purchases are still not working out correctly, since the migration process to the new app store is in full swing. </li><li>  In some cases, the colors in the applications may change.  For example, the color of the headers in Outlook Mail may turn orange. </li><li>  It happens that notifications in the center are displayed empty. </li></ul><br><br>  Gabe Aul about the new build: <b>‚ÄúWe used this build inside the company for several days and really loved it.</b>  <b>It is faster, more stable and visually more pleasant.</b>  <b>Personally, I am very happy to see the implementation of many of the ideas you asked for.</b>  <b>It reminds me of why I admire Windows insider and your ability to make personal contributions to Windows 10 development. "</b> <br>  Learn more about updating to the <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/06/25/announcing-windows-10-mobile-insider-preview-build-10149/">Microsoft</a> blog. <br>  <b>PS: According to personal feelings, the build really claims to be the most stable.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Important: in the assembly there is still no data migration screen after the update, so after the update you will watch the lock screen without the date and time for about 10 minutes.</b>  <b>Be patient and just wait for the process to complete.</b>  <b>The clock and date will appear on the screen and you will be able to unlock your phone (Hello to those who are in a hurry to make a reset and do not understand that the update process has not been completed).</b> <b><br></b>  <b>UPD: On some sites people complain that sent SMS is not always delivered and sent to you do not always come, be careful and do not forget that this is a build for review - it is better not to put it on the main phone.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>UPD2: Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview 10149 July 7 became available for a slow update cycle.</b> </div>
