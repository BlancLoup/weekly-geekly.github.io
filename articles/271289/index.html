  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Transfer server farms to more advanced and energy efficient server cooling technologies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, the authoritative publication The Guardian published its predictions: energy consumption for air conditioning will increase 33 times by 2100.  According to calculations, now, for the United States alone, as much energy is used for cooling buildings as the whole of Africa consumes.  China and India are not far from the United States in quantities of electricity consumption.  The results are not quite comforting, it turns out that soon our civilization will use more energy for cooling purposes than for heating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fb/2bd/144/6fb2bd14476b44189d0ddc43ef740249.jpg"><br><br>  Air conditioners cool homes, offices, buildings and more, food and medicine, chemicals and many other materials.  They also cool servers inside server farms around the world.  Without such devices, the data center will not be able to function, and the world wide web will collapse in a matter of minutes.

      It should be remembered that the share of the power supply of server cooling systems accounts for about half of the total power consumption of the data center worldwide, which grows from year to year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to Computer Weekly: the cumulative power consumption of the data center worldwide has quadrupled over the period from 2007 to 2013.  Experts predict that this figure will increase even more (almost twice again over the next 15 years). <br><br>  You should start to transfer server farms to more advanced and energy-efficient server cooling technologies in order to reduce operating costs. <br><br>  <b>Graphene can reduce the cost of electricity data centers</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85f/fac/fee/85ffacfee33844f98913d1784c539c50.jpg"><br><br>  A series of experiments were conducted by researchers at Stanford University.  Such experiments have shown the possibility of a radical reduction in the amount of electricity consumed by computing and telecommunications equipment. <br><br>  Scientists have concluded that the transition from the use of silicon in the production of memory chips to the manufacture of such microchips from graphene can help in solving this problem.  Reducing the energy consumption of chips will reduce their heat generation and, as a result, reduce the load on the cooling systems of servers in the data center. <br><blockquote>  A cleaned relative of the lead of an ordinary pencil called graphene is formed when carbon atoms come together in sheets with a two-dimensional structure and a thickness of one atom.  Graphene is stronger than steel. In terms of conductivity, it is similar to copper, having a number of useful properties for the manufacture of nanoscale electronics. </blockquote><br>  Experiments conducted by scientists from Stanford University showed the possibility of manufacturing using non-volatile RRAM memory with graphene with high storage density and lower power consumption (compared to silicon analogues).  It is possible that their technology may be available on the market in the near future. <br><br>  It is known that graphene can be effectively used to remove heat from the working elements of electronic devices.  Jagannadhan Kasichaynula (Jag Kasichainula), a professor at North Carolina State University, created a unique composite of copper and graphene for heat distribution covers of microcircuits, which is attached to the crystals using an intermediate indie graphene film. <br><br>  <b>Control bubbles in boiling water will improve the efficiency of heat transfer</b> <br><br>  Systems of liquid cooling of servers are characterized by higher energy efficiency compared to traditional counterparts, which involve the forced injection of cooled air to the hot elements of server systems.  But despite the advantages of LSS, operators on server farms are still afraid to implement them at controlled facilities for security reasons.  Even if dielectric materials with very low electrical conductivity are used as a coolant in LSS, such danger is inherent. <br><br>  Thanks to the new technology, liquid cooling systems for servers can become even more efficient and, as a result, more attractive for data center operators. <br><br>  Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States are working on a technology that will control the mechanism of formation of bubbles at boiling point.  Streamlining of this process will allow to achieve a significant increase in the efficiency of heat exchange between the boiling liquid refrigerant and the cooled surface. <br><br>  A team of US researchers are now working with various surfactants that can change surface tension to achieve a more even and efficient boil using less energy. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>PS We conduct a campaign specifically for Habr's readers.</i>  <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/271219/">Post with the details here</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271289/</a></p>
