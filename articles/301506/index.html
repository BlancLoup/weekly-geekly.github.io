  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Generation 13, the fourth wave: entry-level Dell PowerEdge servers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Released in November 2015, PowerEdge entry-level servers provide more storage capacity and are offered in various configurations depending on the task.  They support four slots for installing DDR4 SDRAM memory modules (up to 64 GB of RAM) and up to four or eight hard drives depending on the model.  The new 13th generation Dell PowerEdge single-processor servers are focused on growing small and medium-sized companies, possessing the necessary performance, flexibility and expandability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93e/088/823/93e088823981410c93f211a8de7edd87.png"><br><br>  Small and medium-sized businesses operate in a complex, rapidly changing environment, and not everyone has the ability to support IT professionals.  Servers are equipped with a built-in Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC8) with Lifecycle Controller for full-featured remote management and with Dell OpenManage software, which also allows you to manage servers remotely.  In addition, Dell OpenManage software enables small companies to reduce implementation time by 40% and simplify management.  Thus, OpenManage will help the business (especially a beginner) to quickly and efficiently implement the server in the IT infrastructure.  And if you wish, you can outsource server management functions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/788/63c/e6b/78863ce6b78d4d5895f7fb1f58852366.png">

      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUX7_dpDU42k">New Dell servers</a> will help SMB enterprises increase productivity, move to more resource-intensive applications and increase operational efficiency.  The main differences between the four models are in their form factor and configuration possibilities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f9/666/09a/2f966609aefa438ca408391a57bff5c2.png"><br>  <i>From the 12th to the 13th generation.</i>  <i>Four new Dell PowerEdge server models have replaced the previous ones.</i> <br><br>  The R230 model is a good option for a hosting company offering a dedicated physical server to customers.  The powerful Dell PowerEdge R230 rack server can also be used to support decentralized applications in small and medium businesses. <br><br>  The Dell PowerEdge R330 Universal Rack Server with an extensible storage subsystem is suitable for organizations opening a branch office.  It is designed for small companies, remote vials of large organizations and OEM customers. <br><br>  The powerful Dell PowerEdge T130 tower server for small offices makes it easy to use office applications and collaboration tools. <br><br>  The Dell PowerEdge T330 rack-mount tower server is designed for future growth and is designed for small and medium businesses, departments, and remote offices of large organizations that need to store large amounts of data. <br><br>  As they grow, organizations can add new Dell PowerEdge servers with other Dell hardware and software, as well as Dell services. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>13th generation</b> </td><td>  <b>The main difference from the previous generation server</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Dell PowerEdge R330 </td><td>  Provides 56% more disk capacity. </td></tr><tr><td>  Dell PowerEdge R230 </td><td>  It supports twice the RAM, three times the internal disk capacity and twice the number of I / O ports. </td></tr><tr><td>  Dell PowerEdge T330 </td><td>  Supports four DDR4 connectors and eight 3.5-inch hard drives. </td></tr><tr><td>  Dell PowerEdge T130 </td><td>  Supports twice as much RAM. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  The presented models distinguish not only the new Intel Xeon E3-1200 v5 series processors and DDR4 memory, which is 33% faster than DDR3 memory, but also the almost doubled bandwidth, which was made possible by the transition to the I / O interface of the PCIe 3.0  In practice, this means an increase in the speed of a wide range of applications, a decrease in the response time of the system, a reduction in the processing time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/156/4b8/ed7/1564b8ed76a444eab5327c29e0a069fc.png"><br><br>  DDR4 memory modules with a frequency of 2133 MHz (against 1600 for DDR3) have 30% more bandwidth, while their power consumption is 30% less in active mode and 50% in standby mode.  When using 64GB DIMM modules, the capacity of the server's RAM will double compared with the previous generation. <br><br>  The double IOPS (input / output operations per second) doubled (750 instead of 375), which was facilitated by the Dell PERC9 controller (PowerEdge RAID Controller 9) with support for RAID technology, which replaced the previous PERC8 controller.  To install hard drives (or drives of other types) servers provide four to eight bays (depending on configuration), and this is a large enough capacity for storing data in budget systems.  A wider choice of network adapters allows you to more flexibly configure servers for different tasks. <br><br>  Finally, support for Fresh Air 2.0 technology allows servers to operate at a higher temperature and thereby save on cooling. <br><br>  New models are ready to deploy virtual environments and support Microsoft Windows Server with Hyper-V, VMWare vSphere ESXi and Citrix XenServer (R330 also supports the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization hypervisor). <br><br>  Let us consider in more detail each of the four models. <br><br>  <b>R330</b> <br><br>  The main purpose of this server is web hosting and e-commerce, work with files and printing, support for applications and systems of collective activities, desktop consolidation and virtualization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea5/a94/b59/ea5a94b59ede4506830201de2d2f6869.png"><br><br>  New storage options: two 1.8 ‚ÄùSSDs in the ODD bay speed up system loading, and four 3.5‚Äù or 2.5 ‚Äùform factor disks can be used in the server storage subsystem.  In the latter case, a special adapter case is used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12f/73a/b18/12f73ab183b442d6ac15674fc02cdf06.png"><br><br>  In a non-SSD configuration, 6 HDD 2.5 ‚Äùcan be installed in the case: SATA 7.2K, SAS 15K, Near Line SAS 7.2K or SAS 10K. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/066/548/f07/066548f07a114a34a185662d6a2959ef.png"><br><br>  Alternatively, four 3.5 ‚ÄùEnterprise SATA 7.2K drives or Near Line SAS 7.2K drives.  Disk drives are replaced in hot mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8d/9d5/26d/c8d9d526d89a4272befe8bff32dda070.png"><br><br>  The third option: two SSD 1.8 ‚Äùand four HDD 3.5‚Äù SATA / SAS 7.5K. <br>  Server stuffing: Intel E3-1200V5 processor, up to four DDR4 UDIMM ECC memory modules (dual-channel DIMM) of 4, 8, or 16 GB, hot-swappable 250 W power supply.  On the server case there are two USB 3.0 ports in the back and two USB 2.0 ports in the front, as well as one internal USB 3.0 port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7c/e7b/057/d7ce7b057ffc4d5da6186273db9fa162.png"><br>  <i>Compare servers R320 and R330.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09a/bd5/9a5/09abd59a522845e584c0f4f59033eb87.png"><br>  More efficient design and better heat dissipation allowed the use of four fans instead of five. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/535/136/48c/53513648c74c4c009b6ffa4c001ed70d.png"><br>  It looks like the R330 inside.  The inside of the R330 server is very similar to the R230 minus the backup power supply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fda/a53/8b7/fdaa538b7b2a435f9d0b1b7e87f85c36.png"><br>  Behind the R330 are the serial port and VGA port, the power supply is located on the right (there is no backup in this model), in the center is a single-port 1Gb Base-T adapter, to the left is a two-port Broadcom 1Gb Base-T adapter, two USB 3.0 ports and a network port. <br>  This server will compete with HP ProLiant DL120 Gen9 and Lenovo System X3250 M5 systems and will strengthen Dell‚Äôs position on the world market for single-processor rack-mount servers, where the company leads with a share of 33.8%. <br><br>  <b>R230</b> <br><br>  We now turn to R230, an entry-level uniprocessor rack server for SMB enterprises and distributed offices of large organizations.  The purpose of this server is to support collaborative and productive applications, email and messaging systems, file collaboration and data protection, as well as desktop consolidation and virtualization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/278/eed/850/278eed8500944dc0ac558836e39553db.png"><br><br>  Let's see how the new model differs from the previous one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c6/0b3/f87/6c60b3f8774948708b4d1c4d40320ccb.png"><br><br>  Compare servers R220 and R230.  The new systems have significantly increased the density of the storage subsystem ‚Äî up to four hot-swap drives are supported. <br>  Three configurations are offered for this server: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a2/4e0/8e2/1a24e08e25bd46769206f12b8c23d1b1.png"><br><br>  The R230 with two 3.5 ‚Äùpluggable cable drives is a low-end, entry-level budget configuration for users with basic server storage subsystem requirements.  If you do not plan to support mission-critical applications, you can install inexpensive HDD drives designed for client systems, but they cannot be combined with enterprise-class HDDs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f25/3b0/401/f253b04017554ab9af2834f955862a3d.png"><br><br>  R230 with four pluggable 3.5 "cable drives - configuration with high density storage subsystem.  It also supports low-cost drives and is designed for customers who do not want to spend money on redundant features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d2/f8a/19d/2d2f8a19d4334229b6c202a8fd0d899c.png"><br><br>  R230 with four 2.5 ‚Äù/ 3.5‚Äù hot-swap disks, LCD display and iDRAC controller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c5/296/b52/6c5296b52bee4d6d8f8f529e98f07952.png"><br><br>  For a 2.3 ‚Äùdrive, such an adapter case is used, and you can install a SATA SSD into it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a6/9f1/591/3a69f159179e44aa86f6210707dc86f8.png"><br><br>  Behind the R230 server are the serial port and VGA port (left), power supply (right), Broadcom 1Gb Base-T four-port network adapter (center).  To the left are the dual-port Broadcom 1Gb Base-T adapter, two USB 3.0 ports and a network port, as well as two PCIe expansion slots. <br>  And now for the floor models. <br><br>  <b>T130</b> <br><br>  This server in a compact tower case works very quietly, which allows you to install it right in the office, and at the same time supports full-featured remote control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04d/f69/73a/04df6973a9c045ecaf9b0558f47014ba.png"><br><br>  T130 is a universal server for SOHO and small business.  It will do well with the role of a file server, a print server, it can be used to support applications and collaboration systems, e-mail and messaging systems, data collaboration, desktop consolidation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cc/0bf/95e/4cc0bf95ef33419c8cd27c272bbe951a.png"><br>  Differences server T130 from the previous model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b23/b7d/ca0/b23b7dca00c94d5e8c3ea200a49a44f7.png"><br>  It looks like the case behind.  Note that it is not designed for rack mounting and supports only 3.5 ‚Äùdrives - up to 4 HDD Enterprise SATA 7.2K, NL SAS 7.2K or SATA client drives.  In the case - two fans (1 + 1), power supply 290 W Bronze EPA. <br><br>  <b>T330</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/136/65d/35e/13665d35e80f4d7daf7847066f8d1165.png"><br>  On the case of the T330: <br>  Front panel: 2 x USB3.0 + 4 x USB 2.0 <br>  Back: 1 x USB 2.0 + 1 x USB 3.0 <br>  DVD drive and LCD display with server status information.  In the lower part there are compartments for HDD. <br>  The T330 is an entry-level, single-processor server in a tower housing, which can also be mounted in a rack.  It is distinguished by the means of ensuring high availability of the corporate class.  This is a server for SMB and remote offices (ROBO) of large organizations. <br>  Like the T130 model, it can be used as a file server, a print server, it can be used to support applications and collaboration systems, e-mail systems and messaging, work with data, and consolidate desktops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03f/570/096/03f5700961c54bcc935407c639766024.png"><br>  <i>Differences between T330 servers and previous generation servers.</i> <br><br>  The T330 single-processor server in the 5U package supports up to 8 3.5 "disks (or 2.5" in a special adapter adapter). ReadyRails are used for rack mounting. It allows you to easily slide the case out of the rack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/211/3d5/409/2113d5409d0a4a45ad8e979e7329ee6e.png"><br>  Behind the T330 are the serial port and VGA port, 2 USB 3.0 ports + 4 x USB 2.0 and two network ports.  On the right are power supplies (1 x 350 W or 2 x 495 W with redundancy).  In the center is a Broadcom 1Gb Base-T dual port adapter. <br><br>  <b>Control</b> <br><br>  About the controls should be discussed in more detail.  PowerEdge servers come with Dell OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) software and an OpenManage Essentials (OME) console console, which allows you to work with an Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller 8 (iDRAC8) controller with Lifecycle Controller software.  OSMA uses software agents to manage it.  With their help, you can perform administrative functions from the command line or the Web-based GUI, and iDRAC provides remote access to the system regardless of whether the OS is installed in it.  The System Summary page displayed by iDRAC allows administrators to see basic iDRAC information, monitor system status, run tasks, update firmware, view logs, turn on / off server power, and initiate iDRAC reset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e65/5bf/967/e655bf9675184557a92c773b28c2978d.png"><br><br>  The Fan Setup page allows you to set up a power consumption profile (Thermal Profile), change the default one to Maximum or Minimum Power (Performance per Watt Optimized).  Fan Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãOffset enhances server cooling, while the Minimum Fan Speed ‚Äã‚Äãin PWM option (% of Max) controls fan speed in more detail.  The CPU section shows the system status.  You can also use the OpenManage Mobile mobile application to work with Dell OpenManage Essentials. <br><br>  According to the results of <a href="http://www.storagereview.com/dell_poweredge_13g_r230_r330_t330_and_t130_review">independent testing</a> , PowerEdge 13G Wave 4 servers - two floor-standing (T130 and T330) and two rack-mount (R230 and R330) models - show high performance when running applications.  They allow you to combine SAS or SATA drives, have high bandwidth in data processing and IOPS performance.  In Sysbench and SQL Server tests, these single-processor servers are able to compete with four-processor systems, for example, the PowerEdge R230 with R930 and R920.  And the iDRAC and OpenManage management tools greatly simplify their deployment and maintenance.  And all this - at a very modest price. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301506/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301506/</a></p>
