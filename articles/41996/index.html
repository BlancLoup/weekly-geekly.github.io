After all, you use Google, is not it? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Google Trends shows how interested the public is this or that thing.  He does this using search query statistics.  It makes sense that what is being sought is the most interesting.  Enter a few key phrases separated by commas, the graph will simultaneously reflect the data on the first five. <br><br><h6>  Note: all pictures below are clickable;  when clicked - go to Google Trends with parameters like in the picture </h6><br><h3>  Desktop or laptop? </h3><br>  So, the first thing I would like to know is the physical parameters of the computer.

     <a href="http://www.google.com/trends%3Fq%3DDesktop%252C%2BLaptop%252C%2Bnetbook%252C%2BMacBook%26ctab%3D0%26geo%3Dall%26date%3Dall%26sort%3D0"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae6/806/07c/ae680607c093fe8c0931000a5bda0601.png"></a> <br><br>  Judging by the graphs, it will be a laptop.  Desktops cause less interest, and therefore will buy them less. <br><br>  Interest in MakBook is growing, MacBook Air spurred it.  However, so far his schedule shows that he is unlikely to be able to catch up with ordinary laptops in popularity in the near foreseeable future. <br><br>  Netbooks are not perceived by most as the ultimate dream, this is obvious.  At the same time, it is clear that netbooks "eat off" the interest of notebooks.  So, perhaps they will occupy a wider niche. <br><br>  The first conclusion: "dream computer" - a laptop. <br><br><h3>  CPU </h3><br>  What processor will he have on board? <br><br> <a href="http://www.google.com/trends%3Fq%3DIntel%252CAMD%26ctab%3D0%26geo%3Dall%26date%3Dall%26sort%3D0"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9fc/6c2/37f/9fc6c237fa69ce24ec79ef2d56ca2c77.png"></a> <br>  Intel enjoys a stable interest, and AMD farther and farther from the leader.  Will AMD be able to create a dream processor?  Let's look at.  For now, an Intel processor, with no options. <br><br><h3>  Video card </h3><br>  Not only gamers need a powerful graphics card, so let's see what happens on this front. <br><br> <a href="http://www.google.com/trends%3Fq%3DnVidia%252C%2BATI"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f5/a66/824/0f5a66824add8b5da9168ba4f05931c5.png"></a> <br>  Wow!  It is interesting that both lines repeat each other. <br><br>  I think the explanation is simple: as soon as the new nVidia model comes out, they immediately begin to compare it with ATI, and vice versa. <br><br>  It can be seen that they are going nostrils, and it is impossible to say exactly which of these companies will supply the video card for the ‚Äúdream computer‚Äù.  Well, this is very good: the competition of producers is useful for buyers. <br><br><h3>  operating system </h3><br> <a href="http://www.google.com/trends%3Fq%3DWindows%2BXP%252C%2BWindows%2BVista%252C%2BMac%2BOS%2BX%252C%2BUbuntu%26ctab%3D0%26geo%3Dall%26date%3Dall%26sort%3D4"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d68/faf/51a/d68faf51a0e4acec88793825ca683e15.png"></a> <br>  Mac OS X has a consistently low level of interest.  The explanation, from my point of view, is very simple.  Apple buyers do not perceive the OS separately from the computer, it is mainly of interest to programmers. <br><br>  The undisputed interest growth leader is Ubuntu.  You can see how each subsequent release increases interest in this OS.  But with the versions of Windows is not so obvious. <br><br>  The release of Vista at first aroused interest in it, however, it remained at a consistently low level.  Compared to her position, Windows XP is unshakable. <br><br>  Well, it is obvious that either a Ubuntu or Windows XP will be installed on the ‚Äúdream computer‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Programming language </h3><br>  In what language will the programs for this computer be written? <br><br> <a href="http://www.google.com/trends%3Fq%3DC%252B%252B%252CC%2523%252CJava%252CPHP%252CDelphi%26ctab%3D0%26geo%3Dall%26date%3Dall%26sort%3D0"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/648/f0f/83b/648f0f83b80ad19b4f4b17a18c76fbeb.png"></a> <br>  Apparently, not on Delphi. <br><br>  It is obvious that interest in Java cannot be caused only by the island of Java, which means that the Java language is very popular. <br><br>  PHP is becoming less of an interest, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django are pressing up</a> . <br><br>  The C language is not listed, because Google Trends cannot separate the C language from phrases containing the letter ‚ÄúC‚Äù (names, titles), and the result cannot be interpreted.  C ++ has a stable interest in its niche. <br><br>  We make a cautious conclusion - the situation will not change much over time, and the languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are popular today will also be used in the future. <br><br><h3>  For what ? </h3><br>  What will the computer be turned on for?  This is an interesting question, and Google gives us a very interesting answer! <br><br> <a href="http://www.google.com/trends%3Fq%3Dbusiness%252C%2Bprogramming%252C%2Bgame%252C%2Bmovie%252C%2Bporn%26ctab%3D0%26geo%3Dall%26date%3Dall%26sort%3D0"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12f/d4a/e3a/12fd4ae3ade9e97e5d5559e6115553e9.png"></a> <br><br>  First of all, it will be used to view pornography.  Interest in this topic has increased significantly over the past year.  It is difficult to say what it is connected with.  Perhaps the financial crisis has such a side effect. <br><br>  In second place - games and movies.  The third is business.  Moreover, interest in business falls with such powerful ‚Äúfailures‚Äù in the New Year's area. <br><br>  And finally, about programming.  Interest falls.  This means that programmers should treat each other very carefully, because there are less and less of them.  Let's live in peace! <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  So, Google Trends says that the ‚Äúdream computer‚Äù will be a laptop with Ubuntu OS or Windows XP, and it will be used mostly not for work.  In general, quite interesting conclusions. <br><br>  I hope this article has helped you become more familiar with the possibilities of Google Trends.  May the force be with you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41996/</a></p>
