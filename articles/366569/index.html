As a preventive measure, we are also free to choose at least electronic correctors, even special breathing sensors, even pillows with a heart rate monitor, or even corsets, and all this was once collected money for crowdfunding sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39e/ec7/f39/39eec7f390c949de963956fd1dd64851.jpg"><br><br>  Under the cut - a few links, gifs, photos and details <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Furniture</b>

      Massively "grabs" from office workers, as a sedentary lifestyle, low activity and that is all they do their job.  Therefore, for those who spend a lot of time at the desktop, there were a number of proposals. <br><br>  <i><b>TORAX</b></i> <br><br>  A fresh project of a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1272835140/torax">folding table</a> , behind which you can work standing or sitting, ‚Äúpushing‚Äù it so that both the back and the neck remain in good shape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f2/fd6/b46/0f2fd6b460e9497699f996fbe3b05e53.png"><br><br>  The device is designed from high-quality lightweight materials, and generally looks compact and mobile so that it can be taken from home to work, everywhere remaining in the right position. <br><br>  <i><b>A-Gravity Chair</b></i> <br><br>  The chair, the work with which ensures the correct position of the back, cervical vertebrae and feet.  Folding, mobile, made of non-slip materials, so that when working, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1370698497/a-gravity-the-modern-workstation/description">considering the design</a> , there was no need to put extra effort to sit on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2f/359/d2d/a2f359d2d6ef4c67aa084581c19fb98e.gif"><br><br>  The chair comes with a special table. <br><br>  <i><b>ChairBot - one foot here, the other there</b></i> <br><br>  Unsuccessful project, which was attended by experts from the Massachusetts Institute.  The chair assumed alternate standing on one leg, then on the other and was rather cumbersome. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/040/f7f/e9e/040f7fe9e8d54acdb7f5fb8d3d7a4f2a.png"><br><br>  Despite the blunder, there is a certain logic in this: one part of the muscles stays in good shape, while the second is in a more relaxed position, but inevitably a person should be tilted slightly to one side.  This is strange.  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/291165539/chairbot-no-back-pain">Project page</a> . <br><br>  <i><b>Freedomman chair</b></i> <br><br>  This is rather an art project, however, according to the creators, thanks to such a chair, the spine, while sitting, retains the same posture as if you were standing, as our body, according to the developer, is not intended so we sat.  These are all evolutionary flaws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55f/eba/510/55feba510254499a9428b286c4c091a5.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/929020713/the-freedman-chair-a-better-way-to-sit/description">Kickstarter</a> cost $ 500. <br><br>  <b>Sedentary lifestyle: in the office or in the car</b> <br><br>  Furniture - furniture, but there are still special "lining" and "litter" with a corrective function, as well as corrective / supporting devices.  A few words about them. <br><br>  <i><b>Posture md</b></i> <br><br>  The cushion, which is designed to ‚Äúcompensate‚Äù for potholes of modern office chairs or car seats, consists of a soft material mixed with a special gel, which allows you to maintain a smooth back and maintain the comfort of movements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba9/688/4ac/ba96884ac3a149b591c27071bd6439db.jpg"><br><br>  The creators <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/903643708/postureme/description">rely on the theory of muscle memory</a> , when with systematic help, our muscles become more and more independent, getting used to the correct position. <br><br>  A sedentary lifestyle accompanies us not only at work, but also on the way to and from it, as many have private cars.  A similar Posture MD device was suggested by the Backboard team. <br><br>  <i><b>Backboard</b></i> <br><br>  Mobile <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1195429919/backboardtm-improve-posture-and-comfort-when-sitti/description">support board</a> , which covers the hollow space, not allowing the spine to "fall" into it, thereby maintaining the balance between the vertebrae and preventing the formation of a hernia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53a/0e6/3c7/53a0e63c77304ee4813f02c2cc19182b.jpg"><br><br>  A small, durable and easy to install "helper" can be used even in the living room. <br><br>  <i><b>ARC</b></i> <br><br>  A device that <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/672590550/the-arc-neck-and-back-tension-relief-creates-perfe/description">can be used lying and sitting</a> , fixing on almost any chair or chair.  The goal is the same - to support the correct position of a flat back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39e/ec7/f39/39eec7f390c949de963956fd1dd64851.jpg"><br><br>  The device is designed for any parts of the spine, and, for example, 10-15-minute lying on it by the cervical section helps to relieve pain and relieve muscle tension.  At the end of the working day! <br><br>  <i><b>DTRAC</b></i> <br><br>  A similar exercise cushion helps people with a healthy spine to relieve pain and tension during a ten-minute "exercise." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f7/407/a22/0f7407a22ea54e82bcc6cbaf88753c74.gif"><br><br>  Under the exercises should be understood simply the process of rest on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dtracforall/dtrac-lie-down-and-feel-the-difference-in-10-minut">DTRAC</a> , placing the device under the lumbar. <br><br>  <b>Proofreaders</b> <br><br>  My favorite topic, about which we periodically <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/248856/">write in our blog</a> . <br><br>  <i><b>Lumo back</b></i> <br><br>  The history of the company LumoBodyTech, which is now produced by the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/lumo-lift-ustrojstvo-korrektirujuschee-osanku.html%3Futm_source%3Dlumo_gktms%26utm_medium%3Dlumo_gktms%26utm_campaign%3Dlumo_gktms">Lumo Lift tracker corrector</a> , began on Kickstarter with an electronic <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lumoback/lumoback-the-smart-posture-sensor/description">corrector for the waist</a> .  The device remembered a pose, and in case of violation, sent a vibro alert.  In addition, the history of the correct / incorrect position of the back was sent to the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ea/bf3/6ef/0eabf36ef3d74a2d8e7cd151709589ea.jpg"><br><br>  The device is quoted and copied, in particular, it is worth remembering the failed PosturePulse. <br><br>  <i><b>Posturepulse</b></i> <br><br>  Similar Lumo lumbar tracker, which is designed to return the back to its original position.  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/485034005/posturepulse-the-posture-sensor-worn-on-your-waist">A device with a motor</a> would come out rather primitive and, possibly, effective, and at the same time to a wider audience of users: since it did not have its own application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78f/26a/424/78f26a424c6e4c7983eeea5bdf4a1ee3.jpg"><br><br>  But did not come out. <br><br>  <i><b>Breath</b></i> <br><br>  Since the correct posture affects the work of many of our organs, and neurologists often ‚Äúthicken‚Äù, eliminating problems with breathing, the development of cardiovascular diseases, etc., it is logical to observe in this market also ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù gadgets, which should motivate to keep your back. <br><br>  <i><b>Prana</b></i> <br><br>  One of these is the miniature <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/771156004/prana-wearable-for-breathing-and-posture">wearable device Prana</a> .  Despite the fact that the device did not collect the required amount, the idea, in my opinion, was good: the device helped to take a better position for optimizing breathing in order to minimize back pain and avoid stress. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bce/ef1/21d/bceef121df004eb18e0dcb0bd744d53c.jpg"><br><br>  Prana could work with IOS and Android applications, where it would draw your attention to the statistics of correct and incorrect provisions. <br><br>  <b>Darma</b> <br><br>  Reduce stress and improve the quality of your sitting position will help a special pillow.  This <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/junhao/darma-sit-smart-for-a-healthy-body-and-mind/description">non-invasive tracker</a> helps to develop a correct posture and analyzes a number of indicators that it affects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/539/cd5/d62/539cd5d62bff454db323487c3aa2fccc.gif"><br><br>  In particular, it will show the quality of breathing, stress levels and heart rate.  The data will go to the application where the learning mode will be available. <br><br>  <b>clothing</b> <br><br>  It must be said that in medical practice, supporting corsets are not strongly ‚Äúrevered‚Äù, since the task of our muscles is to be able to support the spine independently, and the corset takes some of this work, after which the muscles can come into even more deplorable condition. <br><br>  And manufacturers began to take this into account. <br><br>  <i><b>Truposture</b></i> <br><br>  Smart T-shirt <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/improve-posture-reduce-back-pain-with-truposture">with Indiegogo</a> , which has sensors throughout the length of the spine and synchronizes with the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b0/770/914/2b07709144d249fbb2b5fd4554ecc623.png"><br><br>  The creators just clarify that you should not expect direct help and support from her, but on the contrary: the device trains your back, in the process of which you independently develop the correct posture.  In the end - posture is largely a matter of habit. <br><br>  <i><b>Smart back brace</b></i> <br><br>  Another " <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/smart-back-brace-ssb-posture-correcting-device">pseudo-corset</a> ", which, according to the developers, will help the user to independently come to the desired position, without supporting it artificially. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a81/5f8/018/a815f801827d4b4c840d6e471b5b6336.png"><br><br>  The explanation is necessary, because the form is the usual "cross" belt with a fastening on the shoulders, known to many from school.  However, a smart sensor is integrated into the belt, which itself is able to track the change of position and give a vibration.  Something it reminds. <br><br>  Something similar offers and <i><b><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/posture-transformer-antigravity-backpack">Posture Transformer</a></b></i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ec/df9/da6/8ecdf9da606e4f15bb75fbdf0e9b3184.jpg"><br><br>  One of the most successful projects-corsets - <i><b>GetBetterBack</b></i> <br><br>  The device is designed for those who spend a lot of time sitting, and consists of two parts: a belt on the knees and a "pillow" on the lower back: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b77/4c7/4ae/b774c74aeaf4400eb41e4d62177bec14.gif"><br><br>  It is difficult to understand how comfortable and safe it is, but the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1123408990/betterback-perfect-posture-effortlessly/description">success of the project</a> was impressive! <br><br>  <i><b>Percko</b></i> <br><br>  Another "belt" proposal that works without electronics.  The creators led the right dialogue that <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/778002582/percko-wear-it-and-get-perfect-posture%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">their invention</a> does not support your body, but only by stimulating muscles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78f/bf3/64f/78fbf364fd2941e5a90743249265fce1.gif"><br><br>  However, in the case of incorrect posture - you are provided with discomfort, which induces you to take the desired posture.  It is achieved by a specific design. <br><br>  As a conclusion, as usual, there are several truths that correct posture is important for a person, no matter how cool: correct saturation of lungs with oxygen depends on it, proper heart function, digestion and much more, but none of the devices will help us better than a doctor if talking about the back.  <b>Especially</b> in the case of problems already discovered.  For example, the same DTRAC is strictly forbidden for osteoporosis. <br><br><ul><li>  It <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/fitness/5-sovetov-chtoby-predupredit-ili-izbavitsya-ot-boli-v-spine-i-4-populyarnyx-zabluzhdeniya-kotorye-mogut-ubit-pozvonochnik.html">is written here</a> about how I was in the hospital with a hernia and what I remember. </li><li>  An interesting <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/259726/">post in our blog</a> , including about Arduino projects for posture.
