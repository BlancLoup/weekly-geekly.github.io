This word for Internet providers is usual, but for sites this is completely incomprehensible and unnecessary thing, because  Usually the hoster handles all this, and even for projects that have grown beyond the limits of shared, vds, dedicated, etc.  hosting is superfluous. <br><br>  But life is such that when not gigabytes begin to fly from you, but terabytes of traffic become important HOW exactly they reach the final consumers.  And the additional moments of everything for Novosibirsk are still the possibility of providing their resources with no tariff or at a normal speed (10 \ 100 Mbit), and not at the speed of a regular anlim. <br><br>  So, in the spring of 2008, I needed to give <a href="http://1nsk.ru/">1nsk.ru</a> traffic <a href="http://1nsk.ru/">directly</a> to Novosibirsk providers, and not through an intermediary in the form of Sibirtelecom (I would like to note a good intermediary).  The goodies that have been seen at the same time are not the use of the ISP's Internet channel, but as a result, all (*) providers happily said that this is super and contributes to the fact that they will be able to send traffic at a price or speed different from the usual Internet traffic.  By (*) is meant the provider Siberian Networks, which, speaking simply, did not grow together, I don‚Äôt know the reasons, maybe they should be checked with the management of the Siberian Networks company (this is relevant for Novosibirsk only, aha).

      Because  all telematics rulitsya my crazy hands, then began to study the question, what is all peering with what it, so to speak, eat.  By simple manipulations, it turned out the following can be confused directly with Novosibirsk providers in two ways: a) pull the wires from them to yourself (which is unrealistic) or b) use the traffic exchange point (NSK-IX), which was initially heard as NSC-9, and only then it was discovered that IX is not 9, but <b>Internet eXchange</b> . <br><br>  Negotiations with the Russian Research Institute for the Development of Social Networks (ROSNIIROS) with which we had relations since the 90s led to a new formula for happiness (peering with providers in Novosibirsk) - its own AS and connection to NSK-IX, in Moscow a similar structure - MSK-IX. <br><br>  AS, how much of this sound is for the heart of a Russian ... an incomprehensible and funny word is shorter. <br><br>  Initially, the desire to enter into all this was not, and the cry was thrown on <a href="http://developers.1nsk.ru/blog/185.html">http://developers.1nsk.ru/blog/185.html</a> which led only to disappointment. <br><br>  Next was a search through Google and Yandex, it is understood that AS is not an asshole without an S, but an Autonomous system, and this is a cell of the Internet in general.  This was followed by a correspondence with ROSNIIROS about connecting to nsk-ix, choosing a Data Center where you can get a link to them (currently, services are provided by Rostelecom, RTCOMM-Siberia, TTC for different costs and with different connection conditions) and many other technical issues .  In particular, one of the goals to get an AS is to get its block of provider-independent ip addresses, the so-called PI IP.  This is the block of addresses that is assigned to you, regardless of which DC you use, which provider you are connected to, etc.  By receiving your AS, you will be able to independently control how exactly subscribers of one or another provider will ‚Äúwalk to you‚Äù, of course, if there is more than one channel. <br><br>  Issuance of AS numbers can be handled by a number of organizations.  The easiest way is, if there are acquaintances from providers, then you should contact them if the provider has the LIR (Local Internet Registry) status, then he may, for some reasonable money, register AS and the subnet of addresses.  In practice, such a service is usually provided for the order of 8-11k rubles at a time by a number of organizations for registering an AS and / 24 provider independent network. <br><br>  Having chosen an organization, then the path lies on <a href="https://www.db.ripe.net/fcgi-bin/webupdates.pl">https://www.db.ripe.net/fcgi-bin/webupdates.pl</a> there it is necessary to register your organization, contact person and technical support, this data will be requested during registration of autonomy and it is better to register yourself , to be aware of all the data.  After a period of a couple of weeks to a month, the registrar will inform AS ***** and your subgrid. <br><br>  In this place a slight digression follows, since  when asked by all the familiar tsiskovods what to do now and how to live, they shrugged their shoulders and advised to buy devices for kilobaxes inside which ip is born, acquaintances were sent nafig. <br><br>  Further to write? <br><br>  This is a crosspost with <a href="http://developers.1nsk.ru/blog/304.html">1nsk.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56856/</a></p>
