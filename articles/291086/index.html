  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Darth Vader. Disgusting management guide</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <sup>¬© REDBAZ from deviantart</sup> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83e/597/79f/83e59779f0b34e0a9a47a1b5647ae62e.jpg" alt="gift" align="left"><br>  In the character of Darth Vader, we see the archetype of evil, a kind of quintessence of a villain and a formidable opponent, whom we like to hate, and an incredibly unambiguous negative hero.  Moreover, his masterful possession of the lightsaber only enhances antipathy.  Drawing an analogy with the story of George Lucas, one can see a certain anti-guide on management.  Let us recall this story and try to study the methods of the Sith in order to avoid success in business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Any appearance of Darth Vader in the frame is preceded by the sound of the portable life support system, which Anakin Skywalker was forced to wear, to compensate for serious injuries received in a duel with Obi-Wan.  Mechanical legs in heavy armored boots provided a heavy step, also heralding his arrival.  What to say about the legendary background "imperial march."  Everything is very impressive and compresses the psyche of subordinates. <blockquote>  In fact, it is sometimes useful to be an inconspicuous manager and also to overlook the work of employees when they are completely unaware of your presence. </blockquote><br>  Imperials never stay on the screen without the presence of their boss.  Vader is almost always there, panting in the back. <blockquote>  It is extremely difficult for staff to work when the boss, especially such, is nearby.  Close attention never and never added self-control.  It is much better to show some trust and let the workers take a bit of responsibility and take the initiative, the result will not take long. </blockquote>  Almost every one of his own, who made a mistake, Darth Vader stifles who with the help of the Force, and whom with just a hand. <blockquote>  In management, it is very important to be able to listen to your employees and consider points of view different from yours.  Although this does not at all mean that you have to agree with everything, it is always always useful to look at a problem or a task with other people's eyes, as a result of which your view may also undergo changes.  All the same, the result of the task is more important than strict compliance with the requirements of the leadership (although there are exceptions). </blockquote>  In some films of the series, Vader breaks his own, sort of like these promises.  Most likely, the Sith concepts of morality are somewhat different from the usual, so that their words are violated as easily as they are given, which can not but cause distrust. <blockquote>  Never make such a mistake.  The promise made to employees must be fulfilled.  A promise is a promise; employees must be able to trust their boss. </blockquote><br>  Lord Vader is very irritable and kills too many irritating subordinates. <blockquote>  This practice is great for the short-term satisfaction of his rage attacks, but is extremely destructive for long-term reputation.  Extreme cruelty with their employees will not add points to you.  The shortage of labor in such a situation literally punches a hole in the ranks of employees.  The difficulty of staffing, in turn, will not allow the company to fully meet the current market requirements. </blockquote><br>  Darth Vader, especially not bothering, changes the terms of the agreements after their conclusion. <blockquote>  In our reality, this can lead to legal problems, as well as the loss of important business partners. </blockquote><br>  He is pompous and rude. <blockquote>  No one in this way makes friends and because of this loses the opportunity to influence people who are capable of expanding the network.  No leader should not behave like this, no need to burn bridges behind you, cutting yourself off from employees. </blockquote><br>  It does not reliably protect its intellectual property.  None of the clones, of course, points a finger at Vader when he allowed the rebels to steal the plans of the Death Star because of his carelessness. <blockquote>  You can not blame the thieves of excessive commercialism, if the stolen valuables were kept carelessly. </blockquote><br>  He frivolously spends precious resources.  An incredibly expensive absolute imperial weapon - the Death Star, was put out of action by a handful of poorly organized rebels in the shortest possible time. <blockquote>  If you are thinking of investing in expensive equipment, make sure that you can use it properly, keep it in good condition after purchase, issue insurance on it, and train personnel to work with this equipment. </blockquote><br>  Lord Vader has neither family nor friends in the usual sense. <blockquote>  Maintaining a healthy and beneficial balance between work and personal life is an indispensable and important component in building any sustainable business, even an Empire. </blockquote><br><br>  Despite all this, it‚Äôs worth remembering that Darth Vader was once Anakin Skywalker, a promising young Jedi Knight.  Unlike many other bad guys Lukas, a part of the good is preserved in the soul of Vader, so in the process of watching movies you can see some actions committed by him that do not have a villainous status: <br><br>  At the beginning of the fifth episode, we learn that Vader is obsessed with finding his son, Luke Skywalker.  Participated in this event as much as the whole Imperial fleet.  When he captures Luke, it becomes clear that the Sith was planning to tempt his son.  After that, he would become his student and eventually replace his father.  Every good entrepreneur should plan everything, including the preparation of a successor to his post.

      Darth Vader never shies away from performing even the dirtiest work.  Also, any effective manager, should take on their shoulders the performance of any profile work, regardless of whether it is good or not.  Keep your hands "clean" will not succeed.  Dismiss in difficult times and hire when everything goes according to plan. <br><br>  The magnificent voice of James Earl Jones, the impeccable and unforgettable style of Vader can not be forgotten.  Just like in life, first impressions are calculated on the wrapper, and besides this, the manager simply sets the standard for his employees.  The behavior and appearance of employees correlate with the chef, rarely from the first moment, most often it takes time.  At the same time it is important that the manager always needs to keep the bar.  Employees can relax, the head has no right to do so. <br><br>  This Sith is hardworking and ambitious.  He never gives up, and because of this his numerous managerial flaws did not prevent him from occupying an extremely high position in the structure of imperial administration. <br><br>  Everyone likes this gloomy and oppressive guy on the screen, ask even someone who hasn't watched movies, everyone knows who Darth Vader is, but I think few people would want such a boss for themselves.  Now ask yourself, is there a vader particle in you? <br><br><h4>  Remember: the power of the Jedi Knight is the power of the universe;  but remember: anger, fear - all this leads to the dark side of power.  As soon as you take the first step along the dark path, you will no longer be able to wind down from it. <br><br>  May the Force be with you! </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291086/</a></p>
