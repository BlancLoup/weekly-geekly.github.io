It is a document and must be on the product.  If you see something with a price tag (no matter where and how it costs), you have the right to buy it for the price of it. <br><br>  <b>Example</b> : you are told that the stock has run out of stock.  You see one in a glass case in an airtight box under the ceiling, but with a price tag.  You have no right to refuse to sell it.

      <b>The second example</b> : when prices are updated, a price tag with the old price below can be left on the trading floor.  Is the price in the base different?  So what, here is your document.  If, all of a sudden, a price tag without a signature seal and there is no right price tag on such a product - register the violation.  Price tags must be at least on one product from the pack. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Price Attack </h4><br>  Be careful.  One of the schemes of divorce suggests that at the checkout you can be told that ‚Äúoh, the price tag is old, the price has changed‚Äù - and you get a little higher price.  Have you gone?  With a high probability, you were cheated, or you just participated in one form or another of shoplifting.  The simplest example was how it was done by someone to carry out the plan: an antivirus, along with laptops, was required to check, 100 pieces of which had to be sold a day. <br><br><h4>  Searches and the need to wrap things </h4><br>  In large stores such as Auchan, Tapes or Carousels, they only take goods out of the way.  I talked somehow with the bearer of one of the networks - he just beat his head against the wall and said: you understand, they see the camera.  They know that she is there.  And still carry, because "suddenly blow over."  So, they are carried away in pockets of clothes, packages, boxes for other goods cheaper, they replace packaging (only in the week right in front of me, a man tried to carry toothpaste for 300 rubles in a box of paste for 28 rubles).  All this makes the security men nervous and prone to doing a stance on any suspicious activity.  You need to know three things: <br>  - You can take any bags with you and not pack them. <br>  - You can not show your bag and check at the exit. <br>  ‚ÄúThe guard can't do anything to you but call the police.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Can not leave bags at the entrance </h4><br>  The store is not responsible for your luggage items.  And he has no right to keep you out of the trading room with them, despite the assurances of the guard.  The procedure is simple - if it rests, say: "but I do not want."  Usually this ends, but if it is very hard - call the administrator and register the violation.  This is 426 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, since the store does not have the right to refuse to sell you the goods (the bag in your hand is no reason).  Similarly - about the need to pack in a sealed bag.  My practice has shown that at the time of the beginning of the explanations, you should start writing a video (do not forget to say ‚Äúattention, the video is on‚Äù) - this significantly speeds up the procedure. <br><br>  Also at the exit, employees do not have to look at the check and check your things at the entrance-exit, this is the law.  For the <s>gifted, this is further clarified in paragraph 34 of the letter of the Committee of the Russian Federation on Trade ‚ÄúOn the approximate rules of operation of a retail enterprise and the main requirements for the operation of a small retail network‚Äù No. 1-318 / 32-9 dated March 17, 1994.</s>  <i>Doc is outdated, now we look directly at the rights of protection.</i>  If you do not like something - write to Rospotrebnadzor, the store will take out the brains, and a significant penalty will arrive. <br><br><h4>  You can take pictures </h4><br>  In addition to the usual rules about photos and videos in stores (public places), under the law on trade you have the right to record information about prices, and the store has no right to hide them.  Accordingly, if there is at least one price tag in the frame - you are in your right, and when you try to stop you, you can safely register the violation.  Information about prices, by the way, can not be a trade secret.  The practice is more severe: the farther from Moscow, the stronger they can play it. <br><br><h4>  Sale without issuing a check </h4><br>  In general, you personally are not much in danger, usually it is the seller‚Äôs attack on the store.  However, this may mean that you are selling something at an inflated price, or it is somehow difficult to sell.  A check is a proof of purchase, so it will be useful to you in case of return, warranty repair, and so on.  If the store is working on UTII, cash voucher is not needed, consider.  But the document on the sale still need to give you on demand. <br><br>  Please note that sometimes a check is not issued artistically: an employee can punch a price at the checkout (so that it appears on the screen to the buyer), but not print the check.  The cafe still has a beautiful method: they can issue a guest bill, but not bring a real one (with a fiscal mark - there must be letters OP at the bottom or this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/225607/">is the</a> symbol). <br><br>  My colleague once bought a sandwich in Subway, where the ad ‚ÄúIf you weren‚Äôt given a check, a sandwich for free‚Äù hung.  The night shift clerk said, "I won't give you a check, ok?"  "Yes, do not give."  And the final: "And the money?" - "So you yourself suggested - you treat!" <br><br><h4>  Picking attack </h4><br>  Often with the product comes with a battery, memory card, headphones and other trifles.  In a store or delivery, malicious couriers or sellers often like to keep such souvenirs for themselves.  When accepting goods from an online store or in an offline store with a removed thermofilm, compare the equipment with what you have in your hands.  Incomplete equipment - a reason not to buy at all or require replacement. <br><br><h4>  The acceptance of a normal product </h4><br>  The seller-attacker may not accept the goods with the removed package (in our area - often a phenomenon in small regional stores when returning the game with the film removed - they do not want to bother with the returns).  There is a clear return criterion - the saved equipment (it is indicated in the instructions) and the absence of traces of operation.  Removing the film is not a trace of exploitation.  By the way, you can generally bring the goods without packaging to the guarantee, despite the fact that under the conditions of the guarantee you may be asked to keep it. <br><br>  A variety of attacks on non-acceptance of goods is a refusal to return something under the pretext of a ‚Äútechnically complex device‚Äù.  So, everything that cannot be returned is clearly listed in the standard.  If you do not see a direct reference to your device or another product, you can return it. <br><br><h4>  Attack of excess goods </h4><br>  The goods can be sold by cash.  The most common example is a salesman-attacker can bring his own and sell it without a check.  From here and take the Chinese fakes in expensive lingerie stores, for example.  Or, alternatively, the seller can buy your product for the stock, and then gradually sell it past the store in the store.  In general, with the implementation of such an attack, you have every chance to get a fake, even in the official store. <br><br><h4>  Weighting attacks </h4><br>  I think the main thing is known to everyone - banal hanging.  Variants of the sea - from a translucent package on the scales (from which the scotch stretches) to sly engineering systems with pedals.  You can simply punch the wrong amount per kilogram.  On the market, there are always control scales, in the store ‚Äî always to watch what you are being punched through and how (you can safely put the goods on the scales again and rejoice at the lingering faces of the malicious sellers).  From the point of view of the owner, a nice gift is that even simple electronic scales often have logs that can be compared with the actual movement of goods and the time of checks. <br><br>  Favorite phrase from the market: ‚ÄúWell, why didn't you immediately say that you would go to the controls?‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Sale of promotional goods (derivatives, ref-products) </h4><br>  Many shops give promotional products that need to distribute or give.  Understandably, an awesome plan - to make money on them and sell.  Often found on all sorts of energy, chocolates and cigarettes with the label "promo" or "not for sale."  In general, there is no difference as a buyer.  However, it becomes a little worse if special derivative lots go on sale (such as TV sets with reduced resolution - for depreciation in display cases), or REF equipment (a withdrawn and repaired marriage under the guise of a new one).  By the way, the store is obliged to clearly mark any marriage markdowns when you buy with it (it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúwork very well‚Äù, but clearly mark it) - and if you are denied a refund, register the violation. <br><br><h4>  Raising prices to sell </h4><br>  Purely Russian way to make a bigger discount.  A day before the sale we raise the price, then we write a 50% discount.  It works great for coupon services (they have minimum discount requirements) and is used on Black Friday.  Help - verification of logs and search for the same product in the web archive.  Or from competitors.  There was a topic on Habr√© about the behavior of Russian retail on ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Partial certificates </h4><br>  "Giving 1000 rubles to the account for registration" - a familiar picture?  At the bottom there is a small written about the conditions of use, and even lower and even smaller - that you can only pay up to 15-20% of the amount of the check.  That is, they give you 3-4 discounts of 20% for registration.  Everything.  Another great topic is ‚Äú1 ruble = 1 point‚Äù, and then write somewhere far away that for every ruble spent, 1 point is given, and 30 points are equal to five rubles.  It is assumed that the user does not read beyond the title, and if he reads, it is difficult for him to consider. <br><br><h4>  Label plywood </h4><br>  Hard attack, which is used for various purposes.  Most often - to change the shelf life of the goods.  Labeling the label is obviously cheaper than buying a new product with an incomprehensible shelf life like a bottle of mineral water.  The most unpleasant example that I saw was when sellers in another city exposed the whole network of eco-friendly fresh goods of one of my friends, simply changing the labels on expired milk. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Yes, there are two more points about surrender.  First, in the cafe they can clamp it for a very long time, hoping that you will leave.  In this case, after 5-7 minutes, it is enough to call the administrator and write down ‚Äúdid not give change‚Äù to the book of complaints and suggestions.  The second point - the trick ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any exchange‚Äù in the stores does not go down.  You must give a change from any amount, this is a standard. <br><br>  I am sure that you have a couple of fabulous stories from the practice on the issues described - and there is something to add.  Share, please. <br><br>  UPD.  There are many stories in the comments, but you should pay special attention to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/225607/">this</a> post from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ikar49/" class="user_link">IkaR49</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225607/</a></p>
