  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Before the New Year, the State Duma will introduce from 3 to 10 years in prison for viewing hentai</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last week, the decision was made to adopt the well-known Mizulina‚Äôs dusty two last years: <br><blockquote>  propose to adopt the bill in the first reading (proposed date of consideration of the State Duma is 09.12.2014) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ca/2ea/75c/6ca2ea75cd304107ab8d0452118d2057.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the link you can read the original text and feedback from the committees: <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/(Spravka)%3FOpenAgent%26RN%3D113185-6">a bill card on the State Duma‚Äôs website</a> . <br><br>  Well, let's make it clear that this particular lady was in store for us this time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Firstly, actresses in school uniforms, as well as stories and hentai, are now becoming real child pornography: <br><blockquote>  The materials or objects with pornographic images of minors in this article and article 2422 of this Code are understood to be pornographic materials and objects containing a naturalistic image or description of the genital organs of a minor or a minor, including actually performing or imitating sexual intercourse or other sexual activities, and the same actions committed with or with the participation of a minor, or an adult,  of a juvenile who actually commits or imitates sexual intercourse or other acts of a sexual nature. </blockquote>

        </script>
      <br>
      Secondly, the penalty for viewing or storing for personal purposes will exceed the penalty for grievous bodily harm. <br><br>  This inconspicuous paragraph: <br><blockquote>  b) set forth the first paragraph of part two as follows: <br>  ‚Äú3.  The acts provided for in the first or second part of this article, committed: ": <br></blockquote><br>  After substitution in the current version of the article imperceptibly turns into ... <br><blockquote>  1. Making, purchasing, storing and (or) moving across the State Border of the Russian Federation in order to distribute, publicly display or advertise, or distribute, publicly display or advertise materials or objects with pornographic images of minors - shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of two to eight years with the deprivation of the right to occupy certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to fifteen years or without such. <br><br>  2. Production, acquisition, storage and (or) movement across the State Border of the Russian Federation without the purpose of distribution, public demonstration, advertising of materials or items with pornographic images of minors - <br>  shall be punished with imprisonment for up to four years with deprivation of the right to hold certain posts or engage in certain activities for up to ten years or without it. ‚Äù; <br><br>  3. The acts provided for in the first or second part of this article, committed: <br>  a) in respect of a person who is under the age of fourteen; <br>  b) by a group of persons by prior agreement or by an organized group; <br>  c) with the extraction of income on a large scale; <br>  d) with the use of mass media, including information and <br>  telecommunication networks (including the Internet), are punished with imprisonment for a term of three to ten years with the deprivation of the right to <br>  certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to fifteen years <br>  either without it and with restriction of liberty for a period of up to two years or without one. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Total, simple browsing on the Internet is always an aggravating circumstance and is punished by ‚Äúimprisonment for a term of three to ten years with the deprivation of the right to occupy certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to fifteen years or without such restriction of freedom for up to two years or without such. " <br><br>  The feedback from the committees states that by the second reading, they will most likely remove the definition of child pornography, but leave everything else behind. <br><br>  However, our dear Roskomnadzor has long defined hentai as child pornography and brought to court about a hundred cases.  Basically, these are Vkontakte users who have posted similar pictures on their pages or in groups. <br><br>  So, most likely, these ridiculous 10 years for storing images will take effect on January 1. <br><br>  Pedolobi must have been destroyed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284914/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284914/</a></p>
