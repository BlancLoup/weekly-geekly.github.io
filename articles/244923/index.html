Snapshot technology was first invented (and patented) in 1993 by NetApp, and the word Snapshot ‚Ñ¢ itself is its trademark.  Snepsotsionnaya technology logically stemmed from the mechanisms of the <abbr title="Write Anywhere File Layout">WAFL</abbr> file structure.  <a href="http://blog.aboutnetapp.ru/archives/282">Why WAFL is not a file system,</a> see here.  The point is that <abbr title="Write Anywhere File Layout">WAFL</abbr> always writes new data ‚Äúto a new place‚Äù and simply rearranges a pointer to the contents of new data to a new place, and old data is not deleted, these data blocks that are not marked with pointers are considered released for new records.  Thanks to this recording feature, ‚Äúalways in a new place‚Äù, the snapshot mechanism was easily integrated into <abbr title="Write Anywhere File Layout">WAFL</abbr> , which is why such snapshots are called Redirect on Write (RoW).

    <h4>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244923/">Snapshots</a> </h4><a name="snapshots"></a><br>  Due to the fact that snapshots are copies of inodes (links) to data blocks, and not the data itself, and the system never writes to the old place, snapshots in NetApp systems do not affect <abbr title="Write Anywhere File Layout">WAFL</abbr> performance at all. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/513/4d4/e7b/5134d4e7b84e48cb950918951c971f38.png"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244923/">Cow</a> </h4><a name="cow"></a><br>  After a while, the functionality of ‚Äúlocal snapshots‚Äù turned out to be in demand by other equipment manufacturers, this is how <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8">COW</a> snooping technology was invented.  The difference of this technology lies mainly in the fact that all other file systems and block devices, as a rule, did not have a built-in recording mechanism ‚Äúto a new place‚Äù, i.e.  old data blocks are overwritten when they are overwritten: the original data is overwritten, and new data is written in its place.  And in order to prevent snapshot damage after such rewriting, a dedicated area is provided for safe storage of snapshots.  So in the case of rewriting data blocks in the file system that are related to snapshots, such a block is first copied into the space reserved for snapshots, and new data is written in their place.  The more such snapshots, the more additional parasitic operations, the greater the load on the file system or block device, and as a result, the entire disk subsystem and possibly the entire <abbr title="Storage System">storage system</abbr> . <br>  In this connection, most manufacturers of <abbr title="Storage System">storage</abbr> and software as a rule have recommendations to have no more than 1-5 snepshots.  And on high-load applications, it is generally recommended not to have snepshots or delete the only one necessary for backup, as soon as it is no longer needed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e86/376/d60/e86376d604a14e209df6941303c92d01.png"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244923/">Backup Approaches</a> </h4><a name="backup_approach"></a><br>  There are two approaches in backup copying: ‚Äúpure software‚Äù and ‚ÄúHardware Assistant‚Äù.  The difference between the two is at what level the snapshot will be performed: at the host level (software) or at the <abbr title="Storage System">storage</abbr> level (HW Assistant). <br><br>  "Software" snapshots are performed "at the host level" and at the time of copying data from the snapshot, the host may experience a load on the disk subsystem, <abbr title="Central Processor Unit">CPU</abbr> and network interfaces.  Such snapshots tend to perform in "off-peak" hours.  Software snapshots can also use the <abbr title="Copy on Write">COW</abbr> strategy, which is often implemented at the file system level or some file structure that can be managed from the host <abbr title="Operating system">OS</abbr> .  An example of this could be <abbr title="Extended Filesystem version 3 with Copy on Write">ext3cow</abbr> , <abbr title="B-tree file system">BTRFS</abbr> , <abbr title="Veritas File System">VxFS</abbr> , <abbr title="Logical Volume Manager">LVM</abbr> , <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do%3Flanguage%3Den_US%26cmd%3DdisplayKC%26externalId%3D1015180">VMware snapshots</a> , etc. <br><br>  Snapshots in <abbr title="Storage System">storage systems</abbr> are often the basic functions for backup.  And despite the lack of <abbr title="Copy on Write">COW</abbr> , when used with Hardware Assistant snapshots at the <abbr title="Storage System">storage</abbr> level, you can somehow live by loading only the <abbr title="Storage System">storage</abbr> and not the entire host at the time of the backup, and then immediately remove the snapshot so that it does not load the <abbr title="Storage System">storage</abbr> . <br><br>  So here.  Everything is relative. <br>  Since NetApp has no performance issues due to snapshots, snapshots <i>have become the basis for the backup paradigm for <abbr title="Fabric-attached storage">FAS</abbr> <abbr title="Storage System">storage systems</abbr></i> .  Since <abbr title="Fabric-attached storage">FAS</abbr> systems can store up to 255 snapshots per volium, we can recover much faster if our data is locally.  After all, it is very convenient and quick to recover if the data for recovery is local, and recovery is not copying data, but just rewriting pointers to the ‚Äúold place‚Äù.  It is worth noting that, with other manufacturers, the <i>theoretically</i> possible number of snapshots <i>can reach thousands</i> , but after reading the documentation for use you can make sure that <b>using <abbr title="Copy on Write">COW</abbr> snapshots on high-load systems is not recommended</b> . <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244923/">The difference in approaches</a> </h4><a name="the_difference_in_approach"></a><br>  So what is the difference between NetApp approaches and other manufacturers who also use snapshots as a basis for backup?  NetApp seriously uses local snapshots as part of its backup and recovery strategy, as well as for replication, while other manufacturers cannot afford this because of the overhead in the form of performance degradation.  This makes significant changes to the backup architecture. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f0/ead/661/0f0ead661f714bf690a1740945f08540.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244923/">Application &amp; Crash Consistent Backups</a> </h4><a name="acb_and_ccb"></a><br>  The shots taken "by themselves" provide a Crash Consistent recovery, i.e.  Having rolled back on such a once taken snapshot, the effect will be as if you pressed the Reset button on the server with your application and loaded.  In order to provide Application Consistent Backup, the <abbr title="Storage System">storage system</abbr> must interact with the application in order for it to properly prepare the data before snapshot.  The interaction between the <abbr title="Storage System">storage system</abbr> and the application can be ensured with the help of agents installed on the same host where the application itself lives. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/599/882/46b/59988246b8c542a7aa22f3a4f5e6e833.jpg"><br><br>  There are a number of backup software that can interact with a large set of applications (SAP, Oracle DB, ESXi, Hyper-V, MS SQL, Exchange, Sharepoint) that support HW Snapshoots on NetApp <abbr title="Fabric-attached storage">FAS</abbr> systems: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/279891/">Veeam Backup &amp; Replication</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/280009/">CommVault Simpana</a> </li><li>  NetApp SnapManager / SnapCenter.  About <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/230191/">SnapManager for Oracle for SAN</a> network, you can read in the relevant article </li><li>  NetApp <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/244677/">SnapProtect</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.aboutnetapp.ru/archives/tag/snapcreator">NetApp SnapCreator</a> (free framework) </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/280021/">Symantec NetBackup</a> </li><li>  Symantec BackupExec </li><li>  Syncsort </li><li>  Acronis </li></ul><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244923/">Disaster protection</a> </h4><a name="disaster_recovery"></a><br>  To ensure physical fault tolerance, there are many mechanisms that reduce the likelihood of a local backup failing - <abbr title="Redundant Array of Independent Disks">RIAD</abbr> , component duplication, path duplication, etc.  Why not use hardware fault tolerance that is already present?  In other words, snapshots are backups that protect against logical data errors, accidental deletion, corruption of information by a virus, etc.  The Nepshots do not protect against the physical failure of the <abbr title="Storage System">storage</abbr> system itself. <br><br><h5>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244923/">Thin Replication</a> </h5><a name="Thin_Replication"></a><br>  To protect against physical destruction (fire, flood, earthquake, confiscation), the data still needs to be backed up to a spare site.  The standard backup approach is that the full amount of data will be transferred to a remote site.  A little later came up with a compress this data.  It is worth noting that the mechanism of compression (and extraction) of data requires a significant expenditure of <abbr title="Central Processor Unit">CPU</abbr> resources.  Then transfer only the increments, a little later we came up with reverse incremental backups (so as not to waste time collecting increments into a full backup at the time of recovery), and for reliability periodically transfer the full set of data. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e47/91b/865/e4791b865e2447ffb01e017349c94d8d.png"><br><br>  And here, too, come to the aid snapshots.  They can be compared with reverse incremental backups that do not require a long time to create them.  So, for the first time, NetApp systems transfer a complete set of data, and then, always, only a snapshot (increment) to a remote system, increasing the speed of backup and recovery.  Along the way, it is possible to enable compression of the transmitted data. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a8/805/699/5a880569953944748f86c331e1cb5361.png"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244923/">Copy Data Management</a> </h4><a name="Catalog_and_Testing"></a><br><a name="CDM"></a><br>  Using the same data for several tasks, such testing backups using cloning (and others) began to gain popularity and is called Copy Data Management (CDM).  On the ‚Äúnon-productive‚Äù site from a clone, it is also convenient to perform cataloging, backups verification, as well as <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/280105/">testing and development based on thin clones of</a> reserved data. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc7/609/679/dc7609679fde462baf9541abec1144fa.png"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244923/">Backup paradigm</a> </h4><a name="the_DR_paradigm"></a><br>  Thus, the backup paradigm in NetApp <abbr title="Fabric-attached storage">FAS</abbr> <abbr title="Storage System">storage</abbr> consists of sets of approaches to: <br><ul><li>  Removing consistent snapshots long stored, both locally on the same <abbr title="Storage System">storage system</abbr> and remotely </li><li>  Thin Replication for archiving / backing up and restoring </li><li>  Thin Cloning for testing </li></ul><br><br>  The above allows you to have no performance problems, more quickly and consistently take pictures (reduce the backup window) and replicate data (and, as a result, be able to make backups more often) without stopping to maintain, even during working hours.  Recovering from a remote site is much faster, using snapshots, transferring only the ‚Äúdifference‚Äù between the data, and not the full copy.  And local snapshots in case of logical data corruption, allow reducing the recovery window to a couple of seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc9/4d5/4af/fc94d54afbf54f8b8d10a51985d5bd2a.png"><br><br>  <b>I ask to send messages on errors in the text to the <abbr title="Private message">LAN</abbr> .</b> <br>  <b>Notes and additions on the contrary please in the comments</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244923/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244923/</a></p>
