The feeling that had previously, at least in the past few years, had not disturbed him. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy did Lenka have to take this expensive car?  In Israel, we don‚Äôt meet with some unfold acquaintances, on the contrary, my guys - and indeed the entire Israeli public - are hostile to the protrusion of their high level of income.  Could manage the E-class, or even take the ‚ÄúVolkswagen‚Äù or ‚ÄúToyota‚Äù! ‚Äù <br><br>  He reflected on this strange topic for him, looking alternately at the landscape outside the window, then at the back of the head of their driver, Sasha Korolchenko.  Handsome, karate, performs part-time bodyguard role - this is mainly for Lenka.  There are serious suspicions that this pepper is providing some other services to his little wife.  But jealousy, which in the first months of their novel with Helen spilled out of his furious heart with red-hot lava, froze with a thick crust of despair and hopelessness.

      A significant role in cooling this lava was played by his close friend, the well-known and fashionable Moscow psychoanalyst Slava Vestminstrov.  Halperin spent taking off a lot of inflamed hours in a soft leather chair, and his smart friend managed to convince Dima of a very simple and cynical thing: such as Elena, it was impossible to keep him by force, expensive things or highly moral speeches.  The wind does not live in the dungeon.  Let go of the reins - she will be caught in the open spaces, bruises, will cut herself on the sedge of the realities of the surrounding society and will return to the comfort of relationships and material well-being herself.  Well, of course, we‚Äôll outline the borders with you, and if the girl eats the coils completely, we‚Äôll simply block her in your little head. <br><br>  This last promise became the main pacifier of Dimkina in love schizophrenia.  Lena did not intend to move off the coils, she behaved quite pragmatically, surprisingly combining this pragmatism with provocativeness on the thinnest, shaky border of the possible.  Therefore, the lava under the thick gray crust has never completely cooled down, but as soon as this hot cat touched his cheek with soft warm lips, it cost him to smell her, the smell of the meadow heated by the spring sun, some kind of freshness that didn‚Äôt fit into the cunning secret intrigue, betrayal, dishonesty of every kind, and Dimka melted away like a teenager from the touch of a woman's breast.  At such moments he was ready to forgive everything, to spit on any rumors, gossip and suspicions. <br><br>  - Dmitry Semenovich!  Elena Vladimirovna is waiting for you in the Hilton.  I first brought it to the hotel, and then for you, we immediately go there to her? <br><br>  - Yes, Sasha, of course. <br><br>  Scrooge.  Dima smiled.  Yes, the guys came up with such a cry.  He is really rich, but in recent times a small cloud of uncertainty is far away, at the very edge of the horizon ‚Äî no, no, but also manifested in the subconscious.  And this flashed thought - rent an expensive car - it is from there, from this cloud. <br><br>  - Dimochka!  And why should we fly to London on these broken-down Aeroflot ‚ÄúBoeing‚Äù?  After all, we have the opportunity, just like our neighbors, to get a ‚Äúbird‚Äù for ourselves, which will make us independent from the airshows, the nursery grounds of any contagion!  As soon as I fly with them, even for a short distance, some virus will definitely pick up.  I was told that private planes are parked at Domodedovo, and fly to London in three and a half hours. <br><br>  The Rublevsky mansion became the starting point for all these ideas, projected by girlfriends from the near Rublevsky "mezhdusoboychik" on Lenkina's psyche, susceptible to this kind of information. <br><br>  Such dialogues led to the acquisition of the Hawker Beechcraft light American jet aircraft.  This "light" plane cost him almost five million dollars, to which were added the cost of his parking and maintenance at London Airport "Biggin Hill".  Well, and then on the stencil: a villa in Marbella and a yacht in the near marina.  He acquired his office and apartment in London before he was in the circle of her loved ones, such gentle and tenacious hands. <br><br>  The games, which initially brought in millions, gradually began to reduce their profitability, a new project was needed, and he had already entered his starting phase, but at the same time the costs had increased significantly.  Specialists who started with him as enthusiasts almost all went into companies with earnings incomparable with what Dmitry could offer.  He was forced, in order to keep those without whom he could not manage, to raise the corresponding rewards.  His monthly expenses for the maintenance of the company and the maintenance of all this movable and immovable property approached two million dollars, had to use loans, and interest added a significant headache to expenses.  And what is most alarming is that the new project does not guarantee one hundred percent success; competitors are running fast, no matter how they stumble before the finish. <br><br>  - In vain I did not stay with the guys.  Lenka would have waited, not sour.  Why should I so unquestioningly obey her wishes, and even learn about them from my own driver? <br><br>  The irritation intensified with every minute, and Dmitriy nearly ordered to turn the car in the opposite direction.  But the attraction of Lenkin's gaze ... Halperin, grinning, mentally interrupted himself. <br><br>  No, it sounds beautiful, of course - look!  But all the same, most of all, without a miss, their round knees, tight ass and pointy nipples crowning two mounds of perfect shape ‚Äî not too big but perfect ‚Äî so that he could bury his face and get lost in this stupefying, beat him under the spoon soft, silk enjoyment.  This attraction of the flesh always won, especially since he had not seen her for a whole week, and that was for him a long time.  Nowhere guys from him will not disappear.  See you later.  We must not miss the opportunity to work with them.  These clever men are able to come up with something worthwhile, worth investing in.  And this is big money, and this is its advantage over them.  With these soothing thoughts, he continued to contemplate the slopes of the foothills of the Golan Heights. <br><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/292897/">Next chapter</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373799/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373799/</a></p>
