It is quite logical to assume that soon the tired of ‚Äújuggling‚Äù of diskettes, of the toy that was traversed (and of the found sys c: command, which markedly accelerated the total time for passing the game =)) with might and main carried away by ‚Äúpassed‚Äù then at school what do I mean <br><br>  And, by virtue of its limited capabilities at that time (this was the year 2000), this computer taught me one nice thing, software is not obliged, more precisely it shouldn‚Äôt EAT as much as it started to eat little by little in terms of technical requirements, thanks to that ‚Äúfossil‚Äù "As others called it, I actually understood what high-quality software is, I saw such cute things as DOS text processors, Visi On and other artifacts from the era when" 4s were servers, and Pentium would create cyberspace "

      And I didn‚Äôt regret for all this for a minute, neither about 16 color ultima 5, nor about turbopascale 7.0 (the programs of which were not launched on computers more powerful than 200 Hz due to division by zero), nor about fribsd 2.2 and turbolinux based on the 4th redhat, nor about those times when I had a downgrade to the Hercules Graphics Card, yes, yes, black and orange textmod and 720 √ó 348 ... <br>  I only regret that once a year, or maybe two years ago, I lost my temper and brought you out of place due to lack of space in the garbage bin ...
