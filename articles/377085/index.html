    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Hammerhead is an interactive direction indicator.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7cb/c74/c0b/7cbc74c0bfa94503abc2beed5762ea55.png"><br><br>  Bicycle navigators invented and created a mass of various types and various functionalities.  It would seem that here you can still invent?  It turns out that there is still room for innovative projects in this area - just look at the process not in the general perspective of the complication of devices, but in the exact opposite. <br><br>  The well-known phrase about all ingenious is simple in the case of the <a href="http://hammerhead.io/">Hammerhead navigator</a> can be supplemented with other epithets.  For example, convenient and more secure.  Yes, of course, business does not do without a classic interface here either.  But here it remains on the screen of your smartphone, which is in your pocket. <br><br>  And the direction of movement is indicated by dynamic LEDs embedded in a steering wheel-mounted pointer, shaped like a hammer - hence the name Hammerhead.  The device is synchronized via Bluetooth with the application, and now the commands to turn or turn around are visualized by the clear movement of the LED lights. <br><br>  The gadget is not afraid of rain or other precipitations, it works on one charge up to 10 hours, it is simply mounted on the steering wheel and in addition is equipped with daylight lights, like all vehicles on the road. <br><br>  Hammerhead is already <a href="http://hammerhead.io/">available for pre-order</a> for $ 85. <br><br>  <b>Siva Cycle - Bicycle recharge for your gadgets</b> <br><br>  The idea to turn the energy of rotation of the wheel into electricity for at least 150 years.  And on an industrial scale, it is successfully implemented a long time ago.  But when it comes to the most primitive household sales - there is no movement here.  In any case, it was not.  Before the advent of the universal bicycle recharging <a href="http://sivacycle.com/">Siva Cycle</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35e/95c/8ec/35e95c8ecb484f2ba220708519e66124.png"><br><br>  The mechanism of action of this gadget is known to everyone since school - inside a regular generator, but with high efficiency, assembled from innovative materials.  Which - the developers are kept secret.  But the fact remains: in an ultra-compact case there is a very efficient transducer, moreover, it requires an increase in the efforts of the cyclist by only 3% compared to the usual pressure force on the pedals. <br><br>  The device is mounted on the rear axle, there is enough space, even if you use wings.  The battery is removable, so you can recharge as on the go - USB-connector is mounted under the seat, and in any other place: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94d/bbc/35f/94dbbc35f6604ff1849549917c71a81f.png"><br><br>  The gadget is not afraid of water, and is suitable for use in all conditions.  The battery is designed for 3-4 years of operation and can withstand up to 400 charging cycles.  You can already buy it for <a href="http://sivacycle.com/">$ 130</a> with shipping in March. <br><br>  <b>Revoligths - Revolutionary Bicycle Wheel Lights</b> <br><br>  Safety on the road - a question for any cyclist relevant.  And to a much greater extent than for any other participants in the movement.  And especially in the dark.  The lights on the steering wheel and brake lights at the back, of course, the issue with visibility on the road decide.  But not the way the <a href="http://revolights.com/">Revoligths</a> wheel light <a href="http://revolights.com/">does</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efe/f9b/dcc/efef9bdcc2224d95894a52cab4873dbc.png"><br><br>  This effect of burning arches - white on the front wheels and red on the rear - is achieved using a patented design consisting of four rims with built-in LED lamps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/014/77a/a56/01477aa566664bbc9d03cadde625c560.png"><br><br>  A small power unit is mounted on the sleeve: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fb/4e2/492/2fb4e249271f46b3926da57250b9556c.png"><br><br>  It provides the operation of LED-lamps for four hours, is recharged through a standard USB-connector. <br>  You can buy the kit now <a href="http://revolights.com/pages/store">in the store</a> on the official website, there are also all sorts of accessories for bikes, functional and not very much. <br><br>  <b>Vector - a new tracker from Garmin</b> <br><br>  Cycling is not easy.  And those who deal with them professionally, and those who deal with them for themselves, know that the correct distribution of forces, the maximum efforts where it is needed, and the rational alternation of load are essential conditions for high results.  But do it on a whim, based on your own feelings and physical condition?  Previously, and trained.  But not now, when there is an effective tracker to track the many functions associated with the work of the feet of a cyclist - <a href="http://sites.garmin.com/en-US/vector/">Vector</a> from Garmin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f34/231/bde/f34231bde50d45bea0210f916e54c49c.png"><br><br>  The touch module is attached to both pedals of your bike - suitable for almost all models.  The installation itself does not cause issues, demos can be viewed on the <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/prod93569.html">site</a> . <br><br>  So, what does the tracker measure?  And, in general, all: <br><ul><li>  force of pressure on the pedals </li><li>  the balance of effort between the pedals </li><li>  applied efforts in different time intervals, </li><li>  total energy expended in watts, </li><li>  total energy expended in kJ, </li><li>  the smoothness of the pedals, </li><li>  load density </li><li>  and plus some special options. </li><li> Naturally, all data is synchronized in real time to Garmin's onboard gadgets, and it is possible to analyze the results of training directly in its process, changing the load and intensity. </li></ul><br><br>  You can buy the tracker now at a price of <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/prod93569.html">$ 1500</a> , deliveries will begin in 5-8 weeks. <br><br>  <b>Skylock - all bike locks lock</b> <br><br>  A good bike is expensive.  And take it from you to drive - for a while or as it will - there are a lot of people willing.  So in this regard, the actual topic of protecting your own investments finds its next continuation.  In general, a lock for a bike is necessary if you have to park it somewhere unattended due to the nature of the trips. <br>  But, as it turns out, the castle is different, and such as Skylock, we still have not seen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d34/42e/7b5/d3442e7b59524bf383581c29b72f4224.png"><br><br>  Still would: <br><ol><li>  high-grade steel </li><li>  the absence of a mechanical key - opens either from a smartphone, or by successive pressing of keys from the end, </li><li>  solar cell for recharging - 12 hours of travel during the daytime will provide a charge for 6 months of work, </li><li>  built-in antenna and Bluetooth module - the ability to inform about hacking attempts or traffic incidents, </li><li>  possibility of recharging via USB-connector. </li></ol><br><br>  In general, a miracle of technology, not a castle.  And already available - now Skylock can be ordered at a discount of 35% for <a href="http://skylock.cc/">$ 159</a> . <br><br>  And finally, we remind you that you can bring any devices for your bike and the best trips to Russia with the help of LiteMF, quickly and at the lowest prices in Russia. <br><br> <a href="http://litemf.com/ru/price"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/d7d/506/521d7d506c53477494e0b40d66252dba.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377085/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377085/</a></p>
