This event attracts hundreds of developers and partners who work with the company's products.  This year, more than 800 people gathered.  Many who were with their relatives, whom I think there was also something to do, because there are many different amusement parks in the district, in one of which we were all together. <br><br>  Under the cut a small photo essay. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br clear="all">  At the summit there were sessions in the mode of presentations, and sessions of the academy, for which preliminary registration was required due to the limited number of places for them.  At the academies conducted an in-depth study of the topics with practical training. <br><br>  The event was held at the Hilton Bonnet Creek Orlando.  Large roomy hotel with a large conference area, where there were many rooms from large to small rooms where you could hold small presentations.  Swimming pool where you can sunbathe and swim.  Nearby there is a golf course where a competition with the participation of those who came to the summit took place on the first day  There was also a football competition. <br> <a href="http://www.hiltonbonnetcreek.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b6/62a/1e8/7b662a1e87588320934be2d2b44e74e8.jpg"></a> <br>  On the first evening, everyone who came was entertained with live music in nature.  On the second day, the weather turned bad, there was a heavy downpour, and the party was already in the room where we had breakfast and lunch. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cc/7c7/44a/5cc7c744ae955a6fef61f8dd038feede.jpg"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a41/9a0/a16/a419a0a16b99767c433adcb58ce1825c.jpg"></a>

      The main part of the summit began with Keynote Presentation, a live broadcast was made from this presentation, and everyone could watch it online.  It all started with a brief speech by Terry Reygon, President and Founder of the Company. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34d/99f/2bc/34d99f2bcfd7e4715f06cb0bb23c05d4.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fb/43f/832/7fb43f832e5277e2422a60e87045746c.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df6/8fa/a15/df68faa15fd787b486eba04507d91c73.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Recording of Paul Grabshide. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVl6-L0K1Xw&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjhezzc5c5bZ5Sewaep6yolj1XPhQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For developers, the Developer Zone was organized, where you could sit at the tables to talk, discuss InterSystems technologies together with leading developers of the company.  It was possible to connect your laptop, recharge your phone if necessary.  Throughout the territory allocated for the summit was available internet via Wi-Fi. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8b/0af/e33/a8b0afe33732540d72cec36ade6e9171.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24f/1e9/684/24f1e9684ec225ef302da2c71068b2a6.jpg"></a> <br><br>  There were also shared computers with Internet access. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26c/d7c/1ae/26cd7c1ae3f2c1548b98b2d1b202b81d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Approximately the halls for holding academic sessions looked like, they were equipped with laptops, practical materials were given out at the entrance.  Laptops were with Internet access and at all was launched a virtual machine with everything you need to carry out practical exercises. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8d/49b/c15/f8d49bc15537d915c789aa14830ec548.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The main corridor in which, on the tables, later housed the company partners who this year represented their companies and their projects. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/67d/3e2/a66/67d3e2a66f398c34eb6f414cca2f414a.jpg"></a> <br><br>  This year we were entertained at Universal Park.  The park was available only to summit participants.  4 rides were available: roller coaster;  and attractions on the principle of 4D cinema: minions, transformers and Shrek.  A variety of exotic food and drinks was available to everyone on the street. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1bf/e92/d57/1bfe92d5775d9ad4928430533e15a718.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb8/682/bc8/cb8682bc8791cb023fd2101e64868e1c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  This was my first trip to the summit, and I do not regret it at all, everything was very wonderful, excellent organization of both the summit and the sessions, presentations, academic sessions, excellent entertainment.  Unfortunately, there was practically no one from our Russian-speaking community, and it is a pity.  I hope more than once to go to this event in the future and wish the others to get there too. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sc/bkm1f0ypgwp4a1h/NkYsGFvehf">All photos from the summit</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sc/pobr54ta2v740se/V4yighwtex">All photos from Universal Park</a> <br><br>  UPD: <br>  <a href="http://www.intersystems.com/who-we-are/events/intersystems-global-summit-2014/developer-conference-presentations/">Download presentations from the summit</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217297/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217297/</a></p>
