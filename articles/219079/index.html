The change of context allows you to tune in to the working mood and enter the ‚Äústream‚Äù faster.  Cafes were previously chosen as a place of activity, summer houses in parks, and now the undoubted trend is AntiCafe and other coworking.  The latter implies an hourly or monthly payment. <br>  It turns out that <a href="http://sanchopancho.ru/sashka-borodach-ili-idealnaya-rabota-dlya-lenivogo-vebmastera.html">some freelancers</a> approach the issue of choosing a place <s>abnormally</s> creative - they are arranged in good offices by security guards with minimal duties. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you approach the issue from a practical point of view, the benefits on the face: <br><ul><li>  they pay you, not you (as well as experience, retirement, everything :); </li><li>  discipline and regime (chief assistants in the fight against procrastination); </li><li>  all infrastructure is available free of charge (you do not need to pay for tea / coffee, unlike a cafe); </li><li>  the need for regular inspections of the territory allows you to keep yourself in physical shape and take care of your eyesight; </li><li>  the human environment eliminates the signs of asociality; </li><li>  if you work as a security guard in a business suit, you can meet with your customers directly in the negotiation office; </li><li>  after a few months of such ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù, it is possible to move to the next level in the form of obtaining a license for weapons and related new sensations; </li></ul><br>  There are also disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  the presence of the head and at least small, but official duties; </li><li>  may have to wear uniforms (although it may seem like a plus to someone) </li></ul><br>  I propose to improve the solution.  Namely, instead of finding a job, open your own store. <br>  In order for the cost of renting a shop to be comparable to the cost of coworking, it must be a small (4-10m <sup>2</sup> ) shopping island in a mid-market shopping center.  Prices on the 2nd and subsequent floors may differ significantly from the first. <br>  It is better to start together with the same enthusiast of urban downshifting, so that the store can be opened 7 days a week.  The term ‚Äúpair programming‚Äù in this case acquires a new meaning :) <br><br>  Opening a shopping island in a shopping center, we get: <br><ul><li>  workplace at coworking rate, </li><li>  walking distance of cafes and food courts (no need to cook), and possibly a fitness room, </li><li>  opportunity to come to the meeting with the customer on time, because  meetings will be scheduled in a cafe on the floor below or above, </li><li>  freedom of schedule compared to the post of guard, </li><li>  as a bonus, revenue from the sale of goods. </li></ul><br>  The opening of the trading island does not require large initial investments. <br>  Some practical advice. <br>  Equipment to buy on Avito from moving entrepreneurs. <br>  It is better to sell something that is not very massive and not cheap, so that we are not very distracted by buyers during the day.  Ideal for a programmer and webmaster: gadgets, radio-controlled toys, board or card games, etc. <br>  When concluding a lease agreement, be sure to pay attention to the obligatory observance of the work schedule of the shopping center. <br>  If you comply with the schedule of shopping centers, it is obligatory, and even more so if a penalty is set for its violation, such a shopping center does not suit us. <br>  Pay attention to how far from the intended installation site are located the dynamics of the warning system of the shopping center.  Continuous broadcasting can interfere with concentration. <br><br>  Ready to answer your questions.
