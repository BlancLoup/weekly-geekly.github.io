  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RadioNet - undernote, but free</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  RadioNet, in short, is a system that allows anyone to just walk around the local radio network for free.  But first things first. <br><br>  About a year ago, bored and listening to the radio from the phone, I could not take my eyes off the RDS text strip.  ‚ÄúWhy the idea is not developed further?‚Äù <a name="habracut"></a>  - Spun in my head, because the radio can be used to transmit much more information than the name of the song.  Then I remembered a long-forgotten (or rarely remembered?) Tv chip - teletext.  Here it is.  It was close to what I imagined at that moment about the possibility of data transmission by radio waves.  So, the idea arose: is it possible to make a receiver (and, accordingly, a transmitter), which would receive and display information in the form of at least text pages? <br><br>  Behind my shoulders only economic education, therefore, for the solution of the question I had to turn to people who were smarter and more knowledgeable about the question.  A programmer and a couple of telecommunication experts were found among acquaintances, and after some clarifications and descriptions of the desired result, a quite reasonable answer was received: ‚ÄúHmm ...‚Äù, followed by a wave of discussions, disputes and calling each other nothing by incomprehensible ghouls.  If in the abbreviation, then in this hot and, what to hide, drunk dispute, we came to the conclusion that the idea is not only not devoid of meaning, but also quite simple to implement both in software and in hardware.

      So, it was decided to call all this RadioNet.  In short, this is a system that allows anyone to get in (would be a receiver) and roam free on a local radio network.  He represents a small system of pages on which, presumably, it will be possible to read something: news, weather, announcements ... well, a newspaper.  And it is local because it directly depends on the transmitters and their coverage area.  Thus, if the radio network will operate in several cities, then in each city you will see information tied to this particular city (say, news, bus schedules, etc.).  The pages themselves are most reminiscent of wap-sites - small amounts of text, and miserable pictures of even smaller size.  For a radio network to work, without going into details, very little is needed: a carrier (server) on which all pages of the radio network are stored, a transmitter (s) that compresses, encrypts and transmits data, and a receiver that decodes and displays data. <br><br>  The main problem in the design of the system was the inability of the receiver to interact with the transmitter and, as a consequence, the creation of hyperlinks to other pages.  If the client constantly communicates with the server on the Internet, then in the case of the radio we cannot indicate which page we should send at the moment.  And the solution turned out to be very simple: the hyperlink is a command to the receiver to switch to a new frequency, on which the necessary page is located.  In addition, several pages can be stored on the same frequency, and an additional label in the hyperlink indicates which particular page is needed. <br><br>  In general, this is all the basic functionality.  The main advantage of the radio receiver is that it can be carried with you as a telephone or newspaper, but its use is absolutely free, unlike the mobile Internet or regular purchases of a new newspaper.  To be honest, a simple radio is also free, but the specific information on the radio can only be learned at a certain time, which is not always convenient. <br><br>  And now the main thing: what do we have today?  And we have what became the reason for writing the article - the germ of the current prototype, which proves that the system can work.  The prototype was assembled on the basis of ... Khm ... spare parts from the Chinese (yes) counterfeit (yes-yes) Ipod (yes-yes-yes).  The prototype, in fact, is not able to do so much - so far it can display only one page, support for hyperlinks has not yet been implemented.  But the fact that it has turned out at least something personally makes us happy and proud of ourselves.  Finally, here it is in the work: <br><br><img src="http://www.3gp.ag/b89/47392557.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, the cost price of the device‚Äôs parts is only about 300 rubles, including the use of a gigabyte of memory unnecessary for us, a voice recorder and a case from supposedly iPod (it‚Äôs also in retail). <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know what impression you have of my description, but in fact a thing can be quite useful if the radio network is distributed everywhere, and especially if the receiver is not in the form of a separate device, but embedded in phones / players.  For example, being on vacation in a strange city, you can easily, even without knowing the addresses of sites, find information about places of interest, transport schedules, places where you can relax.  Speaking of the latter, advertising of such places should be the main (one of) source of income in the future. <br><br>  In addition, the other day the idea was proposed to include in the device local positioning system based on radio direction finding, because if the city will be a whole pile of transmitters ... and in general, until we manage without fantasies. <br><br>  Tune in to our wave, we will keep you updated! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111009/</a></p>
