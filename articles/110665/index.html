Usually at this time people begin to strongly believe in miracles, God, the renewal of themselves and their lives.  And I thought: why, then, these people (who in 8 cases out of 10 will spend the January holidays in front of the monitor) don‚Äôt tell about such a spiritual and intellectual site like <a href="http://pritchi.ru/">Pritchi.ru</a> ? <br>  The author and owner of the site name is Andrey Viktorovich Yakushev, he is 42 years old, he lives in Rostov-on-Don.  Given the specific focus of Habr, I decided to just interview A.V.  like the chief technician on the subject. <br>  Hope it brings you some interesting minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2f0df654/d0852252/a158eeff/3a6d9bbe.png">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  0. <i>Tell us about Andrei Yakushev - who is this person?</i> <br><br>  It is very difficult to write about yourself, especially when asked a general question, to which you can answer anything.  I, like any other person, have many sides, qualities and hypostases.  But here, I think, it makes sense to say about those of my parties, which at least relate to the site of Pritchi.ru. <br>  So, as a programmer, I was born in 1988 when I started writing programs ‚Äî first in BASIC, then in Pascal, then in Assembler.  Since about 2002 I have been programming for the web. <br>  In 1992 I could be called a poet.  Although the first poems appeared in 1983, but then they looked like ‚Äúugly ducks‚Äù. <br>  In 1996, I became a journalist working in the Rostov newspaper ‚ÄúLight Breath‚Äù. <br>  My birth as a philosopher could be observed in 2000, when I took up the Bible study closely. <br>  Around the same year, I was born as a writer.  Then I began to write small stories, mostly pure fiction, less often - based on what I was watching.  Despite the fact that I started writing stories for a long time, my print publications were not related to my previous work.  At about the same time (2005‚Äì2006) collections of parables began to appear, where I am the author, and the book <br>  ‚ÄúWe are starting to work on the Internet.  Quick Start Guide, written by me personally. <br>  In 2008, I tried to open my own charitable foundation.  Rostov newspapers wrote about these attempts, but, unfortunately, my efforts were broken on the rocks of stereotypes and administrative obstacles.  But from charity, I still did not leave.  Since May 2009, the website Pritchi.ru has been transferring money monthly to the Charity Fund ‚ÄúChildren's Houses‚Äù. <br>  In April 2009, I participated as an expert in the television program ‚ÄúThe Night Channel‚Äù on the ‚ÄúCapital‚Äù TV channel dedicated to ‚Äúthe books we read‚Äù. <br>  That's probably all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/46c7cabe/faceb81b/652a80bf/3f35df3e.jpg"><br><br>  1. <i>How did you get the idea to create a website for parables?</i>  <i>How did it all start?</i> <br><br>  If you start from afar, then I became fascinated with parables a long time ago, in the year of 90th: a person whom I can in a sense call my Master often used them to illustrate my own views on life. <br>  When in 2000 I got access to the Internet (from work, about home then there was no particular thought), I came across the ‚ÄúAll Different Parables‚Äù newsletter, which was then led by a girl named Tanya Krol.  I decided to collect these parables.  I found the newsletter to be a rich source, but I wanted to have these parables on hand and use them in my life.  Since I am a programmer, I decided to make an electronic collection of materials from this newsletter.  By that time, she had only been out for a few months, and after sitting for half a week, I drove all the parables that had appeared in her into the hlp format book, and then wrote a letter to Tanya Krol with a proposal to advertise my book in my newsletter: .  She agreed.  She said: ‚ÄúHow many people said they were ready to help, and when I agreed, they disappeared.  And you did it first, and then said. " <br>  After a few months the newsletter stopped coming out.  Tanya is gone.  I wrote letters to her, but she did not answer.  I myself began to receive letters from readers with questions about whether there would be a sequel (I was perceived as a co-author).  I said that I do not have access to the mailing list.  Then they began to ask me to update at least a collection.  And I began to look for materials myself and upload new versions of the collection. <br>  I tried to find Tanya for a year, but I could not.  People wrote letters and asked to continue the mailing.  Then I wrote to the administrators Subsribe.ru, so that they passed the newsletter to me.  They tried to contact Tanya by the details that were specified in her author's profile, but they also failed.  And then they gave me the newsletter.  That was in May 2003.  Since then, I have been releasing the newsletter. <br>  After some time, I began to receive letters asking to organize a discussion of parables.  But in order to discuss parables, they must be posted on the Internet in free access.  The mailing list archive did not fit, because the parables during the mailing downtime became more than its releases.  Then I opened the section ‚ÄúProverbs‚Äù on my website avy.ru.  For a while, not for long at all, a community for discussing parables was working on Rostov.ru.  But then the portal was reformed, and the discussion was closed there.  I made a forum on my site so that you can discuss parables directly on the site. <br>  In 2006, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãseparating parables from my personal site matured.  In December of the same year, the website Pritchi.ru was opened in the form in which it is now.  The site is constantly being upgraded.  Since 2007, I have assistants who process and post texts on the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/42baa58c/e02cb51b/f3eb88a6/dfb9ca59.png"><br><br>  In the summer of 2009, an application was submitted for registration of the Pritchi.ru trademark, <br>  in November 2010, a positive decision was received.  Now Pritchi.ru is a registered trademark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1245500c/53531eb3/3a170198/433864d4.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, the original one, the collection still exists, grows and replenishes.  Only he has undergone a change: from the hlp format, he turned into chm.  This was due to the fact that the latter is supported by a large number of platforms, in particular (which is valuable) mobile devices.  So those people who want to constantly have on hand all the parables, located on the site, can purchase this <a href="http://sbornik.pritchi.ru/">collection</a> and, figuratively speaking, always carry it in your pocket. <br><br>  2. <i>If you enter the word ‚Äúparables‚Äù into a search engine, almost 5 million links appear, but yours is the first.</i>  <i>How does Proverbs.ru differ from other sites with parables?</i> <br>  The peculiarity of the site, unlike many other collections of parables on the Internet, is that the parables on the site are not laid out by visitors, but by a team of administrators.  We and only we are responsible for the quality of the material located on the site.  First of all, it must be the parables.  Although the definition of a parable is quite broad, but now a certain trend is emerging and, I think, the word ‚Äúparable‚Äù acquires clearer boundaries.  In addition, the text is being processed, which includes the definition of the section for its storage, correction (spelling and punctuation corrections), the definition of the parable's meaning and the selection of keywords for it that make up the index on the site.  If you look more generally, you can add that we are probably the only such site that has offices on Twitter, LiveJournal, various social networks.  This is not just a place where you can read and discuss what you read, but probably something more. <br><br>  3. <i>How was the site created in a technical sense?</i>  <i>What difficulties did you encounter, were there any non-standard moves?</i> <br><br>  One of the main reasons for creating the site was the need to discuss the parables directly next to the parable itself (on my website the parables were in the same section, and their discussion took place on the forum).  Therefore, initially I had a choice: either to adapt the forum engine and lay out parables in the form of forum topics, or do everything with my own hands, and write some discussion mechanism myself and everything connected with it.  I chose the latter because, in addition to the discussion, other ideas began to emerge that are still easier to implement yourself, initially just as you imagine. <br>  I have long dreamed of making a forum in a hierarchical form (I somehow saw one like this at the ‚ÄúOrthodox Conversation‚Äù - I liked it).  In this forum, you can do without quoting, because  it is immediately clear which message is being answered, and the quotes do not give a coherent reading of the discussion.  I understand that these are controversial statements, there are still not so many hierarchical forums, but this was a personal wish, and it justified itself in a sense. <br>  The next idea, which I really wanted to implement, and which was supposed to be the ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù of the site, is an analysis of visitors 'preferences based on parables' estimates and making individual predictions: the site offers parables to visitors that they haven‚Äôt read (appreciated), choosing exactly those which are more likely to appeal to each specific visitor.  The idea is not mine, she again spied.  There was once a site iqrate.com, which arranged the same with movies: it was necessary to evaluate several films that you watched;  and based on these estimates, a forecast was created.  The ratings of other visitors were checked, matches were searched for the estimated positions and unvalued positions were selected with the maximum rating.  So it is with us. <br>  Now the website Pritchi.ru makes not only online ‚Äúpredictions‚Äù, but also offline: tens of thousands of subscribers of the newsletter 3 times a week receive a new parable and evaluate it.  As it turned out, many of them do not have access to the Internet.  Those.  E-mail for them - the only window into the world wide web.  And I gave them the opportunity not only to vote via email, but also <br>  to order a preamble that is interesting to this reader to your mailbox.  Now the site makes about 1.3 million sentences (each reader is offered 30 of the most interesting parables; therefore, the site makes an offer of about 45.5 thousand people).  Approximately every 30 minutes, a program is launched on the site that looks for who needs to update the offer (or <br>  a person has already appreciated something from the offer, or has appreciated something else, and it is necessary to correct the list available for him). <br>  The main difficulty in the operation of the site was that the site is now located on a shared hosting.  And when the load began to increase, I had to think about how to solve issues with the hosting support service, which made claims about exceeding the load limits on the CPU and database server.  One step was - upgrade of the tariff plan, the transition to more expensive conditions, where these restrictions are not <br>  hard.  But it did not save.  The fact is that many people just wanted to download the entire site, this, of course, created a very large load.  I had to roll up my sleeves again and start programming.  I wrote a script that does not allow it.  If the user too often accesses the site, then he is issued a warning asking "do not rush to press F5".  If this warning does not lead to the desired result, then the ip-address of the user is blocked by htaccess for 2 months ( <a href="http://avy.ru/ftopic1870.html">link to the script</a> for the curious). <br><br>  But the problem was not completely solved.  Search Engines are also not asleep.  And they didn‚Äôt want to ban them at all.  Then I decided to write another utility - caching sql queries.  This thing is not unique, many engines use it.  I decided to do it in my own way, the way I imagine it and the way I need it in my work ( <a href="http://avy.ru/ftopic1869.html">link</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8d2bcb7a/0ff5927f/9cb62e99/c7050dd7.png"><br><br>  4. <i>What is the audience of the site?</i>  <i>What is Pritch.ru relationship with his reader?</i>  <i>Apparently, your website is trying to focus on the person as much as possible - is your activity outside the world wide web?</i> <br><br>  The audience of the site is 62% male.  These are those who registered as regular visitors.  But subscribers subscribers on 58% of the woman.  These are mainly people from 18 to 40 years old (most of all 26-30), but there are also those who are over 55 (about 6%).  Geography - the whole world, including Africa, Australia and South America.  Surprisingly, the site comes from Japan, New Guinea, Korea, New Zealand, South Africa and Ireland. <br>  Most of the visits from non-CIS countries are to the USA, Germany and Israel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4b53c8f1/82bd3a5f/12d9c918/60bcd53c.png"><br><br>  People interested in parables are not quite the average Internet user.  These are people who think, feel, value the accuracy of the word, and the purity of the language.  They can be called the elite, the intelligentsia of the Network. <br>  After Pritchi.ru gained its current form (with the possibility of discussing parables), the relationship with readers became a relationship.  There are more authors who want to post their parables on the site.  And posting them, they also enter into discussions with other readers, discussing their work.  In addition, I am very grateful to the readers and site visitors for writing letters with suggestions for improving it. <br>  Thanks to the site, my activity related to parables in 2004 came out, so to speak, into reality: I was offered to publish collected parables in printed collections.  Since 2005, the Rostov-based publishing house Phoenix has released a series of 9 thematic collections, which have already become a bibliographic rarity.  Now 2 more collections are being prepared for publication.  I will tell you a secret - they will be larger than the previous ones. <br><br>  5. <i>Now on Pritscha.ru is a series of updates.</i>  <i>Please tell us what</i> <i><br></i>  <i>are these improvements, and what is the reason for their appearance?</i> <br><br>  The site, since its discovery, was updated constantly.  Initially there was not: an indication of the size of the parable, the movements in the rating, the ability to evaluate comments on parables, send the parable by e-mail and much more.  But lately there have been many ideas for improving the site that I wanted to implement immediately, rather than gradually, and I got down to business.  The first step was <br>  adding audio versions of parables.  Then we succumbed to modern trends, and on December 23 of this year, we bought out the Cyrillic domain of parable.rf, it is redirected to our website.  After the phrase ‚ÄúPritchi.ru‚Äù became a trademark, I had to open some kind of representative offices on various sites where people could contact us, I already mentioned this.  But the main purpose of change is always to increase the interactivity of the site.  I think now sites that do not meet the requirements of WEB 2.0 will be uninteresting to visitors. <br><br>  6. <i>Surely many interesting things happen on your site.</i>  <i>Could you tell about something remembered?</i> <br><br>  Indeed, there was everything: pleasant and not very funny. <br>  Pleasant - this is grateful letters from readers.  Often they write about how parables miraculously help in current affairs.  One woman said that her friend had died, and for several days she did not go herself.  And then suddenly a parable from Walsh came to the newsletter, and she somehow brought the woman back to normal, reassured her.  A woman wrote about it.  It was nice, and even nicer to know what it is - not uncommon. <br>  Of unpleasant events, mistakes are recalled.  For example, there was a case when I once had to apologize to readers for the fact that I published a ‚Äúfalse‚Äù parable.  Placed the parable from Oscar Wilde "The Nightingale and the Rose", took this text from somewhere on the Internet, from some forum and did not check the original.  And then it turned out that someone rewrote this end in his own way, in the way he wanted, and did not say anything about it.  And on my site for 2 years, Wilde's parable hung with someone's alteration, until someone who was familiar with the original text made a remark to me. <br>  It seemed funny to me when the visitor registered on the site and began to criticize everyone: the authors of parables, and other visitors who left their comments.  In the end, he began using unacceptable expressions in his criticism, after which he was banned. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and patience!  I hope the post has brought you pleasure and / or benefit. <br>  Have a nice holidays! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110665/</a></p>
