      To solve this headache, a useful startup <a href="http://2ns.info/">2ns.info</a> was created, which is a kind of domain control panel that allows you to concentrate all the necessary services in one place: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/122294/">Notepad domains</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/122294/">DNS management</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/122294/">Domain Parking</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/122294/">Redirects</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/122294/">Domain Statistics</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/122294/">Whois</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/122294/">IP Whois</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/122294/">View DNS domain records</a> </li></ul>  - and additional, but useful chips: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/122294/">Mass check of TIC sites</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/122294/">Punycode converter</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/122294/">Password generator</a> </li></ul><br>  The project is really very interesting, its detailed review is under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Introduction to the service </h4><br>  Theater begins with a hanger, and the site - with registration.  If registration cannot be avoided on the resource, then at least it will be as simple as possible! <br><br>  <a href="http://2ns.info/index.php">Three steps</a> were taken at 2ns.info to perfect registration: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fc677b85/62ccd752/56b6cc7c/08b611e4.png"><br><ol><li>  firstly, the process of creating a name is simplified - by default, the mailing address is up to [at], </li><li>  secondly, a rare and more valuable convenience ‚Äî there is no need to repeat the password (tell me honestly, how many of you enter it honestly with your hands, and not copy and paste, thereby nullifying the whole point of the idea with protection against typos?), </li><li>  and thirdly - the process of creating a password is simplified for lovers of security passwords: click on the lock in the input field - and the system will generate a pass for you. </li></ol><br>  And so that a random or password entered by you with a typo does not become a problem for you later, it will immediately drop to your email - do you need to say that the service also does not require any dull ‚Äúregistration confirmations‚Äù, you will automatically be logged in under the newly created user right after the fill forms. <br><br>  In this case, everything is safe: the <b>password is not stored in clear text.</b>  When registering, it is simply inserted into the body of the letter and encrypted into the database. <br><br>  A well-thought-out and convenient registration system is a pleasant feature, though not directly related to the specialization of the project, but indicating, if you will, the depth of its development. <br><br>  Now let's go over what this service can do, in more detail. <br><br><h4>  Domains </h4><br>  Section "Domains" - the main site.  It includes: domain notepad, DNS management, domain parking, redirects and statistics. <br><br><a name="1"></a>  <b><a href="http://2ns.info/domains.php%3Fmode%3Dnote">Notepad domains</a></b> <br>  With it, you will never forget to renew your domains or put a busy domain in tracking, and register it as soon as it becomes free. <br><br>  The system itself is able to update the data on the expiration date of the domain registration, therefore, it is not necessary to follow the relevance of information either.  Also automatically updated TIC, DNS server and recorder. <br><br>  For these and other parameters, you can quickly search domains in notepad.  At the moment, you can see expiring domains only on the site, but in the very near future it will be possible to customize the distribution of such domains to e-mail, using sms or jabber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7c8a4b38/822a3141/06c4a0c6/2f0e935f.png"><br><br>  Notepad itself is a list of domains with the ability to sort and search by them: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b0d0b10b/a5ec5f34/6d7defa5/119aef6f.png"><br><br>  Each domain can see and change quite a few fields: a label (similar to folders, for quick search), tags, a link to the panel to manage the domain (so that you can quickly extend the domain), as well as add comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ef9afe6e/05e115c5/971ba490/9cb7107a.png"><br><br>  Entering each domain separately is not required - they can be entered in a list, and the system will convert them into a table with data on them.  It is also not necessary to enter the data manually - by pressing one button, the site itself whos of each domain will parse itself and fill in all the fields: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/66da3152/c5127de1/8fbbea1a/d597a6bc.png"><br><br><a name="2"></a>  <b><a href="http://2ns.info/domains.php%3Fmode%3Ddns">DNS management</a></b> <br>  A word to the author of the service Leonid Sizov: <br><blockquote>  I do not know how for you, but for me the management of DNS records for domains is a headache.  Until the writing of the service, I did not see any truly excellent service for managing domain records.  There were good solutions (for example, at the ISPManager panel), but all these services had quite serious drawbacks. </blockquote><br>  On <a href="http://2ns.info/">2ns.info,</a> editing records for any domain looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d056e420/9414c30b/afea069e/5c258f14.png"><br><br><blockquote>  The solution is fully implemented on AJAX, allows you to add an unlimited number of records of various types.  There is also a quick domain setup to work with mail from Google or Yandex. <br><br>  Just like the domain notepad - there is a search by various parameters, the ability to add domains as a list. <br><br>  Regarding the DNS servers: I decided not to waste money and put 4 DNS servers.  In reality, there are three now, but when the number of domains on the service increases, the fourth one will be connected. </blockquote><br><br><a name="3"></a>  <b><a href="http://2ns.info/domains.php%3Fmode%3Dparking">Domain Parking</a></b> <br>  The service aims to sell domains and count the number of visitors.  There are two options for the displayed page: either a blank sheet (serves only to calculate statistics), or a feedback form with a message about the sale of a domain.  There is no extraneous advertising on the "parked" domains, and, most likely, it will not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/626d0e31/18dbb676/a2592865/9e8c50b8.png"><br>  <i><a href="http://parking.2ns.info/">An example of using parking</a> .</i> <br><br>  Statistics can be viewed by month.  When the user first logs in, the cookie is set for a year, and in the future he will no longer be counted in the statistics.  Unfortunately, this method does not work with search bots, therefore, in addition to the usual statistics, you can always see the statistics on unique IP addresses. <br><br>  Any parked domain has the ability to manage DNS records, so you can set up mail for this domain or use subdomains for some other purpose. <br><br>  In the future, it will be possible to enter such domains in the portfolio so that you can view the entire list of domains of one user.  Suddenly he has some delicious domain that he wants to sell, and you want to buy. <br><br><a name="4"></a>  <b><a href="http://2ns.info/domains.php%3Fmode%3Dredirect">Redirects</a></b> <br>  This service is also not something outstanding, it can only redirect the visitor from any address on your domain to the desired link and show the statistics of these transitions.  You can also select the type of redirect (301, 302, 303).  As in the parking lot, you can watch statistics on redirects and manage DNS records of domains. <br><br><a name="5"></a>  <b>Statistics</b> <br>  It contains a number of useful and simply entertaining facts - for example, distribution by domain zones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f6b534be/005a5c53/001d25f6/cebfbf56.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/63aabbfa/f70aa7cd/1fd6df0f/26796301.png"><br><br><a name="6"></a><h4>  Whois by domains </h4><br>  The first in the menu of the site is the most, perhaps, the most popular and demanded service - viewing <a href="http://2ns.info/index.php%3Fmode%3Dwhois">whois information about domains</a> : <br><br> <a href="http://2ns.info/index.php%3Fmode%3Dwhois"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/616dc89a/f8124fd7/676b7598/0650923f.png"></a> <br><br>  The service is necessary as part of a service with the concept of ‚Äúall in one‚Äù, but at the same time it has a number of quite unique advantages: support for all zones of level 1 (which have a working whois server) and a huge number of zones of the second level.  The full list of supported zones is <a href="http://2ns.info/index.php%3Fmode%3Dsupported_zones">over 250 already</a> . <br><br>  Also, the site is able to recognize the date of registration, the end date of registration, the registrar and is able to determine the TIC.  In principle, the set of functions is not so solid, however, the use of AJAX and other various buns made this part of the service quite good. <br><br>  The service can check domains with a list, perform checks in several zones and perform other checks.  There is also a query history with a fairly convenient search, so you can always find the results of past checks. <br><br>  Query logs are used only to display them to the user who made the request and to search for errors in the service.  The project is not engaged in interception of domains and other bad deeds :) <br><br><h4>  Instruments </h4><br><br>  This section contains the following services: <br><br><a name="7"></a>  <b><a href="http://2ns.info/tools.php%3Fmode%3Dwhois_ip">Whois IP</a> (IPv4 and IPv6 supported):</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5bf938ea/f8bac70c/59eb11c4/c6a0a23f.png"><br><br><a name="8"></a>  <b><a href="http://2ns.info/tools.php%3Fmode%3Ddns_records">View DNS domain records:</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/38ff91c4/7c7862c5/91f97ab0/84f54196.png"><br><br><a name="9"></a>  <b><a href="http://2ns.info/tools.php%3Fmode%3Dcy">Mass verification of TIC sites:</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c710b926/dc5d897e/01246f96/88c3de62.png"><br><br><a name="10"></a>  <b><a href="http://2ns.info/tools.php%3Fmode%3Dpunycode_converter">Punycode Converter:</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8e72a7ca/9433d29a/b2c87f04/60c39b1e.png"><br><br><a name="11"></a>  <b><a href="http://2ns.info/tools.php%3Fmode%3Dpassword_generator">Password generator:</a></b> <b><br></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b74496ec/94c1b952/5374f435/2afcee60.png"><br><br>  A fairly standard set, but everything is done fairly well and works on ajax, so using these tools is quite convenient.  Passwords are generated in javascript, so it is not possible to intercept them. <br><br><h4>  Development platform </h4><br>  The project was based on the phpbb3 forum engine, so user registration, password reminder, login, sessions, and so on are from there.  And, of course, you can use the possibilities of the forum itself - <a href="http://2ns.info/forum.php">communication with users, discussion of ideas, and so on</a> . <br><br>  The client part is made using jQuery + jQueryUI.  AJAX is used almost everywhere.  Bind acts as DNS servers.  Currently, there are three servers located in Germany and the USA.  Secondary DNS are simple VPS, at the first stage their capacity should be enough to serve all existing domains. <br><br>  In order not to reinvent the wheel, the ISPManager panel API is used to manage DNS servers, which eliminated the need to write a zone file handler and other unnecessary things and greatly increased the speed of development. <br><br>  Service design is a deeply reworked standard phpbb style.  In particular, the active use of AJAX makes working with the site much easier and faster. <br><br><h4>  Limitations and disadvantages </h4><br>  <b>Limitations of whois servers</b> <br>  You probably know that root whois servers have their own limitations on the number of requests from a single IP address.  Each zone has different restrictions ‚Äî some normal and some very tight.  For example, in the development process, a domain zone was found, in which the root whois server set a limit of 1 request per minute.  Of course, the most popular zones do not have such severe restrictions, but still they are.  To combat them, accounts were purchased on 10 hosts, the cost of which does not exceed 20 rubles per month, and a special ‚Äúproxy‚Äù script was loaded on each hosting.  As a result, the central server receives whois data through intermediate servers, thus bypassing the limit on the number of requests from a single IP address.  Caching is also used, so the actual whois verification of the same domain will occur no more than once every 3 minutes. <br><br>  By the way, specifically to avoid habraeffektu, at the time of publication of this post, running 20 such proxy servers. <br><br>  <b>Known bugs</b> <br>  At the moment, some known project problems are associated with the whois-service.  For example, he does not know which domain zones may have IDN domains, and which ones do not.  Also, the service does not know the restrictions on the length of the domain name - and, for example, will say with confidence that the domain "a1.info" is not registered.  There are some minor issues with some .com domains.  For example, a whois server at the request of google.com gives out something not very plausible, but this problem should be solved soon. <br><br><h4>  Development direction and monetization </h4><br>  Existing development plans - first of all, bring existing services to perfection + write additional ones (for example, sending reports via e-mail about domains). <br><br>  In any case, the service will retain a okolodomennaya orientation, therefore, among the next innovations, it is planned to introduce domain registration at ‚Äútasty‚Äù prices and other tools so that you can safely manage existing domains and purchase new ones in one place, without searching for ‚Äúwhere is cheaper‚Äù for different to registrars.  The main task of the project is to make work with domains as convenient and simple as possible. <br><br>  The basic part of the project at the same time will remain free, plans for making money are associated with the payment of future additional buns: a free ‚Äúpackage‚Äù will include some number of domains in a notebook, in the management of CSN, in the parking lot and on redirects.  If this number is not enough - you can buy more.  But these are all plans for the future - now the service provides all services for free for any number of domains. <br><br>  The basic part of the project at the same time will remain free, plans for making money are associated with the payment of future additional buns. <br><br><h4>  Instead of epilogue </h4><br>  Today, <a href="http://2ns.info/">2ns.info</a> is a unique project in its own way, which has no competitors yet - at least not with such automation and not with such a volume of functionality.  He has a simple idea and in his development plans is fully focused on her, which is an important component of success. <br><br>  Well and the most important is a useful and necessary service.  So just wish good luck to the project and its developer! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Author of the project on Habr√©: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/leonid239/" class="user_link">leonid239</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122294/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122294/</a></p>
