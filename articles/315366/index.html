  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Replacing the help desk system. 8 universal tips on how to sabotage migration to a new solution</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Due to the specifics, when developing a cloud service for accounting customer requests - <a href="https://okdesk.ru/">Okdesk</a> , we regularly communicate with hundreds of different service companies throughout our vast country.  And, we admit, we get interesting food for thought. </p><br><p>  As a result of this very communication, we gathered in one post the most popular reasons for which companies representing medium and small businesses want to change their customer support system.  However, the most valuable thing in the article is not the reasons for migration, but universal tips and answers that each of you should use if you want to overcome the task of replacing the current solution with the new Help Desk. </p><br><p>  Now, if a pest craves change in your company, you can easily put an innovator in place. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/149/e55/963/149e55963e394eba9c00494f19a9ef87.png" width="300" alt="Pest in the company"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Help Desk replacement.  Some statistics </h2><br><p>  According to our statistics, among companies wishing to start using the <a href="http://okdesk.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_content%3D8reasons">Help Desk solution</a> , approximately <b>30% are looking for a replacement for the current program</b> .  Moreover, in these 30% there are no people who are looking for a replacement for the universal one and have proven their effectiveness in automating all that is possible: ‚ÄúExcel‚Äù and ‚ÄúE-mail‚Äù. </p><br><p>  In the fight against these monsters, we admit honestly, any specialized Help Desk, CRM or other accounting system has absolutely no chance.  Hundreds of lives spent on an unequal and lost battle with Excel and E-mail are clear evidence of this! </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b2/5c5/e4b/2b25c5e4b0fb4ef9b48e3538f911e77b.png" width="500" alt="Help Desk in Excel"></div><br><p>  Well, if without lyrics: what are the main reasons for replacing the Help Desk systems for sufferers?  We tried to group them in the most understandable way: </p><br><ol><li>  "Inherited from the forefathers" </li><li>  ‚ÄúKopechka ruble saves‚Äù </li><li>  "Now we are mature!" </li><li>  ‚ÄúChanges, our hearts demand‚Äù </li><li>  "What the first caught my eye" </li></ol><br><p>  First, let's deal with each group and only after that we will give a clear and precise rebuff to those who want to change something! </p><br><h2>  Reasons for replacing the Help Desk system </h2><br><h3>  "Inherited from the forefathers" </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d69/3c6/393/d693c63933044a9aa335d35e2709ea42.jpg" width="500" alt="Help Desk inherited"></div><br><p>  In many companies, especially IT companies, there is a logic that has been developed by generations, which can be expressed with the following capacious phrase: ‚ÄúWhy pay for what you can do yourself?‚Äù.  The roots of this phenomenon probably go to our distant ancestors.  The fact is that the result of this logic is the presence of the majority of even small companies of the Ticket Tracker class (and a couple of dozen other systems).  As a rule, such samopiski, moreover, revolve on some ancient server. <br></p><br><p>  People leave, technology changes.  And at the broken trough, we find ourselves without documentation of the patented ‚Äúinvention‚Äù, without a developer who programmed the program valiantly, and the company finally realized that from the point of view of business efficiency, it is more correct to engage in core activities. </p><br><h3>  ‚ÄúKopechka ruble saves‚Äù </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d9/54c/5b3/5d954c5b346e422e94ebdaeaa812ec44.jpg" width="500" alt="Dear Help Desk. Replacement"></div><br><br>  This option of justifying the replacement is usually found among companies that in the "fat" years spent a crazy money on the principle of "let it be."  Often, this led to the purchase of monstrous solutions, whose names in the native language will be spoken not only by everyone.

      Another reason for the need to save the acquired by overworking, of course, was the behavior of our overseas friend, who two years ago took and showed the wooden brother how to grow 2 times on his grandmother's pies with milk.  Help Desk system with monthly payment in overseas money or with the need for annual fees for technical support immediately became a little more expensive.  And if during the year 2015 we all hoped that the ruble would ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù lost positions, now, it seems, no one has any illusions. <br><br><h3>  "Now we are mature!" </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7f/c88/bd9/f7fc88bd966c4777865779685226b0cc.jpg" width="500" alt="Mature Help Desk"></div><br><p>  In this group, perhaps, collected the most diverse options for the need to replace a reliable partner in life - a nice and old Help Desk program.  The main reason for finding new sensations here is the growing up of the company and, as a result, its interests, that is, requests for the capabilities and functions of the solution used.  The fact that yesterday seemed to be a highlight, today is already the 101st time absorbed borscht, and the body, undoubtedly, requires parmesan or, in a worse way, Spanish ham. <br></p><br><h3>  ‚ÄúOur hearts demand change‚Äù </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc7/3e2/9d7/dc73e29d731b42a0a3ec07ea6bda06a0.png" width="500" alt="Replace Help Desk"></div><br><p>  We singled out this group separately because of its large number.  The practice of communication shows that a decent number of companies use some old, but not self-written solution.  Often, even the fact that the founders of companies have chosen to quickly solve the problem 18 years ago.  Undoubtedly, in our youth in fashion were VHS tapes, 3.5 inch diskettes and later monochrome mobile phones.  However, like everything else in the world, Help Desk solutions with the Windows 95 interface, with technologies that stopped developing in the last century, are unlikely to solve modern problems. </p><br><p>  No, undoubtedly, the Nokia 3310 is an absolutely wonderful device, and we, with the whole office, would be happy to arrange the Snake II game championship, but perhaps trying to read the current note on Habr√© on this device will be difficult, and even the guys with such a device no longer clever. <br></p><br><h3>  "What the first caught my eye" </h3><br><p>  What is the difference between galoshes and sneakers?  And in those, and in others, you can successfully walk, even run.  And those and others "breathe."  Both representatives can be attributed to the biological family "shoes".  However, we didn‚Äôt meet people going for a walk / work in galoshes for a long time.  Just as they themselves did not dig potatoes in the grandmother's garden in September in rainy weather in sneakers.  But the attitude towards Help Desk solutions is often similar to the principle ‚ÄúAll yogurts are equally useful‚Äù: what difference does it make where to register applications? </p><br><p>  Among the companies with which we communicate, a sufficiently large number of those who do not see the difference between <a href="https://okdesk.ru/blog/helpdesk-functions-p1">customer support systems</a> and chooses on the principle of "first caught my eye" or "outwardly cute."  As a result - an attempt to dig up potatoes with a rake and rather fast sobering up about the need to change overshoes for sneakers or vice versa. </p><br><h2>  8 universal harmful answers! </h2><br><p>  Any sane person understands that all the reasons mentioned above ‚Äúchange the shoes‚Äù do not have the slightest reason.  But in order to protect your company and you personally from the movements associated with the search and implementation of the new Help Desk solution once and for all, we have prepared universal answers against such initiatives!  Use on health! </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d07/c83/f50/d07c83f50f074979ad38d11fa0575b49.jpg" width="500" alt="Free help desk system"></div><br><ol><li>  We can all by ourselves!  We have free resources!  Yes, take me at least.  I am pleased to deal with the "legacy" and transfer our company to the new automation rails! </li><li>  Pay 3000 rub / month.  we are not ready.  In a year it turns out too expensive.  We ourselves will write in a couple of weeks.  Anyway, there is nothing for people to occupy! </li><li>  Why pay at all?  There are a lot of free solutions on the market!  Let's finalize! </li><li> Reinstall?  Yes, the current solution is inconvenient, it slows down, it is expensive, and it would generally fill the face of someone who chose it.  But the new Help Desk?  The same need to test, select, retrain all of our five employees.  Nobody is ready for change here! </li><li>  Now there is no time to do it.  Let's return to the question in 15 years. </li><li>  And what you email / Excel does not suit? </li><li>  Since childhood, I was taught that breaking is not building.  Let's leave it at that. </li><li>  Everything is fine with us.  Customers don't seem to go away.  Employees, it seems, work for 146%.  For any challenges, our company is probably ready! </li></ol><br><h2>  As output </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fe/3b1/cbf/8fe3b1cbf5d94369939f1fc705035950.jpg" width="500" alt="Implement Help Desk"></div><br><p>  <strong>ps</strong> And what do you answer when trying to implement solutions to replace existing ones in your organization? </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315366/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315366/</a></p>
