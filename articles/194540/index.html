Then I discovered Delphi, which allowed me to achieve what I wanted, and then we went. <br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  Now I‚Äôm writing a Ruby-like compiler for embedded devices called Foundry, I‚Äôll be releasing a beta version soon.  It is a language in which it is as convenient to write as in Ruby, and at the same time it is as effective as C. <br><br>  <b>What is the best and worst part of your job?</b> <br><br>  The best part of my job is that I have a huge number of opportunities, for the realization of which I need a head, a laptop and nothing else. <br><br>  I‚Äôm annoying to sit for ten hours in the room, and this is not very good for health - this is something I don‚Äôt like. <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life / career at the moment?</b> <br><br>  The fact that I now have the opportunity to work on my own project from the beginning to the end and independently determine its fate. <br><br>  <b>What is the purpose of your career and professional development?</b> <br><br>  I want to ensure that my compiler can use someone other than me to solve some practical problems.  And if you look globally, I believe that the huge amount of technologies that are currently used are extremely inefficient in terms of the use of people, and I would like to improve this situation. <br><br>  <b>What helps a programmer to grow professionally?</b> <br><br>  Recently, I read quite a few academic articles on compiler development and learn a lot of new things.  For example, for a huge number of techniques that are used in the C language and are unsafe there, that is, they can easily lead to the fall of the program or the appearance of some kind of vulnerabilities in it, safe analogs have long existed. <br><br>  <b>What book would you recommend to read to any programmer?</b> <br><br>  It's a difficult question.  I did not read books that I would call compulsory reading for a programmer.  What is now called programming is an incredibly wide area, from 1C and JavaScript to programming embedded devices, these are completely different things. <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do when you don't write code?</b> <br><br>  In my free time I like to design iron.  Most recently, I researched <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%259B%25D0%2598%25D0%25A1">FPGAs</a> to find out what this technology is and what it allows to do.  Now the cost of the piece of iron is commensurate with the monthly salary, they have become cheap enough to be able to experiment at home. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview and see you in Moscow!</b> <br><br><h5>  The conference </h5><br>  We invite everyone to the RailsClub'Moscow 2013 conference. Traditionally, we will feed, give presents, hold contests and lotteries, play good music :) There will be a lot of interesting and informative. <br><br>  <a href="http://railsclub.timepad.ru/event/76008/%3Futm_refcode%3D95c73ccecc305e313977a72d1c6f02260353ae99">Registration and payment of participation in the conference</a> . <br><br><h5>  Our sponsors </h5><br><h6>  The general sponsor </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e4/bc8/536/8e4bc85362c29e29b879248da2aeb028.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://undev.ru/">Undev.ru</a> is a strong development team for Ruby, Objective C, C ++, C #, JavaScript.
