  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CNN has created a website for private informers.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The phenomenon of amateur content on the Web manifests itself with a new force.  It got to the point that professional television companies are massively turning to citizens with a request to send them plots, photographs and other materials. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, the reception of audio, photographic and video materials from citizens is a normal practice for television companies and there is a long time ago.  In some cases, companies are even willing to pay money for sensational materials.  But earlier such cases were sporadic, and now, due to the spread of video cameras and smartphones, the phenomenon of ‚Äúcitizen journalism‚Äù has acquired such scope that television companies are looking for new methods of cooperation. <br><br>  So far, no TV company has found the most convenient format for presenting amateur content.  Corporations are trying to copy the tools that have best proven themselves on the Internet: blogs, photo and video services, such as YouTube, even voting systems for the best content, as done on Digg. <br><br>  Recall that even during the terrorist attacks in the London Underground in July last year, the BBC broadcaster opened a section on the site, where users published their photos.  Recently, MTV announced the creation of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/lenta/416/">an interactive television channel, Flux</a> , which will be composed of amateur content.  On the Flux website, users will be able to upload their videos, and the interactive chat of users, along with their avatars, will be broadcast live on TV along with the best video content.

      Another attempt of this kind was made by CNN.  She created a special section on her website dedicated to ‚Äúpopular content‚Äù.  This section is called <a href="http://www.cnn.com/exchange/">CNN Exchange</a> .  Here are photos, videos, emails from all over the world.  The materials sent to the site are referred to as " <nobr>I-Reports</nobr> ", that is, "personal reports." <br><br>  At the moment, the most relevant topic of military conflict in Lebanon.  Accordingly, the main place is occupied by reports from there. <br><br>  In the creation of the "personal reporting" section, the CNN News Service leadership was involved.  Tellingly, all materials sent to the site are always reviewed by CNN full-time editors, as well as a regular informational tape.  This was <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx%3Ftype%3DinternetNews%26amp%3Bstoryid%3D2006-07-31T044939Z_01_N30204752_RTRUKOC_0_US-MEDIA-CNN.xml">announced in an interview with Reuters, the</a> senior vice-president of the news department of the American division of the television station. <br><br>  There are blogs on the site, as well as voting for the best reports. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4225/</a></p>
