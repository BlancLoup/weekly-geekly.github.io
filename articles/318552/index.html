We have selected five projects, the results of which we are sharing with you.  Despite the different branches of activity and geography of our clients, the presented cases show one common pattern: the increasing role of innovative products in communication with the consumer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Case 1. Zendesk - implementation of SMS application on a cloud basis </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/154/0b1/59c/1540b159c87143339e8bd6089a308e27.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Zendesk offers cloud-based customer service programs ‚Äî more than 45,000 companies use Zendesk to set up and manage ticketing systems, integrated chat, phone support and analytics in a simple and efficient format.

      <br>
      The SMS application allows companies using Zendesk services to send direct notifications and receive feedback from the client through the platform.  This is an additional communication channel available through the cloud. <br><br><h3>  Decision </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.infobip.com/ru">Infobip</a> offered Zendesk a mobile <a href="http://www.infobip.com/ru">messaging</a> platform linked to more than 300 telecom operators around the world. <br><br>  We created a web application for the Zendesk platform, with which companies can select and purchase mobile numbers and set the order of required actions with these numbers indicated in the text message.  The application generates a ticket statement for an incoming SMS message, allows you to receive applications or requests from customers for support and introduce a communication system into the ticket system for more convenient use. <br><br>  Integration allows you to create SMS alerts through all Zendesk services.  You can check the status of the ticket or provide feedback by sending the indicated numbers in the message, at any time change the ticket through a text message, and also generate automatic SMS notifications about the creation and change of the ticket. <br><br><h3>  Result </h3><br>  As a result of integration with Infobip, Zendesk has created a universal SMS channel for companies that carry out basic communication with consumers via mobile phones and with coverage all over the world. <br><br><h2>  Case 2. Refunite - expanding communication </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c4/400/58b/2c440058b96a4315946a8821c80ac10c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  REFUNITE helps displaced people find their loved ones through an international database that can be accessed online or through a mobile phone.  Mobile service requires special development: this service must be reliable and sustainable, able to work even in the absence of Internet coverage, be economical for REFUNITE, as well as convenient and popular among users in different countries. <br><br>  Task: launch of mobile communications that help refugees reunite with their families. <br><br><h3>  Decision </h3><br>  Integration of SMS and USSD communication channels. <br><br>  SMS is the most popular and widely used mobile channel, which is supported by all types of mobile phones.  This channel does not require an internet connection and provides communication in the presence of a mobile signal.  USSD is also a reliable and stable channel that is supported by all types of mobile phones and does not require installation of additional applications. <br><br>  It allows users to communicate through a text menu in real time through the background application.  Both technologies are ideally suited for REFUNITE requirements.  USSD allows users to search for relatives through the database, and notifications and alerts are sent via SMS. <br><br>  Also, SMS allows you to search the database - just send an SMS with the name of the person you are looking for.  The partnership of REFUNITE and Infobip allowed us to develop a complete solution.  REFUNITE launched and digitized a database, developed an application for the database and a background application, and Infobip provided technology for communicating REFUNITE with mobile operators-partners in the countries of the world where there are large groups of immigrants. <br><br>  Infobip can work as a single provider with several mobile operators, while providing coverage for SMS and USSD.  Both services have user-friendly menus in whose fields you can enter search parameters (name, age, last known place of stay) to get lists of potential matches. <br><br><h3>  Result </h3><br>  Providing the REFUNITE platform to offline users via SMS and USSD extends the search functions through the Refunite.org website.  The majority of refugees and displaced people do not have access to the Internet, and both services are used to restore communication between millions of separated families around the world.  As a result of this collaboration, REFUNITE was able to provide access to an online family search platform via SMS and / or USSD in the Congo, Jordan and Turkey.  In the future, the inclusion of countries such as Somalia, South Sudan and the Philippines. <br><br><h2>  Case 3. TLC Marketing - Campaign Management Upgrade </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f2/0ad/cb5/9f20adcb51864337b612876961c7de1e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Before the start of cooperation with Infobip, the TLC agency did not have sufficient technical capabilities to automatically check all incoming data obtained through SMS marketing campaigns and surveys. <br><br>  The bulk of the information was processed manually, and it became obvious that automating the process of verifying information would greatly simplify marketing campaigns.  TLC needed an advanced automation solution to handle SMS coupons sent by subscribers. <br><br><h3>  Decision </h3><br>  We created a premium SMS short number system to simplify the promotion campaigns, which allowed us to automatically process incoming information.  After that, a full-scale service was developed for the clients of the TLC Marketing agency - global consumer brands and retail chains.  Incoming SMS traffic generated by users sending promotional coupons via SMS is now automatically checked on the Infobip platform. <br><br><h3>  Result </h3><br>  Improved and accelerated campaign management.  Campaigns that were conducted for the largest retail chains in South Africa proved that the premium SMS solution was a convenient method of marketing communication with consumers.  This clear and easy-to-use solution is a key advantage for brands and retailers.  Our platform is able to process all incoming information, which simplifies and speeds up the whole process of promotional campaign, increasing its effectiveness.  Infobip also developed a specialized, marketing-oriented USSD system, which allowed TLC Marketing to offer its clients a full-scale service through another mobile channel and through a single provider. <br><br><h2>  Case 4. Croatian Post Bank - integration of automatic messages </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22f/047/e7d/22f047e7df14429482fa4ec25b6034ac.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Croatian Post Bank (HPB) is constantly working on the development of the main channels of communication with different customer segments, as well as on the development of modern banking services for users' requests. <br><br>  This approach includes instant access to banking services at any time and requires constant and intensive development of mobile and online banking.  Creating a modern communication platform that would fully adapt banking services to the requirements of modern customers was one of the priorities for HPB. <br><br>  It was necessary to improve communication with the client through automatic SMS-messages. <br><br><h3>  Decision </h3><br>  With the help of mGate (we already wrote about this solution <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/infobip/blog/313440/">here</a> ), the possibilities of communication with the client have significantly expanded, the bank has received comprehensive management of SMS messages.  Thanks to special options, mGate HPB can manage the sending and delivery of messages, receive reliable delivery reports and has the ability to answer user questions in case SMS has not been delivered. <br><br>  With mGate, HPB uses SMS to send: <br><br><ul><li>  account balance alerts, </li><li>  notifications about the reserved amount in the account, </li><li>  overdraft amount information, </li><li>  links to mobile banking services and mobile banking application downloads. </li></ul><br>  With mGate, HPB implemented a solution that satisfies all communication requirements with the customer, as well as provides detailed statistics and highly professional 24/7 technical support with a team of engineers and account managers. <br><br><h3>  Result </h3><br>  HPB has received an innovative customer-oriented service.  After four years of successful partnership, HPB and Infobip continue to work on new projects to further improve telecommunications and online solutions for HPB.  During this time, the mGate service has been updated and equipped with new features.  The bank has instant access to new options and applies the latest software. <br><br>  It includes an advanced professional SMS service that is used in other areas as needed.  Infobip has also developed solutions for smartphone applications and continues to develop new technologies and services.  Infobip is constantly working on improving electronic, mobile and online services for HPB. <br><br><h2>  Case 5: Mambu - SaaS platform communication solutions </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c48/a3e/6bb/c48a3e6bbb1749e9a7104531e39da380.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Mambu is an affordable and convenient cloud banking platform that allows you to quickly create, launch and maintain credit and deposit products.  Mambu's clients include more than 100 microfinance companies, as well as financial innovative companies from 30 countries.  The service serves as a more flexible alternative to outdated banking programs.  This service is customer-oriented and provides SMS services for the SaaS financial platform worldwide, using SMS messages as a channel of alerts and checks for banking and financial IT solutions.  The main task facing Infobip is to create an SMS service for the SaaS financial platform worldwide. <br><br><h3>  Decision </h3><br>  In one of the regular software releases, Mambu integrated Infobip's SMS API, quickly and easily joining our mobile messaging platform.  Mambu is now taking full advantage of the Infobip technology - this is coverage in 190 countries, extensive telecommunications experience and knowledge, and professional technical support 24/7. <br><br><h3>  Result </h3><br>  The introduction of the SMS API has enabled Mambu clients - microfinance companies located around the world - to send instant automatic alerts to their users via the SMS channel, as well as to increase security by introducing SMS-based two-factor authentication.  In the latter case, the SMS channel is used to deliver the verification PIN-codes that are required to access online services. <br><br>  If you are interested in any of our cases, write in the comments or vote below.
