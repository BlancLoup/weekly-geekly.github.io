Someone, due to the proximity to the then ‚Äúchiefs‚Äù, could get access to financial, administrative or informal opportunities, for example, Soviet sports (and evil tongues say that sports topics during the Soviet era were probably one of the mafia ones). <br>  Someone could have started with enthusiasm in the years of perestroika with semi-underground karate followed by friendly, on the basis of common interests, ties with the ‚Äúsiloviki‚Äù.  Now these citizens may well help young people to join the sport, being honorary members of the martial arts federations, or change life for the better, moving to the deputies. <br><br>  Since these companies, unlike those considered earlier, initially did not have some powerful economic topic that could be saddled, many of them at first took up a lot until they found something ‚Äútheir own‚Äù.

      Trading companies could start with the shuttle business, continue trading in household appliances, simultaneously running their own banking business (there‚Äôs a separate conversation here) and, finally, stop distributing medicines, stably over the years entering the official rating of the ‚Äúlargest interregional‚Äù, including constant participation in very large state programs. <br><br>  Some companies, having risen to their feet, may prefer to continue working in several areas: these may be simultaneous production of dairy products, furniture, and the implementation of judicial ‚Äúconfiscated‚Äù, combined even with an advancement in regional policy, which ensures good diversification of business and risks. <br>  Someone initially started with something one (the same furniture), gradually increasing production, creating a system for marketing products and capturing new markets (the federal market, the near and far abroad). <br><br>  And someone just makes life sweeter and more comfortable by distributing candy or plumbing. <br><br>  All these companies ‚Äúsurvived‚Äù, including heavy losses, and now their founding fathers are very wealthy and respected people. <br><br><h4>  But we will <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/286326/">talk</a> more about the state of the business, organizational and production processes of the heroes of today's post. </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285808/</a></p>
