  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Effective webinar checklist</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This list will help not to miss the little things that make up the impression about your webinar. <br><br>  It is better to start preparing for the event (especially for the first time) at least one month.  From the second to the third time, you‚Äôll meet in two weeks, but with each new speaker (my company organizes webinars inside the i-Branding service) we are laying a month for preparation.  This is better than transferring a webinar due to the fact that there are few listeners.  This, of course, is not about free events, everything is easier with them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  #one.  Formulate a goal </h5><br>  Yes, you will need to evaluate the effectiveness, but this is the second question.  In order to determine the target audience, the theme of the webinar and the platforms that you will need for advertising, you need to clearly define what you want to get at the exit. <br>  Why do you need a webinar?  Goals can be any, but formulated: make money, increase the level of "expertise" for subsequent monetization, retain customers or sell them something extra (if the webinar for customers), etc. <br><br><h5>  # 2.  Come up and pack a webinar </h5><br>  We assume that you are already a professional in a certain field and do not use Yandex keyword statistics for the selection of possible topics. <br>  What is interesting to your listeners?  What will be useful for them to know?  Think over theses, formulate the topic, pick up illustrations, and then describe the webinar in its entirety. <br>  If you already have a website, create a page, preferably on a subdomain.  If on your site it is difficult to organize a full registration and reception of money, use the service that will help you (commission from 7.5 to 30%).  At <a href="http://ticketforevent.com/pricing/">TicketForEvent</a> , <a href="http://welcome.timepad.ru/about/prices">Timepad.ru</a> , <a href="http://firmbook.ru/Billing/Tariffs">Firmbook.ru</a> , <a href="http://expertsystem.in/launch_now/plans_and_prices/">Expertsystem.in,</a> you can make full-fledged webinar pages with payment acceptance.  But in many cases, still better your site.

    <h5>  # 3.  Write letters </h5><br>  Prepare letter templates for listeners immediately.  Your feedback should be fast.  Members' contacts (name, e-mail) - if you do not use e-mail services, collect them into one file for quick distribution. <br>  Letters that you definitely need: <br>  - after the payment (‚Äúthanks for the payment, the links will send such and such a number‚Äù).  You can ask to talk about expectations from the webinar or just about yourself.  Listeners will be involved in the webinar in advance, and you will not waste time on acquaintance webinar. <br>  - to those who registered but did not pay (‚Äúit is not too late to pay‚Äù). <br>  - a reminder in one day. <br>  - a letter with reference to participation and clarification of time.  After several experiments, we send this letter on the day of the webinar, then there is no confusion. <br>  - a letter of thanks, a link to the recording, additional materials and a request to evaluate the webinar. <br><br><h5>  #four.  Find information partners </h5><br>  When you compile a list of sites where you can find your target audience, the best way is to call and get acquainted with potential information partners.  You will immediately understand whether they are interested in it or not, find out to whose name and to which e-mail to send a letter. <br>  The algorithm is as follows: <br>  - calls. <br>  - letters to information partners with a description of the event and conditions.  We usually ask to add information to the newsletter and banner on the site.  In exchange, we place the logo on the webinar website and inside the webinar, add the project presentation to the electronic ‚Äúrazdatku‚Äù.  In some cases, give a ticket to participate. <br>  - sending news and banner in the format of the site. <br>  - getting a link to posted announcements or a copy of the newsletter. <br>  - getting the logo and placing it on our website and inside the webinar. <br>  - the inclusion of information partners in the list of participants. <br>  All agreements and status are recorded in a separate file. <br><br><h5>  #five.  Choose a site for the webinar </h5><br>  Now there are a lot of them, so competition is more likely price.  We mainly use iMIND.  I cannot say that everything suits 100%, but there is no ideal system on the market yet (or we did not find it). <br>  There are a lot of options.  And you can try all the services for free, and then stop at one of them. <br>  <a href="http://www.gotomeeting.com/fec/webinar">GoToWebinar</a> : 30 days for free, up to 100 participants in the webinar. <br>  <a href="http://expertsystem.in/">ExpertSystem</a> : 14 days for free, then from 490 rubles / month. <br>  <a href="http://imind.com/">iMIND</a> : 14 days free (up to 10 participants), then from 750 rubles / day for 50 participants. <br>  <a href="http://webinar.ru/">Webinar.ru</a> : 14 days free, then 2995 rubles / month for 15 participants. <br>  <a href="http://fastwebinar.ru/">FastWebinar.ru</a> : for free. <br>  <a href="http://webinar.tw/">Webinar.tw</a> : 7 days for free, then $ 20 / month for 25 participants. <br>  <a href="http://firmbook.ru/">Firmbook.ru</a> : free for open events. <br>  Well, if you have a phone support site, even in ideal cases, you will need help.  If there are more than 40 listeners, then at least one of them will not open the link you send.  Just in case, find the FAQ for the chosen site, because if you conduct a webinar late in the evening, and technical support is not round-the-clock, you are left alone with problems. <br><br><h5>  # 6.  Prepare materials for the webinar </h5><br>  They may not exist at all, but their presence is better than the absence of: <br>  - splash file with info partners logos. <br>  - presentation (+ in pdf, because sometimes fonts behave unpredictably). <br>  - electronic "razdatka".  Usually this is an archived file with all the presentations and special offers of information partners. <br>  - audio recording for sound testing (if audio is supported by the pad).  Replaces "if you hear me, put a plus sign" and on-setting sound for all listeners. <br><br><h5>  # 7.  Before and during the presentation </h5><br>  - make sure the speaker is informed about the webcam, microphone, internet.  There have never been problems here, but it is better to be safe :) <br>  - remind the speaker that he should turn on the recording.  In the webinar mode on many sites, only the speaker has this magic button. <br>  - remind the speaker about a glass of water, the right background, disconnecting the phone and the sign "quietly, the webinar is on." <br>  - the assistant is right.  So that the speaker is not distracted, someone should help him in the chat.  If the webinar is large, then the speaker does not look at the webinar chat at all, receiving selected questions through the instant messenger.  If the webinar is small, then once every 15-20 minutes the speaker answers the questions asked in the chat.  When the webinar is educational, each question may be accompanied by an instant answer, but the event will look less organized. <br>  - ask the speaker to read the questions out loud, because answers in the recording are perceived without questions as difficult. <br><br><h5>  # 8 Sum up </h5><br>  - send the final letter to the participants and ask for feedback.  If the format of the event provides for this, invite listeners to a closed group on the social network. <br>  - if the webinar was open, post materials on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">www.slideshare.net</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">www.youtube.com</a> , <a href="http://www.skillopedia.ru/">www.skillopedia.ru</a> .  Publish news on your websites and information partners sites that a webinar took place, what was most interesting, give a link to a presentation or a video. <br>  - Go back to point # 1.  Have you achieved your planned goal? <br><br>  Successful webinars!  The realization of an idea is sometimes no less important than the idea itself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148764/</a></p>
