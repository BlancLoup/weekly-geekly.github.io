  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúFreebie, sir!‚Äù - why and for whom we created a free callback</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the very beginning of this year, we released the RedConnect callback service - the first service with unlimited talk time in which customers paid only for the fact of connection. <br><br>  Less than a year later, we are releasing a <b>free</b> callback - <a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect Free</a> . <br>  This article is about why we decided to make free demanded and efficient service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b2/228/17b/3b222817b41d47d2bd2ea5bdecea59d6.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why we decided to make callback free </h3><br>  After launching RedConnect, the euphoria quickly disappeared.  Yes, our service was good, and quickly took its place in the market.  But we had strong competitors.  And sadly enough - the curve of the number of registrations in the service has reached the ‚Äúplateau‚Äù - the growth has stopped.  This situation categorically did not suit us.

      We used all the ways to attract leads - we closely followed SEO, wisely used contextual and display advertising, did not disdain targeted ads and cross-promotions, and worked carefully on inbound marketing.  But the market was already divided, and a clear leader clearly emerged.  Which was decided not to win millions of advertising budgets, and the viral spread of the new product.  The choice was obvious - to make the service free. <br><br>  We understood that making a call back completely free was an impossible task.  After all, to ensure the work of RedConnect, you need to at least pay for telephony - and these costs for the callback service are quite substantial.  Then we decided to look at the problem of our customers from a different angle. <br><br>  Callback is ideal for small online stores and commercial sites, as they have an urgent need to quickly contact their customer.  But often site owners can not afford to spend the budget for callbacks, and work in the traditional way.  After all, they absolutely do not need many of the functions that RedConnect has - they are designed for larger and more demanding customers.  And the site owner simply does not see the need to pay for them. <br><br><h3>  How to make a free callback effective </h3><br>  We decided to create a tool that will allow us to close the problem with a minimum of costs on our part.  This can be done without compromising efficiency in only one way - to change the principle of the callback.  Watch our video and everything will become clear: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QKgBBWkTyIk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiAzO6rAJntE77bJ52IoiMLmJK_EA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  After the visitor has entered the phone in the form, <a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect Free</a> calls the operator, automatically substituting the number entered on the site.  The robot notifies the customer about the callback and asks to call back to the displayed number.  The operator needs just 1 click to call back the visitor.  From the moment the call is ordered to the conversation with the operator, the visitor will need the same 30-40 seconds. <br><br>  This method is much more convenient than sending an SMS or e-mail with a client number.  As long as the message reaches, until the operator opens it and reads it, until it dials a number ‚Äî minutes and hours may pass, the client will have gone to another site.  With <a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect Free, the</a> operator instantly finds out about the order of the call - just picks up the phone.  After that, it remains only to press the ‚Äúcall back‚Äù button. <br><br>  And if the operator does not call back?  We hope that this will be a rare situation.  After all, Internet business does not forgive mistakes, you need to fight for each client.  If an entrepreneur does not agree with this, then it is better not to even start a business.  Therefore, we have introduced a free callback rating system.  If the operator does not call back to the client, he can leave his negative feedback directly on the site.  When there are too many of them, we will disable this site. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd2/d8e/82a/cd2d8e82a9f14910b9c1918dd092645d.png"><br><br>  As a result, our direct spending on customer service comes down to paying those 10 seconds of telephony, which the robot spends on notifying our user.  But after all, these costs need to somehow be covered?  Not to mention the other, equally important - wages, office rent, etc. <br><br>  They will cover the profits from paid customers.  Of course, the paid version is not going anywhere.  And it will continue to buy.  Sooner or later, a small business will grow, and <a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect Free</a> will no longer have enough opportunities.  He wants to put the second operator on the phone, change the design of the widget, receive call tracking data or listen to records of conversations with customers ... Using our free service, and already knowing the quality of our products, the user is likely to switch to the paid version sooner or later. <br><br>  Before starting work, we conducted a study to understand how profitable our venture would be.  Here is what we managed to calculate: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a41/568/bd2/a41568bd252f4af59f7f35d6474c6a77.PNG"><br><br>  Do not forget about the copyright on the badge.  RedConnect and RedHelper get about 30% of new registrations precisely due to copyright transitions - among those who order a callback there are people to whom it can be useful for their own business.  The more sites that work with <a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect Free</a> , the more people will learn about our service. <br><br><h3>  The future of free calls </h3><br>  Naturally, we risk.  But we are wondering if we can make a truly useful and effective callback free for all comers.  Now we are waiting for your advice and recommendations on how to improve our service!  We are really interested in your opinion. <br><br>  Therefore, subscribe to our blog: in a week we will tell about the first results, share our clients' impressions and summarize the preliminary results of our venture.  And do not forget to recommend our service to your friends. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295472/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295472/</a></p>
