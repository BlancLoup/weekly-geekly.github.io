But since  I am very far from the sphere of programming, and there is no time to start learning this, I decided to turn to third-party developers with a request to implement one of my ideas for an <b>iPhone application</b> .  Then there was the search for this developer himself, who was successfully found in my hometown of Donetsk, on the advice of one of my friends. <br><br>  After discussing with the developer of all my thoughts and ideas, we chose the simplest, so that it is inexpensive and there is a chance to at least recoup the cost of development.  Who cares what happened next, welcome under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application arose during the next visit to the bank when I needed to put money on the card.  I was asked to fill out a receipt where it was necessary to provide contact details and the most important amount that I am going to put in words.  It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm an illiterate person, but to write a number, say 15412 (fifteen thousand four hundred twelve), sometimes causes difficulties :) And to pass for the face of a charming cashier a man who doesn‚Äôt know where to write a soft sign was somehow not wanted.  Then it occurred to me that it would be nice to always have a simple number-to-word converter at hand.  From that moment it all began.

      The design was painted by my familiar designer.  Yes, there are flaws in it, but the task was to be done quickly, functionally and inexpensively, in order to really learn all the subtleties of the development and publication of your own application with a minimum of investments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f6/ed9/089/3f6ed90896267b799ee3e6b21e4b036c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4e/e12/8be/f4ee128bedb21555765a16c04ee19211.png"><br><br>  I was born, grew up and live in Ukraine, so the translation languages ‚Äã‚Äãwere chosen quickly.  Ukrainian, Russian and English to make the application targeted to a wide range of users.  In the beginning, the idea was to make the application free, but with blocked languages ‚Äã‚Äãand the ability to unblock them by purchasing the desired language using the <b>‚ÄúIn App Purchase‚Äù system</b> .  But certain nuances arose and this idea had to be abandoned. <br><br>  A week after the meeting with the developer, the <b>Numwords</b> application was born, in the English version <b>of Numwords</b> .  A simple <a href="http://numwords.com/">website</a> was made, an <b>Apple</b> developer account was registered and a week later the application was already <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/numwords/id492221700">available</a> on the <b>App Store</b> at a price of <b>$ 0.99</b> . <br><br>  This is my first project.  If I see that for me there are some prospects in this direction, then in my head there are still many interesting ideas that I would like to realize.  I would like to wish all novice developers and enthusiasts like me prosperity, bright thoughts and good luck in my endeavors!
