  <section class="page js-page"><h1>That we implemented in EWM thanks to your advice</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is a post about how we bring to mind English Word Mania - a mobile application that helps enrich vocabulary when learning English and turns this process into a competition.  After the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430806/">previous publication,</a> we received valuable feedback from readers, which helped improve the simulator.  Under the cut, I will talk about what has changed and what we have managed to realize, remake, change, do better, and what we plan to do in the near future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dl/59/mg/dl59mgd_ty5ifadbyz7riphfuky.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Training and gameplay </h3><br>  One of the main problems in the previous version, which attracted the attention of not indifferent users of Habr, was the lack of the ability to fix unfamiliar words.  We collected numerous recommendations, analyzed them and understood what should be done.  In the next release, they provided an opportunity to choose unfamiliar words and add them to a separate individual dictionary for training.  At the moment, you can include up to 25 words in the dictionary. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ux/mr/gh/uxmrghkathlvbftdm9dubvarvjy.jpeg"></div>

      In the next version we will add the possibility of a single duel.  The team intentionally decided not to write a bot that would compete instead of live users, although there were such tips.  We are grateful to those who recommended such an approach, but we believe that we should not create an illusion.  Initially it was assumed that users will train with friends.  Practice has shown that the presence of dating is not a mandatory story, the presence of a live opponent is much more important. <br><br>  When testing the release in which workouts were added, we also saw that it was necessary to automatically add incorrectly answered words to the dictionary.  Such a function will appear in the next version, where, as I noted above, one will be a warrior in the field (ie, a single duel).  In addition, in the next version it was possible to start up to eight random fights, which also solves the problem of the lack of a partner.  There used to be one that limited the possibilities of users. <br><br>  We also changed the principle of transition to the next task, limiting the time for its execution and added a button to go to the next one. <br><br><h3>  Levels </h3><br>  This idea was also expressed after our previous article, and we followed the advice.  Now the dictionary is divided into 3 levels.  1000 words are provided for the first one, 2500 words for the second (including the first level dictionary), and 5000 words for the third (including the second one). <br><br>  Initially, it seemed to us that such a decision was correct, but now we have to make another evolutionary change and make several levels of complexity using the specified dictionaries.  Thus, it will be possible to segregate users by level of training, forming three different communities of competitors.  So far, our team is considering how to best implement it and plans to include it in one of the next releases. <br><br><h3>  Design </h3><br>  Oh miracle!  A designer appeared in the team and, as a result, a design that pleases us immensely.  Tastes do not argue, as long as we are satisfied with what is.  It seems to me concise and quite aesthetic combination of colors and fonts, which is used for the application.  Describe does not make sense, just post screenshots. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/es/c-/6n/esc-6n_nkdps1uxjcqcwuata8rs.jpeg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a-/y3/zz/a-y3zznxarzjqizrs71chhrkg74.jpeg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/jt/8w/aajt8w0e5xshem4xojqbnyeeyq0.jpeg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hf/vx/t9/hfvxt9js9_owimg2owvnyvprj4k.jpeg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jb/4u/vo/jb4uvoc9qd5uwjmbrgblsgirjmg.jpeg"></div><br><br><h3>  Advertising in test mode </h3><br>  Sooner or later it had to happen - we connected the monetization (in the form of annoying ads from Google).  Not so much for earnings as for determining how much scare and annoying advertising is.  Interestingly, before its appearance, there were fewer users (obviously, this is due to the fact that we made changes to the gameplay, hardly annoying videos became so attractive). <br><br>  If advertising becomes a significant irritant, then in one of the next releases we will offer a paid version of the application, devoid of advertising load.  It also makes sense to see how intermittent ads spoil the competitive process. <br><br>  After connecting the advertisement, angry reviews appeared on GooglePlay, which we were generally quite prepared for.  The fact is that we investigate how much of the advertising load is permissible, and for this we should identify the boundaries of failures. <br><br>  In addition, we ran into sanctions against the application.  It turns out Google Play requires placement in open sources privacy policy of the application.  I had to create it - the benefit was found a generator, which did help us with this difficult and legally confusing business. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  After the implementation of the current changes, we ourselves felt that the application became better, and the efficiency of the process increased.  The same feedback we receive from our small community so far, along with curses for advertising.  We not only improved the competitive and training process, but also got rid of many bugs. <br><br>  And it is obvious to us that with the next release the simulator will become even better, more interesting and closer to the aspirations of our potential users.  We are sincerely grateful to everyone who gave and gives advice.  We are convinced that thanks to them we will be able to make EWM as useful as possible.  We are grateful for any advice, recommendations, applications and are always ready for dialogue in the comments or in the personal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450114/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450114/</a></p>
