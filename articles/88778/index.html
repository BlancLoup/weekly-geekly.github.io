When <br>  three months have passed since Steve registered the business and name <br>  the company was not yet invented, he threatened to give the company the name Apple <br>  Computers, if colleagues do not come up with a better name within 5 hours. <br><br><h2>  CISCO </h2><br>  This is not an acronym, as many think.  This is an abbreviation for San Francisco. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Compaq </h2><br>  This name was derived from comp (computer) and PAQ, meaning small <br>  universal object.

    <h2>  Corel </h2><br>  This name is derived from the name of the founder Dr.  Michael Cowpland: COwpland <br>  REsearch Laboratory. <br><br><h2>  Google </h2><br>  This name began with a joke about how much information should <br>  index search engine.  First there was the name Googol, the word, <br>  denoting a number with 100 zeros.  Later, when the founders - Standford graduates Sergey Brin and Larry Page presented their project <br>  to the investor, they received a check issued in the name of Google. <br><br><h2>  Hotmail </h2><br>  Founder Jack Smith thought about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãaccessing mail via the web from any <br>  computer from anywhere in the world.  When Sabir Bhatia began working with <br>  business plan for the postal service, he went through all the names <br>  ending in mail and eventually made up the word from the word HTML. <br>  Initially, it looked like this: HoTMaiL. <br><br><h2>  Hewlett packard </h2><br>  Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard threw a coin to name the company, <br>  which they founded - Hewlett-Packard or Packard-Hewlett. <br><br><h2>  Intel </h2><br>  <b>Updated!</b> <br>  Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore wanted to name their company 'Moor Noyce', but this sounded like more noise, which did not fit the name of the company related to electronics, because noise in electronics is due to interference.  They used NM Electronics for about a year before they decided to use INTegrated ELectronics or Intel for short.  However, Intel was a registered trademark of the hotel chain, so they had to redeem the rights to this name. <br><br><h2>  Lotus (Notes) </h2><br>  Mitch Kapor took the name for his company from the lotus position, also <br>  known as padmasana.  The fact is that he taught <br>  transcendental meditation in the center of yoga. <br><br><h2>  Microsoft </h2><br>  Coined by Bill Gates to represent a company that creates <br>  MICROcomputer SOFTware.  Micro-soft was originally used.  Later <br>  hyphen has been removed. <br><br><h2>  Motorola </h2><br>  Founder Paul Galvin came to this name when his company began <br>  produce radio for cars.  Possibly due to the fact that the popular <br>  then the radio company was Victrola. <br><br><h2>  ORACLE </h2><br>  Larry Ellison and Bob Ots worked as consultants on a project for the CIA.  Code Name for <br>  project was Oracle (the CIA considered this system as a system that provides answers to <br>  all questions).  The project was supposed to help use the new programming language SQL, <br>  created by IBM.  The project closed with time, but Larry and Bob decided <br>  finish what we started and bring it to the people.  They have kept the name of Oracle <br>  and created an RDBMS.  Later they used this name for the company. <br><br><h2>  Sony </h2><br>  Created from the Latin word "sonus", which means sound and "sonny" - the word <br>  from American slang, meaning son. <br><br><h2>  SUN </h2><br>  Founded by four friends from Stanford University.  SUN is <br>  acronym for Standford University Network.  Andreas Bechstolsheim created <br>  a microcomputer, Vinod Khosla hired him and Scott McNealy to <br>  produce a computer based on it and bill joey to develop <br>  UNIX-based system for computer. <br><br><h2>  Yahoo! </h2><br>  The word "yeh" was coined by Jonathan Swift and was used in his <br>  book "Travel Gulivera."  It meant disgusting <br>  humanoid creatures.  The founders of Yahoo!  Jerry Yang and David Filo <br>  they chose this name because they considered themselves to be yeh. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88778/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88778/</a></p>
