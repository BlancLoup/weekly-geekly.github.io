  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet communications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I'm learning to PR.  I work in an Internet company.  On the subject ‚ÄúMeans of communication in JI‚Äù, they were asked to write a work on 2-3 pages on the topic of communication in the upcoming diploma.  My diploma will be related to the Internet, so I had to write about Internet communications. <br><br>  Faced with this topic, I realized that at the moment there is either nothing on this topic or this information is not on the Internet (I was searching for a long and hard time).  Therefore, I tried to write my own thoughts on the topic of Internet communications. <br><br>  I am writing here for the purpose: either to get a link to some kind of Internet communications scheme or, if there really isn‚Äôt, I ask the habra people to criticize or supplement my work if necessary.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The possibilities of communication on the Internet are quite extensive.  A certain classification of Internet communications has not yet been created, so I will try to create my own classification. <br><br>  In my opinion it is necessary to divide the Internet communication into 2 large sections - <b>internal</b> and <b>external</b> communications.  Internal - these are the ones that occur within your website (promotional website, corporate website, industry portal or online store).  External communications that occur outside the Internet space, which belongs to the company, such as: blogs, social networks, news sites, industry portals, search engines, and more. <br><br>  <b>Internal Internet communications</b> <br>  For successful internal communications, you initially need to have a well-prepared site.  During the development of the site, you definitely need to keep abreast, you need to understand all the advantages of your competitors, just look at foreign colleagues and perhaps come up with some original idea.  From the general recommendations: <br><br>  - News - if the company has news every half year, then it is better not to do such a section on the site, there will be only a negative effect from news of six months ago; <br><br>  - Products / Portfolio catalog - the more thoughtful the given section is, the better the content, the more product items, the more information about the product (ideally prices, but actual!) - the better will be the attitude towards your company; <br><br>  - Contacts, communication is also one of the most important points.  If you have an email address - the answer must be within 24 hours.  If a phone number is indicated, then it must be answered.  Ideally, if there are more interactive forms of communication: icq (instant messaging), Skype (Internet telephony), FAQ (question-answer, created for frequently asked questions), a forum. <br><br>  Also a good communication option is a company blog.  In a blog, company employees write various notes, articles on the company, there may also be unofficial information, such as corporate photos.  Blog entries can help your customers get in touch with company employees, show a ‚Äúhuman‚Äù face, for the openness of the company. <br><br>  <b>External Internet communications</b> <br>  External communications can attract attention, create a favorable image, show the viability of the company.  From working on external communications depends on whether they see your internal communications.  The main external communications include: <br><br>  - Advertising is the oldest and most common communication tool.  Advertising can be banner (graphic image on sites) and contextual (text ad) and other less common variations. <br><br>  - ‚ÄúSMM‚Äù (social media marketing) - this concept includes a large number of areas.  These include: promotion in blogs, forums, social networks and any other sources where communication takes place.  One of the ‚Äúexpert‚Äù tasks is to become one‚Äôs own in a certain group of potentially interesting people for the company (customers, journalists, politicians, partners, employees). <br><br>  - ‚ÄúSEO‚Äù (search engine optimization) - promotion in search engines.  It implies the adjustment of the site - its text content, as well as work on external sources (other sites) to increase the citation of the resource.  This work (optimization) with the right approach allows you to raise positions in the search engines, which allows a greater number of visitors to get to the company's website. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br>  Both communications are interconnected.  If external communications are not established, internal communication will not work.  If internal communications are poorly worked out, then no matter how they work on external ones, the quality of communications in general will be low.  Therefore, if quality work on Internet communications is necessary to work out both sides, and only in this case there will be a positive result. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41920/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41920/</a></p>
