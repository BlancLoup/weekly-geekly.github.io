  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Contact center as a service": convince the financial director that this is the best investment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Your financial management is convinced that investing in new technologies is not always easy.  Convincing them to invest in cloud technologies that they cannot touch and feel is an even harder task. <br><br>  Below are 6 points that will help explain to your guide the benefits of a cloud contact center, or how often it is called "contact center as a service" (ContactCenterasaService, CCaaS). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  1) Terms of payment: no advance payments and payment upon consumption </h5><br>  Let's start with the advantages that financial management is always interested in.  ‚ÄúContact center as a service‚Äù not only saves money and improves cash flow.  Capital costs for telephone switches, new handsets, additional space to accommodate servers, and additional electricity are unnecessary.  Delivered through the cloud, ‚Äúcontact center as a service‚Äù will not require additional infrastructure in your area.  Actual payment also implies a monthly fee only for the resources used.  What is particularly interesting is that the requirements change throughout the year;  You can start a project with several employees and plan a full-fledged contact center in the future. <br><br><h5>  2) Use expensive outdated equipment - money down the drain </h5><br>  Everything is even better - new equipment is not required, since the cloud contact center software is simply placed on existing equipment, therefore, only initial investments in old equipment remain.  The cloud kit does not contain any switches and handsets, and to start using it you only need to turn off the old system and turn on the new one the same day.

    <h5>  3) The development of the system does not require additional costs </h5><br>  The financial director is always responsible for the risks - what if the system refuses or will the premises prove unsuitable?  Can your organization have a fully redundant and secure telecommunications infrastructure?  ‚ÄúContact center as a service‚Äù does not depend on location.  This means that your operators and administrators can connect to the system anywhere.  This requires a telephone line (PSTN, SIP or mobile communication) and access to the Internet.  This will help if the weather suddenly turned bad, the building was flooded, the power supply was disconnected, or another emergency occurred in your territory.  Gartner, conducting a problem analysis, noted: ‚ÄúThe device‚Äôs‚Äú contact center as a service ‚Äùis basically so flexible that most organizations can easily adapt it to their own infrastructure.‚Äù  Why invest in expensive projects when the provider has already invested its funds in the project especially for you. <br><br><h5>  4) There will be no signals "busy" - you need less resources to respond to more requests </h5><br>  Unlimited subscribers do not hear the ‚Äúbusy‚Äù signal, since the large cloud capacity is easily integrated with the contact center, and the staff utilization optimization program guarantees the processing of calls and requests from social networks during periods of peak loads.  Getting more for less has always been the desire of financial directors. <br><br><h5>  5) Improved reports: do not waste time on spreadsheets </h5><br>  Contact Center as a Service provides management with great opportunities for management and control.  Real-time monitoring, detailed statistics and the ability to make changes to the configuration at critical moments - all this facilitates the decision-making process.  Real-time data allows supervisors to monitor the performance of operators and the entire contact center, as well as receive estimates of key performance indicators and service levels without using spreadsheets, which saves time and resources. <br><br><h5>  6) Reserve for the future or social networks </h5><br>  Whether you love them or hate them, social networks have become commonplace.  ‚ÄúContact center as a service‚Äù allows you to professionally process requests regardless of the communication channel.  For a cloud, the channel does not matter, requests come to the same place.  A social network is not an add-on when a specialist works with a contact center. <br><br>  When your CFO thinks about consolidating, developing a social network or opening a new contact center, tell him about the cloud contact center.  Its benefits are not only financial, they include reliability, scalability, business agility, security, the ability to change configurations when necessary, and also provide new methods of communication - and all this is paid for on the fact of use. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235427/</a></p>
