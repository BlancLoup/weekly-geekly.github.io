      In the 19th century, when the phrases ‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù and ‚Äúgreenhouse effect‚Äù did not exist yet, one of the scientists of the Russian Empire first thought about climate change on Earth, towards its warming.  He suggested sprinkling black ices over the Arctic dust.  The disappearance of the Arctic ice, in his opinion, should have significantly improved the climatic conditions of Russia.  On the coast of the Arctic Ocean, then bread would be thronged, rains would turn the deserts and semi-deserts of Central Asia into earthly paradise. <br><br>  In the 21st century, a person has a headache - global warming, and advanced minds began to wrestle with technologies that can be used to ‚Äútweak‚Äù the Earth‚Äôs climate.  There was even the term "geo-engineering", meaning intentional artificial change of the global climate of the Earth to meet the needs of mankind in a comfortable environment and expand the range of its habitat. <br><br>  Currently, pundits have already proposed the following measures aimed at changing the Earth‚Äôs climate: <br>  1. Installation of mirrors in earth orbit, in order to reflect the "excess" of sunlight into outer space.  A very expensive project that cannot yet be implemented. <br>  2. Spray sulfur in the atmosphere.  As you know, any volcanic eruption is accompanied by a short-term cooling due to the release of large amounts of sulfur.  A curtain of sulfur particles is a screen in the path of the sun's rays.  If I am not mistaken, for the first time I voiced the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing sulfur microparticles to contain global warming. Russian scientist Israel.  The disadvantages of this idea include the appearance of a threat to the integrity of the ozone layer of the Earth, as well as the loss of acid rain. <br>  3. Increase in albedo (reflectivity) of the Earth's surface.  There are a lot of proposals, especially I remember such original ones as putting insulating covers on glaciers, covering white rocks and deserts, genetic modification of woody plants (trees with specific foliage, reflecting more light) and planting them on large areas. <br>  4. Stimulation of growth and reproduction of unicellular algae (phytoplankton) in the oceans, which should contribute to the intensive absorption of CO2 from the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.  It is also possible to artificially obtain "highly productive" species of unicellular algae.  This method is associated with a fundamental restructuring of the ecosystems of the oceans, so that its application in practice is a big question. <br>  5. Artificial deposition of CO2 in the bowels of the Earth.  Recently, German scientists have proposed the creation of storage facilities for plant debris.  Recently, another original proposal of scientists appeared - the creation of artificial trees. <br>  This is not all ways of geo-engineering.  Most of them are still difficult to translate into reality.  Without a doubt, if in the future the climate ceases to organize human civilization or pose a threat to the existence of the species Homo sapiens, all sorts of technologies will be used. <br><br>  When implementing artificial global climate change, the moral aspect ‚Äúemerges‚Äù as well - how to set up ‚Äúclimate control‚Äù to suit everyone.  Even for people staying in the same room with air conditioning, the same set temperature can cause different sensations.  On the scale of the Earth, the number of people dissatisfied with the settings of the global ‚Äúair conditioner‚Äù may be much larger. <br>  It can be said with confidence that the climate will be in the hands of the superpowers, since the favorable climatic conditions on their territory will contribute to the most efficient economic activity, and therefore contribute to the growth of welfare. <br><br>  Author: <a href="http://www.priroda.su/item/372">A.V.</a>  <a href="http://www.priroda.su/item/372">Yegoshin</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39178/</a></p>
