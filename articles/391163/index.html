But the same word also means those who seize and rob ships for the purpose of profit.  Now we will talk about the second category of pirates, who are becoming more advanced in terms of technology. <br><br>  For every pirate, rich booty-laden ship is important.  And how do you know the appearance of the ship, what goods it is loaded, and how much this product is worth?  It is better not to guess, but to view the list of ships and their cargoes in the system of the shipping company.  This is quite a logical step that modern pirates have taken.  They <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pirates-hacked-vessels-2016-3">hacked into the</a> system of an international shipping company and obtained all the data about cargo ships, their schedule, cost and quantity of goods. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now the pirates act not at random, but according to plan.  Having seized the ship, they are looking for containers with the barcode they need to designate a certain product, take these containers and leave the ship without further conflicts and problems.  <a href="http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-digest_xg_en.pdf">The corresponding report</a> on the actions of pirates published by Verizon.  The company became interested in the actions of pirates after they abruptly changed the principle of their "work".  Previously, they seized the ship, hostages, and demanded a ransom.  Often it ended in tears for both pirates and hostages.

The team is closed in any room, and when in a few hours it is released one way or another, there is no one on the ship, and some of the containers with the most valuable cargo have been opened. <br><br>  According to Verizon experts, the pirates have downloaded malware onto the shipping network of the international shipping company, and thus receive valuable information about the ships, their cargo and schedule.  In other words, pirates know what to take, where to take and when to take. <br><br>  True, the pirates make some mistakes in the operation of the malware.  So, they do not use a proxy, they send commands to the software in plain text, which allows information security specialists to understand what is happening.  Now, however, the shipping company in question has already understood what is happening.  The server has been disabled, the passwords have been changed, and the IP addresses of the pirates are blocked.  But are modern pirates so simple, and will they surrender?  How to know. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391163/</a></p>
