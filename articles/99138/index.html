  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What will you choose?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Problem of choice </h4><br>  Our whole life is a choice.  Every day, every minute and even every second we have to choose.  We woke up early in the morning on an alarm clock and we thought - to get up for work or to lie for another half an hour and be late.  Then we decide what to wear, shod, how to get to work.  At work, we also constantly make some important and not very decisions.  Even during the lunch break we decide where, what and how much to eat.  After work, you need to buy home products.  Where is it better to do it - in the market or in the supermarket?  And for dinner you need something to cook.  And what exactly is borsch or soup, or maybe just a pizza to cook?  In the evening I want to relax, so much so that with benefit.  Can gather friends and somewhere to come off?  Or sit at home and watch some interesting movie?  Even on vacation, the problem of choice prevents us from relaxing ... <br><br>  And no matter what we do - we plan to repair, buy new equipment, look for work, arrange a personal life, or simply reflect on the meaning of life - we always and everywhere have to constantly make choices.  And neither men nor women are insured against it.  Choice is a common human problem. <br> <a href="http://one-of-two.com/"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2157174/oneoftwo.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Solution to the problem </h4><br>  But as you know, any problem in this life can be solved.  And we volunteered to help you with this.  Our team has developed a special service dedicated to the topic of choice in our life.  Now each user can vote for one of the two points put to the vote.

      The site <a href="http://one-of-two.com/">one-of-two.com is</a> very convenient to use, since all topics are divided into categories and you can only vote for the topic that interests you.  You can also view free polls as you add new polls. <br><br>  The site highlights both the most pressing issues and those that we rarely think about in everyday life, but still life puts us in front of them at the most unexpected moment.  In addition, here you can always find out the opinions of other users on the question that interests you, which will help you make the necessary decision.  Since each visitor has the opportunity not only to vote, but also to leave a comment and make your opinion public. <br><br>  If you are tormented by the problem of choice, which is not yet on the site, you have the opportunity to propose your vote.  To do this, you need to register and go to the "My Account" section.  The very next day you will be able to see your vote on the site and learn the opinion of other users. <br>  In the "Ratings" section, everyone has the opportunity to view the top ten most active users in three categories - by the number of votes, by the number of comments and by the number of proposed votes. <br><br>  Our site also performs a cognitive function.  Each voting point is accompanied by a picture (which removes the language barrier) and a full description.  That is, on the site <a href="http://one-of-two.com/">one-of-two.com</a> you can follow the news in the field of knowledge in different areas. <br><br><h4>  Social service </h4><br>  The site <a href="http://one-of-two.com/">one-of-two.com</a> is a social service.  All users have the opportunity to follow the new polls and ratings using the social networks "V Kontakte" and "Twitter", as well as subscribe to the news feed using the RSS channel to receive updates when the content of the site changes. <br><br>  The website development team does not stop at what has been accomplished and is constantly looking for ways to improve.  If you have any questions related to the site, or suggestions, you can contact the site administration at any time simply by sending a message in the ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù section. <br><br>  And do not skimp on the comments.  Remember that your every word can help another person to make the most important choice in his life. <br><br>  Some interesting facts: <br>  - The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãservice was born 2 years ago, because of the workload was implemented in the spring of this year; <br>  - The first domain for this project was with a grammatical error - <a href="http://my-choise.com/">my-choise.com</a> ; <br>  - to the current version of the design was still 4th; <br>  - This version of the design endured, at least two major changes in the structure after the launch of the project; <br>  - each page is sharpened by two keys; <br>  - before the launch of the project, there were serious concerns that the PS will poorly index the site, due to the ‚Äúcommon‚Äù concepts in the descriptions to the vote.  Fears did not materialize; <br>  - The most unexpected traffic from the PS, which constantly goes to the site- "cowardly" subjects.  Man pants and swimming trunks - our everything =) <br>  - Apart from the Vkontakte group and Twitter account, Habra is the first exit "to the people"; <br>  - Registration of new polls in the free time involved 3 designers; <br>  - It took more than two weeks to write this short article.  For me, websites are easier to do than to write articles, according to this - do not judge strictly. <br><br>  <b>Posted by Alexey Sergienko (info@kpd.pl.ua).</b> <br>  <b>UPD: All comments on his behalf.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99138/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99138/</a></p>
