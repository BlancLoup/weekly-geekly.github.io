  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electric wire law</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The dull autumn day was slowly approaching its end - the evening, the eternal harbinger of the night was already knocking on the door, and the people ... just the people ....  They did not yet know this, only rare animals, which were always distinguished by heightened sensitivity to nature, already felt the arrival of His Majesty NIGHTS. <br><br>  City.  An ordinary city, where thousands and millions of human beings walk, run, drive or fly from one place to another, driven only by understandable motives.  Take any of them separately, pull him out of the usual situation - a few concrete walls, furniture and other things that are just as usual for him - and he will not know at all what to do, where to go and what he aspires to.  But in his pack he has his own, he knows where to go and what to do, although sometimes he doesn‚Äôt even know that it‚Äôs not his thoughts and actions, something that he does, any other person can do, in general, any creature or even a soulless machine .  And all his dreams and aspirations are not his at all, but simply calculated by someone ....  Perhaps another human being standing a little higher on the ladder of evolution ... Why does a person do something?  He knows the answer, or just thinks he knows, but in fact there is no exact logic and answer? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why am I going to the city?  Why am I going right now and in this particular transport?  Do you know what a trolley bus is?  If not, you are lucky to be born on that part of the earth's surface where there is no water and no roads, and these same trolleybuses do not ride on them.  A plain metal box, placed on four wheels, which drives against two masts, too much like the whiskers of an animal, to be a product of human genius.  Some invisible energy comes to this box from above - yes, but do you know at least one person who has seen this Electricity?  I do not, but if you happen to meet him, do not forget to inform.  In itself, this electricity is deadly for such a fragile biological being as a man, although without it there would be no man himself, because his brain is one giant electric machine that controls the whole body.  A metal box consumes this energy in order to drive.  Well, just move back and forth using the same energy as a person.  Strange, right?  People think, dream, love and hate - and all with the help of this very electricity.  And the cars they invented cannot do this - all that this metal beetle is capable of (but we know that there are no metal boxes on the nature in nature) is to blindly obey a person‚Äôs will and drive back and forth like a blind kitten, obeying the law electrical wire.  What kind of law is this?  Very simple.  First of all, every living being that acquires the mind or just thoughts sets the laws.  And if trolleybuses could think, and they, no doubt, could, once, then they would formulate for themselves the main law - the law of the electric wire (I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the name, but if you hear a more precise wording, you must tell me).  The law, like all known limitations, is very simple (as far as the basic law of the universe can be, at least for trolley buses) - Follow the electric wire!

      Wow, well, I‚Äôve been thinking up here ... that it has managed me ... and everything is simple.  I‚Äôm going not just from point A to point B, according to a math textbook (but it‚Äôs stupid to take it from) and even our first math teacher in school (is there another demand from her - or is she stupid too ??) I'm going from the university (in all likelihood, this is the same point A, from which it all came, but even now this fact is for certain unknown), but where is it going?  Here it is worth remembering the law of the electric wire - I am going where the trolleybus is going, which means I can neither turn nor drive around that very point B. Otherwise, it simply cannot be, it follows from the very basic law of the universe for the trolleybus!  He must take me to ...  The usual terminus of an ordinary city.  And that's all. <br><br>  I am going and thinking.  This process is still unknown to our science, but all people do it (well, or almost all).  I think, it means I exist - once a famous person said, probably, in the mind of a trolleybus this revealing genius for human beings would be transformed into a series of electrical impulses, meaning - I follow the electrical wire, it means I exist. <br><br>  I had a bad day.  Even not, I‚Äôm a soul mate and I try to be polite - people around me who don‚Äôt know my thoughts, well, and the trolleybus is a typical representative of its kind, he also didn‚Äôt deserve to hear it.  I am damned today, just completely and disgusting, foolishly and stupidly unlucky!  And the point.  It's simple, right?  Yeah, I think so too.  Probably, the trolleybus also has a thought about this - because when someone turns off the electricity there, up above, the trolleybus also has no luck.  But he iron and survive.  And I do not, although sometimes I really want to become so.  And could change places, even for a minute?  With this same trolley bus ... know yourself to ride, you get life-giving electricity and you don‚Äôt think about anything - the law of the electric wire works for you, you only need to blindly obey it. <br><br>  And so I can not.  I have too many laws, rules, restrictions, permits, limits, directives, decrees, regulations, and everything else that must be obeyed.  But most importantly, people must obey.  Other people who just hit the right time at the right place and took the step a little higher than yours. <br><br>  Yes, today I have a hell of bad luck.  Probably, in this world, I don‚Äôt need anyone, since everyone I meet, just know that to remind me of the allotted step - hey, man, where are you, her, wait, your place is not here ... it is there ... below below is about to ... What would a trolley bus do in my place?  When nobody needs him, when he doesn't have his own electric wire - what does he do?  Probably he just stops, turns off, forgets about everything - about countless kilometers, driven back and forth, about hundreds and thousands of people who have visited him and moved from point A to point B. He probably does not die - it is inaccessible to the understanding of the trolleybus, since there is no such law, it just stops and forgets.  Forgets everything and everyone.  In addition to its main law. <br><br>  And man cannot do that.  I can't do that.  My heart does not want and can not just stop, stand still - it makes 115,200 beats a day and so every day, every week and every year.  I'm already tired of listening to his heartbeat.  Probably, someone else's heart beats, albeit just like mine, but it would be much nicer and more unusual to listen to him ‚Äî but I cannot do this either.  I can only stand here, near the window, hold on to the handrails and look sadly out the window, pulling out the fragmentary details of the landscape with my eye, which slowly, as if following the beats of my heart, sinks into the late evening darkness. <br><br>  Outside the window, everything is the same as in my heart - sad and bleak, simply because autumn, because evening, because it is going to rain and cold.  But in my heart it is the same - although it never rains there, it never gets cold and, of course, there are never evenings or nights there - it simply has no days off, the heart - it should work, always and everywhere, steadily tap out its rhythm , its main law is expressed even shorter - KNOCKS! <br><br>  Oh, we drive up to the fork - just several roads connect for one brief moment in one, to continue to disperse and go each other ... um ... dear ... For a person, the fork has always been a place of great sacrament - SELECTION.  After all, you can go along one road, but you can go along the next one - and it doesn't even matter that the traveler went before, now he needs to stop, rest and think about where to go next.  What is interesting - trolley buses also have such a problem.  Suppose they are not people, and the sacrament of choice is unavailable to them, but obedience to the law of the electrical wire requires that he go further - to where his wire leads.  But if the wire goes on both roads ?! <br><br>  That is why every trolleybus has an assistant - a person who takes upon himself the brunt and responsibility of the decision - exactly how the trolleybus should obey the main law.  Prudently following instinct, the trolley bus slows down, giving a person the right to choose and time to think. <br><br>  While we stopped at the fork, which is framed in the form of an ordinary circle - the ring road, on which you can leisurely go, choosing the desired route, passes by another iron box.  It is smaller in size, and much more free to choose where to go - it does not need to follow the main law.  And although it is arranged incomparably more difficult than any trolleybus, and it has one single main law, which is already expressed in only one word - GASOLINE.  I‚Äôm not exactly sure, but it seems to be a fundamental such fact - the higher the form of existence is organized, the fewer the laws and the shorter their wording.  The bus (and we met it was him), undoubtedly, is much higher in terms of organization and complexity than the trolleybus, therefore its main law is expressed in one word, and not in three.  But then for some reason it seems to me that we, people, are completely unnecessary - after all, we have laws and restrictions constitute the largest part of life - for example, go to any library and go to the shelves with a sign Laws. <br><br>  Something I thought ...  Probably it is not necessary ... better see what is outside the window ... n-yes, with such a mood, even Bill Gates, the Roling Stones group in full force and Abraham Lincoln with Muhammed Ali would hardly be there - it would hardly matter.  Just people.  Just cars.  Just a gray fog, timidly trying to warm up from the cold of its own rays with the rays of the treacherous sun.  Only‚Ä¶.  Wait ... Just on the bus that braked for a moment next to my window (and it‚Äôs definitely mine, I won‚Äôt allow anyone else to look through it) ... it appeared!  What was it really?  Just a girl who was sitting, like me by the window - maybe she was also a participant in the universal problem with arithmetic, the one about passengers who start their way from point A and arrive at point B ... Or maybe she is something else ... what something completely different ... at least for me ... <br><br>  What does my opinion express?  Is it really possible to see at least a part of my mood and inner feelings - the ones that even I don‚Äôt hear behind that 115,200 beats of my heart.  For a minute, no, not even for a fraction of a minute and a second, our eyes, our eyes met and crossed ... Exactly, they did not just meet and dispersed, like two peaceful ships in a calm sea, and did not converge in a deadly duel, like knights in armor - just crossed, as if saying to each other - hello, like you, I am a friend, and I will not do you any harm, do not be afraid of me .... <br><br>  There was a lot of things between us ...  First, dirty glass, which in fact is not even glass, but the most interesting sandwich from special safety glass and the thinnest transparent, but durable plastic film, rubbed with thousands of hands, touch it throughout its life.  Outside there were droplets of fog, which began to slowly occupy all the objects, as if banishing the sun's rays from there and declaring that from now until the morning everything belongs to them and their ruler - the nights.  Then there was still air - at that instant thick and saturated with moisture mixed with poisonous fumes and smoke from cars, and the subtlest aroma of flowers from a once-planted flower bed timidly and hesitantly mixed in with it, and a random wind brought scraps of a sweet, unusual smell - somewhere a chocolate factory was not far away.  She also had glass - the same cold and carried on a thousand feelings of hands.  But our views met vseravno, exchanged a tender greeting even through all these obstacles - after all, the eyes are a mirror of the soul, and does it have any obstacles for it? <br><br>  What did you want to tell me then?  I do not know, and even my heart does not know.  Moreover, I don‚Äôt even know what I wanted to tell you ... maybe nothing, maybe we both didn‚Äôt want to say anything at that moment, but just looked at each other and ...  and everyone looked, and our eyes already lived their lives, met somewhere halfway, embracing in the cold, pithing air. <br><br>  Everything that a trolley bus does can be described by the single law of an electrical wire.  Everything that a bus can do is also subject to the law, even simpler and more capacious.  Everything that a person does is possible and even needs to be described in the laws too - one must justify all these thousands of books.  But nowhere is there such a law or rule that would order you to do something in such a situation.  How do you understand what to do?  Does this traitor‚Äôs gaze betrayed the most intimate secret of the heart, which he himself did not want to realize and hid under the mask of all these 115,200 beats every day, every week and every year?  Or maybe he even gently took you by the hand and led you through the most secret passages and caves of my soul castle, showing you everything that has accumulated there over the centuries and decades, without hiding even the darkest and most dangerous dungeons? <br><br>  Or your look was so thin and penetrating that I myself, without asking anyone for permission, understood everything, just slipping over my eyes, just reading everything on my face, even if it was hidden behind the treacherous glasses.  Probably, I will never know all of this, I will not even know who you are and where you were going, what your name is and what is happening in your heart.  But I know something - in just a moment you realized that you need another person, even a distant look, connected with you by an invisible thread.  You understood it and did exactly what my eyes, my heart asked for all the time, but you couldn‚Äôt say your lips ... you just smiled at me ... <br><br>  Probably, for a trolley bus, everything that goes beyond the main law does not exist - after all, this cannot be understood, cannot be comprehended, and it cannot be controlled.  How is it so - not to obey the main law?  For us, people, it is possible.  Moreover, for us this is the norm, just an everyday phenomenon called life, existence without submission to the laws, the main laws, although when circumstances require it, people also obey them.  But in real life it is the other way around - we just live and sometimes, and some almost always do what is not written in any book, is not defined by any law, rule, instruction, directive or instruction - just smile, rejoice, sad, love , we are jealous, we are afraid, we regret, we cry, we get angry, we admire, we are proud, we despair, we are disappointed, we are discouraged, we go crazy, and we just live.  But what is the main thing in this endless process?  Accurate, measured heartbeats or chaotic and rambling thought-throwing?  Fast looks or slow steps?  Probably not ... I think the main thing is disobeying laws.  Laws that do not exist, which no one will ever write or even invent, laws that cannot be understood or remembered. <br><br>  Later, after a while, when I came home, I did all the necessary things (again obeying the laws) and went to bed, already falling asleep, I realized that there was still one law that I wanted to obey.  It is not necessary or necessary, but just want, most want. <br><br>  Probably, people are not the most perfect and complex creatures, because such a simple law is already expressed in three words, and this makes it related to the main law for a trolleybus, although, without a doubt, we are much more perfect than it.  The law is simple - always be grateful.  Therefore, may I not know your name, may I have seen you for just an instant, but now I can pass by a thousand times and I will not notice you again - thanks!  Thank you just for the smile!  Perhaps that evening, another star lit up in the sky, maybe that evening somewhere on the other side of the earth someone became a little richer, kinder, happier, someone got a winning lottery ticket, someone wrote his novel dreams, someone for the first time shed a tear, someone's heart first felt what it means to love, and someone first put a ring on a finger, maybe even someone died for the first time, first felt the pain and bitterness of loss, lost a friend, and someone was born a child, someone first fell off a bike or jumped with a parachute.  And someone just smiled, someone for the first time saw a sincere smile just like that and exactly when it was necessary, and for the first time I felt that someone was needed.  I don‚Äôt know if this is true - if you still meet this person, please let me know. <br><br>  <em><strong>PS</strong> Written on the basis of real events :) September 23, 2005, Ukraine, Lviv</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21423/</a></p>
