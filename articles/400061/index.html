The fact is that devices of this type are very convenient - they can be used to listen to music, as well as for talking on the phone, as hands free.  Madrobots team consists of tehnogikov, so we try to try all the new items that fall into our hands. <br><br>  It is clear that we are not able to test all the models that are on the market, but it‚Äôs good that we can check in work everything that we sell.  And now we offer a final rating of different models, compiled just on the basis of our testing of wireless headphones and analysis of their work.  It is clear that this rating is subjective, but in its preparation we tried to take into account a large number of factors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Motorola VERVE LOOP + </h3><br>  <b>Overall rating: 9.5</b>

As it turned out, the new headphones are a simplified version of the old ones, without a touch panel, without a number of fitness and other functions.  Fitness sensors are simply not here.  This made it possible to increase the time for listening to music, but at the same time, a number of users were disappointed.  You can work with them as a wireless headset.

The preferences of users of such devices can vary greatly, so we tried to indicate the headphones of a different form factor so that there was something to choose from.  All these systems have one thing in common: they are wireless and designed for athletes or just people who lead an active lifestyle. <br><br>  By the way, in my blog, we published a few more ratings, compiled on the same principle.
