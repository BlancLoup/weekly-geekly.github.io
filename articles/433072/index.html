This experience again revived my interest in the latest video game console SEGA - Dreamcast. <br><br>  The network can find a lot of documents, greatly facilitating the process of studying the issue.  There are two excellent resources that can quickly get everyone up to date: the wonderful Marcus Komstedt website, which describes everything, including the GPU registers, and the Jockel user resource <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/lets-build-a-sega-dreamcast-game-from-scratch-breakout.916501/">‚ÄúLet's create a game for Sega Dreamcast from scratch‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  While studying the car, I discovered a delightful story about how hackers quickly cracked the copy protection of games and destroyed the latest SEGA hardware hopes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  First level of protection: GD-ROM </h2><br>  On paper, the copy protection mechanism for the SEGA Dreamcast looked very strong.  Games were delivered on a special carrier called GD-ROM, which could only be produced by SEGA.  GD stands for "Gigabyte Disc" ("gigabyte disk"), that is, its increased recording density provided the maximum amount of 1 GB, which was much more than the capabilities of a regular CD-ROM (700 MB).

It contained a voice track that reminds the user that the contents of the disc are for the SEGA Dreamcast, and not for the CD player <sup>[1]</sup> .  The developer also added a track with text files, such as copyright information, and sometimes promotional materials, such as art from the game. <br><br>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãhigh density (light) stored up to 984 MB <sup>[2]</sup> and all the game content was located on it. <br><br>  Hackers seemed impossible to extract the game from the disk and burn it again for distribution. <br><br><h2>  Booting from GD-ROM: IP.BIN and 1ST_READ.BIN </h2><br>  Before we talk about how the pirates managed to copy games, we need to understand the boot sequence.  Dreamcast did not have an operating system.  There is a popular misconception that it used Windows CE, but in fact, Microsoft's operating system was just an extra static library that Dreamcast developers could connect to using DirectX, DirectInput, and DirectSound <sup>[3]</sup> .  In some games, WinCE was used <sup>[4]</sup> , but in the majority (for example, in Ikaruga) it was not used.  Regardless of what the developer used, the game with a fully connected OS and the Dreamcast always ran the same way. <br><br>  In normal use and launch of the official game on the Dreamcast that was just started, BOOTROM was launched, loading the bootstrap program from GD-ROM into RAM.  This tiny program, located on the last track of GD-ROM and known to the community as ‚ÄúIP.BIN‚Äù, displayed the SEGA licensed screen and performed two levels of bootstrap for setting up hardware registers, creating a CPU stack and initializing VBR <sup>[5]</sup> . <br><br>  More importantly, IP.BIN contained the name of the game executable.  This name was searched in the GD-ROM file system and loaded into RAM at 0x8C010000, after which the execution of the program was transferred there.  Usually, the executable file was named ‚Äú1ST_READ.BIN‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14f/fac/4a7/14ffac4a70c0af94444f819b03acf2af.svg"></div><br>  After the CPU went to the address 0x8C010000, the game was launched, as it should be. <br><br><h2>  Second level of protection: encryptor-scrambler </h2><br>  The theoretical possibility of hacking arose due to the seemingly unimportant ability of the Dreamcast to boot not from GD-ROM, but from a CD-ROM.  Initially, this functionality called ‚ÄúMIL-CD‚Äù was conceived for adding multimedia functions to music CDs, but was practically not used, with the exception of seven karaoke applications. <br><br>  SEGA engineers understood that the MIL-CD download could be used as an attack vector, so they added protection.  When the console recognized the CD-ROM, BOOTROM loaded IP.BIN in the usual way, but encrypted 1ST_READ.BIN, at first glance, at random.  The working executable file turned into a chaotic mess that caused the console to hang. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/377/512/b26/377512b26e5672bd9f78bc904dc9715d.svg"></div><br>  From this point of view, it seemed that the console was reliably protected.  Dreamcast could recognize a pirated copy of the game, spoil the executable file during the download process and defeat the pirates. <br><br><h2>  Give me my long sword! </h2><br>  The problem with the corrupted file was resolved when, at the end of 1999, the Utopia hacker team stole Katana SDK (the official Sega SDK for the Dreamcast) <sup>[6]</sup> .  It turned out that the scrambler was nothing more than the implementation of the principle of "security through obscurity".  The SDK contained a reverse-scrambler, which turned the correct executable file into a ‚Äúreverse jumble‚Äù, which again became an executable file after loading and scrambling with the Dreamcast console when booting from a CD-ROM. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/102/4e1/0b5/1024e10b5ec8dfd9b9604248728e9e83.svg"></div><br><h2>  Extracting the game from its GD-ROM </h2><br>  A stolen SDK is all the pirates needed.  Thanks to the ability to run the code on the machine, the Dreamcast could now be used not as a gaming console, but as a GD-ROM drive.  The ‚Äúcable for the encoder‚Äù from the SDK <sup>[7]</sup> allowed connecting the console to the PC and establishing a physical connection.  In order for the console to create a dump of the contents of the GD tracks, a special executable file was written.  Then it was reverse-scrambled and burned onto a CD-ROM in order to output all 1 GB of data through the serial port of the console.  It was an error-prone process that took up to 18 hours <sup>[8]</sup> <sup>[9]</sup> .  The result was saved in a specially created format ".gdi". <br><br><pre>  ikaruga.gdi 153 bytes
 track01.bin 1382 640 bytes
 track02.raw 2,088,576 bytes
 track03.bin 1 185 760 800 bytes </pre><br>  <b>Interesting fact</b> : you can see that the total amount of data is not 1 GB, as mentioned above, but 1.2 GB.  This happened because the GD-ROM sector‚Äôs 2352-byte sectors follow the ‚ÄúRed Book‚Äù format, in which 12 bytes are used for synchronization, 4 bytes for the header, 2048 bytes for the payload and 288 bytes for the Error Detection Code / Error Correcting Code <sup>[10 ]</sup> . <br><br><pre>  $ cat ikaruga.gdi

The ISO-9660 file system used in GD-ROM made it easy to change the discretization of videos and music, as well as completely remove them.  However, for most games such a complex process was not required, because they did not occupy the entire 1 GB.  For example, Treasure's Ikaruga occupied only 150 MB, and most of its content was filled with zeros.  In such cases, simple editing of the fill data was sufficient. <br><br>  In fact, ISO-9660 is such a well-known format that simple Python scripts (for example, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dcisotools/">gditools.py</a> ) were even written to <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/dreamcast_hacking/gditools.txt">examine the</a> contents of the .gdi archives. <br><br><h2>  Packaging and distribution </h2><br>  The last two stages of the process involved reverse scrambling 1ST_READ.BIN and packing all the information into the .cdi archive so that <a href="https://legacy.padus.com/">DiscJuggler</a> could burn the image to a CD-R.  The result obtained without any problems worked on any vanilla Dreamcast without the need for a chip modification. <br><br><h2>  SEGA reaction and consequences </h2><br>  SEGA quickly released the second version of the DC console with the MIL-CD completely disabled, but the damage was already done.  After a catastrophic fall in revenues and the release of a competing PS2, the developers abandoned the Dreamcast and SEGA withdrew from the development of hardware, concentrating entirely on software development. <br><br><h2>  Reference materials </h2><br>  [1] Source: <a href="https://www.consolecopyworld.com/dc/gd-ws/gdws_big/sld009.htm">SEGA GD Workshop</a> <br>  [2] Source: <a href="https://segaretro.org/GD-ROM">segaretro.org: GD-ROM</a> <br>  [3] Source: <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/1999/03/16/microsoft-announces-windows-ce-toolkit-for-dreamcast/">Microsoft Announces Windows CE Toolkit for Dreamcast</a> <br>  [4] Source: <a href="https://segaretro.org/Windows_CE">Dreamcast games utilizing Windows CE</a> <br>  [5] Source: <a href="http://mc.pp.se/dc/ip.bin.html">IP.BIN and 1ST_READ.BIN</a> <br>  [6] Source: <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/lets-build-a-sega-dreamcast-game-from-scratch-breakout.916501/page-3">Let's build a Sega Dreamcast game from scratch</a> <br>  [7] Source: <a href="http://mc.pp.se/dc/serifc.html">PC Serial Adapter</a> <br>  [8] Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamcast/comments/15pww3/a_more_accurate_and_indepth_look_at_the/">A more accurate and in-depth look at the Dreamcast's security</a> <br>  [9] Source: <a href="https://assemblergames.com/threads/dumping-dreamcast-gd-rom-gd-r-discs.16679/">Faster ways were the last, using the DC's broadband connector</a> <br>  [10] Source: <a href="https://xiaopang333.wordpress.com/2008/08/06/dreamcast-myth-gd-rom-storage-capacity/">Dreamcast Myth: GD-ROM Storage Capacity</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433072/</a></p>
