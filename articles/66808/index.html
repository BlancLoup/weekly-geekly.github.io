  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Japanese Parable: Tea Master and Samurai</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><habracut>  One day, a tea master walked down the street with a large tray lined with cups and tea cans.  Suddenly, a furious samurai fell out of a small grocery store on the street.  The tea master tried to give way, but the samurai, who did not notice anything around him, still ran into him.  The tray fell, the cups broke, and the tea leaf powder spilled on the samurai sleeve. <br>  “Look where you're going,” the samurai growled. <br>  “I'm sorry, sir,” said the tea master politely, trying to clean off the green powder from the samurai sleeve. <br>  “Get your hands off,” the samurai bellowed. <br>  The tea master pulled his hands away, but inadvertently touched the hilt of a sword hanging from a samurai on his belt. <br>  - You touched my sword!  - the samurai was indignant. <br>  His eyes sparkled with anger. <br>  - I beg your pardon, sir.  - The tea master bowed. <br>  —You touched my sword!  You want to insult me ​​- better hit on the face.  It will be less insulting than touching my sword. <br>  “But listen, sir,” the tea master tried to reassure him.  “I didn't touch your sword on purpose.”  It happened by chance.  Please forgive me. <br>  - Late ask for forgiveness.  - The samurai was very determined.  - I'm Genji.  I'm calling you to a duel.  Tomorrow night come to my house.  Do not forget to take the sword. <habracut><br>  Samurai proudly retired.  The tea master with trembling hands gathered what was left of the cups.  He did not have a sword, and he absolutely did not know how to handle weapons. <br>  The tea master returned home, picked up new cups and tea, and hurried to his pupil's house for a tea ceremony.  He was late, and the student - a rich and powerful man - asked where the master was late.  Tea master told about the collision with a samurai. <br>  - You say his name is Genji? <br>  “Yes,” the tea master replied. <br>  - And will you fight him? <br>  - Have to. <br>  “So you can be considered a dead man,” the rich man announced.  - Genji is a strong fighter and does not forgive insults.  If you enter a duel, he will kill you. <br>  “Then let's move on to the lesson,” suggested the tea master.  “Looks like this is the last lesson I can give you.” <br>  In the evening, the tea master went to visit his friend, the blacksmith, the master of making swords.  As usual, they were sitting next to each other and drinking sake. <br>  “What's the matter with you, mate?”  - asked the blacksmith. <br>  “I want to ask you to sell me a sword,” said the tea master. <br>  The smith smiled. <br>  - Listen, friend, you yourself know that I have been making every sword for several years - especially for the customer.  Since when did you need a sword? <br>  “From today,” the tea master replied. <br>  He told a friend a story with a samurai.  The blacksmith listened with bated breath. <br>  “You see, I really need a sword.”  Maybe lend me one - any.  I’ll arrange with Genji's assistants to get you back when it's over. <br>  The smith was silent for a long time.  In the voice of a friend, he heard a firm decision to die. <br>  “If you really die,” the blacksmith said at last, “then why would you die as a newcomer who picked up a sword for the first time?”  It is better to die for who you are - the master of the tea ceremony, one of the best masters of our time. <br>  The tea master pondered over the words of the Friend, then got up, patted his friend on the shoulder and, without saying a word, went out into the night street. <br>  Having made the final decision, he went to the house of Genji.  At the gate was one of the samurai assistants. <br>  “Please pass on my invitation to Mr. Genji,” said the tea master.  - I remember that tomorrow night we have a duel, meeting here at the gate of his house.  But I want to invite him tomorrow afternoon to my tea house.  I want to give him a gift. <br>  The next morning, the tea master got up early to prepare for the arrival of the samurai.  He swept the path and cut a bush near the tea house.  He prepared the table and the instruments, arranged the flowers in simple but elegant bouquets.  Then he carefully cleaned his best kimono and put it on.  Now everything was ready, and the tea master went to the gate to meet the samurai. <br>  Soon there was a samurai with two servants.  The tea master bowed. <br>  “Very glad you came,” he said. <br>  - I was told something about the gift.  - On the face of a samurai a mocking smile appeared.  - Do you want to offer a ransom, so I refused to fight? <br>  “That you, sir, of course not,” replied the tea master.  - I would not dare to offend you so. <br>  He invited the samurai to go to the tea house, showing the servants a bench in the garden and asking them to wait. <br>  - Well, if not a ransom, then you will ask to save your life? <br>  “No,” the tea master replied.  - I understand that you should get satisfaction.  But I ask you to allow me to show my work for the last time. <br>  They entered the house, and the tea master invited the samurai to sit down. <br>  “I am the master of the tea ceremony,” he explained.  - The tea ceremony is not only my work and my art, it is my embodiment.  I ask you to let me work the last time - for you. <br>  The samurai did not quite understand, but knelt down and showed with a nod to the tea master that he could begin. <br>  The simple decoration of a small tea house created an atmosphere of comfort and tranquility. <br>  Outside came the rustle of leaves and the murmur of a stream.  The tea master opened a box of tea, and the smell of green tea mixed with the scent of flowers on the shelf. <br>  Slowly, calmly, with precise movements, the tea master poured some tea powder into the cup.  Then he scooped up a special spoon of hot water from the boiler and poured it into the cup.  The samurai looked at the ceremony, enchanted by the beautiful and confident movements of the master.  With a small spatula, the tea master whipped the tea powder with water until frothy, poured hot water, handed the cup to the samurai, and bowed to him, maintaining complete calm and concentration. <br>  Samurai drank tea.  Returning to the tea master a cup, he noticed that he was still calm and at the same time focused and attentive. <br>  “Thank you,” said the tea master, when the samurai rose, about to leave.  “Now I am ready to go with you to your house to start a fight ...” <br>  “There won't be a duel,” the samurai declared.  - I have never seen such calm and confidence before a fight - none of my opponents.  Even today I was nervous, although I was sure of my victory.  But you ... You not only kept complete peace of mind, but were able to convey calm to me. <br>  The tea master looked into the samurai's eyes, smiled, and bowed low.  The samurai responded with a lower bow. <br>  “Master,” the samurai said.  “I know I’m not worthy, but I ask you to be my teacher.”  I want to learn the art of the tea ceremony in order to gain the confidence and calm that I lack so much. <br>  - I'll teach you.  We can start tonight, because we have already made an appointment.  I will collect everything I need and go to your house. </habracut></habracut></div>
