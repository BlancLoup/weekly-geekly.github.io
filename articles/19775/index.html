  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Accelerate your website: gamma version</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About three weeks ago <a href="http://webo.in/">, a project was launched</a> dedicated to methods for optimizing the load time of a web page on a client. <br><br><h2>  Why optimization? </h2><br><br>  In my opinion, at the current time, web developers pay very little attention to <em>accessibility</em> and <em>usability of the</em> projects they are working on.  For them, the site is kilobytes of code and a couple of pictures that you need to somehow show to the client.  At the same time, no one thinks about the user, at best, hiding behind expressions such as: ‚Äúhere and so everything loads quickly from me‚Äù or ‚Äúthe channels are not the same 10 years ago‚Äù.

      <br>
      Yes, and the channels have become faster, and the cars - more powerful.  But the web also does not stand still, and the software sometimes develops faster than the hardware that can serve it.  That is why optimization was and is a sign of excellence, and only a few developers understand and pay due attention to it.  That is why a <a href="http://webo.in/">resource has</a> appeared that is entirely and completely focused on problems, methods, techniques and solutions in the field of optimization of the client part of the web. <br><br><h2>  Why client side? </h2><br><br><blockquote>  At the moment, among web developers there is a common misconception that the speed of loading a web site in a client browser is completely determined by the time it takes to generate an html page on the server. </blockquote><br><br>  Naturally, this is not the case.  Loading a page is not just HTML.  There are many tools that make sure of this, analyze the whole process and find weak points in it.  But it is precisely this kind of analysis, which is, in fact, on the user's side and should be carried out first of all when assessing the availability of a website, often not doing it at all or doing it quickly and poorly.  But it may allow to <strong>reduce the page load time by an order</strong> . <br><br> <a href="http://webo.in/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/84d/e03/e69/84de03e69e3275f110549b90fbd4a7bb.gif" width="450" height="304" alt="WEBoptimizator" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Another analyzer? </h2><br><br>  First of all, <a href="http://webo.in/">WEBoptimizator</a> is a <strong>reference resource</strong> .  It has already posted several <a href="http://webo.in/articles/">dozens of translations</a> , analytical publications and reports from Russian conferences, as well as a <a href="http://webo.in/articles/">couple of video recordings</a> solely on the subject of client-side optimization.  This topic is very poorly covered in the Russian Internet, so new materials appear and will appear regularly. <br><br>  Secondly, it is an <strong>online tool</strong> for analyzing the download speed of any site.  It is comparable with analogues existing in the foreign Internet, and it greatly surpasses them in the number of practical tips and references to relevant materials.  This is a reference service that allows specific examples to find and eliminate the bottlenecks when loading a page, to carry out a point optimization of any site.  I want to emphasize that the main focus is not on the accuracy of verification (it now exceeds 99%), but on the detail of advice and the number of informational references to the necessary sources. <br><br>  More details about the prerequisites for the emergence of the project and the situation in this area <a href="http://webo.in/about/">can be found here</a> <br><br><h2>  Who is this project for? </h2><br><br>  Initially, <a href="http://webo.in/">WEBoptimizator is</a> designed, of course, for webmasters and web developers of various specializations and professional levels.  However, the posted materials on <a href="http://webo.in/articles/habrahabr/03-presentation-layer-performance-tuning/">optimization</a> , <a href="http://webo.in/articles/habrahabr/05-delayed-loading/">techniques</a> <a href="http://webo.in/articles/habrahabr/04-speed-up-events-handlers/">for</a> <a href="http://webo.in/articles/habrahabr/01-how-javas-cript-slow-down-web/">JavaScript</a> , <a href="http://webo.in/articles/habrahabr/10-css-expressions-optimization/">CSS</a> <a href="http://webo.in/articles/habrahabr/07-gzip-all/">techniques</a> , <a href="http://webo.in/articles/habrahabr/08-all-about-css-sprites/">CSS sprites</a> , <a href="http://webo.in/articles/habrahabr/06-client-side-balancing/">client load balancing</a> , <a href="http://webo.in/articles/habrahabr/11-minifing-javas-cript/">compression</a> and <a href="http://webo.in/articles/habrahabr/14-minifing-css/">archiving</a> cover a wide range of issues that will be of interest to a wide range of professionals.  Most likely, everyone will be able to find something new for their own improvement. <br><br><h2>  What's next? </h2><br><br>  A site without users is dead, like a book without readers.  But the book will not be read if it is boring and banal?  It seems to me that the natural way to form such a project would be to create a community of users who both care about the quality of their sites and help others to understand and understand their specific problems.  However, in this case, I want to focus more on the professionalism of the main participants, rather than creating a regular ‚Äúsmoking room‚Äù on free topics.  Probably, in the near future, the <a href="http://webo.in/">project</a> will have all the attributes of Web2.0 service: tag clouds, <a href="">RSS</a> , ratings, mushaps, etc.  But this is not the main thing.  The main thing is the people for whom all this will work, or who themselves will work on it. <br><br>  At the moment for the project you need: <br><br><ol><li>  <strong>Hosting site closer to the central hub.</strong>  The traffic resource currently generates not so much (mostly incoming) and the load from it is small, but a good channel is required to access any arbitrary website.  Now there are some problems with access to certain resources. </li><li>  <strong>Design and graphic thingies.</strong>  Now the design is made in a minimalist style, perhaps its concept should be reviewed and make the project more vivid and memorable. </li><li>  <strong>Algorithms and additional tools.</strong>  When analyzing download speeds, everything is still not calculated correctly, and there are several ideas for creating a number of auxiliary services. </li></ol><br><br>  If someone has thoughts on any of the points - they can be written right here in the comments or discussed with me in private in more detail.  I would very much like to receive a response from the community, because the project was created as a working tool, and here the main thing is to ‚Äúsharpen your ax in time‚Äù :) <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who reads and comments on my articles and translations.  Now I appeal to you with a request to help improve what you will use (or are already using) - <a href="http://webo.in/">WEBoptimizator</a> .  I will be glad to any of your thoughts and thoughts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19775/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19775/</a></p>
