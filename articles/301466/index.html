  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to keep track of news in the C ++ world</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Trying to continuously replenish my knowledge of C ++, I have identified for myself several channels of getting information on which to concentrate.  They may perhaps be applicable to other areas of knowledge, but I will try to focus on C ++.  Let me tell you a little more about them. <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Thoughtful reading</b> - reading fundamental books, structured and informative.  This requires prolonged concentration, and you should not read in a state of fatigue, because you simply fall asleep and remember nothing.  If you do not have an e-reader yet, be sure to buy it. </li><li>  <b>Easy reading</b> - reading less serious literature like books about motivation, productivity, Soft Skills.  All this is in vain underestimated by some programmers.  These books do not require much concentration.  Yes, this is absolutely not about the C ++ language, but it is about how to do something at all and still do it.  Well read before bedtime. </li><li>  <b>Podcasts</b> - go well when you need to switch from something one to another, or while shopping.  Helping to look at something unexpected.  They practice the ability to listen and understand what they hear, which can be a useful skill (for example, to attend meetings).  If English is not native to you - you can hear the terms and names pronounced.  I recommend listening to <a href="http://cppcast.com/">CppCast</a> or <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">Software Engineering Radio</a> - I was pleasantly surprised by their broad coverage.  The first episode was released in 2006, the podcast half consists of the history of software engineering and half of the theory (patterns, problems, solutions, etc.) </li><li>  <b>Videos and lectures</b> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon">CppCon</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BoostCon">CppNow</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MeetingCPP">Meeting C ++</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw">ACCU Conference</a> to start.  There are just a staggering number of interesting reports.  Unlike podcasts, this requires visual attention and concentration, but as a result you can learn more.  I think viewing 2-5 videos per week is quite achievable. <br>  <b>Tip</b> : increase the speed of audio / video - the brain quickly gets used to this speed and you can hear more in less time. </li><li>  <b>Discussions, forums, twitter</b> - this channel of information exchange requires the least concentration.  You can quickly see the discussions, Twitter feed in search of something interesting - just killing time.  If something is found, you can add it to the list for reading later.  How is all this useful - a huge variety of people, opinions, approaches, tasks and solutions.  A good way to disperse your brain with very random information. <br><br>  For example, my list of <a href="https://twitter.com/DVMirchev/lists/core-c/members">Core C ++</a> to keep track of the significant C ++ developers in the world.  And there are several pages and groups on Facebook and some good <a href="https://meetingcpp.com/index.php/blogroll.html">reviews from Jens Weller</a> .

      For discussions on C ++, there is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/">section on Reddite</a> (approx. Translator: and there is also a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/hub/cpp/">hub on Habrahabr</a> ).  And, of course, the C ++ Standardization Committee <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/">groups</a> </li><li>  <b>Blogs and articles</b> usually take 5-10 minutes to read the average article.  If there is a deeper article - you can mark it for reading "when I will be concentrated."  According to my observations, there are 5-10 good articles per week and it is not so difficult to read them all. </li></ol><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Important notes </h4><br><br><ol><li>  <b>Interest groups</b> - nothing replaces face-to-face communication.  At such meetings you can meet interesting people and even make friends.  If you can't find a group in your area - maybe you should create it?  I work on one such group and we had no particular problems. </li><li>  <b>Sport</b> - gives you a supply of vitality and promotes the development of cognitive skills.  Yes, everyone says it, but I am already ‚Äúon the way‚Äù as I am close to starting to practice regularly.  I will start tomorrow, I promise. </li><li>  <b>Teaching</b> - if you want to learn something - start teaching it.  There are many opportunities - you can make presentations for your colleagues, or make presentations in an interest group, write a blog or teach courses. </li><li>  <b>Time to think</b> - this is also often underestimated.  It is good to be able to look back, think about what has already been done and plans, and why your plans are not yet in the section of what has already been done. </li><li>  <b>Lists of great things</b> - there are several, for example, <a href="https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp">Awesome C / C ++</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rigtorp/awesome-modern-cpp">Awesome Modern C ++</a> . </li></ol><br><br>  As with any other problem, tracking the C ++ world depends on how you approach the matter: it is important to determine the most appropriate training methods and capabilities of your brain and body.  It seems to me that all of the above methods of obtaining information are important because they supply data of different types.  You should at least be aware of their existence and from time to time ask yourself why you are not using this or that method. <br><br>  I found for myself that simply this classification of ways of obtaining information already helps in planning both daily tasks and long-term training.  For example, if you have 1 hour of free time - you should not read Twitter or blogs.  It is better to read a couple of articles or a book chapter.  A twitter and a forum can be checked and waiting in line for your coffee.  Or, for example, you find that you have not watched videos from C ++ conferences for a long time - perhaps it's time to set aside an hour tonight? <br><br>  It is also worth making an amendment to your current state.  I sometimes have time to read, but I‚Äôm too defocused for a serious book.  In this case, I watch a video or listen to a podcast.  If you are rested and full of energy - do not waste time on a social network.  Take that very long article that has been gathering dust in your ‚Äúmust-read‚Äù section for six months now - it's about time.  Always, I repeat, always (!) Have on hand a book that you are currently reading. <br><br>  Also do not forget that programming is improved by practice.  The read should be compiled, debugged, improved, broken, repaired, tested, measured - and then with some probability we can say that you understood what we were talking about.  Without practice reading is useless. <br><br>  And still important family and work.  And getting enough sleep is also important.  Very important.  And relax from the computer.  My rough estimate of the time spent on all of the above is 30-40 hours per day - that should be enough.  And the rest of the time do what you want. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301466/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301466/</a></p>
