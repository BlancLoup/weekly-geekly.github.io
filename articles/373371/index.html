The reading was over, and the feeling of insecurity gradually gave way to fatigue. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll the same, they nakosyachat, how to drink, nakosyachat,‚Äù he thought.  - The country of "universal higher", and the principle of the device of the refrigerator for the majority is a mystery, and each installer has his own idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich side to fix the part.  Country-wide Murphy's law is scary.  But even worse, when it turns out that the error was in the project.  The hard worker will be deprived of the prize from power, the engineer will be eaten alive.  The most annoying thing is that the implementation problem casts a shadow on all the bureaus.  Claims, proceedings, examination.  We will then explain with the whole team why we did not design this beam so that it could be fixed only in the only correct position.  And if, God forbid, victims?  In this damn bridge only 16 tension cables are used.  You can lay a double or triple margin of safety, it is possible to provide for the destruction of one or two pillars, but human error is a poorly predictable thing.  For that matter, errors are almost inevitable in any large project, and everyone desperately needs such a changeable factor as luck.  Moreover, these clever people from the state registration center, they all strive to turn it upside down.  The state commission is, of course, hard, but it's better that way.  At the very least, he will be pointing a finger at anyone, although we will still be at the edge. ‚Äù <br><br>  He got up from the table and wandered into the living room.  On the way I looked in the mirror and turned away with displeasure.  Having thrust his hand into the pocket of his jacket hanging on a hanger, he fished out his mobile phone and, suddenly changing his mind, went to the balcony.  It was getting dark outside, the sky overcast with clouds was even closer to the darkness of the night.  After a couple of minutes and considering that he was breathing enough, Andrei dialed the chief's phone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Valar Morgulis!  - rang in the tube. <br>  - Valar dohaeris. <br>  - Andrei, you are a scoundrel!  Already looked, or what? <br>  - No, I did not look.  All day, like a good boy, I took out the project documentation.  I am calling you to inform you that a couple of minor edits were not worth all this work.  But now it's over, and I'm going to retire.  And before you turn off the phone and dive into viewing the new series, I ask: what have we forgotten yet? <br>  ‚ÄúThey have not forgotten anything, but I wanted to ask you about something.‚Äù  Here we consulted with the contractor and decided that it would be nice to invite a priest to the opening.  And maybe on the tab of the first stone.  It is now common practice ... <br>  - I understand.  It would be nice to sprinkle the project itself, ‚Äùadded Andrey sarcastically. <br>  - So I decided to ask you.  Come in, be kind, to the church, you are close there, talk to the priest to conduct the ceremony, and may they at the same time designate the price.  And we will immediately include it in the estimate, so that later we don‚Äôt pay out of pocket. <br>  - Okay, tomorrow I will come in before work.  If that's all, then I disconnect. <br>  ‚ÄúUntil tomorrow,‚Äù said the chief, and, as usual, he was the first to hang up.

      Andrei Valerievich, he put the phone in his trouser pocket and, looking a little more at the golden dome of the Church of the Most Holy Theotokos, which was visible above the roofs of the neighboring buildings at a distance of an arbalest shot, he resolutely headed for the TV. <br><br>  A puddle crawled along the baseboard, threatening to leak under the linoleum and cause angering neighbors from the bottom.  Larisa Ivanovna collected water with a towel and squeezed it into a bucket.  Apparently, a considerable part of it was behind the culprit of emergency - a two-chamber Samsung refrigerator, and, therefore, was out of reach.  ‚ÄúHere is an infection,‚Äù thought Larisa, wielding a towel.  - Why do these things never break during working hours?  Why now, when shops and workshops are already closed?  However, he probably broke in the morning, I just noticed it only now, and only because it came in a puddle, - she corrected her line of reasoning.  - But it is not important.  What could possibly happen to him?  Freon over? ‚Äù <br><br>  She gently tapped the fridge on the freezer door.  Then, thinking, hit her fist.  Samsung was silent and hung with magnetics brought from Sharm el-Sheikh, reminiscent of the pharaoh's sarcophagus.  ‚ÄúTomorrow in the morning you will need to call the master.  And now it is necessary to take emergency measures.  To finish the stew at least.  And the freezer! ‚ÄùShe opened the door and set the empty pan under the vigorous drops.  Water had to be collected again.  Having finished with this and having finished the stew, she washed the dishes and took out a pile of notebooks.  The evening promised to be long: it was necessary to check the laboratory work of five 9th grades for the ability to identify gametes and genotypes of the offspring.  She managed to check part of the work at school, but still the pile remained impressive.  It would be much more convenient to conduct checklists sequentially, rather than on the same day, but the children created the operational channel ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù, and the answers to the same type of tasks appeared there almost instantly.  In addition, it was necessary to approach the test with an eye on the Internet, pre-checking questions and tasks on search queries, which did not simplify the work of the teaching staff.  The sense of control in the era of the Internet gradually transformed from the possession of material to the ownership of technology, and, as a result, the quality of the answers of the child writing it was very different from the answers of the same child at the blackboard.  ‚ÄúAnd ask them what great houses participated in the Battle of Blackwater, they will answer without hesitation.  However, perhaps this is not the case or not only this.  A generation that grew up without the Internet is terribly afraid of GMOs and believes that the tomato from the supermarket is crossed with a rat - then she looked at the refrigerator door, hung with magnets with images of Egyptian gods, from one of which she winked at the holographic Anubis.  ‚ÄúAnd if we allow for the existence of a rat-tomato, then the jackal-man becomes something taken for granted.‚Äù <br><br>  Returning home from the ecological supermarket, Alevtina Aleksandrovna immediately turned on the computer.  After making sure that the BTC and LTC courses have not changed much, and, therefore, her intervention is not required, she went to the kitchen to make out the food bags, make a fortified cocktail, and figure out what to take with you on the journey tomorrow.  Alevtina planned to visit the old woman Afrosyu not the first week, but the dances of the main cryptocurrency kept her within the guaranteed Internet access.  BitMakler is far from Forex (with which there were problems too), and now the rates were too high, so being out of reach of the network even for a few hours meant an unjustified risk.  She, of course, will take with her both a tablet and a mobile phone, but Afrosya lives in such a hellish wilderness that they most likely will not work there.  Almost everyone warned about this on the forum.  In terms of marketing, this, of course, was the right move.  Not to face grandmother-whisperers live in cities.  They are supposed to walk in black shawls, brown woolen dresses, forbid themselves to take photographs and dwell in rickety huts.  Even if they willingly accept ‚Äúgifts‚Äù in Bitcoins for a visit.  Magic and technology intertwined in accordance with the third law of Clark, which states that any sufficiently developed technology is indistinguishable from magic. <br><br>  Suppose, Alevtina reflected, I imagine how the exchange works, but at the same time I cannot imagine how Bitcoin works;  a person who understands how cryptocurrencies are structured has very vague ideas, for example, about astronomy, and so on.  As a result, despite the fact that together we are the bearers of very specific scientific knowledge, each of us individually is in the new Middle Ages. <br>  So.  The ‚Äústop-loss‚Äù function is configured.  There are products, dress, sneakers, sunglasses, sunblock ... Everything has been packed since yesterday.  She looked into the planner.  It remains to throw everything in the trunk, and tomorrow morning you can go.  On the way, you will still need to go to the church and buy a dozen candles for the ceremony.  Picking up an ipod and downloading googlemaps, Alevtina paved the way from the garage to the Afrosya hut.  After a short reflection, she added to the route the Church of the Most Holy Theotokos, which was nearby.  So.  Now you need to go to the church site, check the work schedule and you can relax.  A few minutes later she sat in a chair and went to the World of Warcraft tab. <br><br>  The exhaust hood was buzzing today somehow especially sadly.  Martin Alekseevich carefully poured the contents of the centrifuge into bottles, sealed it, washed the centrifuge itself and the tools, and wiped everything with a paper napkin.  The work could be considered finished when all the remains of hydrazine disappeared into the sewage system.  Only after that he took off his gas mask, rubber gloves and turned off the ventilation.  Still later, he made six full liter bottles in a container and put it in the fridge.  Leaving the laboratory and locking it, he climbed the stairs to the residential part of his mansion.  From behind the living room door came the sound of swords, then there came the death cry and the neigh of a horse that had lost its rider.  Martin Alekseevich turned the door knob and entered.  The dog was sitting on a chair, stretched out along the string, and seemed to be waiting for his appearance.  The left half of his face was disfigured by a burn scar left over from the time of the first Chechen campaign, where he served as a tank crew.  The dog almost instantly stopped viewing and, turning, cast a questioning glance at him. <br><br>  ‚ÄúEverything is ready,‚Äù said Martin Alekseevich.  - Let him stand for another two hours in the fridge, after that you can take it.  But keep in mind: astrolite G - perishable goods.  After 5 days, the warranty is removed.  - He smiled wryly. <br>  - Here, thanks.  Term X - tomorrow, 4 days guarantee I can return as a bonus, - the Dog joked.  - We will check? <br>  - Of course.  But later.  In the meantime, tell me why the church was chosen as an object this time? <br>  - It's simple.  Yellow Dvija says that breaking the wheel of samsara and thereby freeing sinners can be anywhere, it is enough to do it suddenly and quickly enough.  But why not think of a fallback?  In most religions, a believer killed during prayer automatically falls into his version of paradise.  So why not play it safe?  And besides, do not show respect for the lost?  This time.  Well, two - the crowd and the density of the crowd plus a closed space facilitate the task and enhance the effect. <br>  - It is logical, - said Martin Alekseevich. <br>  ‚ÄúAre you familiar with formal logic?‚Äù  - asked the Dog. <br>  Martin Alekseevich shook his head. <br>  - Not.  My head is busy with other things.  She is like the very attic that the famous detective was talking about, in which everyone tries to drag in more trash.  But I try not to do that.  Maybe my toolkit is simple, but it is in perfect order.  My business is chemistry, brother. <br>  - I like this approach, Professor.  Therefore, I will not ship you with unnecessary details.  Did you say two more hours? <br>  - Yes.  - Martin Alekseevich moved the second chair and, turning it back to the screen, sat on it with its back, putting its hands on the back and resting its chin on them.  - What did you watch?  Last season? <br>  - Yes, there are still a couple of episodes.  - The dog sat on the chair again and pressed the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button.  ‚ÄúJust two hours ...‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373371/</a></p>
