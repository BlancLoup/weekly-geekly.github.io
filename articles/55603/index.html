  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RightSignature or correct online document signatures</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="http://abrdev.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/logo1.png" alt="logo1" width="271" height="90">  Electronic document management and other joys of electronic life have been discussed for more than a decade, starting with the invention of the computer in general.  But ‚Äúthings are still there‚Äù, because despite the ease and availability of sending documents by mail, editing and viewing online in the browser, the final act of the life of many documents consists of a banal printout and then walking around the departments with signatures and seals.  But wait, there are electronic digital signatures, even legislative documents regulating their turnover.  There is something there, but compare it - a document with a sweeping signature of Himself and the usual set of numbers and letters ... somehow it is not that, right? <br><br>  There are also quite a few solutions for workflow, including systems integrated with digital signatures, on the market, both independent and components of other systems, CRM, accounting, etc.  But online, this boom was somehow dubbed, although more and more companies are using virtual offices or even completely online communication of all employees.  So the demand for online document management systems should be.  And should be satisfied.  That's <a href="https://rightsignature.com/"><strong>what the startup RightSignature is about</strong></a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  They took and optimized the very last stage of the life of the document - its approval and signing by all participants and preparation for printing.  At the same time, the off-line section is not forgotten either - the document can be printed without losing touch with its digital copy.  How?  I'll tell you now. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And so, the RightSignature service works with any documents (in digital form) that you download in PDF or MS Word format.  The following are the addresses of people whose signatures must be collected for document approval.  These people will be sent a notification and a special secret link to work with the document in the service interface.  By the way, it is possible to form both a closed list, when the participants do not know each other, and a public one - everyone will immediately see who signed the document and when. <br><br>  The document can be viewed, for this there is a nice and very simple viewer that allows you to scroll back and forth and change the scale of the document, as well as go directly to the page with captions.  Before signing, the document will require confirmation of familiarization so that you still read what you are signing. <br><br>  But in fact in the mechanism of signatures and collected the whole essence of a startup.  Signing a document is offered with a handwritten signature, which you draw in a special window directly on the site (using a mouse or touchpad, or even better - with a tablet, which even the simplest genius for a dozen dollars will fit). You can also identify your identity with a photo or image webcams.  Or, if you have an iPhone, you can use its touch screen, which is much more convenient.  Of course, the signature displayed in this way will not be immediately quite similar to the natural one - it‚Äôs still difficult to do the mouse, you need to practice it several times, since it is possible to expand the input window to the full screen and erase bad signatures.  Well, or to achieve a complete identity, confirm your signature by fax.  The caption honestly warns us that an online signature may not look like the real one, but is nonetheless completely legal and legal.  This is a big plus of the service, which asserts that the signed documents are completely legal and have legal force in accordance with European and American legislation.  For an example, here‚Äôs a quote from the description: "The <em>Unified Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), and the European Directive (EC / 1999/93)" ).</em> ". <br><br>  If you enter your photo, it will be placed opposite your signature, along with other information such as signing time, IP address and other data. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://abrdev.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/document_complete.gif" alt="document_complete" width="578" height="528"></div><br><br>  After the signing is completed, you can download both the original document and its signed copy, which can be printed.  And here lies another nuance of the service - on that very additional page, on which all the signatures are collected, a two-dimensional bar code is being formed at the bottom (now this technology is gaining popularity), having photographed or recognized it with any other device that can go to the website and verify the identity this copy.  In fact, by pointing a mobile phone at such a label, and by contacting the site, you can get the necessary information about the document and check it (although, of course, this moment requires additional tools, in particular, I would expand the capabilities of the service by forming a signature barcode all participants and the possibility of their validation). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="howtosign" src="http://abrdev.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/howtosign.png" alt="howtosign" width="306" height="410"></div><br><br>  Each registered participant has an account page that lists all the documents that are waiting for a signature or have already been signed, as well as the ability to create new documents.  Of the available features, there is integration with Google Docs.  But this is more true for free accounts, where it is allowed to work with five documents per month.  For more advanced versions, and more paid (from $ 11 to $ 99 per month), it is possible to maintain a library of sample documents and merge a group of persons under one account (for example, one for the entire management department). <br><br>  The service itself is quite interesting, especially if it is true that the documents created in this way are legally valid.  The idea is simple and strange that it was not implemented before - although attempts were made in one form or another, even with us (I remember one of my acquaintances was doing a project under the working title ‚ÄúRobarius‚Äù, and I myself participated in prototyping a similar project for the publishing industry WebMoney has a similar service for working with documents), but no one seems to have come to the use of not just a digital signature, but rather a handwritten one written on the screen.  And the distribution of touchscreens and other similar input tools will only expand the capabilities of such a service.  I wonder if such a project is possible in the realities of Russia / Ukraine? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/55603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/55603/</a></p>
