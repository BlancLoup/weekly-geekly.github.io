I bought scales in early 2014 for about 5 thousand rubles in one of the online stores in Moscow.  The need was dictated by the control of the change in the weight of his wife, we were waiting for the completion of the family. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A cursory analysis of the market showed the presence of some nameless models from China, or nondescript models, without frills.  This model Aria bribed its advancement in the form of Wi-Fi and design: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/252/46a/f82/25246af821ee0d56462277757d8981a6.png" alt="image">

      Well, to be honest, I have a Fitbit Force fitness bracelet (now out of production), which can be combined into one ecosystem through a mobile application or a branded dashboard on the Internet. <br><br>  Box: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/829/9a7/d31/8299a7d3183026449e9d0aede6f3e224.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nothing special, except that when they were carrying it, people on the subway could not understand that it was painted and there was a reflection on their faces. <br><br>  Inside instruction, four batteries 1,5V AA.  Made very high quality.  The indicator display looks very good both in the daytime and in the evening.  The application starts, synchronization and scales are ready to use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/539/9e6/ca1/5399e6ca1a7937cff8af5573b7e5afe9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here I will make a small digression. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/291/b5c/668/291b5c6686e894bf006d7a773014a095.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A big surprise was waiting for me, a sticker was attached to the surface of the scales warning that pregnant women should not be used.  But for this purpose the gadget was bought!  This, it turns out, was due to the fact that measurements are made in the following way: by stepping with bare legs, a certain electrical impulse is sent, after analyzing which data on the body fat content are displayed.  Correspondence with the American support did not give anything, the answer came down to the fact that you go to the doctor and he will say how harmful this impulse is.  Arguments about what, if weighed in rubber slippers, did not lead to anything, it was very difficult, apparently, for the respondent.  As a result, the wife was weighed in ordinary slippers with a polyurethane sole and this had no effect on the health of the child. <br><br>  Measurements occur literally within 10 seconds.  The weight, the percentage of fat and the first three letters of the weighed are consistently displayed, the scales are understood by up to 8 different people.  For this, of course, you need to make the appropriate settings.  Scales write ‚ÄúGuest‚Äù as a creeping line if it is some kind of unplanned friend or relative.  The data is automatically transferred via wi-fay via your profile to fitbit.com, then on it, or via a mobile application, it is convenient to view all graphs: weight dynamics, bmi (body mass index), lean &amp; fat (fat and muscles), and more .  Made nice, and most importantly - informative and convenient.  Schedule of the wife, for the sake of which actually was started: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab4/85b/b97/ab485bb9713a1cc9d2dcce8f73f7a13f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  My: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c6/5d7/2b5/9c65d72b54a527379e3619b492386925.png" alt="image"><br><br>  My fat and muscle mass (bones): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/97a/f78/98e/97af7898e07c8166221f29c5f704a3a8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  My BMI is still normal (green zone): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd3/b39/e24/bd3b39e241fdbed55cb1a73887e4c582.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I do not consciously delve into the technical characteristics of the scales, this is not so important compared to how comfortably they perform their functions. <br><br>  I remembered only one minus, during the initial setup, at the wrong time I pressed the button on the computer or something else.  I could not understand how to return to the factory settings of the scales.  It turned out - just like on the router.  It is necessary to find a small hole on the scales from the back side (approximately in square B2, according to the terminology of ‚ÄúSea Battle‚Äù) when turned on, press there with a paper clip or needle for a few seconds. <br><br>  Scales can automatically or manually post a user's weight on Facebook or Twitter. <br><br>  And finally, a few tricks.  How to weigh a child?  I got up first myself, then with a child in my arms (not naked, do not forget about the electrical impulse), the difference is easy to calculate.  The cat's weight was measured in the same way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/69c/ec9/2c8/69cec92c8be2c449382bfd783f3d1d25.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362555/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362555/</a></p>
