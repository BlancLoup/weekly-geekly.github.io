  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Roskomnadzor plans to fine Facebook for non-compliance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today Roskomnadzor drew up a protocol on administrative violations against Facebook.  The social network did not provide the department with the necessary information about the localization of personal data bases of Russian users in Russia, as <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2019/02/28/795383-roskomnadzor-facebook">reported</a> by Vedomosti. <br><br>  Even on December 17, 2018, Roskomnadzor sent Facebook a request demanding to provide the information required by law about the transfer of Russians to the server, which are stored in Russia.  The answer was never received. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúOn February 28, 2019, the Office of Roskomnadzor for the Central Federal District drafted an administrative offense report against Facebook.  The protocol was drawn up under article 19.7 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation due to the fact that the company did not provide the necessary information about the localization of personal data bases of Russian users in Russia, ‚Äùthe agency‚Äôs website <a href="https://rkn.gov.ru/news/rsoc/news65764.htm">reports</a> . <br><br>  The decision to impose a fine will take the magistrate, who has already sent documents.  This was announced by Roskomnadzor.  The penalty for this article of the Code of Administrative Offenses is about 5,000 rubles.

      About a week ago, Roskomnadzor announced the drafting of exactly the same protocol regarding Twitter.  Social networks received letters demanding to provide information on the localization of data of Russian citizens.  Letters arrived simultaneously. <br><br>  As for the answers, they, according to Roskomnadzor, were received in January 2019 - however, they do not contain controversial information on the actual implementation of the legislation, there is no mention of the deadlines for compliance with the norms.  A spokesman for Roskomnadzor said that Twitter promised to complete the transfer of data from Russian users to Russia by the summer of last year.  But so far this has not happened.  ‚ÄúAll this time we have been in dialogue and correspondence with Twitter,‚Äù said Vadim Ampelonsky. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe companies that manage Facebook and Twitter social networks provided formal answers to our demands to confirm the localization of the personal data bases of Russian users in Russia.  They do not contain specifics about the actual implementation of the legislation at the moment, nor about the timing of the implementation of these standards in the future &lt;...&gt; In this regard, Roskomnadzor begins administrative proceedings against both companies, ‚Äùthe ministry‚Äôs press service said. <br><br>  The law on the storage of personal data entered into force on September 1, 2015.  According to it, companies must store and process data from Russians in Russia.  The social network LinkedIn, which refused to comply with these requirements, was entered in the register of violators of the law in November 2016.  Access to the network site in Russia is blocked. <br><br>  In April 2018, the head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov, said that the service plans to verify compliance with the law by Facebook.  If it turns out that the law is not being implemented, then Roskomnadzor was going to raise the issue of blocking the social network. <br><br>  By the way, Facebook was rumored to have <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/408043/">opened a</a> representative office in Russia back in 2017, for which she was looking for a regional representative.  The company has not one headquarters, more than 30 international offices work outside the United States, but so far there has not been a Russian office.  At that time, the possibility of opening a local office was connected with the fact that Facebook would enter into a dialogue with government agencies, submit to the requirements of the law, and still transfer servers to Russia. <br><br>  For non-compliance with the requirement a penalty of up to 500 thousand rubles.  Repeated violation leads to the blocking of violators on the territory of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe law is mandatory for all.  In any case, we will either ensure that the law is enforced or the company stops working in the territory of the Russian Federation, as unfortunately happened to LinkedIn.  There are no exceptions ... We will ensure that Facebook‚Äôs 242nd law is respected.  In 2018, everything will be fine ... We are well aware that Facebook has a significant number of users in the Russian Federation, on the other hand, we understand that this is not a unique service, there are other social networks, ‚Äùsaid Zharov in 2018. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442164/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442164/</a></p>
