The cost of the book is $ 4, and now the teacher faces 2 years in prison, forced labor, or a fine.  The site itself was created by a teacher for poor students who are unable to obtain the necessary data for their studies due to lack of funds for textbooks / other literature.  Ironically, earlier the same teacher received praise from representatives of the Ministry of Education of Latvia for their work. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Generally speaking, pirated copies of the books of ‚Äúpersecution,‚Äù that is, attempts to punish distributors of such publications, began relatively recently.  For music / movies / software / games distributed illegally, has been punished for a long time.  But for the book, or rather, their pirated electronic copies, they began to punish really recently.

      On its website, PƒÅvels Jurs, that is the name of the teacher, published presentations, lessons, in general, educational materials.  Of course, when PƒÅvels Jurs was about to leave home for work, and he was arrested, the teacher was incredibly surprised.  During the arrest, the police also confiscated a computer to check for pirated copies of the textbook ‚ÄúVƒìsture Vidusskolai‚Äù.  The police acted not on their own initiative, but after filing a complaint with the publisher Zvaigzne ABC and the subsequent actions of the bodies that supervise the "pirates". <br><br>  A little later, it turned out that earlier the author of the book had already asked the teacher to remove some materials from the site, but there was a misunderstanding, which led to current events (as far as can be understood, the teacher simply did not understand what the author of the book wanted to remove). <br><br>  PƒÅvels Jurs claims that he did not receive any profit from his website, and expresses sincere bewilderment about the ways in which the publisher tries to defend his interests.  Judge for yourself: the site is currently not working (disabled), the teacher‚Äôs computer has been confiscated, and he himself can either go to jail or be fined a considerable amount. <br><br>  However, after the arrest, the representatives of the publishing company have already met with the "criminal", and it seems like a certain agreement was reached.  Probably, the conflict will still be settled peacefully, but there is no certainty yet. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/police-raid-school-teacher-for-uploading-history-book-for-students-130520/">torrentfreak</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180595/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180595/</a></p>
