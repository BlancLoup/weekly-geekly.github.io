  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Explanatory head phraseological dictionary - with explanations</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Read the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195976/">article</a> .  The article is interesting, but I think that for each situation there are different realities.  And since I have leadership experience both in the field of development and in the field of company management, I would like to comment on some phrases from this dictionary, so to speak, passing them through the prism of a more extensive opinion than the opinion of the development manager.  And the point here is not that software development is a specific thing - on the contrary, any manager, in my opinion, should consider the situation from all sides and then decide to use a specific phrase or not.  Let's start: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>"Everything is bad!</i>  <i>Need to do faster!</i>  <i>It is necessary to do better! ‚Äù</i> - it can mean that there is a lot of work, the team works with all its might, and the boss keeps up the pace;  and the fact that there are 2 orders for 3 days and the team is incompetent and pulls them for a couple of weeks. <br>  <i>‚ÄúWe have no irreplaceable ones!‚Äù</i> - this is the phrase: a) a manager in a large company, where + - a couple of people do not decide absolutely nothing.  b) Phase of a manager who is ready to sacrifice a specialist to whom he says it - for if you say that, then subconsciously you are ready to part with such an employee, and this is also a beacon for the employee - because a good specialist will not be told this - it is very difficult to look for employees - far more difficult than to look for a job, especially with some specifics and with the ready organization of production.  It is much more difficult and expensive to train another such ram than to leave the one who already knows how it all is, but in principle such people are really interchangeable without any special problems.  From the employee‚Äôs side, a good specialist will immediately hear this or say that he‚Äôs leaving - then, depending on circumstances - for example, he will ask for much more wages - and the employer will most likely agree, and mediocre workers will just be silent and sit on so as not to lose a warm place. <br>  <i>‚ÄúAfter the project, only the best will remain!‚Äù</i> - well, how would it be if the project goes for 3 months and during these 3 months the manager sees that Vasya and Petya do not do anything at all and work under the lash - then why are they needed in the team?  From the point of view of a competent employee, this phrase will not change anything at all - for it includes the definition of the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and this phrase is deeply parallel to it. <br>  <i>‚ÄúYou are responsible for everything!‚Äù</i> - for everything that you are entitled to according to your duties.  Do not forget that most often people complain that they were flooded with work not because they were given more work, but because they do not cope well and work is accumulated - here the analogy with the institute - you do nothing during the semester - at the end of the semester - ‚Äúit is overthrown‚Äù, and those who do everything on time - just calmly pass and do not soar. <br>  <i>‚ÄúThinking is my job!</i>  <i>Just do as I said! ‚Äù</i> - in general and in general - the phrase is bad, because creativity and initiative from employees is the key to good work.  But when the deadlines are on, you just need to take 2 and multiply by 2, while receiving four, and the subordinate says - ‚ÄúI thought here, if we take the Leibniz formula, find the value of a variable by it, then take the derivative of the function in which this value reaches maximum and integrating, in pairs decompose into members, which then multiply by 27.875, add, then we more gracefully get four, well ... not quite four, but there will be 4,0007897 - well, almost four! ‚Äù- then the phrase‚Äú YOU, multiply two by two, do not reinvent the wheel! ‚Äùfits in perfectly.  And this is just a modified phrase ‚ÄúJust do as I said.‚Äù <br>  <i>‚ÄúDo what you are entrusted with and don‚Äôt bother yourself!‚Äù</i> - there is such a thing as a hierarchy, and the company's working mechanism works well when every part of it works well.  There is an accountant who is perfectly able to reduce debit with a loan - and there is a cleaning lady Klavdiya Vasilyevna - and an accountant can tell Klavdiya Vasilyevna that she didn‚Äôt clean the office well, but Klavdia Vasilyevna better not tell the accountant how to calculate pension accruals. <br>  Well, and so on. <br>  The words ‚Äúmediocre,‚Äù ‚Äúbad,‚Äù ‚Äúnothing,‚Äù and some others, fell into place with the more precise, but less censorous words that were originally present in this post. <br>  From myself I would like to add - in my opinion, a good leader should understand that these phrases can be interpreted in different ways - once they need to be spoken, because not only managers are different, but employees too.  The original <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195976/">article</a> is a kind of ‚Äúideal gas‚Äù or ‚Äúabsolutely black body‚Äù - in terms of the fact that for its fairness it is necessary that all, absolutely all members of the team, be highly qualified specialists who are 100% efficient and able to do their job.  But this, alas, does not happen. <br>  Let me explain - this is not quite a criticism, since the whole article is fertile - and the leaders still need to take care of themselves and their expressions.  But on the other hand, the head should not be appointed for beautiful eyes - for me, the ‚ÄúHead‚Äù is a person who knows more about the project and is able to fulfill it better than anyone, if he could do it technically. <br>  Thanks for attention. </div>
