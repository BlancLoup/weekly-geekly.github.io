Of course, if our adult is not an FBI agent who loves three-piece suits.  Nevertheless, science comes to the rescue and in such a delicate matter as the search for the dark forces of evil.  Our selection of Halloween gadgets come in handy if you are strong, dexterous, skillful, and if you are ready to join the league of good and justice.  And with the help of the devices presented in the post, you can once and for all identify ghosts, babaek, poltergeist and Cthulhu. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, not much is needed to detect ectoplasmic entities: a <s>proton unit</s> , an electromagnetic field meter, a pair of sensitive microphones, a radio frequency scanner with the ability to record ether, a thermometer, and a barometer.  Such devices in the combination of "all-in-love" quite a long time excite the minds of various inventors.  Some decide to bring fantasies to life by raising money for a real prototype.  Just such a device with a worried look can be taken out of your pocket, turned on an ominously flashing light bulb and loudly declared: ‚ÄúEveryone keep calm!  Paranormal activity detected! ‚Äù

      But we believe that a real researcher should not be afraid of difficulties.  It is better to take ten instruments with you and rely on the result of at least one of them, rather than pointlessly poking at bringing a piece of untested plastic of the next GHOSTBUSTERS startup. <br><br><h1>  Thermal imaging camera </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa9/735/d39/fa9735d397ad4ef5b26267048adfed6b.jpg"><br><br>  There are various options for thermal imagers.  Some of them are quite compatible with conventional smartphones.  For example, the Therm-App is a thermal imaging camera that uses thermal infrared waves emitted by objects and allows you to navigate in the dark, detect the presence of various creatures, detect leaks and heat losses in structures, while photographs and video clips are recorded in the memory of a smartphone. <br><br><h1>  Electromagnetic field meter </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/580/9aa/938/5809aa938e4640ecae0b9f193b57085b.png"><br><br>  The device is designed to detect and control biohazard electromagnetic radiation.  ‚ÄúSpecialists‚Äù in the afterlife claim that spirits are present in the material world in a kind of electromagnetic form.  Accordingly, they can be detected due to changes in the surrounding electromagnetic field (EMF). <br><br>  The fixation of abrupt and short-term jumps of EMFs is almost the main tool for studying parapsychological phenomena. <br><br>  Unfortunately, low-cost household models work in a fairly narrow range of frequencies and are not suitable for ghost hunting. <br><br><h1>  Camera </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60a/222/51a/60a22251af464e45b8658869252371df.jpg"><br><br>  Camera-recorder with the option of night vision.  The camera must respond to movement, so it must be equipped with an appropriate detector.  And one camera here can not do.  Infrared illumination allows you to photograph and record video in complete darkness without night vision devices. <br><br><h1>  Thermometer </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ec/f62/a92/3ecf62a9255f42b5a4cfa83fc274ddb0.jpg"><br><br>  If the room temperature has dropped dramatically, you should know - this is a sign of the presence of spirits (or batteries disconnected in October).  Researchers of the supernatural to determine the ambient temperature usually use infrared electronic thermometers, the principle of which is quite simple - the radiation from the object enters the sensitive element of the thermometer through the optical system. <br><br><h1>  Hygrometer </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e1/7e1/c7f/3e17e1c7f0dc48d8ab872cdca7ffd45e.jpg"><br><br>  Hygrometer - a device for measuring humidity.  Electronic hygrometers can measure humidity in the range from 0 to 100%.  Evil forces, according to beliefs, often affect the weather, and this device will allow you to quickly monitor changes in environmental parameters. <br><br><h1>  Anemometer </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec2/cf4/872/ec2cf4872f2847d19a99f17e233008ee.jpg"><br><br>  It is a device for measuring the speed of movement of gases, air in systems, for example, in ventilation.  In meteorology, it is used to measure wind speed.  Such a device can be <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/256390/">made yourself</a> .  Fluctuations in air are a frequent sign of presence of mind. <br><br><h1>  Aeroion counter </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d92/cd3/a4e/d92cd3a4ebc3494f927bac0dc326c7f1.jpg"><br><br>  This device is designed to measure the concentration of light positive and negative ions to control the levels of air ionization.  It is believed that ghosts emit a large number of positive ions. <br><br><h1>  Soft </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/049/542/157/04954215722446a28c71691c2ae876ef.png"><br><br>  More advanced ghostbusters immediately set themselves Echovox (IOS, Android), SCD-1 (Windows), GhostHunter M2 (IOS, Android) applications.  We will not recommend anything from this list - applications are paid.  However, according to the creators, they contain EMI detectors, audio detectors and tools for searching electronic voice phenomena (searching for the voices of the dead in ‚Äúwhite noise‚Äù).  In general, if you are a mobile developer, take a closer look at this niche.  You may be able to do something new for parapsychology! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cc/646/f46/4cc646f467ff4f1a8abfe6f38db0bc60.jpg"><br><br>  Another paid application is GhostRadar: Legacy.  It uses the phone‚Äôs sensors to measure electromagnetic fields and vibrations around you, and then uses a proprietary algorithm to process the data and use it to measure quantum fluctuations ‚Äî changes in the amount of energy around you.  How it works is completely incomprehensible, but, judging by the design, the developers clearly have something to strive for. <br><br>  The total cost of all the above devices and software can pass for several thousand euros, so they have to warn you: this search for adrenaline is not a budget solution.  Going to a movie on a horror movie can be no less fascinating and a much more affordable way to spend Halloween.  The search for ghosts remains extremely fascinating, although completely useless. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368839/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368839/</a></p>
