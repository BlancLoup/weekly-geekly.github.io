All the ancient civilizations that left their mark on the culture knew this.  Simple shapes form the basis of the geometry of the universe.  People invented a lot of things, but we did not come up with simple forms.  We discovered them by observing nature.  Understanding the basic forms and their functions has taught us orientation in space and time, inspired by mathematics, technology, languages ‚Äã‚Äãand evolution. <br><blockquote>  The universe cannot be read until we learn the language in which it is written.  It is written in the language of mathematics, and its letters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures, without which a person is not able to understand a single word. <br>  - Galileo Galilei </blockquote><br><h4>  Geometric tools </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f69/5b7/832/f695b783256c060dc81a6134a3edffe8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A set of simple forms was used in the art of all cultures: a circle, intersecting lines, a triangle, a square and a spiral.  Cultural anthropologist Ange Arjen studied and wrote down the general features of the arts for several decades, and found repetitive forms used in all forms of art.  She called them "five universal forms."

The circle rolls freely, the lines travel and intersect, the triangle stands firmly and points away, the quadrilateral is inevitably stable, the spiral twists with elegant perseverance.  Do not let simplicity forms fool yourself.  They are so simple, and that is why they are scaled and used as building blocks that make up nature and the world created by human hands.  And they serve to transmit messages in logos. <br><br><h4>  A bit of geometry </h4><br>  The purpose of the logo is to convey something to the customer in the simplest but most comprehensive way.  Simple forms tell about the main properties of the organization in a direct way, and are used in all types of design - graphic, interior, landscape, grocery, industrial and architectural. <br><blockquote>  For me, no children's experience has brought such confidence in their own research capabilities, like geometry. <br>  - Richard Buckminster Fuller </blockquote><br>  Our feelings process a huge amount of information.  And only a small part of it is noticed by consciousness, since the brain cannot process the endless stream generated by the outside world.  Because of the amount of information, most of it is absorbed subconsciously. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Digital technology has taken away our tactile sensations.  But touches have played an important role in the knowledge of the world throughout history.  Traditional drawing tools keep us in touch with the tangible world.  Therefore, sometimes draw, spend time in nature without a particular goal, experiment with geometry manually, so that your designs are multifaceted in essence and elegant in appearance.  As geometry informs the truth about the universe and how it works, so a designer who understands the work of basic forms can impart an elusive and at the same time lasting enhancement to the logo so that it can better convey its message. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f73/1ab/455/f731ab455314c77b038fa1ff55783e3a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The basic tools of the geometer are as simple as the forms they create.  Compass, pencil and ruler - everything you need to create various geometric shapes. <br><br>  Forms describe functions that do not change depending on their scale.  In addition, the order of constructing forms is similar to the order of multidimensional space.  Zero, one, two, three and four dimensions are also known as degrees of freedom.  Degrees of freedom express a gradual increase in independence from the lower ones in higher dimensions, starting with the zero dimension, which corresponds to a circle. <br><br><h4>  Circle: zero measurement </h4><br>  Geometry begins with the center, the source of the whole circle.  A simple point is also a zero dimension.  In the physical sense, a point denotes a place in space, so it has no freedoms - or zero degrees of freedom.  The starting point at which we put the compass gives rise to a circle, which is a form that is independent enough to constantly roll and spin in the physical world.  It has no restrictions of angular forms (although the corners have their own functions). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8b/4e0/4dc/f8b4e04dc59a4a14c6986a93ee51c6be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The circle is the mother of all figures, since it is the archetype from which the rest of the geometry is drawn.  In nature, everything is the same: life begins in the form of a single cell or seed.  The basic principle of the circle is a container that protects, supports and gives life.  It allows it to scale from miniature organisms and cells to the size of a planet that supports different types of life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec3/8b2/45d/ec38b245d7c2175588f3ce959a045aef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In geometry, a circle begins as a simple point, surrounded by an infinite number of points united in a circle.  As the fertilized egg contains everything necessary for the creation of a living organism, so the circle contains all possibilities. <br><br>  In logos, a circle means many parts or individualities that form something whole.  The circle represents uniting groups - collectives, non-profit, global organizations and government agencies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11d/62e/781/11d62e7817814725d1e5d1c1670cfd6d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Logos: The Dallas Opera, PBS and AgriCultura</i> <br><br>  The Dallas Opera, PBS and AgriCultura are examples of circular patterns used in logos to convey basic customer information.  The ‚ÄúO‚Äù in the Dallas Opera logo represents one of the two uppercase letters in the title and at the same time constitutes a covering pattern representing the diverse group of musicians making up the organization.  Logo style emphasizes grace and sweat music.  The circle surrounding PBS covers the entire demographic group (which is indicated by repeating images of the head) for which the company's broadcast is intended.  And the hand and the sheet, representing the network of farmers who make up AgriCultura, are included in the circle describing their single goal. <br><br><h4>  Line: one dimension </h4><br>  The egg must divide to become a multicellular organism, and the circle must be cloned to create the next geometric shape.  Placing the compass needle on the outer edge of the circle and drawing a second circle of the same diameter, we copy the first one.  We will have the opportunity to connect their two centers together and push the point to the line.  The line can move only in one direction, forward or backward, and therefore it has only one degree of freedom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/420/6e3/8fc/4206e38fc8fdfc0daf446bc260292d8b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And at the intersection of two circles, another form is born.  The second line connects the overlapping circles and intersects with the first at an angle of 90 ¬∞.  When two opposites connect, they create a connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/282/1e1/3b3/2821e13b3d30748c7b7219b8a765f309.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Elements that intersect at right angles represent opposites that work together in logos.  The power of symbolism extends this concept, and this configuration can be useful for representing unification or joint efforts between two different goals. <br><br>  The intersecting lines in the logo of Heart Hospital of New Mexico support its goal, which is to treat patients balancing between life and death, and complements the more specific messages conveyed by the design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/087/d3e/0d4/087d3e0d43166eece4595a71d10c0526.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Historically, hospitals have used intersecting lines as the basis of the logo.  At the character level, these institutions are at the intersection of life and death.  I used the historic Sun symbol used by the Zia Indians, which is depicted on the flag of New Mexico, and added a heart and a hand to complete the concept of the hospital. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomplementary opposites can also be conveyed by the almond-shaped core of two overlapping circles.  This form is called vesica piscis (fish bubble) or mandorla, and is a by-product of the geometric process that is used to build a connection between two points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/196/c5b/b1e/196c5bb1eb4373d1bd30f85a7706cd12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Triangle: two dimensions </h4><br>  Once the point has turned into a line, you can take the next step by building a triangle.  Two degrees of freedom is much more than one.  A closed flat space allows you to move along two axes inside you, and not just forward and backward. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a8/c6e/a8b/0a8c6ea8bb94637609e35f6eec0882fb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A triangle is a safe piece when it stands on the ground or is combined with upturned copies.  It is often used as the basis of structural support in buildings and bridges, or as part of a curb in art.  It is a form of geodesic domes, trusses of bridges, arched doorways (a triangle with an arch above), and also a form of a pelvic bone that allows people to walk on two legs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2a/63b/096/f2a63b096609c8fe02625affc6dac069.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The triangle translates a solid foundation to a point.  From a philosophical point of view, he stands firmly on the ground and points to something invisible.  It is clear why the triangle is used as an arrow - it leads from one thing towards another.  Because of this, the triangle is often used as a symbol of inspiration or aspiration.  The top of the mountain is a metaphor for inspiration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75e/883/976/75e883976118e19d56283975e8455210.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Recycling - action in three parts.  Coming into the world, existence, and then folding for any next purpose.  Simply put, the triangle is a metaphor for birth, life and death, or the beginning, middle and end.  The recycle symbol expresses this sequence in the simplest way - by triangular arrows covering the three parts of the triangle. <br><br>  Also, a triangle is a symbol of transformation, a mediator between one-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces.  All words starting with tri- or trans- (‚Äúthrough‚Äù in Latin) refer to the strength of the triangle and to the safe space that allows for serious changes or some kind of movement.  Life begins with a zero measurement from a single cell egg.  It then divides and transforms into a multicellular embryo inside a safe pelvis triangle (a metaphor for two dimensions).  After that, it turns into a more complex three-dimensional form.  Then life begins to go - and this is already a metaphor for four dimensions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a3/8be/9b5/8a38be9b5226aec078b4ff52e40917af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The 19th century calligraphy of the Japanese Zen master Sengai Gibon, called the ‚ÄúUniverse‚Äù, literally translates as ‚ÄúCircle, Triangle, Square‚Äù.  The picture shows the universal process of separation and transformation of the whole - the process is read from right to left, as is customary in the traditional Asian style. <br><br>  A triangle embedded in a logo can symbolize a look outside, inspiration, a serious change or movement.  Note that many automakers include a triangle or three elements to describe their products. <br><br>  The triangle at the top of the unfinished pyramid on the dollar bill symbolizes the inspired hope of the new country, security and the transformation of the past into a better future.  The three-legged symbol on the logo of the Ministry of Transport refers us to the ancient symbol Triskelion, which denotes perpetual motion.  The logo also uses a circle, symbolizing the organization responsible for movement in the whole country.  Geometric symbols are simple, so they can be used together, reinforcing the meaning of the logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c4/a97/b4a/5c4a97b4ae532ecb58b21b3053b7306e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Developing a logo for MuSE (Multi-User Synthetic Environment, a multi-user artificial environment), I wanted to show the client‚Äôs goal - to interpret raw data in an understandable visual format.  For example, the surgeon needs to see an MRI scan to get to a brain tumor;  The program must pass many tests in order not to launch a rocket by accident due to a lightning strike. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/629/115/f5a/629115f5ae3153f68e95feaa081735a9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ad/5c7/21a/2ad5c721a91fe5fe6729bef0f01c3dc4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The logo uses mythical Muse.  The triangular shape denotes the transformation of numerical data into something more;  three shadow faces represent the quality of the contours, or depth, visualized in two dimensions. <br><br><h4>  Four-sided figures: three dimensions </h4><br>  Squares and rectangles are the least interesting of all the basic shapes, but they are also useful.  Adding a fourth point, depth, creates a tetrahedron, or pyramid, with the z axis, and takes us into a three-dimensional world.  We use the symbol of the four-sided form to describe the four points of the three-dimensional space, or three degrees of freedom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c56/be2/f46/c56be2f466fe7f4e2b6ac666033860a4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The four-dot shape designates stability.  In nature, it is rarely seen, but in man-made things there are urban areas, parks, squares, buildings, building materials (bricks, tiles), windows, monitors, and paintings within.  Even paper money subconsciously conveys value through form.  Historically, coins were made of precious metals, and their value could be determined by weighing.  The value of paper money fluctuates quite strongly, because it depends on the markets that can be manipulated. <br><br>  The quadrilateral represents the real, real world.  It is rectangular, reinforced and stable.  This form is simple and box-shaped, and the logos that use it indicate that the client is straightforward and straightforward.  Banks, lawyers, insurance and accounting companies, contractors often use this template to make them stable and reliable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f44/22b/90c/f4422b90c544c54a6e826aadcae2143f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  MediaDesk NM provides non-profit organizations with access to communication services so they can concentrate on working with their communities.  The visual elements were suggested by the name media, desk (desk) and New Mexico.  The tables are quadrangular, the shape of the state of New Mexico is similar to a quadrilateral.  Small squares together with large ones symbolize speech and communication.  Also, small boxes denote individual non-profit organizations that contribute to overall stability. <br><br><h4>  The five-pointed star and its related form, a spiral: five degrees of freedom </h4><br>  Five points - the basis for pentagons and five-pointed stars.  Stars represent excellence: five-star restaurants, hotels and flags come to mind, as well as movie stars.  In the human body, the number five occurs several times - five shoots from the body, five fingers for the use of tools, five toes for movement, five basic senses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f13/eeb/cc9/f13eebcc9c378ad916fd96e5e86905af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you have to look for food in nature, remember that fruits grown from five-petalled inflorescences (apricots and pears) or spiral flowers (vitamin C in the rosehip) are usually nutritious.  But six-petal inflorescences are usually poisonous or have a medical use (poison and medicine are the same in different proportions).  Apples, cherries, peaches, pumpkins - all of them have five petals of flowers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0cb/dc8/8f2/0cbdc88f230f1c8ba2dbad1c1c606e17.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since nutrition is extremely important for the body, it is not surprising that the five-pointed star means the best of the best.  Converse and Starbucks are examples of famous logos that use stars as one of the elements to label themselves as the best.  Stars are rarely used in works of culture, but they are strongly associated with spirals, which are much more common. <br><br><h4>  Stars love spirals and spirals love stars </h4><br>  The star can be used as a template for a spiral, one of the universal shapes.  A few turns of the star's triangular shoulders can be scaled to smaller and smaller sizes, and their outlines will draw a spiral.  The ability of this form to rotate and infinitely decrease or increase denotes the principle of regeneration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb2/01a/ae5/eb201aae543e0969b84ee8fec380d3ea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The spiral denotes the cyclical nature of time in space, it constantly repeats and at the same time changes with each turn.  This is the fourth dimension, time and space. <br><br>  In nature, the five-pointed star and the spiral are also intertwined.  They can be seen in the sunflower.  If you look from above, the star can be seen by the way the leaves of the plants grow, and in profile these leaves go around the stem in a spiral.  These two aspects work together to provide the best access to solar energy - so the shadows are minimized, and the flow of rainwater is redirected directly to the roots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75c/2b0/4c6/75c2b04c6018a52bb8e55bf0cfdf25fc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Creative clients and organizations specializing in futurology and creative thinking go well with this form. <br><br>  Swan Songs (swan songs) is a non-profit group of musicians who play for terminally ill people, and I immediately realized that the treble clef could include the shape of a swan.  The client chose a suitable name, and I combined the properties of a swan and music. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dac/d97/aba/dacd97aba0f4bcc1295d7656cafc013d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This logo not only includes the visual characteristics of the organization, but also by means of a spiral indicates infinity - a metaphor for the eternal circle of existence and regeneration of life.  This logo soothes and conveys a positive attitude of its audience, and complements the lack of commercial benefits. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Who would have thought that simple geometry contained such depths and such significance?  It is very effective if you thoughtfully include it in the logo.  Geometrical figures themselves have too many meanings to compose a logo on their own, but their universal values ‚Äã‚Äãcan support the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe logo that it must convey.  Add a combination of symbols, metaphors and natural templates - and your simple and elegant logo will be able to convey a lot of information to its audience, and be able to be stored in memory. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262121/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262121/</a></p>
