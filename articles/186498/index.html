      FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative implementation of PHP FastCGI with several additional features commonly used for heavily loaded sites. <br><br>  These features include: <br><br><ul><li>  advanced process management with a correct (graceful) stop and start procedure; </li><li>  the ability to run vorkerov with different uid / gid / chroot-environment, as well as running on different ports using different php.ini (replacement safe_mode); </li><li>  standard output streams (stdout) and errors (stderr); </li><li>  emergency restart in case of sudden destruction of the opcode cache; </li><li>  support for accelerated upload; </li><li>  ‚ÄúSlowlog‚Äù - logging of unusually slow-running scripts (not only their names, but also their tracing. This is achieved using ptrace and other similar utilities for reading execution data of remote processes); </li><li>  fastcgi_finish_request () is a special function to complete the request and flush all data buffers, and the process can continue to perform any long-term actions (video conversion, statistics processing, etc.); </li><li>  The type of child process launch - dynamic, static and on-demand; </li><li>  Basic information about the status of SAPI (similar to Apache mod_status); </li><li>  A configuration file based on php.ini. </li></ul><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A small wiki for those who do not understand what is happening here: <br><br>  <b>Handler - why do I need it:</b> <br>  In order to run a website in PHP, the server must interpret the PHP code.  It interprets the code based on the PHP library you are using, for example PHP 5. The PHP handler is what actually loads the libraries so that they can be used for interpretation.  PHP handlers determine how PHP is loaded on the server. <br><br>  <b>What PHP handlers are available in cPanel:</b> <br>  There are several different handlers that can be used to load PHP: CGI, DSO, suPHP, and FastCGI.  Each handler uses a different PHP download implementation.  Each implementation affects the performance of the Apache server, because it determines how Apache serves PHP. <br><br>  So what?? <br><br>  List of PHP handlers: <br><br><h4>  DSO (mod_php) </h4><br>  DSO is also known as mod_php.  DSO stands for: Dynamic Shared Object.  It is old, but is generally considered the fastest handler.  It works as an Apache module.  This means that PHP scripts will be executed as an Apache user who is a user: "nobody". <br><br>  DSO has two drawbacks: <br>  Firstly, all files created using the PHP script will have the owner ‚Äúnobody‚Äù.  It will not be available from the Internet.  Sites that need to upload files using PHP may have problems with file permissions.  This is a WordPress problem, uploading files through the WordPress interface or using the automatic update feature will fail with the DSO. <br><br>  The second disadvantage is the security issue.  The files created will have the owner nobody.  If a hacker finds a vulnerability in your PHP script, he could modify or use a file that has the same privileges, important system files, which also belong to nobody. <br><br><h4>  CGI </h4><br>  CGI stands for: Common Gateway Interface.  The CGI handler will handle PHP as a CGI module, unlike the Apache module.  However, if you have suExec, this will allow you to see which user made the request. <br><br>  The CGI method is intended as a fallback when the DSO handler is not available.  According to cPanel‚Äôs own documentation, this method is neither fast nor safe, regardless of whether suExec is enabled or not. <br><br><h4>  suPHP </h4><br>  suPHP is read as Single user PHP.  suPHP also runs PHP as a CGI module, not an Apache module.  It differs from CGI in that PHP scripts that are invoked from the web will run under the user who owns them.  suPHP is usually the default handler and Cpanel is recommended for PHP maintenance. <br><br>  BUT, there is one BUT: <br>  The disadvantage of suPHP is that it creates a much higher load on the processor.  In addition, with suPHP, you cannot use code caching (for example, eAccelerator or APC).  What creates additional load and slows down the processing speed. <br><br>  <b>how could they use it by default with the main handler ??????</b> <br><br><h4>  FCGI </h4><br>  FCGI (otherwise: mod_fcgid) is a high performance update / CGI variant.  It has the advantages of suPHP.  The difference with FCGI is that it can significantly save on processor performance and give speeds close to DSO. <br><br>  The disadvantage of FCGI is (literally): <br>  There is no need for a mod_fcgid case. processes.  This means that using the PHP_fcgid process you need to have many PHP processes. <br><br>  <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi%3Fbug%3D504132">bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504132#25</a> <br><br>  In general terms, the same shit as the previous ones, creates a huge number of separate processes, which, while keeping the cache code separately each in itself, and even die. <br><br>  <b>read and keywords about what you need to implement.</b> <br><br>  real FastCGI mod_fastcgi! = mod_fcgid <br>  <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/node/6">www.fastcgi.com/drupal/node/6</a> <br><br>  php-fpm <br>  <a href="http://php-fpm.org/about/">php-fpm.org/about</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186498/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186498/</a></p>
