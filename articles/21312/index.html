      <em>I‚Äôm surprised why the author of such a wonderful ‚Äúplum‚Äù still gives a hand.</em>  <em>Be that as it may, but in my opinion, it is simply unacceptable to drag out all this dirty laundry to the PARTICIPANT of events.</em> <br><br>  <em>One thing - journalistic investigation "from the side."</em>  <em>This is understandable and interesting.</em> <br><br>  <em>Another thing is the narration on behalf of a person for more than one year independently participating in events.</em>  <em>And the reason for the appearance of this opus, as I understand it, is the usual ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù because of the promised, but undelivered money?</em> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <em>Writing such facts is impossible in my set of ethical rules.</em>  <em>Whatever the situation inside, no matter what happens.</em>  <em>If I am at work right here so badly and uncomfortably, and around there are only thieves and assholes, then I ask myself the question ‚Äúwhat am I doing here?‚Äù.</em>  <em>Where do I have the right to poke a finger at them and hang tags?</em> <em><br></em> <br><br>  <strong>I. Ashmanov</strong> : <em>... Transparency is useful.</em>  <em>Someone has to tell about failures and evil intentions (as well as good ones), mistakes, bungling and so on.</em>  <em>Another useful.</em> <br><br>  <em>About the "revenge" and for the money - you get it wrong.</em>  <em>As I already wrote there, I believe that what we threw there was - I personally went only for the benefit.</em>  <em>And a few hundred thousand dollars would only hurt me then.</em> <br><br>  <em>But.</em>  <em>It is wrong, when a person can deceive quite a lot of people and expect that everything will be closed, and no one will ask questions, it will be possible to dissect them into conferences and build a smooth businessman.</em>  <em>Swindlers need to be called swindlers.</em>  <em>And if then they do not serve hands - this is correct.</em> <br><br>  <em>Probably, the point is that you just "sit" in organizations.</em>  <em>And for you this is a ‚Äúplace of work‚Äù.</em>  <em>And you do not jump off when something does not work out.</em>  <em>The captain, unlike a sailor or a rat, cannot jump into the boat at the exact moment when he is tired.</em> <em><br></em> <br><br>  <em>My advice to you is talk less in public about your own moral principles.</em>  <em>It went, and unconvincing, and suspicious.</em>  <em>If someone shouts loudly, "I'm honest-honest-honest," what would you think of him?</em> <br><br>  The full version here <a href="http://roem.ru/links/5524/%3Fc">http://roem.ru/links/5524/?c#com</a> <br><br>  <strong>Instead of reviewing</strong> <br><br>  The book of I. Ashmanov is one more professional internet ‚Äúbutton accordion‚Äù.  And a discussion of it at the time of publication in print looks like LJ-shny loserism: ‚Äúhedgehog‚Äù -creators studied the manuscript a year ago, when it was posted on the net.  Of course they laughed, they recognized all the characters.  But do not forget.  Why? <br><br>  The fact is that very few people defined the basic principles of the operation of a bubble in Runet in such detail.  I assure you, not many Ashman epic is different from the suffering of top in another Internet company.  In addition, no one wrote about our native bubbles with such frankness, naming names, passwords, turnout.  Well, of course, the names are slightly changed, but in this narrow world absolutely everything is recognizable even by a hint. <br><br>  That is, for the first time, Runet, on the example of the book of Ashmanov, spoke about the ethics of throwing out internal information to the external market.  And about the rules, the ethics of exit for the top.  That is, about the boundary between PR and betrayal. <br><br>  Let's be honest: any, even very distant memoirs - this is some betrayal of the people and events described.  The author gives a subjective assessment, puts crosses and tags, treats as he sees and understands himself, and the environment is powerless to listen to the stated version. <br><br>  Shy attempts to ‚Äúblather‚Äù: everything is wrong, and I wasn‚Äôt in the city at all on that day, they only persuaded a respectable audience - if a camel is justified, it means.  Therefore, it is obvious that most often the readers remember the one who presented his point of view first.  And it is considered to be historically correct. <br><br>  Therefore, in the world practice there is a rule: for the public, memoirs (original, uncensored) are opened, even not after the author‚Äôs death, but after standing for another 30 years when a generation leaves the stage.  So do the great ones. <br><br>  But in RuNet - ordinary mortals.  And who in 30 years will remember Rambler?  Especially with its <a href="http://dmalin.livejournal.com/6047.html">current development strategy</a> .  Yes, and PR is needed now - great times for its monetization.  Therefore, the ‚Äúrules of traitors‚Äù are so relevant for Runet tops. <br><br>  <strong>Rules "traitors"</strong> <br><br>  <em>(I will make a reservation right away - the term ‚Äútraitor‚Äù does not bear my personal negative attitude towards the participants of these events. This is the name of the tops who ‚Äúsoundly‚Äù leave any company).</em> <br><ul><li>  Never call in the memoirs of names, well, if you are not going to commit suicide.  The market is narrow - you will meet again.  But at the same time come up with ‚Äútransparent‚Äù pseudonyms - the market must unravel.  Otherwise, the public is not interested. </li><li>  Try not to overwork yourself seriously.  But if it does not work out, lie beautifully - the winners are not judged </li><li>  Write only about branded companies - the ruin of middle peasants is of no interest to anyone. </li><li>  Winners are not judged.  Therefore, the events write the first.  Run a virus in the network - this is not a matter of jurisdiction.  Let all sign people read it. </li><li>  Ideal for a company to owe you.  It is desirable not three pennies.  Thank the company for this - the lack of money gave impetus to your personal super-business.  So you and Don Quixote, and business man, and just superchel, but they ... What about them ... </li><li>  Write a fun book.  This is the key to commercial success and your personal PR.  smile, for it annoys everyone. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Instead of epilogue</strong> <br><br>  I will buy this book.  And even on occasion, I will take an autograph from both Ashmanov and the volume of Lebedev who issued the volume.  For the story.  But what if? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21312/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21312/</a></p>
