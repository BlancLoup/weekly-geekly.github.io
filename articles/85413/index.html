  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Working with freelancers: friendship, authoritarianism or material incentives</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to my own freelancing experience (the year when the studio was represented on freelance) and by the experience of working with freelancers (we collaborated with about 40 people), some persistent beliefs developed how to build relationships.  Of course, freelancers, like office workers, are divided into different types - from ideological ones, who want to make the world beautiful with their design or code, to those who strictly know that they have certain skills and their value - they usually do not make unnecessary movements, and if u do, then for extra cost.  This is revealed by reviews and the first minutes of communication.  And this is not the most important, because ideological ones can be obligatory, while material-oriented ones can break deadlines, and vice versa.  We, like many customers, do not require more than what is described in the TK and agreed in advance.  For extra work we pay extra money.  The question is how to ensure that both of them do not break deadlines and keep their promises. <br>  In my opinion, the ways of mass, but they can be defined in three main groups of lines of conduct: friendship, authoritarianism and material incentives. <br>  More about each. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Friendship does not appear immediately, it must be earned.  She is the smallest line of conduct according to the number of freelancers with whom I practice, and with us there are only 2 clients.  This is sometimes good, sometimes not.  You can ask a freelance friend to work additionally if you have an emergency, or you can let him feel sad or enjoy life after hours for 2 days.  But there is also another thing, when the working relationship is a mix of friendship, working on a common idea and friendly chatter, which defuses the working environment - this is very good.  Then there is trust and stability.  Of all the relationships with freelancers, I prefer these.  I like. <br><br>  Authoritarianism.  I am a rather soft person and it is difficult for me to put moral pressure on a person - it‚Äôs difficult to remember a case when I interacted with freelancers like that.  But on the example she recently experienced this.  The customer is a man, he needed an online store in a short time.  We do quality work - because the site is created for 2-3 days, and at best for a month.  In his situation, the online store was made in 1.5 months.  During this time we worked from 9 to 23 on his project, put pressure on what we are not professionals, if we do it for so long - of course we wanted to prove the opposite, and on my birthday in the evening I had to talk about his project.  It was difficult - the person just morally pressed, blamed all the time and did not believe in the result.  As a result, I received a good site, broke up with us in a good mood and wrote a positive review.  By the way, to say - after that I really wanted to do everything very well for him.  Here is a paradox.  But I really don't want to try this.

      The last way - material incentives, or as I still wanted to call it - the usual normal work.  In the first two cases - emotions still prevailed, in this last one - normal commodity-market relations prevail - there is work, which has deadlines, there is a budget - which is allocated for this work and ideally coincides with temporary labor costs of a specialist.  This is the most common way to work with freelancers - you keep your distance and on time you ask them to do work, pay money for quality and performance on time or <br>  fine for deadlines or improper quality. Everything is simple and without emotion.  So it is more convenient to work both sides.  And the first and second, if the first time passed adequately happy to work more.  I always try to work according to this scheme.  Although friendly with many freelancers who constantly work with us. <br><br>  How do you work with freelancers? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85413/</a></p>
