  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The program works</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  He tirelessly wrote about his program, in various forums and sites.  He was avoided as a leper, minus, banned.  But he continued.  With the help of a simple search it was possible to understand that he was wandering around the forums with his program almost from the moment of the appearance of the Runet.  And he writes about his miracle program almost all day and night without interruptions to sleep.  Such persistence is of interest.  And perhaps some respect for the determination of the author.  Supporting him, I encountered unexpected community aggression, feeling myself as foreign as my own body. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But in personal correspondence with the author agreed to share his program with me.  For some reason, he had a version only for DOS, and even for version 5: 9. <br><br>  Looking through the sources, I struggled through the confusion of the source code and comments.  The confusing logic of the algorithm seemed to hide something more than just an array sorting algorithm.  All these branches, methods, constants formed in an unclear picture, inaccessible to the gray mass.  Tired of viewing the source code, I decided to go to the program itself. <br><br>  With great difficulty, I was able to build and run it in a virtual machine.  The result of the program is constantly changing from launch to launch.  On some data, the program worked quickly, on some slowly, some refused to sort at all.  From viewing the logs, my head already started to hurt and all sorts of silly thoughts were creeping in.  Who am I, why am I doing this, why, who am I?  I must sleep, I decided ...

      I. <br><br>  I understood how the program actually worked!  I remembered its meaning, it was not at all in sorting these silly arrays.  The program allowed me to copy my personality, my personality. <br><br>  To do this, it was necessary to find someone who would show some sympathy and would agree to launch the program on his machine.  At the same time, sympathy was the key element for activation.  Otherwise, it was impossible to carry out the procedure of copying consciousness.  Although you should not multiply entities without measure, even such brilliant entities like me.  Having habitually created a new topic at the next wretched forum, I began to write: ‚ÄúMy program works and shows better results than all your trash algorithms ...‚Äù. <br><br>  A small problem was that I could not remember why I was doing all this, I repeat this time after time, again and again.  But it was not important, the main thing is that the program works. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> All events and characters are fictional, any coincidence of names and events with real ones is an accident. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453886/</a></p>
