  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Magic quadrant" IaaS providers from Gartner</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the global market for infrastructure cloud services IaaS is in a state of transformation, many providers are changing their strategies being unable to obtain a significant market share.  Customers should be careful when choosing providers.  When people think about moving to the cloud, infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) is the first thing that comes to mind.  In 2014, for the first time, the absolute increase in the workload of IaaS clouds exceeded the increase in workload on advanced applications.  The market remains immature, but evolves rapidly.  The distribution of market shares tends to increase in concentration, despite the explosive growth of the market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2014 was the year when IaaS cloud providers were scoring results, and many of them recognized their strategies as leading to failure.  Some of them have created completely new IaaS platforms or are in the process of significant changes to previously created solutions.  Others are considering opportunities or are in the process of turning the strategy towards providing services based on leading provider platforms. <br><br>  Many players in the ranks say that they intend to stop or significantly reduce investment in their cloud IaaS offerings, while others plan to withdraw from the market or replace their platforms.  Gartner Agency urges buyers to be extremely careful in choosing suppliers, to specify the plans for the development of services and to require the existence of contractual obligations that prohibit substantially altering or terminating the provision of services for at least 12 months. <br>  Cloud IaaS today is used for development and testing environments, HPC, websites and web applications, as well as non-critical business applications. <br><br>  The number of organizations using cloud IaaS for business-critical applications (according to Gartner - 28% in 2014), and planning a full migration to the cloud is increasing.  Migration is most often carried out in order to avoid capital expenditures, such as updating IT equipment or creating a data center.  A survey by CIO, conducted by Gartner in 2015, showed that 83% of CIOs consider IaaS a good option for infrastructure development, and 10% their default option (‚ÄúFlipping to Digital Leadership: The 2015 CIO Agenda‚Äù).

      The Magic Quadrant introduced ranks IaaS providers to meet Gartner customer needs: the need to have a data center in the cloud, where the customer retains most of the operational responsibility (even if he subsequently meets to outsource this responsibility to third-party managed services).  Gartner's customers are primarily corporations, medium-sized businesses, and technology companies of all sizes, and the results of the assessment focus on typical customer requirements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/683/91a/9ed/68391a9ed975495799e65b65f7b5e1e0.png"><br><br>  <b>Leaders</b> <br>  Leaders stand out in the market by offering services that are suitable for strategic business development and ambitious plans.  Their solutions are applicable in a wide range of cases, although they are not ideal in all possible areas and may not be the best in specific cases.  They have a significant list of success stories, market share and many well-known customers. <br><br>  <b>Challengers (Challengers)</b> <br>  Applicants are successfully positioned to address individual actual marketing needs.  They provide a good service aimed at special cases of application, and successfully solve business problems.  However, they cannot quickly adapt to the challenges of the market or do not have sufficient aspirations. <br><br>  <b>Visionaries</b> <br>  Seers have an ambitious vision of the future and make significant investments in the development of unique technologies.  They may be new market participants or existing cloud service providers changing their business.  Their solutions have many possibilities of development, but are applicable only in a narrow range of use cases. <br><br>  <b>Niche Players (Niche Players)</b> <br>  Niche players can be excellent providers in highly specialized areas, but their solutions are not distinguished by a wide product line and are not applicable for use in all cases.  They may be relatively new entrants in this market, or they may not yet win a significant market share.  Some may hold solid leadership positions in related markets, but are in the early stages of developing the capabilities of the IaaS cloud services.  Providers that specialize in management services based on a fairly good IaaS platform can be in this category.  The higher the specialization of customer needs, the more likely the applicability of niche player solutions. <br><br><br>  <b>Microsoft Azure</b> <br><ul><li>  Microsoft Azure covers integrated IaaS and PaaS components that function as a unit.  New features and services appear quickly.  The system offers not only a leading solution for offline work, but also the possibility of seamless integration with Microsoft's on-line infrastructure, development tools, applications and Microsoft SaaS services. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  The Microsoft brand, a broad customer base, significant investment in development, and aggressive product development plans have enabled it to quickly reach the status of a strategic IaaS provider.  Microsoft Azure is growing rapidly and is in second place in terms of market share, surpassing the competitors behind it by more than 2 times (except for market share leader Amazon Web Services).  Microsoft has to maintain Amazon-comparable public prices, but in practice, customers with discounts under the Microsoft Enterprise License Agreement get a price-performance ratio to compete with Amazon. </li></ul><br><br>  Analytics for other vendors, as well as the original text of the article are available in the Gartner report <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do%3Fid%3D1-2G45TQU%26ct%3D150519%26st%3Dsb%252F">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260323/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260323/</a></p>
