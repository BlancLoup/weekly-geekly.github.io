Three steps: how can Sberbank become your partner?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have good news: the prospect of long-term cooperation with Sberbank and METRO CashandCarry has appeared.  The article will tell how everything turned out. <br><br>  <b>Step 1: Market Analysis</b> <br><br>  In order not to be trapped in front of professionals, it is important to conduct a sketch.  More specifically, find out the needs of potential customers and their possible problems, including the shortcomings of existing systems.  We set ourselves a task: to probe the market and understand how this market will react to our offer.

      There are many prospects for development and distribution of our product; companies are showing a healthy interest in Workly.  The most interesting thing is that we accurately anticipated the market needs for mobile applications Timepad and Clientapp.  But it's not just them.  On the territory of the CIS there is still no system similar in functionality to ours - it is flexible, changeable, and we approach it as a product capable of combining all the HR of a particular enterprise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66c/c1a/51e/66cc1a51ecfd4b6b8a4592ecc23fe3dc.jpg"><br><br>  Analyzed the market, estimated the potential needs of customers.  After that, we identified the target audience and started looking for ways to connect with this or that person. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Step 2: Search and Mailing</b> <br><br>  Let's say right away: finding contacts and getting in touch with big players is quite difficult.  Well, if there are useful links and people who could recommend your product.  But starting a conversation with a stranger by correspondence is another matter. <br><br>  It took us a month and a half to get in touch with all potential customers.  As for the search methods, in war, as they say, all means are good.  Basically, we took the personal addresses of the right people, searched for them on Linkedin and corporate sites.  There are two useful articles on <a href="http://texterra.ru/blog/kak-nayti-email-cheloveka-polnoe-rukovodstvo.html">Textterra</a> and <a href="https://vc.ru/p/find-any-email-for-ten-minutes">VC,</a> and they tell in detail how to find the e-mail of the right person. <br><br>  Be careful when it comes to writing a letter.  It is important to hook a potential client with good text.  It is not necessary to write in the letter all the functionality of the product - you just need to tell about its value and about the help it will provide.  It is important to write letters from the first person and address the potential partner personally, by name.  Thus, a person will understand that the letter is not a regular mailing, which can be safely noted as spam. <br><br>  That is how we found representatives of Sberbank and METRO CashandCarry.  They offered them to get acquainted with the product, and here it is, the result - they themselves invited us to a meeting. <br><br>  <b>Step 3: Personal meeting</b> <br><br>  Both companies have moments that worry them.  For example, improving team discipline and increasing overall productivity.  And there is also the risk of familiarity between operators and line managers, which is important to minimize. <br><br>  The first presentations of the product we conduct online.  In addition, potential customers can register in the application for a short time, test it and personally get acquainted with the main functions.  In this case, we control the process, helping people to better understand the subtleties.  But, bearing in mind the scope for customization, the system is better to show on the fingers.  Therefore, we went to a meeting with clients to discuss all the questions and demonstrate the possibilities. <br><br>  <b>How will we work next?</b> <br><br>  We have a lot of work ahead.  Although both companies set similar tasks, such as scheduling and visiting records, the approach to each project of this level requires serious customization from us.  To begin with, we will arrange testing: we will equip several points of these companies with the accounting system of working time, we will look at the efficiency and get TK.  Based on this, we will move on, adapt the product and, with a successful scenario, increase the scale of cooperation. <br><br>  Sberbank and METRO CashandCarry are complex structured companies, so it is impossible to immediately talk about large-scale integration at the federal level.  But, we hope that with new customers we will develop a long-term and productive relationship. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/939/efd/855/939efd855d2540e38007557e33ad40b7.jpg"><br><br>  Now it's time for us to start working with new partners.  Project managers, scrum masters and project teams will participate in the processes from both sides.  They will define the tasks and take care of their implementation.  Be agile or die. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Benefit  The product that you represent, should solve the headache of the customer, generate income and facilitate the work.  For this, market analysis and search for options are important. </li><li>  Respect the customer.  The newsletter actually works.  The main thing is that it does not look like spam: each letter contains a sentence of a truly useful product and is made up individually for each client. </li><li>  Do not be afraid.  When you find the contacts of a person of interest, it is not at all difficult to compose a letter and send it.  Not the fact that everyone will answer, but almost every potential client will already know about your existence. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>PS</b> See the product that will be used by Sberbank and METRO CashandCarry <a href="http://workly.io/">here.</a> <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> Subscribe to our blog - we will constantly share practical cases from personal experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300196/</a></p>
