In this article I will tell you about what I like in Redmine, and compare it with our previous installation of Trac.

      As I understand it from the Trac mailing list and discussions in some comments on tickets (authored by major developers), the main goal of Trac is to create a stable and simple system or platform that could be expanded with plug-ins.  This is a great goal ... But (and these ‚Äúbut‚Äù quite a few) if you manage multiple Trac installations, this vision turns against you pretty quickly.  Below are some of the main things I miss in Trac. <br><br><h4>  Numerous projects </h4><br>  The initial reason for switching to Redmine was the lack of support for several projects in Trac.  I know that you can modify Trac (see <a href="http://trac-hacks.org/">trac-hacks.org</a> ) to include support for several projects, but I don‚Äôt like such changes.  There have been several discussions about how Trac should support several projects and whether it should do it at all, but the fact remains that there is no solution to this problem out of the box.  I read something about Trac 2.0 that realizes it, I think we will see it in the year 2015 ... <br><br>  Redmine has support for several projects.  Integration throughout the system is great.  You can create nested subprojects and move error reports and tickets from one project to another.  For each project, you can assign different users and enable or disable certain functionality (work plan, time tracking, source code management, etc.). <br><br><img src="http://www.digitalbase.eu/blog/wp-content/uploads//2009/01/redmine-projects.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Batch editing tickets and error reports </h4><br>  I have to agree that the Trac ticket system is very powerful and flexible.  Without a doubt, Trac is one of the most common and stable tools for managing projects and tracking errors for a very good reason.  You can easily search and filter tickets by importance, component, version or owner, and then save filters.  It is perfectly. <br><img src="http://www.digitalbase.eu/blog/wp-content/uploads//2009/01/trac-tickets.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What I really lacked when using Trac was the possibility of batch editing (changing / closing / moving) several tickets at the same time.  It is in this case that the batch editing of Redmine based on AJAX comes in handy. <br><br><img src="http://www.digitalbase.eu/blog/wp-content/uploads//2009/01/redmine-mass-issue-update.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  User and Role Management </h4><br>  Managing users in Redmine is great!  In addition to simple management, customizable roles are supported.  You can set different user roles in different projects. <br><br>  Trac does not support user management out of the box.  Unlike error tracking systems, which usually have a table for storing users, Trac has adopted an approach that allows users to use the numerous authorization modules available for their web server.  This means that system administrators can redirect Trac requests to something like LDAP, Active Directory, or any other centralized user management system that they already have. <br><br>  So which is better?  Complex issue.  I am a big supporter of out-of-the-box software.  Not too much configuration, easy installation.  This does not mean that the software should be ‚Äúsimple‚Äù: flexibility and ease of setup can go hand in hand.  At the same time, I believe that Redmine has the best approach to good user management immediately after installation.  If you need something more centralized, LDAP is also supported. <br><br><h4>  A large number of updates / new features </h4><br>  I am sure that Trac is more stable than Redmine.  So if you need a stable product, use Trac.  But since we are a small web design company, the stability of the working environment is not really critical for us. <br><br>  What I am looking for in project management software is new approaches and ideas for improving our teamwork.  I keep an eye on the history of activity on the Redmine project to see how other people use this platform.  Some of their comments and comments inspire us to change the way we work, or to use the functionality that we did not pay due attention to before. <br><br><h4>  Anything else? </h4><br>  Of course, there are some things that Trac does much better.  First of all, Trac has a large community with many main developers, Redmine is built around one or several people.  In addition, the Trac version control repository browser is much more powerful and intuitive. <br><br>  I used Trac for a long time, and I really respect all the guys who work on this rock solid project.  But, as I said earlier, Trac's strengths are his weaknesses.  In an attempt to keep the system as light as possible, discussions about possible functions usually end with the decision ‚ÄúNot in the core‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Thanks for the karma, transferred to Project Management. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63724/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63724/</a></p>
