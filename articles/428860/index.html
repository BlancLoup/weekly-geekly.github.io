      Thus, with just a few memory dump commands, we found the place where Coreflood hid.  We disassembled, extracted and pasted the PE header, even without it, and got a fully restored address table in less than 20 seconds. <br><br>  The next story is called ‚ÄúHoney, sorry for bothering you again - I have stung the internet!‚Äù  This story tells that the defective IP generator Conficker.B scans only part of the Internet.  Here we go back to the rand function.  An important part of this function is the most recent instruction, which I marked with a green arrow - it performs any final value in EAX with a value of 7FFF.  If you are not familiar with the principles of assembly and do not know what this instruction can do, here is a small demo about this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a8/dh/lj/a8dhljmvnb6hrmu1hrhyosfityw.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We move the maximum value that EAX can contain into this registry and execute the final instruction.  You can see that it ‚Äúchops off‚Äù the upper half of the value and then subtracts 7FFF, which is converted to the number 32767 in the decimal system. Apparently, the authors did not realize that this limit that Windows starts does not return the whole number to the integer number .  It "cuts off" it so that the value does not exceed 7FFF, so that one byte of 7F will never be greater than this value of 7F, that is, it will never be equal to 80 or something like that. <br><br>  Further in the left part of the slide, which I called the ‚ÄúVicious Method‚Äù, you see the Conficker.B code.  Shown here is one rand call that initiates the first octet of an IP address, which is intended to be scanned after it returns from rand.  The next rand system call initiates the third and fourth octets of the IP address, but because of the above, two of these octets will never be greater than 7F.  Thus, most of the Internet will not be able to be scanned due to the fact that Conficker.B uses this algorithm. <br><br>  On the right side of the slide is a part of the source code showing the work of the assembler.  It is difficult to read on the screen, but this example is publicly available, and you can read it online if you are interested. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5u/oj/tb/5uojtbhnvqiisohatadjziviyw8.jpeg"><br><br>  At the bottom of the next slide, entitled ‚ÄúSimulating the Perverse Method‚Äù, is a link to this tool.  You also see that the IP address is generated from PRNG, but not scanned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7f/bd/vf/7fbdvfj000swmtbqwf7sdddjz3o.jpeg"><br><br>  I want to say a big thank you to Brandon Enright, who made the graph on the next slide.  This graph is called the ‚ÄúHilbert curve,‚Äù and I‚Äôll now zoom in to make it more visible on the screen.  The blue color on the graph indicates the range of IP addresses that are not available for scanning by Conficker.B using this vicious algorithm.  Dark red color indicates what can be scanned.  You see that most parts of the graph are not dark red, but purple, and you will not see why this happens until you increase the corresponding rectangle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h0/-y/ar/h0-yarvdaqxrhr0a078wmwxmj-c.jpeg"><br><br>  Even in this enlarged rectangle, in each block / 16, you see a lot of blue fragments that turn a dark red color into purple.  These are the portions of addresses that Conficker.B is unable to scan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/z0/gb/jvz0gbqxngvlelc8vzavmvgmulk.jpeg"><br><br>  This is quite interesting because many people believe that Conficker.B created ‚Äúgreat minds‚Äù.  Perhaps it is, but these minds were not aware of the limitations that rand () exists in Windows. <br><br>  <b>Matthew Richard:</b> back to those guys who, as I said, do not manage their viruses too well, so in cybercrime it is akin to the proverb ‚Äúman is a wolf‚Äù, therefore these guys are not respected in their circles. <br><br>  Let's talk about the hacker toolkit Neosploit, which ‚Äúgot‚Äù everyone.  We can say that the motto of its developers was ‚ÄúThank you for the cash, now it's time to run.‚Äù  Neosploit is a set of tools for organizing web attacks, so the cybercrime guys will buy it and tune it against the guys on the server, hack the server, download codes, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ri/s1/bf/ris1bfmqjh1vrnr2a7hohfm13hg.jpeg"><br><br>  The creators of Neosploit made a good investment by selling their instrument, but not allowing it to change, modify, or use its individual parts.  The third version of this toolkit was released in April 2008, and most unique exploits are written in C, so this is not PHP or some kind of lame web application.  Clients received a binary distribution with a set of CGI exploits. <br><br>  Neosploit has features that prevent clients from sharing or cutting exploits.  For this, all exploits were presented in binary format, encrypted using XOR.  The creators made it so that no one could cut, glue and create their own set of exploits based on Neosploit.  There are 40-50-60 different types of web attacks, based on stolen and copied codes inserted into their own exploits, so the Neosploit guys turned out to be a bit smarter by encrypting their exploits from the inside.  In the screenshot you can see that they have a file with the key neosploit.key, so this is fully licensed software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fn/uj/zq/fnujzqvxmuxcczupacqnibg2udq.jpeg"><br><br>  I have no doubt that they had a bunch of really good customers, on whom they made a lot of money.  Their most famous customers were Torpig.  I think you heard about the Mebroot rootkit, with which they compromised the system to create a botnet network.  But the creators of Neosploit had many other customers.  In May 2008, they released a fresh enhancement - the 3rd version of their toolkit.  Customers were asked to make a prepayment of a package of exploits with all subsequent updates for $ 1000.  Later, I‚Äôll tell you more about this, for now I‚Äôll notice that they were really worried about the pirates and were trying to protect their product from them as much as possible, so it was definitely a lot of fun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ri/o0/gq/rio0gq0dwfkuxt4cvuiu8agdafs.jpeg"><br><br>  Even the media wrote that these exploits are everywhere.  So by itself, we will try to disassemble the code and show how Neosploit works. <br><br>  The first fun thing they did after they vigorously unwound this set of exploits from April to July ‚Äî this stopped its support from July 20, 2008. In the explanation that they just posted on their website, it was said: ‚ÄúUnfortunately , further product support is not feasible.  We apologize for the inconvenience, but the business is a business, and the time spent on the project is not justified.  We have tried to meet the requirements of our clients until the last months, but sometime the support had to stop.  We have been with you for a year and a half and we hope that this was not the worst time for your business.  Now we will not be near you, but, nevertheless, we wish your business to flourish for a very long time. ‚Äù  In general, we received your money, you paid a subscription, so be healthy! <br><br>  However, they just joked and in August 2008 they returned again and released a completely new version 3.1, which they provided to their key customers, indicating that all other customers will receive an update after they pay for it.  This update contains several new exploits for Adobe PDF, Shockwave Flash and Quicktime for Firefox. <br><br>  Then they decided to be serious again and announced that they were actually stopping the release of updates, so that everyone who made a prepayment of a subscription was screwed up. <br><br>  So, let's go over to the consideration of Neosploit, this pretty cool web-based attack kit.  Since its developers fought against pirates and theft of exploits, which could be copied and pasted into someone else's kits, they took each exploit and placed it in a CGI file, coding it in such a way that it was very difficult to get it out.  Binary exploit files written in C were slightly different from PHP scripts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ng/sh/fy/ngshfybrz6rq6bop8mraqqh2zzo.jpeg"><br><br>  In the Neosploit blog, the phrase Dancho Danchev was posted that ‚Äúanyone can create a new exploit‚Äù, but this is rather difficult.  I decided to find out how difficult it is and proceeded to disassemble one of the exploits. <br><br>  Each exploit was stored in encrypted form using a 3-byte XOR key.  For each incoming request, the exploit was decrypted and made available to the user for work, and this cycle was constantly repeated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ej/xa/xr/ejxaxrxb3favuqswsknbhqvzqxk.jpeg"><br><br>  So even if you could get through the memory, and removing the memory dump is still quite difficult, and getting all the exploits, still these buffers are cleared every time. <br><br>  Fortunately, if you can copy and paste these exploits into the program you need, you can find the answer.  It uses a very powerful decryption tool - IDA scripting.  With it, you can comment or remove a dump of a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãmemory, update exploits, it can be useful for working with malware that uses lines complicated by xor, base64, etc.  I wrote an IDE script with which I tried to disassemble the captured memory dump of an encrypted exploit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ph/lh/04/phlh04jr_lkm9h6ammkwchmc5fs.jpeg"><br><br>  It goes through all the encrypted objects, searches for all calls to the decryption functions, captures the encrypted objects, decrypts them using XOR and then takes a dump.  This is one way, but I think you could write your own script, an application that does the same.  If you know how to add new exploits to Neosploit, then you can do something in this direction and of course, once you remove the dump, you will know the whole plaintext, you can ‚Äúrip out‚Äù the instrumentation and resell it.  New guys developing exploits just gave up, because someone earned good money without worrying about their customers. <br><br>  If anyone has heard of the great hip-hop philosopher Biggy Smalls from Notorius BIG, he knows his song called Ten crack commandments, ‚ÄúThe Ten Commandments of Crack,‚Äù which contains great wisdom.  If you are a drug dealer, then observe the 4 commandments: "Never sit on your own foolishness, which you are pushing."  Probably the guy whom I called Peeper and who distributed his own malicious code never heard this song because I tested my product on myself. <br><br>  His attack was as follows.  He sent emails disguised as various government agencies and appealing to people by name: ‚ÄúDear such-and-such, someone filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission about your company, so click here to download the document, which details the essence‚Äù . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/3e/jk/pd3ejkz0sqnukrbmaqwfa7dpcnc.jpeg"><br><br>  Then the user followed the link and tried to download this document, and it really was a Word document in the .doc format.  However, there was one very tricky feature.  You had the opportunity to simply drag the executable files from the Word document and then rename them, but when you try to download the file, a message appears: ‚ÄúMicrosoft Word detected a problem and the document could not be loaded.  Please double click on the document icon to continue. ‚Äù  Awesome idea! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ej/5h/dq/ej5hdqstxn-ym3rh6ymrgjgdimo.jpeg"><br><br>  Naturally, people clicked, they clicked 6 times to get this infected message, so this guy had a lot of victims.  I liked this post: ‚ÄúThey tried to fool me, blah blah blah.‚Äù <br><br>  The next thing we found, tracking this guy, is the open directories of the Drop Directory, where he dumped the received information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-y/cf/f-/-ycff-c-idisj5uxijtbakrzvdu.jpeg"><br><br>  He may not have had his own tools for managing them or he thought that open directories is a good thing, but open directories are bad if you store a lot of information received from different people.  Any server that he would have set up for his ‚Äúlanding‚Äù site had an open directory, and you could just go there and view the lists of all its victims and each one individually. <br><br>  In a sense, he was a good developer, because he wrote quality code.  But his disadvantage was that by addressing his code to the current server, he used his real IP address, and you would not last long using such things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zz/jc/rq/zzjcrqpcs9r8e3bc-271cp3vroi.jpeg"><br><br>  So in fact, he had a standard DSL modem that communicated from Ukraine, he tested all his code and malware, which has a good function called ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù, or ‚Äúwatch it‚Äù.  This guy was involved in stealing banking information, but sometimes he just wanted to watch his victims to see what they were doing, so we called him Peeper, or ‚ÄúObserver.‚Äù  He was not satisfied with the simple functionality of his software, he began to monitor himself.  It looks rather strange, as if you opened VNC remote access windows on your own computer and looped them, getting smaller and smaller images.  In fact, he did this many times, on many landing servers, in fact, it was very, very strange.  So looking through these ‚Äúlanding‚Äù servers, one could say: ‚Äúoh, look, this is a picture, where he watches himself, watching himself, who watches himself.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tu/v1/6v/tuv16vk5cws25lqpqr0lymirwto.jpeg"><br><br>  "My light, mirror, tell me, who is the kindest in the world"? <br><br>  Most of all I liked what he did for himself.  He used this ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù feature in the code development process.  In fact, he wrote the code, watching himself, sending it all back to the command and control server.  Thus, he gave the opportunity to the official to break through the back door, lay his face on the floor and confiscate his computer.  In short, nothing helps to get rid of you, as the image of the source tree associated with your IP address. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q0/ic/f9/q0icf9sq3191sbbcj2jk27t5eiw.jpeg"><br><br>  The last piece of malware that we are going to look for will certainly interest people who are well acquainted with Internet Explorer 7. But don't worry, Microsoft says that everything is under control, trust them! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/7r/2f/dw7r2f9zbestlmksm14of1q72dc.jpeg"><br><br>  So, Microsoft had a big problem with Internet Explorer 6, due to the fact that it was very easy to steal saved passwords from this browser.  Usually you go to the site, you are asked if you want to save the password, a special form is called, you answer "yes", and it is saved in the registry.  The problem with IE 6 was that if you log in as a user, all you need to do is make one CryptUnprotectData () system call to decrypt these passwords, which really do not have protection. <br><br>  Therefore, malware running with the user's authority freely read these passwords and sent them to the attacker.  Therefore, in IE 7, they installed a great ‚Äúpatch‚Äù - passwords were encrypted with a 128-bit key.  Really no hackable solution! <br>  If you look deeper, you can see the hash that is available on the site, I will explain this a little later, in which there is a binary file containing the username and password.  I want to quote another great philosopher, John Travolta, from the Swordfish movie.  My favorite passage is when he sits there and explains: "This cipher is so good that even I can't hack it."  I think he meant 512-bit encryption, and he, the world's best cryptographer, why he was hired, says that even he cannot do it. <br><br>  So, that's what Microsoft did.  They encrypt the password, for which they will generate a 128-bit key based on the MD5 hash of the site for which they store this password.  This seems quite reasonable, so if you go to <a href="">www.bank.com/login.sp</a> , they will take this line, make all the letters lowercase, then recode them into large characters and use the MD5 algorithm, turning this line into a key, which will be used to encrypt the password in the registry for the username. <br><br>  Then, when you visit this site for which there is a saved password, they do the opposite: IE normalizes the URL, recodes the string and looks in the registry to see if there are any values ‚Äã‚Äãstored for you.  In detail this happens as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  read the register hash for each URL in index.dat; </li><li>  URL is converted to lower case; </li><li>  GET parameters are reduced; </li><li>  URL is converted to large characters; </li><li>  if the hash of the URL value is equal to any value in the register, the data is decrypted using this URL. </li></ul><br>  It seems pretty reasonable, but if you think about it, there is a small problem here.  In fact, there is too little entropy here, and a hacker can easily handle it.  This is not much more complicated than encrypting passwords in IE 6. <br><br>  Hacking it is pretty simple.  To save the password, the user must visit the site, which can then be easily found in index.dat or in the ‚ÄúTypedURLS‚Äù registry key section.  If we consider only the United States, there are about 15,000 sites of banks and credit unions, and you can easily find them.  You know the sites for which you want to find passwords, and each such site has login pages, so it is easy enough to collect a whole collection of keys.  As you can see, the protection here is clearly insufficient. <br><br>  Of course, if you're a bad guy, you probably know a lot of sites that need passwords: Facebook, Myspace or Twitter, or others with a login page, so you can just figure out such sites.  You can use the Alexa service, which keeps a list of the most popular sites, collecting statistics on their attendance.  The keys are really easy to decipher, you can make something like a Rainbow Table ‚Äúrainbow table‚Äù based on these common sources, and then you will have all the keys for decrypting passwords. <br><br>      ,      IE 7  :    ,     . <br><br>      ?  , .       .       ,  Mozilla Firefox,  ,           .      ,      ,     ,   ¬´Remember My password¬ª.         .
