  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cisco is engaged in servers?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About six months ago, I first heard about the fact that Cisco not only produces network equipment, but also took up the server business.  Having rummaged through the Internet, it turned out that Cisco server Blade systems are now very successful and many large customers are already using them in their infrastructures.  According to IDC, for 2011, Cisco ranked 3rd in the world in sales of Blade-systems, overtaking DELL, Fujitsu and SUN. <br><br>  But what if I need a regular Rack server?  It turns out that in this segment, Cisco is releasing several interesting solutions.  Currently 4 types of servers are available: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84d/450/07b/84d45007bf9dc9a8aea47d38e3ee6496.jpg" alt="image">

      Having received at the disposal of 2 servers - C200 and C210 and having slightly twisted them in hands, I also decided to write this note. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Honestly, some negative moments immediately caught my eye: the top cover is hard to remove, the buttons for removing disks work tightly, there are no USB and VGA connectors in front (instead of them there is a special connector that connects the cable with USB and VGA outputs).  The server package does not include driver disks and additional software, although I want to note that Windows 2008 was no problem, and did not even have to download anything from the manufacturer‚Äôs website. <br><br><br>  Now about the good points.  Up to 2 power supplies can be installed in both models, which undoubtedly adds reliability.  In addition, the power supply units from the C200 and C210 are suited to each other, which facilitates the search for a replacement component.  Rightfully considered a trendsetter in network technologies, Cisco could not leave its servers without a high-quality network infrastructure: each server comes with a full-fledged IPMI controller, which by default can transmit high-quality video-image and allows you to mount remote CD / DVD / iso.  The IPMI controller is called CIMC - Cisco Integrated Management Controller.  It was surprising for me that CIMC, unlike iLO Advanced from HP or iDRAC Enterprise from DELL, is delivered absolutely free of charge in any server configuration.  The interface is intuitive, because most of the basic functions are displayed on the main page. <br><br><br>  Sample CIMC Management Screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfc/d2f/9a7/dfcd2f9a7f936cd04f2584950f75e811.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I accidentally discovered that in servers with 3.5 ‚Äùdisks, instead of disc plugs for disks, there is a sled.  When I called Cisco representatives, I wondered if it was possible to use third-party disks in this skid, because they even come with optical fibers, and received a negative response.  Just in case, I checked Seagate drives, similar models, as native Cisco's drives.  Work!  It turns out that the Cisco UCS C200 server can be used as an excellent replacement for self-assembling servers such as Supermicro, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22a/de8/fa1/22ade8fa12f4e0c571159742e33b6ffd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another interesting feature of Rack-execution servers was the ability to connect them to the Blade infrastructure.  That is, any server can be connected to the Fabric Interconnect modules from the Blade system and get access to full server management, starting from temperature monitoring on memory modules and setting up virtual interfaces, ending with fine-tuning BIOS settings and network boot options. <br><br><br>  In conclusion, I want to say that although Cisco has begun to produce rack-mount servers, their portfolio of proposals has not yet been completed.  In order to fully participate in the struggle for the server market, the company lacks tower-execution servers.  For the rest of the parameters, Cisco can now compete with manufacturers such as HP, IBM and DELL. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137671/</a></p>
