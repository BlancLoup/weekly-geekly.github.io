  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Successful Internet projects: Our for the West</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How many successful Internet projects made by Russians do we know?  Made by Russians for the bourgeois, for an English-speaking audience.  I tried to remember, and could not.  Today, in my first post, after a half-year registration at Habr√©, I want to tell you about the project <a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/">Ultimate-Guitar.com</a> , which is founded by Russians living in Russia and not at all in Moscow. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Idea</strong> <br><br>  Back in 1998, a certain zappp (I don‚Äôt want to advertise the name and surname, he will find it himself) was founded by a small archivator of guitar chords (guitar-tabs), which was registered at Ultimate-Guitar.com. , the site has become increasingly popular, which was noticed by its creators and picked up by them in the form of continuous development and evolution of the resource. <br>  Today, Ultimate-Guitar.com is the fastest-growing community of guitar players with a densely populated forum, news from the world of guitar music, authoring speakers, CD reviews and exclusive interviews with rock stars such as Jeff Beck, System Of A Down, Angus Young, and many others.  It is noteworthy that the team of the site consists of about 20 people who are engaged in constant search and writing interesting and relevant news.  But the main advantage of the site and the core of the community is a unique archive of guitar chords to any little known guitar compositions.  Of course, Ultimate-Guitar.com is not a classic social network, but rather web 1.0 community, but this does not detract from its merits, on the contrary, makes the achievement of our compatriots even more meaningful and, if one can put it that way, sustained.

      <strong>Popularity</strong> <br><br>  We know about such popular topics as music, video, adult, travel and others, but what is known about the topics of guitar tabs?  For clarity, here‚Äôs Google‚Äôs graph, where guitar tabs and, for example, mysql queries are compared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/583/a74/6ef/583a746ef3eb0761c7d28eac9e53d7b6.png" width="450" height="201" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  As you can see, the popularity of the subject is huge, moreover, on this request in Google Ultimate-Guitar.com is in the first place.  Alexa World Puzomerka also confirms the success of the resource by measuring 326 parrots to it.  (for comparison at Digg 163).  Such a ranking according to observations allows you to say a million unik per day (!) And stop hiccups, better be proud of ours))) <br><br>  <strong>Business</strong> <br><br>  The business model is as simple as an ax, Google Adsense and others like them, knowing the attendance is easy to calculate the daily profit in $$$. <br><br>  <strong>Epilogue</strong> <br><br>  Pride for our compatriots and the opportunities that the Western Internet provides inspire.  In addition, in this example, the newfangled ‚Äúoffline + online = success‚Äù link has already been working for a long time, in other words, online life begins in the real world and is inextricably linked with it, can you just imagine how many non-virtual guitarists exist on our planet who don‚Äôt away to find chords for your favorite songs and share your own selections.  Search and develop what ordinary people really need, focus less on ‚Äúgeeks‚Äù and do not overdo it with a gradient in design and then success will certainly come, because the one who believes will not be able to do it differently. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21798/</a></p>
