  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of the smart air humidifier REDMOND SkyDew 3310S with Internet access</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since 2015, REDMOND has been constantly adding new products to its <a href="http://multivarka.pro/catalog/smart_tech/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes">REDMOND Smart Home line</a> .  This line includes all sorts of smart home appliances with remote control via Bluetooth and via the Internet.  By now, these are almost fifty devices!  From the classic elements of a ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù, like a smart outlet and a basement, to an unusual technique for this class - say, a fan heater or a slow cooker.  I personally managed to familiarize myself with almost all REDMOND smart devices and evaluate them in ‚Äúcombat conditions‚Äù, for what kind of models, smartphone control is justified to a greater or lesser extent.  This review <a href="http://multivarka.pro/catalog/tekhnika_dlya_doma/uvlazhnitel_vozdukha_redmond_skydew_3310s/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes">focuses on the REDMOND SkyDew 3310S</a> ultrasonic humidifier.  According to its characteristics, this is a top model with high performance, a huge serviced area (up to 80 square meters) and a spacious tank of 5 liters.  In my opinion, a very nice bonus is the ‚Äútasty‚Äù price / performance ratio, similar models from other manufacturers start from 15,000 rubles.  Here - 10 000 rubles, and even advanced mobile functionality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5da/e4d/534/5dae4d53450d4e7aae7680303324d042.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>REDMOND SkyDew 3310S features:</b>

I explain.  If the humidity of the air in your apartment falls below a certain mark, this can lead to a number of extremely unpleasant consequences.  Starting with dry skin and eyes, continuing exacerbations in those who suffer from chronic diseases of the respiratory system (for example, asthmatics), and ending with problems with the health of young children.  In them, organisms are still being formed, and if an adult will somehow survive dry air, albeit with ‚Äúlosses‚Äù, then it is categorically contraindicated for young citizens (and even more so for infants).  In general, a humidifier is a useful thing, and for some people it is absolutely necessary. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The thing is quite large (which is just normal for a 5-liter humidifier) ‚Äã‚Äãand, I'm not afraid of this word, beautiful (though, as always, at REDMOND).  The case of the REDMOND SkyDew 3310S is made of glossy black plastic.  It is pleasant to look at it, the device does not look like an alien element in an apartment with a modern interior. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5dc/dd5/23b/5dcdd523b62349fb8d68a0ed0a47aa7e.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/954/92a/82a/95492a82a94a48bbafcbd4cd92b2bb06.jpeg"><br><br>  The case is closed with a lid of matte plastic - a reasonable choice, for this part often take hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/977/a40/cff/977a40cff74c45b68bd60dc9d45b1fad.jpeg"><br><br>  On the cover there is a special ‚Äúspout‚Äù for dispersing / releasing water droplets.  Often in humidifiers it is not possible to set the direction of steam output, whereas in the REDMOND model, adjustment is possible by 360 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99a/e60/106/99ae6010608241d29e6119c5fa5e1bca.jpeg"><br><br>  Under the lid is the tank, which occupies almost all the internal space of the humidifier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c5/08c/c35/8c508cc35b934b22b30295c8fc9daf2a.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/889/ef0/83b/889ef083bac94f28ba1f23c4809c581d.jpeg"><br><br>  It's great that a convenient carrying handle is provided on the tank: still 5 liters is not a cup of coffee.  A humidifier can be far enough away from the bathroom or kitchen, where you will collect water in the tank. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/872/b0a/b38/872b0ab38912499ea21d24f57b45ef67.jpeg"><br>  <i>The lid of the tank is reliable, no water leaks were recorded.</i> <br><br>  The filter is fixed on the lid, which is necessary for water purification, because we all know that it is not spring water that flows from the tap.  There are particles of lime, rust and other unpleasant artifacts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12f/12b/019/12f12b019f25461c877db3e0012836e1.jpeg"><br><br>  So that you do not have to breathe all of this, and that it does not settle on the interior in the form of whitish plaque, and you need this very filter.  Its service life is on average 1 year with daily use of a humidifier.  If you use less, then the filter will live longer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec6/516/d8c/ec6516d8cc1f43158de348e06b538660.jpeg"><br><br>  Another small but pleasant feature of the REDMOND SkyDew 3310S is a separate compartment for aromatic oils. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a53/e4b/41e/a53e4b41ee9d4eb2aaafba4b97a26df7.jpeg"><br><br>  I consider it necessary to emphasize that such a chip in the humidifiers is not always there.  Therefore, it is necessary to drip flavors in the tank, and it is sometimes unsafe to fill the humidifier, and it can fail.  In REDMOND SkyDew 3310S this moment is thought out: we push a small tray, drip there, put it back.  So you will not go wrong with the dosage (the volume of the tray is limited), and the device will definitely remain safe and sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a7/7ba/5e4/3a77ba5e430840c883c6d996cc64d666.jpeg"><br><br>  There is a special window on the side panel of the REDMOND SkyDew 3310S, allowing you to see how much water is left in the tank.  By the way, with the complete devastation of "water resources" humidifier is automatically turned off, so as not to idle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a9/5f7/5c9/6a95f75c946b42dc84dea02ce68bc56c.jpeg"><br><br>  On the front - the screen and touch control keys.  However, I propose to consider the management in the next section, to which we now proceed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f59/261/6d8/f592616d8866420990d3b6cce31f6895.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  In work </h2><br>  REDMOND SkyDew 3310S can be controlled in two ways, in both cases almost the same set of options is offered. <br><br>  The first, boring way - this is just using the screen and buttons on the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cf/d30/fcc/1cfd30fcc9494f3cac68adefa07bd2f8.jpeg"><br><br>  The second, much more interesting - from a smartphone connected via Bluetooth.  To do this, we install the Ready for Sky application on an iOS or Android device, create a single account in it and link all of your REDMOND smart devices to it.  After that, we connect the smartphone with the REDMOND SkyDew 3310S via Bluetooth and - voila - your device turns into an advanced remote control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/460/134/c13/460134c1346b4200b29b8314d2130cc5.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/600/159/493/600159493ce6429ca777fb3f83a081c0.jpeg"><br><br>  And via Bluetooth, SkyDew 3310S can be controlled at a distance of up to 15 meters.  Remembering the many doubts of commentators, I emphasize - yes, the connection is really kept at a very impressive distance.  No, not only in open space - even through quite concrete walls.  In my case, the smartphone and humidifier were able to dissolve a maximum of 13 meters, in this mode, I specifically used the model for about a week.  A couple-three times a connection error sign appeared, it was immediately suggested to update the connection, and after 2-3 seconds the connection was restored. <br><br>  Is the start / adjustment function of the humidifier useful when you are in the apartment?  Yes, definitely.  Even if you are in the same room with the device.  Humidifier, in any case, in my experience, a rather spontaneous thing.  You sit quietly, you fix the primus stove, and then voila - the thought comes, something low in humidity, it would be necessary to activate the profile assistant.  Five to six seconds - and through the "spout" a trickle of steam is already coming out.  In addition, any settings from the smartphone are made three times faster than poking buttons on the case.  With the shutdown, the same song is intuitively understood that there is already a complete order with humidity and REDMOND SkyDew 3310S should be interrupted (if the upper level of moisture percentage is not specified).  If it happens at night - you know, to get out several times from a warm bed to turn on / off the humidifier there is no desire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fa/12c/c19/3fa12cc19dbf4fb6bca38ee3b25b4556.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, consoles are pretty popular among humidifiers.  But, as a rule, these are infrared variants with the possibility of giving commands only within the direct line of sight of the humidifier (and in my case it is hidden on the floor behind the bed).  So from the other room, you definitely won‚Äôt launch the device.  In the end, the smartphone in my home is almost always at hand.  And carry around or by all means keep a remote near, you see, it is not too convenient. <br><br>  In addition to Bluetooth, there is the possibility of remote control via the Internet.  To do this, you will need another smartphone or tablet, it will play the role of a home gateway.  With the help of the R4S Gateway application, we connect the REDMOND equipment to this very homely smartphone, and already connect with it from our main office from anywhere in the world.  Very comfortable and, frankly, cool.  In the case of REDMOND SkyDew 3310S, you can start the process of moistening the apartment, say, on the way home from vacation.  Arrived - and the apartment has a comfortable atmosphere!  Whatever you say, but in the case of a humidifier, remote launch via the Internet is a very useful thing. <br><br>  I suspect that far from every apartment there is an extra smartphone lying around.  Alternatively, you can consider REDMOND Gateway, a product of cooperation between REDMOND and MTS.  For 3,500 rubles, you get a 4-inch smartphone with a SIM card installed and a REDMOND Smart Home tariff.  Calls and SMS are disabled by default, the fee is 10 rubles per month for 5 MB of traffic, which is enough to manage a fleet of up to 10 smart devices.  Although if you wish, you can easily find a smartphone for 2,000 rubles.  For your information, in the case of buying one Sky-series, the Gateway phone will cost you almost 3,000 rubles, two - 1,750 rubles.  If you buy as many as three gadgets at once, the smartphone will be given free of charge altogether. <br><br>  The REDMOND SkyDew 3310S has three modes of operation: Standard, Auto, and Sleep.  The first one is the most convenient and, so to speak, complete: you can change all the parameters, namely, set the moisture level, specify the desired moisture level, turn on the ‚ÄúMild moisture‚Äù option, activate the ‚ÄúTurbo‚Äù option to maximize the moisture level.  In general, the ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù allows you to choose the optimal settings for a specific situation.  This is the mode I use almost always, it also opens by default in the mobile application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08a/99c/069/08a99c069ba344fa800a382584f24c69.png"><br><br>  In ‚ÄúAuto‚Äù, only a couple of options are available for editing, and the ‚ÄúSleep‚Äù mode does not offer any settings at all.  The average moisture intensity is automatically set, the sleep timer starts after 8 hours.  That is, it is supposed to work during the sleep of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù duration.  On weekdays, I barely make it to 7 o'clock, and on weekends I sometimes jump for 12 hours, so, if anything, I prefer to set the timer in other modes manually :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db5/dc2/2fa/db5dc22fafeb45128b7edd4948976ac4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/152/0ea/a1f/1520eaa1fe394787adaa04434977bfdc.png"><br><br>  Regarding the quality of work REDMOND SkyDew 3310S.  It suited me one hundred percent: indeed, after a couple of hours of ‚Äúhovering‚Äù the device in my modest home, it became noticeably more pleasant.  That is, I even somehow did not think about what kind of dry air there actually was.  And with the help of REDMOND SkyDew, the 3310S realized that it could be much better.  In my estimation, an apartment of 60 square meters.  m is humidified at a rate of approximately 10% per hour, depending on the set speed.  One tank is enough for about 8-9-10 hours of operation.  As you know, the most ‚Äúdry‚Äù period in apartments is the winter period, when the full program batteries ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù moisture from the air.  Therefore, the work of a humidifier is much more, but it will be necessary to fill in water less often in comparison with a typical device with a two-three-liter tank. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Humidifier - one of those things that you think about not immediately.  For example, for newborns the presence of a humidifier at home (especially in winter) is mast hev, this unit has almost all young parents among my friends.  Also, this technique is very important if you (like me) mainly work at home.  Yes, so enthusiastically, that sometimes you forget to simply air the room, or even go out for a walk outside.  In the end, a humidifier is useful in order to prevent the most unpleasant effects of low humidity on health. <br><br>  Who would be interested in REDMOND SkyDew 3310S?  This model should be considered primarily by owners of large apartments, especially with a modern layout with impressive spaces.  For example, in the photo - almost 70-meter hall of a three-room Moscow apartment.  Agree, a small two-liter humidifier is not enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b6/a54/e3a/8b6a54e3aeee4467992942b7690bfbc4.jpeg"><br><br>  In the same conditions, the ability to remotely control from a smartphone is especially useful.  After all, it‚Äôs far from the fact that the optimal installation location will be near your sofa / chair or desk.  Moreover, in the case of REDMOND SkyDew 3310S, one hardly has to overpay for advanced functionality and the ability to run a humidifier at least a hundred kilometers from the apartment.  Models of other manufacturers with similar characteristics (without any smart functions) will cost an average of 5,000 rubles more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402291/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402291/</a></p>
