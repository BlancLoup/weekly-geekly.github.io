But now it turns out that serious costs will be borne not by large, but by small providers.  Large operators can partially recoup the costs and <b>even make a profit</b> by providing paid services to small operators, Kommersant <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3731064">reports</a> . <br><br>  Federal telecom operators are preparing to provide regional data storage services.  For example, MegaFon is considering this opportunity.  Representatives of the operator said that they receive a lot of requests from regional companies with a request to outsource the data.  Now they are invited to specify the network parameters, including the number of subscribers, incoming and outgoing traffic, peak load and forecast for these indicators at the end of 2019 - based on the collected statistics, Megafon calculates the feasibility of providing services and tariffs for hosting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By law, from July 1, operators must keep all telephone conversations of subscribers, SMS and electronic messages of users for six months, and from October 1 - all Internet traffic of subscribers for 30 days, including encrypted and video traffic.

      The possibility of outsourcing is considered by MTS and Rostelecom.  The latter has already <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/08/02/777223-rostelekom-pomozhet">decided to</a> keep negotiations and traffic of Tele2 subscribers, as it owns 45% of its shares.  Similar requests are received by the Akado provider.  The issue of providing hosting services to small operators is discussed at Transtelecom. <br><br>  Possible monthly incomes of Rostelecom from renting data centers to other operators can amount to at least hundreds of millions of rubles, <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/08/02/777223-rostelekom-pomozhet">says</a> Denis Kuskov, general director of Telecom Daily. <br><br>  Director General of Norsi-Trans Company (one of the manufacturers of certified solutions for SORM and the Yarovoi Law) Sergei Ovchinnikov explained that large operators can provide two types of service, partial or full outsourcing of data storage: ‚ÄúWith partial small operators, you will systems for the removal and storage of voice traffic, and storage of content can be provided to large operators. "  The cost will be calculated depending on the network settings. <br><br>  However, all market participants make a reservation that certified equipment is not yet on the market.  Although it is approximately known what it will be for iron and what its cost is, but the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media has not yet issued an order for its certification.  In addition, it is important to obtain permission from the Federal Security Service for full outsourcing: ‚ÄúThe emergence of such services from major operators is expected,‚Äù Ovchinnikov explained.  - But in the case of small regional companies, the question is whether they have to keep internal traffic or only external.  If the FSB decides that it is necessary to keep the internal one, in any case, you will have to install your own equipment. ‚Äù <br><br>  Prices for data storage services from large telecom operators are difficult to predict.  On the one hand, tariffs for regular hosting services in data centers are known.  On the other hand, here we are talking about a ‚Äúspecialized service‚Äù that complies with new legislation and uses certified equipment.  Owners of ordinary data centers cannot offer this service to customers.  That is, large operators have the opportunity to use the ‚Äúmonopoly‚Äù position and set prices above the market. <br><br>  However, small operators have no way out.  Even higher prices are more profitable for them than the deployment of full-scale own data storage systems.  Now the system of operational investigative activities (SORM) for the "Spring Law" is offered for 19 million rubles.  for 10 Gbit / s traffic, said General Director "OrderCom" Dmitry Galushko. <br><br>  Most likely, the monthly payment for small operators for storage on outsourcing may be lower than if they implemented such solutions themselves: ‚ÄúLarge operators will be able to recoup the costs of increasing storage and may even make a profit,‚Äù said a commentary. "Kommersant". <br><br>  The president of Rostelecom, Mikhail Oseevsky, repeatedly stressed that ‚Äúnobody earns money on the law of Spring, everyone will lose everything,‚Äù and the provision of services to small companies will only partially compensate for losses.  However, some independent experts believe that renting infrastructure for rent will still allow to go to zero. <br><br>  Thus, the beneficiaries of the ‚ÄúSpring Law‚Äù will be a limited number of companies.  First of all, these are suppliers of certified solutions for SORM that need to be integrated into data centers in accordance with the ‚ÄúSpring Law‚Äù.  Secondly, these are large operators who, although they are investing in the expansion of data centers, will be able to recoup these investments at the expense of small operators. <br><br>  In other words, the main part of the cost of executing the ‚ÄúLaw of Spring‚Äù falls on regional operators.  They are considered as donors of the storage system, said Oleg Grishchenko, president of the Rosteleset association.  In addition, he expressed doubt that the developers of SORM will be able to create systems for processing such a volume of data.  Now installed SORM-2 often do not work, as manufacturers can not properly configure them. <br><blockquote>  <b>A warning at the request of the site administration:</b> ‚ÄúWhen commenting on this material, please follow the rules.
