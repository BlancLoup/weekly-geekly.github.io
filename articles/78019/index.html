Have the operators leaked the subscriber base or was there a leak? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The call was today at about 9 pm, on Friday ... obviously they did not call from the office, I think the students are outsourced. <br>  Dialogue with a young man (M) was like this: <br>  M: Hello Name Patronymic, we would like to ask you some questions about the quality of Internet services and cable television. <br>  I: Hello, on behalf of which provider are you calling?  (we have 3 large ones in Perm, I have an agreement with everyone) <br>  M: I am not from an operator, but from an independent research company for researching the quality of service! <br>  I: Do you know that the information you possess is personal data? <br>  M: What is such personal data? <br>  Me: Well, the last name, first name, telephone number - at a minimum, this is personal data according to the <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2006/07/29/personaljnye-dannye-dok.html">law on personal data</a> . <br>  M: Come on, they can all be easily found in the database throughout Perm.  (A database with personal data of Perm residents and regions was illegally released in the region of 2000: name, address, passport number, date of birth, registration, cars and other info) <br>  Me: And where do you have information about me personally? <br>  M: Well, we have it in the database. <br>  Me: Do you have information about subscribers of all Perm providers in the database? <br>  M: Well, yes, sort of <br>  Me: Ok, you wanted to know if I was satisfied with the quality of the services?  Yes, I am satisfied, I now have FPIC.

      The boy quickly said goodbye and hung up. <br><br>  So, the call arrived on the home phone number, which was specified in combination with my full name in at least two places: <br><ul><li>  FPIC Agreement </li><li>  Merged base in 2000 </li></ul><br><br>  The phone number that was called was not registered to me. <br><br>  Has anyone come across this?  Does an internet-operator have the right to merge info on subscribers of another ‚Äúindependent company‚Äù that will merge it to someone else? <br><br>  The text of the contract with the provider will try to find and post.  Detailing on the phone with the number of the caller will also try to get it. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : I called the internet provider, they said that they provide information about subscribers to paying agents (for example, "free cash").  The list of data provided includes: name, address, subscriber information.  We were advised to drive to the office and write a statement to the security service of the provider. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78019/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78019/</a></p>
