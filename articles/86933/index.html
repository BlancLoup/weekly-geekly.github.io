      <b>Legend:</b> <br>  - Phrase third-party hero <br>  * Phrase protagonist <br>  * No sign * - thoughts of the main character <br><br>  <b>Chapter 1. Part 2: Street</b> <br><br>  So, I went out into the street and immediately stepped into a puddle, without noticing it with aching and agglutinated eyes.  Hell, after all, again at school they will call them ‚Äúred-eyed‚Äù, and yet this redness is already so ingrained that it is not going to leave, even eye drops do not help.  And to hell ... <br>  Plus, the neck hurts, most likely it was blown from the open window, which yesterday was so lazily to close, and in fact all you had to do was to tear the ass off the chair and walk 2 meters.  Damn it, how shameful it is sometimes for what you did in the past.  And again, even thinking about your mistakes, once again you commit them day after day.  After all, I understand that this is impossible, but I still continue to do ... <br>  - Hello. <br>  * And hello to you, Sasha. <br>  Hmm, Sasha is late today, and after all such a diligent student.  Of course, he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me, like everyone else, because it‚Äôs not interesting to talk to me, they don‚Äôt care what happened yesterday in Counter-Strike that I did a jump for the first time or that Worms defeated an opponent with just one worm, despite that he had a whole team of them.  Give them a sport and a healthy lifestyle, and they quietly drink beer and smoke cigarettes, although I have never even tried it in my life.  In general, I feel better when I'm alone, no one asks questions and does not teach how to live ... <br>  But on the horizon appeared a blue school building, a building similar to the Latin letter H. How I hate this place!  A place where you are loaded with a huge amount of information is constantly being demanded and forced to live by their rules!  This is more like a prison, except for those lessons that I like, and they can be counted on the fingers: computer science, mathematics, Russian.  And everything else is a waste of time and a dispersion of thoughts.  How can I hate you school.  But a little more, only 2 years old and I can leave you.  And now ... take me in your cold embrace ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86933/</a></p>
