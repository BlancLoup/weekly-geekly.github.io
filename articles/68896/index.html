Contact the organizers and the map is known.  From the subway is not very far.  The venue is decent.  Normal tables and chairs.  Three Wi-Fi networks for event participants.  For all the time the Internet has never fallen.  Twice a day they brought food.  Quality food from the dining room and pizzeria.  There were always two hot water coolers and Greenfield tea.  Of course, there were Cola, Fanta etc.

      Master Classes  It's all good too.  There were a lot of interesting things.  I have learned a lot of new things.  In truth, I drove it for this.  IMHO practice was not enough.  Of course, I did not attend all master classes, as they went in two streams.  I think the parts for mobile devices (iPhone, Android) practice was more.  In any case, both groups of developers presented the final product of their work.  As for the ‚Äústart-up kit‚Äù flow, which included stories about Grails, RoR, Git and Amazon EC2, there was not enough practice.  Nevertheless, I am very grateful to all the speakers.  Since their stories gave me the necessary set of knowledge for further digging and self-development.  I would like to hear about programming techniques such as "Extreme Programming". <br><br>  Commands.  Before HackDay, only 3-4 projects were announced.  who collected the team.  When it was time to gather a team on the spot, it seemed to me that there are more people who have an idea than people who are ready to be engaged in implementation.  There were a lot of projects, and the most different.  There was a development for the iPhone and Android, semantic analyzers, there were even LEGO robots that can be programmed. <br><br>  The working process.  After the master classes and the "natural selection" of projects, work began on the implementation of these.  There is nothing special to tell.  All teams scattered around the adjacent premises.  Someone remained in the main hall.  From time to time, all gathered in the hall for eating.  I myself decided to implement my project in PHP at home, and then join the Python time tracking project for GoogleApps.  I must say that neither I nor my colleague had ever written to Python before.  Perhaps this is why by the evening 10% of our plans were ready, and we were no longer able to write anything. <br><br>  HackFest.  The logical end of HackDay was HackFest - presentations of implemented projects.  Those that remember.  Robots from LEGO Mindstorms.  One marker draws for HackDay.  Another scorpion robot stings those.  Who is approaching from the front.  Semantic analyzer of their Helsinki guys.  It can build DOM-like models of sentences, find synonyms of words in a sentence.  It can be distinguished by homonyms (key in the lock, king in the lock).  A simpler linguistic analyzer for a linguistic girl and a small Java command.  It can take streams of your records from LiveJournal and determine what you care most about at a specific time.  It reminded the pulse of the blogosphere, only more individually.  An application to search for trains for the iPhone.  An application to synchronize your Android phonebook and vkontakte.ru.  Aggregator of information about fashion from various sources.  There was even a browser strategy.  If anyone forgot, write, add. <br><br>  Common moments that I singled out for myself.  Of all the projects there was not a single desktop.  All under WEB or mobile platforms.  Many services that are aimed at providing information to the user individually.  Our habralent 3.0 is also such an application. <br><br>  Official site: <a href="http://hackday.ru/">hackday.ru</a> . <br><br>  UPD.  Transferred to the blog "Learn to work."  I hope no one is against it. <br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68896/</a></p>
