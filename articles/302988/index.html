Impressions of them, of course, was the sea, and one of my colleagues, Alexander Abdullayev, a team leader from the Veeam ONE development team, among other things, was favorably smiled by fortune.  His brief, but very positive report on events read under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ced/9b9/59e/ced9b959e91445ae93797fce90708b9e.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hello!

      I decided to write a small review about the last Microsoft DevCon 2016 conference (May 25-26). <br>  I attended this conference for the first time.  When almost a thousand people gather for 2 days to exchange information in one area - this, of course, is impressive!  The format of the event itself (and this is the venue, the number of participants, and, as a result, the concentration of knowledge, technology, experience, gadgets, common interests) is well thought out and contributes to the best perception of thematic information: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71c/c5d/2ee/71cc5d2eef9847d99119d1c2fc97cdaf.jpg"><br><br>  The conference had a huge number of reports, master classes, tracks, experts, etc.  in the area in which we all work with you.  I wanted to go everywhere, but I had to choose one thing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c7/835/21d/7c783521d064495c94b7bdf5b8ff7ac9.jpg"><br><br>  I am sure everyone who attended this conference received a lot of impressions. <br>  Maxim told me about computer vision and those incredible things that are happening now in the field of pattern recognition. <br>  The novel shared its impressions of Azure and a large part of Linux systems in the cloud, looking to the future where the operating systems will be free and the code is open. <br>  Sasha and Sylvester enthusiastically told that in extjs there is an automatic binding of the front-end to the back-end and that, perhaps, we no longer have to do automatic copying of pages. <br>  I myself was impressed with IoT, Power BI, microcomputers, and other interesting topics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ce/079/19c/6ce07919c67e49d2b0a9639ca69069bc.jpg"><br><br>  After the conference, personally, I wanted ‚Äúall at once‚Äù, something I have already done, and there is an unfading desire to move forward in further knowledge of various areas of information technology. <br><br><h1>  And now the story of how I won the X-Box One </h1><br><br>  During the two days of the conference was held quest.  Of the more than 800 participants in the conference, more than 350 people participated in the quest! <br>  It was necessary to perform various tasks (there were only 12), for example, visit a key report, publish a photo in instagram with a quote from the report and certain hashtags, or go to the Intel counter, talk with representatives, answer various questions and get a code word, with which it was necessary to go to the technological exhibition, find the ‚Äújuzverej‚Äù there, solve its problem and get a fragment of the binary code. <br>  Thus, performing various tasks, it was necessary to collect 8 pieces of binary code, decrypt them (translation of 8 bytes to ASCII characters) and learn the phrase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fee/6e5/6cd/fee6e56cd2e443bcb2411d7f0fb49e2a.jpg"><br><br>  In the process of deciphering, a ‚Äúbug‚Äù was revealed in a message, which was reported to the organizers.  Decoding was continued from the end of the phrase and docked at the place of discrepancy :).  This incident probably played a key role in determining the winner.  And in the evening of the second day, in the largest hall, with the accumulation of a huge number of people began to announce the winners, starting with the 10th place.  I really hoped to take at least some place in 10k (after all, as we hoped, I was the first to manage to get to the bottom of the code).  And now called the 3rd place, 2nd, but my name was not.  There was 1 place left ... Who is the winner? <br>  And when the presenter announced the 1st place and the projectors brought my name and surname to the big screen - there was no limit to joy and delight!  ))) Guys, thanks for the support and for believing in me !!!  And, of course, I thank Veeam for this opportunity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63b/f21/4ac/63bf214ac96f4c02b42c2bcd082da631.jpg"><br><br>  In the photo, the happy winner of the prize (and it was <a href="http://www.xbox.com/ru-RU/xbox-one/consoles/1TB-the-division-bundle">http://www.xbox.com/en-RU/xbox-one/consoles/1TB-the-division-bundle</a> ) and the Veeam development team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302988/</a></p>
