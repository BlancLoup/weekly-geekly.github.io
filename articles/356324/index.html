      Xerox as a device is formally not either, does it somehow hurt you? <br><br>  Having installed any Linux distribution, the user enters a familiar GNU environment with the same kernel and software, eliminating some distro-specific features.  And what is this, if not the OS. <br><br>  Why does a person who installs Windows himself have the right not to specify which distribution he puts on, and Linux users are denied this right? <br><br>  As a user, it is more convenient for me to say ‚ÄúI have installed Linux myself‚Äù, this is how I feel.  Whatever distribution kit I put, in the case of jambs, I will go for advice on the arch and gentoo wiki just because it is one OS, and the users of the mentioned distros usually offer a well-thought-out solution, rather than a method found. <br><br>  Exaggerating, let us say - having a busybox and a package manager and / or means for building packages, any Linux distribution can be turned into any other one precisely because this is one OS, Linux or GNU / Linux is the tenth question. <br><br><h4>  The essence of GNU / Linux is freedom, cruel and merciless </h4><br>  It all starts with freedom, and sometimes there is a wild desire to have this freedom less. <br><br>  For example, take the OS boot. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">quote:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Besides the fact that we already have Debian GNU / Linux installed, it should somehow run.  Rather, someone must run it.  Together with Debian comes the universal OS loader - GRUB.  Grub can run not only Linux, but any operating system that supports the multiboot protocol ‚Äî freebsd, netbsd, openbsd, any Linux + GNU, or you can do it without GNU.  In addition, Grub can run MacOS and Windows without multiboot. <br><br>  Briefly about all the GNU / Linux boot steps: <br><br>  BIOS - boot boot loader <br><br>  boot-loader 512 bytes - loads grub <br><br>  GRUB - loads the kernel and initramfs <br><br>  The kernel is looking for and starting equipment <br><br>  initramfs (/ sbin / init) prepares everything to start the OS <br><br>  Change Root to a real system <br><br>  / sbin / init present system runs programs <br><br>  We see a login greeting (one of the programs launched in step 7, for example gdm) </blockquote><br></div></div><br><br>  The author of the quote did not specify, but in this list each line has alternatives up to: UEFI loads the kernel without initramfs with the shell as init.  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/piromanlynx/" class="user_link">piromanlynx</a> where intermediate stages disappeared? <br><br>  Here on the loaders we illustrate freedom. <br><br>  Freedom in Linux works like this: ‚ÄúThe user is your choice of GRUB, GRUB Legacy, PXELINUX, SYSLINUX, ELILO, LILO, a pack of lesser-known ones.  Googled differences and choose one thing. "  And from that moment the flour of choice begins, and the choice is worth it.  In most cases, it is the right choice that determines the comfort of using your Linux. <br><br>  For example, the GRUB2 mentioned in the article is a combine that can load most of the bootable media in nature - up to the disk image, accompanying all this wealth with beautiful pictures and in between, make a cup of coffee for the user.  Lilo is able to boot the OS from any FS and SYSLINUX, which lies in one file and just works. <br><br>  And based on the requirements, the user chooses his own, or a small SYSLINUX for a minimalist system, or a universal GRUB, with this begins the way to create his own unique system.  That's the difference, the beauty and the curse of Linux - each installation is unique. <br><br>  Freedom in Linux is so comprehensive that it allows you to reshape any part according to your own understanding and shoot yourself a head, thereby hanging a gun on the wall, believe it always hangs there. <br><br><h4>  The second aspect that characterizes Linux is simplicity. </h4><br>  Most issues are resolved with the advice ‚ÄúJust edit the config‚Äù.  The Linux world is a world where text files are the keys of power, and a text editor is the absolute power ring, a powerful artifact of an alien mind.  An alien mind is not a metaphor, it is the impression left by the first launch of vi. <br><br>  Linux is ingeniously simple - it fascinates and captivates to such an extent that you involuntarily start changing something, adjust the UI to optimize boot time, change kernel options ... ‚ÄúWhere do tales of tambourines and‚Äú sex with Linux ‚Äùcome from? A rhetorical question. <br><br><h4>  Tambourine and red eyes </h4><br>  Most of them are attributes that depend solely on their own desires, and habits.  In Linux, freedom and for most of the tasks you can google a windows solution - install Gui, who will do everything.  It may not do quite that, and not exactly, but if you search hard, you will be able to find even a paid tool that is so dear to users of Windows, because what keeps on Windows is not an obligation to pay for everything. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustrative example:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The man put Mint calls me and asks how to turn on the sound 7.1 on the offer to look in Google shakes off that everything is scary. <br><br>  Scary so scared, becoming interested, I went to google there offers to shovel almost all the pulse configs or at least to rebuild it with my presets. <br><br>  And all you had to do was start AlsaMixer and choose the number of channels, or the same in the sound settings. <br></div></div><br>  Simply put, in Linux, the user has the right to choose: put a tick on it or rebuild the package so that there is no need for a tick. <br><br>  Of course, there are issues that can not be solved without a tambourine, but on their home PC, as a rule, there is a minimum of them. <br><br>  The difference between Windows and Linux in this regard in the following on Linux after googling you will understand what hand to hold the tambourine and do everything yourself with a couple of commands, <br><br>  Under Windows you will find a utility that will do everything itself for the miserable 40 parrots. <br><br><h4>  Linux is a console </h4><br>  Yes, and a thousand times yes, unlike Windows, nobody hides it here.  There live find, cat, echo, grep, awk, sed, who said mc (netrw for vim and get your two-pane manager), all these miracle utilities make it easy to do tedious and monotonous work.  The console is there and it is very useful. <br><br>  And when Oblaco@Mail.Ru sarcastically told me that it wouldn‚Äôt synchronize 300GB of files, because some names contain spaces and other pornography, I got off with one line in the console to bring everything to standards. <br><br>  In fact, an ordinary user sees the console only by chance and it is of little interest to him that instead of half an hour of crying, you can enter just one command. <br><br><h4>  It's easy to shoot yourself in Linux </h4><br>  Easily dd if = / dev / zero of = / dev / sdx and there is no Linux.  Both shot and healed.  For the sake of justice, where you can really shoot a leg, you need not only to press "yes". <br><br>  It looks like this: <br><br>  hdparm --fwdownload file.lod --yes-i-know-what-i-am-doing --please-destroy-my-drive / dev / sdx <br><br>  After such input it would be foolish to say that you were not warned about the insecurity of flashing the drive, wouldn‚Äôt it? <br><br><h4>  Linux users are better protected because they install all of the repositories. </h4><br>  Unfortunately, this is a myth.  It is too simple to install the left bun, the same cloud mentioned above initially went to the binary and was launched by a double click.  Yes, and many people who do a lot of good are so busy that they cannot assemble a package for the distribution kit and offer to download the script from the site, Vestacp is an example of this.  What encourages the addiction to run unknown because they do not understand where. <br><br>  Although, I like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe script, from the site if the linux version is absolutely indifferent to this script, unfortunately such scripts are rarely found. <br><br><h4>  There are no viruses under Linux </h4><br>  Alas, under Linux there is a flash, java, browser, which is a self-contained execution environment and they don‚Äôt care what they are.  Accordingly, written for them will work everywhere.  Yes, it all works from the user, but in order to get the root, it is enough to write one file in the user's directory, which sometimes executes sudo.  Have you seen your ~ / .bash_aliases long? <br><br><h4>  P.S </h4><br>  Linux is simpler than Windows, Linux is more understandable than Windows, Linux is more secure than Windows (as is commonly believed).  Let's be fair: the main factor not to install Linux is still the argument ‚Äúunder windows more toys‚Äù. <br><br>  And, unfortunately, Linux is becoming more and more like Windows. <br><br>  Already there is its own registry, and duplicate settings, and behavior a la "I am the system, I know better what you need."  In general, wondering whether to try intoxicating freedom and permissiveness in a hurry to try, but you may not have time.  Slowly and surely, Ubuntu is on its way to OSX and pulling the rest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356324/</a></p>
