  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Spout: "There is no blogging"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Friday I was at InfoCom-2007.  I am writing about it so late because I spent the Sabbath day in the woods, winning over the bridgehead from the Germans to further attack Budapest. <br><br>  By the beginning of the exhibition, I was godlessly late, having missed the opening of the ‚ÄúSchool of Internet‚Äù and the awarding of the winner of the ‚ÄúBest IT Blog‚Äù competition.  The reasons are huge queues for buses going to and past the exhibition, the exorbitant appetites of taxi drivers demanding 1000 r.  for delivery, traffic jams, and not very successful registration procedure for participants. <br><br>  I was even late for a report from the representative of ROCIT on the state of the Russian Internet.  However, in this case, almost did not miss anything, because the information on which the report was based, one way or another, is in the public domain, and it's time to get used to making conclusions on their own. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After the end of the report, we went to inspect the exhibition.  To be honest, I was not impressed - but this is due to the lack of special interest in any stand.  The interest was caused only by the mock-up projects of the ‚Äútechnological towns‚Äù and the organization of communications at the Olympic Games in Sochi.  I was struck by the pavilion, where Chinese companies were exhibited - with an abundance of hieroglyphs, bored Chinese, products amazingly resembling the products of famous companies and a small number of visitors.

      The next speakers of the ‚ÄúSchool of the Internet‚Äù were representatives of the classmates.ru site.  They told about how the site was created by the efforts of two people, how quick success came - 1 million users over half a year of work (currently over 5 million), what additions do we expect on the site in the future (here, however, the speakers were secretive , and voiced only two: the section "Celebrities on the site" and paid sms-services).  At the end of the report, viewers were given badges, and invited to the round table ‚ÄúBlogs, social networks ... what's next?‚Äù, Which was the object of my interests. <br><br>  The presenter of the round table was the famous Alex Exler, and in the participants were expected representatives of ROCIT, Liveinternet, SUPA, classmates, rambler and diary.ru.  They were expected, because half of the participants could not arrive, and the representative of mail.ru, who turned out to be in the hall (unfortunately he did not remember his name), refused to go to the ‚Äúpresidium‚Äù.  As a result, sat at the table: Nosik Anton (SUP), Kulikova Nana (classmates.ru), Shubina Olesya (diary.ru) and Exler himself.  To my surprise, there were also a few spectators - about twenty to thirty people. <br><br>  Therefore, in my opinion, the round table did not work out - it turned out to be a little small party.  Classmates asked something for the SUP, the SUP for the Diary, etc.  All the efforts of the presenter did not move away from the topic, they were not crowned with success: the participants inevitably slipped into a polemic of the type: ‚Äúwhat about you?‚Äù. <br><br>  However, it still turned out funny and interesting. <br>  Shubina Olesya was noted for a joke: ‚Äúthe whole team is in Krasnodar, only I and the server work in Moscow‚Äù, and told the audience about the development plans: paid accounts, an extensive advertising campaign offline.  A representative of Diary.ru also voiced the dominant user segment - 70% of girls under 20 years of age. <br><br>  Nose shone the most.  He walked around competitors, saying, answering a question about the audience of various blogging systems, that ‚Äúonly LJ has an audience,‚Äù the rest have only users.  He "drew" and the average user LJ - 25 years old, a man with a higher education, a professional in his business - is very different from the average portrait of a Russian blogger (female student, 21 years old). <br><br>  On the popular question of monetization of blogs lately, Nosik and Shubina unanimously expressed that users of LiveJournal and Diary will not receive any money. <br><br>  The question of political agitation was also raised, which is not surprising in the run-up to the elections.  Shubin said that there would be no political advertising.  Spout spoke softer, saying that if the ad will comply with the law, he does not see the reasons hindering its placement.  Nosik spoke positively about the trials: ‚Äúit‚Äôs good that they are being dragged to court‚Äù.  In his opinion, this trend will only improve the blogosphere, and increase the culture of communication. <br><br>  <em>I will allow myself a small UPD, prompted by the Spout itself, about litigation.</em>  <em>Apparently my ear hooked on the phrase, but the meaning did not come to mind, in the original it sounded like this: <strong>It‚Äôs good that people who can adequately defend themselves are brought to court: billionaire deputy Lebedev, an officer and lawyer Shirinkin, me.</strong></em>  <em><strong>Precedents must be created by the forces of the defendants who can stand up for themselves.</strong></em> <br><br>  The provocative phrase stated in the title was also spoken by Nosik, but that's the problem, I don‚Äôt remember for what reason. <br><br>  So the question that worried me - ‚Äúwhat's next?‚Äù Was not disclosed.  It's a pity. <br><br>  PS And Spout is so funny :) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15506/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15506/</a></p>
