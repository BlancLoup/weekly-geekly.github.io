  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Underwater snake</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  (This is a real, but scary and horrible story for the night. Well, after reading, someone might have an idea to use the ‚ÄúUnderwater Snake‚Äù as a character for 3D games) <br>  From ancient times to the present day, myths, legends and tales about unusual snakes, dragons and monsters that once lived on our planet are transmitted in various parts of the planet.  Many people know the icon: "The Miracle of St. George and the Dragon."  In the legend of St. George the Victory, real events occurring on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea are reported. <br>  In the V century AD, during the reign of Emperor Diocletian, in Capodpocia, there lived a young Christian from a noble family.  Having learned that a giant serpent appeared in the district, who was abducting people, George set off.  Having found the serpent, he prayerfully, with a spear hits the serpent and rescues the daughter of the local ruler.  After their accomplishment, the majority of the population of the city accepts Christianity. <br>  Giant snakes and dragons are mentioned in the writings of Aristotle, Euripides, Pliny, Seneca, and Procopius of Caesarea.  In the writings of Procopius of Caesarea, a historian who lived in the sixth century, the following events are described: "Near Constantinople, in the waters of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMarmara, a huge monster was caught, drowning ships for many years and killing people in coastal waters."  Another Christian hero, St. Theodore Stratilates, kills a giant serpent near the city of Hercules (port of Eregli - Turkey). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many people know the legend of Laocone and his children, who were killed by giant snakes that came out of the sea - this event occurred during the Trojan War. <br>  In Russian epics, one of the main characters is the Serpent Gorynych, which, as a rule, annoyed the locals very much. <br>  The chronicles tell that Jerome Gorsey, an agent of an English trading company, in 1589, saw a huge animal on the bank of a river, which was killed by the villagers.  This animal looked like a huge lizard, more than three meters long. <br>  The full collection of Russian chronicles (t. 30) states: ‚ÄúIn the summer of 7090/1582 / in Novgorod, the foundations of korokodily lutia animals from the river and the way of shutter, people and the gods of God all around the Earth, and many of the gods, hide and rest. beating. " <br>  Vladimir Monomakh in his book ‚ÄúInstructions‚Äù describes a strange animal: ‚ÄúTo Lutia, the beast jumped onto my thighs and horse with me more horribly.‚Äù In the annals this animal is called ‚ÄúCorcodile‚Äù.  What is interesting in the annals, the mention of "korkodilah", is found without any explanation, which suggests that this beast was well known and did not need additional explanations. <br>  The history of the founding of the Polish city of Krakow is interesting. <br>  Under the Wawel Hill there lived a serpent that devoured people.  This snake was killed by the Pole Krak, who founded the city.  Krakow stands on the Vistula River, i.e.  on the same river, on the bank of which Jerome Gersay saw a dead crocodile. <br>  In October 1997, the auxiliary ship of the Navy KChF ‚ÄúMB-304‚Äù was drifting north-west of the island of Cyprus.  First-class sailor Alexei Ryzhov was on the bridge.  Suddenly, three hundred meters from the vessel, he saw a dark object, which was approaching the vessel in wave-like movements.  Fifty meters from the side, a huge snake's head appeared from the water, which rose two meters out of the water.  The diameter of the head was 35-40 centimeters, the color is dark, the length of the animal was more than 12 meters.  Snake turned his head toward the ship.  Alexey loudly shouted: "Snake!".  The captain of the vessel, Vitaly Kozhakin, who ran out onto the bridge, saw only a tail that had disappeared under water. <br>  In Crimea, legends and tales of giant snakes and monsters have been known for a very long time.  In 1958, in the Pavlovsky Kurgan, on the ridge Yuz-Oba, near Kerch, the archeologist A. Lutsenko discovered the burial of a girl.  Among the many precious jewelry found a gold ring.  It was depicted a huge sea serpent surrounded by fish.  This ring was made back in 350 BC. <br>  In the legends of the Crimea there is a legend that in the cave on Kachi-Kalona there were huge monsters that kept all the local population in fear.  One day, a young Christian girl, Anastasia, was herding sheep on the slopes of Kachi-Kalona.  Suddenly, a monster jumped out of the cave, grabbing a sheep with its paws and beginning to drag it to the rocks.  Anastasia was not scared, with a prayer she rushed to the caves.  The monsters surrounded her and began to torment her.  Anastasia of the last of her strength struck herself with the sign of the cross, and stones fell from the arches of the rocks, burying both the girl and the monsters beneath.  The next day, the amazed residents saw that the rock was crying - the water from the grotto was seeping like tears.  Subsequently, at the foot of the Kachi-Kalona Anastasievsky skete was built, which existed until the 20s of our century. <br>  In the Tatar legend ‚ÄúCherschambe‚Äù it is said that giant snakes lived near the village of Otouzy (Shchebetovka) in the town of Yulanchik.  The local Khan even specially summoned the Janissaries from Istanbul, who killed the snake, but in the legend it is mentioned that his cubs survived. <br>  In the 18th century, in the rocks near Chufut-Kale, there lived a huge snake devouring people and animals.  The local Christians began to offer prayers to the Most Holy Theotokos.  One night, people saw a fire in one of the grottoes.  When they came to the rocks in the morning, they found a burning candle in the grotto, which stood in front of the image of the Most Holy Theotokos, and a dead serpent lay nearby.  Subsequently, this icon became the shrine of the Assumption Monastery. <br>  V. Kh. Kondaraki in his book ‚ÄúUniversal Description of the Crimea‚Äù informs that in 1828 Yevpatoriysky the police officer submitted a report in which he wrote that a huge serpent with a ‚Äúhare-head and likeness of a mane‚Äù appeared in the county.  The serpent attacked the sheep and sucked the blood out of them. <br>  In 1921, an article was published in the Feodossiya newspaper, stating that a "huge reptile" appeared in the sea under Kara-Dag.  To capture the snake, even a company of Red Army soldiers was sent, who, having arrived in Koktebel, found only a trace from the snake, which led to the sea.  Maximilian Voloshin sent a clipping about the "reptile" to Mikhail Bulgakov.  M. Bulgakov, having read the article, wrote the novel ‚ÄúFatal Eggs‚Äù, according to which the film was later shot. <br>  In the thirties, a fisherman from Kuchuk-Lambata (Small Lighthouse) met a huge serpent among the coastal cliffs.  He screamed in horror and, when people came running, he managed only to whisper: "dog's head".  Then he was paralyzed, and a month later the fisherman died. <br>  The most common giant snake is seen near Kara-Dag.  Writer Natalia Lesina told me that the snake, in September 1952, met V.K.  Zozulya, in 1967, in the fall - Lyudmila Szeged, L.P.  Pecherikina and many more residents of the villages of Koktebel and Ordzhonikidze. <br>  On May 14, 1952, the writer Vsevolod Ivanov was sitting on the shore in Karadag Bay Serdolikova Bay.  Suddenly, at fifty meters offshore, he saw something resembling a tangle of algae.  Suddenly this something began to unfold and lengthen.  A huge serpent appeared, 30 meters long and about a meter in diameter.  The lower part of the monster was white and the upper dark brown.  The monster, wriggling like all floating snakes, slowly swam towards the playing dolphins, which quickly began to move away into the open sea.  After a short swim, the serpent curled again into a ball, and the current carried it to the left.  In the middle of the bay, the serpent turned around again and raised its head, which looked like a dog.  Small eyes were visible.  For two minutes, the snakes swam with their heads raised, then abruptly turned around, put his head in the water and quickly retired behind the rocks of Serdolikova Bay.  Vsevolod Ivanov watched the Black Sea Bleka for more than forty minutes. <br>  In May 1961, the local fisherman, Mikhail Ivanovich Kondratyev, the director of the sanatorium Crimean Primorye, A. Mozhaysky, and the chief accountant of this enterprise, V. Vostokov, went out to sea in the morning on a boat to go fishing.  Departing from the pier of the Karadag Biological Station, they turned to the left, towards the Golden Gate.  Suddenly, 300 meters from the shore, they saw a brown spot under the water, which was about sixty meters away.  Began to approach him, but it began to move away from them.  When they approached this underwater object at a distance of about 50 meters, they discovered that something huge and terrible had appeared above the water.  Three meters from the surface of the water was visible the head of a huge snake, the size of which was about one meter.  The entire surface of the head was covered with brown spaces, similar to algae.  On the body, behind the head, the horn plates were clearly visible.  The mane was just on the back.  The belly is gray.  Among the mane, in the upper part of the head, there were small eyes, from the gaze of which everyone was terrified by horror.  For a moment, the fishermen were numb.  Having overcome himself, Mikhail Kondratyev unfolded the boat and gave full speed.  They began to leave the Black Sea "Black Sea" to the shore.  The monster chased after them.  This race continued for several minutes.  At 100 meters from the shore, the Blake stopped, then turned and began to leave for the open sea.  The boat at full speed jumped ashore, and the fishermen ran screaming toward the biological station.  After this meeting, the fishermen did not go to sea for several days, fearing to meet the Black Sea Bleka again. <br>  In 1968, Mikhail Ivanovich Kondratyev again had to meet with his old "acquaintances".  One summer, he was returning from fishing.  Coming up on his felucca to the fishing nets, standing near the Karadag biostation, he suddenly saw a large brown spot under the water, about thirty meters away.  When Mikhail Ivanovich approached him at a distance of 15 meters, he saw the familiar outlines of a serpent.  Suddenly the water began to seethe, the head of a monster appeared, which disappeared under water in a moment.  At this place a whirlpool formed with a funnel, with a diameter of ten meters and a depth of about two meters.  Frightened, the fisherman gave full speed and the felucca rushed to the pier. <br>  On August 18, 1990, Moscow-based artist Alexander Kudryavtsev was fishing at night on the pier of the village of Planerskoe.  Suddenly he became very scared, he felt someone's glance on him.  Looking into the sea, he saw in the dark, at a height of about two meters above the water, two luminous eyes.  Numbly, he looked into those eyes for a few minutes, then jumped up and ran to the shore.  A few nights after that he had terrible dreams. <br>  On December 7, 1990, a dolphin measuring 230 cm got tangled in the dangling nets of fishermen. Pulling it to the surface, the fishermen discovered that the dolphin‚Äôs stomach was bitten by a single bite.  The bite width in an arc was about one meter.  Along the edge of the arc, on the skin of the dolphin, there were clearly visible traces of triangular teeth, the size of which was about 40 millimeters.  The distance between the tops of the teeth was 15-20 millimeters.  In total, 16 tracks from giant teeth were viewed.  The dolphin's belly was bitten with ribs, even the spine was visible.  The head of the animal was severely deformed, as if trying to drag it through a narrow hole.  Frightened, the fishermen cut the net with a dolphin and quickly left the area. <br>  In the spring of 1991, fishermen brought another dolphin with similar teeth marks on their bodies.  The brought dolphin was put in the refrigerator, but after a few days an accident occurred, the refrigerator froze and the corpse of the animal had to be thrown away. <br>  Following the footsteps of the teeth on the bodies of dolphins, it can be assumed that the length of the snake should be approximately thirty meters. <br>  In 1984, at one of the bentos PLBP 300 diving, in the northwestern part of the Black Sea, our hydronauts saw an unidentified animal under water at a depth of 80 meters, which crossed the PLB course and was viewed simultaneously from all the nasal portholes.  The width of the laboratory is six meters.  The unidentified animal passed over the nose of the PLB and was very large, more than 10 meters in size, but, unfortunately, the observers did not have time to examine and photograph it in detail.  Hydronauts ichthyologists could not determine the type of animal. <br>  Conducting studies of the Black Sea shelf zone, we made numerous dives at the Bentos-300 underwater laboratory. Oceanologists carried out a landscape survey of the sea floor from Batumi to Bourgas, at depths from 20 to 250 meters.  Unfortunately, at Kara-Dag, we had only one dive, and we did not meet the Black Sea ‚ÄúBlacks‚Äù, but at a depth of 80 meters we saw an old chest, covered with copper plates, in which there are probably treasures.  We did not lift the treasure chest, because we were going underwater towing. <br>  When working in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCape Kiik-Atlama, at depths of 50-100 meters, unusual formations were often encountered: volcanchuks, up to 60 cm high, rose on the ground every 10-15 meters. Similar formations were not found in other areas of the Black Sea. <br>  August 12, 1992. The employee of Theodosia executive committee V.M.  Belsky swam in a cove on the east coast of Cape Kiik-Atlama.  Swimming near the coast, he suddenly saw a monster's head 30 meters away from him.  The monster began to swim toward him.  Frightened, Vladimir Mikhailovich quickly swam to the shore.  Jumping ashore, he saw not far from his head the head of a huge snake, from whose mane water flowed.  The head in diameter was more than 50 cm, the neck is a little thinner.  Horny gray plates were clearly visible on the head and neck.  The eyes are small, the body is dark gray, the lower part is lighter.  A dark brown mane was waving in the middle of the head and on the back.  For a few moments, Belsky watched the monster, then ran into the village. <br>  A year before this meeting at the same place, a young man, a master of sports in swimming, died from a broken heart.  It can be assumed that he also met our Black Sea "Bleka". <br>  Correspondent of the Sudaksky Vestnik newspaper A.N.  Ovchinnikov also saw a huge snake frolicking in the sea.  From a twenty-meter height of Cape Frenchwoman, the correspondent watched as a flock of dolphins rushed away from this monster.  The animals in a panic swam away from the Blacks pursuing them. <br>  In the summer of 1996, the staff of the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas, ichthyologist Alexander Romanovich Boltachev and the parasitologist Machkevsky Vladimir Konstantinovich, at 22 o'clock, walked along the coast from the Golden Gate towards the Karadag Biological Station.  The moon was bright.  Suddenly, 10 meters from the shore, in the lunar path, at a height of one meter from the surface of the water, they saw the back of a huge sea animal.  And the back was without fins.  They observed this animal for a few seconds, then they heard the sound of an oncoming wave.  The monster disappeared under water.  They looked at each other and simultaneously said: "Without fins".  As professionals, they began to compare this monster with other famous inhabitants of the Black Sea.  It was not like any other animal known to them. <br>  Asking the local fishermen, I learned that the Black Sea ‚ÄúBlacks‚Äù for them is as real as the other inhabitants of the Black Sea. <br>  For many years, watching the monsters, they found that snakes appear most often after heavy storms and during the migration of dolphins in spring and autumn.  The most frequent fishermen observed the Black Sea "Bleka" in areas from the village of Novy Svet to Cape Kiik-Atlama. <br>  At Kara-Dag and Cape Meganom there are several underwater caves, in one of which, perhaps, our monsters live. <br>  In the summer of 1998, Mikhail Kondratyev, a diving specialist, discovered an entrance to an underwater cave at Cape Meganom, at a depth of 10 meters.  Michael swam in a scuba 50 meters into the inside of the cave, then gradually the depth began to decrease, and he went to the land.  Having illuminated the cave with a lantern, Michael saw a huge hall.  After walking a few meters through a cave that went into the depths of the cape, he stopped.  Silence.  From the arches of the cave rhythmically dripping water.  Suddenly he felt an inexplicable fear and rushed into the water, swam to the exit of the cave.  Getting out of the underwater underground world, Mikhail breathed a sigh of relief and climbed aboard the launch. <br>  In 1985, an old man named Vatud, who by this time was already 106 years old, came to die in his village, Azamat.  He told how a snake was killed, which according to legends had stolen small livestock and other animals from the inhabitants of this village for many decades.  Vasily Yakushev, a resident of the village of Azamat, recalls that in the steppe and the Kuchuk-Karasu river delta, there used to be a lot of unusual snakes.  There were often met three-meter snakes, with a diameter of up to 15 cm, a gray snake with dark stripes, about a meter long, which had a crest at the tip of its tail.  Several times shepherds saw a small snake sucking milk from goats.  Repeatedly observed how the snake rolls into the wheel and quickly rolls on the ground from the hill.  In 1961, the guys from the village of Azamat played football in a gully.  Suddenly they saw a small wheel rolling down the hill.  When it rolled, it became noticeable that this is nothing like an ordinary snake.  The boys stoned him. <br>  In the summer of 1957, Victor Filipovich and his friends were riding bicycles near the village of Almaznoye, Sovetsky District.  Suddenly they saw that a wheel was rapidly rolling down the hill.  This wheel stopped a meter away from them and began to turn around, turning into a half meter snake.  Frightened, they rushed to the village.  One of them after this incident began to stutter. <br>  Emir Abibulaev before the war lived in the village of Uppa (Native).  He told me that near the village, under the rocks, near the Upena waterfall, there lived large snakes, up to three meters long.  Locals called them Ajdaga.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These snakes did not touch people, and once one of the "reptiles" even made friends with the Emir's father, Refat Emiruseinov. The serpent accompanied him on campaigns in the forest. Once he saved his life. Emir Abibulaev also remembered that another interesting snake lived in the forest. Tatars called it "Bazyurek" (Ice Heart). This snake was very thin, it rolled up like a spring, then sharply straightened and flew to its victim with an arrow.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Osmanov Ismail and his wife Faina, who lived in the village of Tatar-Osman (Green), Bakhchsarai district, recalled that a huge snake appeared in the forest, more than four meters long. The head was like a dog. On the back of the snake was a mane. The eyes are dark. Once a hunter was returning from a forest to a village along a mountain road. Suddenly, on the trail, he saw this snake. Frightened, he threw his gun and ran to the village. Returning to their meeting place with the villagers, they did not find the snake, they only saw a trail on the road. Subsequently, many more villagers from Tatar-Osman and Blessed saw this snake. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The locals of the Varnut valley, the villages of Goncharnoye and the Reserve, sometimes found unusual snakes in the forests and lakes of the valley. Especially often they were seen in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCape Aya. Once a forester met a three-meter serpent on the shore of a lake.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the summer of 1978, Sevastopol artist Vladimir Dovgan and his friends, artists from Moscow, were returning from a hike. Passing near the lake, near the village of Back, they saw a snake hanging on the branches of a tree, more than a meter long. The serpent was gray. At a distance of 10 cm from the head he had two legs. The artists looked at the snake well and even subsequently sketched it. They stared in surprise at the reptile for about a minute, then it disappeared among the branches.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The type of this snake, my friends - professional serpentologists, could not determine. Some types of long-footed: pythons, bolerins, skinks have rudiments of limbs, but according to scientific data in the Crimea there are no these animals. Theoretically, according to unverified data, Proteus-Olm, a tailed amphibian, is found in the caves of the Crimea. For many years now serpentologists of the Crimea have been looking for a toad, garlic boxer and many more reptiles and amphibians that have not yet been discovered in the Crimea, but according to some sources exist.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Numerous observations of unusual reptiles in the Crimea suggest that in ancient times and even before the war, huge snakes and monsters lived on the peninsula. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Several individuals may still live in the Crimea and in the Black Sea to this day. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to discover, describe and make a film about the Black Sea "Bleka", it is necessary to organize a special expedition using underwater vehicles such as "Langust" and "Reef". </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before the war, the shores of all the Crimean rivers were covered with impassable thickets of thorns, wild rose, wild cherry, dogwood and other trees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Forests and steppes were not as densely populated and plowed as they are now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, in Crimea, relict species of reptiles and animals, which are still unknown, could well have survived. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our scientists, serpentologists and ichthyologists, still have a lot of sensational discoveries to make.</font></font></div>
