In addition, their delivery can result in significant complications.  Therefore, you should use the service for reliable shipment to Russia or CIS countries.  We have selected 5 current projects that will make the future closer with <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> .  Do not be surprised that they are devoted to the summer season - it has not ended.  Ideas on how to improve life and the environment are still distinct, and prices have not had time to grow to indecent values. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Zero breeze </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b3/7df/6ed/0b37df6ed34e428d857811ed56b9b4e2.png"><br><br>  The developers described this project as a ‚Äúmultifunctional portable smart air conditioner‚Äù.  Already interesting, right?  Zero Breeze is a heat gun on the contrary: it does not heat, but cools.

      Inside it is a closed type cooling system with DuPont cooler.  At the exit - an adjustable fan.  The device works from the built-in battery, which is enough for 5 hours of continuous use.  There is enough power to lower the temperature to 6 degrees Celsius on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã5 square meters.  Moreover, the developer insists that Breeze is able to work in open space, and even positions it as a portable air conditioning unit for recreation. <br><br>  In addition to the main purpose, this generator of cold is equipped with a 3 W Bluetooth-column, 250-lumen LED-lamp.  A powerful built-in battery and 2 front-facing USB ports allow you to use as a portable power source for smartphones or tablets. <br><br>  There are 33 days left until the end of the collection of contributions to the project, but the developers managed to collect 3 times more than the required 100,000 dollars. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1253665084/zero-breeze-the-worlds-coolest-portable-air-condit">Read more</a> <br><br><h3>  Cannonball audio </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/af2/da6/521af2da60764b64961506f83f676862.jpg"><br><br>  If you do not want to catch cold under streams of icy air, water will be an excellent salvation.  And to turn the bathing into a party, you should look at this wireless Bluetooth-column. <br><br>  Unlike many competitors, <b>Cannonball Audio is</b> offered just as a gadget for swimming.  Therefore, the device is not only waterproof, but also water.  Therefore, it is excellent on the water and even has a waterline, exactly in the middle.  To ensure that 5 W of power does not go to the sky, the manufacturer has proposed an effective system for dispersing sound around the device, designed to provide circular sound recording of the area.  So there is no need to search for a suitable place for placement - the Cannonball should float in the very epicenter of the fun. <br><br>  This project has not yet managed to collect the amount needed to start production, there is still 55 days ahead. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/3279241/cannonball-audio-360-ipx-7-floating-speaker">Read more</a> <br><br><h3>  pakiT City Bike </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c06/a43/154/c06a43154be24073954b9d15781a6840.png"><br><br>  An ordinary bike is not always possible to take with you on a journey, even a short one.  Startup <b>Bike Friday</b> decided to help lovers of cycling by presenting a bike that fits in a backpack.  Which, by the way, fits into the permissible overall dimensions for air transport. <br><br>  In addition, the mass of <b>pakiT City Bike</b> , depending on the modification, is only 8-9 kilograms.  So if necessary, you can freely carry it with you. <br><br>  You can participate in fundraising for the project within 24 days.  But even without additional contributions, the production of a wearable bike will start on schedule - the developers managed to collect 75 thousand dollars instead of the required 50. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/greengear/pakit-city-bike-lightest-folding-bike-ever-fits-in">Read more</a> <br><br><h3>  AIRLOK </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75f/690/b4a/75f690b4a0454730a045e9f32028832a.jpg"><br><br>  For those who prefer overall bikes, this advanced bracket for wall storage will come in handy. <br><br>  AIRLOCK is useful not only for home, but also for street storage, as it is resistant to burglary - the manufacturer claims that it will not be easy to cut it even with a grinder.  Not to mention the fact that for each copy of this bike carrier 3 unique keys are attached, which are very difficult to fake.  Certification is present. <br><br>  So far the project has not gained the required 70,000 pounds, but there is still 26 days ahead. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/airlok/airlok-high-security-bike-storage-hanger-store-loc">Read more</a> <br><br><h3>  Karmic kyoto </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e2/d23/566/0e2d23566dbd4c7e943f0312afac7c8c.jpg"><br><br>  A very interesting project of a hybrid bike ... For girls. <br><br>  The manufacturer has already noted a successful fundraising for the production of a hybrid <b>Karmic Koben</b> .  <b>Kyoto</b> is a similar vehicle.  The electric motor can be used in two modes: as an auxiliary power unit, and as the main one.  In the first case, with the help of the transmission system, the propeller allows you to increase the torque (and speed, of course).  In the second, even the pedals do not need to turn - he will do everything for the person. <br><br>  Although <b>Kyoto is</b> equipped with a female ergonomic saddle and positioned as a female bicycle, it is quite difficult to recognize the vehicle for the weaker half.  <b>Karmic Bikes</b> engineers concentrated on weight reduction, ergonomics and ease of operation, leaving the opportunity to purchase a novelty for both children and men. <br><br>  26 days left until the end of the fundraising.  So far, only one fifth of the required amount has been collected. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hongquan/karmic-kyoto/">Read more</a> <br><br><h3>  PS or how to buy on Kickstarter using Pochtoy.com </h3><br>  All of the above can be brought using <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">our service for sending goods from the United States</a> .
