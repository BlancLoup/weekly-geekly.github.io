The US office has a unified IT platform where numerous government agencies and departments can safely post their data.  The White House has announced a whole set of very interesting requirements.  For example, the data center, in which most of the clerical work of the capital‚Äôs officials will be conducted, must be moved outside the city limits of Washington.  Particularly stringent requirements were formulated for the downtime of the future data center, which will ensure the functioning of a number of state.  institutions, it should be as low as possible.  A well-established system for backing up lost data, an enhanced security system ensuring the confidentiality of government databases, as well as the possibility of placing third-party clients on the state-leased site for commercial use are important requirements for the Data Center.  About these, as well as other criteria when choosing the State Data Center.  Depot.  will go further in this article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d6/180/96f/0d618096f7a142248e11a7cf935414ca.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The contract for services will presumably be concluded for six years, starting as early as November 25 - this is the date by which the selection of the applicant should end.  According to the announced technical assignment, the object should be placed at a distance of 480 to 560 km in a straight line from Capitol Hill, while the distance from such risk factors as the Atlantic coast and any military object should be at least 160 km.

The data center must provide secure racks from external interference by unauthorized employees. There must be an equipped place on the building to house a satellite dish with a diameter of at least 5 meters.  Another condition is the obligatory provision of a site of at least 70 square meters in the territory of the infrastructure complex, where representatives from each of the agencies could be located, information of which will be located in the data center. <br><br>  In the contract presented to the general public, the point of uptime is particularly marked - it should be close to 100%.  In case of non-observance of this obviously difficult attainable figure, increasing penalties are envisaged if the time of failure to provide the service in full exceeds 5/9% (0.5555 (6)).  Each of the server racks should be powered from 5 to 20 kW.  One of the contract clauses requires monitoring the ecosystem at the location of the data center and studying the impact on it; this requirement does not carry any special technical burden on the applicant.  order, but rather will be a response to the environmental aspirations of American society, which must be met. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42d/14e/692/42d14e692520478395cd77de7c84bc34.jpg"><habracut><br><br>  According to experts, the order for such services has become a response to the Senate‚Äôs initiative to consolidate state assets.  structures, voiced in 2010.  Under the auspices of this initiative, entire units of state.  Apparatus take appropriate action.  The purpose of these actions is to increase the reliability of data storage at minimum financial costs. <br><br>  At the moment, the situation with the placement of information state.  institutions is such that the databases of different subdivisions, even within the boundaries of one service, can be scattered around different data centers in the country, because the site is selected based on the results of a competition in which applicants for state.  the contract for the provision of services, from all the vast country, would have a chance to win it, providing the most favorable conditions.  In such a situation, IT specialists noted obvious difficulties in ensuring connectivity and monitoring information integrity, both as a result of technical failures and because of targeted malicious actions. <br><br>  Among the mentioned state.  Agencies that plan to place their data in the selected data center based on the results of the tender: the Library of Congress, the Capitol Police and Architecture Department, the Congressional Budget Office, the State Audit Office, the State Agency of Press and other related legislative services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a3/e0a/bcd/2a3e0abcd6104988ac3735ae86aae146.jpg"></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242063/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242063/</a></p>
