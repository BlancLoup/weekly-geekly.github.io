  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Will Microsoft HoloLens ignite or not?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A series of tests of the Microsoft HoloLens device led me to an ambiguous question - " <b>Will this product ignite or ignite this innovative device from the IT giant</b> ."  The first time I tested it on the defense of final certification works of students of our program " <a href="http://game.hsbi.ru/">Management of online gaming projects</a> ", where HoloLens was brought by one of the members of the expert committee, for which a special thank you to him.  After that, he tested it several times at conferences and in person with the owners of this device.  Under the cat, I collected a brief information on the device, the views of the professional community on its prospects and my own impressions, as well as a survey for the habrasoobshchestva.  I would very much like to know your opinion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f02/7d4/ae6/f027d4ae611b470c86b2b7a2c626d2b6.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#0066cc">In short about HoloLens</font> </h2><br>  This is a small computer that is worn on the head and does not require any binding to external devices.  Before the eyes is a translucent screen, which serves visible objects that create the illusion of the real presence of an object in the world.  The screen - waveguide lenses - lenses with a wavelike prismatic structure, which properly refract and send images to our eyes from microdisplays located on the sides.  A detailed description of the optics and specifications <a href="http://holographica.space/articles/microsoft-hololens-10-6983">here</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a03/d1b/951/a03d1b951b1345f99d97fa905ae2359f.jpg"></div><br>  A strong difference from other augmented / mixed / virtual reality devices is that <b>HoloLens are completely autonomous and their work is not tied to either a smartphone, or a computer, or to a box on a belt</b> .  In theory, they are designed to visualize architectural projects, to create realistic 3D models of the human body, useful for doctors, for training, to be another tasty piece of the Windows ecosystem and to use the top ten and all its applications through hololenses, for ‚Äúholoportation‚Äù, for more efficient communications that are better than skype etc.  That is, now I‚Äôll not just send the designer TZ to fix his ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù, but put a finger on him, poking his hololens, that there is a growth zone in his design and where exactly this zone is located.  Judging by the positioning of the device, the greatest expectations of him <b>in the b2b segment for use by food professionals who require visualization</b> .  Well, about the entertainment industry, too, do not forget.

Neither Met nor ML, I personally did not try.  If someone suddenly had such pleasure - share. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0066cc">Feasibility</font> </h2><br>  In general, the biggest question in HoloLens is the practical feasibility of using them, especially at a price of 3K dollars.  True, this is the price of a devkit, and perhaps the consumer version will be cheaper.  So, I played games on HoloLens and watched a virtual tour of spherical panoramic images of Rome and Machu Picchu.  I liked to play, but this is only for the wow-effect, it's cool, but in the long run, you can't play them yet, as there are simply no big quality games for HoloLens and, in general, a variety of content.  Virtual reality devices (Oculus, Vive, Sony) are now at least actively filled with games.  These games are not AAA class, but they are increasingly and the quality is higher.  There is something to play.  And HoloLens doesn‚Äôt have a question, will it?  I have not heard announcements of famous studios about the development of content for HoloLens.  However, it is worth noting that even small teams in Russia are now starting to do this / <i>upd.22.10</i> - so it‚Äôs interesting in the comments that there is a whole <a href="https://holodevelopers.slack.com/messages/general/details/">sleek chat</a> for developers on Lenza (unofficial, but there are about 300 people, mostly with devices) / And do not forget that the focus of Microsoft on this device is still directed to b2b. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea5/b6b/aa8/ea5b6baa8ede451dac6fad960a89c4d0.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0066cc">Will ignite or not</font> </h2><br>  Based on the assessment of the feasibility and technical characteristics of the device, there are different opinions about whether there will be a demand for HoloLens or not.  Thank you for the opinions of the participants of the professional community on virtual reality (A. Artishchev, V. Meshcheryakov, A Lisovitsky, etc.).  On the one hand, <b>there is a strong opinion that it is possible to draw a parallel with google glass, that they say they will follow the same path and there will be no mass demand</b> .  Given the high price, low FOV (30 x 17.5 degrees), lack of content and a normal ecosystem, trying to make a universal product like google glass will end up with a product without a target audience, such as not grabbing one hand for nine birds with one stone, so what if To watch googledrends now, you can see a low hyip exactly on the hololes in comparison with other large VR / AR devices.  By the way, Sony VR cannot even be added to the chart, since the rest will be lost on its background. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3e/e69/7d2/f3ee697d266e48028403471e299bad52.jpg"><br><br>  On the other hand, <b>there is a strong opinion that while this is a devkit, an early and crude prototype is only for debugging and revision</b> .  And it‚Äôs very good that HoloLens do not sell for less than $ 3,000 - people who understand very well what kind of dividends this purchase may bring to them in the future, aware of the risks, should buy such things.  And that when they refine, debug, create an ecosystem, high-quality content will be ready in large quantities, they will solve the problem of too modest FOV, increase the battery life, then at a lower consumer price they will enter the market and ignite.  It will probably be in a few years, but when exactly is the topic for discussion.  Let's discuss it in the comments and in the attached survey. <br><br>  In addition, once again I will voice such advantages of the device as the absence of wires and generally complete autonomy, tracking of gestures, cool 3D visualization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2db/115/2f6/2db1152f6241408daa04ac7e5e055236.jpg"><br><br>  <b>In my personal opinion, the prospects for igniting are good</b> .  They are also due to subjective sensations.  I will describe them in more detail.  So I spend 20+ minutes in a virtual reality helmet and it becomes hard for me, I feel that I have to go out.  And in HoloLens did not feel this, on the contrary almost get used to it.  For me personally, this is a strong factor in favor of the success of this technology. <br><br>  So I think Microsoft Hololens is a good foundation for the opportunity to create a convenient and popular product in the future.  Now you can show it to friends, use at conferences, and most importantly, those who have a desire to take the risk, you can start making content right now under HoloLens, waiting for the explosive growth of this technology and become one of the first to jump onto the engine with money. <br><br>  I would be very happy for your comments on the topic of the prospects of HoloLens and other devices of mixed reality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313232/</a></p>
