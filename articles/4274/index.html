  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Exotic Web 2.0 Development From Outside of America</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As numerous examples show, creating a wonderful service does not require huge financial resources or American citizenship.  For example, some simple guy from Chile could come up with an innovative way to navigate private ads (by the way, the guy really invented this way and alone created the startup <a href="http://www.theadcloud.com/">TheAdCloud</a> ). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Business 2.0 magazine has published a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/08/09/technology/webaroundtheworld.biz2/">short guide</a> to startups Web 2.0 outside of America. <br><br>  Of course, the overwhelming majority of foreign startups thoughtlessly copy American ideas, but there are also original designs, as well as competent improvements in Western ideas.  For example, the <a href="http://muti.co.za/">Muti</a> South African website copies Digg, here you can vote for the most interesting news, but the site also contains a <a href="http://muti.co.za/static/newsmap.html">map of the world</a> showing the cities where the news came from. <br><br>  One of the most powerful office suites that work through the browser is also not created in the US, but in Canada.  It is called <a href="http://www.dabbledb.com/">Dabble DB</a> and includes online versions of spreadsheets and DBMSs.  They are optimized for group work and support RSS and groups.  The program costs from $ 10 to $ 250 per month - and many pay.  A great addition to this Canadian design is the <a href="http://www.zohowriter.com/">Zoho Writer</a> .

      The Israeli project <a href="http://www.myheritage.com/">My Heritage is</a> based on a slightly crazy idea: it is a mixture of genealogy, home photo album and automatic face recognition.  The person uploads family photos to the site, and the face recognition program distributes them across the family tree.  An interesting feature: the system of artificial intelligence in your photo can tell which celebrities you are most like. <br><br>  Another Israeli startup <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/">Metacafe was</a> created in the image of YouTube, but there is still a stanalone program through which you can download videos from the site and watch them offline. <br><br>  Chinese Web 2.0 startups are impressive primarily for their scale.  For example, in China there are more than 600 blogger platforms.  The leader is <a href="http://www.bokee.com/">Bokee</a> (formerly BlogChina).  Now there are more than 2 million users, but by the end of the year, the developers promise to increase their number to 10 million. Another representative of China is a community of 125 thousand video <a href="http://www.toodou.com/">podcasters Toodou</a> .  This startup has already received more than $ 8.5 million in venture financing. <br><br>  The largest social network in Asia, <a href="http://cyworld.nate.com/">Cyworld</a> (Korea), consists of many 3D-rooms in which registered users live.  The site brings its developers up to $ 300 thousand per day (!) On the sale of virtual furniture and other furnishings.  Very similar to the Korean development of the Finnish social network for children <a href="http://www.habbohotel.com/">Habbo Hotel</a> .  Here, too, each has its own room where you can play with different objects. <br><br>  The most popular of European social networks, <a href="http://www.openbc.com/">OpenBC,</a> looks completely different.  Rational Germans have created a serious network for managers, managers and job seekers. <br><br>  Irish RSS aggregator <a href="http://www.nooked.com/">Nooked</a> collects a <a href="">thematic catalog of feeds</a> , each of which is custom-made and used for marketing purposes.  For a small fee, the customer receives complete statistics on the readership. <br><br>  The Czech plugin called <a href="http://www.allpeers.com/">AllPeers</a> turns the Firefox browser into a full- <a href="http://www.allpeers.com/">featured</a> file-sharing client.  Directly in the browser displays a contact list and a list of files that can be downloaded from foreign computers. <br><br>  The RSS aggregator of the new generation <a href="http://www.feeds2.com/">Feeds 2.0</a> monitors the behavior of its ‚Äúhost‚Äù and suggests that it might be interesting to read. <br><br>  As you can see, talented developers live not only in America.  A lot of them in Europe.  For example, the German website <a href="http://beta.plazes.com/">Plazes</a> is one of the most convenient tools for adding your own layers to Google Maps, and the Swiss <a href="http://beta.plazes.com/">CoComment</a> is the best assistant for a lazy blogger.  It keeps track of all the comments that you leave in various blogs, and stores them in one place, from where they can be moved to your own blog.  The list of interesting startups from Europe is complemented by French <a href="http://www.wikio.com/">Wikio</a> and <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a> .  The first is a global information archive with automatic collection and sorting of news and tag support - this is the new brainchild of entrepreneur Pierre Chappaz, who sold his previous startup Keikoo for half a billion dollars.  The second site is a personal page builder with Ajax support, very sophisticated and convenient.  On the Netvibes site, more than 4 million users have already taken shelter. <br><br>  One Russian startup, <a href="http://www.quintura.com/">Quintura,</a> an interactive search engine, got into the list of Business 2.0 magazine.  Mention in the Western media should help him attract the attention of investors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4274/</a></p>
