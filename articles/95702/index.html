  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About technical issues and notifications ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The QIWI payment service is a convenient service for paying for everyday services.  So says the inscription on the site QIWI.  So far for me it was so, because QIWI is: <br><ol><li>  on each corner on ten, so it is not necessary to search; </li><li>  quickly - you don't always have time to hide the wallet, and the payment has already passed. </li></ol><br>  However, the old woman is a rupture ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  The essence of the hole </h4><br>  Till now has not passed the payment.  I put the money in the terminal, according to the time on the ticket, at 15:19.  The topic I write at 18:14.  That is, almost three hours have passed, but there is still no money. <br>  Attempts to call customer service did not succeed.  The answering machine informed me that there might be delays in crediting, and reassured me that the money would arrive as soon as everything was repaired.  Then he hung up. <br><br><h4>  Disclaimer </h4><br>  I will not write about the fact that QIWI has deceived everyone and that everything around is bastards and all that.  This is superfluous and has no effect.  Instead, I will point out a few fatal service errors ...

    <h4>  Errors </h4><br>  First, it does not follow at all from the message of the answering machine that technical problems do exist.  From the fact that there was no live person on that side of the telephone wire, it can easily follow that QIWI has long since put it on its support service with a clapboard.  I personally would not be surprised if it turns out that a technical error message was recorded on an answering machine a couple of years ago, and they forgot about it.  In other words, I (and not only me) do not believe the robots, but the living person did not confirm the existence of technical problems and did not provide any further information. <br>  Secondly, like the first, I was not told the main thing - when exactly it is planned to fix these most technical problems.  I know about problems with enrollment even without robots - otherwise I would not call support.  It is more important for me to understand - should I run to find a mobile phone salon in order to replenish my account again, or with what I have in my account while I can wait for the elimination of the malfunction?  In other words, what should I do?  QIWI did not bother to provide me with at least some information needed to make a decision. <br>  Thirdly, I am surprised by the behavior of the actual terminals.  For example, ATMs tend to be cut down, one has only to lose contact with the bank, let alone other failures.  Why don't the QIWI terminals do this?  There can be no delays in time, otherwise payments would not be made almost instantly.  Terminals in case of failure - even if the terminal itself does not fail, but some kind of central system - must either receive a remote shutdown command, or should be able to diagnose the system's performance and, accordingly, the ability to make payments.  One way or another, in the event of a failure, the terminals must be turned off or blocked so that people do not shove money into them. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  QIWI is a convenient service for everyday payments.  But at the same time, QIWI cannot be recognized as a reliable service and is unsuitable for the prompt implementation of urgent payments.  The reasons - the inability to predict the time of payment and the lack of even minimal control over the process. <br><br>  PS While writing this post, the money came.  But essentially this does not change at all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95702/</a></p>
