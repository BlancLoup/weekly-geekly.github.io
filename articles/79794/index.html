  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The objectives of the site design (Redesigned and finalized specifically for Habr)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Creating a website, a person first of all wants to convey to the public the fact of his existence and the fact that he can be contacted, that he is now also part of the Internet.  In turn, the Internet reacts to the emergence of new sites, like a living organism - it either pushes newbies further, provided that the site was created correctly, or leaves unnoticed.  It will take a lot of effort to get your website among the billion others to breathe.  A lot of effort must be spent on both the code and the design, because the appearance is the first thing that users pay attention to. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>The first goal of the site</b> is to keep the visitor as long as possible, the <b>second</b> is to take a step towards attracting attention to their services or products.  To realize the first, a special approach to filling the site is required, including a detailed study of all visual materials.  This is due to the fact that if you only work on one component, then the person will still leave, because there are no trifles in life that are not important. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/78e/e57/c77/78ee57c7743c56180a88481a51b1f036.jpg" alt="image">

      If the text on the page is interesting, will be correctly formatted and contain illustrations, then the task can be considered completed.  In this case, a person learns something new with interest, he is already yours, and unless you show where to follow him after reading, he most likely will not go anywhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd4/628/c47/cd4628c470de9b65e36fbce1123c0a00.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is also worth noting that in our time more and more people grow up on cartoons and comics, we pay less attention to books, from which it can be concluded about the content of your site: it should include many illustrations.  Some studios involved in the creation of Internet projects, mainly in Russia for some reason, are focusing on content visualization, not realizing that visitors will notice only a beautiful picture in full screen and, after watching it, will leave the site. <br><br>  It is necessary to understand the weight of each action you perform, especially when most of your work should appeal to you.  Betting only on pictures will result in an error when you refer to the attendance statistics.  ‚ÄúEvery little thing is important‚Äù - this is the conclusion that every day comes a great many professionals who are ready to help keep and direct the visitor in the right direction.  The work should be carried out side by side by the customer and the performer, as you are working on creating a new life.  But what will she bring to the world?  You decide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bcf/911/cc7/bcf911cc74d17d1dc45aec5f3b470d30.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also, it should be noted sites-stores, whose main task is to buy goods, making that, the user brings you a profit.  In order for more customers to come to the store, you need to pay attention to the design of the site, its content, and the validity of the code, that is, its compliance with standards. <br><br>  How to persuade the visitor to make a purchase?  The answer is obvious: it is necessary to make the use of the site convenient and simple, that is, such that any person understands what he needs to do next, how to call him to you, or make a purchase directly from the site.  The support of many payment systems is also required, so that the client can at any time get his beloved Master Card or Visa, open Yandex.Money or Webmoney and bring joy to you and yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a93/467/b70/a93467b701e3cedfa26240182a8cd757.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, we figured out what is important when creating a website - to find the golden ratio in order to get a product of natural quality.  Da Vinci himself described the structure of each object on the planet from the point of view of the golden section.  Everything in the world is beautiful and balanced - this is exactly what is required of the creators of sites: take into account everything and balance between. <br><br>  - Team " <a href="http://webprofiters.ru/">WebProfiters</a> " </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79794/</a></p>
