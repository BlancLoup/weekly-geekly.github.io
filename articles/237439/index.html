      <br>

      Together with iCloud, the program <b>‚ÄúFind My Iphone‚Äù</b> works.  Wikipedia: <br><blockquote>  The application "Find iPhone / iPad / Mac" ("Find iPhone / iPad / Mac") allows you to find any device running iOS or Mac OS, block it or remotely erase all data.  To detect, you need to activate this function on the device itself by entering the username and password of your iCloud account.  Disabling the function without entering the password can not be, so it can serve as protection against theft.  To work you need to connect to the Internet. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Lock </h4><br>  If the device disappears, the host can go to the iCloud service and block the device.  You can even send a message to the lock screen of your device for the one who turns on this device. <br><br>  The stupidest thing is when the owner locks the device, but does not indicate in the message on the lock screen his contact details.  Neither myself nor the people. <br><br><h4>  Reasons for device blocking </h4><br>  Let's start with the most ‚ÄúI am not guilty.  It is self ‚Äùand we will reach the worst ones. <br><br><ul><li>  You bought an iPad, created your Apple ID account, entered it on your device, but did not save your username and password.  Some time later, you decided to reset the device settings or update it to iOS 7-8.  And then iCloud will send you hello in the form of an Apple ID request and password that you have already forgotten. </li><li>  Someone bought an iPad, but he was too lazy to customize the tablet himself.  Someone ‚ÄúNutyzhkompyuterschik‚Äù or the seller of the store set him up and did not give the password and login.  Someone resets or updates the device - hello from iCloud. </li><li>  You buy a device from your hands or online.  You did not check whether the old owner‚Äôs Apple ID was removed from the device, the seller forgot to delete it or did not specifically want to.  Reset or update - hello.  And some sellers specifically sell this, then they block the device remotely and demand money. </li><li>  You walked, walked and found an iPad.  Its owner has already noticed the loss and sent you greetings through the iCloud lock screen.  If found, it is better to return to the owner for a fee.  :) Especially the Wi-Fi model.  There is no sense from it yet. </li><li>  Someone imperceptibly for the owner lent his iPad.  He noticed he blocked it. </li><li>  Someone noticeably and with malicious hooliganism borrowed from the owner of the iPad.  The owner came to his senses and blocked the iPad. </li></ul><br>  Remember that stealing and buying stolen goods is an illegal activity. <br><br>  If you happen to 1 or 2 option, you can unlock the iPad officially. <br><br><ol><li>  Follow the <a href="https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do">link</a> and make sure you have free technical support.  Otherwise, you may have to pay. </li><li>  Find the purchase receipt, warranty, delivery of the device. </li><li>  Find the email and the name of the person who were entered when registering the device.  May require an answer to a secret question.  Most likely, you do not remember any of this. </li><li>  Call or go to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HE57%3Fviewlocale%3Dru_RU">official Apple technical support</a> .  Better in foreign, because in the CIS most of your problems do not care. </li></ol><br>  It is not recommended to talk about what you someone in some store set up.  Otherwise, you are waiting for epic fail: send to search for this person. <br><br>  It is recommended to turn on the ‚ÄúFull kettle‚Äù mode: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs itself‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand this‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the settings are‚Äù.  Women can enter into a mild tantrum and put pressure on pity.  Will affect many men, but do not overplay.  This is not a screen test.  Practice on someone. <br><br><h4>  Where do these instructions come from? </h4><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Story</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  To read color books, I decided to buy a tablet for my ebook.  I almost bought a locked iPad mini 3G.  I read about iCloud and asked repairmen on the Internet.  In different places called prices at $ 80-160.  (O_O) <br><br>  Googled  It turned out that there is a solution for a limited group of people who do not share with anyone and "take off" good money from people.  And also, taking advantage of the ignorance of the masses, they sell unlocked devices with the description: ‚ÄúAlmost new.  All perfectly.  Only 3G does not work in our country. ‚Äù <br><br>  On w3bsit3-dns.com there were no solutions either.  Only the theme of crying is 280 pages long. <br><br>  I decided how Robin Hood to help people and began to google hard.  99.5% of Russian speakers didn‚Äôt suggest anything at all or need to pay a lot.  For GSM versions I found pieces of information in Vietnam and China.  Part of the information bought.  The most expensive and rare scheme was sent by Russian Alexander Khokhlenko. <br><br>  Now I am posting everything online so that these devices do not lie on the shelves and people do not pay a hundred dollars for removing 1 part. <br><br>  At this moment, most repairmen "Unlock $ 100": <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/463/bb6/073/463bb6073a1c8d06a146bf2971076ced.jpg" alt="image"></div><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  The essence of the method </h4><br>  I design, retrain to programmer - I don't understand circuit design.  If something is wrong - do not be angry and correct me, please. <br><br>  IPad versions with Wi-Fi only are tied to an Apple ID account by serial number, which is stored in NAND memory.  Versions with 3G / 4G / LTE are tied to the serial number + IMEI, which is stored in the modem module. <br><br>  The process for all iPad 3G consists of the following steps: <br><br><ol><li>  We disassemble and pull out the main board of the iPad 3G </li><li>  We find on the board part of the Board ID, which is responsible for identifying the device. </li><li>  Disable the modem part there.  It will be necessary to unsolder and (possibly) solder a resistor. </li><li>  The device goes into DFU mode, because the Board ID does not match the firmware.  On the screen of the iPad 3G, it is unlikely that there will be anything (maximum apple). </li><li>  We connect to iTunes.  It will not immediately detect your device.  Then he will find as an unknown iPad.  We restore the firmware from the WiFi version and it's ready.  GPS will work too (bonus). </li><li>  Disable automatic firmware update: Settings \ iTunes Store, App Store \ Automatic downloads \ Updates.  Suddenly, Apple will want to block such devices in the future. </li></ol><br>  I did not check it myself.  Enough on Android.  Successful reviews with details about unlocking are <a href="http://pasha4ur.org.ua/articles/difdevices/131-how-unlock-apple-ipad-2-3g-icloud-locked">in the comments on my site</a> .  Also there are instructions in 2 languages ‚Äã‚Äãin the form of large pictures. <br><br>  <i><b>Ahtung!</b></i>  <i>There are no such instructions and NEVER-NEVER will be for versions with Wi-Fi.</i>  <i>Do not ask me about it in Skype 1001st time.</i>  <i>There are only software methods that mostly do not work or are available to units in the world.</i> <br><br>  Remove resistors in different ways.  Depends on professionalism and hardcore: <br><br><ul><li>  ground </li><li>  unsolder </li><li>  "Removed" with tweezers </li><li>  scratch with a needle :) </li></ul><br>  The circuit closure procedure is also done in different ways: <br><br><ul><li>  solder a resistor to an empty space </li><li>  solder the jumper </li><li>  draw a pencil line (many did in the lamp era of overclocking with AMD Athlon and Duron) </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Unlock </h4><br>  If you are not sure that you can disassemble the device yourself, give it to the professionals.  Apple product displays are quite expensive.  You do everything at your own peril and risk! <br><br>  After the procedure, it is best to turn off the firmware update so as not to be blocked by Apple in the future.  The unlocked iPad mini has already been successfully updated to iOS 8. <br><br><h5>  Unlocking iPad 2 3G </h5><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/abxg4mIGv-k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhidjVhKYNNW1bVRu3lWOEcv0Codgg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://pasha4ur.org.ua/images/phocagallery/stories/portfolio/apple/ipad2unlock/iPad-2-Schematic.pdf">IPad 2 3G device layouts (PDF)</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/480/d5c/5cd/480d5c5cde1c9b2555a852faf798f903.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  On the iPad Model A1396 (GSM), remove the r1205 resistor (10 kŒ©). <br>  On Model A1397 (CDMA), transfer the r1205 resistor to the r1204 position. <br><br>  GSM has been doing for so long, but CDMA in personal correspondence was confirmed only by 1 person. <br><br><h5>  Unlocking iPad 3 3G </h5><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ltAHPWhWpvc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiJ-O-EpL4MmeaiqCnn11cFfwoP0Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://pasha4ur.org.ua/images/phocagallery/stories/portfolio/apple/ipad2unlock/iPad-3-Schematic.pdf">IPad 3 3G device layouts (PDF)</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cec/5ea/db0/cec5eadb01fd3eecd5039f4c1cc303fb.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  On the iPad Model A1430 (GSM), remove the r1204 resistor (10kŒ©). <br>  On Model A1403 (CDMA), perhaps move the r1204 resistor to r1205.
