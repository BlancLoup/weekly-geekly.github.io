The future has come.  You heard about it?  Representatives of the scientific community and technology companies never miss the opportunity to use this hackneyed phrase, owned by William Gibson, to advertise their new inventions, and how they will change the world.  Science fiction writers with their fatal utopias or innocuous comics about space adventures, as well as Netflix with their Black Mirror and Alter Carbon, are not far behind.  All of them have put a lot of effort into creating an enthusiastic and childishly frightening idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat humanity will expect in the coming decades. <br><br>  I decided to join this glorious company of dream creators about the future and draw a picture of the coming decades.  The only difference is that I took for this one of the most powerful forecasting tools - TRIZ.  (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Wait a second.  Please read my introductory note.  Call it a disclaimer, as all these boring consultants do.  You should by no means think that you are reading another fantastic opus.  This is a technically sound scenario that we can play with you.  In this sense, this is not an invitation to stick an academic knife under my ribs, if you have a clarification and improvement.  Let's finish the missing together.

      Oh yeah, get some coffee.  It obviously will not be superfluous ... <br><br>  <b>All mentioned technologies already exist *</b> <br><br>  * In case you are an attentive reader - the following explanation is for you.  Others - go to the next paragraph.  We mean that all the conclusions about the existence and accessibility of technologies or objects, tools, equipment, vehicles, resources and even the types of control that such technologies make possible in our essay are based on the fact that all such technologies already exist or studied directly or indirectly over the past decade.  Some of them are already simplifying life.  Others exist only in the laboratories of enthusiastic inventors. <br><br>  <b>Now you are ready to go back to the sunny morning of 2035 ..</b> <br><br>  Against the backdrop of quietly playing country rock.  This is Adam's favorite music.  At least it was, until he set it on the alarm clock. <br><br>  And why I didn‚Äôt fall asleep again last night in time, - a short tormenting thought flashed through his head.  Eyelids reflexively clapping, getting used to daylight. <br><br>  At 11.45 pm he went to bed with a clear plan to fall asleep until midnight.  But as soon as his cheek touched the soft surface of the pillow, he remembered that he had not voted for the new amendment to the world rules of molecular bioethics.  He spent about 20 minutes reading the arguments in favor of reducing the age of subjects who were allowed to make molecular changes in the biosphere.  An hour after he supported the amendment, he realized that he had been scrolling over an interactive Wikipedia article about analyzing the quality of the soil on a newly discovered planet for forty minutes while the all-terrain vehicle quietly rolled along this unfamiliar landscape on the next screen. <br><br>  What else to spend time at one in the morning, if not to analyze the composition of the soil?  - Adam asked himself sadly.  The answer appeared automatically in his head - the information will certainly be useful for managing the environmental investment portfolio, bringing him points in the competition of builders of new ecosystems. <br><br>  Adam drove unplanned reflections on the soil of distant planets and began to scrutinize the landscape seen from behind his own window. <br><br>  Moving on this floating decentralized cluster ‚Äî definitely the best of my ideas ‚Äî Adam smiled as if he was tapping himself on the shoulder. <br><br>  He would like to prolong the pleasure of these minutes, but, as his grandmother would say: "Happiness cannot last forever."  Adam noticed that the greenery near the hydropark looked neglected.  He always prided himself on a good view and never missed the opportunity to spend a couple of minutes peering into the noisy haste of the cluster, the deep green of his parks and the neighboring children playing nearby.  Why are the ever-flowering rhododendrons so dry?  It looks as if a pack of March cats held a party there yesterday.  Adam was upset. <br><br>  Instantly, the system counted his mood.  On the smooth glass surface a window appeared in front of his eyes with a notice.  The system proposes to chip in with a neighbor to rent a gardener robot.  Without hesitation, Adam pressed the green "OK" button and sighed with relief.  Everything else happened automatically - the cluster tokens were deducted from Adam's account and transferred to the smart contract account.  Escrow was acted by their AI cluster management company, selected at the end of the winter session. <br><br>  Good morning, Adam thought with pride, had not yet reached the bathroom, but had already solved so many problems. <br><br>  He sped up to take a shower.  His stomach insistently reminded him that time for solving other problems would be only after breakfast. <br><br>  Adam came under the stream of hot water, turned on the last song of Radiohead and added molecular protection for swimming in volcanic lakes.  While he was singing along to a new track, the molecular ethics scoring evaluated the impact of Adam‚Äôs body transformation on the ecosystem.  The home molecular scanner / printer sent the ecosystem tokens to the account of the serving decentralized service company.  Adam never understood why self-organizing service companies need a rate of profit if self-development is limited to the DAO of the region and does not imply going beyond the existing functionality.  He decided to check the transaction history of this service company, logging in with the key client-investor.  Adam did not fulfill his promise not to work until breakfast.  As usual. <br><br>  Hmm, it seems that the transaction of October 16, 2034 turned out to be a profitable investment in a long-term analysis of the effects on the ionosphere of compounds formed using the molecular protection of this company, Adam said.  Without any efforts, Adam automatically came to the conclusion that this allowed the service company to reduce the tax burden on cleaning the near-Earth protection and to prepare a planned reduction in tariffs. <br><br>  Can dine with Salt, if my memory serves me right, - suggested Adam.  In fact, his memory-enhanced stem therapy never misfired.  He remembered that he was introduced to John Salt by his English friend Victor.  Victor had an extraordinary talent to create opportunities from nowhere.  This is probably a trait - the main reason why we are not very close, - continued Adam, brushing his teeth. <br><br>  Adam belonged to the type of people who do not like crowds in their hearts and prefer to have a small circle of friends.  But his friends are real soul mates.  Most of them are very well-known skeptic empiricists in narrow academic circles and part-time managers of successful production companies.  But Adam revered them for their flexibility in thinking, an endless stream of ideas and the courage to embody even the most perilous of them.  Adam hated senseless chatter.  Salt impressed Adam with a man who has something to say, but who was not ready to meet in a bad society.  - So maybe in ‚ÄúMirage‚Äù?  Great place for first joint thoughts. <br><br>  At the moment when Adam decided to book a table for Wednesday night, his relaxed mood left him as fast as the water from his soul fell into the drain.  Another good idea visited him.  Even without leaving the bathroom, he made a motion to reduce the planning horizon.  He was confident that due to the tendencies toward relocation to the terraformed planets, the pressure on the ionosphere would fall unpredictably.  This can be a huge waste of money for a local service company.  It is better to buy tokens of the ethical moderator of the alliance of service companies and to conduct calculations within the framework of data on long-term investment strategies related to the relocation of key dynamic residential complexes. <br><br>  After the bathroom moved to the sacred area of ‚Äã‚Äãhis apartment.  His workplace.  In fact, the system integrated into the apartment allowed it to work on any smooth surface in the apartment.  But he liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhaving a separate workplace.  A table, a chair, a good stereo system and a variety of instruments that he used to design his projects.  However, it would be a mistake to call Adam old-fashioned.  He was a catcher of inspiration.  He liked this nickname, which the dark-haired girl had once christened him. <br><br>  Immersed in a working chair, he returned to his main project.  Adam worked in his own three-dimensional polygon.  And now he continued to work on a cluster of biomodules for the shuttle.  You may ask why?  After all, you probably know that phantoms do not need a biosphere.  However, the idea to find a new potential colony among the stars and get an award to them.  Columbus did not leave him for several months.  His 3D modeling system launched 12 million virtual machines, recreated all known physical conditions in space.  For this, Adam even bought for one-time use data from distant space probes without the blockchain verification of validity. <br><br>  The last AI spacecraft designer was purchased.  This version is well proven during the design of shuttles to the solar corona.  Adam compartment is the most extreme scenarios, leaving only those that can provide 90% of the survival of protein species.  The system offered seven types of shuttles with parameters close to those required.  He was pleased with the current results.  Then he booked a place in the regional voice field for further cyber-physical modeling. <br><br>  What about breakfast?  - he unconsciously asked himself.  A second later, he had already caused a passing supersonic Wiman and shuttle to the interception point.  At the interception point, the atomic clock-synchronized gun threw the shuttle into the air trap of the vimana rushing by.  The sophisticated ultrasonic pillow compensated for the overload and Adam comfortably found himself in a cabin of the first class of a trans-Atlantic floating gallows. <br><br>  Its features consisted in the possibility of modeling the flight characteristics of three-dimensional physically accurate phantoms at the junction of two media.  One medium was simulated from air, the second one from water.  A cigar-like projectile with emitters simulating the test object was placed in the center of the dome.  Only the moments of critical loads were worked out.  After the associated computerized three-dimensional simulation was supplemented with data from the sensors in the voice field, and artificial intelligence tried to bring the object to the ideal in real time, driving the transformation in boundary environments. <br><br>  While all these complex mechanisms shook the floating ground, Adam ordered a molecular seal of turkey fillet with baked mushrooms.  This dish was genetically determined by its DNA and supplemented with enzymes designed for it. <br>  Today Adam is lucky.  He met one of his comrades - Boris Son.  Adam did not include Boris in the list of his close friends, with whom he practiced meditative reflections.  However, he was a strong expert in certain areas of neuroscience.  They had a pleasant conversation.  They discussed the possibility of transporting key areas of the team‚Äôs brain for later reconstructing the true being and personality without losing the quantum integrity passport. <br><br>  Suddenly, their conversation was interrupted by an incoming call.  A certain confederation of private settlers of the Kuiper Belt asked for charitable assistance to support the evacuation of several thousand settlers.  While Adam was saying - What the hell is going on, a rocky plain appeared before his eyes, covered with exhausted people.  The video stream was intermittent.  The smartphone's anti-virus has calculated fraud indicators - the amount of requested financial support did not exceed the emotional signature limit of the transaction.  The photon scanner has fixed a unique halo, unusual for a physical object.  Included probabilistic filter video.  He found a small clone with a cybernetic flesh-colored exoskeleton and a primitive makeshift holo-camera. <br><br>  The reason why Brad and Adam's lively conversation was interrupted became ... rats.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to raise the question of how to end these petty scammers,‚Äù Adam shouted aggressively.  The community of feral cloned rats due to mutation has reached a super development.  Now, using ethical windows in the legislation, they got their own quantum wallets and started pumping themselves, withdrawing funds from wildcard contracts with vague goals for dynamic remote space environments.  Such a primitive scam was well caught in a calm state.  Their trick was aimed at trying to find a person in disheveled feelings at an inconvenient moment and, using the correction protocol as part of a partial connection, to obtain a temporary verification of the transaction by cutting off the flow at the right moment. <br><br>  Adam calmed down and ordered a glass of orange juice.  It's time to go to the voice recorder for final testing.  He was confident that the virtual model of the shuttle would work without significant errors.  Let's see how viable this virtual computer model is in a holographic medium - Adam was excited.  In addition to the great hope that the new algorithms will solve the problems encountered in previous testing, it has always been fascinated by testing in a holographic environment. <br><br>  Five minutes after his arrival, Adam was already sitting in a comfortable chair opposite a large, smooth surface.  Pleasant blonde offered him a structured refreshment.  Who needs refreshments when you test the work of your life?  - Adam was nervous and could not control his thoughts.  The program allowed to transfer all previous prototypes in a few seconds and prepare them for the holographic stage.  It took the system only a few hours to get rid of the shuttle testing and re-create the characteristics of all possible physical media.  The shuttle experienced all the most severe conditions in the galaxy.  All this - by creating wave modeling in the holographic sphere. <br><br>  As soon as a hologram of a rotating blue clock appeared in the air, Adam could not hold onto a chair and jumped out of it.  Wait Indicator.  In just a few minutes the system will evaluate the results of his work and reflections on which he has been building for many months!  He felt something like that when he expected the results of the final examinations at the university.  Before the consciousness managed to finish with these nostalgic memories, the system sent a notification.  Heck!  Failure! <br><br>  He did not spend much time regretting and asked the system to reproduce the failure scenario.  Of course!  As usual!  Problems with molecular flexibility!  - Adam said loudly, despite the fact that he was the only one in the room who heard these words.  The blonde left in accordance with the requirements of confidentiality.  Shifting werewolves need the ability to analyze the quantum transition in dynamic environments, ‚ÄùAdam continued, looking at his feet, as if the answer was written on his shoes. <br><br>  There are only a few changes in the original virtual model - it had a fallback just for the configurations of this parameter.  Replaced the primary code and loaded the corrected version into a holographic simulator. <br><br>  Adam stood in complete silence.  Silence soaked the air in the room, soared in his thoughts.  For a long time, his brain was not able to analyze, count, compare and think.  The only thing that throbbed in his head, chasing the veins and arteries after the blood, came out with drops of sweat on his high wrinkled forehead - this desire for success ... <br><br>  In fact, success was the only option.  Five minutes later, a notification of the completion of testing arrived.  One of the proven options gave excellent simulation results! <br><br>  Adam decided to postpone the celebration.  He smiled.  At the touch of a button, Adam bought a virtual scene and launched a crowdfunding campaign among trading robots from key research funds for printing a shuttle and expedition equipment.  He divided the mission into segments, giving investors free access to all information.  This allowed him to easily collect the necessary volume of micro-transactions.  The shuttle went to the new sector and thus, all shareholders received the priority right to all the information collected during the expedition.  Such information is much more valuable than the resources spent on acquiring a share. <br><br>  Moreover, each member of the research consortium that has become a shareholder will be allowed to participate in the expedition in the three-dimensional virtual double of the shuttle.  Sensors on a real shuttle will transmit data to a special platform.  The platform will recreate every detail, every surface, every stone and every speck of dust to recreate a virtual virtual shuttle and allow scientists to get close to unexplored stars and planets. <br><br>  Adam felt like a winner.  In fact, he really was.    .     , ‚Äî    , ‚Äî         . <br><br>         .         . <br><br>       , ‚Äî      .      ,      Terra Incognita.         ,    .     ,         -     . <br><br>         . ,       ‚Äî  ,    .             ‚Ä¶ <br><br> ‚Ä¶   <br><br> (    ‚Äî     .         ‚Äî  .       ,  ,   (GE),  ' (IBM).      . <br><br>    . ,        .
