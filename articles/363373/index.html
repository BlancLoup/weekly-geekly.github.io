The troll lives under the bridge, the gnome lives in a cave, a bear is sleeping in a den, and the geek prefers the Internet, i.e.  we are talking about almost any place on the planet where there is a network.  But Geek House cannot be a typical parallelepiped ferroconcrete monster, around which there are asphalt and concrete fields. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCreative space‚Äù is not just the name of an art exhibition, but a real factor affecting our productivity.  Home for the geek becomes a continuation of the familiar world of technology and freedom.  Going on a trip, you often lose the opportunity to choose housing according to your own ideas about the spirit of comfort.  But everything in another house, starting with the doors and ending with telephones, a computer and a stove, can become as cozy as a favorite blog.  To achieve the appropriate level in ordinary hotels is difficult.  It is easier to find someone who shares your world views (at least in part) and is ready to rent out the relevant housing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Castle, tree house, school building - strange, eccentric, intriguing ads appear on the Airbnb.  All these places are beautiful in their own right, but rarely can they be the object of virtual worship and the embodiment of hobbies.  Most of the beautiful, geeky houses in a good sense can only be seen in the pictures on the Internet.  Therefore, we have collected a small selection of announcements of places that actually exist and are currently offered for rent.  Not every day you see this.

    <h4>  By plane </h4><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/4516821%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a1/f4b/409/8a1f4b409cc74d27b2be2c6f3483ef83.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Aircraft!  Yes, this is a real, blue-white jet plane, which crossed the globe 3675 times, and is now temporarily available for housing.  Located next to the airstrip of the lively Amsterdam Airport, the aircraft is provided with all amenities.  That's how you can get in your own use 366 square meters of space, where you can find a living room, a bedroom, two children's beds, two kitchens and eight small bathrooms.  There is Wi-Fi, a toaster, a coffee maker, a TV and a game console.  And here are 116 windows!  From the cockpit it is convenient to watch other planes that take off and land at the airport.  For complete happiness on board there is a selection of aerokinoklassiki (including the film "Snake Flight"). <br><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/1405703%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d1/b5d/07e/1d1b5d07e67d441294fdb49c267de679.jpg"></a> <br><br>  We recognize: housing, which at any time can fly away, is not the most suitable choice for a traveler.  An alternative "apartment", located in France, will never rise to the sky, but is still ready to receive passengers.  Of course, we are not talking about the ‚Äúcomplete set‚Äù, you will get a little more than a cabin.  But it is open all year round and the bathroom is very unusual. <br><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/28501%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9db/4fe/ee3/9db4feee387f4d20980a212517e9afd5.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/28501%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ecc/faa/ffe/eccfaaffe0ef414abf627fd004d134c7.jpg"></a> <br><br>  For the biggest fans, a forty-meter IL-18, built in 1960, was turned into a suite for two.  The cockpit is preserved in its original form, but everything else has been renovated (we will not show it so as not to hurt the feelings of the fans of Soviet aviation).  In the distant past, thousands of passengers would know that someday a jacuzzi will appear on board this ship ... <br><br><h4>  Ship </h4><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/215281%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53f/916/43f/53f91643f0f844a89b3082fefde0fb7c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Have you ever lived on a yacht on land?  Wait with the answer.  We have an even crazier combination - it's like a house standing inside another house.  So with this boat, located inside this hotel.  In the boat there is a bedroom in which you can comfortably spend the night ... imagining yourself in the midst of the boundless ocean.  A great option for aquafoba. <br><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/1284749%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b9/4c1/665/0b94c16651324531aa72239f1cbf561f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  A real yacht with a hired crew also appeared in Airbnb (and not just simple yachts, but with a history dating back decades).  An alternative option is a land ship.  This "boat" is located one block from the Pacific Ocean.  Unfortunately, inside nothing resembles about the ocean - an ordinary apartment with all conveniences (a <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/26707%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post">house-dog</a> does not look like a <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/26707%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post">dog</a> from the inside). <br><br><h4>  By train </h4><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/1168301%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/990/18f/961/99018f961f9d45aca09036b6dbc168d2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The bedroom in the 1935 carriage is not surprising, but there is also a bathroom, a full kitchen and a real stove.  A rare place that looks nicer inside than outside (fans of trains may not agree with us).  Electricity, sockets and other benefits of civilization in stock. <br><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/3603304%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fdb/10e/eb1/fdb10eeb1a8d4666bb231bda96297bd0.jpg"></a> <br><br>  We do not know whether this idea uses the Russian Railways idea, but it is definitely popular in other countries.  There is no electricity in this train, and foxes, badgers, deer and otters live around.  Any place can be like this, but the secret of success lies in the history and authenticity of all the details.  Those who have a railway in childhood caused indescribable delight, do not need additional explanations. <br><br><h4>  By car </h4><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/1415162%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f49/8ae/3ef/f498ae3ef10a4c8da968292e33a14eb2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The coast of Spain magically turns into Gelendzhik - in the sense that you will just live on a bus to the coast.  The difference is in the details.  The vintage bus of 1954 is located in Ibiza, inside there is a vinyl record player, and solar panels are installed on the roof.  We have hippie cars and ancient, like mammoth bones, home-on-wheels variations, but this bus, thanks to the well-integrated modern technologies, looks out of competition.  (It is necessary to say about one significant shortcoming: the host did not hang the curtains, and any guest will wake up with the first warming rays of the sun) <br><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/3088767%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28f/513/152/28f5131526b047258cd3a90e6f03849e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Another veteran of 1976 is surrounded by forest.  With sadness, we recall all the stories about Ikarus quietly separated into scrap metal.  And after all from them similar hotel rooms could turn out.  There is no place for high technologies here, but the atmosphere of immersion in the world of transport is able to charm any enthusiastic person. <br><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/434469%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c83/e7e/073/c83e7e073fdd443ebf939c363a68857f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And in this funny trailer of the 1930s, everything is now there, even an iPhone docking station.  No geek will be left without gadgets and communications surrounded by virgin nature.  Immerse yourself in the environment of a combination of antiquity and modern technology - this is an easy way to see the world outside the usual coordinate system. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Of course, these are not all examples of such announcements in the style of transport geek house.  The world is huge and diverse, and this hackneyed statement concerns not only nature.  Therefore, having gone to another country, try something completely new for yourself, look not at hotels and rented apartments, but at such unusual places to stay.  After all, memories of the trip consist not only of attractions and local cuisine. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363373/</a></p>
