  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unlimited mobile internet overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My new job is connected with constant traveling around Moscow.  But not only do you have to drive, you also need to send documents to the post office and upload photograms to file servers (I monitor the work and repair digital billboards if necessary).  Well, I plan to do all the work on the network through the mobile Internet.  Conveniently.  But what to choose?  Such a question is not resolved with the candidate, and the gugleg began. <br><br>  Beeline, Megafon, Yota, MTS, Skynlink and Comstar, of course, came into view.  Considered, of course, only unlimited tariffs. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      And so, the rates: <br><br>  Beeline delighted us with this: the ‚ÄúFresh‚Äù tariff, 500 MB of free GPRS-Internet traffic + unlimited Wi-Fi, all the fun is 1000 rubles.  But I did not understand, but what kind of anlim is it, if there is only 500 meters of free traffic, or did I misunderstand something? <br><br>  Mts.  Well, yes, bogaaato.  Tariff ‚ÄúBudget unlimited‚Äù - cost 900 rubles per month, speed 128 kb / s.  Achtung!  Unlimited internet access is available from 02.00-06.00.  The package includes 3.5 GB of traffic.  Sorry, but I'm sleeping at this time!  The remaining tariffs, ‚ÄúUnlimited Online‚Äù and ‚ÄúInternet Lawlessness‚Äù also provide unlimited Internet only late at night and cost more. <br><br>  Megaphone.  Subscription fee 890-1390 rubles.  From the price depends on the amount of traffic, after the exhaustion of which the speed is chopped.  By the way, they all have unlimited space only at night.  There is the ‚ÄúFast and the Furious‚Äù tariff - 600 rubles, well, at least the name reflects the content. <br><br>  Yota  4G (the technology I care about the least), per month - 900 rubles, anlim constantly, around the clock, that is.  1 day without limit costs 90 rubles, a month - 900 rubles.  The offer is almost like on the home Internet. <br><br>  Sky Link.  There is a tariff ‚ÄúUnlimited megacity‚Äù, 900 rubles per month, but you will have to pay 3 rubles / MB for accessing the Internet from the Moscow region.  There is a tariff specifically for the Moscow region, it is more expensive, and does not interest me, since I spend most of my time using the network in Moscow.  Amused the tariff "Children's Internet", 150 rubles per month, but you can only surf on children's sites)) <br><br>  Well, the last number in our program will be Comstar.  Most of all, the M3 tariff is similar to unlimited.  10 gigs of traffic per month are offered for 700 rubles.  Excess traffic will cost 2 kopecks per megabyte. <br><br>  With the tariffs figured out, let's now take a look at the coverage: <br><br>  We begin, mmmm, well, let's with Beeline.  The site coverage map for Moscow is not published.  You can see Tver and other beautiful hero cities, but there is no first-altar one.  Sadly <br><br>  Dele MTS.  Somehow it‚Äôs very bad, and especially in the northeast and southwest, strangely, there are many new areas, it‚Äôs not reasonable to cover the open spaces there.  Deaf zones in the northwest and southeast.  Almost not even covered the near Moscow region. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Megaphone.  Already better, but south and northeast deaf zones.  Again, the territories of the new districts remain without the mobile Internet, and some of them do without the Internet, because not every new business has a new one ... there is no local network, or something else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Yota  Dense coverage in Moscow and even in the regional centers of the nearest suburbs like Lyubertsy, Shodny, Odintsova.  It looked like a coverage across Russia - 5 cities ... Well, in Moscow it is better, of course, but that's what I need.  Plus, decent speed is almost like that of a locale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Skylink covers Moscow and Moscow region, which is well seen on the map) If you believe her, then there is a signal all over Moscow, but the site warns that the quality is influenced by the landscape and buildings.  Even with a good reception speed will not be particularly, because the frequency of 3G in Moscow is clogged by the military. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Comstar covers Moscow and even reaches some places near the nearest Moscow region, like Khimki.  In the forest plantations do not fry, so that in the Bitsevsky park you will not get into the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  This is what I managed to find on the Internet, if there are any additions from subscribers, I‚Äôll read them with pleasure.  With the choice has not yet decided.  But I tend to Yota, because only she has a real unlimited and good speed.  Who thinks what?  What are you using? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96863/</a></p>
