You have already heard about the fact that we conduct machine learning and data analysis courses at <a href="http://bigdata.beeline.digital/">the Beeline Data School</a> .  Today we are celebrating the 6th edition on our <a href="http://bigdata.beeline.digital/">analytical course</a> and the 4th on the <a href="http://bigdata.beeline.digital/datamba">course for managers</a> .  Only having time to release one course - we recruit a new one.  After each new release, we collect feedback from our listeners, analyze it and make our program even more saturated with practice and examples from real business. <br><br>  They write to us from all over the country and from outside of it with questions when the School of Data will appear in their city.  We responded to these wishes and expand our presence.

      Today we are pleased to announce the launch of our <a href="http://bigdata.beeline.digital/spb">program</a> <b>in St. Petersburg</b> !  We collected the best teachers in this glorious city, prepared a wonderful program and in this post we will tell all the details of the training. <br><br>  The course starts on October 28th, will be held on Mondays and Fridays in the evening from 19.00 to 21.00 in the Beeline company office at Vasilievsky Island, 21 line, 6, letter A (the nearest metro station is Vasileostrovskaya). <br><br>  Ahead of us waiting for 18 lessons (the course is designed for 9 weeks), in which we will try to cover the most important topics of data analysis. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A distinctive feature of our classes is their practical orientation. <br><br>  Our country has always been famous for the school of mathematics and today many people who know how to build high-quality models <a href="http://rb.ru/news/data-science-nash/">win Kaggle competitions</a> .  But for our practice, we have repeatedly seen that this is not enough to make ready-made products that are capable of bringing a measurable money benefit to business. <br><br>  It is important to have an idea about product metrics, it is important to know about the algorithm development process, how often and how to correctly retrain models and much more.  Therefore, in our courses, we devote a lot of time to the analysis of pitfalls, various ‚Äúrakes‚Äù and everything that can occur on the way to the realization of the finished analytical product. <br><br>  Our program consists of an important data analysis section, such as Machine Learning, which is about a third of our course.  Then we introduce students to the most demanded areas of data analysis - ‚ÄúSocial Network Analysis‚Äù, ‚ÄúRecommender Systems‚Äù, ‚ÄúText Analysis‚Äù, ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù, ‚ÄúLarge Scale Machine Learning‚Äù, and finally we talk about the best algorithms that were winners at Kaggle - in particular, we discuss the approaches of stacking / blending, ensembles and much more. <br><br>  You can read more about the course on the <a href="http://bigdata.beeline.digital/spb">main page</a> , but for now we would like to introduce you to some of our teachers: <br><br><h3>  Sergey Nikolenko </h3><br>  Specialist in the theory and practice of machine learning, in particular, word processing, big data analysis, Bayesian methods and models.  Senior Research Fellow, Internet Research Laboratory, HSE St. Petersburg, Research Fellow, Institute of Nuclear Physics RAS, Leading Specialist, Deloitte Analytics Institute. <br><br>  Author of more than one hundred scientific publications on machine learning, analysis of network algorithms, complexity theory and higher algebra, the author of several scientific monographs. <br><br><h3>  Andrey Filchenko </h3><br>  Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Technologies, head of the machine learning group at the Computer Technologies international laboratory of the ITMO University.  Lecturer courses in machine learning and data analysis.  Earlier he worked as a researcher at the SPIIRAN Interdisciplinary and Theoretical Research Laboratory.  Organizer of a number of data analysis and machine learning conferences. <br><br>  He graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics of St. Petersburg State University. <br><br><h3>  Natalya Pritykovskaya </h3><br>  Data mining developer at Odnoklassniki, previously worked as a data analyst at AdRiver and Yandex. <br><br>  Natalya graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics of St. Petersburg State University with a degree in Statistical Modeling, as well as from the Computer Science Center (ShAD Yandex in St. Petersburg). <br><br><h3>  Ivan Drokin </h3><br>  He is currently involved in a number of projects related to in-depth training and analysis of images and a video stream.  Previously, a leading specialist in data analysis in ZAO BIOKAD and a leading specialist in the closed hedge fund Finance Dialog. <br><br>  He graduated from St. Petersburg State University with a degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, postgraduate studies in Systems Analysis, Management and Information Processing, prepares a dissertation for the degree of candidate of physical and mathematical sciences in the field of deep learning. <br><br><h3>  Clement Merzlyakov </h3><br>  Analyst in the NAO "Ulmart".  Consultant for data analysis companies Alol and Paradox Brewery.  Clement graduated from St. Petersburg State University, as well as DM Labs.  Participant in analytics conferences. <br><br><h3>  Yevgeny Putin </h3><br>  Engaged in neural networks.  Worked in Kaspersky Lab, Samsung, Siemens.  He graduated from mathematics SPbSU in 2014. <br><br>  Our teachers are people who are engaged in day-to-day practical data analysis and have extensive experience in using it in real work. <br><br>  You can learn more about the School and register for the course <a href="http://bigdata.beeline.digital/spb">on our page.</a> <br><br>  See you in class! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311924/</a></p>
