  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsocial service "virtual personnel department"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãservice, that's just the question, how much will it be in demand?  Is it worth spending your time and energy on its implementation, or do you need to throw everything and only do it? .. <br>  What is your opinion? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><habracut><br>  For a better understanding of thought, we divide all people into two groups.  There are people who need to do some work, and they are willing to pay for it.  On the other hand, there are those who want to receive banknotes, and instead do the required work. <br>  So it was always between the employer and the employee.  Usually, a specialist, settling for a certain position, stipulates what to do, in what volume (duties, conditions, scope of work), etc.  The employer makes sure that the person is competent.  Ideal: the employee concludes an agreement with the employer - performs work, receiving in return a cash reward.  Both are happy: the employer gets the result, and the employee is rewarded for his work. <br>  Everything said above should be ideally, but in life everything is far from being so.  After all, life is changeable and not constant.  It does not always work as agreed.  A person cannot own everything professionally, although he must strive for this.  Everyone, even a specialist, has lessons for everyone, but there is one that does not like to do.  Conditions and scope of work are not constant, they change from time to time.  Direction, too, can change. <br>  Since most readers are familiar with IT firsthand, I‚Äôll give an example.  The person is arranged for work as the system administrator.  No one guarantees that he will not have to work as a designer or designer. ... And this is not his profile anymore!  On the other hand, the employer is counting on a professional result from an existing employee in all areas, and hiring an additional specialist is expensive, because he has his own.  Dismissing him and taking another for a while is not an option.  It remains to create and learn by trial and error at the same time, often to the detriment of the result.  Again, not always the same load.  An employee will have days when there is no time to raise his head, and there will be those when you just have to drink coffee and expand your horizons.  And he must always pay. <br>  Yes, there are various ways out of these situations.  Of course, you can order the same design in a specialized organization or temporarily invite another specialist.  But, I think, during technical progress, <s>while our spaceships plow open spaces ...</s> total informatization, when information is exchanged with space speeds, and not like before, when everything was on paper, there are modern solutions. <br>  Thus, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan ‚ÄúInternet staff department‚Äù with the elements of a task scheduler arose. <br>  That is a social network.  The peculiarity is that the staff is selected for clearly defined tasks, for a specific time, depending on the resume and their preferences.  At the same time, a potential employee can see what kind of work an organization needs and put forward his candidacy.  Here, the bet is placed on the speed of information exchange between the employer and the potential employee. <br>  Service where there will be groups of employees (groups = employees of a certain organization) who will be involved as needed, and each user can be an employee at the same time in different groups.  Example: Vasya Pupkin is in the group ‚ÄúHorns and Hoofs‚Äù as secretary, and at the same time in the group ‚Äúthe party of the sword and shouted‚Äù an electrician, as necessary, he is attracted to work.  At the same time, the Horns and Hoofs organization and the ‚ÄúParty of the Sword and Plowshare‚Äù have requests from other users who can replace Vasya, if for some reason he cannot complete the work.  This will allow to attract specialists as needed, and keeping one universal all the time will not be necessary. <br>  Moreover, the result of the employee-employer relationship is recorded and evaluated by both parties. <br>  Many will say that there are similar services. <br>  freelancer.ru - but this is a highly specialized service, only IT specialists rotate there.  And I'm talking about a more flexible service, where you can hire at least a gardener, or maybe a courier in another city.  There is a special assignment service (http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/54861/), but there are one-time assignments.  It is also interesting to not only create a project and hire people to carry it out, but also create a virtual organization and recruit social users to the group of reserve users (read: trusted potential employees) ... <br>  For now.  What will the collective mind say?  Will this service be in demand? <br><habracut></habracut></habracut></div>
