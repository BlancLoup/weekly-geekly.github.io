Throughout the company, I had a great opportunity to promote JavaScript.  Working for Mozilla is a great experience for me.  This company is one of the most friendly corporations that you can imagine, which employs some of the smartest programmers in the world.  I highly recommend you get a job here if you are looking for the best job you have ever had.

      I had the opportunity to promote JavaScript, as its evangelist (and create tools such as <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/FUEL">FUEL</a> , <a href="http://dromaeo.com/">Dromaeo</a> and <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a> ), as well as work JavaScript Tool Developer (and create tools such as <a href="http://swarm.jquery.org/">TestSwarm</a> , <a href="http://fireunit.org/">FireUnit</a> , as well as improve <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit">QUnit</a> ). <br><br>  All this time, Mozilla has given me the opportunity to work a lot on jQuery.  This resulted in 9 jQuery releases (including today's release of <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/03/jquery-16-released/">jQuery 1.6</a> ) and a radically improved jQuery organization (we now obey <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> , hold frequent meetings, hold <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-team-public">public polls</a> , <a href="http://jquery.org/updates/">report on the situation</a> and <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved">actively encourage participation</a> ).  Fortunately, work on the jQuery project has been progressing quite smoothly lately, which allowed me to spend a lot of time on other projects. <br><br>  I wanted to go back to active application development.  In my free time I worked on several applications (mainly for mobile phones, using jQuery Mobile) and now I have a great opportunity to be realized. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a98/209/dd8/a98209dd861ec959b7f7d36a36b0a3a4.png" align="right"><br>  Starting next Monday, I will work for <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> - to manage their Open Source activities and development in JavaScript.  If you are not familiar with Khan Academy, then I highly recommend to see the <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html">wonderful speech</a> of Sal Khan himself.  In short: Khan Academy is trying to radically change the processes and methods of teaching. <br><br>  Self-study and teaching of others is my long-time passion.  I see the Khan Academy as a fantastic place in which I can help support learning and work on creating the best learning tools, as well as get people involved in Open Source.  Most of all, I want to increase the size and activity of the Khan Academy community, attracting all third-party contributors and testers to its ranks. <br><br>  I‚Äôm going to start with rewriting the framework to avoid some problems, create an initial version of the iPad application and work on improving the Open Source activities of Khan Academy. <br><br>  For me, it is very important that Khan Academy is a non-profit organization and its work is aimed at providing free and free materials (videos, exercises and applications).  And I, with the help of the community, will work to ensure that this state of affairs will continue in the future. <br>  Khan Academy is interested in me working on jQuery daily and continuing to speak at conferences.  In addition, in the near future I will move from Boston. <br><br>  I have decided to stop some aspects of my professional life.  I will no longer take part in conferences.  Before the end of the year, I‚Äôm going to attend only Velocity in June, jQuery Conference in October and Fronteers in November as a speaker. <br><br>  A new co-author, Bear Bibeault, was brought in to help with the ending of my book <a href="http://jsninja.com/">, Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja</a> .  With it, it should be completed this year. <br><br>  I am very excited about the new opportunity and can't wait to start working.  Thanks to Mozilla for support over the past years and thanks to Khan Academy for taking me on board.  Forward to a wonderful 2011! <br><br>  ps  Yesterday, on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter,</a> Resig promised today to answer all the questions in Reddit </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118640/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118640/</a></p>
