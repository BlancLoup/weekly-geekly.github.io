  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AgileDays Conference March 22 and 23, 2018</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The AgileDays'18 conference will take place on March 22 and 23 in Moscow at the World Trade Center.  This year it is held the 12th time.  Once again we will prove that our conference is the coolest Agile in Russia and Eastern Europe! <br><br>  On AgileDays there will be almost 100 reports, workshops and discussions, interesting both to experts and beginners in the field of Agile.  We expect more than 1,200 participants - project managers and company executives, scrum masters and product owners, developers and analysts. <br><br>  We write this introductory text almost every year.  And now that the newcomer is expected this year. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  1. Theme </h2><br>  More precisely, its focus in the direction of the business.  Over the past couple of years, Agile has become not only the de facto standard in the management of technology projects, but has also gone beyond IT: flexible approaches are applied in government organizations, banks, commercial companies and not only.  Agile - not only about local optimization at the level of teams and projects, but about scaling to the business of the whole organization. <br><br><h2>  2. Live webcast </h2><br>  Of course, we write and publish videos of all reports every year, we have accumulated a decent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzMWFmAFm8WAjm0-q44i6WA/playlists">library</a> .  Entries are always very welcome and start asking almost at the time of closing the conference.  But for a long time we did not dare to take on the live broadcast.  There were two main reasons: <br><br>  - our scale, when we are simultaneously working in halls 6-7, <br>  - and, of course, the topic itself, which has long been relevant only to IT.  People gathered a lot, but it was more like a meeting of old friends. <br><br>  And if the first reason has not gone away, then the second - has lost relevance.  The topic is interesting to a variety of companies from small industries in the outback, to schools and ministries.  At the same time, it is almost impossible to get to a conference in Moscow from Kazakhstan, Belarus, even from most cities in Russia.  We will launch the broadcast in parallel from 4 rooms, where there will be reports.  The only exception will be a hall with master classes - there, as well as at the trainings, a physical presence is important. <br><br><h2>  3. The program is collected by attracted experts. </h2><br>  Content is our everything.  In recent years, only we ourselves have worked with speakers, we did not allow anyone to do this.  As a result, it turned out to be cool, but it was a tremendous effort: several ScrumTrek employees literally dropped out of life for a few months, the program was going to be late, everyone was at the limit.  This year we decided to return to our old practice and attracted Agile-enthusiasts :) As a result, before the conference there was still a month and a half, and most of the program was curtailed, despite the fact that the number of applications this year exceeded the number of slots 2.5 times.  In more detail about who and why is included in the program committee, and how we work with reports, we will write a separate post. <br><br>  <a href="https://goo.gl/a4kMLh">Registration on the site</a> .
