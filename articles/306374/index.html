  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Game Education in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few years ago, domestic education in the field of game design and game production was a rare beast.  <i>Education, speak?</i> <br><br>  Yes, in the West there!  Scottish University Abertay Dundee launched courses for game developers back in 1996.  Canadian School DigiPen provides a full-time undergraduate education in game development.  In general, in the 2000s, the growth of the video game market had a positive impact on the development of educational institutions involved in game development abroad.  Training is conducted on the basis of the Game Academy of Germany, the Academy of Arts of San Francisco, Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences and many others. <br><br>  <i>But what about Russia?</i> <br>  We have gamedev education began to appear later than in Western countries.  At the present moment <b>a number of courses and training programs for creating games of various levels</b> have finally been <b>formed.</b>  <b>We have identified the largest and most significant.</b>

Game design courses appeared there in 2012.  They are one-day intensives, involving 12 hours of study at the weekend.  This format was the most useful for people who want to get the first idea about the game design and gaming industry.  The courses help to understand what game development is and to decide whether to try to get there to work or not to spend on the games of your time.  A serious advantage is the price: for a one-day course, the school asks for about 12,000 rubles.  And for residents from the regions and neighboring countries, this format remains particularly interesting.  It is worth noting that the teachers of our program " <a href="http://game.hsbi.ru/">Management of online gaming projects</a> " come to teach classes in game design and monetization of games at RealTime School. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0066cc"><a href="http://screamschool.ru/">Scream school</a></font> </h2><br>  Another option for beginner game designers can be a private school at Scream School.  Its format involves a more in-depth and long-term study - 2 years, 3-4 lessons per week.  Like RealTime, this school is largely focused on digital graphics and most of the courses and intensives are conducted here on this topic, and there is also a game design course with a deep bias towards programming.  Training cost - 600 000 rubles.  Among the teachers of the school are many employees of Mail.Ru. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0066cc"><a href="http://game.hsbi.ru/">Graduate School of Business Informatics, HSE</a></font> </h2><br>  In higher education institutions in Moscow, educational programs on game design and game production did not exist until 2014.  It was then that the first in Russia comprehensive training program for the gaming industry based on the Higher School of Economics was launched.  This is a professional retraining program ‚Äú <a href="http://game.hsbi.ru/">Management of online gaming projects</a> ‚Äù aimed at giving students a system of knowledge on creating games and gaining practical experience in the development of their project.  In 2015, the first ten students graduated, and in 2016, the program has already trained 30 students in two streams.  In the process of studying under the guidance of practitioners from such gaming companies as Rocket Jump, Wargaming, Gaijin Entertainment, Mail.Ru Group, 101XP, Fibrum, Life is Feudal, etc., students create their own game projects from scratch, bring to a new level already available, or are employed in gaming companies (Rocket Jump, TrilobiteSoft, Mail.Ru, internships at Riot Games, work in VR companies and small indie studios).  Training on the program takes place within 8 months on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.  Classes last for 3 hours.  Tuition is 180,000 rubles.  As a result, students defend the final attestation work and receive a diploma of the established sample of the Higher School of Economics.  There are also short weekly advanced training programs at VSBI, in particular, such a <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/programs/professional_development/praktika-monetizatsii-onlayn-igr/">course on monetization of games</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/291/303/c21/291303c214e14d8ebb7103268673df07.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0066cc">Other educational programs</font> </h2><br>  There are also several online game design courses.  In particular, the course on the Universarium platform from the famous company Wargaming attracted widespread attention.  This is the program " <a href="http://universarium.org/course/460">Game Design: On the Other Side of the Game</a> ."  A number of educational programs on games: ‚Äú <a href="http://netology.ru/kursy/razrabotka-mobilnyh-igr-i-prilozheniy">Development of mobile games and applications for a product manager</a> ‚Äù or a <a href="http://netology.ru/kursy/prodvijenie-mobilnih-prilojenii">course on the promotion of mobile applications is</a> assembled on Netology.  Good online <a href="https://edu.devtodev.com/">game analytics courses have</a> launched devtodev. <br><br>  Game development courses also appear in Ukraine and Belarus.  Russian publishers and developers are actively introducing education into the workflow.  Someone pays tuition to their employees, someone invites experts to give lectures at company sites.  Many large studios even develop their own direction of education within the company. <br><br>  There are also a number of books on game dev.  In particular, here are some books you can read in <b>Russian</b> : <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Book title </th><th>  book author </th><th>  Link to the book </th></tr><tr><td>  The Art of Game Design: A book of lenses </td><td>  Jesse shell </td><td>  Translation <a href="https://vk.com/doc188822397_266045955%3Fhash%3Da69c6d82b2f5cd75bc%26dl%3Dc374d430decb443985">here</a> </td></tr><tr><td>  Level Up!

In conclusion, I would like to note that education is not a panacea, which makes it easy to succeed in game devise.  It only gives the person the right knowledge and lays the vector for further development.  What he does with the knowledge gained is everyone decides for himself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306374/</a></p>
