You do not need a detailed plan, you need to know where the Input will be and where the Startup exit is. <br><br>  Now how to create strategies. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The textbooks offer to find out the strengths and weaknesses of their competitors ... Risks ... These recommendations can be applied with a stretch in a startup, it is more suitable for existing businesses, a startup should ideally organize <b>its niche</b> to get the first mover and, therefore, the flow of free PR .  A truly distruptive startup is so unlike its competitors that direct comparison becomes irrelevant.  This will be a prerequisite for success.

      I propose a different approach for startups, the Porter method of antiquity: it is necessary to identify the <b>indispensable</b> elements of strategy from existing competing companies.  Then build your strategy on the fact that you have this element is missing (but there is something else!).  And make it so that the useful effect was <b>bright and valuable</b> .  Surely everyone knows about the success of SouthWest airlines: the guys fly short distances, with small aircraft downtime, do not feed passengers (food can be taken with you), do not pay commission agents, etc ... <br><br>  Take hi-tec example: the company creates a database of millions of pages on the Internet by crawling pages with robots.  You also want to search, but have no idea how you will look on the background of google.  But you reveal that crawling pages by a search robot is something that a competitor most likely will not refuse because of you, at least for a while it will be inertial.  (Note: you need not just to improve the link - the cornerstone of a competitor's strategy, but to qualitatively change it - or to abandon it altogether, knock out and substitute something else. The value for users can be changed, but not devalued.) <br><br>  Then your strategy will look, for example, like this: the search robot is replaced with a patch for the server, which informs the search server that the information on this site has changed.  (In addition, there are already RSS, etc.). Leaving the pros and cons, it is important now to demonstrate the strategy with an example.  And that's all.  You have a difference, the CHAIN ‚Äã‚Äãof such differences forms the strategy.  If we <b>successfully</b> repeat one link of a business strategy, we can say with probability 0.823, then the probability of a successful repetition of a chain of 3-4 links is &lt;0.557, that is, already ~ 50%.  As a confirmation, we can cite the failure of American Airlines in the market, where SouthWest is leading when they tried to copy the actions of competitors - not completely, but slightly improved.  Improving the individual links of the strategy is not the best way for a startup - because it is expensive.  It is more important to completely change the strategy, for example, by building: digg.com, del.icio.us - something like a ‚Äúsocial search‚Äù. <br><br>  Google, as you know, at one time - also radically changed one of the key techniques in search engines - the method of ranking search results.  Then he added other parts of the business strategy, and when he had already significantly advanced, it became clear that it was incredibly difficult to completely copy it.  Which affected the stock price. <br><br>  Thus, you can do with any strategy, with any startup.  In the beginning, you need at least one ‚Äúlink‚Äù that will significantly differ from those with whom you are going to compete. <br><br>  And everything will turn out!  Good luck! <br>  PS: it‚Äôs worthwhile to engage in strategy if you build an Ambitious Thing - in order to get at least free PR (which is many times more important for people who understand advertising). <br>  PPS: all of the above, verified by personal experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5367/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5367/</a></p>
