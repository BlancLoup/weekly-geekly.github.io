Passed with a small loss. <br><blockquote>  <i>... In any incomprehensible situation - mother.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>naval wisdom</i> </blockquote><h4>  Decision </h4><br>  I used foul language often, but mostly from admiration.  He left the computer, called the chewed mole, came back with a ruler ... the numbers converged to the thousandths. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cm/dx/t3/cmdxt3i9l3kuqhlkign_pnig8d4.png"></a> <br><br>  But first things first. <br><br><h4>  Those who do not like a lot of letters </h4><br>  It is clear that the 1C Enterprise is located there as a glove, and on standard, not premium disks.  So far these are the best servers from those that have been in my hands, both in quality and in terms of price / quality ratio.  Of the minuses only the lack of Russian language, Russian-speaking support and our mentality. <br><br>  The cost depends on the physical location, in mainland China, for example, one and a half times cheaper than in Western Europe. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xf/x7/ou/xfx7ouocx5nodzctfum7r-wcxxc.png"></a> <br><br>  To get a server in China, you need to send scans of documents (driver's license or passport).  Even if you are not going to place 1C or whatever in cloud services, I strongly recommend that you spend one dollar on registration and see what is the harmony of technical solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qw/1u/vz/qw1uvzvymfsuklvc2pgrugw4f4y.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, this is a server where Postgres + Ubuntu confidently beat Microsoft SQL + Windows in tests 1C. <br><br><h4>  Test circuit and operating procedure </h4><br>  Used: <br><br>  Windows 2008 R2 Server, Ubuntu Server 16.04 <br>  Postgres 11, MS SQL 2014 evaluation, under Linux MS SQL 2017 evaluation <br>  1C: Enterprise 8.3 (8.3.13.1644), Enterprise Accounting, Version 3.0 (3.0.66.70) <br>  crystal disk mark, winrar, 7zip <br>  HammerDB <br><br>  Test configurations from 1C sites <a href="http://www.gilev.ru/">www.gilev.ru</a> and fragster.ru, as well as processing emulates user work in 1C Enterprise Accounting. <br><br>  The configuration of both virtual machines is the same (4 cores 16 GB of RAM and 50 GB HDD) close to the real working one. <br><br>  Gui are installed on both servers and tests were performed alternately from one to another. <br>  Methods and references to the used configurations are in the first article. <br><br>  Pictures are clickable.  Full results printscreens under spoilers. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dq/ep/nx/dqepnxqsgcaknzksvcesppq6rau.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9c/ol/s5/9cols5iuswih8g7ctq8cqydufvc.png"><blockquote>  <i>Even the journey of one thousand begins with the first step.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Lao Tzu</i> </blockquote>  If books have been written about Azure services, then you can write a collection of essays about Elastic Compute Service services. <br><br>  Some of them I just do not know, not to tell how they work. <br><br>  This article, I just take the first step inside of this diversity. <br><br><h4>  Those who are not afraid of many letters, let's start </h4><br>  Print screens will not be mostly tests, but interfaces and various configuration steps. <br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúTo the question how are things going - howled obscenely, got drunk, filled the face of the questioner, beat his head against the wall for a long time - in general, he left the answer.‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>M.Zhvanetsky.</i> </blockquote>  As I said, Elastic Compute Service made a strong impression on me. <br><br>  From the very beginning ... From the very beginning, I found that out of 40+ proposed test products, the server for 1C could not be assembled - not enough power. <br><br>  I threw the bait into the support - and received a polite response that they did not decide such things, you must apply for financial support. <br><blockquote><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title">Lyrical digression:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I already knew this method of failure, practiced in the Scandinavian countries.  Nobody directly says no to you, they just wait for you to run out of breath while running in a circle. </div></div>  Therefore, the second letter was already sent with less enthusiasm ... A day later, three Chinese looked at me. <br></blockquote><blockquote>  <i>It must be said that, apart from innate politeness, in all aspects of communication, the Chinese can see pride in hosting the Olympic Games 2020. Therefore, wherever it is appropriate to see their logo:</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_q/si/fd/_qsifdrgdord3i617af6c7euehs.png"><br><br></i>  <i>And probably appropriate everywhere.</i>  <i>In Russia, they usually say this: Made with love.</i>  <i>For China, it may just be a job well done.</i> </blockquote>  However, two of them quickly took their leave, providing the EMEA region manager with communication. <br><blockquote>  <i>A guy from Moscow in a new car in St. Petersburg asks the way for a local one.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúAbout 97,‚Äù he says, looking at the numbers. ‚ÄúWhat region are you from?‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- It's you - from the region, and I'm from Moscow!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>anecdot.ru</i> </blockquote>  Which clarified the purpose of my visit, and I showed him on the prince what configuration I want to get <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n2/yv/qj/n2yvqjqm8z_5ncbkkwyek-skx-k.png"></a> <br>  (I was a little upset, of course, that I was not going to buy the server with barrels), took my word that I would help everyone from Russia to connect (which I self-confidently promised) and gave me a $ 150 coupon (a separate story is lower on the coupon) ). <br><br><h4>  ... and from here comes the beginning </h4><br>  As I said, the service is excellent.  Even thinking hard, do not come up with details that I would like to improve. <br><br>  It even seems to me that the service selection pages somewhat overloaded with elements are made not so by chance, but in order to hit the scale of what is happening. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m4/qy/ot/m4qyotds177hx6emyybhfzxuq40.png"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zs/-v/pl/zs-vpl3iz3o_eeawb0bi_xk37em.png"></a> <br><br>  At the same time, reasonableness is felt even in trifles - such as a virtual tour for a new user: <br><br> <a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cz/r3/ey/czr3eyacnse2bozgiswbid7py68.png/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oo/yp/fv/ooypfvbiqfx0_sfqujhcvi6eeai.png"></a> <br><br>  and compulsory acquaintance with SLA <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d8/qp/5d/d8qp5dkz9bt4vbza3gl0ni7fzzc.png"></a> <br><br>  or Ubuntu command line greetings (this is generally so cute). <br><br>  Well, the ability to work from the web interface is of course a killer feature. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pe/d3/ai/ped3ai-rl0ebjc9ijoqowtygxmc.png"></a> <br><br>  I think everyone who set up the server in the clouds, stepped on this rake - changed the RDP port and forgot to put it in the firewall or turned off the network card, a lot happens.  One careless movement of the mouse - and you are already on opposite sides of the monitor, the server quietly puffs somewhere in Amsterdam, and you in St. Petersburg beat your head on the table. <br><br>  And then if the virtual machine has basically started - you will get access to it. <br><br>  What else is convenient - there is a label on the page with support calls on each screen. <br><br>  <b>The very configuration of virtual machines and tests passed without a hitch.</b> <br><br>  What is not surprising, firstly in test machines there were 4 cores each, and secondly, perfectly balanced disks. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Winrar and 7zip tests</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zu/ts/qd/zutsqdomqvlcyjns-yszuzhhumk.png"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a_/4v/gg/a_4vggk395ag8ul4190uudgpq3e.png"></a> <br></div></div>  Internet access speed cut just as much as paid. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ib/mk/hf/ibmkhf9f3odx3lxtpgw1hmjcji8.png"></a> <br><br>  As I said, in this configuration of the equipment in the 1C tests Postgres rushed Microsoft. <br>  And with the default settings, more than the recommended. <br><br>  HammerDB tests for MS SQL almost reached the published official <a href="http://docs-aliyun.cn-hangzhou.oss.aliyun-inc.com/pdf/rds-performance_whitepaper_mysql-intl-en-2018-05-04.pdf">Alibaba Cloud Performance White Paper</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">results</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0d/wj/fx/0dwjfxxyxv4j-j3tzhu62a8jzcw.png"></a> <br></div></div><br>  APDEX is expected to be maximum in both variants. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fi/6m/lo/fi6mloswgphoqy4xj4g0rikywge.png"></a> <br><blockquote>  <i>... And then Ostap suffered ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"Twelve Chairs"</i> </blockquote>  <b>- Wouldn't a puruka go ?: I thought.</b>  <b>And assembled the configuration of the virtual architecture of the medium business of your dreams</b> <br>  (This is of course a word of wit, in fact, just which I would recommend, I have more dreams). <br><br>  Namely: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wr/ca/1h/wrca1h3ldhfbbuwgtsxdic5msaa.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iv/to/qy/ivtoqyfyyfyv1ajqf0tmpgo4gce.png"><br><br>  Almost fit into the allotted $ 150 coupon. <br><blockquote>  <i>Technical retreat: a VPN and a WWW server could of course not be collected by myself, but of course you could buy ready-made, in the set of services offered, of course, there is one and the other, just like ApsaraDB for MS SQL, for example.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But VPN seemed to me that it would be more expensive, but for web servers, the configuration is rather weak, it will not pull 1C Bitrix.</i> </blockquote><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Lyrical digression</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  If you want to build the same configuration for work, do not buy the word "1C" in its name, and do not call for setting up 1C specialists, do not even call me), go to a decent Linux forum and invite the backbone provider admin to set up VPN and WWW.  These people do such things with flies on the fly ... that your servers will fly no worse.  Do not forget to make archives only. <br></div></div><br><h4>  ... and only I froze in the midst of all this magnificence ... how I was beaten ... </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8v/wj/vx/8vwjvxoawfxb5_ddqls4hrovm-8.jpeg"><br><blockquote>  <i>... you ask without respect, you do not offer friendship, you did not even call me godfather.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The godfather</i> </blockquote>  Namely, when I received the coupon, I had to write in reply: I agree with using $ 150 USD coupon to my account, I did not do that ... well, I did a little overclocking with the configuration. <br><br>  Hope we still make it up. <br><br><h4>  So at this point the story ends and it's time to take a full summary. </h4><br>  Alibaba Cloud's Elastic Compute Service is an excellent choice for hosting a virtual infrastructure, both for IT gourmets and for general users. <br><br>  While not well studied and presented in our country, therefore, a small share of adventurism is present in this decision. <br><br>  Its further development in Russia probably depends on ourselves.  Who does not risk, he does not drink champagne. <br><br>  May Europe overtake the EMEA region of the Middle East and Africa. <br><br>  I recommend it at least for viewing to all who read this article, as a model of technical excellence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_j/uf/6b/_juf6b4c0_kr131lvjcjus9pxgi.jpeg"><br><br>  May Eastern wisdom and prosperity be with you. <br><br>  And yes, I do not refuse my words, write, I will give you the contacts of the manager of the EMEA region, Mr. Leo Liu. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Test results from 1C</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fd/7w/py/fd7wpyw1lpedn4iuovkr4s66d-m.png"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ne/oz/4n/neoz4necwbmh8lhntm-dt8g7jxy.png"></a> <br></div></div><br>  The article continues the cycle of cloud platform tests: <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440594/">1C and Yandex.
