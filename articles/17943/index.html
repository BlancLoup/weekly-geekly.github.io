  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WebMoney Transfer - Hot 10-ka</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article in its original form is here. <br>  <a href="http://owebmoney.ru/2007.shtml">owebmoney.ru/2007.shtml</a> <br>  one <br>  Nietzsche was truly right when he said: ‚ÄúCarrying your gold with you in un-rolled form is associated with inconveniences;  so does the thinker, devoid of formulas. "  Since July 2007, WebMoney users can store their gold in the form of minted electronic coins on new G-wallets.  And this is the main event of the year, according to the version of WebMoney.Ru.  A new type of title characters - WMG - has already been liked by businessmen as a way to preserve and increase their capital.  No wonder, because each WMG is provided with 1 gram of real gold stored in the form of ingots.  And gold, as you know, is the most liquid material.  By the way, once again the decision on the establishment of a new Guarantor and a new type of wallets was made at a universal vote of certified WebMoney members.  "For" expressed more than 95%. <br>  2 <br>  The second place of the New Year charts goes to the WM Keeper Classic developers for accuracy and speed. <a name="habracut"></a>  During the past year, as many as 5 new versions of Keeper came out.  And let it not always do without bugs and glitches (which, however, are almost immediately corrected), but this disadvantage is more than worth the good intentions to make the lives of users easier.  Among the innovations of the latest versions are convenient wizards instead of dialog boxes, time-protected translations, support for hot keys, WM-card redemption directly from Keeper, the function ‚Äúreturn payment‚Äù, new icons and design. <br><br>  3 <br>  oWebMani.Ru has not yet had time to write about WebMoney Advisor, but many system users have already managed to assess the usefulness of this ‚Äútool‚Äù on their own.  WM Advisor is a browser-based toolbar (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Netscape Navigator) that knows everything about the sites you visit.  Advisor will tell you whether you can trust the web resource, whether there are positive or negative reviews about it.  The functional menu of the Advancer will allow you to: view information about the site owner, leave your feedback or complaint about it, quickly get into any of the many WebMoney services. <br><br>  four <br>  Literally at the close of a year, WebMoney caught a pleasant surprise, from which it was not expected at all.  The conservative banking get-together recognized the merits of WMT and presented the National Banking Award - the main industry award - in the nomination ‚ÄúThe Best Online Payment System‚Äù.  What is especially nice is that not a limited circle of judges acted as a jury in this nomination, to the entire Internet community, which chose the best payment system by voting.

      five <br>  In August 2007, the system recorded 4 million registrations.  The army of WebMoney fans is replenished daily with 5,000 new users, and these rates are only increasing.  Therefore, oVebMani.Ru undertakes to suppose that next year the system will overcome two successive million-mile thresholds and reach 6 million registrations.  With each new million, such an event can be considered less significant and more and more everyday.  Therefore, this year - only 5th place. <br><br>  6 <br>  Fans of making quick payments from any place they didn‚Äôt seem to have been able to evaluate the new version of the WebMoney client for GSM Keeper 2 mobile phones. Compared to version 1, it added the ability to pay standard WM-accounts, manage debit cards, work with Cyrillic, pay for cellular services operators and Internet providers, as well as improved graphical interface.  Now mobile Keeper is convenient to use on all modern phones, and for greater comfort, the developers offer two different modifications of the midlet for devices with different screen resolutions. <br><br>  7 <br>  In the past year, software developers have also got their own (they are also fans of shifting work onto the shoulders of robots).  3 new XML interfaces (X13, X14, X15) allow you to automatically return to the sender both regular and protected translations, as well as receive and modify the current trust settings without manual human participation.  A new digital signature module WMSigner version 2.X will significantly enhance security on sites that use XML interfaces. <br><br>  eight <br>  We give the 8th place not to a specific event, but to a whole chain of events that led to a mini-breakthrough WMU.  Over the year, many Ukrainian trading companies were connected to the WebMoney system, several direct deposit gateways were launched, more than one interesting project was announced, contracts were signed with a number of banks, and the number of U-purses replenishment points increased 8 times!  It can be predicted that all indicators of Ukrainian WM-units in the outgoing year increased by 3-4 times. <br><br>  9 <br>  WebMoney took part in the industry conference "Electronic Commerce - 2007", where it sponsored the event and presented a report on its latest developments.  And at the ‚ÄúE-finance 2007‚Äù exhibition, WMT did not limit itself to simply demonstrating its products: ‚Äúwithout departing from the cash register,‚Äù every visitor to the exhibition could receive a personal certificate for free, take a master class and win a cash prize or a valuable gift. <br><br>  ten <br>  The launch of the ‚Äúgolden‚Äù G-wallets together with the Guarantor from the United Arab Emirates is not the only step of the system towards the East.  The second significant step was the beginning of cooperation WebMoney and cashU system.  Residents of the UAE and 30 other countries in the Middle East and Africa were able to replenish WebMoney wallets with cashU prepaid cards through the service top-up.wmtransfer.com. <br><br>  Finally, we would like to sincerely congratulate you, our dear reader, with the upcoming New Year!  May peace and understanding always reign in your family.  Let any business which you undertake be going on.  Let life not stand still, let old dreams come true faster and new ones appear in their place. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17943/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17943/</a></p>
