    <h2>  1. Serverless technologies will evolve </h2><br>  Serverless technologies <a href="https://blog.g2crowd.com/blog/trends/digital-platforms/2018-dp/serverless-computing/">allow</a> developers to abstract from infrastructure management and focus on developing and deploying applications.  This is possible thanks to automation: the provider company takes control of the <a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/services/iaas/iaas-vmware-virtual-infrastructure/">virtual infrastructure</a> that is needed to run and scale applications.  In this case, you need to pay only for the time and resources that are used here and now. <br><br>  According <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/function-as-a-service-market-127202409.html">to</a> MarketsandMarket, in 2016, the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) market was estimated at $ 1.88 billion.  At the 2017 ServerlessConf conference, Jason McGee (Jason McGee), vice president and technology director of the IBM Cloud, <a href="http://blog.spotinst.com/2017/05/01/spotinsts-ceo-takeouts-serverlessconf-2017/">said</a> that the value of the FaaS market will increase 7‚Äì10 times by 2021.  MarketsandMarket <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/function-as-a-service-market-127202409.html">says</a> that this is a rather optimistic forecast and give an estimate of $ 7.72 billion. <br><br>  As <a href="https://blog.g2crowd.com/blog/trends/digital-platforms/2018-dp/serverless-computing/">noted</a> in the G2 Crowd, serverless computing technology has begun to gain popularity in the past 2 years.  The peak of the interest of organizations to FaaS came at the end of 2017, so we can assume that in 2018 many companies will switch to serverless technologies. <br><br>  G2 Crowd reports that FaaS technologies <a href="https://blog.g2crowd.com/blog/trends/digital-platforms/2018-dp/serverless-computing/">will be useful</a> for servicing IoT solutions.  In this area, flexibility and speed of deployment are the most significant factors for the success of a project. <br><br>  From the point of view of information security, FaaS will help reduce the risks of organizations through a more comprehensive approach to providing security from the provider.  This is evidenced by a number of information security specialists, such as Guy Podjarny, CEO of Snyk ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCiyUD_rI8D8">video of</a> his speech on the topic). <br><br>  Of course, we don‚Äôt have to talk about mass use of technology in 2018, but the mentioned analytical data show that this market will develop steadily over the next 4‚Äì5 years. <br><br><h2>  2. The popularity of NoSQL will grow </h2><br>  According <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp%3FcontainerId%3DprUS41826116">to</a> IDC, the total market value of Big Data analytics will exceed $ 203 billion by 2020 (for comparison: in 2016 the market was estimated at 130 billion).  The development of this trend can be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2017/01/20/6-predictions-for-the-203-billion-big-data-analytics-market/%25235deb62642083">explained by the</a> need of companies for storing and processing large amounts of data. <br><br>  However, working with Big Data implies something more than analyzing huge amounts of information.  It also includes the processing of data that is regularly updated and comes from various sources.  To solve these problems, more and more NoSQL databases are used. <br><br>  NoSQL is a relatively <a href="https://tdwi.org/articles/2016/10/21/5-reasons-nosql-adoption-is-booming.aspx">new</a> technology, because for some time it experienced certain implementation difficulties and encountered technical errors.  For example, in 2015, 40 thousand NoSQL MongoDB databases <a href="http://www.information-age.com/major-security-alert-40000-mongodb-databases-left-unsecured-internet-123459001/">were</a> unprotected from attacks - hackers needed only to scan TCP ports 27017 to find ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù databases. <br><br>  Since then, the technology has become more secure - as Forrester <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-named-a-leader-in-forrester-wave-big-data-nosql-q3-2016">noted</a> in its report for 2016, in which they gave an analysis of 15 large NoSQL-vendors.  NoSQL solutions are now also supplied with management tools that simplify database scanning and improve scaling.  Today, the NoSQL database is even used by companies from Fortune 500: UPS, GE Capital, AXA - and they use NoSQL to work with business-critical applications. <br><br>  Russian companies also pay attention to technology.  For example, as early as 2016, Mail.Ru <a href="http://www.iksmedia.ru/news/5454848-Nazvany-glavnye-ITtrendy-2018.html">began</a> working with big data to create predictive models, conduct marketing research and consultancy in the field of infrastructure development.  For this purpose, open solutions were used - Apache Hadoop and Spark - and the company's own developments, in particular, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantool">Tarantool</a> NoSQL database. <br><br>  TechRepublic <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-things-you-should-know-about-nosql-databases/">notes</a> that NoSQL will adapt an increasing number of companies.  Flexible scaling through virtualization and the ability to store and process more data ‚Äúfor less money‚Äù (compared to RDBMS) are the main advantages of NoSQL.  Thanks to these features and high performance (thanks to <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/MPP-massively-parallel-processing">MPP</a> ), the global NoSQL market <a href="https://www.marketresearchmedia.com/%3Fp%3D568">will reach</a> $ 3.4 billion already in 2024.  The average annual growth will be 21%. <br><br><h2>  3. The popularity of object storages will also increase. </h2><br>  Adrian Herrera, vice president of marketing for Caringo, <a href="https://www.caringo.com/blog/object-storage-predictions-2018/">notes</a> that in 2018 there will be more government initiatives aimed at protecting personal data (like <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585">GDPR</a> ), as well as technologies for secure data storage. <br><br>  At the same time, as <a href="https://www.keyinfo.com/3-trends-cloud-object-storage/">noted</a> in IDC, the amount of information will increase rapidly: by 2020, the amount of data generated by mankind will reach 44 zettabyte. <br><br>  Therefore, object storages are becoming increasingly popular in the market.  Files in such storage are accompanied by metadata that allow processing these files as application objects: documents, projects, photographs, etc. Such storage facilities have architecturally unlimited storage capacity and are capable of ensuring high availability of information (due to universal processing of arbitrary data) and high reliability of storage. <br><br>  Due to the advantages of obj-storage, many cloud vendors have integrated them into their solutions: backup systems (Acronis Backup, <a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/company/news/it-grad-zapustil-uslugu-oblachnoe-khranilishche-dlya-rezervnogo-kopirovaniya-veeam-cloud-connect/%3Fsphrase_id%3D2496">Veeam Backup and Replication</a> , NetApp AltaVault), ERP-systems (SAP, 1C) and CMS-systems (1C-Bitrix, Wordpress) and other <br><br>  Object storage is already used by companies such as Netflix, Sony, BMW, CERN, and others. And the market for cloud-based object-based data storage, according to <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/cloud-object-storage-market-4202">forecasts by</a> Market Research, will reach $ 6 billion by 2023, with a CAGR of 14%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u3/aa/tf/u3aatfeyltbxs3tktrfksirdcna.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/trekkyandy/32411334526/">Andy Melton</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  4. Multi-cloud will combine workloads </h2><br>  According <a href="https://www.idc.com/research/viewtoc.jsp%3FcontainerId%3DUS41863916">to</a> IDC, in 2018, 85% of companies will switch to a multi-cloud architecture.  The main reason for this, Seth Robinson, a CompTIA analyst, <a href="https://www.comptia.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/2014/11/03/as-cloud-computing-barriers-fall-new-challenges-arise-for-organizations-new-comptia-study-concludes">believes</a> that each company has its own individual needs. <br><br>  In this regard, there is already an active growth in the supply of IaaS, able to meet the requirements of organizations.  The global IaaS market is <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/infrastructure-as-service.asp">expected to reach</a> $ 56 billion by 2020, with a CAGR of 29%. <br><br><blockquote>  At the same time, the domestic IaaS market is also ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù.  The results of the CNews rating <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/reviews/cloud2017/articles/iaas_prishel_na_rossijskij_rynok_vsled_za_saas">show</a> that in 2016 the revenue of the ten largest IaaS suppliers grew by 76%: from 3.8 billion rubles to 6.7 billion. Then IT-GRAD (1.16 billion rubles) became the leader in terms of revenue. . </blockquote><br>  In addition to the need to meet the individual needs of organizations, the reason for the growing interest in multi-cloud is the growing popularity of data protection and automation - so they say in Juniper.  Therefore, security <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/02/19/juniper_spring_range_reveal/">has become</a> one of the main strategic directions for the development of Juniper in 2017‚Äì2018, and the company has been working on automation for many years (you can <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/346036/">read</a> about the recent results of this work in our blog). <br><br>  The company specifically began to <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/02/19/juniper_spring_range_reveal/">offer</a> new options for virtual data centers: the vSRX security platform and the vMX virtual router can now be deployed in a cloud environment (for example, in Azure).  This will help users create secure connections to public clouds for data centers and branches. <br><br><h2>  5. IoT will ‚Äúpush‚Äù the development of peripheral computing </h2><br>  The growing popularity of mobile and IoT devices requires a new approach to data processing.  This approach in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2018/01/23/moving-to-the-edge-evolving-iot-data-storage-in-2018/%252376c127f241a5">Forbes</a> and <a href="http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/opinion/Mobile-technology-drives-edge-computing-forward">TechRepublic</a> consider edge computing. <br><br>  According <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-edge-computing-means-for-infrastructure-and-operations-leaders/">to</a> Gartner, now about 10% of all corporate data is processed at the edge.  By 2022, this figure will be 50%.  Peter Levine (Peter Levine), a venture capital investor and partner of Andreessen Horowitz, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dl9tOd6fHR-U">predicts a</a> rise in peripheral computing, since unmanned vehicles, drones and robots will soon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/edge-computing-could-push-the-cloud-to-the-fringe/">need a</a> very fast exchange of information, and a significant share of computing power will be in the final IoT devices. <br><br>  Even large organizations start working with edge computing.  For example, Microsoft, last year the company introduced Azure Stack, a solution for deploying Azure services in a data center. <br><br>  According <a href="https://press.trendforce.com/press/20180122-3053.html">to</a> TrendForce, the average annual growth rate of the peripheral computing market from 2018 to 2022 will be 30%.  And Market Research Future <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/edge-computing-market-3239">predicts</a> that the cost of edge computing will reach $ 19.4 billion by 2020, with a CAGR of 18%. <br><br><hr><br>  PS Other predictions in our blog on Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/341374/">6 IT infrastructure trends: forecast for 2018</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/344590/">AI systems in 2018: six predictions</a> </li></ul><br>  PPS A few more articles from the First Corporate IaaS blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/legal-issues-of-using-cloud-technologies-by-financial-organizations/">Legal issues of using cloud technologies by financial organizations</a> </li><li> <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/evolution-vmware-vmotion/">VMware vMotion Evolution: yesterday, today, tomorrow</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/kompaniya-jotun-razmestila-svoyu-infrastrukturu-v-iaas-oblake-it-grad/">IaaS-cloud "IT-GRAD": the case of the company JOTUN</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350356/</a></p>
