And you wonder why?  To reflect the result in your resume?  To assess your level?  Such resources will not offer you anything except low-quality questions and dubious achievements.  Their goal is to make a profit on the seal of certificates that are worthless in the professional environment.  To get the result you need <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If you have not heard about ZCE, let me tell you.  This is a <a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend</a> certification.  Let me remind you that Zend is developing a <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> programming <a href="http://php.net/">language</a> and related solutions.  What could be better than a certificate issued by a company that produced the programming language in which you write?  Passing the exam tells a potential or current employer that you know a <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php5-certification">lot of scary words</a> . <br><br>  I want to talk about how to get a Zend certificate and the proud title of Zend Certified Engineer.

It is very desirable to read it, because it sets out the basis necessary for the exam.  Just want to say that just reading a couple of books on PHP is not enough.  Real work experience in the field of web-programming is required, this can be understood by purchasing a package of trial tests, there in <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/store/php-certification/">the Zend store</a> .  Moreover, the acquisition of test tests is very desirable in any case - this will allow you to evaluate your knowledge, the level of questions and the breadth of the topic covered by the exam questions. <br><br>  Returning to the book, it is worth mentioning that it is available only in English.  This should not be frightened, because almost entirely the text is based on a set of simple phrases that can be translated into Russian as: ‚Äúin the example below‚Äù, ‚Äúas we found out in the previous chapter‚Äù, ‚Äústarting with PHP 5.xx‚Äù.  When reading in the subway (and I get to work for 27 minutes) and, sorry, figuratively speaking, it took me four days on the toilet.  By the way, preparing for the exam is a good way to systematize the existing knowledge. <br><br>  I passed the trial tests one at a time, one more, I think, does not make sense, because the brain just gets tired.  After the delivery of each result is displayed, not detailed, of course, but generally understandable: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/031/a43/f11/031a43f11575a09582eaa32a08e7f0fd.png" width="450" height="310" alt="Sample Test Results" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  It is worth saying that the test language is already more complicated than in the Zend PHP5 Certification Guide, although it is also quite easy to translate. <br><br>  When you decide that you are ready, you can attend to the exam itself.  Zend certification is conducted by <a href="http://www.vue.com/">Pearson Vue</a> .  In Moscow, <a href="http://www.interface.ru/">Interface.ru</a> collaborates with Pearson Vue, to which I turned.  With the manager, we have chosen the right day and time.  At the appointed hour, I came, paid on the spot and proceeded, in fact, to the exam. <br><br>  Honestly, I thought I wouldn‚Äôt pass - the exam questions were so different from the test test questions, but as it turned out, the doubts were in vain.  Probably the role played by excitement.  After all, this is a real exam in which you risk your hard-earned 125 US presidents (+ $ 5 when you pass on Interface.ru). <br><br>  The exam will answer 70 questions within 90 minutes.  The truth is that when they pass in Moscow they promise to add another 30 minutes for the difficulty.  The difficulty lies in the fact that certification is also in English.  The truth is really spent no more than an hour. <br><br>  Answers to questions are of three types: <br>  1. Choose one answer among several. <br>  2. Select multiple answers. <br>  3. Write your own version. <br><br>  In the third variant, it is necessary to write the names of functions, methods of classes, names of design patterns, output options of the provided scripts.  This type of questions is the most cunning.  It should be said that the register matters.  You need to write a response in compliance with the register, or, in extreme cases, if in doubt, in lower case.  Brackets for functions and methods can be omitted. <br><br>  When reporting the result of the change, the software is not verbose and is limited to one phrase.  More precisely by two, but I saw only one: ‚ÄúCongratulation!  You have passed the exam! ‚ÄùOr something like that. <br><br>  On the Zend website in the <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/store/education/certification/yellow-pages.php">Zend's Yellow Pages</a> section, I appeared only five days later, the paper version of the certificate will have to wait another month. <br><br>  At the time of this writing, there are only 27 certified specialists in Russia.  In the west, programmers are practically forced to take the exam, and our future is in our hands. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20479/</a></p>
