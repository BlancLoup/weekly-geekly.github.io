This year there are other interesting targets for stores, such as Juno - the NASA automatic interplanetary station launched to study Jupiter, the Olympic Games in Brazil, the presidential election in the USA.  In 2015, Criteo increased revenue in the 3rd quarter by $ 1.2 billion, thanks to more than 9,000 advertisers and 11,000 publishers working with us.  We have high expectations in 2016, as we continue to expand our customer base and successfully increase the number of revolutionary products for search engines, email and cross-device advertising.  I am pleased to share with you this report highlighting the main trends that, in our opinion, will have a great impact on e-commerce this year.  I hope that you, like me, will be interested in these trends.  Happy reading and successful year! <br>  <b>Eric Heichmann, CEO of Criteo</b> <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/864/c65/d37/864c65d37735413ba819a4efcc2b517a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/354/d1f/790/354d1f7907bc4f7291b4398bf26a1d72.jpg" align="left"><br><h5>  <b># 1 Buyer</b> </h5><br>  Will make purchases on a variety of mobile devices.

As soon as this figure crosses the 50% mark in 2016, sellers will have to upgrade their online sales experience with respect to a new reality.  20% more likely that the purchase will complete exactly the buyer using mobile devices, rather than the usual buyer. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> retailers will have to rework their online sales experience to take into account the fact that most users visit their site using multiple devices.  All applications and advertising campaigns must be activated and adapted on all devices, both mobile and stationary. <br>  Share of mobile e-commerce transactions <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f2/f4e/924/4f2f4e9249094a8b86a8ab36157a82ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/706/d64/759/706d64759b104fa491a8f2b13eafe205.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the moment, for the majority of consumers, mobile phones, especially smartphones, whose large screen makes online shopping more comfortable, are at the first place in terms of convenience.  More than 40% of e-commerce transactions occur in smartphones in Japan and South Korea.  In the UK, Germany, France and Russia, the share of smartphones involved in online purchases is steadily catching up with the use of tablets. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> Since the proportion of transactions carried out with a smartphone increases, sellers need to prioritize the promotion of mobile applications and optimize the shopping process with the phone.  While on tablets, people can use websites that are not optimized for mobile devices, it is extremely important for smartphones to have a special mobile application or to optimize the website itself for viewing on the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8c/e93/8b4/a8ce938b4a524412b2c180038ecfbdf3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39f/048/089/39f04808904942189a78c0debe86365b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Currently, Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday in the USA is the largest trading day of the year in e-commerce ($ 3 billion in sales).  In turn, the Bachelor's Day, celebrated on November 11 in China, is the largest selling day in the world, when, for example, only Alibaba sold $ 14.3 billion, which is 60% more than last year.  These biggest online shopping days in 2016 will give you even more sales. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : sellers will need to balance strategies for online and offline sales for these biggest trading days of the year.  On such peak days, retailers using an integrated model strategy should expect more traffic in online stores rather than offline. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a3/09b/aef/0a309baef8ab4b69833acfcdcb94051d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e0/791/880/2e07918806bd4492a29d87618138e649.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since most consumers are currently investigating the subject of future purchases online before visiting the store, understanding the priorities of online shoppers is vital for retailers.  According to Google, 8 out of 10 buyers with a smartphone use it in an offline store to help themselves with the choice, although most of them later make purchases in a regular store, and not via the Internet.  Vendors are beginning to gain a greater understanding of customer preferences and choices by interacting with them through a mobile application or / and with the help of technology to find customer ID and email correspondence and use the loyalty program at an offline point of sale. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : Since vendors are investing in these technologies, they need to be sure that they have enough expert knowledge and operational resources created to manage customer interactions in real time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/707/eae/579/707eae579ed348b1b7208ac97b211473.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc1/2d4/b12/fc12d4b12d5f4f5eabd7af77ae31744a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Only a few companies today can effectively use customer data from all devices and platforms.  Even with today's possible probable and definite match, most vendors are still engaged in cross-device marketing and track customer movement through applications and browsers.  In 2016, marketers will make it their task to understand how customers navigate sites on different mobile devices, platforms and publishers.  Consequently, we will see that it has become obvious that marketing is now focused on the behavior of living people. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> buyers do not think about their media consumer activity using devices, browsing in browsers or publishers - marketers do not think about it either.  B2C companies need to restructure their marketing moves in order to fully understand the intentions and desires of the consumer.  And also look into the area free to navigate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e64/520/d6a/e64520d6a515456c8fbda101772de2b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/888/250/64c/88825064cd8a4410ab89baf34c2425cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The annoying pop-ups, overlays and commercials before the video - all these tricks are gradually disappearing, especially on mobile devices.  Consumers expect unobtrusive advertisements and personalized content, and advertisers must provide this.  Ad blocking will also speed up the transition to the unobtrusive ad format.  Good news?  According to Adblock Plus, 75% of users do not mind receiving unobtrusive advertising. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion: the</b> transition to unobtrusive and appropriate to the interests of the client's advertising will help advertisers to achieve genuine interaction with consumers, as well as lead to an increase in conversion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbc/a56/00b/dbca5600bb18449b8bdfb2badeec67cb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c3/653/b9e/4c3653b9e0434af5b16b97ba5b454bc1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The order fulfillment process will have a high priority for companies in 2016, offering a huge number of delivery options that correspond to Amazon‚Äôs premium delivery service.  Both online and offline sellers will attempt to implement this type of delivery using specialized third parties, such as Instacart.  Fast delivery at lower costs will also stimulate the growth of cross-border purchases (cross border), because to save money, consumers will be happy to make purchases from other countries. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> salespeople who ship on the day of ordering or even faster will enjoy a significant competitive advantage in 2016.  This trend will also attract a large number of advertisers to borrow the style of "instant" advertising and conversions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b85/550/06a/b8555006a9314097b02dc14c8fcca7ae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/944/9c6/da1/9449c6da13374695976f28ad186a0113.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  2016 will be another exciting year for e-commerce, but there are also serious problems.  Merchants and advertisers should consider the following questions to make their best for the prosperity of ecommers this year: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78d/381/fd9/78d381fd9f81470aba527ba345437cf0.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Advertisers should focus on understanding the consumer route on all devices, browsers and applications, as well as provide a single customer perception of the site of all devices and channels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b24/bfd/f2b/b24bfdf2b2334252bb6da5d050f2c4a8.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Vendors should pay more attention to online sales opportunities during large trading periods, such as Black Friday and Cyber ‚Äã‚Äã- Monday.  Consumers are increasingly buying online to avoid crowding and queuing in stores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c54/72a/b5e/c5472ab5e636463db972850d77aa82af.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  The massive increase in mobile sales generated by smartphones.  Investing in mobile apps is worth it, as it can bring a significant boost in sales. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb4/432/aea/bb4432aea3594d94957c87f939e53697.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Advertisers should search for a technical partner who can optimize online conversions by providing personalized and unobtrusive advertisements for full interaction with consumers. <br><br>  Many changes have appeared on the horizon of consumer expectations, retail investments and marketing strategies.  Social media will continue to have a big impact on online shopping, and improving mobile payment services will also contribute to the growth of e-commerce in 2016. <br><br>  Subscribe to our blog, then there will be a lot of interesting things. <br>  By the way, we are doing logistics for online stores here, if anything, maybe someone needs it? <br>  Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br><br><hr><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99f/dd1/e17/99fdd1e179c04948b9c7a06a27087b7b.jpg" alt="image"></a> </div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302306/</a></p>
