      Perhaps, this corresponds to the speeds at which the JavaScript-world itself lives: the second Angular will not have time to leave, as the fourth one is already announcing.  And thanks to this, JS is not boring.  But when rushing headlong into the future, it is easy to forget about the past and lose sight of the big picture.  Therefore, in the announcement, we looked at the history of technology and the previous HolyJS, to see everything in perspective - starting as early as 1988. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Program </h2><br><h3>  1988 </h3><br>  Before the company Pixar became famous with the "Toy Story", its product was not the animation itself, but the technology to work on it.  Seven years before ‚ÄúHistory,‚Äù she published the ‚ÄúRenderMan Interface Specification, Version 3.0‚Äù specification.  And, according to Wikipedia, this text first introduced the society to the word ‚Äúshader‚Äù in its modern sense. <br><br>  Later, shaders began to play a crucial role in video games and CGI.  And now they declare themselves in the browser: and in games, and not only.  And at the last Moscow HolyJS, <b>Denis Radin</b> spoke on the topic ‚ÄúUI-components on pixel shaders, we write your first shader‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pb/po/io/pbpoiohobyrkira7f8ynru9ldby.jpeg"><br><br>  What does all this have to do with the next HolyJS in Petersburg?  Such: Denis will also perform on it.  The topic of his next report has not yet been defined, so the word ‚Äúshader‚Äù may not sound in it, but Denis works at Evolution Gaming on photo-realistic web games using React and WebGL - which means we should expect something ideologically close. <br><br><h3>  2000 </h3><br>  This year, another well-known company put into circulation another popular term.  In January 2000, Microsoft first used the phrase "cross-site scripting", which later began to be reduced to "XSS". <br><br>  Now this term may seem like a greeting from the past: well, yes, there are such attacks, but now they can be taken by surprise unless they are just a beginner, right?  Not true.  As it turns out, in the first quarters of 2017, the number of reports of XSS attacks grew - that is, everyone seems to know everything, but this does not mean that everyone really gives battle to vulnerabilities. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Bogachuk</b> told about this and other security issues in JS at the last HolyJS.  And he talked in such a way that he became one of the two leaders on the #HolyJSTopSpeaker twitter hashtag, he liked the audience very much.  It is obvious that after this he had to be called again.  We did just that, so in May, Alexey will again come to us from Belarus - already with a new report. <br><br><h3>  2006 </h3><br>  Eleven years ago in Germany, <b>Vitaly Friedman</b> and <b>Sven Lennarz</b> created the Smashing Magazine website dedicated to web design and web development.  Over the years, it has become the most popular and influential resource on this topic (for example, the number of followers on Twitter has already exceeded one million).  In addition to the site itself, there were books Smashing Book and events Smashing Conference.  It is difficult to recall another so loud resource for professionals in a particular narrow field (although it is not surprising that the main industrial site turned out for those who make websites). <br><br>  And recently, the site also has a massive redesign.  This is always fraught with technical problems, and complaints "doors-back-wall", and in this case, the best experts of the planet, who are able to notice any flaw, also followed what was happening.  But in the end, the reaction of most readers of the site to redesign was positive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fs/fx/sb/fsfxsbaj5dm3guf-75j-rmayeco.jpeg"><br><br>  I want to know all the details about such a successful case in order to learn valuable experience.  And the last Moscow HolyJS allowed to know them first hand: <b>Vitaly Friedman</b> shared something with us in an <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/342006/">interview</a> , and most of the details were in the report.  In addition, Vitaly also spoke with keynote about Responsive Web Design, having very much revived the whole hall.  As a result, it was he who became the second #HolyJSTopSpeaker - and he, too, will arrive at St. Petersburg's HolyJS. <br><br>  What topic will come with?  Vitaly offered the Program Committee a choice of six: <br><br><ol><li>  Big bang redesign </li><li>  New Adventures in Responsive Web Design </li><li>  Reaching For Stars: Why Images Matter </li><li>  Dirty Little Tricks From The Dark Corners Of Front-End </li><li>  Dirty Little Tricks From The Dark Corners Of Responsive Web Design </li><li>  Dirty Little Tricks From The Dark Corners Of eCommerce </li></ol><br>  The first two do not suit us: they are those that were in Moscow's HolyJS, and we try not to repeat the reports, even if the conference is in another city.  But which of the other four is better?  If any topic seems particularly attractive to you, say: the final decision will be made by the Program Committee, but the comments will be taken into account there.  For me personally, for example, it seems more interesting than other eCommerce variants (it is not often said about eCommerce at conferences, but the topic is relevant for many). <br><br><h3>  2009 </h3><br>  On November 8, 2009, at JSConf EU, Ryan Dahl introduced Node.js.  Then it was ‚Äúanother new project‚Äù, he proposed an ambitious idea ‚ÄúJS on the server‚Äù, and there was no giant company behind him with great resources to implement bold ideas - well, in general, it was unlikely that many people thought that the project had a great future.  To say that he instantly captured the world is also impossible: in the first years of its existence, Node was interested in individual enthusiasts (among such enthusiasts <a href="https://vk.com/wall66748_6469">were</a> , for example, one of the VKontakte developers). <br><br>  But in 2017 it would be foolish to deny the success of the project.  So it is not surprising that HolyJS does not overlook it: at the Moscow conference there were just three reports related to the topic.  One of them, ‚ÄúTroubleshooting Node.js Applications Under the Hood,‚Äù was from <b>Nikolai Matvienko</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/um/sj/d1/umsjd1hppxc8txsm40lwpnwk71a.jpeg"><br><br>  Nikolay is a full-stack JS developer, and, besides his own development, he is engaged in diagnosing, profiling and optimizing the performance of applications in production.  With such a range of tasks, an examination inevitably appears in a variety of topics - so it may well be that in Petersburg he will come up with a completely different topic. <br><br><h3>  2011-2014 </h3><br>  There is no end to the discussion of "JavaScript and types."  But you can take any point as its beginning.  October 10, 2011, when Dart from Google was presented at the Danish conference GOTO?  October 1, 2012, when Microsoft presented TypeScript?  Or on November 18, 2014, when ‚ÄúFlow, a new static type checker for JavaScript‚Äù post appeared on Facebook blog?  In any case, it is obvious that the current situation arose several years ago. <br><br>  <b>Ilya Klimov</b> , the owner of a small company Wookie Labs specializing in JS projects, spoke about this situation earlier in HolyJS.  And in this company it was decided to use ‚Äútyped JS‚Äù.  So, on HolyJS, Ilya, relying on personal experience, told me how TypeScript and Flow differ, why he considered Flow to be more appropriate, and what exactly Flow had.  Ilya will also be on the stage of St. Petersburg HolyJS.  In the meantime, we are determined with its new theme, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DetKOc80-cw0">see the</a> aforementioned previous report. <br><br><h3>  2015 </h3><br>  We have already mentioned Smashing Magazine in this text, but it brought fame not only to its creators.  Many consider the achievement ‚Äúmy text published Smash‚Äù, and a successful publication can produce a tangible resonance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5z/-p/wd/5z-pwdgbxkmpi6ube3e3g1zauvq.jpeg"><br><br>  In 2015, an article by <b>Denis Mishunov</b> in several parts of ‚ÄúWhy Perceived Performance Matters‚Äù appeared on Smashing Magazine: that the user‚Äôs perception of time may not coincide with cold timestamps from logs, and that affects it.  The text led, in particular, to the fact that in 2016 the very first performance of the very first HolyJS was Denis's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Di9cOoipvST8">keynote</a> on a similar topic.  A year later, at the next HolyJS, he spoke with the closing keynote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVGoWhHhYpQU">‚Äúdebugger;‚Äù</a> - a discussion about how we lose ourselves under an avalanche of technical information.  And quite recently, we decided that the 2015 article remains relevant (even if some individual things in it are outdated), so <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/343484/">two</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/343922/">parts</a> were translated specifically for Habr. <br><br>  The article has a third part (‚ÄúManagement of Patience‚Äù), which we will also translate - so wait for the new one.  And we had a lot of patience and are waiting for Denis at the conference in 2018 with a new report and new slides: Denis himself draws himself such illustrations that they <br>  You can admire even in isolation from the report, you can see for <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mishunov/debugger">yourself</a> . <br><br><h2>  Format </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/co/ia/ck/coiackkt-qegrtbno6puq6c8r2o.jpeg"><br><br>  Those who have already visited HolyJS do not really need to explain anything.  But for new viewers let you know what to expect in general: <br><br><ul><li>  The theme of the conference is ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù, not ‚Äúfrontend‚Äù.  This means that JS can be found here in any form: server (remember the same Node.js), mobile (we also had a talk about React Native recently), even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D39MiUkGSEks">told</a> about WebVR. </li><li>  We love hardcore, so reports can ‚Äúclimb into the gut‚Äù and be demanding of the listener.  But do not be afraid: there are reports of the ‚Äúintroduction to technology‚Äù format, which do not imply prior acquaintance with it.  At the conference it will be easy to find the right one for you, because everything will be marked with the appropriate icons: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/un/a9/zu/una9zu6g8a3sxa2dic1_tlc_yjq.png"></li><li> The most important component of the conference is the discussion areas.  Each speaker after his report does not just answer quickly a few questions, but moves to a specially designated place where there is time to properly question him (as it looks, seen in the photo above).  So there is not just a one-sided flow of information from experts, but detailed dialogues with them, and you can clarify all the interesting details - the main thing is not to be timid. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Online streaming </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bb/8h/qr/bb8hqrfxfeitokj4ao1y9i5p9vg.jpeg"><br><br>  All conference reports can be viewed online by <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/tickets/">purchasing the appropriate ticket</a> .  Such a broadcast has even a slight advantage over the live presence: if at the beginning of the report you suddenly realize that for some reason it does not fit, it is easier to switch to another room than to run between them. <br><br>  We are making a broadcast not for the first time, but from year to year it becomes only more beautiful.  Here are some recent improvements worth telling: <br><br><ul><li>  Video in 1440p - this allows you to simultaneously display the presentation of the speaker in FullHD, and the speaker himself, so it turns out how to admire each thin line on the graphs. </li><li>  Although the broadcast does not have access to the discussion areas, this does not mean that the audience does not ask any questions to the speakers at all.  You can write them in the <a href="https://t.me/holyjsconf">conference's Telegram chat</a> ‚Äî and if there is time left at the end of the talk, the trackers will set them up. </li><li>  And in the intervals between presentations, when the speakers and participants on the site are removed to the discussion areas, viewers of the online broadcast should not be bored.  Especially for them, we make separate content: interviews with speakers and sponsors. </li><li>  The sound quality has been improved, the recording system has been seriously reworked - you will hear well even the quietest speaker. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Call for Papers </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ob/06/db/ob06dbl7mt7gwe0kgm6nn5laoe8.jpeg"><br><br>  Do you want your name also associated with the development of technology?  Do you have a JS experience that could benefit others?  Are the people listed above close to you, and would you like to join their ranks?  Now is the time to <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/callforpapers/">apply</a> for a report! <br><br>  If you have not spoken before and do not quite understand what it will give you, you can read our January <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/319854/">post</a> , where several experienced speakers of our other conference presented their point of view. <br><br>  Not confident in your abilities?  Of course, our Program Committee ensures that only high-quality reports get to the conference, but at the same time it helps to make them better by sorting out the future report with the speaker and refining it.  So in this case, it is worthwhile not to postpone the question in the back box, but, on the contrary, hurry: the earlier you submit the application and the more time there is to work it out, the higher the chances of becoming one of the speakers. <br><br><h2>  To buy tickets </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gk/mc/z4/gkmcz45bst0dac2z-epjdlyynwk.jpeg"><br><br>  Registration is open, and now you can <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/tickets/">purchase a ticket</a> at an early bird-price.  And from January 1, the price will rise, so that a ticket can be a great way to indulge in the New Year, ultimately saving money.  And if you are going to go at the expense of the company, it also makes sense to figure it out right now: even if the company does not buy a ticket immediately, it can immediately take it into account in its plans for the 2018th. <br><br>  And if, according to the available information, you are not ready to make a decision, follow the <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/">website</a> , it will gradually be updated with new names of speakers and reports names. <br><br>  <b>See you at HolyJS 2018 Piter!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344758/</a></p>
