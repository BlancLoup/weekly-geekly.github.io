  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problems in the cultivation of good IT-specialists - Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I thought for a long time at my leisure about what was written in the first <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/86007/">topic</a> and decided to continue the discussion of this topic a bit, and pushed me to this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/86007/">comment</a> . <br><br>  The fact that such programs are often practiced in the West, I heard a little.  But the question arises of why it is impossible to arrange something like this in our country? <br><br>  I would venture to suggest that it is possible, because of the uniqueness of the mentality of our people, that a person who has achieved certain heights (status, money, etc.) is no longer interested in speaking to students in order to somehow become famous or earn respect.  And in turn, those who have not yet achieved anything significant spend all their efforts on achieving the above :), but not in this way.  Anyway, I suggest discussing this issue smoothly in a slightly different plane.  Namely, why not introduce such a practice, not on behalf of individuals, but on behalf of entire IT companies?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I am absolutely sure that what I will describe below has long been known to some and has long been used in practice.  Perhaps in the capitals and major cities, a similar approach is used, if not everywhere, quite often.  And so, the idea is for IT companies to organize a process of transferring experience to the younger generation, and first of all, of course, to students of computer science disciplines.  I am sure that some companies are following this policy, but for some reason have not heard of specific cases. <br><br>  The most banal and easiest way to implement the above is to take part of students from well-known universities to an IT company for an internship.  And all this should happen at the initiative of the company and not the university / students.  Naturally, the company will not be able and is unlikely to want to take on everyone in a row, especially if its size is not very large.  But all that is not necessary.  The simplest solution is to conduct some kind of seminar on behalf of the company, at which, in brief, competently tell about the company and about the type of activity, etc.  And in the end to arrange a small technical test questionnaire with the condition that a certain number of people who have scored the most points will be invited to the company for an internship.  Thus, the company, despite the apparent costs, gets IMHO a lot more advantages: <br><ol><li>  Fame.  I think on this point, everything is clear and true.  If at least a couple of hundred students find out about the company, then the benefits of this are unlikely to diminish.  I'm not talking about the fact that each of them can tell about the company to the N-th number of friends and acquaintances. <br></li><li>  Young professionals. <br></li></ol><br>  At paragraph 2, I propose to dwell and discuss in more detail.  Many companies are skeptical of this kind of shares and probably believe that it is much more profitable to search for experienced hardened specialists than to take beginners without experience, even promising and promising.  That's just at this point, I would argue very much.  First, as already mentioned, it is proposed to objectively select only the best of the best.  And the fact that they do not have serious experience in commercial projects, it seems to me fixable.  Perhaps another point that many companies seem to me to ‚Äúfear‚Äù is the fact that they say we will take these green and inexperienced boys, teach everyone what we know and pass on invaluable experience, investing a lot of time and money in them, and they will take in 1 fine day and will leave us back home or worse still to the closest competitors.  Well, excuse me in this way an experienced specialist who has already been hired can leave you, and no one is immune from this.  And very often this happens in life.  Man is a creature free and cannot be shackled at it :) Judge for yourself if you take a team of the most advanced students and train everything you need and then provide a job, we will be able to rally them pretty well.  What could be better than a team of peer specialists who have received their first serious work experience together.  I remember my first job and I can say that the very first experience is priceless.  And if you summarize all of the above, I think the chances that someone will want to leave the team are much less.  Of course, there is always the risk of leaving the entire team entirely, but something like this can happen only through the fault of the employer :) <br><br>  Let us hope that with time a lot more IT companies will take note of such practices of cultivating young specialists, the advantages of this approach seems to me obvious to both sides. <br><br>  Thank you all for your attention and good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86516/</a></p>
