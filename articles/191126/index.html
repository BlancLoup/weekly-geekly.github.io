The designer sells the picture to the client and he doesn’t care what is written there.  A client turns to copywriters, for inexpensively stamping “selling” delusions, sometimes assigns work to text marketers, sometimes headlines are composed by a whole department of female personnel managers, and they all have the inability to write in Russian, which seems to be an indispensable part of the profession.  As a result, it is pleasant for us to look at the site, but it is impossible to read.  Design is first of all the content, and then the scenery.  This is a review of the most obvious mistakes that should be followed by a vocabulary strike.  Do not switch. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  "The Internet" </h2><br>  People are still afraid of the Internet.  In the courtyard of 2013, technology develops so that hell follow, and people are still afraid of the Internet and write it with a capital letter.  The “Internet” is not a name, not a country, not a company name, it is such a worldwide network.  "InterNet" if you want.  We have already had a “copier”, “printer”, “smartphone”, “car” and many more closely related foreign words for a long time.  And for some reason, the web is endowed with divine greatness.

      You can often find a phrase (especially with Internet providers) of the type “Choose a tariff for connecting to the Internet”.  There is a lot of this, on various websites of various companies.  IT including.  Well, if any office for the supply of cow feed could be wrong.  But companies that are sitting in front of monitors for days can learn how to make their websites competently. <br><br>  Total: the word "Internet" can be operated the same way as, for example, the word "air".  Or "light."  Or "rain".  “Choose a tariff for connecting to the Internet”, but not “... for connecting to the Internet”.  None of you wrote “selling Smartphone with discounts”. <br><br><h2>  "Welcome!" </h2><br>  Bad meaningless headings and paragraph-greetings work in which there are many words, but this is not the case.  This is something like “Start your acquaintance with Pnitriks42 right now!” <br><br>  As a reader, I immediately have a couple of questions: <br>  1. Why shout?  I haven't done anything wrong yet. <br>  2. You can not right now and in a minute to go? <br>  Judging by the commanding tone of the title, they will not be allowed in a minute. <br><br>  “Call us on any of the phones convenient for you” <br>  Thank.  I thought it was you who are just showing off beautiful numbers. <br><br><h2>  Emotional stories about yourself </h2><br>  In one project, I got the texts about like this: <br>  “Our path of development and improvement has been going on for 3 years already!  Many peaks reached, but even more - in front!  And we are happy to direct our experience to achieve the result that our client is waiting for!  More than just a client!  This is how we treat anyone who turns into our company Krivogolholding.  Very many Clients who received high-quality services in our company become our friends, and some of them are partners! ” <br><br>  Hysterical style of narration is not touched yet.  From the paragraph you did not learn anything about the products of Krivogorholding, but you already figured out how many kilometers of texts you will have to turn to find at least something in the case.  Imagine that on the website "Eple" instead of the characteristics of an iPhone there will be a sheet that Johnny Ive thinks about the "Safari" icon and how he loves his customer.  I don't care if he loves me.  Let him love his job. <br><br>  Still, oddly enough, the example above gives a strategy to “push the merchant”.  It is assumed that my role as a customer is to buy something-there-they-sell, roll off and not delay the next one. <br><br><h2>  Lack of specifics </h2><br>  "Our company is one of the most successful on the market of web-studios of the city" <br>  Again questions: <br>  1. Who determines the most successful list?  How many such companies are in the city?  five?  thirty? <br>  2. If you are “one of”, then where are you at?  Are you only more successful than 3 or all 29? <br>  3. How do you determine your success?  Income per year?  Scale projects?  Do your sites increase their profits? <br><br>  When you see that the author begins to loop around generalized data (after all, he needs to score a place, and not convey information), then it’s time to think whether you are not lying.  “More than 50 projects in a portfolio” can mean that there are 51 of them. “More than 10 years of experience in the market” - that experience of 10 years and one month.  Of course, there is nothing critical in such speeds - if the product is of high quality, but it is not so important how much a person specifically and how many years he has been doing it.  But imagine that the price tags are not "1.84", but "from 1.00".  The metro is not going to Marshal Zhukov, but “not further than the final one”.  Heating will not include "October 15," and "in the middle of the quarter."  In such an uncertain world it would not be very calm. <br><br><h2>  Myth about “you” and respect </h2><br>  There is such a popular belief: “You” with a capital letter means respect, and if, forgive me, you wrote “you” with a small one, then, like, disrespect the reader.  I do not know how it went.  This is a half-truth regarding personal letters: you write “you”, if you want to show that you respect the interlocutor very much, and if you just want to write a letter and not show off, then you will come down.  No one will be offended.  But for public texts, the rule does not roll.  Firstly, this is not a personal correspondence, you are read everything.  Secondly, such a pseudo-respect clearly shows the desire to kiss the ass to every potential client.  There is such a technique in the domestic business - “cajole”. <br><br>  “The longer you are from Schmievstar, the bigger your bonus!” - follow us the followers of the “Love-Client” sect on the operator's website. <br>  “Whoever you are - a designer, advertiser or blogger, we will have images for everyone!” - write from a photo bank. <br>  “Our couriers will always deliver the goods to the place you specified!” - on the website of a large electronics store. <br><br>  Total: "You" with a big one only in a personal letter.  Show real respect for the reader - stop perceiving him a nerd. <br><br><h2>  Epilogue </h2><br>  When a client has nothing to write, or there is something to write, but he is shy of himself (well, for example, a small company wants to seem big), then he tries to get out of emotional pairing and sweeping stories about the eternal.  In the texts can be anything, but not about the product.  If about the product, it is not specifics, but “sales” of writings with a lot of blurry turns, which characterizes the attitude of the seller to their business, but in no way gives the buyer anything useful.  It would be nice to write more specific information about the product and less about yourself.  And for the latter is well suited personal blog or statuses in Vkontaktik. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191126/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191126/</a></p>
