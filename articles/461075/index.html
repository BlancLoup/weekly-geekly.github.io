IT objects, components, tools </h2><br>  I had the happiness (creativity) and misfortune (recognition and implementation) to develop a project of banking analytics.  Develop from idea to implementation and directly participate in all stages of development.  Most of all I liked the stage of setting and designing.  Turning chaos of ideas into a clear statement is a great pleasure.  Then, to transform the narrative of the performance into the constructiveness of the project is also a pleasure.  Well, in addition, he developed the software architecture and programmed.  This also contained its small charms, although at this stage each programmer had his own opinion and it was not easy to resolve contradictory views. <br><br>  I had to read a lot on banking, on financial instruments, on accounting, management and in-kind accounting, on business operations ... And, of course, on design and programming. <br><br>  So I wanted to share my views on business analytics.

      There is, of course, an even more important subject - business synthesis, dealing with the integration of analysis data and decision making.  ‚ÄúBut that's another story.‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Business objects analytics </h3><br><h4>  1.1.  Agents </h4><br>  These are relatively passive objects that make sense on their own.  Their examples: <br><br><ul><li>  People </li><li>  Enterprises </li><li>  Treaties </li><li>  Payment instruments </li><li>  Financial instruments </li><li>  Commodity Documents </li><li>  Product </li><li>  Financial instrument portfolio </li><li>  Portfolio of contracts </li></ul><br><h4>  1.2.  Operations, Actions </h4><br>  These are active objects to which the term ‚ÄúRun‚Äù is applicable and the execution of which leads to a change in the state of other objects.  Their examples: <br><br><ul><li>  Conclusion of an agreement </li><li>  Statement of invoice </li><li>  Payment </li><li>  Dismissal </li><li>  Suspension of the contract </li></ul><br>  Through operations, agents interact. <br><br><h4>  1.3.  Developments </h4><br>  These are signals of new information. <br><br>  Event classification: <br><br><ul><li>  Calendar: loan repayment has come, tomorrow is the birthday of the namerek ... </li><li>  Market: stock price A fell 5 points, competitor K went broke </li><li>  States: income tax increases by 2 percent from a certain date </li><li>  Politicians: economic sanctions are planned for such and such a state </li><li>  Conditions: indicator P exceeded the standard </li></ul><br><h4>  1.4.  Relations </h4><br>  By and large, everything can be represented as a relationship.  So the attributes of a business agent are the characteristics of his relationship to the physical world, to the economic, to the legal world ... For example, the gender of a person by birth is a person‚Äôs attitude to the biological world, citizenship is his attitude to the legal world.  The relational approach is also used in physics.  The mass of the fundamental particle is a consequence of the relationship of the interaction of the particle with the Higgs field.  Even with respect to space = time, there are relational theories. <br><br>  Relationship classification: <br><br><ul><li>  Legal </li><li>  Negotiated </li><li>  Own </li><li>  Possession </li><li>  Use </li><li>  Business relationship </li><li>  Bank service </li><li>  Competitive </li><li>  Cash </li><li>  Family </li><li>  Crime </li><li>  Love </li></ul><br>  Both visually and realistically, it is convenient to depict relationships with a directed loaded graph.  The orientation arises from the asymmetry of the relationship: A pays B does not mean that B pays A. The ribs are loaded, for example, with the following attributes: <br><br><ul><li>  Relationship type </li><li>  Relationship Date </li><li>  Relationship Last Activated Date </li><li>  Relationship size (payment, for example) </li></ul><br>  Nodes are loaded, for example, with the following attributes: <br><br><ul><li>  Object id </li></ul><br><h3>  2. Indicator </h3><br><h4>  2.1.  Definition </h4><br>  The indicator of an object is a certain characteristic of an object.  It is through indicators that an economic object is presented to the world of economics.  An indicator is an economic quantity, an analogue of a physical quantity.  From an information point of view, an object is a collection of indicators.  This combination is not absolute.  For different purposes, an object can be described by a different set of indicators. <br><br>  Having come from physics to programming economic problems and faced with the concept of an economic indicator, I was sure that there is a system of economic indicators.  A system in the sense as in the immortal phrase ‚ÄúThere is a system in his madness‚Äù.  I understood this system like this: <br><br><ul><li>  There is a fairly complete list of indicators, in which there are all independent indicators - the basis of indicators </li><li>  Definitions of indicators are given </li><li>  A certain rational and harmonious system of codification of indicators is given, so that it would be convenient for a person to apply codes in formulas </li><li>  All attributes of indicators are given. </li><li>  For derived indicators, calculation rules from basic </li><li>  Important relationships between indicators identified </li><li>  Indicator norm indicated </li><li>  Indicator guard set (condition for admissibility of value) </li><li>  The estimated values ‚Äã‚Äãof the indicator are given. </li><li>  Identified economic object </li></ul><br>  I began to search for such a system on the Internet.  However, no matter how many times I looked through textbooks and monographs, I did not find any system.  I came across the term ‚Äúbalanced scorecard‚Äù, but only talked about it, but I did not find a single complete example.  Therefore, I will give my understanding of the scorecard. <br><br><h4>  2.2.  Characteristics of indicators </h4><br>  There can be potentially infinitely many indicators.  The question is naturally about such a subset of indicators, on the basis of which any other indicator can be calculated.  Such a subset is called a <b>basis</b> .  It has the property of <b>completeness</b> : on the basis of it, any non-basic derivative indicator can be calculated.  The indicators included in it are independent of each other.  This property is called base <b>redundancy</b> . <br>  <b>The state</b> S (t) of the object at time t is all the indicators of the object at time t. <br>  <b>The motion</b> M (t) = {S (t1), ..., S (tn)} of an object is a change in the state of the object over time.  This is a set of states of an object over a time interval. <br>  Indicator <b>dynamics</b> - indicator values ‚Äã‚Äãsorted by time. <br><br>  Dynamics example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/im/ts/ou/imtsouozps09cjlwk6qiarxcsek.png"><br><br>  <b>The indicator trajectory</b> is a curve in several coordinate indicators, parameterized by time.  For example, for two indicators P, Q, this is a curve defined parametrically: P (t), Q (t). <br><br>  An example of a trajectory for indicators P, Q. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ji/gn/mv/jignmvwwsbllihfutabpfxzb2s0.png"><br><br>  Mugs - the value of indicators.  Arrows - the direction of increasing time. <br>  Having a trajectory, you can try to get a direct dependence of one indicator on another.  So, if at the moment t the exponent Q has the value q, and the exponent P has the value p, then the dependence of f of the exponent Q on P is such that f (p) = q.  The matter is only complicated by the fact that for different t, the same p can correspond to different q.  Then, most likely, there is no functional dependence. <br><br>  Similarly to two indicators, one can construct trajectories for an arbitrary number of indicators and use them to construct Q (P1, P2, ..., PT) dependencies.  But with the number of indicators more than three, visibility is lost. <br><br>  <b>State trajectory</b> - a set of trajectories of state indicators. <br><br><h4>  2.3.  Classification of indicators </h4><br>  <b>Indicator-flow</b> is a numerical indicator, the value of which is set on a time interval.  Examples: profit for a month, number of layoffs for a month, change in capital for a year, taxes paid for a quarter. <br><br>  <b>Indicator-state</b> - a numerical indicator, the value of which is set at a point in time.  Example: human growth, company capital, number of employees.  Examples: the number of employees at the beginning of the year, the capital of the enterprise at the beginning of the year, the assets of the enterprise at the beginning of the day. <br><br>  A change in an indicator for a certain period is an indicator-flow correlated with this period.  Examples of changes: change in capital for the quarter, change in price per day, ... <br>  If we fix one moment of time in the flow indicator, then we can talk about the indicator-state.  So we can talk about profit at the moment, bearing in mind the change in profit from the beginning of the year.  There is a fixed point in time - the beginning of the year. <br><br>  <b>Aggregate indicator</b> is an indicator whose value is an integral function of the values ‚Äã‚Äãof other indicators.  Examples: maximum, minimum, amount, average <br>  <b>External indicator</b> - an indicator of the external environment for the subject in question.  For example, for an enterprise it will be a market rate, prices, macroeconomic indicators. <br>  <b>Internal indicator</b> - an indicator of the subject in question. <br>  <b>Basic indicator</b> - an indicator belonging to the basis, i.e.  a set of indicators through which all others are expressed ... <br>  <b>Input stream</b> - a stream that sets the motion of the object being taken into account in the direction of the subject in question.  Example: interest received for a loan issued, payment for goods sold. <br>  <b>Output stream</b> - a stream that sets the motion of the object being taken in the direction from the subject in question.  Example: interest paid on the loan received, payment for the purchased goods. <br><br>  <b>Value type</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Text indicators.  Examples: names, addresses, codes. </li><li>  Dates  Examples: status date, date of birth. </li><li>  Logical indicators.  Examples: The end of the year?  Did the employee go to work?  Income exceeded expense? </li><li>  Numeric.  For them, arithmetic operations on the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the indicator at different times make sense. </li></ul><br>  Numeric differentiate by: <br><br><ul><li>  Cost.  These are numerical indicators, the measure of which is a monetary measure. </li><li>  Whole.  Examples: duration in days, number of employees. </li><li>  Fractional.  Examples: area, length, volume, duration, price </li></ul><br>  The indicator can be considered as an independent object.  Then it is characterized by certain indicators - indicator indicators or meta-indicators.  The first is inconvenient, the second is too learned, so we will call them the attributes of the indicator. <br><br>  <b>Attributes of a numeric metric</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  Code </li><li>  Name </li><li>  Unit of dimension </li><li>  Value </li><li>  Calculation rule </li><li>  Dimensional? </li><li>  Absolute? </li><li>  Additive? </li><li>  Sensitive to inflation? </li><li>  Monetary? </li><li>  Estimated? </li><li>  Basic? </li><li>  Limited by regulation? </li><li>  Normalized? </li><li>  Included in the basis? </li><li>  Natural / financial </li><li>  Stream / condition </li><li>  Primary / calculated </li><li>  External / internal </li><li>  Intensive / Extensive </li><li>  Stream / Status </li><li>  Input / Output </li></ul><br>  <b>Key attributes (coordinates) of the indicator</b> <br><br>  These are attributes that uniquely determine the value of an indicator in the set of all values ‚Äã‚Äãof all indicators. <br><br><ul><li>  The subject of the indicator is the subject characterized by the indicator </li><li>  Indicator currency - the currency in which the value of the value indicator is presented. </li><li>  Status date - the date on which the indicator value is determined </li><li>  Metric period - two dates (start date, end date) that specify the period for the flow metric </li><li>  Type of reality: plan, fact, forecast, scenario, test </li><li>  Script number </li><li>  Calculation method </li></ul><br>  Example: Income ('MAA', '947', '01/01/2012', '31 / 12/2012, '0,' 0 ',' 0 ') - the actual value of the 2012 income indicator of the MAA entity. <br><br>  In this case, the coordinates of the indicator: <br><br>  Income - code of the indicator ‚Äúincome‚Äù <br>  'MAA' - subject code for which the indicator is calculated <br>  '947' - currency code in which the income was generated <br>  '01 / 01/2012 '- the beginning of the income generation period <br>  '31 / 12/2012 '- the end of the income generation period <br>  '0' - reality code "Fact" <br>  '0' - script number ‚ÄúNo simulation‚Äù <br>  '0' - basic calculation method <br><br>  I saw systems in which the subject code was driven into the indicator code: KrsVltNB - exchange rate in the National Bank.  Extending this method, all coordinates can be driven into the indicator code.  ‚ÄúThere is a system in his madness,‚Äù isn't it? <br><br>  Example of an indicator description form: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/am/6i/ys/am6iys8qg75hnev4ora51scqbp8.png"><br><br><h4>  2.4.  Receive rule syntax </h4><br>  For programming, the clear formal syntax of the receive rule is important.  Then it is possible to build a rule interpreter that allows the user to enter new indicators with new rules himself.  It is important that the calculation rules fit into the implemented syntactical framework.  Otherwise, you have to modify the program.  Common operations allowed by the syntax: <br><br><ul><li>  Addition </li><li>  Subtraction </li><li>  Composition </li><li>  Private </li><li>  Power </li><li>  Time maximum </li><li>  Subject Maximum </li><li>  Minimum time </li><li>  Subject minimum </li><li>  Time amount </li><li>  Subject Amount </li><li>  Organizational Consolidation </li><li>  Time average </li></ul><br><h4>  2.5.  Codification of indicators </h4><br>  The codification problem is generated by a large number of codified objects.  If there are many objects, then the problem of their convenient codification becomes essential.  Small problems become big.  We need a system that introduces order, simplicity, and gives scalability to codification. <br><br>  Codification example.  Consider ways to codify a number. <br><br>  Roman way. <br>  I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI ... <br><br>  The coding system is rather obscure.  How to do arithmetic operations in this record?  There is no zero.  It is not clear how to code fractional numbers. <br><br>  Indian way. <br>  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 ... <br><br>  Any number is encoded in one way using ten digits.  The notation _n _ (n-1) ... _0 corresponds to the integer _n * „Äñ10„Äó ^ n + _ (n-1) * „Äñ10„Äó ^ (n-1) ... _0 * „Äñ10„Äó ^ 0.  This is clear and clear.  In such a record, it is easy to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and extract the square root.  All of this is taught at school.  The Indian way of writing numbers is a great example of the importance of notation, the importance of form. <br><br>  Quite natural <b>requirements for codification of indicators</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  Ergonomics </li></ul><br>  <b>Specific brevity</b> .  The more often the code is used, the shorter the code should be. <br>  <b>Continuity</b> with generally accepted designations. <br>  <b>Unified codification system</b> .  There should be no discrepancy in the codification system for different indicators or different types of indicators. <br>  <b>One-level sameness</b> .  ‚ÄúOne-level‚Äù in the sense of indicators should have the same length.  If A is an asset code, then it is logical for a liability to have a P code, not Passive, for example. <br><br><h4>  2.6.  Balanced Scorecard </h4><br>  Now the so-called Balanced Scorecard is well known.  Here's what Wikipedia says about her: <br><blockquote>  <sub>Balanced scorecard (balanced scorecard, BSC) - a strategic performance management tool, a partially standardized reporting form that allows managers to track the performance of tasks by employees, as well as the consequences of performance or non-performance.</sub>  <sub>The system is equipped with special design and automation methods.</sub> <sub><br><br></sub>  <sub>The term can correspond to both the system as a whole and the individual implementation of indicators.</sub>  <sub>The most important characteristics of the approach are:</sub> <sub><br><br></sub> <ul><li>  focus on the organization‚Äôs strategic agenda; </li><li>  selection of a small number of monitored data; </li><li>  combination of financial and non-financial data. </li></ul><br>  A balanced scorecard is an example of a feedback controller whose action is aimed at implementing a corporate strategy.  This type of controller involves measuring performance, comparing a metric with a reference value, and making adjustments if there is a gap.  Such control requires three prerequisites: <br><br><ul><li>  selection of data to be measured; </li><li>  setting reference values; </li><li>  fundamental opportunity to make adjustments. </li></ul><br>  In the context of strategic management, all three elements must flow from corporate strategy.  It is assumed that the control subject is able to both observe and intervene in the process.  In practice, this is not always fully practicable. <br><br>  There are two factors that make this kind of control easier.  First, the selection of data for monitoring can be simplified.  Secondly, only those data that correspond to the ability of the manager to intervene in the process should be selected. </blockquote><br>  The end of the quote. <br><br>  But I have not seen a specific set of indicators of MTP in any book. <br><br><h4>  2.7.  Time series </h4><br>  The time series of the indicator I is the set I (t) = {I (t1), I (t2), ....  I (tn)} of its values ‚Äã‚Äãat discrete time instants.  It is also called the dynamic series of indicator I. The time series can be considered as a statistical series.  Without knowing the internal background of obtaining the values ‚Äã‚Äãof a series, it can be considered as values ‚Äã‚Äãof a random variable, the distribution law of which is unknown. <br><br><h4>  2.8.  Indicator groups </h4><br>  Many indicators are heterogeneous.  Indicators are grouped.  Unification can be objective and subjective.  Subjective groups - grouping according to the local interests of the user.  Objective groups - grouping by economic criteria.  Examples of groups: balance, taxes, assets, securities, condition of the subject name, income ... Many groups can be considered as a graph in which the top is a group and the edges are types of relations between groups, for example, a group joining another group. <br><br><h3>  3. Product Structure Business Intelligence </h3><br><h4>  3.1.  ETL module </h4><br>  This is a module for extracting data from adjacent systems.  Data is transformed and stored in the data warehouse. <br><br><h4>  3.2.  Data store </h4><br>  This is a repository of time series of values ‚Äã‚Äãof indicators of both basic and derivatives. <br><br><h4>  3.3.  Interpreter </h4><br>  Its purpose is to calculate the value of a derived indicator based on the formula for calculating it. <br><br><h4>  3.4.  Performance machine </h4><br>  This is a generator of values ‚Äã‚Äãfor multiple indicators - a computational pool of indicators.  In the limit, these are all indicators.  So it‚Äôs easier to realize real time.  The indicators are interconnected and when calculating the values, the generator bypasses the graph of relations. <br><br><h4>  3.5.  Event monitor </h4><br>  The module monitors internal events, controlling the values ‚Äã‚Äãof logical indicators, the calculation formulas of which formalize the condition of the event.  External events are activated by external agents who, in the event of an event, notify the event monitor of this.  The monitor calls the event handler. <br><br><h4>  3.6.  Simulator </h4><br>  This is a program that allows you to answer the question ‚ÄúWhat happens if‚Äù.  ‚ÄúIf‚Äù is usually called a script.  Simulator is a script implementation apparatus.

The report can also be viewed on the screen. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some analytics systems view reports as the end result of analytics. I think this is not true. This is a semi-finished product. They usually look at the report, analyze something and select something from it and draw a conclusion. So is it not more correct to immediately formulate what you want to receive and implement it as a request.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course there are reports for external users. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is tax reporting, statistical ...

Cases from IT life </font></font></h3><br><h4>  6.1.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> This is not a drain tank. </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was a year in 2003. I work in the company STC Atlas. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I lead the development of the venture project Banking Analytics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One day the chef invites to an urgent meeting.</font></font> We are coming.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are introduced to new people (This, by the way, will be repeated several times. Business is business and many times it flashes up and the hope of meeting new interesting ideas fades). They are represented by doctors of technical (it seems) sciences. He says that his St. Petersburg company has developed an expert system as a semantic network and that he is ready to implement it in Belarus at the municipal, regional, republican levels. The network was displayed on the PC screen. The doctor spoke beautifully and convincingly. Energetic, assertive man. Well, all right, words of words ... Therefore, please read the documentation. Surprisingly, he gives us the terms of reference (TOR) for the system. We take a day to get to know each other and leave. I read TK. Fathers! What is not promised there: an accurate forecast of the exchange rate (by the way, this is an obsession with all scientists starting to try their hand at a practical economy), optimization of financial flows,improving the medical system, designing the President‚Äôs decision-making room (or below), etc. A lot more. It becomes clear to an experienced person what kind of system it is. But the man spoke so fascinatingly. I asked to see the knowledge database. They gave me a pretty dbf format database. There are dozens of three rules of the type in it: if a&gt; b then c = d + f. I ask if this is all. Yes, that‚Äôs all!? .. But we can also introduce new rules, if necessary?! .. So this is the main catch.But we can introduce new rules, if necessary?! .. So this is the main catch.But we can introduce new rules, if necessary?! .. So this is the main catch.</font></font><br><br>  Okay.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The next day we‚Äôre going again. Our chief engineer, an experienced developer, asked a couple of critical questions. I also. The answers were unintelligible. And all with links to Academician Pospelov (who created the so-called situational management), and that "this is not your drain tank." The chief engineer said out loud that all this dregs, rose and left. The doctor of sciences became enraged and said that the kritkans are old-timers and they don‚Äôt understand modern innovations. I, as an old man, got up and left as well. I will learn the next day that a group of young people has been formed under the Doctorate of Sciences (students and yesterday‚Äôs students) and that there will be almost an introduction in the Brest region. Okay, work. Under the doctor, a group was also created in St. Petersburg. Time passes. I ask youth how are you. It turns out that they are already occupied with another topic - Wi-Fi. ‚ÄúWhat about the semantic network?‚Äù They shrug in response.I have not seen more Petersburgers. Yes, indeed, automation is not your drain tank. I think that he nevertheless sawed off something on bread and butter.</font></font><br><br><h4>  6.2.      </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This case can be called ‚ÄúFormer physicists frolic.‚Äù The case occurred in Belarusbank. Sberbank (later it became Belarusbank) agreed with the company Namerek to develop a system of bank card payments. The case for those times is new and very relevant. Several stages were already well paid by the previous management of the bank. Now is the due date for the next stage. The executing company submitted a preliminary report and asks to pay for the current stage. And the leadership is now different. Sberbank has become a Belarusbank. And the new leadership wants to analyze the existing agreements. Is everything fulfilled there, are these contracts needed, etc. It is quite reasonable. The department of automation is asking to rate the work. After all, the topic concerns the introduction of an automated card settlement system. In the department, the assessment is entrusted to me.There are already several volumes of the ‚ÄúPreliminary Report‚Äù stage on this topic. I take the report (I still have it) I take the contract and begin to analyze. I open the report (sheets 300)) and see my familiar familiar formulas and equations. There is the Langevin equation from physics (something was considered as a random process and the apparatus of stochastic series was used) and many other equations. Continuous econophysics.</font></font> Amazing.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In roundabout ways I find out what kind of guys are in this company. Of course, former physicists. Quantums have come to the economy!</font></font> Good!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But you need to figure it out and it takes a lot of time. The problem is not only in formulas, but also in text sentences. I have not met such complex proposals and four-story titles before (I even wrote out some of them and tried to give my acquaintances for examination. The result is a stupor). Here is an example. The name of the contract topic: ‚ÄúStudy and development of new types of services, forms of income generation and methods of entering into broad market operations, development of a system for managing and regulating the economy of these services, development of a system of legal and regulatory and technical acts protecting the rights of people who accept payments when servicing clients Sberbank system BelCard. " This name has not been fixed in my memory. What does the part "..., the development of the management system ...", ".., development of the legal system ..." interfere with.Why accusative case? Maybe just "development ..."? Then at least the grammatical construction of the sentence becomes clear ... And further on like that.</font></font><br><br>  What to do?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I take the contract and start looking literally point by point for traces of their implementation in the report. The contract appears as the output of the program contract. Where are the programs? - No programs. There are no programs, but there are formulas (Langevin equation, Fokker-Planck equation ...). And this is only a preliminary report. I went through all the points and realized that the contract was not executed on any point and, apparently, could not be executed. Note that I am not saying anything about the importance of the formulas and the mathematical model itself. I am only talking about fulfilling the contract. But he is not executed. I invited the management to refuse payment and said that I was ready to motivate the court to refuse to pay (at least I gave this type of paper for signature to my direct management and I don‚Äôt know what happened next). And, of course, he cited the arguments of his point of view. And indicatedthat even the previous payment was upfront (in my opinion, about $ 100,000). But what has fallen is gone. And then, sorry ...</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What happened next, I don‚Äôt know. Soon I went to work at the BMRC (Belarusian Interbank Settlement Center). It turns out that immigrants from the former CC of the former Sberbank, and the current Belarusbank, worked there. We had a translator in our office, who often went abroad through the development of the Republic of Belarus payment system (RTGS), which was sponsored by Europe, and through which a lot of money flowed (but that's another matter). This translator brought gin and tonic from London and arranged a treat for some office workers. It was the beginning of perestroika, and for us, travel abroad, gin and tonic were new. I really enjoyed the drink. Jin was very fresh. We treated ourselves, relaxed, and began to talk about ... work, of course. And here I hear something interesting. We are talking about an agreement with Sberbank, to which the narrator (guest from outside) was involved before moving to the BMRC. It was supposedlygrandiose work, drawing, perhaps, to the Nobel Prize in economics. But then there were types in Belarusbank that hacked this project. I ask, and who hacked, specifically. And he looks at me and says: ‚ÄúWhy, you‚Äôve hacked it!‚Äù And it says on the face: ‚ÄúDo not pretend to be an innocent sheep.‚Äù I was taken aback. Then he remembered the ill-fated contract. It turns out that the contract, nevertheless, was hacked. (Then, working further, I realized that the same physicists want to attach the same topic to the BMRC. But this did not work either). The narrator himself was a very decent person. He approached everything in good faith and died of a heart attack at work. Rest in peace."And on the face it says:" Do not pretend to be an innocent sheep. " I was taken aback. Then he remembered the ill-fated contract.
