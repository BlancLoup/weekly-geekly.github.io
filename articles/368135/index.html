  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple lured away another Tesla engineer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The MacRumors edition drew <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/01/apple-automotive-team-new-hires/">attention</a> to a curious tendency: Apple hires engineers for the company, who are in one way or another connected with the automotive industry.  So recently Tesla left Hel Okersse (Hal Ockerse), who had worked for Ilona Mask since July last year, and was working on advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), such as engine control units, cameras, radar and other sensors. it‚Äôs not yet clear to be engaged in a new job - in his LinkedIn profile, simply stated ‚ÄúEngineering Team - Software at Apple‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There would be nothing surprising in the transition of an engineer to Apple if journalists had not noticed that there are a lot of people like him in the company.  Recently, Apple became an employee of Subhagato Dutta (Subhagato Dutta), previously worked in Texas Instrument.  His area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility included the development of visualization algorithms, while Dutta himself was previously engaged in research in the field of robotic vehicles.  His colleagues also included the recently hired Yakshu Madaan, a former operations manager of Tata Motors, which is the largest Indian automaker.  In addition, since February of this year, Apple has become a new place of work for former engineers of Tesla, Ford, General Motors, Crysler.  At least two of the hired specialists were engaged in one or another side of the development of robotic vehicles. <br><br>  Interestingly, it was in February that the first <a href="http://www.macdigger.ru/macall/luchshie-koncepty-avtomoblya-apple.html">rumors</a> arose about some secret Apple project called Project Titan.  As reported by the media, we are talking about creating an Apple car of its own original design, which is likely to be a robotic autonomous electric car.  The design phase of the project is still unknown, but furnished with Apple's inherent measure of secrecy.  So the Guardian <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/14/apple-self-driving-car-project-titan-sooner-than-expected">writes</a> that the project‚Äôs engineering team is working on a former naval base near San Francisco, which has been turned into a secret testing ground for robotic vehicles. <br><br>  True, there is another point of view, according to which Apple is unlikely to be engaged in the creation of a car, and most likely it is only about working on some operating system designed for installation in cars of other manufacturers.  However, this goes against Apple‚Äôs accepted practice of releasing its products and most authors want Apple to justify its reputation as a company capable of surprising and put something really revolutionary on the market. </div>
