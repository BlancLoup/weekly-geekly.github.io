      In this article I want to share the conclusions made in the process of observing the behavior of users.  In principle, everything has long been described in smart books, and without me and for someone, this will not be news, but someone can and will find something new and useful for themselves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Take the maximum </h2><br>  No matter how beautiful your prototypes are, no matter how ingenious the invented solutions are, and no matter how delicious the proposed coffee is, if the user closes, you will not get sensible results from it. <br><br>  Hence <b>the first conclusion:</b> show that you are on his side of the barricades.  Does he not like high prices on your site?  I completely agree, give a discount of 99.99%! <br><br>  He could not understand that the magnifying glass icon means a search?  I myself see it for the first time! <br><br>  Well, that sort of thing.  Agree, smile and understand that magic tune, thanks to which the user relaxes, and you get the maximum result. <br><br>  In the form of a bonus, he can also distribute a couple of good ideas that can be noted. <br><br><h2>  To know does not mean to do </h2><br>  Who is the owner of the iPhone knows that deletion is possible by swiping the desired file to the left.  However, when testing the application, users could not remove the product basket. <br><br>  They could not, because they were looking for an icon, a word, and any other thing that would clearly let them know that it could be removed like this.  Age and tenure of the iPhone did not matter.  They simply did not transfer their knowledge in managing the phone to the app. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> if the user understands the functions of the system does not mean that he will transfer these functions to the application.  Add icons and inscriptions that will help you understand how to perform this or that action. <br><br><h2>  We will not say - who, although it was a baby elephant </h2><br>  As you can endlessly look at the fire, and on the topic of captions to the icons you can talk endlessly. <br><br>  Once again, I am convinced that even the most zazyuzannye icons, which should have been a long time ago to grin the user's brain and develop an unconditioned reflex, they do not understand. <br><br>  <b>The conclusion is as</b> old as our planet: sign icons, make tooltips on the site and we will have a great and comprehensive happiness. <br><br><h2>  Freedom for parrots!  Svo-bo-doo-poo-ga-yam! </h2><br>  Search must be.  Clear field in a prominent place. <br><br>  Especially if the site is quite a lot of goods.  Small icons in the form of a magnifying glass, driven into the right corner of the site is fashionable and sometimes even cool.  But, as observations show, a sufficient number of visitors come with a ready-made solution and they need a search for a quick search.  Sorry for the tautology.  They will not find your search, they will go to competitors. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> Many products on the site?  Give us a noticeable search field! <br><br><h2>  You have your own fairy tale, and I have my own </h2><br>  Recommendations are good, even great.  We have individual recommendations that are displayed on the main page.  There is a separate page with recommendations on topics, events and many other good recommendations. <br><br>  But there is a problem: many people do not understand that the main page is individual recommendations, and a separate page is often ignored.  But notifications sent to the phone or mail with recommendations and updates draw much more user attention to themselves. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> it may not be worth spending too much space to show recommendations, and throw more energy into sending mailings and push notifications.  They perceive them as something more personal, and accordingly treat them with great interest.  Recommendations from friends, colleagues and acquaintances are also much appreciated. <br><br><h2>  - Where are you going?  - I do not know.  - Then we are on the way </h2><br>  Tell the user what is going to happen or is happening.  Without cheating.  To understand a few examples of life: <br>  - We will send the book to e-mail!  - Happily reports the site.  The user expects the book, and instead receives a link to download the application in which you can read this book. <br><br>  After buying a book on the site, the link proudly states: ‚ÄúYou can read the book in your application!‚Äù In fact, to read the application you need, also click on this link and see the inscription ‚ÄúSubmitted‚Äù.  But the user does not know this.  He, naive, long torments his application in search of the book sent. <br><br>  As a result of disappointment from unfulfilled hopes and minus in karma. <br><br><h2>  And we, you know, indulge in all the buns ... </h2><br>  Most sites tend to look fashionable, fresh and modern.  Screw a thousand fashionable chips, in the application to make gesture management to save space.  However, we should not forget that people who are far from the theme of ‚ÄúDesign Trends 2017‚Äù can be very hard to understand this.  The modern look of the site plays an important role when meeting, but convenience remained in the first place. <br><br>  Quite a decent piece of users choose certain resources in which they spend their time, not following the general trends of design development.  They transfer the gained user experience to other sites and applications. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion: the</b> wider the scope of your target audience, the more simple and clear the interface should be.  Otherwise, the chances of being misunderstood are increasing. <br><br><h2>  We start morning exercises for those who watch us in the evening </h2><br>  A little about the names of the categories.  I always thought that the categories of goods online stores should be as close as possible to the name of offline categories. <br>  Take the same books.  In any bookstore you will find psychology books, detectives, romance novels and more.  But it turned out that the user has his own head, the most convenient breakdown of products by category.  Sometimes such, which in my soul causes a lot of contradictions. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion: make</b> an open card sorting and maybe you will make for yourself a lot of interesting conclusions about the breakdown of products into categories and will find more loyal and appreciative users. <br><br><h2>  I asked for 400 drops ... And here 402 </h2><br>  In conclusion, I want to say a little about cases when testing.  The most relevant results can be obtained using case studies that are close to the user. <br><br>  As an example: A case for a young mother ‚ÄúChoose a book for yourself that you would like to read to a child‚Äù was performed with more interest than a similar case for a young, childless man. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> clearer conclusions and results can be obtained from tasks that users perform in real life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322574/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322574/</a></p>
