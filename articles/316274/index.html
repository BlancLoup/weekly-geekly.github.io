  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"The World is not the Wild West": IEEE has published a standard for creating benevolent robots</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to Martine Rothblatt, an entrepreneur and futurist, humanity is rapidly moving to the next evolutionary turn - by the time we start loading our minds into computers.  She notes that today, many people spend several hours a day chatting on social networks, sharing digital information that Martina calls "smart files." <br><br><blockquote>  "Large IT companies are pouring billions of dollars into the development of artificial intelligence, so there is a chance that these files will be used to create digital versions of people," <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/531251/qa-with-futurist-martine-rothblatt/">says</a> Rotblatt. </blockquote><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/vasexperts/blog/316274/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31b/816/973/31b816973dab4b5fbc3f09a551224864.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rutlo/">matthew rutledge</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a></i> <br><br>  For this reason, Martina deals with the personification, identity, and civil rights of future virtual people.  Will the digital version be you?  Or is it a completely different person?  And whether the person at all?

      And although we are definitely moving towards the moment of transfer of consciousness into the computer, a lot of time will pass before the first virtual people appear.  But there is already another, so to speak, category of objects (for the present), whose behavior should be regulated.  On December 13, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers - IEEE - <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/ec/autonomous_systems.html">presented the</a> first version of the "standard" for the creation of robots and artificial intelligence, which was called Ethically Aligned Design.  The document was developed with the participation of hundreds of members of the IEEE Global Initiative and <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/ec/ec_bios.pdf">experts</a> in the field of AI, ethics and other sciences. <br><br>  It is assumed that Ethically Aligned Design <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/ec/giecaias_guidelines.pdf">will</a> spur discussions in society about how intelligent and autonomous systems should behave in the value system and ethical principles of humanity.  Although artificial intelligence is a promising technology, it becomes obvious that more is needed than just computing power in order to solve ‚Äúdeep-seated‚Äù problems.  Therefore, the new standard warns developers against creating black boxes and offers methodologies for conducting research. <br><br>  IEEE notes that robots should not harm users.  The document states that intelligent systems are becoming more complex, because unprogrammed behavior can become dangerous, and supervision of the development of intelligent and autonomous systems is necessary. <br><br>  New and existing working groups will meet on this issue at the University of Texas at Austin from June 5‚Äì6, 2017 to make edits and take into account the wishes of the public in the second version of the document Ethically Aligned Design, which will be released in the fall of that year. <br><br><h2>  Robots in Russia </h2><br>  It is worth noting that similar questions are being asked in Russia.  For example, on December 15, Grishin Robotics founder and co-founder of Mail.ru Group, Dmitry Grishin, together with lawyer Viktor Naumov, <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/58524a9d9a7947d0061a78b0">presented the</a> draft law ‚ÄúOn Robotics‚Äù. <br><br>  The document proposes to partially apply to robots the same regulation that applies to animals and legal entities.  Today, as Grishin explains, artificial intelligence has no emotions, therefore it cannot become a subject of law - in this they resemble animals.  As for the legal entity, artificial intelligence is a "special legal design." <br><br>  Grishin allowed the creation of a unified register of robots of the type of the Unified State Register of Companies and the introduction of liability (including criminal) for manufacturers of robots as owners of a source of increased danger.  According to Grishin, robots may be subject to criminal law.  He notes four possible situations: the deliberate creation of a killer robot with the aim of committing an offense, the deliberate disabling of the robot's programs that block the infliction of harm to humans, and the deliberate and unintentional creation of a robot that can harm humans. <br><br>  The draft law was sent to the leading legal institutions, and the authors express the hope that it will become the basis for amending the Civil Code. <br><br>  Olga Uskova, president of Cognitive Technologies, is also confident that the issue of amending legislation has been raised very timely.  Her argument was that the autopilot industry is developing much faster than predicted (for example, in Pittsburgh, Uber has already begun testing drones on the streets of the city). <br><br>  She notes that it is necessary to introduce metrics and standards to establish the level of intelligence of robots, and work out the rules of behavior of machines with intelligence in critical situations. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIssues of a general philosophical nature and responsibility should also be addressed, but as part of the regulation.  First of all, it is necessary to develop a system of relations between machines, as well as between people and machines, ‚Äùcontinues Uskova. </blockquote><br>  Grishin is convinced that it is very important not to begin the regulation of this industry in Russia with the introduction of prohibitions.  Yes, robots are now less common in Russia than, for example, in the United States, but Russia has a chance to become the first in the field of robotics regulation, which will give huge advantages. <br><br>  What else do we write on the <a href="http://blog.vasexperts.ru/">VAS Experts</a> blog on Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/vasexperts/blog/316272/">"Echo of past years": How to solve the issue of lack of IPv4 addresses</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/vasexperts/blog/315006/">"Everywhere is online": the Internet on water, in the air and in space</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/vasexperts/blog/315008/">DPI-digest: Analyzing traffic, locks, platforms and manufacturers of DPI systems</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316274/</a></p>
