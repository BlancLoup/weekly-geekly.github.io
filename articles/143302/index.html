      It is a misconception that using broad match keywords in AdWords campaigns leads to uncontrollable spending and poor quality traffic.  However, with proper use, they can be the most successful words in a campaign.  Do your adwords campaigns need broad match keywords?  Here are three reasons why you should think about this: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Increase traffic</b> <br>  Obviously, the use of broad keywords leads to an increase in site traffic.  However, many have taken on faith that this is a wrong move and completely exclude them from the list of words, thus limiting the potential of their campaigns.  At the same time, chasing the best place in the ad unit to increase traffic, you spend time and money on raising bids on exact match keywords.  At some point, this strategy becomes more expensive than working with a broad-match list of words.  In addition, if your goal is to increase brand awareness and reach a wider audience, contextual announcements for broad-based requests are your excellent assistant, because this is the way to keep your name always in sight.  Remember, however, that words must be carefully chosen, otherwise the result may not meet expectations. <br><br>  <b>2. Search for new keywords</b> <br>  The use of broad-based keywords can be a valuable resource in the selection of new words for advertising campaigns, because they will lead visitors to a richer range of search queries in contrast to exact match words.  Do not forget to check the AdWords Search Queries report to always be aware of exactly which queries showed your ads.  These reports can spark great ideas for the "long tail" of keywords and variations of their writing.  These reports are good because they reveal all sorts of errors and typos that the search engine responded to.  Regularly looking through the mistakes and typographical errors of users in the Search Queries report, you will be able to identify various spellings of keywords for further integration into your contextual advertising campaigns.  Narrow match keywords can also make up the long tail of campaign queries, but they will be useless in identifying typos or errors. <br><br>  <b>3. Possible restrictions</b> <br>  Often when coordinating word lists for certain ad campaigns, advertisers miss the opportunity to set various kinds of restrictions during setup.  Despite the fact that the meaning of the word "restriction" often has a negative connotation, it can open in a very favorable light when it comes to the use of broad-match keywords.  One of the clever ways to control broad match keywords is to limit ad delivery by setting up so-called negative keywords ‚Äî something that every AdWords campaign should have.  Here you will again find the Google Search Queries report useful.  Above, I described how using reports you can find additional variations of keywords.  Similarly, you can match negative keywords, so that in response to user requests containing the selected words, your ads will not appear. <br><br>  Another keyword management tool is a broad match modifier.  It will provide wider coverage than phrase matching, without losing control over the display of ads.  If you are not familiar with this functionality, study it.  With standard settings, ads are shown if Google considers that a keyword is relevant to a user's request.  The modifier allows you to determine which word or words in the keyword phrase should be an obligatory part of the search query for which the ad is shown.  The modifier is easy to use - you just need to add the "+" sign in front of one or more keywords that you want to make part of the search query.  For example, if you have the keywords: "+ girls + under a dress + shoes," an ad may be shown for "shoes for girls under a dress" or "shoes for girls under a dress", but not for searching for "shoes for girls", since you set the modifier before the word "under the dress." <br><br>  Make sure that the keywords you use in your campaigns really match your goals and are effective in your advertising campaigns.  Broad match keywords can either work or not.  But if used correctly, they are correctly converted into new visitors to the site.  What matters is that!  We can not exclude any options without first trying how they can be used. <br><br>  <b><i>Comment by Elena Nosova, leading expert of the media planning department of iConText</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúThe article by Brittany will undoubtedly be interesting to beginner internet marketers.  The main idea that the author tries to convey is that when working with the context it is necessary to try all possible keywords, of course, subject to constant monitoring of the results.  Google offers many tools for tracking all stages of campaigns: from internal reports in AdWords to giant Google Analytics.  The broad match keyword management tools that the author is talking about can also be useful. <br><br>  Indeed, a good strategy for newbies can be the use of broad match keywords. <br><br>  By the way, I would like to note that for Google the question of the compliance of keywords with user queries is different than for ‚ÄúRussian-speaking‚Äù search engines: for example, in Russian there is no fundamental importance of the order of words in a search query.  It should be noted that the keyword is not equal to the search query, that is, the ad can be shown on a wider range of queries than specified in the keyword settings. <br><br>  It‚Äôs also worth saying that both Yandex and Runner offer their keyword selection tools.  And, for example, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnegative words is implemented by Yandex more elegantly than on Google: for each word, you can set an individual set of negative words. <br>  Do not underestimate the statistics of Yandex search queries and the Google report mentioned in the article, because this is the language of your audience. <br>  This article is another proof of simple truth - the variety of advertising campaign settings tends to infinity, but only experience will show which ones are right for you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143302/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143302/</a></p>
