A number of factors associated with the latest search engine developments in facilitating the search for certain queries also contribute to this trend, as well as the active and large-scale marketing company of the largest search engine around the globe. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Consumer behavior changes daily and rather rapidly.  And even the most talented digital marketers are finding it harder to predict.  For many, smartphones play the role of the first and last thing used by the philistine in their daily lives.  Mobile devices in the modern world help to look from the inside at the average consumer, his friends, followers, as well as their daily habits. <br>  Here are a few reasons why every dollar spent on mobile advertising gains its unique value in the rapidly developing world of Internet technology.

      <b>The greatest strengths of mobile search</b> <br><br>  Based on data from <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/">SmartInsights</a> , <a href="">80% of</a> Internet users are looking for information on the means of smartphones.  This figure is becoming more convincing, given that <a href="">48% of</a> consumers use search as the most frequent form for mobile surfing. <br>  Paid search is increasingly becoming a field where the entire focus of attention is focused on maximizing the value of keywords.  The evolution of search behavior in relation to the cross-platform use of devices means that marketing strategies in relation to the field of mobile should be considered not only as important, but also <i>essential</i> for implementation. <br><br>  Try to start with independent research. <br>  Take your smartphone.  Think about the user's intentions and start optimizing existing resources. <br>  A number of simple questions will help you get closer to the thinking of the average person in the mobile space.  We give them further. <br>  So, think, is it easy to read content on the mobile version of your site?  Is the design intuitive, the most accessible to use?  If visitors are looking for your contacts or address, is it easy for them to go to the appropriate page?  If they are looking for a phone number, there must be an active feedback button for ease of making calls.  These and many other simple details that lead your user to a relevant request will help build a certain trust not only in the site itself, but also in arranging it for purchase, which will naturally help you to stand out among competitors. <br><br>  This means that the global role is currently assigned to optimize websites and search ads for mobile devices.  With updates to algorithms such as Pigeon, as well as <a href="http://blog.zogdigital.com/2015/03/26/websites-lacking-mobile-optimization-responsive-design-will-lose-search-visibility-google-confirms/">Mobilegeddon</a> , Google will pay more attention to local search on mobile, so every position is important. <br><br>  <b>Growing mobile ad space</b> <br><br>  <i>From now on, marketers are diligently concentrating on increasing the budget line in the field of mobile advertising.</i> <br>  According to the latest observations in 2015, the cost of mobile ads is growing rapidly, reaching 50%, which in monetary terms amounted to $ 28,720 billion.  It is known that this is almost 49% of the budget of all total advertising expenses in the digital sphere, based on information obtained from eMarketer reports. <br><br>  <b>The trend of the influence of devices on society</b> <br><br>  According to <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/so-many-apps-so-much-more-time-for-entertainment.html">Nielson</a> , there was a 63 percent increase in user residence time in mobile applications.  This is almost 37 hours and 28 minutes per month when a person uses the application. <br>  At the moment, social networks are not only a means for active communications, but also applications where brands get the most recognition.  According to <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2015/07/14/the-evolving-role-of-news-on-twitter-and-facebook/">Pew</a> , the percentage of users who use Twitter and Facebook to publish and share news continues to grow monthly.  This is not surprising, since most people, using Twitter, try to keep us up to date with events and news: both official and personal.  A large number of users create accounts in social networks to be in trend communication, and this is probably also a great way to attract new users. <br><br>  Social networks are constantly changing, and recently many large platforms are looking for new ways to engage mobile users.  This includes various tricky posts in news feeds that draw attention to the retail application itself and the constant trend change in content marketing.  By the end of 2014, mobile video covered about 55% of data use according to <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/white_paper_c11-520862.html">Cisco's 2015</a> mobile forecast. <br><br>  This gives an affirmative signal to focus on mobile content, as well as its ability to manage ROI for brands.  Marketers should actively use these new trends and available data, or take into account the huge risk of losing potential income. <br><br>  <b>Information is available more than ever.</b> <br><br>  Analytics of the behavior of the device search principle can be hard, but we always have the tools at our disposal for such purposes. <br>  In 2014, more than half (62.5%) of search engine users also searched on their mobile phones.  <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Future-of-Cross-Device-Search-Better-Targeting/1012337">eMarketer</a> predicts a rapid increase in this number by more than 90% over the next five years. <br>  <i>Every dollar invested in your mobile device is becoming more and more valuable.</i> <br><br>  More contextual information is transmitted along with each click, swipe and scroll.  Now, more than ever, customers are using the Internet for their offline solutions, seamlessly integrating digital influence into the world of real solutions.  For the consumer in 2015, the use of mobile devices must be closely related to everyday life in order to easily make purchases or sales. <br><br>  Last year, Google introduced store-visiting analytics, which helps retailers track users who go to the store through ad searches. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://www.ninthdecimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ND_Insights_SpecialReport.pdf">NinthDecimal</a> research, shopping has increased by 80 percent during the first day since the publication of the mobile ad compared to average store visits. <br><br>  <b>Market Growth and Millennials</b> <br><br>  Buyers between the ages of 18 and 34 make up more than half of those who use the Internet to shop and spend money online. <br>  Now it is about 79 million Millennials in the United States compared to the 48 million in generation X. Their large volume and purchasing power will not only dictate, but also predetermine the development trends of e-commerce and mobile marketing in general. <br>  It is no secret that almost half of the Millennials made purchases through the telephone, and this number continues to grow. <br>  According to <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2010/10/millennials-confident-connected-open-to-change.pdf">PewSocialTrends</a> , 41% of the Millennials identified their smartphones as the relevant communication format.  More and more consumers often use search engines to scout and make a choice: to make a purchase in a store or on the Internet. <br><br>  Their daily habits should predetermine further trends in the development of mobile marketing in order to remain <b>as relevant as possible to user needs and requirements.</b>  Millennials and many other users of any age have enough tools at their disposal to make their purchasing decisions. <br>  This suggests an obvious conclusion about the need for active use of these tools by web marketers, as well as business owners and companies directly interested in increasing their sales. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295724/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295724/</a></p>
