What can then be said about newbies who are striving to master the “advanced” techniques as soon as possible with complete confidence that this will make them real marketing gurus and pros.  As it turned out, in order to remember the basic things and not to run forward without preparing the necessary foundation, it suffices to recall some phrases that each of us heard in childhood.  Do not take this article too seriously, but remember that in every joke there is some truth. <br><br>  In principle, each of these lessons is universal and applicable in any situation, but we have tried to adapt them to the field of Internet marketing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  1. "Are you going to wear <b>this</b> ?" </h5><br>  What did she mean: “Do you really think this is appropriate?” <br><br>  Lesson for marketers: The appearance of the resource is the first and sometimes the main factor influencing your visitor.  You can’t tolerate carelessness in the design of your page;  all the details, each decision should pursue a specific goal and comply with the general concept of the site.  In any case, everything should look professional, even if it is a template page.  In the end, use the site builder.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

    <h5>  2. "You will ape - and you will remain so" </h5><br>  What did she mean: “Stop doing something wrong before it becomes a habit” <br><br>  Lesson for marketers: Bad habits are easily formed and take a long time to go.  You may have a set of tricks that you consider “your style”.  These may be original revolutions in the text, unexpected visual solutions or specific content of the site, but how confident are you that these techniques are effective and do not have a negative result?  Do not forget about feedback, try to get an objective assessment of each of your "habits" and get rid of harmful as soon as possible. <br><br><h5>  3. "Where did you get this?"  I didn’t teach you that. ” </h5><br>  What did she mean: “Your actions do not always correspond to your upbringing (knowledge) and generally accepted norms” <br><br>  Lesson for marketers: Your content must fully comply with the idea of ​​your brand.  Of course, you can apply various techniques and tactics, but at the same time they must harmoniously interact and constitute a single marketing strategy, the task of which is to create a sustainable image of a brand, product or idea.  You must comply with the values ​​that you profess, otherwise you will be mistaken ... <br><br><h5>  4. "Sit quietly!" </h5><br>  What she had in mind: "If you constantly rush from side to side - nothing good will work" <br><br>  Lesson for marketers: Identify your target audience and hit right on target.  If you start writing articles for fifteen-year-old girls, and then abruptly go over articles on caring for a beard, you will encounter at least a slight misunderstanding on the part of regular readers and are unlikely to find new readers who will not appreciate even the most useful information about the beard on pink pony background. <br><br><h5>  5. “Take care of something.” </h5><br>  What she meant was: “Do not complain of boredom.  There is always something that needs to be done. ” <br><br>  Lesson for marketers: Even when it seems to you that everything has already been done, there is always <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/paysto/blog/219179/">something</a> that you have not paid due attention to. <br><br><h5>  6. "Just wait, father will come back ..." </h5><br>  What she meant: “Every act has its consequences” <br><br>  Lesson for marketers: If you or your team made a serious blunder, you should often say this openly, apologize and try to compensate for the inconvenience, rather than trying to hide things that sooner or later come to the surface and hit you with double force. <br><br>  Support service was slow to answer?  Connect online consultant.  Wrong item came?  Apologize publicly and present a discount coupon.  Turn your blunders into something that will be remembered with a smile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/186/076/d42/186076d425540b71e447d91714516c5c.jpg" align="right" alt="image"><br><h5>  7. "And if everyone goes to jump from the roof, will you go too?" </h5><br>  What did she mean: "Think with your head" <br><br>  A lesson for marketers: Trends in marketing come and go, but you shouldn’t do something just because it's “accepted”.  Be selective and inventive, evaluate each planned innovation in terms of its effectiveness for your field of activity.  Do not try to keep up with fashion, do what is really necessary for the success of your company. <br><br><h5>  8. “Because I said so” </h5><br>  What she had in mind: “Sometimes your opinion doesn’t matter” <br><br>  Lesson for marketers: You will not always get good reviews.  Sometimes you will be sent to provoke, you can not convince everyone.  If this is really important, you should either change the strategy or change the target audience, but more often it’s enough just not to feed the trolls. <br><br><h5>  9. "How to talk to the wall" </h5><br>  What did she mean: "Be more open, nobody knows what you are thinking about" <br><br>  Lesson for marketers: the Internet provides ample opportunity to establish and maintain communication with your customers.  Create a sense of conversation, tell them about yourself, show yourself, make your messages individual.  Use photos, tell stories and carefully read the comments.  Only in this way can you achieve trust and supportive attitude. <br><br><h5>  10. “I told you a hundred times” </h5><br>  What she had in mind: "Information should be perceived immediately" <br><br>  Lesson for marketers: You have two or three seconds to get attention.  If your headline does not attract the attention of readers, then the next 2000 words will not be read by anyone.  The slogan should be clear and simple, easy to remember and spin on the language.  If you fail the “first contact”, you will not have a chance to repeat what you wanted to say. <br><br><h5>  11. “Someday you will say“ thank you ”to me!” </h5><br>  What did she mean: “Your gratitude is worth a lot” <br><br>  Lesson for marketers: We all love to thank us.  When was the last time you said “thank you” to your customers?  Just like that, without any reason.  You can achieve incredible results simply by thanking your customers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220855/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220855/</a></p>
