      Professional workstations are designed to run demanding applications and place high demands on system performance and reliability.  Designers and designers using workstations perform responsible tasks and must clearly meet the deadlines, and the inefficient operation of equipment and its breakdown may affect the business processes of a manufacturing enterprise. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b9/a6a/288/0b9a6a2888c956c6e2db7a448e24d3ef.jpg"></div><br>  So, the tasks of computer-aided design require high performance to work with complex layouts, so they use professional-level processors and graphics cards.  This allows, for example, a design engineer to quickly analyze the results of each phase of a project, promptly make changes and run the next iteration. <br>  How to achieve maximum performance from the workstation, stable and efficient work?  For this there are special solutions.  About one of them will be discussed. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Workstation Optimizer</font> </h2><br>  By automatically setting up the system, <a href="http://www.dell.com/optimizer">Dell Precision Optimizer</a> (DPO) software can improve the performance of applications running on Dell workstations by 121%. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c12/242/05b/c1224205b75f5a770e7aff2d1423d1df.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Dell Precision Optimizer software differentiates Dell workstations from competitive offerings.</font></i> <br><br>  It is installed free of charge on all new <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/precision-desktops%3Fref%3D255_franchise">Dell Precision</a> workstations and supports popular third-party software vendors such as Adobe After Effects, Illustrator, and Photoshop;  Autodesk AutoCAD, Inventor and Maya;  Dassault SolidWorks and CATIA;  Siemens NX;  Schlumberger Petrel;  ANSYS Fluent and Workbench, and also provides for the centralized management of multiple workstations over the network using SCCM and KACE.

However, there is no support for other vendor workstations: the Dell Precision Optimizer operates exclusively on Precision workstations.  Other vendors offer their own solutions. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Examples of using</font> </h2><br>  Test results are supported by real-world examples of using the Dell Precision Optimizer.  One of the customers, the company KNAPP (Austria), specializes in customer service and owns a network of automated warehouses.  KNAPP specialists prepare their presentations at workstations, and then demonstrate them to clients on tablets.  Along with mobility, KNAPP attaches great importance to the performance and manageability of software products, such as AutoCAD, Vectorworks and PTC Creo. <br><br>  The company's management wants designers to use applications ‚Äúto the maximum‚Äù and not spend hours of their working hours, optimizing productivity manually and - most importantly - trying to understand how this is done.  About 500 Dell Precision 15 Series 7000 workstations are deployed at KNAPP headquarters, another 400 are used at the company's branches. <br><br>  To optimize their performance, KNAPP decided to use the Dell Precision Optimizer software.  Now it provides detailed statistics to eliminate bottlenecks and speeds up the work of applications.  For example, when working with AutoCAD or PTC Creo, system settings change dynamically.  Company IT professionals can centrally apply Dell Precision Optimizer policies using Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) and receive analytical reports from remote workstations, as well as update software. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ac/d87/3ca/0acd873cade75cb25e3943870edceec5.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">For mobile workers, KNAPP has chosen the Dell Precision 15 7000 Series Compact Workstations.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">They are equipped with displays with a resolution of 4K, Intel Core and Xeon processors of the sixth generation, professional graphics cards from AMD or NVIDIA with 4 GB of memory.</font></i> <br><br>  After introducing Dell Precision Optimizer into KNAPP, the performance of all workstations, including older models, increased by an average of 20%.  Increased customer satisfaction, employees began to work more productively.  According to KNAPP estimates, overall performance has increased by 5‚Äì10%.  And the performance of key applications in the company increased by 100%. <br><br>  Another example is the Japanese company Mikuni, which using the Dell Precision Optimizer increased the performance of its SolidWorks software by 20%.  Mikuni also notes that new Dell workstations are 40% smaller than those used in the company earlier, and this saves space in the workplace. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b17/e27/54b/b17e2754bad0c3ed1fd6703afdf05a52.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Mikuni designs automotive engines and uses Dell Precision Tower 3420 workstations with NVIDIA Quadro K1200 graphics cards and ProSupport Client Suite support.</font></i> <br><br>  Professionals whose work is related to video processing have always needed powerful tools and enhanced performance.  Dell Precision Optimizer gives a huge advantage to users, as it contributes to the implementation of projects in a shorter time and helps to realize the creative potential of employees. <br><br>  Dell Precision Optimizer is one of the promising innovative tools.  Convenient to use, it helps customers achieve high performance and reliability.  Thanks to this product, users working at Dell Precision stations can create better content and implement projects in less time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403065/</a></p>
