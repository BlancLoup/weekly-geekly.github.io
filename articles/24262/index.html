The old head coach, passing the case, warned his successor that in the safe he leaves three envelopes numbered: number 1, number 2 and number 3. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚Äú <i>If you have problems, then open them one by one</i> ,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  New coach started to work.  The first season ended and the team showed very poor results.  Coach called on the carpet.  Remembering the advice of his predecessor, he opened the safe, opened the envelope number 1. It was written: " <i>Vali all on me</i> ."  So he did.  The club management gave him the opportunity to improve the situation.

      Another season passes.  The team plays even worse.  The coach is called back to the carpet.  The one to the safe.  Opens envelope number 2, reads: " <i>Take all the blame on yourself</i> ."  The coach at a meeting with the leadership of the club is doing so: " <i>Yes, I am guilty, I failed, I made mistakes, I looked around somewhere, I got excited a little</i> ".  And the club gives him another chance to correct the situation. <br><br>  The third season and the team flies out of the league in which she played.  Angry management causes the coach again.  He hurries to the safe and opens the last envelope.  And it says: " <i>Prepare three envelopes</i> ." <br><br>  - The story is reprinted in a rumor from Igor Mann's audiobook Marketing. <br>  He himself heard her from his father. <br><br>  A little more text from that chapter: <br>  - Learn from the mistakes of their own and others.  Be prepared that more often you will have to learn from your mistakes.  First, few people admit to their mistakes and share them.  Secondly, as a rule, to learn a lesson, you have to step on the rake yourself.  But be careful, the management does not like employees who repeat the same mistakes. <br><br>  Everybody can make a mistake once.  The second time is also forgivable.  Anyone who makes no mistakes does nothing at all.  But repeating a mistake a third time is a sign that you are not learning.  Make mistakes, learn from them, but do not repeat them three times. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIf you have learned from a mistake, then do not consider this mistake to be a mistake‚Äù, - Vince Lombardi.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24262/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24262/</a></p>
