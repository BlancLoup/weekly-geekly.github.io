Leads the classic ways to solve these problems in the OOP style, pointing out the pros and cons of each approach.  After that, detailed examples of solving typical tasks (logging and caching) by refactoring the code in the aspect style using the <a href="https://github.com/lisachenko/go-aop-php">Go!</a> Library are given <a href="https://github.com/lisachenko/go-aop-php">.</a>  <a href="https://github.com/lisachenko/go-aop-php">Aop</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://jonathonhill.net/2012-12-19/video-multi-tasking-in-php/">PHP Multitasking</a> - Videotape of a great presentation that uncovers the topic of multitasking in PHP for solving common problems, such as batch processing of data or the creation of demons.

A similar review was made by the author of the post, besides the events highlighting also the directions of development that became apparent during the year.  The author also makes assumptions concerning the current 2013 already, predicting improvements in the DiC area and more active use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a> with the help of <a href="http://www.phpspec.net/">PHPSpec</a> and Behat.

The latter interested the author more than others, and he described in more detail the process of registering, creating and configuring the application on it. </li></ul><br><h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a93/d41/07f/a93d4107f28f667a4c3336347ef78774.png">  Study materials </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://searchco.de/blog/view/code-for-a-search-engine-in-php-part-1/">Create a search engine for PHP</a> - A good post in 5 parts about creating your own search engine in pure PHP.

In the post, the author talks about personal captcha recognition experience in PHP. </li><li>  <a href="http://phpmaster.com/whats-new-in-laravel-4/">What's New in Laravel 4</a> - The question of when version 4 will be released is probably one of the most frequently asked questions about Laravel.  And, unfortunately, there is no concrete answer at the moment - it will be released when it is ready.  In its current form, the stage in which the framework is located can be described as something between pre-beta and beta.  But you can <a href="https://github.com/illuminate/app">feel the</a> upcoming release now.  And in the post the author talks about some of the new features and improvements Laravel 4. </li><li>  <a href="http://philsturgeon.co.uk/blog/2012/12/why-do-some-php-devs-love-static">Why do some PHP developers like static APIs?</a>  - There are 10 types of developers: those who are madly in love with static methods, because they are easy to use, and those who believe that the devil himself has invented them in order to experience devotion to proper programming.  In the article, the author shares his experience and explains why some developers ignore best practices and use too many static methods. </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2013/01/dependency-injection-programming-with.html">Programming with Anthony - Dependency Injection</a> - Continuation of a series of training videos from maestro Anthony Ferrara.

And if you are still working on the implementation of the details and find out whether you can get the desired result, then perhaps there is no need to test yet, which, however, is obvious. </li><li>  <a href="http://akrabat.com/zend-framework-2/thoughts-on-module-directory-structure/">Thoughts on the directory structure</a> - In his article, the author says that the standard directory structure in ZF2, which can be seen everywhere, is just a recommendation.

The author gives an example and recommendations for changing the directory structure. </li><li>  <a href="http://nitschinger.at/Caching-Doctrine-Entities-with-Couchbase">Caching Doctrine Entities with Couchbase</a> - Detailed tutorial in which the author actually shows how to use Couchbase as a cache for Doctrine entities. </li><li>  <a href="http://gonzalo123.com/2013/01/07/handling-several-pdo-database-connections-in-symfony2-through-the-dependency-injection-container-with-php/">We use several PDO connections to the base in Symfony2 via DIC</a> - ‚ÄúA small note in which the author first demonstrates the familiar way of configuring several connections to the base in the‚Äú parameters.yml ‚Äùfile.  After that, the author demonstrates a more advanced approach, configuring the connections in a separate file and creating the Db class, which allows you to receive fully configured and ready-to-use PDO objects from the container. </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/software-quality/bid/256072/13-reasons-your-open-source-docs-make-people-want-to-scream">13 things that users hate in the documentation of your open source project</a> - Almost every programmer has a code that he would like to share or already share with the community.  However, how much this code will be useful to other developers depends largely on the quality of the documentation.  The article contains errors that are most often made by developers when documenting their own works. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.eschrade.com/page/why-is-fastcgi-w-nginx-so-much-faster-than-apache-w-mod_php/">Why is FastCGI with Nginx so much faster than Apache with mod_php?</a>  - In his post, the author does several tests on the ‚Äûhello world‚Äú application and tries to understand why Nginx is faster than Apache.  His research showed that Apache deals with processing .htaccess files a significant impact on performance, and disabling it (AllowOverride None) changes the situation and Apache overtakes Nginx. </li><li>  <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/build-a-twitter-clone-from-scratch-the-design/">Clone Twitter for PHP</a> , <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/building-ribbit-in-php/">2</a> - A pair of tutorials that detail how to create a full-fledged Twitter clone from scratch.  <a href="http://ribbitphp.pagodabox.com/">Demo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NETTUTS/Ribbit-PHP">full code are</a> also available. </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165013/">It was evening, echo "there was nothing"</a> - In <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/zfort/blog/164295/">previous</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/zfort/blog/162661/">releases of the</a> digest, there were links to experiments in which the authors write a PHP script without using numeric and alphabetic characters.
