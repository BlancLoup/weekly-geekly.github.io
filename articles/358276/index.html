      Now the Veeam Academy is taking a spring course, which started on March 14 of this year, the graduation is scheduled for the end of May.  The guys have difficult stages of selection, which included online testing and face-to-face interviews with employees of the Research and Development department. <br><br>  More than 400 applications were received for online testing.  According to its results, we invited 50 most successful candidates to a personal interview at the office.  After the face-to-face interview, 11 people remained, of whom the group was formed.  The students of the course were students who scored a high score on testing, who had basic knowledge of C # programming and were ready to gain practical team development skills. <br><br>  Leading teacher of the course - Dmitry Shalymov, Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematics, MCSD, has experience in commercial software development for more than 10 years and teaching experience of more than 5 years, co-author of more than 40 scientific publications. <br><br>  During training, not only lectures take place, but also seminars and master classes with the participation of leading developers of the Veeam Software group of companies, who share their experience and knowledge and acquaint children with the peculiarities of team development using the Scrum methodology. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Shelyomin</b> , leading developer of the Veeam Software group of companies: <i>‚ÄúI undertook to talk about databases and tried to breathe some fresh air into this topic, which many people find boring and academic (I don‚Äôt think so :)).</i>  <i>We discussed a variety of topics, ranging from the advantages and disadvantages of different database architectures to the Entity Framework, and talked about performance, indexes, and transactions.</i>  <i>It was very nice to see the enthusiasm of the guys who actively asked questions and participated in discussions. "</i> <br><br>  In addition to team development, the guys are working on an individual project, where they get acquainted with Microsoft .NET technologies.  Each student has a mentor to whom you can contact with questions or get recommendations, for example, on the implementation of laboratory work. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Shalymov</b> , teacher: <i>‚ÄúInitially, we did not know what level the participants would go to Veeam Academy.</i>  <i>Therefore, in drawing up the program, they were largely guided by the fact that it would be interesting to listen to both novice programmers and children with experience.</i>  <i>We have included quite a lot of Microsoft technologies in the course so that we can get to know them in practice.</i>  <i>Of course, we understood that the course duration does not allow mastering them at a serious level.</i>  <i>However, the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthese technologies was developed by each of the participants, and pretty soon it became clear who is more interested in what. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/us/ss/wi/ussswi02lr-2welylyr0xxv1fle.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The course is quite intensive: 2-3 lectures take place every week.  But the rest of the time, the guys stay in touch with the team and the teacher, discussing pressing issues in instant messengers and social networks. <br><br>  Project protection at Veeam Academy is scheduled for late May.  According to its results, students will receive a state certificate on the passage of a training course in C #.  Of course, not without a graduation party.  But the most important thing is that after graduation, our graduates will get a real chance to get a job in the Research and Development department of the Veeam Software group of companies. <br><br>  If you live in St. Petersburg, then you also have the opportunity to get into Veeam Academy on an intensive programming in C #. <br><br>  Register <a href="https://academy.veeam.ru/"><b>on the site</b></a> and join !!! <br><br>  Follow the news in our <a href="https://vk.com/veeamacademy">group in VKontakte</a> <br><br>  If you have any questions, you can ask them in the comments to this post or send an e-mail to: academy@veeam.com </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358276/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358276/</a></p>
