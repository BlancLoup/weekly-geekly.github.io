We are delighted when we see services and services appear, which it was impossible to even think about three or five or ten years ago. <br><br>  At the end of 2010, we gathered around the idea to do this everyday change: to make a real service for taxi passengers, to give people the opportunity to order a taxi without unnecessary movements, quickly and comfortably, and be confident in the quality of services provided.

      On Habr√© already there were several articles from our friends and our competitors.  Everyone has their own view of the problems, their own proposals for solving them, a bit of their own business. <br><br>  We will try to tell you about our approach, not giving in to the desire to compare with the ideas of our colleagues. <br><br>  This is the story of our project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c5/c3d/435/3c5c3d435e2bff9ade5b35dfc8e406da.png" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Russian taxi.  Private traders and taxi companies. </h4><br>  Taxi problems in Russia (although in the first place, I speak, of course, about Moscow) are so well known, perhaps, to everyone, that they can be simply listed without going into argument. <br><ul><li>  The feed rate of the machine and the guarantee that it will generally be filed. </li><li>  Comfort and safety of the car, the adequacy of the driver. </li><li>  Difficult and often expensive fares. </li><li>  Already not always, but often a low level of automation and comfort in providing services: it happens that you have to hang on your phone for more than 10 minutes until you can finally place an order. </li></ul><br>  Our product, as we decided, should, first of all, strive to solve these problems through technology.  We have to automate everything that can be automated.  Protect the passenger where he can be protected.  Save all participants in the process from unnecessary actions.  But the main thing - to transfer control into the hands of the passenger.  To provide him with all the information, to give him a choice, to serve him in time in the process of transportation. <br><br>  Perhaps the first dilemma that has arisen is with whom to work, who will carry passengers.  The inner idealist told us: ‚ÄúWe need to reduce drivers and passengers.  Now is the age of social networks, peer-to-peer technologies, total mobilization and continuous barter.  Hooray!".  Distribute to each driver and passenger according to the application and withdraw. <br><br>  Unfortunately, idealism does not work.  The passenger service itself is so nontrivial that there are special organizations, most of whose activities are reduced to the management of taxi drivers, drivers, cars.  Problems of quality control, safety, comfort, logistics, tariffs, mutual settlements, all these organizations assume.  The name of them - taxis. <br><br>  When we realized that, firstly, we didn‚Äôt want to do this, and secondly, that there are already people who can do it perfectly, we decided: let the taxi stations take up transportation, and we will deal with passengers.  We will look for them, help them make a choice, it is convenient to report on the process of order execution.  We will control taxis in terms of quality of service.  We will develop a competitive environment, thus reducing the cost of travel.  And most importantly, we will form a social environment in which taxi stations and passengers will be able to influence each other. <br><br>  We work with legal carriers, and we focus on taxi companies that manage their fleet: they monitor the cleanliness of cars and the quality of drivers, and take responsibility for passengers. <br><br><h4>  inTaxi - our service and our products </h4><br>  The inTaxi system works as follows: <br><ol><li>  The passenger places an order: indicates where and where he wants to go, what requirements and wishes he has and when he would like to do it. </li><li>  The order appears in the systems of taxis </li><li>  Taxis, interested in the implementation of this order make their proposals: indicate the tariff (or a fixed price) and the time in which they can submit the car. </li><li>  The passenger for a limited period of time (now it is 5 minutes), examines the received offers and selects the one he likes most.  This taxi company becomes the full owner of the order. </li><li>  At a certain point in time, a taxi company assigns a specific vehicle to fulfill an order.  The passenger receives information about his model and color, license plate, telephone number and driver's name (for special cases). </li><li>  When the car arrives at the starting point, the passenger is notified of this.  We also remind him of the free time limit. </li><li>  Upon completion of the trip, the passenger is informed of the exact cost of the trip. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/25ad911a/768223ea/99d48ca7/ec02b8fb.png" alt="image" align="right"><br><br>  About two weeks ago we launched our <a href="http://intaxi.ru/itunes">iPhone app</a> .  It is expectedly called inTaxi and allows you to: Ôøº <br><ul><li>  order a taxi in Moscow and St. Petersburg </li><li>  see the proposed route, its forecast and current traffic situation </li><li>  see a detailed description of the tariffs taxis </li><li>  make a choice from the proposals of several taxi companies </li><li>  receive immediate alerts on order status changes </li><li>  read and write reviews </li><li>  upon arrival to the target receive in the application the final order value </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://intaxi.ru/iphone/">On our site</a> you can see a more detailed description of the application with screenshots. <br><br>  In addition, the order can be made on the website <a href="http://intaxi.ru/">intaxi.ru</a> .  When ordering from the site notifications about the status of its implementation will be sent to you by SMS. <br><br>  Anticipating questions, the android version of the application will be released at the end of August, which we will additionally tell about.  Launches in other cities (and even countries) are not far off, but we will be very happy to offer cooperation in this context. <br><br><h4>  State of the company </h4><br>  Our application is in the top free applications in the AppStore (now - 12th place), in the coming weeks it will be very aggressively developed and updated.  The number of installations is approaching 10 thousand and the rate of their growth does not decrease yet. <br><br>  We are planning to release an Android version of the inTaxi application, an intriguing way to go offline in Moscow, launch in several new cities, and optimize the quality of the services we provide. <br><br>  We have experience in launching successful projects, and now we are developing not only inTaxi.  We hire employees, we are very looking for Python-programmers and front-end vendors for excellent conditions and interesting tasks.  We invite to cooperation all who can be interesting: portals and services related to transport, taxi stations, hotels and restaurants, customers. <br><br>  It will be very interesting and useful for us to hear opinions and advice from Habrahabr readers, both from the passenger side and from the point of view of experts of the IT world.  We will be grateful for this! <br><br>  In our future articles, we will tell you about what is happening in the technological world with traditional services such as taxis, how they are automated, what is being introduced.  We will touch on our experience in building systems and our development processes. <br><br>  See you later! <br><br>  <a href="http://intaxi.ru/itunes">App in the AppStore</a> |  <a href="http://twitter.com/intaxiru">Our twitter</a> |  <a href="http://facebook.com/intaxi/">Our facebook page</a> <br><br>  PS Watch our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DAc01J8gyT60">promo video</a> , it's good!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126116/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126116/</a></p>
