      We must promote our work;  as people from literature and art, for example, resort to agency services and management.  Visibility, visibility - vital for the flow of proposals, promotions and prospects, says Jeffrey Pfeffer, Professor Standford's Graduate School of Business. <br><br>  In his book <i>Power: Why Some People, the</i> study confirms that <b>there is no</b> direct link between performance and output.  The work experience at the current place, the prospects for advancement and the results of countless performance evaluations - all this means much less than we imagine.  Unfair, and even annoying - our image is the reality of work. <br><br>  Do not hope that everyone around you will learn about the cool things you are doing.  This is the irony: we are afraid of self-advertisement, they say, the things that stand should speak for themselves, but in fact this is false modesty, even with elements of pride.  Everyone is on his own mind.  This is about us and about everyone else.  That is, everyone is immersed in their own affairs, thoughts and lives. <br><br>  That is why people, including the bosses, have a very vague idea about us, if we do not specifically tell them anything.  We are simply imperceptible while we are reclusive and work hard.  Making yourself noticeable for proposals is also part of the work, and not least important. <br><br>  Imagine again: no one <b>really</b> knows what you are working on.  To be visible to the "radar", you need to send a clear signal. <br><br><h3>  Second half </h3><br>  Even the most intelligent and beautiful need to some extent be in the "common pen" and act with the team.  Of course, the need to work on complex, time-bound and exhausting tasks together with other people can damage individual creativity and productivity.  That‚Äôs why companies where people work efficiently <i>and</i> feel good seem almost unreal. <br><br>  Tom Sachs, a modern artist, famous in the part of the sculpture, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204644504576653261487906754">tells</a> about the work of his studio: <br><blockquote>  Sent this does not mean received - a wise thought.  Half of your business in this studio is the work itself, and the second half is a report about it.  What can I say when you have done something, but I do not hear or see?  No, I am not trying to control everything, but in the atmosphere of working on really complex things, even a simple nod, saying ‚Äúyes, I understand,‚Äù helps the cause to move forward. </blockquote><br>  The fact that Sachs tells about the kitchen of art is also relevant for any high-tech and intellectual work.  Ignoring the fact that you work with people in one way or another in any case always exacerbates the problem. <br><br>  Too high a priority for ‚Äúfinish everything‚Äù leads to the fact that we are doing more than we need in the end, and this is a real trap.  Yes, productivity means the fulfillment of tasks - but the normal course of work requires communication, during which the balance of what has been done and what has been done is pronounced. <br><br><h3>  Send one simple email </h3><br>  Moving forward, whatever that means, requires that your work be visible.  The easiest way to do this is just to tell.  No one can read minds.  But the difficulties begin in how to talk so as not to conflict with oneself.  For many, the mere thought of appearing boastful and too active in promoting their achievements is horrified and confused. <br><br>  In his <a href="http://bakadesuyo.com/2013/07/make-your-life-better">blog,</a> Erik Barker offers an elegant solution to this problem with minimal effort, which does not look like blowing up a peacock tail.  What are we talking about?  Just send one simple email each <b>week</b> to your superiors. <br><br>  Devote a couple of minutes on Friday to jot down the simplest summary of the tasks you have completed this week.  It will be easier for the authorities to make sure that there is progress, but it will also be nice that they are kept up to date and are not forced to guess what happens somewhere in your tasks. <br><br>  But the main potential of this one-email idea is to turn individual acts of self-promotion (or self-promotion, if you will) into ordinary and familiar information, which will gradually make you more convincing.  As long as the rest will be out of the question during the performance evaluation, you can already be in sight, as if ‚Äúthe first to come to mind‚Äù. <br><br>  It is not necessary to send such an email every Friday (and precisely on Friday).  Weekly for you - too often?  Do this once every two weeks, for example.  The main thing is to tell the authorities at least something!  In their language, manner, and with any frequency appropriate to the particular situation. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><i>UPD at the prompt from the comments</i> :</b> if you are connected to work with tools or task managers who themselves generate reports for the week, then perhaps you really should not write about everything in the mail.  However, if the tasks and projects you have carried out do not constitute a secret (NDA and all affairs), you can talk about them in social networks and professional communities, that is, to expand the scope of information. </blockquote><br><br>  At the same time (or at first, as an alternative), keep records for yourself, because once you have earned it is too easy to forget about what has been done.  Record this, and the data will always be at hand, including during the next evaluation of your effectiveness.  Well, of course, you yourself will be easier to assess where you are and where and how to move on, no matter how hard it sounds. <br><br><h3>  And here are three more tactics that allow you to be visible: </h3><br><h4>  <b>1.</b> Do not end the week unnoticed </h4><br>  Entrepreneur Patrick McKenzie advises working on more ‚Äúprominent" projects: <br><blockquote>  Try to work on what can be actively shown, and where people see you.  Work on what you can own.  Why?  The work that many people see is the best way to demonstrate that you are capable of doing just such things and the like. </blockquote><br><br>  And if shorter: ‚Äúoptimize the effect and visibility‚Äù.  The nature of intellectual activity is such that it is difficult for people to see its specific fruits.  Ask yourself: can I choose a more influential project?  Can I work on the part that is more in contact with living people?  Can I turn my knowledge of management, work with the client (s) or sales into a presentation or practical guide? <br><br><h4>  <b>2.</b> Ask for help and feedback. </h4><br>  People are often afraid to ask for help, as this may make them less competent.  In the meantime, this is a part of professional growth, as well as an indicator that you are active in your learning and correcting mistakes, in preventing problems. <br><br>  Management and your colleagues should be good at accepting an open request for help or feedback instead of your seclusion in a personal ‚Äúsafe corner‚Äù.  The latter tactic is, of course, instinctive (or intuitive) and simple, but consciously overcoming it will most likely give you an extra chance to crawl out of the routine. <br><br>  Call out, break the silence in the air, and also ask what you could help yourself later. <br><br><h4>  <b>3.</b> Work where you can be seen </h4><br>  Hours of visibility may require going outside the office.  Perhaps you will lead a third-party project.  And maybe the environment around you does not have this. <br><br>  In general, self-promotion does not necessarily consist in the existing conditions and concepts.  You can write books, start blogs, third-party projects, collaborate with people from other fields, or speak at panel discussions and conferences.  Tell about what you have done, what you are doing now, why it is important, and how exactly you achieved it. <br>  Whether you are an entrepreneur (person) or a staff member (person), a boss (person), or a job seeker (person) - but when you observe the ‚Äúdo and tell‚Äù bundle, you open your doors, and people understand to whom why can i go  This is your customer base, and potential partnerships and sponsorships. <br><br>  <b>Make the invisible visible</b> , gain influence, open up new perspectives. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305860/</a></p>
