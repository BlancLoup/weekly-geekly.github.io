At the beginning of this week <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dell-becomes-publicly-traded-again-december-28/">, the date</a> when Dell's securities came into circulation <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dell-becomes-publicly-traded-again-december-28/">became known</a> - December 28th.  At the same time, the IT giant announced that it would embark on the active development of a hybrid and public cloud.  Let's tell you what the point is. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/433156/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/re/yg/us/reyguslopbnkgj5vj-aibn0ldya.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dellphotos/26781029134/">Dell Inc.</a> photo</i></font>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Briefing on shares </h2><br>  Before turning to projects that are planning to develop in Dell, let's explain why the company needed to become public.  The fact is that Dell has a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2153393/dell-said-acquire-vmwares-us17-billion-tracking-stock">debt</a> in excess of $ 50 billion.  He appeared after Michael Dell borrowed money to buy EMC three years ago.  Since then, Dell has been trying to repay this debt.

      To eliminate the problem, Dell decided to become a public company, but without an IPO (this will save on all sorts of bureaucracy).  This would allow the company to additionally attract third-party investments.  Management considered two scenarios.  The first involved reverse-takeover with a VMware subsidiary.  But this option had to be abandoned, as it did not suit the shareholders and investors.  We wrote more about this <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/348238/">earlier in our blog on Habr√©</a> . <br><br>  The second scenario is related to the reorganization of stock stock VMware.  The idea is to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_stock">targeted (tracking) stocks</a> from VMware and put new Dell securities on the market. <br><br><blockquote>  Negotiations on this issue lasted for five months.  And last week there was a vote of shareholders who approved the deal.  Owners of tracking stocks will be able to sell their assets for $ 120 or exchange them for new securities.  Thus, the IT giant will become a public organization without an IPO. </blockquote><br>  After the public offering of shares, Dell <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/dells-long-game-is-in-hybrid-and-private-clouds/">plans to</a> actively develop hybrid and public cloud technologies. <br><br><h2>  Cloud Course </h2><br>  Hybrid clouds will become one of the leading destinations for Dell in 2019.  Dell plans to develop it with the help of the same VMware. <br><br>  Since the beginning of 2018, VMware has acquired three cloud startups: CloudHealth Technologies, CloudCoreo and Heptio.  The first two will develop products that help companies manage business processes in the public cloud and <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/enterprise-cloud/infrastructure-and-platform/vmware-flies-to-public-cloud-with-cloudhealth-acquisition/d/d-id/745680">control</a> spending on cloud resources.  As for Heptio, this is a company that <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/430714/">develops</a> solutions for deploying environments on Kubernetes.  Analysts <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2018/11/07/vmware-heptio/">expect</a> that Kubernetes may soon become the ‚Äústandard‚Äù for sweeping hybrid environments in the cloud. <br><br>  In this case, Dell and VMware will continue to work on the development of systems that simplify the tasks of system administrators in data centers.  In November, the tool for deploying a hybrid cloud and software data center VMware Cloud Foundation <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/data-center/vmware-and-dell-emc-tighten-vxrail-vxblock-integration-for-hybrid-cloud-easy-button-">received</a> integration with the hyperconvergent Dell EMC complexes - VxRail and VxBlock, built on vSphere and Virtual SAN.  This functionality should more closely link Dell hardware and software products into a single ecosystem. <br><br>  In addition to VMware, the development of multi-cloud with Dell will be another subsidiary of the IT giant - Pivotal.  While VMware will be engaged in the development of server technologies, Pivotal will focus on software solutions.  For example, in early December, Pivotal <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/blog/the-first-open-multi-cloud-serverless-platform-for-the-enterprise-is-here-try-out-pivotal-function-service-today">released an</a> open source platform for serverless computing in a hybrid cloud - Pivotal Function Service.  It is also based on Kubernetes. <br><br><h2>  Community opinions </h2><br>  One of the potential restructuring challenges is the deterioration in the financial position of Dell and VMware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/il/-r/td/il-rtdavoumw2jnf8naxvejkr68.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/br1dotcom/4297728868/">Bruno Cordioli</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br>  Under the terms of the transaction, the subsidiary must pay dividends to shareholders in the amount of several billion dollars.  Analysts estimate that because of this, VMware <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dell-ipo-that-isnt-an-ipo-what-you-need-to-know-2018-07-02">will remain</a> in the red by the end of the year.  Although, it is expected that next year the company will be a plus, the financial deficit may affect the speed of developing new products. <br><br>  Another problem is the possible reluctance of investors to buy Dell shares.  After the public offering, the controlling stake will be with Michael Dell, CEO of the company.  Dell is known on the market for his desire to "get everything at once" and "aggressive behavior."  This can scare off large investors, which will damage development plans. <br><br>  Although there are those who see positive sides in this whole story.  According <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4f127b34-f7b2-11e8-8b7c-6fa24bd5409c">to</a> one of the holders of trust shares and an investor in the hedge fund Josh Wood (Josh Wood), the restructuring of securities packages will help to unite the interests of shareholders of VMware and Dell.  This will reduce the number of differences in leadership and help companies come to a common vision of the future. <br><br>  Even before the official confirmation of the placement of Dell shares in Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-29/dell-is-said-to-eye-vmware-dell-under-one-roof-slashing-debt">they wrote</a> that the company's customers would only benefit from the deal.  When software from VMware integrates with Dell hardware, users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/dell-will-soon-be-a-public-company-again/">can buy</a> complete cloud solutions at a lower price.  Therefore, Dell has every chance to create a single hybrid ecosystem for data centers and clouds. <br><br><hr><br>  PS Posts on the topic from our blog on Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/proizvoditeli-oborudovaniya-i-iaas-gonka-za-oblachnym-trendom/">Equipment manufacturers and IaaS: the race for the cloud trend</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/zhelezo/servery-dlya-sap-osnovnye-platformy/">Servers for SAP: Basic Platforms</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/evolution-vmware-vmotion/">VMware vMotion Evolution: yesterday, today, tomorrow</a> </li></ul><br>  PPS More about cloud technologies in our Telegram channel: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/163">What is there in VMware: three new items</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/172">What else VMware has: virtualization tools</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/176">Where are supercomputers used now?</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433156/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433156/</a></p>
