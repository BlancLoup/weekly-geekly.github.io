  <section class="page js-page"><h1>FP8: Absolute Clone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ok, you can't make an interesting original game, but you can't even make clones.  And why?  Yes, everything is very simple - you can not copy.  Do not appreciate the brilliant statement of Leonardo da Vinci: who knows how to copy, he can do. <br><br>  What is the secret of the correct clone and why are most clones very bad? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Copying, as well as knowledge of the universe, is limited to our concepts.  You copy those features of the game that seem important to your success.  You seem important, but are they important?  How do you know?  If your concepts are good, then why are you writing a clone and not developing original products? <br><br>  I will even say a very complicated phrase: And if they are not good, then why do you continue to rely on them in the process of cloning and deciding which features to clone and how?

      You can watch hundreds of videos on YouTube from the creators of a successful title, read a lot of interviews, where they tell everything about the success of their creation, reveal all the secrets.  Yeah.  Here we must understand that Americans always lie, they at school age lie as you learn only for retirement, they can spend hours ‚Äúrevealing the secrets‚Äù of their success, but they will avoid all the key points. <br><br>  I will give a textbook example.  The famous Arnold Schwarzenegger told in the movie ‚ÄúPumping Iron‚Äù how a young bodybuilder approached him and asked for advice before an important performance, and he was not even a direct competitor for Arny, who readily gave him ‚Äúvaluable‚Äù advice.  The advice was that, supposedly, new trends in bodybuilding consist in making sounds during a speech: groan, growl, scream, rumble.  Above the hand raised, above the growl tone, below lowered - rumble brutally.  Needless to say, what happened to the man after the disgraceful speech on the mocking "tips" of the master? <br><br>  In this small example, as in a drop of water, the approach of all American discoverers of success is visible.  They can spend hours talking about game mechanics, focusing on certain units chips, as if revealing secrets with a light heart, but if you understand the talk code between the lines, it‚Äôs obvious that this is just a game advertisement, nothing substantial that would help they will not tell the clone writer.  Although they can veil the entire public appearance under the "internal mechanics", "tearing away the covers", but in fact they are only interested to once again charm the players with different chips, give the names and concepts that players could process their friends, increasing the popularity of the game. <br><br>  Just like you yourself, write an article on Habr, plainly disguising it as ‚Äúabout how we made the AAA clone‚Äù, and essentially promote the latest version of your creation, which you recently uploaded to Appstor, in the hope, in fact, raise profits, they, too, EVERYTHING disguised.  Understand necessary.  So you think you are so cunning, and they are fools-simpletons there?  Maybe the opposite?  Do you seriously assume that a person who LIVES on the income from the game will tell you the secret of her success?  Would you become?  Srabatyvet instinct of self-preservation.  The sweetest programmer in a checkered shirt, with humor tells, but at this time it works the same instinct as with the threat of a breach of the skull mount.  You want to live - learn to keep the Secret. <br><br>  Therefore, in an amicable way, you need to clone not the killer features, but pixel-by-pixel, screenwise, and completely the whole game, from the icon to the subtitles. <br><br>  The man copied from the game "the most important thing" from his deeply competent point of view, namely, there are posts and something jumps through them.  This is the most important, isn't it?  There is nothing else.  Game mechanics, "Tipo."  Twenty clones Flappi bad, well if one copies the trajectory along which the jump occurs.  Well, suppose that the author of the original game through trial and error, using if / else and math, achieved the ‚Äúsensation‚Äù of the correct movement of a bird in jumping from itself.  Only clone writers have no feeling, everything is simple, up, down, while the more intelligent ones have ‚Äústeep‚Äù - their own trajectory, from the head, from a big mind.  What is the original feeling.  Well, what if it is the trajectory that is exactly the same as in the original, the nose is the key to success, thanks to some psychological subtleties of perception?  Where is the confidence that this is so or not? <br><br>  I subdivide the important, key to the success of the cloned game features, at least four classes: <br><br>  1) the features that you copy, because you decided that they are important; <br>  2) features that you do not copy, because you decided that they are not important; <br>  3) features that you did not even notice and therefore do not copy; <br>  4) features in which even the author of the original himself is not aware of their presence or importance; <br><br>  For example, features of the third class in this classification, from the game, Engry Beds are evil birds.  The birds themselves.  Their evil faces.  Most of the clones do not have this, and I think in these evil faces on the icon and the screen saver there is a noticeable amount of success.  They are ‚Äúemotionally channeled‚Äù, they convey to the user the emotions that he must learn and for which he ultimately pays.  This is my purely personal opinion, I may be right or wrong, but your opinion is just as pure, and you need to rely not on opinions, but on a solid copy.  The author of the clone does not draw evil faces, he is sure that it does not matter.  But where is the guarantee? <br><br>  An example of a fourth-class feature is difficult to reliably provide, but purely hypothetically, suppose that the creator of Flappie Ice was too lazy to make a transition between attempts, and it is this peculiarity that the player immediately, without any pauses continues the gameplay, first after the crash created some kind of playable effect .  And in the next version, for example, the author of the original himself is no longer lazy and brings the matter to the end, makes a ‚Äúwasp‚Äù (awesome) transition, and for some reason the game no longer goes with a bang.  But the author does not even realize that the point is in the new cool transit, which the game has ISPORTED.  Here is a conditional example of a fourth class feature. <br><br>  That is, from the many details in the game, not only you, but no one at all knows what the secret of success is.  Hence the failure of most clones.  For you copy only what you see and understand.  Limited by their concepts.  And at least it would be necessary to copy everything that you see, if it is physically impossible to copy everything that is.  By the same vision or, simply, attention needs to be further developed. <br><br>  In childhood, my friends and I competed, who will remember more funny moments from the just watched movie.  It always amazed me how many things my friends noticed that I had not even noticed, not to mention remembering.  The programmer may wonder if he asks the artist how he sees the program, the interface, the game mechanics.  Artists have more developed attention, if in terms of an RPG, then the programmer has an attention of 15, the artist has 80. <br><br>  In general, if you cannot make an ABSOLUTE copy of the AAA game, then formally it is not a clone, it is ‚Äúbased on AAA‚Äù, ‚Äúinspired by AAA‚Äù, and a clone is a clone, they cannot be distinguished.  Totally.  And not only to you personally, but to any other person. <br><br>  Of course, you cannot sell an ‚Äúabsolute clone‚Äù, (or can you?), But you have to start with it.  Otherwise, inevitably miss something important.  Of course, you can be a very big brain and you know for sure exactly which features of the game affect success, but then you don‚Äôt have to make a clone, feel free to make original unique games and be confident of success.  But the problem is that you do not know these important moments, and you should not indulge yourself with illusions. <br><br>  In the West, there are people who know some of these keys, but they will not tell you, NEVER.  And even disguise themselves in the game and in their interviews, whatever you might guess, even with your super-brain.  Understand that even the simplest principles are ignored.  For example, the creator of the Bushnell genre of paid games, discovered one such secret, he said that the fact is that if a drunken farmer came to the gaming console at the bar, he immediately understood what to do.  But even he didn‚Äôt open this most important secret publicly; he leaked into public space after many years through former employees of the company.  Moreover, now understanding people ridicule this rule, they say that it is comic, that it is outdated, because they UNDERSTAND.  Let the simpletons make the wrong clones, not knowing what exactly to clone, break their destinies and return to where they belong, in wage labor for the more knowledgeable, for salary.  The key is the key, it must be kept in your pocket.  Do not show anyone.  And if dropped in public, sharply lift and say that it is not from the safe, but from an empty shed. <br><br>  Therefore, accept the fact that you are not given to find out which chip in the game is important and which is not - clone correctly, copy pixel-by-pixel, bit by bit, per second, absolutely. <br><br>  In conclusion, you are offered a small questionnaire, which theoretically should illustrate to us the degree of people's self-confidence in their concepts for evaluating key features of the game. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263977/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263977/</a></p>
