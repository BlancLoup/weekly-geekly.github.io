Three years have passed, and we decided to expand the functionality of our solution, and the accumulated experience allows us to approach this question with knowledge.  We offer a new tool that really differs from existing fundraising solutions - <a href="http://funding.to/">funding.to</a> .  Simple, convenient, functional, and most importantly without the limitations that most crowdfunding services impose on the creator of the project.  We immediately decided that our solution should be better due to the project launch speed, flexibility of use and financial optimization, expressed in reasonable commissions and minimization of costs. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Status </h5><br>  Analyzing the current state of affairs in the field of collective financing, we concluded that large foreign services have a number of drawbacks for the domestic user: a high commission of 10% - kickstarter, 8-12% rockethub;  the need for foreign details;  the specificity of the audience and the narrow focus of the project.

      Most Russian-language projects have a narrow specialization, and, in one way or another, are a localized version of the kickstarter.  A detailed analysis of Russian platforms is presented <a href="http://rusbase.vc/news/kraudfanding-v-rossii/">here</a> . <br><br>  The absolute majority of platforms work according to the ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù scheme (or you collect the full amount by the deadline, or do not receive a penny). <br><br><h5>  What are we better? </h5><br>  - the first and most important thing: <b>funding.to</b> is not a platform, <b>it is a tool</b> that allows you to organize a fundraising on any website and turn it into your own kickstarter; <br>  - quick start without pre-moderation, sandboxes and control.  All that is legal is entitled to your project; <br>  - freedom in choosing the terms of the project; <br>  - A wide range of deposit and withdrawal options; <br>  - low commission - <b>6.9%</b> (against average 10%). <br><br><h5>  Where to begin </h5><br>  To start working with funding. You need to create your own account that allows you to manage all the resources of our <a href="https://paysto.com/">paysto</a> network, which greatly simplifies all the financial management processes in your projects.  Short profile filling procedure, and you are already in the system.  To start a project in your account, select the funding.to tab and click the ‚Äúcreate page‚Äù button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a78/631/f55/a78631f554a4c9a7c925de07e12a4297.jpg"><br><br>  Then the fun begins.  In addition to the standard fields for project description, in which you need to specify the name of the project, its short and complete description, as well as pick up an illustration, there are several fields here that give users funding.to additional advantages. <br><br><h5>  Choose optimal conditions </h5><br>  Paysto tariff <a href="http://support.paysto.ru/KB/a147/fundingto.aspx">plans</a> provide you with ample opportunities when setting restrictions for your project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/603/e30/888/603e308887a168d20b13f41181e5ad34.jpg"><br><br>  Using the advantages of funding. To, you can choose from <b>four options:</b> <br>  - Specific amount to a specific date.  Habitual "All or Nothing."  If the entire amount is collected before the set date, then you receive it in full, if not - you do not receive anything. <br><br>  - The specific amount, but without a time frame.  You receive money only after the entire amount has been collected.  At the same time, you are not limited in time, which greatly increases your chances with proper promotion of the project in the network. <br><br>  - The exact end date.  You can set the date until which the receipt of funds will be relevant and collect the collected amount, regardless of its size, at the end of the term.  Perfect for batch financing and financing urgent projects. <br><br>  - The source of permanent funding.  You can set the parameters "amount unlimited" and "no end date" at the same time.  Such a project will be a way to permanently finance a project through crowdfunding.  You can at any time pick up the money received at the expiration of their <a href="http://support.paysto.ru/KB/a59/article.aspx">reservation</a> . <br><br><h5>  Visualize it! </h5><br>  <a href="http://funding.to/">Funding.to</a> provides you with a great tool, but how successful it will be to use depends only on you.  The key to quick and complete fundraising will be competent promotion of your project in the network.  In order to simplify the presentation of your project on other resources, we offer you an indispensable service: installation of a custom widget (informer), which in a dynamic way reflects the process of financing your project.  The most complete version, which includes illustration, title and statistics, looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/003/2c6/508/0032c650813512776e3a5b84859726d8.jpg"><br><br>  You can vary the settings, leaving only the title and text, the title and statistics, the title with or without a picture.  The name of the project founder is always displayed.  In addition, the service provides an opportunity to choose the color of the ‚Äúparticipate‚Äù button, which will allow for the most organically fit the widget into the design of any resource.  In total, we have prepared <a href="http://paysto.in/demo_funding_to.html">30 design options for informers</a> . <br>  The "participate" button will redirect the user to the fundraising page with your detailed description of the project, a form for depositing money and other information that you consider necessary to emphasize when creating the project <br><br><h5>  It's all? </h5><br>  Of course not!  Summing up, we can say that today, funding. Is one of the most flexible tools for personal fundraising on the Internet.  We are constantly working to improve our service, which, in addition to the features described, has a number of other advantages, which will necessarily be described in the following articles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217729/</a></p>
