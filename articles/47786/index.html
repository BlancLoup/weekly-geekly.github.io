  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The customer is always right! Or maybe not always?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, dear habrapayazhety. <br><br>  Everyone, without exception, knows a simple rule: "The customer is always right!".  I have been wondering for a very long time now: Is it always?  Or are there such situations when he may be wrong? <br>  My work is connected with the Internet, and specifically with the development of sites.  In this context, I will build my reasoning.  And in order not to be unfounded, I will cite as an example the situations that happened while communicating with the customer while developing one fairly large and complex project (of course neither the references, nor the names, nor other information that identifies this project, I will not, by virtue of many understandable circumstances). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, the project is quite large and has been under development for quite some time.  I joined the project development relatively recently.  Participated in its refinement (and currently involved), delivery and launch. <br><br>  So here.  In the process of working on a project, situations have occurred and are still occurring, when a previously coined, approved by the customer and the implemented functionality was altered almost entirely at the request of the client.  At the same time, the customer ‚Äúinvented‚Äù new ‚Äúchips‚Äù, which, in our opinion, harmed the general concept, structure and usability of the project.  So, in the course of communication with the client, the design of the site was radically changed, turning from a clear, logical, and thoroughly crafted product into the smallest details, in fact into a garbage bin.  At the same time, requirements are constantly being made to simplify and primitivize the user's activities on the site, which also led to a number of changes not only in design but also in the final usability of the project (It should be noted that we are not a newly created organization. We have quite substantial baggage completed (including large) projects. The staff includes adequate designers, layout designers, coders and editors). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      I am deeply convinced that in this case the customer should listen to the opinion of the contractor, because he may not know all the subtleties and processes occurring at the time of creation, placement and subsequent support of the project (as well as we cannot know the details of his business and advise him how to conduct this business). <br><br>  From all this, I had a question: Is the client right in this (and similar) case? <br>  I would also like to know if you had such situations and how did you solve such problems? <br><br>  Ps.  I apologize for the confusion ... I will be glad to discuss this and your similar situations in comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47786/</a></p>
