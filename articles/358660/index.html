We will be glad to see everyone at the event, but there are also some things for those who are absent: the reports of the first hall can be watched for free live on YouTube. <br><br>  Although this is only a part of the general conference program, there are many interesting things for various listeners: here there are ‚Äúadventures in the frontend‚Äù, Node.js performance, a mobile web, and so on until mining a crypt in the browser.

      Immediately inform the treasured link: <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/online-free/">holyjs-piter.ru/online-free</a> .  And under a cat we give descriptions of reports that have fallen into a free broadcast - you can run through them and quickly understand what you are interested in. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Day One (May 19) </h1><br><h2>  10:30 <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/2r1yg7w0no4ekomossmq8k/">Vitaly Friedman - New Adventures In Front-End, Season 2</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/et/82/11/et8211jbrifwfliolz3oe4hcnfi.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  One of the most notable speeches of the previous HolyJS was <b>Vitaly Friedman</b> ‚Äôs report ‚ÄúNew Adventures in Responsive Web Design‚Äù.  If you did not attend it personally, you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrgHLV2fe-2I">video</a> . <br><br>  And now Vitaly is returning with the new ‚ÄúNew Adventures‚Äù.  When you lead Smashing Magazine, you will learn a lot of front-end subtleties, difficulties and dirty tricks - so the report will touch on a variety of topics.  As the author warns, "you will not be able to" discern back "what you learn, and we are not responsible for your subsequent nightmares." <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h2>  12:00 <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/34qtehpc4ggmqymqyecusg/">Alexey Bogachuk - Solution Architecture and JavaScript</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nd/vh/go/ndvhgoqr9r8mtr0u6g3kptqprg8.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Often the architecture in JavaScript comes down to choosing a framework according to the latest trends in the frontend world.  And if you say that the choice of technology - this is only the seventh step in making a design decision?  Every day, many projects suffer losses or even fall apart due to incorrectly chosen architecture. <br><br>  Alexey will share stories that will help to correctly form the vision and significance of the architecture in modern applications, as well as prevent mistakes that can simply destroy your project. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h2>  13:45 <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/6jmw5lonz6qsceecq0wc0i/">Nikolay Ryzhikov - Make frontend ‚Äúbackend‚Äù again</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oh/bm/-l/ohbm-l_tbrkymqt_m8ammdoy2k8.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Effective user interface design so far, even with modern reactors and angulyars, is a pain and loss.  It takes a long time, the result is unreliable and unsatisfactory.  In the report we will try to understand the sources of the substantial and random complexity of the development of faces.  And using the example of the ClojureScript &amp; Reagent &amp; Re-frame stack, let's see how you can do anything about it. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h2>  15:30 <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/2tmryuscgwykqms0ouqees/">Denis Radin - Mine browsing in the browser: WebWorkers, GPU, WebAssembly and other good things</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jt/bk/f6/jtbkf6xxkq-3d87fnsrggjq8wyy.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Denis visitors are already familiar with HolyJS, for example, according to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DP-OOg9z4OUg">report</a> ‚ÄúUI Components on Pixel Shaders‚Äù, and his main work is connected with photorealistic web games, but now he will speak on a completely different topic.  A year ago, they consulted him on the question ‚ÄúIs it possible to mine cryptocurrency in the browser using the GPU‚Äù, and Denis investigated the question - and now he is ready to share his knowledge about what to expect when to use the pool of browser miners. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h2>  17:00 <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/4nd6jfohg8egu4iaemweco/">Nikolay Matvienko - Decomposition of Main Thread in Node.js to increase throughput</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zw/zt/-7/zwzt-7dpv7k8neq41wjl3q_quoc.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Increased functionality in Enterprise Node.js applications often leads to a decrease in throughput.  In this report, we begin with the dispersion of Main Thread (the main thread of Node.js) and decompose it into a spectrum of operations performed in it.  We learn which of these operations we can transfer to separate threads / workers / processes and how to do it.  We will choose successful parallelization methods for each type of operation, consider their advantages and limitations.  In addition to standard methods, we will also consider alternative solutions for parallelizing tasks using the features of V8 and libuv thread pool.  Finally, we compare how the application architecture and bandwidth change after decomposing Main Thread. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h2>  18:30 <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/1v8mkykc9cueiacgy0u4uo/">Maxim Yuzva - Flickering technology, or 21st century engineering</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m-/la/bv/m-labvnidzfek0b9dj_bbv6q2cg.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  We write code.  The interpreter follows our instructions clearly.  He does not object, does not argue, you do not need to negotiate with him.  Everything is clear and to the point.  For this we love programming, because it is - the full power in the world created by us.  That is why the best programmers do not tolerate communication with something as imperfect as people, with their endless emotions, needs and fads. <br><br>  How to sell refactoring on a project, how to convince colleagues to introduce Linter or how to stop steaming, what to write on: Angular, React or Vue? <br><br>  So, how to become an engineer of the XXI century?  Maxim Yuzva - frontend-tmlid, hiring and resource manager in EPAM Systems;  FrontSpot community organizer and BeerJS frequenter. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h1>  Day Two (May 20) </h1><br><h2>  10:30 <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/3kqgwfxzz6wkuwk0qywsoc/">Imad Elyafi - Bringing mobile web back to life</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wg/oc/t1/wgoct15plx3-am1rfqhgfcbxri0.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  In Pinterest, where Imad is now working, the mobile web version has been redesigned on a large scale, having managed with this for 11 weeks.  As a result, it was possible to achieve a result close to native applications, while maintaining a fast download speed.  User engagement metrics have increased dramatically.  But this path was not strewn with roses, so Imad will tell you what difficulties they encountered along the way and how they overcame them. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h2>  12:00 <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/1roxvxhrgaewyuyeamiyu2/">Roman Dvornov - Components Catalog: Rethinking</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b3/l1/vo/b3l1vovi313bgv2mbbuam_0ehik.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  In Avito, where Roman works, develop their catalog of components.  This report is the answer to the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù When there are already ready-made solutions.  Topics to be covered: <br><br><ul><li>  How to represent components, demonstrate their capabilities, technical solutions for this </li><li>  What functions can be useful to designers and developers </li><li>  How to identify components, collecting and linking meta-information, organizing a knowledge base </li><li>  Information about the places of use of components and ownership of the code </li><li>  Going beyond the borders of the catalog and its ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù with other internal services </li></ul><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h2>  13:45 <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/iohsovny46ymw2g6ugi2g/">Yevgeny Gusev and Ilya Taratuhin - Reservoir Dogs, season 2: React vs Vue</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lm/rg/o6/lmrgo6kyqmoin5tunq9rml4z_ki.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  "Do you smell it?"  This is a frontend, son.  Nothing else in the world smells like that. <br><br>  I love the smell of the front end in the morning.  Once we refactored one feature for twelve hours in a row.  And when it was all over ... There was not a single unchanged file. <br><br>  Someday this framework war will end ... ‚Äù <br><br>  Yes, we are with you again!  This time, the experts Mr. Blue (Ilya Taratukhin) and Mr. Green (Evgeny Gusev) are taking new heights by storm: our old friend Star and Striped React is trying to defend the frontier before the rapidly advancing Vue.  Around the explosions, front-fighters here and there ... So, stand, this analogy has gone too far.  Let's take it easy: let's look at the two frameworks and see what they look like, how they differ, and who will win in this war? <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h2>  15:30 <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/2wplwkamfw2wuqkeoiiikk/">Nikita Prokopov - Gaining Skills</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_2/kh/cb/_2khcb7hdr6of515j436d7yabpo.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  How do people learn new skills and what are the consequences for programmers.  Five stages of pumping: beginner, advanced, competent, specialist, expert.  The main points: how to properly train programmers, who work effectively with someone in a team, how to proceed to the next level, the nature of disputes and advice. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h2>  17:05 <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/6jl89tfvg8mseuyawmya0q/">Mikhail Poluboyarinov - What to expect from JavaScript in 2018?</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hi/_v/1c/hi_v1c7mljid1klhz7r0texjefk.png" width="200" align="left">  In January, a regular meeting of the TC39 committee was held, at which the ES2018 specification was finally formed.  In her footsteps, Mikhail Poluboyarinov, the organizer of PiterJS and IT Global Meetup, a developer with 18 years of experience, a member of the HolyJS Program Committee, will go on a performance. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h2>  18:35 <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/4hosxpleygg2kqkia8mqs0/">Ilya Klimov - 30: too many javascript</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qy/d2/so/qyd2soe3xafdofjgqimdk4bwd80.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  ‚ÄúI'm 30 and I'm old.  Ok, in fact it is still 29, and I am super-star (at least my mother always told me so, but can she be wrong?), But now I can clearly see the limitations of my brain on processing information, perceiving new content and learning. <br><br>  Our industry is growing explosively.  Did you think a couple of years ago that at a conference with JavaScript in the title we‚Äôll dive into the depths of AST, learn assembly inserts for a better understanding of V8 performance and be interested in Rust (because WebAssembly is the same!)?  This report is the answer to three questions asked by Ilya every week several times by his students: <br><br><ul><li>  How to learn what you need, but not HYIP </li><li>  How to structure information for the fastest mastering? </li><li>  Where to run? </li></ul><br>  Ilya hates talking about space ships plowing the endless expanses of the Bolshoi Theater.  His goal is that after the report everyone will come out, if not with a firm understanding of what, how and when to learn in JS, then at least with the knowledge of how to gain this understanding. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358660/</a></p>
