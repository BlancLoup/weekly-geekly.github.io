  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Meet HP IT Outsourcing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is unlikely that our audience needs to explain what IT outsourcing is.  In the period of growth of the Russian IT market, this direction has been developing at a faster pace, and with the popularization of cloud services, it has acquired qualitatively new forms.  But how much do we know about the leaders of the global IT outsourcing market and their activities in Russia, such as Hewlett-Packard? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/733/909/3e5/7339093e5b224a6eafafa53ba10a02d2.jpg"></div><br>  Interestingly, back in 2007, with the assistance of HP, the book ‚Äú <a href="http://h/">IT Outsourcing: Building Mutually Beneficial Cooperation</a> ‚Äù (Managing Successful IT Outsourcing Relationships) by renowned European authors and IT market professionals Peter Gottschalk and Hans Solly-Setera entered the Russian market.  Since then, important changes have occurred in the industry.  HP's business is changing.  But the outsourcing direction continues to evolve. <br><br>  <b>Hewlett Packard Enterprise</b> - this is how the new company will be called from November 1, 2015, which will offer corporate systems (servers, storage systems, network equipment), as well as software to ensure their operation.  The company will provide various implementation and support services (including financial services) for such systems with customers and outsourcing services that were previously the responsibility of the HP Enterprise Group. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The task of Hewlett Packard Enterprise is not only to ensure the development and updating of all product families in order to offer more advanced solutions in the context of significant changes in the IT market: application transformations, jobs, data growth, but also to provide modern services to customers, helping them reduce costs and increase profits.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc4/f1c/ea6/fc4f1cea69fe4cc39f0b22027b88274b.png"><br>  In our country, being one of the leading players in the IT market, HP (for the time being we will call it by this familiar name) is familiar to many of its IT products - servers, storage systems, printers and PCs.  Much less, she is known for her services, in particular, for IT outsourcing services, although in the last decade the Russian industry press has periodically introduced us to its success stories in this area.  After all, ‚ÄúHP Russia‚Äù is also outsourcing, consulting and integration.  Here we will talk about this in more detail.  Despite the trend of "import substitution", the Russian business landscape is already difficult to imagine without the world's leading corporations offering outsourcing services.  And HP has the widest range of offers - from <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/reviews/ppt/2013_10_10/5_Ushakova.pdf">print outsourcing</a> (HP MPS) to <a href="http://www8.hp.com/kz/ru/software-solutions/software.html%3FcompURI%3D1079461">business process</a> outsourcing (BPO). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">Back in trend</font> </h2><br>  It is characteristic that IT outsourcing "comes into vogue" along with another economic downturn, forcing companies to think about turning fixed costs into variables - to shift CAPEX to OPEX.  The desire to reduce costs and improve business efficiency, increasing with each crisis, spurs demand for outsourcing.  Moreover, IT companies often position this type of service as a way to reduce costs and the ability to concentrate on their core business.  Against the background of a widespread reduction in IT outsourcing budgets, there are chances of becoming one of the few growing types of services.  However, according to analysts, in the world about half of IT outsourcing projects are unsuccessful, since their implementation does not bring the planned results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/756/b1b/d49/756b1bd49a13920294133a5b2febfd08.png"><br>  <em><font color="#999999">Priorities in IT strategies of Russian companies, <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/reviews/ppt/2013_10_10/5_Ushakova.pdf">according to IDC</a> .</font></em>  <em><font color="#999999">This survey was conducted before the crisis, when the task of cost optimization was not yet as urgent as it is today.</font></em> <br><br>  In fact, the crisis plays both positive and negative.  On the one hand, contracts are being reduced.  On the other hand, companies are trying to solve their problems by shifting them to a service provider.  And this opens up a potentially new market, gives a chance to strong outsourcers. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">In the first positions</font> </h2><br>  HP has long been one of the recognized world leaders in the IT outsourcing market, offering its customers a wide range of services, starting with outsourcing support for user workplaces and ending with a global strategic partnership for maintaining information systems.  By outsourcing core IT services, customers can free up additional resources and focus on core business.  <a href="http://h/">The results are</a> sometimes impressive indeed. <br>  Thanks to outsourcing, customers gain competitive advantages - HP has gained considerable experience in the global outsourcing market as a provider of solutions and services for various types of enterprises and their tasks.  The company's global outsourcing resources bring in specialists from various countries along with consultants from HP Competence Centers.  Moreover, HP has the ability to provide remote control based on its own data centers and remote support centers.  These services allow you to quickly assess risks and prevent their occurrence. <br><br>  According to Gartner ( <a href="http://h/">2015 Magic Quadrant for Data Center Outsourcing in North America</a> ), HP is one of the leaders in the North America data center outsourcing market.  Its strengths are that analysts attribute the scale of the infrastructure - about 80 thousand physical servers in 30 data centers allow us to provide a wide variety of outsourcing services. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/230/82a/34d/23082a34dfe6847e3e0ec63ae2721f82.jpg"></div><br>  <em><font color="#999999">The volume of cloud services based on <a href="http://h/">HP Helion</a> in the global market shows a two-digit growth.</font></em> <br><br>  In Russia, HP is actively working on outsourcing with manufacturing enterprises, retail chains, and the energy industry. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">Russian data center - from the "classics" to the clouds</font> </h2><br>  The HP outsourcing division is now concentrating on two main areas - classic outsourcing, when the customer company outsources a certain amount of IT operations, and to provide cloud services from the partner Russian data center - DataPro's data center.  The data center in Russia was chosen by HP at the global level in accordance with strict criteria. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fa/9d2/255/4fa9d2255b3d6a541b210ec436d68dc6.png"><br>  <em><font color="#999999">DataPro Moscow One is the largest data center in Eastern Europe.</font></em>  <em><font color="#999999">It is designed for 3000 racks and a power of 25 mW.</font></em>  <em><font color="#999999">The data center is certified by the Uptime Institute in terms of TIER III reliability - ‚ÄúDesign‚Äù and ‚ÄúFacility‚Äù; in 2016, certification of Operational Sustainability is expected.</font></em> <br><br>  Currently, the cloudy direction is developing rapidly and has already become a fairly large business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b5/567/245/6b55672450df34329424fd38eba8d875.png"><br>  <em><font color="#999999">From private to public.</font></em>  <em><font color="#999999">The concept of HP involves various options for implementing a <a href="http://www.hpcloud.com/">cloud model</a> , depending on the needs of customers.</font></em> <br><br>  The data center hosts both IT infrastructure and customer applications.  Moreover, customers are provided with a dedicated infrastructure for specific tasks.  Servers - virtual or physical - are allocated to a specific customer, and not shared between clients, as in ‚Äúmulti-tenant‚Äù environments, which guarantees a higher quality of service. <br><br>  The IT infrastructure in the data center is built according to a certain methodology, but it can be any equipment - both HP and other vendors.  That is, the basic offers and configurations can be extended if necessary.  Optional equipment can be purchased by HP in consultation with the customer and provided to it under a leasing scheme (with payment within a certain period of time - from one to five years), or the customer can acquire the required equipment, which is housed in the data center and maintained by HP.  Of course, HP hardware remains a priority, especially since the HP outsourcing unit can get good discounts when purchasing equipment in HP ESG.  Additional flexibility gives the possibility of using the resources of European HP data centers - applications and IT infrastructure. <br><br>  As for <a href="http://www.osp.ru/lan/2002/04/136023/">leasing</a> , it allows organizations to focus their attention and funds on the core business, eliminates the need to solve the issues of recycling outdated equipment, and therefore it is beneficial not only for companies that lack working capital.  Leasing significantly reduces the cost of upgrading equipment and in many cases becomes the only possible way to expand business.  However, in case of leasing, the customer assumes certain risks and may incur financial losses specified in the contract upon early termination of the agreement. <br><br>  The desire of customers to reduce IT costs, cut budgets for the purchase of equipment makes them pay attention to cloud services.  In many cases, monthly payments are more profitable than one-time large investments. <br><br>  In the process of assessing and designing the IT infrastructure for the customer, he is offered various options.  The customer receives transparent information about the formation of its service payments - the cost of equipment and the cost of service for the term of the contract. <br><br>  Definitely, the service is not the cheapest in the Russian market, although it competes in prices with the offers of local outsourcers.  However, in the service of HP, the main focus is on quality and long-term cooperation, and not on price.  Nevertheless, HP prices are quite comparable with Russian companies, and for international companies they may even be lower. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">What is the benefit?</font> </h2><br>  Briefly list the main benefits for customers who decide to use HP IT outsourcing: <br><br><ul><li>  The possibility of leasing equipment, both ruble and dollar.  HP Financial Services fixes the price in rubles or dollars at the time of the transaction, there are no financial risks. <br><br></li><li>  The stability of the company.  Even in the turbulent market conditions, HP is ‚Äúplaying long games,‚Äù and this is especially important for large international companies.  In any case, it is important for the customer to know that there is some kind of guarantee, and tomorrow the outsourcer will not go anywhere. <br><br></li><li>  Access to all HP European centers.  They can solve problems in the cloud infrastructure of the customer.  There is the possibility of using the "knowledge base" HP to solve complex technical issues. <br><br></li><li>  Strict observance of SLA parameters, such as service availability, response time to incidents, according to the Help Desk - the number of lost calls.  Note that HP's SLAs are tougher than typical ones for the local market. </li></ul><br>  Finally, placing the equipment is only part of the solution.  Need a software.  HP has agreements with software vendors that allow them to buy software from them at prices substantially lower than market prices, which, in turn, affects the cost of services provided to customers. <br><br>  During its activity on the Russian market, HP has accumulated considerable experience in working with customers from various industries.  Here are just a few examples of the most iconic projects.  Although not as big as HP's once-acclaimed global contract with Procter &amp; Gamble for outsourcing information systems totaling $ 3 billion or a contract with the Finnish energy giant, Fortum. <br><br>  The best examples of the benefits and benefits of HP IT Outsourcing are concrete examples. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">A bit of history</font> </h2><br>  In 2005, <a href="http://outsourcing.jofo.ru/106197.html">RUSAL</a> outsourced key applications to HP.  HP has taken on the task of managing their services using advanced techniques, technologies and expertise.  Project work included data migration to the HP platform, as well as operational and service support for five years.  The objectives of the project were to increase the operational safety and economic efficiency of the customer, to improve the service support of business units and the introduction of modern proven technologies. <br><br>  In 2008, HP, in partnership with CROC, won a tender for the provision of IT infrastructure support services to <a href="http://www.dist-cons.ru/PressRelease/PressReleaseShow.asp%3Fid%3D28840">British American Tobacco</a> (BAT Russia).  This is one of the largest contracts in the Russian IT outsourcing market.  The task of the KROK-HP tandem was to ensure the functioning of a unified support service for all departments of the company. <br><br>  As part of the contract, HP provided the customer with contact center services, equipment and software lifecycle management, including IT procurement, IT warehouse management, and technological support for mobile communication services, starting from the contract negotiation process and ending with processing mobile operator bills and equipment replacement as well as SAP system support.  The presence of highly qualified specialists and significant expertise of HP in SAP support has become one of the important factors for winning the tender. <br>  From mid-2010, HP begins to support Fortum in Russia, and at the same time begins a major project to integrate the Russia Division into the global IT infrastructure of Fortum Corporation.  The project affected more than 2000 users at 20 addresses in 5 cities of Russia. <br><br>  Over 9 years of close cooperation, we have gained tremendous experience in IT outsourcing with one of the leaders in the field of energy.  In 2013, the contract between Fortum and HP was extended for another 3 years, during which the main objectives of HP will be to provide services to one of the key Customers under the agreed SLA and maintain user satisfaction at a high level, as well as create the most profitable and comfortable conditions for business development Fortum Russia. <br><br>  This is not the only HP outsourcing contract in the tobacco industry.  Together with CROC, a project was launched for another major tobacco company - the companies won the tender for providing Help Desk and Workplace Support services to the customer throughout Russia. <br><br>  In 2011, <a href="http://www.retail-loyalty.org/news/rolf-zaklyuchil-s-hp-pyatiletnee-soglashenie-na-upravlenie-servernoy-i-setevoy-infrastrukturoy-/">ROLF</a> transferred its business-critical infrastructure and applications to the HP cloud.  The project was successful, and the customer decided to outsource HP, including local server and network IT infrastructure.  The transfer of HP to the management of network and server infrastructures improved the efficiency of all divisions of ROLF, and the IT department focused on important strategic tasks and new services for businesses. <br><br>  HP was able to guarantee a comprehensive delivery of the servers, network systems, software products and services needed by the customer as a single manufacturer.  The specialists of HP Enterprise Services took over the upgrade, transformation, and then support for the server and network infrastructure of the customer.  The processes and technologies of system administration were automated and standardized. <br><br>  Launched four years ago, the project has now passed all stages of the HP service.  It began on the basis of Utility Services in Germany, then was transferred to Cloud VPS, and a year and a half ago moved to the Russian data center.  Now this project continues to evolve. <br><br>  In early 2003, the HP Outsourcing Division, along with C &amp; I divisions, was separated from HP Technology Services (TS), which supports the equipment supplied to customers.  Then <a href="http://www8.hp.com/ru/ru/hp-news/press-release.html%3Fid%3D32826">came the EDS</a> . <br><br>  Currently, about 250 people work in HP Enterprise Services in Russia, all of them are involved in the service to one degree or another.  There is a division dedicated to the special CMS service for the telecommunications sector. Its specialists are implementing software developed for the telecommunications industry.  This is a significant part of the HP outsourcing business in Russia.  Customers are the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù operators, plus such large operators as Tele2 and Rostelecom. <br><br>  The main task of HP is to create conditions for the development and successful functioning of the company's main business.  This allows you to maximally free the customer from solving operational problems related to IT and infrastructure, allowing him to concentrate on truly strategic tasks.  For this, HP has all the necessary competencies and tools and services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268097/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268097/</a></p>
