Now we will tell you about the preparation of the premises, the magical bugs when transferring computers, vomiting and opening a VR club in order to at least beat off fixed costs. <br><br>  You can look at it endlessly - as a woman destroys a quest and frees up space for a VR club: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://coub.com/embed/s2p8a" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Design project and construction </h2><br>  In Novosibirsk "Quest House" the first quest "Breaking Bad" was opened.  It is outdated morally and physically, so the right decision would be to close it and convert it into a virtual quest.  So we did.

This is too much for a virtual quest, where there will be 4 chairs, 4 computers and 4 Oculus.  Therefore, we decided to divide the area: <br><br><ol><li>  15 m¬≤ was spent on the virtual quest itself.  No more.  As it turned out, this area is enough for both our sedentary quest and the game with <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/oculus-touch-controller">Oculus Tachim</a> standing. </li><li>  17 m¬≤ was spent on the common area.  We called it a gathering area.  This is a room that can be rented additionally, have a DR there or play on the desk. </li><li>  5 m¬≤ was spent on the reception.  With the growing number of quests, we became in dire need of an area from which we could give hints. </li></ol><br>  But back to the room for a virtual quest.  Our hypothesis was this: all the virtual reality rides do not look like super technological inventions.  We wanted the person at first glance at the virtual quest room to understand that there is a high-tech zone here. <br><br>  We turned to our interior designer, who does visualization of reality quests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16d/282/fce/16d282fceb31461eb0022cbe73753e2f.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="b0b0b0">The result was a very futuristic room.</font></i> <br><br>  We estimated all repairs at 200,000 rubles at the rate of 10,000 rubles per square meter.  We allocate this budget to the common areas of Quest Houses.  The amount was spelled out in the TC for the designer, respectively, and the design was made so that we fit into that amount.  But everything again went wrong, as we had planned. <br><br>  We invited 3 construction teams, mainly selected by the method of recommendations.  The first guys came in fashionable shirts, which was already strange.  Estimated repair "by eye" in 350 000 rubles without materials and left. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f7/7f7/4ab/0f77f74abca541709f79dc4d16ae85ed.jpeg"><br>  <i><font color="b0b0b0">The photo is taken from the site <a href="http://vasilich.spb.ru/modnaya-chernaya-rubashka-foto.html">"Fashionable black shirt photo"</a></font></i> <br><br>  The latter were more like builders, but their estimate, again, was "by eye".  They estimated their work at 150,000 rubles.  Already closer.  Third - 135,000 rubles.  But most importantly, they made a clear estimate of the work.  They estimated not by eye, but really based on the amount of work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d11/8bf/c57/d118bfc5732c469f82a48b23fcc133a4.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="b0b0b0">Estimate for everything except futuristic doors</font></i> <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe1/8b0/973/fe18b0973d974d288d2f2174039cd751.jpg">  About the door should be said separately.  The picture shows the scheme of the doors.  First, the left side opens.  2 players enter, the door closes behind them.  And after that they open the door in front.  Something like this goes through the disinfection procedure before entering the secret laboratory, I think.  But there was a problem: the cost of the doors would be 150,000 rubles, and this is without installation! <br><br>  As a result, we abandoned the expensive doors and decided to make sliding mirrored, like a closet.  We selected a third contractor.  The only team that prepared the estimate, and this is already worth a lot (who made repairs, he will understand). <br><br><h2>  Buying Oculus and Lip Motion Sensors.  The choice of computers and chairs </h2><br>  <b>Oculus Rift</b> <br><br>  Having started repair, we were puzzled with purchase of the equipment.  The Oculus Rift CV1 helmets came out only in the summer of 2016, it was impossible to buy them directly in Russia, the company simply did not send them.  Services that provide a US address, also did not work.  I think Okulus tracked down their addresses and simply didn‚Äôt send packages there, canceling the order.  We tried shipito.com and pochtoy.com services.  Anyone else trying was unsafe.  Since about them too little information on the Internet. <br><br>  We faced a problem - how to buy helmets in the United States.  The exit was our friend who flew to Las Vegas for a poker tournament.  He grabbed Leap Motion helmets and controllers for one thing. <br><br>  The total amount for the purchase of equipment came out: 3 440 dollars or 232,200 rubles.  For 800 bucks, every helmet came out plus 60 - Leap controller. <br><br>  <b>Computers</b> <br><br>  With computers, the situation was simpler.  We read the recommended system requirements from the Oculus and picked up such computers in Novosibirsk.  But like any normal Russian, we decided to save.  When testing on home computers, we did not notice any problems with the game and graphics.  Therefore, we decided to buy a video card easier. <br><br>  Each cost us 40 470 rubles.  The configuration came out like this: <br><br><ul><li>  Power Supply 500W ATX ExeGate UN500 </li><li>  Video card ASUS GeForce GTX 950 STRIX 2GB. </li><li>  Toshiba 1Tb P300 HDWD110UZSVA 3.5 "7200rpm 64Mb SATA3 Hard Drive </li><li>  Trin Q1, ATX, MidiTower, Black </li><li>  CoolerBoss Xiaolong CAH-209-03 Cooler </li><li>  Motherboard MSI B150M PRO-VDH, Socket1151, iB150, 4DDR4, PCI-Ex16, 6SATA3, 7.1-ch, 6USB 3.1, VGA, DVI, HDMI, mATX, Retail </li><li>  8GB DDR4 DIMM Memory (2x4Gb) PC17000 2133MHz Kingston HyperX FURY Black Series CL14 (HX421C14FBK2 / 8) </li><li>  Intel Core i5-6400 Skylake 2700MHz 6Mb TDP-65W Socket1151 processor </li></ul><br>  Total amount: 202,350 rubles (4 computers + 1 server). <br><br>  <b>Armchairs</b> <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76e/8f8/aa8/76e8f8aa87ab4070bcb30212e48e154e.jpg">  We considered and we believe that the chairs are very important.  We did not want to buy ordinary chairs for 300 rubles, in which we played the virtual quest of competitors.  We wanted to impress the client before the game, remember? <br><br>  For the chairs were the following requirements: <br><br><ul><li>  They should fit into the design. </li><li>  They should be comfortable. </li><li>  They should be with armrests.  This is important for the virtual quest, because otherwise the hands are very tired of the constant game. </li></ul><br>  All this suited to the chairs from the cinema.  But the problem is that such companies take only large lots, immediately to the hall-two.  And we only needed 4 seats.  In a toga from 14 companies, only 1 agreed to fulfill our order. <br><br>  The cost of one: 15 070 rubles. <br>  Total expenses for 4 seats: 60 280 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a46/6d5/d7c/a466d5d7ce384d2cb744e8b5f99b0b33.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="b0b0b0">The final result.</font></i>  <i><font color="b0b0b0">Find 5 differences</font></i> <br><br><h2>  Nezhdanchik with updating the Oculus.  Infinite rakes </h2><br>  But back to the development of the quest.  For tests, all the equipment we placed in the office.  We collected a simple network with a server and 4 computers.  Already at this stage the whistlers began: the computers simply did not see Oculus helmets via HDMI.  We reinstalled the driver, reread all the forums.  The tips were as follows: reinstall Windows, motherboard drivers, video card drivers, Oculus.  They offered to poke at different ports, in general, to dance with a tambourine and call the shamans. <br><br>  So we missed 2 days.  2 days, Carl.  And by chance we got the idea that everything worked at home.  In the system user profile, the installation logs were found in the temporary files of the Okulus installer.  In general, it looked like unpacking several installers of individual components and installing them in unattended mode.  Because of this, we did not see the error of one of them - swore on a nonexistent path to the directory with temporary files.  In the log, the symbols of the Russian alphabet were turned into kryakozyabry.  This prompted the idea that even in 2016 there is software that does not know how to use non-English file system paths. <br><br>  Having created a new user with an English login and having made the installation under him and - ta-daaam - we got a working Oculus.  This was the first, but not the last lesson. <br><br>  To start the game, you run the virtual quest server on the server computer.  You connect 4 computers by IP-address and then start the game.  At the same stage, you can choose from what point the players will start playing. <br><br>  Since we were in the office, all the staff suddenly became testers.  At first, this position was privileged and everyone asked to play a quest, but gradually it became punishment and punishment.  Playing the same game for whole days is still fun! <br><br>  Tests boiled down to several things: <br><br><ul><li>  Whether the mechanics of riddles were implemented correctly.  It was important not to lose the ideas of the scriptwriter.  Any concession could turn into a boring and uninteresting game. </li><li>  Does the game work correctly with 1, 2, 3 and 4 players?  Inside the game, players interact with each other, see each other's actions.  In addition, some puzzles work differently depending on the number of players. </li><li>  Graphics, voice acting and interactive inserts. </li><li>  Catching other bugs.  Bugs hid everywhere.  You could accidentally fall into textures.  But there were some funny ones: when you walked the stairs and fell into the abyss, sometimes you would appear at the start in the belly of a giant frog!  Katya, our avid tester from the development department, was especially amused. </li></ul><br>  First, problems started with Leap controllers.  They are constantly turned off.  They had to be regularly restarted.  It turned out that the solution was to put maximum power on the USB ports.  This solved the problem. <br><br>  Most of the problems arose due to the fact that the developers were from another city.  Our equipment differed dramatically.  Participate in the tests they could not, again, because of the distance.  It turned out that their functionality works, we run it with us - nifiga.  At some point we began to despair, because no one could understand what was the matter.  We had only licensed software, we excluded, as it seemed to us, any jambs from our side.  But the problem remained - we had a terrible fps when 3 and 4 people were playing.  It was impossible to play. <br><br>  As a result, at one of the forums we read that the case could be in a bespereboynik.  We had one uninterruptible 600 W on 4 computers.  A power supply in each computer for 500 watts.  As a result, we invested another 19 441 rubles, bought another 3 bespereboynik of 500 W each.  And, about a miracle, jambs have stopped.  We thought the hardest thing was over!  But where is there? <br><br>  Then we started having performance problems with video cards.  This coincided with the <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/asynchronous-spacewarp">update version of the Oculus</a> .  The computers suddenly began to not cope with the load, the game began to slow down, and the computer began to heat up. <br><br>  Plus, we noticed that on the first computer (only Palit GeForce GTX1060 6Gb graphics card was on it), the fps was at 60 frames per second, and on the rest: 25-30.  As a result, we decided that we need to purchase the same cards for the others.  The result: another 63,600 rubles of unforeseen investments.  Saved!  Now the average FPS is around 80-90 frames per second. <br><br><h2>  Toshnilovka.  Test results </h2><br>  This word has become the key when working with virtual quests.  All test teams enjoyed playing the quest.  But when they began to feel sick, they simply could not continue the game.  Only 70 percent wanted to continue after the first 50 minutes of the game.  The remaining 30 simply could not. <br><br>  What makes you sick?  The main reason is that the brain believes in the picture and the movements that take place, and the vestibular apparatus says that it sits still and sends a signal to the body, that it seems to be poisoned and you need to get rid of the poison.  It sounds weird, but it does work that way. <br><br>  We have read, probably, all the articles about nausea in virtual reality and how to combat rocking motion in general.  The main recommendations are as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  The room should be cool.  We immediately put the air conditioner, this is no problem. </li><li>  The room should be fresh air.  When 4 people played the quest, it became too stuffy, there was not enough air, and this contributed to nausea.  We did intake ventilation to solve this problem. </li><li>  Candy, cold water.  We placed all this in the gathering area. </li><li>  Maximum realistic picture and high quality graphics. </li><li>  Hold a stable high FPS (above 60), without drawdowns. </li><li>  Lack of sharp movements, turns and movement in the vertical plane; </li><li>  reduction in indirect movements and accelerations; </li><li>  discrete movements when a person looks at the point at which he moves; </li><li>  All actions in VR should be intuitively expected and predictable: if a player raises his head, then in VR he must raise his view angle, otherwise the vestibular apparatus will not understand what is happening; </li><li>  the use of products containing ginger before and during immersion in vr; </li><li>  Immerse yourself in vr gradually, starting from small time intervals, our body adapts and eventually gets used.  I also sometimes swayed, but now I do not feel any discomfort. </li><li>  placing a player in the cockpit or adding a static element such as a nose (according to the player polls, most of them did not notice him, and he didn‚Äôt interfere with them) or a sight.  This element allows the eye to cling to it and not get lost in space; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39e/023/de4/39e023de43204539af7c70d9ce14fe13.gif"><br>  <i><font color="b0b0b0">Nose in virtual reality taken <a href="http://www.pvsm.ru/igry/89368/print/">from here</a></font></i> </li></ul><br>  Then we thought what could be changed in the game itself.  We stopped at the following: <br>  The note about the nose seemed reasonable: your brain finds it difficult to center the image, since there is no reference point.  We solved this problem with a sight, which we added to the game.  Yes, it slightly reduces the realism of what is happening, but reduces the likelihood of discomfort. <br><br>  According to the tests, we realized that the main attacks occur when you turn too sharply, walk or fly.  Therefore, the speed of all actions was reduced by 40 percent. <br><br>  Of course, to completely overcome the nausea will not work, but we want to minimize it.  At the same time, we adhere to the position that toshnilovka in virtual reality is the norm.  When you go sailing in the sea, you understand that you may begin to feel sick?  This does not mean that the boat is bad.  The current level of technology does not allow us to eliminate this factor completely, so you will need to reckon with it just as with nausea when you go on a boat, nothing can be done. <br><br>  At the moment, bracelets are invented that feed electrical impulses into the body.  They give signals to the brain, imitating movement in space.  But judging by the feedback from VR users, this is still nothing more than a placebo. <br><br><h2>  VR club to beat expenses </h2><br>  As time went on, we had already closed the "Breaking Bad" quest, had already made repairs and were, in general, ready to open the quest.  But the quest itself was not ready for the desired date.  This created a million difficulties for us!  We stopped receiving revenue from the quest, which was closed.  We incurred monthly rental costs and employee wages.  And the end and edge of the development has not yet been seen.  It was necessary to look for a way out of the situation. <br><br>  And we thought that we have computers, we have oculus.  And there are already good games in the incentive and oculus side, in which people want to play.  We ourselves were delighted with the tutorial of the oculus, starting games, which are given as a gift.  I wanted to try other games myself. <br><br>  We moved all the equipment to the quest.  Office staff exhaled with relief, and Quest House administrators tensed :) <br><br>  From games on BP, through trial and error, we selected the most interesting ones for the game with the usual joystick: Obduction, Subnautica, Monstrum, The Solus Project, Boogeyman, Bazaar, Dead Secret, Project Cars, Gunjack, Deathlike, Kittypocaltpse, Dinofense, Destinations. <br><br>  The most interesting thing is that we personally received more BlazeRush races, which were played on four people and were not designed for BP at all, but were played in a cinema mode.  We only play in the "survival" mode, where your task is to stay alive, and the task of other players: to blow you up from a weapon or slow down.  A huge rink is rushing up behind you, which destroys the slowest participants. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here you will find the BlazeRush game trailer.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tCRFhj8gA0c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  But we digress! <br><br>  We started picking on.  Recently dug up a cool software: Vorpx.  Its essence is that it adapts non-VR games for VR.  So we launched GTA V, SKYRIM, Fallout 4, OUTLAST 2. Of course, the graphics are not as cool as in games that are sharpened for VR.  But playing GTA with glasses of virtual reality is well worth it.  Who has not dreamed of getting into a cool car and crashing into a cop at full speed?  When you play the game in the first person with glasses - these are very different impressions.  It is worth noting that Vorpx is not a program for commercial use. <br><br>  For advertising, we started shooting video reviews of games.  Here is <a href="https://vk.com/video-77493103_456239032">one example</a> . <br><br>  Another plus of the VR club is that people can come here as many times as they want, and not like in quests - 1 time has passed and you will not return again. <br><br>  The VR club eased our burden a little, but also suddenly created new problems.  Quest after the move stopped running if the monitor is not connected to the computer.  The office worked, and after the move began to demand a monitor!  This time the reason was never found, no matter how hard we tried. <br><br>  Therefore, we invented the "stub".  This is the usual VGA cable that imitated the included monitor.  The signal was analog; it was just energized.  But in the end, the Oculus was launched on a built-in video card on the motherboard, and not on a discrete one.  Suffered FPS graphics.  It was impossible to play. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/34b/f7a/520/34bf7a5209574539ac68dad07eb34159.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="b0b0b0">The first version of our stubs</font></i> <br><br>  Began to reinvent the wheel further and made a stub on the DVI-D port.  With it, the problem was solved, only a discrete video card participated.  If earlier, in order to switch from a virtual quest to a virtual club, it was necessary to pull out the stub and restart the computer, now this is not necessary. <br><br><h2>  Current situation, future plans. </h2><br>  As a result, 9 months have passed since the launch of the development of the virtual quest.  9 months of pain, joy and frustration.  The development period was overdue by 6 months. <br><br>  We have already passed a bunch of degrees of communication with developers: we quarreled with each other, threatened, put up, worked hand in hand.  They came to us, worked from Novosibirsk.  Now the project is closer than ever to completion.  A week, maybe two, and we will launch the first virtual quest in Novosibirsk. <br><br>  Now we are simultaneously working on opening the quest, searching for an investor, collecting our own development team and packaging.  And a rake, they are in any startup.  But for the first time, we experienced so many difficulties in one project! <br><br>  If you are still not enough, you can watch a video about our team <a href="https://kontur.ru/ib2017/3759">on the website of the contest ‚ÄúI am a Businessman - 2017‚Äù</a> .  It is also shot with our specific sense of humor, you will like it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322238/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322238/</a></p>
