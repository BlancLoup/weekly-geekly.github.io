As I said before, it was a bad idea, but at that time I did not know about it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The game has lain long enough for the HD prefix used in the iPad version to lose its original meaning, then it meant only that this is a version of the game for tablets, and there was no talk of any Retina.

      Using svaypov or tapas, your task is to keep the little animals in the air by inciting them like a ball and not letting them fall to the ground.  Also, you have to collect stars, which will help to open new animals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6fd/4b2/f76/6fd4b2f762c6bab1b5d104ca83226007.jpg"><br><br>  The game is available in <a href="http://www.gamesreality.com/arcade/236-petsballs.html">Flash</a> and <a href="http://beetleplay.com/pets_balls.html">iOS</a> versions. <br>  Flash, since this is my main platform at the time of writing the game, and even now, too, but in the near future, it seems, priorities will shift towards mobile platforms and Unity.  I really liked working with this engine. <br><br>  Android this time passed by  firstly, at that time I did not see Android as a platform under which I want to run games, and secondly, the mobile version was written in Objective-C using Cocos2D, which does not allow us to quickly and painlessly add a new platform. <br>  Although perhaps all is not lost, and the game still appears on the platform of the search giant.  Recently came across information about the Apportable SDK, with which it is possible to port a Cocos2D game on Android.  Link to the news <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/apportable-sdk-free-android-support-for-cocos2d-iphone/">here</a> .  In practice, there was still no opportunity to try, but the news is certainly interesting. <br>  Cocos2D was chosen because it has pretty good opportunities for 2D games and an excellent community, so all the problems that arose in the process of work were solved fairly quickly. <br><br>  For myself, I concluded that multiplatform engines and technologies are driving, and this must be taken into account at the beginning of development.  Even if now you do not plan to release the game on WP8, for example, then after a few months it may suddenly turn out to be one of the main platforms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/503/386/5f3/5033865f3f8996ed669166858df108bc.jpg"><br><br>  The graphics for this game painted my wife.  This is one of two attempts to attach it to my work.  The second game is still on the ‚Äúshelf‚Äù and waits for me to get there and finish it. <br>  Everything was drawn first on paper, then I photographed it and threw it into the Flash IDE, where my wife had already drawn it in color and with details.  After that, I translated the pictures into a raster and modified it in Photoshop using the dodge and burn tools, giving the animals a volume. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cab/1dd/8e1/cab1dd8e1633630992f804580390787a.gif"><br><br>  One of the main mistakes I made during development is the decision to make two separate versions for iPad and iPhone.  It seemed to me that there would be fewer problems with different sizes of graphics and coordinates of objects on the screen, but in the end, this resulted in a double work when adding something or fixing bugs. <br><br>  The game has simple gameplay and nice, cartoon graphics that I think children should like, but I hope that adults will also like the game. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvhmZ76q2-g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgFT68ae0JZ-xsWnCozz16gPrgYQg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It is available for free on the iPhone App Store: <br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pets-balls/id600633057%3Fmt%3D8">https://itunes.apple.com/app/pets-balls/id600633057?mt=8</a> <br>  and iPad: <br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pets-balls-hd/id600639352%3Fmt%3D8">https://itunes.apple.com/app/pets-balls-hd/id600639352?mt=8</a> <br><br>  Want to keep up to date and follow the BeetlePlay news? <br><br>  Subscribe to our blog on Habr√©, <br>  Join <a href="https://twitter.com/BeetlePlay">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BeetlePlay">Facebook</a> <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and see you soon! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186636/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186636/</a></p>
