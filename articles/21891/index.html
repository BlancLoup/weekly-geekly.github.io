  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Introduction to Linux</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>How it all began</b> <br>  It all started in 2005 (?) Year (one year after I got a computer) when I took a Ubuntu 5.10 disc from a classmate.  He, in turn, got him from a friend who received their ‚Äúpack for free‚Äù.  Then I didn‚Äôt know - didn‚Äôt know, hear - didn‚Äôt hear about some kind of Linux and used (played toys, of course!) Windows XP.  English was also bad (first in. Lang. - German), but everything in English on the box!  I looked at it for a long time (about two months) and finally decided that I should try. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Fortunately, by that time the experience of reinstalling Windows was already there and I was no longer afraid of these blue installation screens.  I beat the hard drive from under Windows.  booted from the installation CD, started the installation.  On the third attempt set.  I'm loading.  The loader is already beautiful, then - some strange sounds (greeting) and a brown desktop with brown window decorations.  So what to do next?  Where are my Windows content drives?  Where is my music?  As it turned out, he didn‚Äôt read NTFS partitions, he couldn‚Äôt play mp3, and in general it was somehow bad, everything was clear.  He began to study the method of scientific tyke.  The first thing you liked was the desktops, but I didn‚Äôt get used to it right away - why did they have so many of them (4 desktops)?  Then he began to try built-in toys.  And, actually, everything ‚Äî I found nothing more interesting.  From under Windows I went to the Internet (via GPRS - it was terribly expensive, but I still want to know what can be done with this Ubuntu) on the forums, read it and did not understand anything.  So a couple more months passed and my interest went out. <br><br>  Then I saw Uncle Linux on his home computer and again became interested in this OS.  I got 2-3 DVDs with software for Linux.  Joy knew no bounds - at last I can do something in Ubuntu (listen to mp3, watch video ...).  "Carefully" studied the installation instructions in English and started trying to install rpm on Ubuntu ... And I installed AmaroK.  It turned out (only how?) That Qt / KDE libraries are missing.  Then something else was not installed (not surprising ...).  At that time, I did not know about any divisions into the X system, the window manager, the graphics subsystem ... For me, Gnome, Nautilus and Ubuntu were one.  It was then that I cursed this very Gnome without knowing that it was just part of Linux. <br><br>  Later I asked Uncle "some normal Linux" :), and he gave me a few disks: Fedora Core, ASP Linux, and FreeBSD 6. Most of all I heard about Fedora and therefore I decided to install it first (I‚Äôve Naturally, I did not know anything yet).  There were only three disks and when installing the system from the second disk an error occurred and the installation was interrupted.  Fedora never went with me.  This was followed by ASP Linux in a scanned "corporate" cover with a Russian description.  The installation in the graphical mode went only from the third time, and after installing and entering the login and password everything hung tight.  Restarting and re-entering the data had the same effect.  ASP Linux also did not go.  The time has come for FreeBSD.  only a text installer in English scared me greatly, and when I had to mark the hard disk with fdisk handles ... I don‚Äôt remember how, but I put it!  As it turned out - without X'ov.  Actually, there was nothing to do and I returned to Ubuntu.  For another two or three months I suffered in search of the very ‚Äúnormal Linux‚Äù, and then again my interest waned.

      When I switched to another school, I saw a pack (about ten) of the same boxes with Ubuntu 5.10 on the teacher‚Äôs desk, and on the monitor, next to the teacher‚Äôs computer, ran a BSD text devil screensaver.  Then I began to ask the teachers about Linux, to which they replied that they themselves did not know anything, but our (non) malicious Admin was in charge of the whole thing.  The admin turned out to be really unfriendly and showed on the server (the same devilish one) the location of the iso-images distributed to school computers.  To the question ‚ÄúWhat would you advise me as a newbie?‚Äù I received an answer - ‚ÄúLike a teapot at all - Mandriva 2007. Burn a DVD - there‚Äôs more software.‚Äù <br><br>  So I recorded.  The installation went surprisingly smoothly in graphical mode.  And to the question that I want to use GNOME or KDE, I answered without hesitation KDE (remembering the good word of Gnome)!  And finally, I booted into a working system, which can ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù play my music, which it sees on NTFS sections (!), Clips and ... in fact, there was nothing more to do there.  Then I learned to put a different software, those rpm.  And AmaroK worked here with a bang!  Almost immediately I began to read the book ‚ÄúLinux for the user‚Äù by Viktor Kostromin and I learned and learned a lot of new things.  So Linux also tightened me ... But there was still nothing to do there - there were no games!  Then I started to learn HTML, PHP, and crawled from Windows to Linux, but not completely.  It turned out that this is really convenient: Vim + Desktops. <br><br>  Finally, in the fall (a year after I got acquainted with Mandriva), I upgraded from Mandriva 2007 Free to Mandriva 2008 PowerPack, which was written off from the same school server.  So I live with Mandriva 2008 and wait for new releases of this distribution. <br><br>  <a href="http://aid9990.blogspot.com/2008/03/blog-post_8438.html">From here</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21891/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21891/</a></p>
