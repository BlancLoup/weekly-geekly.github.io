  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electronic documentation in schools (ACS RNO)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Today, more and more enterprises, offices and small desktops are switching to electronic form of documentation.  Which in turn speeds up and at the same time simplifies the exchange of information, the preparation of reports of interest or the output of any other information. <br><br>  So the education went this way, or rather it was taken, obliging to use the RIS ACS program for delivery of reports.  ACS is a modified version of NetSchool that is configured for networking, and not in one particular school. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It so happened that I am the administrator of the ACS system.  So I decided to tell on Habr√©.  There are no references to this system, and I think it will be interesting to read and find out where our education is going. <br><br>  So, let's begin.  ACS RNO - Automated Resource Management System Education.  The server itself is located remotely and the system is managed through a web interface, which, from my point of view, is the right solution: firstly it simplifies system setup, as there is no need to set up servers in each individual school, secondly, it‚Äôs important for our education .  This is cost-effective again, and you don‚Äôt need to buy a huge number of servers, it‚Äôs enough just to connect the school to the Internet.

      Schools have distributed the IP server, which becomes the address to enter the system. <br>  Upon entering the system, we are met by an authorization panel in which user data is entered for entry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43c/d36/4a7/43cd364a78282ea726cfe4a8218f7cfc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is possible to choose an Educational Institution (OU), which is convenient both for mounting the system, and for self-reporting, without engaging the school administration, which also speeds up the workflow. <br><br>  Well, we have entered the future of our education (it‚Äôs considered so as time will tell) <br>  By default, we get to the board with ads, where teachers and the administration periodically post ads. <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/A8mdjkZf-fpc_Eb5-YJ48w%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0bc/f06/9fc/0bcf069fce161a295330b8f667d24027.jpg"></a> <br><br>  When creating ads, you can choose who will see it: everything, parents, teachers, children, head teachers, etc., is convenient for conveying information to a specific category of persons to whom it will be interesting. <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/ihK7gNsfaN7I_eSWKo_uUg%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfc/ed8/e69/dfced8e696f8b288a29fe6acca4add84.jpg"></a> <br><br>  You can also set the date of the automatic deletion of the advertisement after the loss of relevance. <br><br>  On the left side of the screen are tabs for navigating through sections of the system, consider from top to bottom: <br><br>  Internal mail analog Email, all the standard chose the address (you can group the students of the class, teachers, etc.), subject, text, attached if necessary, sent. <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/WrxAQW_Iy-38FhtPTtK8GQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/913/54f/1e2/91354f1e2a5a7b2f3c2623174e3d6c75.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Next is the same trivial forum: without pictures and without anonymity, which led to no popularity among children. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúSchool Manual‚Äù tab contains mainly ‚Äúmy‚Äù panels: these are the settings for access rights, time zones, the student‚Äôs curriculum lists, and the student movement log: <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/UckUerGSkWCxcvigjMMtHA%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd9/c2f/0c2/dd9c2f0c2e7020645f73fee0b1048878.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Lists of employees (students, parents) are sorted by several parameters: <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/aZBGdqN_RaMZrt28TcGPEQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/00a/9e2/b3b/00a9e2b3b5e82c9d03da006411f33451.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Adding people to the lists is possible both through the web interface and the import method from both .csv and 1C: Chronograph School, which significantly speeds up the work. <br><br>  The documents tab contains standard government regulations, acts + additional school documents (for example, sample applications for parents). <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/2V6kOsGUotJqq10KRswyTQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a7/767/006/3a7767006a1614051dd11d40b4fa06f0.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Classes and subjects are information about the subjects taught in specific classes, the division into subgroups, etc. <br><br>  Lesson Planning ‚Äùcontains tools for creating and storing calendar-thematic plans for subjects and ready plans approved by the Ministry of Education. <br><br>  Training materials create tests, assignments and then perform their children at home, the answers are automatically processed on a given rating scale and are rated. <br><br>  The tab of the schedule in it is viewing, and editing the schedule itself. <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/3KMP-00KdSZcoeujLiVTow%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb4/e81/4f6/cb4e814f68b045ad180983c5e453eed3.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Here the creation of the schedule by the developers failed; this process was very laborious both in time and in non-informativeness (too many unnecessary operations for full editing).  It is necessary to drive a single subject of one class separately, when it was possible to implement, for example, the complete table of the week class.  True, there is an opportunity to import from specialized programs Chronograph 3.0, VTOR-2004, Rector 3.22, but due to the absence of this software in our school, I will not say anything about this method. <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/9AAX47BZmH5af09TT9Qq3Q%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f9e/c4c/e15/f9ec4ce15684f796948924b8d06f305e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Cool magazine is one of the main points of the system.  Here you can enter grades, attendance, homework. <br><br>  Entering ratings: <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/kBPAfpg0lujC4ikTys4j4g%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa1/cf2/cca/aa1cf2ccaa2ab02411f1bf4ca61dd45d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Reports, the second main component of the system - the use of generated data in generating reports for all interested parties from parents to the Ministry of Education of the region - contains a huge number of reports that were previously typed manually now are made in a few clicks. <br><br>  In addition to ready-made reports, there is a ‚Äúreport designer‚Äù in which you can create specific reports that are not included in the standard set. <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/6KK1bK-cYI4PoVxUwB0h7A%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b8a/436/c23/b8a436c23bf4ff21fa9c4da3c1a3c2cc.jpg"></a> <br><br>  School resources are a directory of additional links (for example, to the school website, educational sites) and the portfolio of the user or his projects. <br><br>  Well, finally, personal settings where we can change the password, the first page at the entrance and change the design (changes the text tabs on the icons). <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/L7o94iJ3kDSHyKUChK9jaw%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d27/e1f/34c/d27e1f34c794dd3fe056af9f10464a6f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  It is worth adding that I considered the system with admin rights, for teachers some of the items will be closed.  For parents and students, a special look is made where items directly related to their child are available.  All other children will not be seen by parents. <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/hQ4wzMUbVX1f7aoaPuGXug%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/253/031/b55/253031b55a95392ded4c44f5bd353835.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Here, in principle, the entire ACS system, which we have already introduced in the oblast for the 2nd year, of course, has positive aspects of innovation: speeding up the workflow, simplifying parents' communication with the school (forum, post), simplifying control of progress and attendance;  but it was not without its drawbacks, not always the well-functioning work of the program, not the possibility of an alternative solution of the problem - only one way and not always optimal.  Well, the main enemy of all these efforts is the attitude of the authorities.  The system was introduced - introduced, started to be checked - started, and for successful development nothing is done.  Additional work is not paid to teachers - only at the discretion of the director from the supplementary funds, the age of the teachers also makes itself felt: 2/3 teachers of teachers are over 50 and not all with a computer for ‚Äúyou‚Äù.  Some of them are also on ‚Äúsorry, I can try,‚Äù which also makes it difficult to timely enter data into the database. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111327/</a></p>
