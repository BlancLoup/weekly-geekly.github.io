While full-scale Transformers seem somewhat unrealistic - and impractical - it turns out there are robots that have a lot in common with Transformers.  In this article, we will look at how these robots look, how they work, and what is their similarity to Transformers like Optimus Prime. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Let's start with the analysis of Optimus Prime.  It is huge and impressive, but can it exist in reality?  To find the answer to this question, we asked engineer Michael D. Belote (Michael D. Belote), what would be required to create a full-scale multi-ton truck that can transform into a two-legged robot.  In other words, what would it take to create a real Optimus Prime? <br><br>  First and foremost, Prime should be a self-rebuilding robot.  Self-tuning robots, or robots that can change their shape in accordance with the tasks performed, exist today.  However, they are very different from Optimus Prime.  As Michael Belote explains: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      ‚ÄúWhen creating self-tuning robots, engineers generally prefer to make separate, mobile modules small, inexpensive and easily replaceable;  however, in the case of Optimus Prime, we are dealing with a robot, whose individual modules are as large as the semi-trailer cab.  Even if the construction of such modules would be possible, the price of the issue would be enormous, and the exceptional complexity would make it almost impossible to achieve that all parts of the system work harmoniously. ‚Äù <br><br>  Even if engineers figured out how to make self-tuning modules on the Optimus Prime scale, supplying them with energy for movement would remain impossible.  In the form of a car, Optimus Prime can operate from conventional diesel fuel.  But walking is much more difficult than rolling on wheels!  To walk, Prime needs a lot more energy than a diesel engine can provide.  Then we give Belote's analysis on how to cope with the requirements of Prime in the matter of obtaining the necessary energy: <br><br>  ‚ÄúTraditionally, robots use one of three energy resources: electric, pneumatic, hydraulic.  Taking into account the enormous weight of the Prime, the most likely energy resource for it is hydraulic, as hydraulic actuators provide a very high energy to weight ratio (a large amount of output energy at low input energy costs). ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/dc5/6b0/3be/dc56b03beefeffb30b53fdb1cb81a17c.jpg" width="384" height="450" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  So, hydraulic energy can allow Prime to walk, but creates a number of additional problems on its own.  ‚ÄúA tank or reservoir for storing hydraulics should be added,‚Äù says Belote, ‚Äúhydraulic pumps are needed, they need a second power source to actuate, and valves to maintain the right pressure and flow.  In addition to this, Prime hydraulically powered would have to be lined with pipes for transferring hydraulic fluid.  These pipes, as well as fuel tanks and electrical wiring, would have to remain intact, or even intact, during transformation. <br><br>  Having safely transformed the transformation into a robot shape, Prime then has to walk on two legs.  Belote describes what is needed for this to happen: since most often the weight of semi-trailers reaches 30 tons, the weight of Prime can easily reach 35-40 tons.  Comparing it with <a href="http://dvice.ru/blogs/r2d2/12">Honda's ASIMO robot, the</a> world's best ‚Äúwalking‚Äù <a href="http://dvice.ru/blogs/r2d2/12">robot</a> , which weighs 54 kilograms and at the same time can walk no more than 40 minutes (on electricity) at a speed of less than 3 km per hour.  The weight ratio of ASIMO is 1.04 kilograms per inch, compared to the weight ratio of Prime, which would reach 30 - 36 kilograms per inch, that is, 30 times more. <br><br>  In addition, robots can not easily make movements while walking.  ‚ÄúIn the case of the robot,‚Äù says Belote, ‚Äúthere is a specific team (raise the leg by the‚Äú x ‚Äùvalue, move the body forward by the‚Äú y ‚Äùvalue, stretch the foot down by the‚Äú z ‚Äùvalue, and so on).  People do not have a ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù mechanism - your brain doesn‚Äôt constantly contact your feet on where to put them.  Instead, you just lean forward and ‚Äúfall,‚Äù putting your foot to soften the blow when your foot touches the floor. ‚Äù <br><br>  Thus, we are unlikely to be able to see a functioning Optimus Prime or some other robot of the same type in our time.  In reality, there are many different tunable robots that can perform up to several different tasks.  For example, a research all-terrain vehicle for Mars can generate solar energy and store it in batteries, drill stones, take pictures, drive, use spectrometers to record temperature, chemical compounds, infrared rays and alpha particles, send the data to Earth.  This, of course, is very different from the abilities of Transformers, which can take two forms with strikingly different strengths and capabilities, which makes them so exciting. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://dvice.ru/blogs/r2d2/17">dvice.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24670/</a></p>
