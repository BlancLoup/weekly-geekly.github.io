At the same time, we always try to meet the suggestions and wishes of our users.  Starting today, we are launching a complex of services for administering Linux servers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is designed for those who already use the services of "Dedicated Server", "Server Location", "Virtual Linux-server", "Cloud Server" and "Server Cabinet". <br><br>  New services will help you to ensure uninterrupted operation of equipment, as well as save time (and in some cases - very substantial sums of money) for diagnostics and troubleshooting.

      <br>
      The new service package includes: <br><ul><li>  basic diagnostics; </li><li>  transfer of client projects to our infrastructure; </li><li>  hourly administration. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Basic diagnostics </h2><br>  If there are any problems or problems with availability on your server, you can send us a request for basic diagnostics via the ticket system, and we will help you identify their causes.  The request should describe the existing problem and specify the access to the server. <br><br>  Analyzing client requests, we see that very often our users cannot figure out on which side the problem arose, what causes it and how to fix it.  Previously, we did not provide any assistance to our clients and eliminated only faults on our side.  Now we help you diagnose the causes of all problems and problems for free. <br><br>  The diagnostic procedure is free if it takes no more than 15 minutes.  If during this time we can find out exactly what the problem is, we will send you a detailed report and suggestions on how to solve it through the ticket system.  All further work is performed by us as part of hourly administration (see below). <br><br>  If it takes more than 15 minutes to diagnose and troubleshoot, we will send you a message asking you to perform all the relevant work on a paid basis as part of the hourly administration. <br><br><h2>  Transfer client projects </h2><br>  Migrating from one server to another is quite troublesome, time consuming and in many cases requiring highly skilled system administrator.  For a serious web project, any, even the smallest error during data migration can turn into very serious losses. <br><br>  If your project is hosted on the basis of third-party infrastructure and you want to become our client, we will help you transfer all data to you quickly and, most importantly, completely free of charge.  To do this, you will need to send us a request through the ticket system, provide full access to the project and show its working version.  Data transfer is carried out in up to 3 days depending on the complexity of the project.  All conditions are negotiated individually. <br><br>  Data transfer is carried out free of charge only for new customers (ie, those who contact us for the first time).  For those who already use our services, the transfer is carried out within the framework of hourly administration. <br><br><h2>  Hourly system administration </h2><br>  As part of the ‚ÄúHourly System Administration‚Äù service, we offer you assistance from highly qualified system administrators in diagnosing and resolving serious problems (restoring the OS, file system, etc.), as well as installing and configuring additional software on the server. <br><br>  If any complex problems occur on the server, the reasons for which you cannot install by yourself, you just need to send us a request through the ticket system.  We will calculate the time it takes to carry out the necessary work, and invoice you.  Troubleshooting work will be initiated upon receipt of payment. <br><br>  Additional work that goes beyond the standard technical support, we produce on the basis of technical specifications.  The interaction in this case is carried out according to the following scheme: <br><ul><li>  You send us a detailed technical task (TZ) with a list of all the necessary work; </li><li>  we analyze the TZ, assess the possibility of its implementation, clarify with you all the details and nuances; </li><li>  after the final approval of the TZ with you, we will notify the date of its implementation and issue an invoice for payment; </li><li>  After confirming payment, we proceed to work. </li></ul><br><br>  At your request, we can help you create a TK from scratch or refine an existing TK. <br><br>  The cost of the ‚ÄúHourly System Administration‚Äù service is: <br><ul><li>  1500 rubles per hour if the service is provided on weekdays from 10 am to 7 pm Moscow time; </li><li>  3000 rubles per hour, if the service is provided during non-working hours by prior agreement through the ticket system; </li><li>  4500 rubles per hour, if the work is performed in urgent mode. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Feedback </h2><br>  We are just starting to provide server administration services.  To develop a strategy for their further improvement and development, we definitely need to get feedback from our users.  We welcome any comments, suggestions and suggestions for improving the new package of services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228547/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228547/</a></p>
