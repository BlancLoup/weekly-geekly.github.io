  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Simplify your life with a service that combines services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I want to share with you one cool service that I noticed for myself a year ago, but still could not find the time to register and get it to work for me.  And now, when Google Reader was closed, and my favorite extension for reading RSS feeds began to fail, I decided to start optimizing the path of interesting articles from blogs to my tablet.  And I will do it with the help of the <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> service.  At once I will state that in this article everything will be very obvious and simple, its meaning is to show how you can simplify your life with a service that combines services.  <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/109352">The result</a> will be a simple recipe. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb0/66c/e24/eb066ce24483f6cc3fd36e949454282f.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  About.  what is IFTTT </h5><br><br>  Services is awesome.  Almost every solid site offers to use a part of itself automatically: save notes in Evernote, write tweets on Twitter, get fresh posts of your favorite blog - not only people can do this through the interface of the corresponding site, but also the program through the API.  But only here is the problem: we have the Evernote API and Twitter API, but for tweets to be automatically saved as notes, we need to write a program, debug it, run every N minutes and constantly maintain it.  So it was before.  Now all the dirty work will be done for you by the service that combines the services, and you specify your intention in almost human language: ‚ÄúIf a new tweet, then create a new note in Evernote with its contents‚Äù

    <h5>  ‚ÄúIf Google Reader closed, then I switch to IFTTT‚Äù </h5><br><br>  How did I read Habr before?  Articles are aggregated in the RSS reader of the browser, every morning I open it, delete uninteresting articles and send to Pocket (Read it Later) interesting ones.  But it so happened that in the summer I was away, without access to my home PC, but with a tablet, but I was too lazy to remember the addresses of the news feeds and enter them into some kind of tablet RSS reader.  When I arrived home a few weeks later, I realized that I was not only too lazy to rake all this pile of news, I didn‚Äôt save the lion‚Äôs share, since no one had started it during these weeks. <br><br>  I did not want to get attached to one of the Google Reader clones - because of the fear that the fate of their older brother could all befall them, and I also wanted to receive news in a familiar place, the client of which is on almost every form.  This, of course, about Evernote.  IFTTT was chosen as a layer, as the service still looks quite alive, supports a bunch of other services that can be useful in organizing news reading (the same Pocket, for example), and has a simple interface. <br><br><h5>  Example </h5><br><br>  Now we will start receiving posts from Habra in a notebook prepared for this case in Evernote with a few clicks. <br><br>  1. We register on <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> , connect your Evernote account. <br><br>  2. Click on the big button Create a Recipe. <br><br>  From this moment I ask all those who are responsible for the GUI of web projects to pay attention to the interface.  He is very good: minimalist and complete, simple and clear.  Here, of course, the lion's share of subjectivity, but I want sites like Facebook to like me as much as this. <br><br>  3. Feel free to click on this.  Now we have to choose one of the channels, which will be the trigger of our condition.  In our case, this is a Feed - because it is the appearance of news in RSS that is the reason for creating a note. <br><br>  4. Now we will specify which of the triggers of the selected channel interests us.  If, for example, you want to receive only those news that mentions Android, choose ‚ÄúNew feed item matches‚Äù.  I want to get everything, so I chose "New feed item" <br><br>  5. We specify our trigger by specifying fields.  In our case, this is only one field in which you need to specify the URL of the feed of interest.  I think many people are interested in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/rss/best/">http://habrahabr.ru/rss/best/</a> , so we‚Äôll point this out. <br><br>  6. Great, with the trigger finished, now the second half of the work is action.  This time we select Evernote and, if we want to immediately receive the news before kat, ‚ÄúCreate a note‚Äù. <br><br>  7. It remains to set the parameters of the created note.  Here the possibilities are very wide, because you can use keywords like "{{EntryContent}}".  Basic restrictions: a notebook with the specified name must be created in advance and there must not be Cyrillic in its name. <br>  There is also an ambiguous moment with where to indicate the name of the tape - in a notebook or in a tag.  In the second case, a notepad can be something common like ‚ÄúSubscriptions‚Äù.  Here, everyone decides for himself, but, given the limited depth of the hierarchy of Evernote notebooks (only 2), I still advise you to manage with tags wherever they can replace notebooks. <br><br>  8. That's all, the recipe is created.  Now the service will periodically check the tape and create us notes.  We can force a check with the button "Check" <br><br>  Now we can filter the news feed in any convenient place on any device where there is Evernote.  And nothing will leave us due to the fact that we have not updated the ribbon in the browser for a long time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188896/</a></p>
