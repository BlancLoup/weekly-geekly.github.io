  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is it Opera Unite?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Tired of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/opera/62208/">me here in response to many</a> to write the same comment, and did not get an answer already, so I write a topic. <br><br>  Opera Unite is NOT FOR THOSE who can configure DNS, uPNP, for whom ifconfig is their home, and file_get_contents is terrible vulgarity, it is for people for whom even the word ‚Äúrouter‚Äù sounds like they are trying to hurt them.  Opera gave these people the opportunity not to depend on Flickr by posting their photos on the network themselves, the opportunity for small entrepreneurs to upload their static website made in Word (saved as html) to the network, as well as to professionals, the possibility is more simple (due to zero-configuration) write small personal services for yourself or prototype applications.  Easy exchange of messaging documents, etc. <br><br>  The point is that Opera Unite is a tool for beginners. <br>  And for the pros, this is either the option to write small personal applications (personal billing for example, which takes 5 minutes a day). <a name="habracut"></a>

      This is an intranet system where everyone in the office can share documents and transfer to others. <br><br>  Here in this p2p Web is - no one else is tied to serious technologies that require configuration (httpd.conf / my.cnf / nginx.conf / vsftpd.conf / ... how much more is needed). <br><br>  This does not mean that suddenly nginx / apache / php / mysql / django is not needed by anyone - they are needed the same way, only now that segment that could not use it can. <br><br>  SketchUp did not cancel 3DSMAX but gave architects, carpenters and designers a simple 3D tool that they couldn‚Äôt do because of the seriousness of Max and Maya.  Maxers and Maytsa have not gone away, but now a lot of people who do not specialize in 3D can work on 3D. <br><br>  Opera Unite (constantly pulling Opera Native to write) does what SketchUp does for 3D!  Expands the base of people who can participate in it. <br><br>  You view the web only from the perspective of applications that are needed by thousands of people every day.  Those.  Google Docs, and in fact there is an OpenOffice Writer (well, well, Word), which turned on and off when not necessary.  The presence of Google Docs does not cancel the existence of the Word? <br><br>  We only scratch the surface about what Opera United is, but soon there will be a lot of small applications that everyone can run as much as they need (he and his friends). <br><br>  For everything else, the root-cloud-jail-vp-ftp-s3-nginx-php-django-apache-java-c ++ servers will remain - arc3. <br><br>  Just understand that this is a completely new class of programs, they cannot be compared to old stereotypes.  It is like the appearance of sites in the era of punched cards.  Why do we need websites if there are large computers that can count? <br><br>  ‚ÄúHow can the site model the movement of the galaxy?‚Äù A scientist of that time asked. <br><br>  Here you have the same question: ‚ÄúIf I can raise the site myself - why do I need Opera Unite?‚Äù <br><br>  The tasks are different.  Opera Unite is not really sites.  We still do not really know what we can do at Opera United, but the fact that these are ‚Äúalmost sites‚Äù, but still ‚Äúnot quite sites‚Äù is already obvious. <br><br>  Just now Opera - well done, made analogs of web applications, so that people saw something familiar, and then - go ahead - fantasize, we even gave you HTML5.  It remains for us to give the support of the .dll so that all Python and SQLite can be connected and this will be a bomb.  And already - this is a very serious leap forward. <br><br>  Initially it seemed to me that this was another trick: ‚ÄúWe will re-invent the Web‚Äù and release Opera 11 with supporting gestures with a face ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DkkNxbyp6thM">except for jokes, by the way</a> ), but it turned out to be something really revolutionary. <br><br>  But we still do not understand this full potential.  It took the society more than 10 years to begin to fully understand Python, and you want to understand a fundamentally new technology in half a day. <br><br>  Yes, there were plug-ins that built the web server into the browser, but none of them did .... operaunite.com, and they expected you to set up your router and DNS yourself, and give you localhost.  The problem is that those who are able to do this - they don‚Äôt want to have a server in their browser, it‚Äôs easier for them to start a real service. <br><br>  And there are still 95% of people who have no idea what a CNAME record is - so they can get a giant advantage now. <br><br>  There are also offices that pay huge money for developing GUI software, which they specifically for them makes the documents with one button.  But why, if it is possible to do the same right in the browser ‚Äî which is still-and-the-server?  (Maybe this is not very possible right now, but already very close) <br><br>  Another example.  Photographers have long learned how to make digital photos, but before the advent of Flickr - it was hard to upload your portfolio to the Internet - you need to hire a pro, make a website.  Flickr comes and gives all photographers a place and the opportunity to post pictures. <br><br>  Opera Unite does the same, only now everyone can develop their own something in 20 lines of JavaScript.  It will not be available 24 hours, but it will be enough that he showed it to someone and they discussed it. <br><br>  Available 24 hours is thinking in terms of the ‚Äúsite‚Äù category as in the words ‚ÄúGoogle Docs‚Äù, and Opera Unite needs the ‚Äúsite-how-LOCAL-service‚Äù (SAALS?) Thinking - as in the words ‚ÄúMicrosoft Word‚Äù, which (thinking) , unfortunately, so far "under construction". <br><br>  But it will evolve.  Or it will not develop - it depends only on whether a critical mass of followers will now appear, which will draw everyone.  The chances of this, I would say, are high.  I will add my paw to this and, as far as possible, I will help everyone who wants (I find everything that I put on <a href="http://unitehowto.com/">Unite HowTo</a> ). <br><br>  <i>Here you have one of the simplest ideas how to combine the old thinking and the new.</i>  <i>Make an indexer of people who are online now and openly share music.</i>  <i>A la torrentz.com just for music.</i>  <i>Here you have a reliable and affordable 24 hour website, which is based on unreliable technology (unreliable in the sense that the browser can always be turned off even by accident).</i>  <i>So you invented distributed last.fm.</i>  <i>Something that used to be almost impossible to do.</i> <br><br>  I'm not saying that this is the best idea in the world (most likely, in the last 10 years from the end), but this ‚Äúnew‚Äù thinking is just beginning to form and <i>we</i> will form it <i>with you</i> .  But one time the web froze.  Everyone began to make social networks.  And suddenly the web has seriously moved, there are absolutely new possibilities.  For software, for sites, for their <i>mixing</i> . <br><br>  I‚Äôm even hard to imagine, but I think that the possibilities for creating games (let's play sea battle?), Virtual worlds (go to my tavern, which I draw in SketchUp, only <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/o3d/">O3D can</a> be put), distributed social networks, ultra-local services (dating site district, newspaper at home, entrance message board).  And why is all this possible?  Low learning curve (compared to DNS / PHP / SQL), almost zero costs, drag-n-drop everywhere. <br><br>  <i>Another idea (for level designers in games, for example)</i> : Collective mapping.  I run, let's say, the application on my computer and call a couple of friends with me to put together a map for Crysis, I model the map, but this time I receive messages from the Opera: ‚ÄúPut a palm tree here‚Äù, ‚ÄúHere they will break my head‚Äù.  And the essence is almost simple - some kind of program goes screencasting, for example, screenshots are taken once a second and laid out on the site, people comment where something is wrong - and I can see where I messed up on specific screens directly and where idea and pass for yours.  No server, nothing else, except Opera Unite. <br><br>  <i>Another idea (for advanced programmers)</i> : Large distributed hash table.  We spread the file, it is cut into pieces and, together with MD5, is stored on other computers that are currently connected to the network with auto-replication, instead it stores other people's pieces.  I'm not saying that this cannot be done now (this has already been done many times), but done with automatic configuration of incoming connections and almost completely decentralized with <i>standard browser tools and JavaScript!</i>  A central server in fact can only be a mini-tracker, tracking only the URLs of connected browsers.  After all, in fact, no one bothers one Opera to connect with another.  (although anyone can get in the way, some cross-site policy, we still have to figure out how much they ‚Äúserver‚Äù -side javascript gave freedom) <br><br>  And so on.  Ideas for the sea - both for beginners and for very advanced users, but for now we should at least study the underlying technology. <br><br>  Before drawing "Mona Lisa" you need to at least learn how to draw Malevich‚Äôs square. <br><br>  Go, Opera, I love you again! <br><br>  PS I am very glad that my post clarifies for many the power of the impending revolution, although it seemed to me all to be self-evident. <br><br>  Here are the comments that are very worth reading: <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/opera/62233/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/opera/62233/">2</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/opera/62233/">3</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/opera/62233/">4</a> .</b> <br><br>  PPS But with the name Opera miscalculated, only today I saw Uni <b>te</b> as it is called Uni <b>T</b> , Unit <b>ED</b> , Unit <b>Y</b> , and I automatically try to call it Native (because of Google <b>Native</b> (~ Unite) Client). <br><br>  PPPS Do I work for Opera?  (Doubt expressed) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/opera/62233/">answer</a> .  By the way, comrade, who expressed doubts - do not minus, right, you should always doubt. <br><br><img src="http://habrahabr.ru/media/userpic/avatar/14/45/58/31055.png"><br>  Yoi Haji <br>  <a href="http://yoihj.habrahabr.ru/blog/">view from Habra</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62233/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62233/</a></p>
