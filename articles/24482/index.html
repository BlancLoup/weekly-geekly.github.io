  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúI do not want to work for my uncle!‚Äù - the reverse side of the medal</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I have been reading many posts on Habr√© about how great it is to have your own business and free yourself from getting up at 5 am daily, a two-hour train ride to work, an eight-hour ‚Äúmonkey labor‚Äù and an evening reflow.  And all this, five days a week all year round. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I am outraged by the fact that the authors of these notes take two extreme examples: terrible, slavish, uninteresting, unpromising work for an uncle and charming, giving, freedom and independence, successful, own business.  But this is all far from reality.

      <br>
      I want to share a bit of thoughts from that very freedom and independence, for the sake of which, in fact, everything begins, and which most attracts young businessmen. <br><br>  Suppose you have become skilled in some field, be it programming, design or SEO, no matter what, but you have become a professional.  Suppose even that you have some product or some thought that (in your opinion) can turn the target market.  In your dreams, you already bathe in money, everyone expresses their respect to you, you work as much as you want. <br><br>  But reality beats immediately and hurts.  The first thing to face is money.  And, if you do not have them at your disposal, then freedom and independence will end immediately.  Because working with an investor is not much different from working for an uncle.  We will have to defend the business plan and budget and convince people who are risking their money that it will burn out.  Moreover, in the case of receipt, financing may stop at any time for many reasons.  In other matters, there is also a loan - a direct road to sleepless nights. <br><br>  Then there will be a lot of organizational and legal issues that are also not very pleasant to deal with, and they will require a lot of time.  (taking into account our developed bureaucracy and numerous programs of ‚Äúsupporting small business‚Äù). <br><br>  If in the company that you organize will be employees, then this is again a difficulty.  I do not think that those who read this text believe that fanaticism is useful for the workflow, and people who write code as maniacs sitting at the computer for 12 hours are exactly those who are needed to achieve success.  After all, these are dangerous people who can ‚Äúburn out‚Äù at any moment.  By the same token, a person who is not interested in anything other than his trade union quickly falls ill with "professional criticism."  His field of knowledge simply narrows to the subject of his work.  But how much knowledge, indirectly related to work, can be obtained from life.  This is all to the fact that your employees, in addition to your awesome project, will also be concerned about salary, social package, convenience of the workplace and other nonsense, which for you as a carrier of the idea does not matter. <br><br>  And we almost got to the most important.  Around you will always be a carousel of customers, customers, subcontractors, consultants, colleagues, employees.  All will constantly do something and say.  The amount of information that you will receive will become colossal.  And with all this, you will have to constantly make decisions yourself.  They will be true and wrong.  Optimal and goofy. <br><br>  And the fact that you are the ‚Äúfounder of the company‚Äù or that you ‚Äúrisk money‚Äù does not give you immunity or super-abilities to make only the right decisions. <br><br>  And there will be no time to think for weeks what to do or how to do better.  Answers will often be needed here and now.  And for each decision it will be necessary to bear responsibility before yourself and the team. <br><br>  The result of the work will not always be "fucked."  Sometimes, Ushat Pomoi will be poured on his head, and first of all those who think that their business is cool, free and independent, and has no idea that this is actually hellish work.  And it will be hard and painful to hit on ambitions.  After all, you wanted the best, you wanted everyone to like it.  I invested a lot of time and effort into it.  And some suckers, who did not smell powder, wrote to you, ‚ÄúYou are a freak, and your work is a sad shit!‚Äù <br><br>  When there are so many circumstances around you, your life becomes exactly the same.  We will rise at 5, letters, calls, meetings, problems, solutions until 12 at night, but there is no weekend.  Not one ... A phone call can thwart all nonworking plans.  Here it is such a result of freedom and independence of the entrepreneur. <br><br>  And in this all will always have to control emotions and think soberly and unconventionally.  Summarizing, I can say that it is this (and, naturally, the ability to make quick decisions) and make a person a successful entrepreneur, and not at all knowledge of the subject area (although this is a very big plus). <br><br>  And Vel, in fact, you can do what you like and quietly receive a salary, just working for your uncle.  Well, or doing freelancing. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : So that you understand me correctly, I am an entrepreneur :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24482/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24482/</a></p>
