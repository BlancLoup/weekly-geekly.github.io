  <section class="page js-page"><h1>KeyWeb - I resent!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello dear Habrahabr community! <br>  I want to share with you how important it is to choose a reliable hosting partner and how it is conditionally important when the Hosting Company is serious and qualified. <br>  I'll start, perhaps from far away <a name="habracut"></a><br>  About a year and a half ago I had an urgent need for a dedicated server.  At the leading companies they stand very well, meaning if the piece of iron is good, there‚Äôs no point in taking junk.  And then I got a certain KeyWeb.De desk.  Later they are also (http://KeyWeb.Ru).  I think that no one will argue that prices for this company are very democratic, payment is possible in web money, in general, everything is fine.  More precisely, almost everything.  The weakest point of this company is customer relations. <br><br><h5>  Customer is always NOT right </h5><br>  One fine day, someone X came to the support of a Kay Web with an abusa and said "he stole my design."  Without proof, without everything, I just wrote a letter and said that your client is a thief.  What does KeyVeb do?  Caveb, creates a new message in the ticket system <br><br><blockquote>  Good day.  A complaint was received on your server.  We ask you to take urgent measures to stop this activity. <br>  If no action is taken within 24 hours, your server will be blocked. </blockquote>  Next comes the gist of the complaint. <br>  A hoster without trial, without everything at once, automatically put me to blame for the situation. <br>  For all questions "is the hosting company KeyVeb and its representative Sasha B (I don‚Äôt write a normal name on purpose because they can make an account, sorry dear) - I received silence by experts in the field of web design.  The hosting company and representative Sasha B considered themselves the right to decide what the original is and what a copy is.  All questions are never given clear answers. <br>  The hosting company KeyVeb will ignore you any day for almost 24 hours - at night no one will question so precisely, for any action, whether it is a CME for 5 hours, although you really need 20 minutes, or moving the OS - 25 euros.  Is always.  I sincerely regret that I recommended this company to people (I recommended honestly myself - without affiliate programs). <br>  I always paid for services in VME, but then it became too lazy to convert, and I asked to change the currency of merchata to VSW.  Ok, changed.  And I did not notice how I began to overpay for a place of 99 euros, for 116 euros.  It became annoying, they say how so, why not warned about it?  I appeal to the accounting department - I say, dear, how is that?  I get a brilliant answer: <br><blockquote>  The internal rate of the company wmz / ‚Ç¨ is 1.57, it is associated with additional costs for receiving and processing payments in webmoney.  It may be more profitable for you to pay in wme, the rate for which is 1.05 </blockquote><br>  That is, we consider 16 * 12 = 192 euros per year from the air from one client.  Cool.  What is the company's internal course?  What a brain zapping - converting to web mani happens one course at any point on the planet!  And here are just such things, unfortunately they admit very, very much.  They just do not care about the client.  The client is such a bastard that spoils the valiant managers and caliper life.  I will not say anything about how well they ‚Äúforget‚Äù to put something into the server, they really like less memory and insert screws.

    <h5>  A brief conclusion I would like to make and give a little advice. </h5><br>  The company has only two opinions of them and not the right one.  The client is always a priori wrong. <br>  If someone uses the services of this company - run from there, the further the better. <br>  If someone was going to use their services - in no case do not even think about it!  The miser pays twice, and the fool thrice, and I paid apparently 5 times more than both. <br>  PS I am looking for a new home for my projects, please advise a good dedic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88799/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88799/</a></p>
