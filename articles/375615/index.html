Part Two - Software</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/244751/">In a previous post on Habr√©,</a> we briefly talked about what an <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/proj-education-interactive/">Epson interactive projector is</a> , and what technologies actually provide its ‚Äúinteractivity‚Äù. <br><br>  In this post, we will show exactly how you can use such projectors in education and business to increase the effectiveness of lessons, seminars and presentations, and also describe the software built into the projectors. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ed/241/ea1/6ed241ea192b4e33904c195089bd5c32.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Interactive presentations and lessons </h2><br>  What is special about interactive presentation?  Of course, the fact that the interactive presentation allows you to interact with the elements on the screen.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d5/8d9/df7/3d58d9df7e994576a4d112e37af59bb3.jpg"></div><br>  Due to the fact that Epson interactive projectors can interact with a PC ‚Äúon the right‚Äù of a conventional computer mouse, any educational multimedia discs that can be found in abundance on store shelves can be turned into visual interactive learning aids containing many interactive elements, including even tests: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2dd/9a9/2eb/2dd9a92eb6e84f61957df47211412b19.jpg"></div><br>  For the teacher, this is a great way to uncover the possibilities of interactive equipment. <br><br><h2>  Create online courses and presentations </h2><br>  What to do if you want to <b>create such courses yourself?</b> <br><br>  To do this, there are programs for creating interactive lessons, such as <a href="http://easiteach.com/eng/">Easiteach Next Generation</a> , <a href="http://education.smarttech.com/en/products/notebook">SMART Notebook</a> and many others.  Being built on the same basic principles as PowerPoint, these programs are sharpened for use with interactive equipment and allow you to add various elements to the presentation that you can interact with.  A canonical example is the electronic ruler: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ed/241/ea1/6ed241ea192b4e33904c195089bd5c32.jpg"></div><br>  What, in particular, is the program Easiteach is notable for the clear separation of the stages of creating a lesson and its presentation.  The picture above shows that the creator of the lesson decided to limit the tools available on each slide only to what is needed to solve a specific task.  Thus, the interactive lesson looks high quality and professional. <br><br>  Interactive presentations and lessons are just one of the ways to use an interactive projector with a computer.  The only limitation is your imagination - any application with mouse or touch support can be used with an interactive projector. <br><br><h2>  Handwritten notes anywhere on the screen </h2><br>  If it was possible to pick up a marker and go to the image, then it is a sin not to write or draw something.  Adding annotations over various materials is one of the most requested features of an interactive projector. <br><br>  Add notes and save them inside the document allow, for example, applications MS Word, Excel and PowerPoint.  The latter allows you to do this right during the slide show: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52f/035/a72/52f035a727a54eb4a68f9c185b189ebe.jpg"></div><br>  And if you need the ability to add notes on top of any material projected on the screen, this will allow you to make a free program <a href="http://epson.ru/support/software/software-projectors/">Epson Easy Interactive Tools</a> , created specifically for Epson interactive projectors.  In the picture below you can see that we have written above all applications and are capturing the screen: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b37/5d2/1e0/b375d21e0a3340d4b72e5a9bba6756d3.jpg"></div><br>  The fact is that, in addition to the possibility of adding handwritten notes, this program has a whiteboard mode that resembles a multi-page flipchart.  You can not only draw on it, but also place there images, screenshots and graphic elements.  The screen shot made in the previous illustration is sent to the whiteboard.  You can add handwritten comments and return to working with the document at any time. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2db/93b/8eb/2db93b8ebc284ec5a04a6196a108b288.jpg"></div><br>  Thus, thanks to Easy Interactive Tools, we always have three useful functions at hand: <br><br><ul><li>  We work with documents right at the screen, using the interactive function as a mouse. </li><li>  We can add entries over the screen. </li><li>  At any time, you can switch to the ‚Äúwhiteboard‚Äù, placing everything you need during the discussion, or collecting the most important information there in the form of handwritten notes, fragments of documents, images, etc. </li></ul><br>  As a result, it will be much easier to hold discussions like the one captured in the picture below, with an interactive projector: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5af/cdc/3fd/5afcdc3fdd1d4b79a52613ffd91170d5.jpg"></div><br>  In summary, <i>Epson Easy Interactive Tools</i> is a great brainstorming tool, yet simple and convenient, just like a regular flipchart. <br><br><h2>  Firmware </h2><br>  Epson interactive projectors have a unique function: a light version of the <i>Easy Interactive Tools</i> program is built into the projector, which allows you to interact with the material on the screen without a computer!  It is turned on in modern models with a single touch to the screen: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fc/179/694/6fc1796949504c28807169050237969f.jpg"></div><br>  As in the case of the computer version, the embedded program has two modes: the mode of adding annotations over the contents of the screen and the ‚Äúwhiteboard‚Äù.  These two possibilities are always at hand, even if a video player is connected to the projector, or a computer of one of the employees, on which no special software is installed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/314/df9/fa5/314df9fa56e74cd3b4023b339a8cfd67.jpg"></div>  <i>Embedded Interactive Software Toolbar</i> <br><br>  It should be noted that there are models in the Epson line of interactive projectors that have even wider possibilities for working without a computer.  Speech about <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eb-1420wi/">Epson EB-1420Wi</a> and <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eb-1430wi/">Epson EB-1430Wi projectors</a> , flagships of the line.  For example, the whiteboard mode of these models allows you to embed images and multipage PDF documents from USB media and take a screen shot of the displayed source.  And the contents of the slide can be saved to USB. <br><br>  Included with these models is this control panel: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bff/d79/c61/bffd79c6154a465a84285b3b8f96cd5a.jpg"></div><br>  This panel allows you to control the projector wirelessly and / or act as a wired USB hub to connect Epson printers and MFPs to the projector, such as Epson Workforce.  You can send slides to print, as well as scan documents directly to the whiteboard with one click!  Another unique opportunity is sending the result of your work to an email address at any time if you have access to the Internet. <br><br><h2>  Network functionality </h2><br>  In addition to the above capabilities, the flagship models have the functionality necessary for conducting joint work sessions.  You can combine up to 4 projectors simultaneously in geographically remote locations into a single work session.  During these sessions, shared content is demonstrated, but all participants have access to interactive tools and the effect of each affects the overall image on the screen.  This function works both in PC mode, where it is called ‚Äú <b>Multi Location</b> ‚Äù, and in stand-alone mode, where it is referred to as ‚Äú <b>Whiteboard sharing</b> ‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff1/524/cf4/ff1524cf47854318806b6516219155c3.jpg"></div><br>  In the first case, the computer connects via the network to several projectors using <a href="http://epson.ru/support/software/software-projectors/">Epson EasyMP Network Projection</a> , designed for this purpose, transmitting images to them, and the projectors, in turn, have access to mouse functions and, among other things, <a href="http://epson.ru/support/software/software-projectors/">Epson Easy Interactive Tools</a> capabilities. . <br><br>  In the case of the Whiteboard sharing function, all projectors participating in the session work with the common space of the whiteboard.  Moreover: <b>through a normal web browser, any mobile device based on Android or iOS can be directly connected to the session!</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99a/4c4/7a6/99a4c47a69564ac7808a5f95b76b4f0f.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Instead of output </h2><br>  Summing up, I would like to remind once again that an interactive projector is a whole system.  And Epson is making every effort to ensure that the user is satisfied with each of its components, ranging from excellent image quality even in lit rooms thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/222115/">3LCD technology and high color brightness</a> , ending with the highest accuracy in determining touch positions, touch support and multi-touch, the ability to work without a computer, through the network, and so on and so forth! <br><br>  The post turned out to be quite voluminous, but even in it we could not describe all the possibilities provided by modern <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/proj-education-interactive/">Epson interactive projectors for business and education</a> .  Nevertheless, we hope that we managed the main thing: to show how interactive projectors are convenient and useful.  More recently, no one could have imagined that a projector could become a multifunctional interactive device.  Now the future has come. <br><br>  Recall that you personally familiarize yourself with Epson interactive projectors and try them in action is always possible <a href="http://epson.ru/demo/">in our demos</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375615/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375615/</a></p>
