Now we know what our potential customers want.  It's time to decide on what business model we will work - this will allow us to set a goal for our landing page.  Therefore, we will do the landing page specifically for the solution of one specific goal.  Let's build a sales funnel and develop a call to action. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">In the past parts we have disassembled:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/spagece/blog/21258/">1.

Customer needs and benefits</a> <br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/spagece/blog/22702/">4: Benefit Testing and Competitor Analysis</a> <br></div></div><br>  At the first stages, it is better and easier to work with the category of target audiences in which the problem exists already yesterday.  These are the hottest customers and they are the easiest to sell because they themselves want to buy.  The main thing is not to interfere with them and show all our benefits. <br><br>  Each client follows the steps of the AIDAS model: 
      <br>

      <br>
    <ul><li>  A - Attention (attention) </li><li>  I - Interest </li><li>  D - Desire (wish) </li><li>  A - Action (action) - The hottest customers, this is where they need to catch </li><li>  S - Satisfaction (satisfaction) </li></ul><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">All customers can be divided into 5 types</font> </h2><br><br>  A vivid example of passing through the stages of the model AIDAS, this is how I chose the bike.  Before I wanted a bike, I was type 5 (a dead client who has no problem).  Then I started reading forums and climbing sites to understand which bikes are, how they differ, what range of prices, etc.  Then I became type 4 (cold client, collects information).  When I read all this, I realized that I needed a mountain bike, a hardtail, with shimano attachments, a reliable aluminum frame, disc brakes, a hydraulic front fork ... And now I have type 3 (warm customer, starts to choose).  Now I started looking for bikes that suit my specifications.  I also read reviews about the brands of bicycles and equipment, so as not to miss the quality.  And now I have the long-awaited type 2 (hot client, compares what, where and how).  Hooray, I came to 3 models of bikes.  I am a potential hot customer.  I want a bike, I know what I want, I know the price plug and I want to spend money.  And then I compare the offers of stores.  What are special shares, delivery conditions, what is available.  And the street is already hot, and I need great yesterday.  Here I am already type 1 (very hot customer, wants to buy yesterday). <br><br>  The most interesting thing, when I collected information at different stages, I not only read the forums, but also clicked on paid bikes for advertising, just to see what they were like.  I looked for sites where you can find your bike on the parameters.  Why am I doing this?  And the fact that I spent hundreds of rubles in the advertising budget of online bicycle shops, but at that time I didn‚Äôt need a bicycle, I just collected information.  At this moment, analysts of such sites look at their web visitor and do not understand why I do not buy.  You understand that each type of customer needs its own landing page, its own list, its own approach.  And at each stage you can help the client understand the problem, and then offer the best offer.  Looking ahead to say, you understand how important it is to set up advertising specifically for targeted hot clients. <br><br>  Now let's see how to work with each type of customer.  We estimate the time spent on effort and money. <br><br>  <strong>Type 1</strong> are hot clients who need just yesterday.  They really want to buy.  The main thing they do not interfere with buy, have a decent and credible landing. <br><br>  <strong>Type 2</strong> - the client has a problem, he already wants to buy, compares the options and offers.  I work well with promotions, gifts, discounts and generally some advantages, benefits that you are a little or much better than your competitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd5/cf6/08a/cd5cf608a36b4718a7edc873c48363ed.jpg"><br><br>  For these types, create a Landing Page, direct advertising from hot clients and start earning.  There are different numbers of such people depending on the niche.  The bigger, the better.  The more geography, the more customers.  At this stage, the minimum transaction cycle time.  Money is spent only on advertising and attracting customers. <br><br>  <strong>Type 3</strong> - There is a problem, they are already selected and compared.  It is important to identify the criteria by which a person chooses.  We need to give something better than the competition.  A great option is to help a person choose, sometimes even compare himself with competitors, but so that your USP is more profitable. <br><br>  <strong>Type 4</strong> - There is a problem, collect information.  The basis is to give a person information.  For example, via e-mail newsletter.  Save him time, show that you understand the question.  He will respond with loyalty and great trust. <br><br>  It is better to send these types of clients first to an introductory landing page, then take mail from them.  To do them a series of letters (send 5 - 10 letters with content and information on their problem).  And then from the list they land on the selling landing page.  There are many more such people than the first two types, but it is already easier to sell them, although the cycle of a deal is much longer.  In this scheme, you increase the time from first contact to sale and, accordingly, costs.  But you can bite off a larger ‚Äúpiece of client pie‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb8/a99/a6a/fb8a99a6a849418398013a2708436a42.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>Type 5</strong> - do not know about the problem.  They have a problem, but they are not even aware of it.  Or do not know that such a product ever happens.  The most difficult type of client.  When working with the 5th type, you first need to send a person to the problematic landing page, which will tell you that there is such a problem.  And then according to the scheme of types 3 and 4. <br><br>  Long.  Expensive.  But a lot of sales in the future, if everything is done correctly.  Usually it is under the power of companies and cool specialists.  At first I do not advise to climb here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/708/23e/b0d/70823eb0de024c7c87b396f78cea10e4.jpg"><br><br>  My advice is when you start.  Look for customers in the first place of the 1st type, and then the 2nd.  Quickly invested money in advertising, made sales and quickly earned.  Repeated several times, and then you will try other models already. <br><br>  The business and sales model, as we remember, is always in the process of passing your potential client through the sales funnel stages.  So, landing pages do very well with such stages of converting users into the next funnel step.  It is important to understand that landing can transfer your client only to the next funnel stage and cannot jump over one of the stages in any way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d9/d8b/197/9d9d8b197e0a40ad805e4d55a5689c07.jpg"><br>  <i>Use the Landing Page to guide customers through the sales funnel, step by step.</i> <br><br>  To effectively convert a user, you need to tell him what we want from him.  Therefore, on a one-page there is always a Call to action (CTA) or a call to action that we want from it.  It can be a purchase, a contact for a call and a sale, a contact for an e-mail list, and then a landing page to convert to a phone and a sale. <br><br><blockquote>  Getting a contact always works better than selling it.  By offering value in exchange for a contact, you increase the number of contacts that you can already sell by phone. </blockquote><br><br>  The exhaust of this page at times more! <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Choose a business model.  Better is 1 - 2 type </li><li>  Create your own funnel - register the stages of your business model </li><li>  Determine what stage Landing Page is for. </li><li>  Add a landing goal for solving the funnel stage to the smart card </li></ol></blockquote><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Call to action ( - all to action) Scheme 1</font> </h2><br><br>  The point is to offer the person a simple, obvious, consistent step into the next funnel action. <br><br>  In the most general case, it is ‚Äúdo this, get it.‚Äù  That is, you offer a person to take a step right now, and in return he will receive a benefit / discount / gratuity / snacks / something cool or necessary / useful for solving his problem. <br><br>  CTA is definitely needed on all forms and on all buttons!  This is the law for a one-page vendor. <br><br>  <strong>Model 1 to create a CTA.</strong> <br>  <strong>Verb in the imperative mood + benefit</strong> <br><br>  <em>Examples</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Subscribe to our newsletter and get the book "How to make a newsletter."</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Sign up for a webinar today and get 3 video tutorials "How to write a selling text."</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Make a request and get expert advice for free.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Make a request and we will send you 3 free design options for your apartment.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Make a request now and we will give a 30% discount on delivery.</em> <em><br></em> <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Write 3 different CTAs (call to action) on model 1 </li><li>  Add to smart card </li></ol></blockquote><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">I want to buy, but not now, what to do?</font> </h2><br><br>  We need to create a restriction so that the client has the feeling that he can save money right now or better not lose some of the money.  If he makes an order / buys right now, it will be more profitable.  Usually artificial deficiency really works.  But you need to use very carefully and put it not everywhere.  It works differently in different niches, so you need to test.  The restrictions work cool when the product is really very cool and valuable.  Do not overdo it. <br><br>  How to create a limit or deadline? <br><br>  <strong>Model 1. Product Limit</strong> <br>  - The first 5 buyers at a discount.  (4 left) <br>  - The first 5 pieces at a price of 1,000 rubles.  (2 pieces left) <br>  - Every next product is more expensive. <br><br>  <strong>Model 2. Time Limit</strong> <br>  According to the deadline - until tomorrow, 3 days from receipt. <br>  Melting discount - every month increase, every next book is more expensive. <br><br>  <strong>Model 3. By time and product</strong> <br>  - This month we can take only 15 projects.  (4 left) <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Write 3 different restrictions for your product </li><li>  Add to smart card </li></ol></blockquote><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Call to action ( - all to action).</font>  <font color="#5b6166">Scheme 2</font> </h2><br><br>  <strong>Model 2.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>Verb in the imperative mood + deadline.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>Verb in the imperative mood + deadline + benefit.</strong> <br><br>  <em>Examples</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Leave the application right now and get the catalog for free!</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Call now and get expert advice!</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Call now and get a discount of 1000 rubles!</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Sign up for a webinar today and get 3 free books ‚ÄúHow to do business‚Äù for free!</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Call now and get 3 solutions to your problem!</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Call now and get free shipping!</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Leave your mail now and we will send you three wedding options.</em> <em><br></em> <br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Write 6 different calls to action </li><li>  Add to smart card </li></ol></blockquote><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Increase conversion with additional CTA</font> </h2><br><br>  Typically, the site does the main action that is required from the visitor, but often add an additional one.  What for? <br><br>  When people come to you who are not yet ready to perform the main target action (for example: they still choose, get acquainted with the proposals, monitor the niche) - they are not ready to buy, they need some preliminary, additional information. <br><br>  A lighter offer in exchange for some value.  A person, for example, is not yet ready to give his phone, and you offer him some content in exchange for mail.  For him, this is a simpler action. <br><br>  This approach has pros and cons.  You can reduce the conversion of the main action, but return some of those who wanted to leave and get contact information from them, through which you can later sell them.  What is more profitable for you and will bring more money, you can find out A / B tests, which I will tell you all about later. <br><br>  Great!  We took another step towards our goal. <br>  In the next chapter, we'll finally start making our one-page so that at the end of the course you get a Landing Page selling. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br><br>  We are always happy to help, the <a href="https://spagece.com/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3Dkurs-lp-part5">Spagece</a> team is a simple editor for quickly creating websites (Landing Page, subscription pages, events, conferences, webinars, personal pages, small online stores, etc.) for your tasks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297444/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297444/</a></p>
