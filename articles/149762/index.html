Feel the beauty of flight, look at the world from their height. <br>  Map services provide us with this opportunity - these are Yandex air panoramas (flight altitude 150 ... 200 meters, helicopter and balloon shooting), and also Google (shooting from balloons and kites). <br>  The view is beautiful. <br>  The disadvantage is that these types of static and for movement to the next ball, you must perform various actions, which reduces the charm of flight. <br>  As you know, birds are not standing still, they are always in motion, so one of the options for images from the air can be a dynamic flight. <br><br>  In one of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/136981/%3F">comments</a> , in addition to using static circular panoramas from the air, Yandex suggested flying over cities at low altitude. <br>  Since then, nothing has changed, so I tried to implement it on my own. <br><br>  The idea is that cartographic services implement the ‚ÄúFly‚Äù, or ‚ÄúFly‚Äù layer, to which fans of micro, small and large aviation would be able to upload dynamic video from the cameras of their flying vehicles.  Just like this is now done for photos.  After providing this opportunity, aviators quickly fill the cards with a bird's eye on the world. <br>  As flying objects, you can use aircraft with a video camera installed.  These could be balloons, model airplanes and helicopters, drones, small and large aircraft, and even spacecraft. <br>  A lot of videos already exist on the Internet, you only need to make it possible to link them to the terrain on map services.

      For the first flight, Berezovaya Street was chosen.  I sometimes travel around it by car and it is world famous for the fact that for more than twenty years of history this city street did not know a hard surface. <br>  On Google Earth it might look like this. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdd/452/9d1/bdd4529d15439f84df7ff8a2baf11202.jpg"><br><br>  In reality, the flight of the bird was so <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nbn-5c-fETM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhMUS3qpG_I--j_VDPBkeePM8A4Dw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now it is clear that such a complex street in terms of flights should have been chosen later.

In a word, everything that is interesting to see or expensive to man. <br>  Interesting shooting when circling interesting objects.  It's like a circular panorama, just looking inward. <br><br>  Ideally, it is advisable to equip the flying side with several cameras so that you can look at the flight in all directions. <br>  After all, not everyone is looking forward, there are lovers to look around or look back. <br><br>  <b>Purchase.</b> <br>  You can buy Dronich in Russia, but in Europe it is much more interesting and cheaper.  Moreover, it turned out a separate and fascinating story. <br>  I wanted to fly for a long time.  Yes, and flew, but as a passenger.  But in order wherever you want ... <br>  With the theory of flight is well known thanks to his father, the pilot and aviation education.  There was always a desire to collect a plane, a helicopter or a drone, especially since the articles on Habr√© were constantly provoked.  But there was not enough time for this, and dreams were postponed until later. <br>  And now, I read an article about an interesting model with an adequate price.  In fact, it is a flying computer with an HD camera and easy operation. <br><br>  By coincidence, at the same time a trip is scheduled ‚ÄúGallop in Europe‚Äù.  In this tour there was a great desire to experience an electronic guide in the Czech Republic: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145956/">‚ÄúSkolkovo is on your desk (or a story about how I made an electronic device from scratch)‚Äù</a> , but the correspondence with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/aureliano_b/">Dmitry</a> showed that for such a rapid raid on Prague this is not very successful sentence.  Postponed for later. <br>  How is a trip without electronics?  It was decided to buy a drone with a video camera. <br>  There was a thought about the delivery by courier to a Paris hotel, where we will spend three nights.  Correspondence with French sellers was not crowned with success ... It is better to know a foreign language in order to understand them well, and as I understand it, own an electronic payment system. <br><br>  I first saw him in Berlin, but there were no circumstances. <br><br>  Next try in Paris.  In a nightly Internet wander, a nephew found a similar store in the French capital.  The trip to Disneyland was replaced by a drone purchase.  We got acquainted with the Paris metro, walked along the streets and now the goal was achieved - the store in front of us.  But here another disappointment awaited us - the drone was not found there.  For international communication, one of the sellers brought a fancy phone.  You speak it in Russian, the device translates the sound into text, then you choose the language into which you want to translate the text, the seller reads the text in his native language and so on.  Contact is established.  As a result of a brief conversation, it turned out that the store had made re-trading and is now selling other goods.  The word is certainly beautiful, but there is no product we need. <br><br>  The next stop is Luxembourg. <br>  There is a shop in the city, but after a sightseeing tour, lunch, and a reduction in time due to a Parisian delay, one tourist remained only an hour before departure.  We decided to take a chance with my nephew. <br>  Thanks to the navigator, quick steps and several traffic violations, the goal was reached.  And lo and behold - he is waiting for us! <br>  Nephew, too, decided to take myself.  And here we are with two large boxes and one small spare battery, which turned out to be according to the seller last, we come to the checkout.  Time is running out.  The guide warned: ‚ÄúYou're late, you will go to Prague by taxi‚Äù. <br>  Before us is a man with CDs and a girl with small things.  Next, the scene from the department store ‚ÄúBullet‚Äù. <br>  A man pays with an electronic card - many in Europe do this so as not to carry cash and save time. <br>  The reader in the hands of the cashier does not accept the card or problems with the code, we do not understand.  The second attempt, the third ... Called the elder in the hall, repeating unsuccessful attempts.  Conversation in an incomprehensible Luxembourgish language. <br>  Sweat stepped on my forehead. <br>  As a result, the goods are delayed, the man is sent somewhere to clarify the situation. <br>  Next girl.  Fortunately, she doesn‚Äôt have an e-card and a handful of small things with local sights are poured into the cash desk.  It remains to knock out the check, but as expected, ends the cash register. <br>  The cashier is young, beautiful, but inexperienced.  Paper refilling is an operation for which a specially trained person is invited. <br>  Nerves and time to the limit. <br>  And here is the ticket office in front of us, but a man appears who has found out everything with his card and is already ready to pay.  Fortunately, this noble Luxembourgian showed an act of mercy and let us go ahead.  Thank you so much! <br>  Our euro-cash after checking the fake detector is moved to the cashier of the store.  There is no time left for registration of tax-free and we run to the point of departure.  So here it is, a flying camera, for which ran throughout Europe, says our guide. <br><br>  Prague is a beautiful city.  He waved his hand to Dmitry, just in case in the direction of London.  Most likely he was there, especially the Olympics ... <br><br>  And here is Dronich at home.  Instructions studied, batteries charged, the first flight took place.  There is a new point of view.  Video on YouTube. <br>  The music on the video did not overlap for several reasons: <br>  1. In recent years, there has been a trend: what kind of music you do not impose, sooner or later a message about violations of rights comes in and advertising appears, which is not entirely pleasant.  What to do with this is not clear.  I myself have not yet learned to compose music, although this is probably the most correct way out. <br>  2. All people have different musical tastes, it is impossible to choose music that suits everyone, therefore, <br>  3. On the map services should be possible when watching these videos to impose your favorite music. <br>  4. One of the soundtrack options may be the narrator‚Äôs story about the objects currently appearing or captions on the screen. <br><br>  <b>Observations during filming.</b> <br>  1. Compared to European cities, we have a large number of overhead lines - power transmission, cable TV, advertising banners.  This not only interferes with the conduct of aerial surveys, but also spoils the appearance of cities. <br>  2. People relate differently to flying objects.  Most do not care.  Young people are not surprised, because in movies and games this does not happen either. <br>  Interest is shown by people of middle and older generation.  Apparently the dream was not just me.  One grandmother asked for a long time about everything and then made an interesting thought that there must be a large device with a man on board. <br>  3. I was interested in a wedding photographer who decided to add a few frames to the wedding movie from an unusual point of view. <br>  4. Shooting from the air attracts its novelty not only people.  In the movie with the city lake, pigeons flew twice nearby.  During the shootings, kites close up, apparently they feel a fellow or a game.  On Berezovaya Street, when landing, the cat took Dronich for a bird and wanted to attack. <br><br>  <b>Some practical advice from a little experience that has already appeared.</b> <br>  1. First you need to learn how to fly in order to make a normal video, not to threaten the device or to harm others. <br>  2. Strictly comply with safety regulations when flying near people, animals, objects, power lines. <br>  3. One of the best vehicles for shooting long streets is a motorcycle with a sidecar or a rickshaw.  Then the driver sees the flying machine well and agrees with him his speed, and the operator freely controls the flight.  In our case, the car was used where the brother was the helmsman.  He did not see the drone, so it was necessary to adjust the speed in words, and to control - leaning out of the window.  All this is inconvenient and affects the quality of flight.  It is also necessary to follow the rules of road traffic, while you have to slow down the apparatus flying in the air.  This is clearly seen in the video from Builders Avenue. <br>  4. At high altitudes and distances, as well as in conditions of radio interference, it is better to record on an onboard USB flash drive than on a tablet over a radio channel.  In our shooting, this can be seen from the shooting on the lake, where the recording on the tablet was turned on and the image disappeared at high altitudes. <br>  Also on Berezovaya Street it was impossible to control the device because of the passing high-voltage line.  Therefore, the recording does not start from the beginning of the street. <br>  5. It is advisable to adjust the setting of Dronich so that it is as ‚Äúslowed down‚Äù as possible.  Then the image will change more smoothly.  This is especially true of models where the camera is rigidly connected to the body, as in our case. <br>  6. It is well helped by Youtube, which, noticing the camera shake when the device is in flight, helps to reduce them significantly.  On Habr√© about this were articles: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/116002/">‚ÄúIt's Magic: YouTube‚Äôs video-based video editor allows you to stabilize the image on the fly.‚Äù</a> <br>  and <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143420/">‚ÄúImproved stabilization on Youtube‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  <b>Future.</b> <br>  Over time, there will definitely appear specialized devices for the implementation of high-quality video from different heights. <br>  In the sky will fly Gugledron, Bingolet and Yandex dragonfly. <br><br>  But the sky is not yet occupied, and therefore there are two dreams: <br>  1. Unrealizable.  In the near future we will fly along the asphalted Berezovaya street, where only grown birch will be the obstacles. <br>  2. Easy to implement.  See the layer ‚ÄúFly‚Äù on the maps, where all lovers can add their flights.  Just by that time I will learn to fly a little. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  Created <a href="http://compulenta.computerra.ru/tehnika/robotics/10009552/">UAV for professional aero mapping</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149762/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149762/</a></p>
