  <section class="page js-page"><h1>God is a stupid game designer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/935cbf93/1f01070c/e3ef425b/6bcaf000.jpg" align="left">  You have probably heard that there are adult people who believe that the whole universe, all matter-space, our planet Earth and all its inhabitants are created by some supernatural super-intelligent being nicknamed God?  Personally, I can‚Äôt imagine how to be serious about such ideas.  But the general meaning of the biblical story that the all-knowing God created our world and ourselves, and now closely watches what is happening, prompted me to think that this is a classic gamedev.  And then I decided literally for a second to accept the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ‚Äúdivine creation‚Äù and see if it coped well with its task, as some people say? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start with the fact that God has worked incredibly high quality physics of the universe.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking several types of tiny particles and simply setting different rules for their interaction, as always, is always a winning one.  Generating space using the Big Bang is very convenient, but there are questions about the small randomization, due to dependence on a single random sequence.  And the generation time of 5 billion years is somehow a bit much, especially considering the possible preliminary tests.  General physical laws and thermodynamics - excellent.  Gravity was too dragged, if it were less - in general it would be more spectacular. <br><br>  The formation of stars and planets from cosmic dust and gas, the synchronization of their movement, non-equilibrium systems and the formation of life, evolution and natural selection, oxygen catastrophe, eukaryotes, phytoplankton crisis, angiospermization of gymnosperms, mammalization of theriodonts - all this turned out damn interesting, although I must admit that some missions were rather tricky and complex.  God‚Äôs simulators are just perfect.  He would have to make several similar projects on different topics and such a portfolio would satisfy even the most corrosive customer.

      With the emergence of higher intelligence and people, everything was pretty good at first, but exactly until people learned to use tools.  Primitive plant growing and cattle breeding still somehow fit into the overall picture of the divine world, but the subsequent appearance of science within the framework of the game world was regarded by God as malicious cheating.  God would like us to quietly coexist with other species in the wild, graze cattle, collect what God will give and slowly evolved to a new level in 200-300 thousand years.  And we smartly invented the wheel, the lever, the geometry, the construction, and even managed to invent a steam engine (Heron, 100 years BC) - which under the current conditions equates to the malicious use of scripts! <br><br>  And what do you think God did?  Admitted that the game moved to a completely different level and instead of a simulator became a social and economic strategy?  And based on the analysis of the situation, I changed, say, the probability system for the righteous to have a bonus, and for sinners a penalty, well, or something else like that?  Instead, God made the classic move of illiterate game designers - he did not find anything clever how to send a prophet-avatar and establish a direct ban on what he thought was wrong.  Yes, yes, all the same classic commandments: <br><ul><li>  Game designer - god! </li><li>  Read rules! </li><li>  No cheats! </li><li>  No scripts! </li><li>  No PvP! </li><li>  No loot! </li><li>  No rush! </li><li>  No friendly fire! </li></ul><br>  So what came of it?  Yes, almost nothing.  For several centuries, God managed to stop the flourishing of cheating science with the help of church moderation, but that‚Äôs all.  In general, the impression was that God simply does not know psychology, game theory and cybernetics. <br><br>  Bans never work.  Sometimes they even do the opposite - they increase the value of a prohibited action.  In any game system, in essence, the task of the players is reduced to finding the optimal algorithm for passing, or how to get more results for less spent resources.  If there is a profitable opportunity to do this, then even if it is forbidden, players will still use it, but already considering the possible risks from probable punishment.  See no examples from your own life - who among you did not walk on the lawn?  (I, by the way, bypass this prohibition simply - I don‚Äôt walk on the lawn, but ride it on a bicycle.) Did you break the traffic rules?  Not parked in the wrong place?  You did not do it as part of an act of civil disobedience, but because it was more convenient and easier for you, right?  If you would be more convenient and easier not to do this - then you would not do that.  Instead of creating bans, one should strive for game balance by adjusting other gaming mechanisms. <br><br>  And yet this is the introduction of such an indicator as "sin", and only to indicate the degree of violation of prohibitions.  And what is the most stupid, this indicator is invisible and can not be accurately determined.  His testimony is buried somewhere deep in the game mechanics and difficult to determine even by indirect evidence.  What could be more idiotic than invisible indicators?  It is claimed that it regulates the possibility of additional conservation in the system after death.  There are mentions of this in divine documentation, but there is no exact mention of exactly how this works.  In addition, there is a general concern that, like any programmer tweak in a hurry, this function simply does not work. <br><br>  For obvious reasons, God cannot himself appear in our world, just like you cannot appear in World of Warcraft with a chainsaw in hand.  Therefore, he needed a team of moderators in the form of churchmen and priests to control the implementation of the prohibitions.  But alas, they are the same players as the rest and are also looking for the same optimal algorithms.  Therefore, they quite reasonably began to trade violations of prohibitions and cleansing from sins.  It is as natural as snow in winter.  It is strange for those who expected otherwise. <br><br>  In a situation with low-level players, God has the same mess as in most MMORPGs.  Instead of making the starting zones and speeding up the pumping - he hung a lot of moral penalties on high-level players, and a bunch of bonuses on beginners, so much so that it became more profitable to be novices than to pump.  As a result, it is more profitable to remain an unhappy sufferer clumsy than pumping over to a self-confident intellectual. <br><br>  The result: the technical part of the universe is excellent, and the socio-economic - an epic failure.  And the reason for the failure in principle is even understandable.  It is that God, apparently, is really completely alone.  And he had nowhere to find out what society is and what are its features.  Yes, and in our psychology he didn‚Äôt have time to figure it out at all (he doesn‚Äôt even know about the peculiarities of consciousness perception of logical particles like ‚Äúnot‚Äù).  Well, that's okay.  I think God should in the coming years send us a couple of prophets, let them get a good education and get a decent experience as a practicing psychologist and game designer in some famous game company.  After their death, they will share their knowledge with God and maybe something will change for the better in this our universe. <br><br>  By the way, if you remember that God once promised the Second Coming, the Apocalypse and the Full Reboot?  I think he just got nervous in that situation.  To roll back the state of all quanta in the universe is an incredibly resource-intensive and, in addition, still meaningless, since it is hardly possible to change something in the course of evolution.  It will be the same but slightly different.  And what's the point of spending money on something if all the resources have already been spent on development and on the Big Bang.  Energy is already spent and used.  If something went wrong - it's easier to throw it in a landfill and let it burn down billions more years. <br><br>  In general, let God quickly comprehend our science, if it is, of course. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103764/</a></p>
