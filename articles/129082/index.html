A distinctive feature is that it combines both a rating and an exchange, the customer has the sole right to choose the performer of his project, focusing on the rating. <br><br>  <b>URL:</b> <a href="http://topprogon.com/">http://topprogon.com/</a> <br><br>  When an idea was conceived, the meaning of this resource was conceived as creating an extremely ordinary rating of site registration specialists, to some extent even exclusively for a narrow circle of people, but after a short time allotted for discussion, the idea was reincarnated into a full-fledged stock exchange, with its own advantages and minuses, but at the same time and containing some kind of rating.

      At this stage of implementation, there is only the basic concept of the exchange, implemented <s>on snot</s> with great enthusiasm, but alas, without a specific expectation of a certain result in terms of demand for this resource. <br><br><h4>  Purpose of the exchange </h4><br>  The resource is designed to facilitate the relationship between the specialist providing services for site registration (in catalogs, blogs, etc.) and the owner of the resource who wants to use this service.  The market for site registration offers is relatively large, there are both conscientious executors and not so much (well, like everywhere else), as a result, in my opinion, a separate resource providing the opportunity to choose the right service and a rating specialist, contact him, order and in the end get the result, it seems in demand :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Exchange Functionality </h4><br>  The basis will be based on the standard functions of the exchange - personal messages, payment through the site, reviews, profiles and more.  But in its essence, the project is different in that we cannot open a project and wait for a cloud of offers from freelancers (I think this is a plus, although someone will find it on the contrary a minus), a potential customer himself has the right to choose exactly who he wants, and not run into the flow of spam to yourself in a personal with suggestions.  For a better choice, it is the rating of specialists that will be implemented, according to which they will line up in categories and on the main page of the resource.  In addition, a standard ‚Äúrisk-free transaction‚Äù will be introduced for guarantees, a Webmoney account is bolted from a non-standard, user certification option (personal certificates are stored only on our server, and therefore it will be much more difficult to give someone else for your own, I think the reason is clear =)) .  In addition, each ‚Äúdriver‚Äù can pass the verification, i.e.  perform a test run for a standard site, the results of which are written feedback from the service and much more. <br><br>  Now the idea has already been ground in all the nuances and is slowly but surely being implemented by experts, I want to hear public opinion about it, some thoughts on functionality, ideas and so on.  I would like to end up with a full-fledged product that is in demand, and not lost somewhere in the annals of history) <br><br><h4>  Contacts </h4><br>  e-mail: support@topprogon.com <br>  icq: 606141433 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129082/</a></p>
