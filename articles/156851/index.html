  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Innovation has nothing to do with it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the top <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/156761/">post</a> today with reference to the "regular review of the smartphone."  And without that a not very long post can be conveyed even shorter, with the words: go nafig with your smartphones, I need a battery!  I will answer it not only because it was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/156717/">my review</a> , but also because the topic raised also concerns me too. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b0/5a3/2f9/9b05a32f9c6f8800ef3870c1988ce9ea.jpg"><br>  <i>To hell with such innovations!</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Batteries on modern smartphones are tears, of course.  When I switched from a regular phone to smartphones, I experienced a period of frustration, when I didn‚Äôt understand why with the active use mode - and why buy a phone with a lot of bells and whistles if you are not going to use them?  - The battery is melting before our eyes.  But then, looking around, he discovered that it was all so. <br><br>  But you don‚Äôt need to interfere with everything in a heap - the screen diagonal and its resolution is one of the key parameters of their usability now.  Axis, processor and further downward.  And each user chooses what is more important to him - the ability to check mail, make routes and chat on the go, or not to charge the phone every day.  You can, of course, do it this way - walk with a simple telephone.  This is normal - many people really do not need to check their mail every half hour, they are well aware of their city and they don‚Äôt need maps, they can take pictures of fun for someone, and there‚Äôs a player for music and radio.  You can wait for the engineers to finally make a powerful and compact battery - there is no doubt that this will happen.  And you can use the possibilities of progress in other areas now, accepting the rules of the game.  Not that it was a great choice, but such are the realities - the progress in microelectronics and soft engineering does not necessarily have to be accompanied by the same progress in the more fundamental disciplines of iron.  After all, there is no problem in making now the phone with a battery, with which it will work reliably for at least a day.  Only he will weigh a pound more.

      It does not occur to us to resent publicly the need to spend 8-10 hours a day to sleep in order to regain our strength, or that we spend another couple of hours several times a day on food so that, again, we don‚Äôt die.  But some are not limited to this program at least, but find the strength to go in for sports.  Do you know how infuriating I am to move my mortal body in space?  Although I‚Äôm sure everyone thought about such a plan, few people would dare to write the post ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm going to be shitting myself until the engineers create a teleportator so that I can move my shit down the drain‚Äù - because he knows he will be answered. <br><br>  I will not be afraid, and give a link to the scowling video, where an American humorist asks a sacramental question: why should a person decide that he owes something, what he learned 10 minutes ago?  In general, I am not against such posts in principle, and some part of me is greeted by cries of indignation at the quiet ‚Äúheeea‚Äù - because it is possible and necessary to talk about your needs.  I was outraged by another - innovation, then why kick?  From the fact that the batteries in the phones are weak, progress in other areas can only be called incredible.  Whole behavioral patterns are changing before our eyes in a few years, thanks to the development of communication technologies and the growth of their mobility. <br><br>  Let us return once more to the fact that the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/javascript/" class="user_link">javascript</a> user was targeted to: <br><br><ul><li>  Huge screen !!! </li><li>  More than 320 dpi !!! </li><li>  4-core processor !!! </li><li>  Separate GPU !!! </li><li>  12000000 pixel camera !!! </li><li>  4G / LTE / WiFi n-standard !!! </li><li>  GPS / A-GPS / NFC / Bluetooth !!! </li><li>  Only for 600 euros !!! </li></ul><br>  - there is exactly one really useless line in this list - just due to physical limitations on dimensions, which have so far not been circumvented.  Everything else is really progress.  Which, thank God, goes forward regardless of. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156851/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156851/</a></p>
