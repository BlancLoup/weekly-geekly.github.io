Working in IT, he always followed fashion trends.  Sergey was the first to receive the Yandex.Money card (although he did not know where to apply it), first bought the Mi Note phone at the time when Xiaomi was still a rising star.  A visit to the post office was for him a bit of a trip to a trendy club, where advanced lovers of Chinese gadgets meet. <br><br>  In recent years, Sergei has tried many popular online banks, but the last pearl of his collection - "T", was especially good.  A bank without an office, a bank without references and intrusive service.  All the best in one. <br><br>  A little fed up with ordinary overdraft-grace-periods, he was waiting for something more.  And more has come. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On Sunday evening, he found an email in his inbox.  "T" unmistakably understood with whom he was dealing.

      “Sergey, we invite you to try our new service first - online investments!” Stylish stock pictograms with Facebook and Apple logos fastened the letter like a noble wax seal. <br><br>  He followed the link, clicked “I agree,” and registered an account with a broker.  Perhaps he became their first customer! <br><br>  For two days, he painfully waited for registration, anticipating all the new things that await him.  Needless to say, life pampers those who are at the forefront of progress. <br><br>  Tuesday night, the bell rang.  The number was not recorded in his notebook.  “Probably, broker!”, Thought Sergey and pressed the answer button. <br><br>  “Sergey Alexandrovich?” - his insinuating female voice greeted him. <br>  "Yes, I am listening to you." <br>  “You are greeted by the FastestFandFreeMoney Company!  You are very lucky, we approved a loan of 1,000,000 rubles for you.  Can you come for the money today? ” <br>  Sergey was a little discouraged. <br>  “Uh ... where did you get my number?  I don't need a loan, I already have two.  Or three. " <br>  “This is a very good offer, and we have reduced the rate especially for you.  Only 146%.  Others pay 150. " <br>  “I don’t need anything, do not call me again, please,” answered Sergey with irritation. <br>  “You are so vain, Sergey Alexandrovich.  In vain.  You should not refuse some offers.  I’m sure you’ll regret it. ”  Steel tone appeared in the girl's voice.  In the tube short beeps were heard. <br><br>  Before he could hang up, the bell rang again. <br><br>  “Money Company afterBegins welcomes you!  Let's talk? ”Sergey hung up.  The phone did not let up.  "Hello!  Reach Up to the Receipts!  Would you like a loan? ” <br>  “Yes, go to hell with you all!” He hissed into the phone in fury and turned off the phone. <br><br>  Sergey sat back in his chair and wiped the sweat from his forehead.  “What a crazy house.  I didn't leave a room to anyone.  Where did this damned horde pull him out?  Perhaps today I should leave work early. ” <br><br>  Approaching the house, he saw two strong men standing at the entrance at the entrance.  He came closer, but there was no way to miss them. <br><br>  “What apartment are you in?” One of the strangers asked ingratiatingly. <br>  “At the seventeenth,” answered Sergey, perplexedly.  “Police what?” He thought. <br>  “So you, therefore, Sergey Alexandrovich, passport 6516 898989, were born on March 1, 1978 in Zelenodolsk?” The second stranger asked with unexpected enthusiasm. <br>  “Yes, it's me,” answered Sergey and was even more confused.  “And what is the actual thing?” <br>  “Discounts.  Today is a good day for you, Sergei.  IP Bagrov especially makes 50% discount for you.  On the coffins. " <br>  Sergey backed out. <br>  “I don't need any coffins!” <br>  "Everyone says like that.  For the time being, Sergey.  Frankly, you don't look that good.  Take in reserve. " <br>  "I do not need .." - Sergey answered in a low, confused voice. <br>  “Take - you will not regret.  Do not take - regret.  I’m ga-ran-ti rue to you, ”the stranger said with a smirk. <br>  Sergey has a crush in his chest, and his face has become even paler. <br>  “Do not worry, so.  For now (for now) you can store your gadgets in it.  After all, you buy a lot on Aliexpress?  Understand correctly, we carefully studied the history of your card transactions. ” <br><br>  Looks like the next year of Sergey’s life was expected to be quite fun. <br><br>  <b>Question to the reader - where was Sergey wrong?</b> <br><br>  And the solution is simple.  The Internet has made our life convenient.  You can buy goods all over the world, pay taxes with one click, buy electronic tickets anywhere.  Free, no commission.  Cheaper than offline. <br><br>  But there is one very expensive thing that many want to get.  This is your personality.  Your personal data.  One awkward movement, and you put your life, your peace of mind and safety to a serious test. <br><br>  Recently, a well-known bank "T" offered its customers cooperation with a brokerage company.  The conditions are very interesting.  All that is required of you - put a tick "consent to the processing of personal data." <br><br>  But this is a mistake.  Here are some excerpts from this amazing document: <br><br><blockquote>  “I agree to the Bank to process all my personal data specified in the application by any means, <b>including third parties,</b> with the aim of: <br>  sending me information about new products and services of the Bank and / or <b>its counterparties</b> . <br><br>  I agree to the Bank on the transfer of personal data to <b>microfinance organizations</b> - Bank Partners (hereinafter - MFIs) and the processing of personal data of MFOs in order to inform me about the possibility of obtaining consumer loans (loans) from MFOs. <br><br>  I agree to the <b>Bank’s counterparties</b> to process all of my personal data. <br><br>  This consent is given <b>for a period of 15 years</b> , and in case of its withdrawal, the processing of my personal data should be terminated by the Bank and / or third parties and the data destroyed subject to termination of the Agreement and full repayment of the debt under the Agreement <b>no later than 1 (one) year</b> from the date Termination of the Agreement. <br><br>  I agree to receive my mailing on a mobile radio telephone network from the Bank and its affiliates. ” </blockquote><br>  Perhaps the story of Sergei will remind you of the value of personal data.  Be careful who and why you allow to look into your personal life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399065/</a></p>
