But with the <a href="http://games.mail.ru/pc/articles/feat/oculus_rift_i_drugie_tehnologii_virtualnoj_realnosti/">advent of</a> working versions of the Oculus Rift helmet and other virtual reality devices, some developers began to think seriously about this topic.  For Oculus Rift, there <a href="http://games.mail.ru/pc/articles/feat/oculus_rift_i_porno_igry_18/">are</a> already <a href="http://games.mail.ru/pc/articles/feat/oculus_rift_i_porno_igry_18/">unpretentious porn games</a> , the main meaning of which is to strip a virtual girl naked.  But technology does not stand still, and right now amateurs and professionals around the world are working to create more advanced programs and controllers for virtual sex. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Virtual chest that can be touched </h1><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Re_W4enbGGk&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjOgdL8TtgxoxbnkQGYQpvgrloKBg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Japanese under the nickname Ryuto so far decided to concentrate only on the female breast and tactile sensations from it.  The work he invented the simulator is clearly demonstrated in the video.  For a realistic sensation of the process here are responsible: Oculus Rift, Leap Motion motion sensor, Arduino Mega 2560 board and an eccentric mouse pad in the shape of a girl with a large chest.  Leap Motion tracks the position of the player‚Äôs hands, while the Arduino, connected to the chest pad, reads the applied pressure.  At this time in the virtual space of a blue-haired girl is filled with paint and beeps.  According to Ryuto, he conceived this project to close the distance between reality and the virtual world, which can now be touched too.

    <h1>  Virtual knees that you can put your head on </h1><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNI87lpTdOQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhiVi21vsThL2jKFV4o45CsK9yIPA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="https://share.oculusvr.com/app/sleeping-on-unity-chans-lap">Sleeping on UNITY-CHAN's lap</a> is a somewhat more chaste version of the previous fun.  Japanese studio Up Frontier has created a simple dating simulator for Unity-chan, the mascot of the Unity game engine.  Model of the heroine is <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/">in the public domain</a> .  The game offers to sit on a bench with a virtual heroine, and then put her head on her knees - that is, on a special pillow on this side of the screen. <br><br><h1>  Breakfast and sleep with Mika Hatsune </h1>  The Japanese programmer Negipoyoshi has created a <a href="http://en.rocketnews24.com/2013/10/08/wanna-sleep-with-hatsune-miku-theres-an-app-for-that/">simulator</a> in which, using Oculus Rift, you can sleep next to Mika Hatsune, a popular Japanese singer in Japan.  Miku wishes the user a good night, asks if everything is all right if he turns in bed, and also wakes up in the morning at a pre-set time.  Hug at this time you need a growth pillow with the image of the heroine.  When you wake up, you can switch to another Negipoyoshi <a href="http://en.rocketnews24.com/2014/08/25/virtual-girlfriend-technology-in-japan-on-track-with-drink-sharing-simulation-for-oculus-rift/">job</a> , offering to share a glass of cola with Mika.  The heroine repeats the user's movements and enjoys good weather - the action takes place in a cafe by the sea.  Or in a dark room with closed curtains, if you put the Oculus Rift to the side. <br><br><h1>  Simulator lasting seduction </h1>  If the Japanese use Oculus Rift to go to the world of fictional characters, then Western developers are trying to copy reality as accurately as possible.  For example, the dating simulator <a href="http://www.xmoonproductions.com/learn_more/">XstoryPlayer</a> tries to display the seduction process in detail.  The developers, studio X Moon Productions, work out the plot scenarios in detail - each girl has her own character and preferences, including sexual ones, and before getting access to the body, you need to spend about 5-7 hours.  In XstoryPlayer there are no pre-registered dialogues - the player enters his own phrases from the keyboard, and he is answered by a simple virtual interlocutor who snatches keywords like ‚Äúass‚Äù and ‚Äúsuck‚Äù from the phrases.  There is almost no feedback in the game - what is happening in XstoryPlayer is not like a date with a sequel, but a porn movie with a long prologue. <br><br><h1>  The most realistic models of women </h1>  Although the ladies from XstoryPlayer look much more realistic than anime girls in Japanese projects, they still don't seem believable.  However, at this level are now almost all <a href="http://games.mail.ru/pc/articles/feat/oculus_rift_i_porno_igry_18/">adult entertainment</a> for the Oculus Rift. <br><br>  British studio Veiview has set itself the goal of creating realistic virtual mistresses who have minimal differences from real people.  Their first project, the technology demo Lucid Dreams for the Oculus Rift, shows the first workings of the studio.  In it, the user is transferred to a room with seven models of naked girls in different poses.  Models are static, and so far they can only be viewed from different angles, but their detailing and plausibility are impressive now.  Veiview took advantage of 3D-scanning of real people and imposed on the texture models in the resolution of 8K.  While the developers do not say when their characters will begin to move, and admit that they themselves do not know the release date for Lucid Dreams.  At the moment, the project is at an early stage of development - the authors have not even decided on the engine and are doing prototypes for Unity and the Unreal Engine 4 at the same time. Now you can <a href="http://www.veiviev.com/lucid-dreams-v2">download the</a> first demo of Lucid Dreams on the studio website. <br><br><h1>  PlayStation 4 and Japanese schoolgirls </h1><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsVeBjtWgmo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi0-J7ov44mnx3vDp7wfSA272yVcg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The only notable project in the camp of the Oculus Rift competitors is the Summer Lesson for Project Morpheus, a virtual reality slam for the PlayStation 4, announced in September. It is being done by the authors of the Tekken fighting game series.  In Summer Lesson, the player is transferred to the room of the Japanese schoolgirl, with whom you can interact, shaking her head in different directions.  You should not count on something more intimate - the game is created under the supervision of Sony.  However, so far Summer Lesson looks like the most solid project among all the developments in the industry - although the virtual girl is not distinguished by the detail of Lucid Dreams, she is realistically animated and adequately responds to the player‚Äôs actions.  If the game has new ways of interacting with the heroine, the brisk schoolgirl can become, if not the lover, then at least a prototype of the virtual friend of the future. <br><br><h1>  Future </h1>  Despite the rapid development of the industry, the day when everyone can get a virtual girl, it will not come soon.  First, progress in the field of specialized peripherals, with rare <a href="http://games.mail.ru/pc/news/2014-07-30/novyj_kontroller_pomozhet_zhenschinam_ispytyvat_dolgie_orgazmy/">exceptions</a> , stands still.  Connecting unusual controllers and motion sensors with masturbators and voluminous mouse pads are purely amateur entertainment without plans for mass production.  Large companies are still trying not to get involved in such controversial things, and individual enthusiasts pay more attention to new <a href="http://games.mail.ru/pc/articles/feat/oculus_rift_i_drugie_tehnologii_virtualnoj_realnosti/">gaming</a> , rather than erotic controllers.  Secondly, platform owners can hold back progress ‚Äî a year ago, Google banned pornography in Glass apps, and Project Morpheus was initially tied to Sony's closed moderated platform.  Oculus Rift is still open - developers are quietly buying helmets and making games using the affordable Unity engine.  But do not forget that since March of this year, the owner of Oculus VR is the company Facebook, known for its tough policy on adult content.  Whether Oculus Rift will remain the same free platform after entering the open market is a big question. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362633/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362633/</a></p>
