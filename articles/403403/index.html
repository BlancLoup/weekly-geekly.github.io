The project is fully secured, and we want to thank each sponsor for their support and patience.  We could not have done it without you!

    <h4>  <b>I made a donation and still have not received a reward.</b> </h4><br>  Those who place an order, we are constantly sending packages, if you have filled the survey forum.  Over the next two weeks we will ship 885 packages.  This is for those who have already completed the survey form. <br><br><h4>  <b>What is the survey form?</b> </h4><br>  All customers must fill out the order survey form after they have indicated their shipping address and delivery payment method, as well as added additional items to their order. <br><br><h4>  <b>About 2000 customers have not completed the survey!</b> </h4><br>  If you have not completed the survey, do it as soon as possible, we will not be able to send you a reward until the survey form is completed! <br><br>  If you do not know how to open the survey form, please make a request on our website and we will provide you with your unique survey URL. <br><br><h4>  <b>Where can I order more of your products?</b> </h4><br>  Already, Omega2, Docks and Expansions are available for purchase in the Onion online store, and will soon be sold in Amazon.  At the beginning, not all products will be available, but we will gradually add new ones. <br><br><h4>  <b>But I live outside the United States.</b> </h4><br>  If you live outside the United States and want to order Onion products, we are ready to work with retail stores to make our products available worldwide.  Shops from this list have Omega 2 available and are ready to sell it: <br><br><ul><li>  Free Radical Labs (USA) </li><li>  ABRA Electronics Corp (Canada) </li><li>  Cool Components Ltd (UK) </li><li>  MODMYPI LTD (United Kingdom) </li><li>  IoT Store (Australia) </li><li>  Pakronics (Australia) </li><li>  Paradisetronic.com (Germany) </li><li>  USINA.INFO (Hong Kong) </li><li>  The Engineering Store (India) </li><li>  PotentialLabs (India) </li><li>  Botland SP (Poland) </li><li>  SGBotic Pte Ltd (Singapore) </li><li>  Communica (Pty) Ltd (South Africa) </li><li>  3D Soma (Spain) </li><li>  E-Pulse Servicios de Internet SL (Spain) </li><li>  m punkt nu Sverige AB (Sweden) </li></ul><br>  Now we are ready to work with a large number of sellers, so follow us. <br><br>  <b>Thank.</b> </blockquote><br>  Those who have not ordered a computer I recommend <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/omega2-5-linux-computer-with-wi-fi-made-for-iot/x/16497907">to hurry with this</a> , because  then I may have problems with delivery to Russia, as we see, in this list there are no sellers from Russia. <br><br>  But let's hope they appear soon.  When you try to make an order in the <a href="https://onion.io/">online store Onion</a> , information appears that there are no affordable ways to deliver to Russia.  As an option, it will be possible to buy through Amazon (with delivery on the drone), but who knows what price there will be, and will it be taken to Russia? <br><br>  To be honest, I learned about the survey only from this letter.  Now I wrote in Onion, waiting for them to send a unique link to the survey. <br><br>  If you go to the online store Onion, then you will notice that there the basic version of Omega 2 is sold not for 5, but for 6 dollars.  Although of course it is clear that the price of $ 5 is lower than the self-sufficiency of this product, plus another shipping price.  There is certainly a chance that the product should pay off due to the overpriced price of the Dock station, but not everyone buys it (the complete set without the station was bought 4 times more than with it).  Most likely, therefore, components were chosen that consume a relatively non-standard voltage of 3.3V (it‚Äôs about power, not logical levels), so it‚Äôs not going to power such a device from the charger.  Here you need to connect a stabilizer or use a computer power supply.  Well, or, of course, buy a docking station, which the seller is counting on (a ride on an elephant is free, but you have to pay to get off). <br><br>  That's all.  As soon as I get Omega 2, I will try to write a review about how it all works, and whether it is possible to run it at home without a docking station. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403403/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403403/</a></p>
