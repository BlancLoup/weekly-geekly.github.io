I didn‚Äôt know where to write better, so I decided to write to Startups, because my idea is essentially a startup aimed at a slightly different ‚Äúprofit‚Äù, namely, moral pleasure from good deeds :) <br><br>  In general, after reading an interesting diary of a former orphanage, I thought about how to help children from orphanages by applying modern technologies, or rather, the Internet. <br>  I had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a project that could help such children both in development, both materially and simply morally - letting them know that they are not unnecessary.  That ‚Äúthere‚Äù, behind the fence there are many people who care and who do not look at them askew because they are short-haired and dressed terribly. <br>  But let's omit the lyrics and move on to the problem and its solution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The problem is that among ordinary people, the number of really helping people is negligible.  And the reason is very banal - lack of time.  Sometimes there is not enough time even for their children / brothers / sisters, not to mention the fact that somewhere there are poor children far away who, in principle, can and should be helped at least occasionally, but so lazy to look for an orphanage to go there , find out what's what, how to control whether your money has gone to the new director's car ... <br>  But the Internet is not only for social networks and online games! <br><br>  I propose to engage in joint development of a project aimed at simplifying assistance to children who have no one. <br>  This may be the site on which pages of orphanages will be placed with children's forms. <br>  On these pages, children will be able to share (through the ‚Äúcurator‚Äù of the volunteer, for example) their desires, achievements, creativity, and so on.  Any user of the site will be able to buy the child what he wants. <br>  You can buy some creative things made by children. <br>  You can subscribe and follow a specific child, helping him from time to time, for example, buying textbooks, or helping him develop in that he is doing well. <br>  You can organize a collection of donations in favor of the whole house at once. <br>  On this site must be accounts for curators / managers - call it what you want.  These are people who help the site, visiting orphanages, making photo reports on the use of the collected money, filling in the forms of children and so on. <br>  You can come up with a lot of things - various contests with subsequent video and photo reports, top teachers for children's reviews and so on.

      I hope there will be those who wish, we will plan and jointly launch such a project. <br>  If you do not have the opportunity to participate in the development, but you can help with ideas, in organizational matters or in some other way - write to comments, we will discuss. <br><br>  UPDATES: Google group created: <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/helpthechildren/topics%3Fhl%3Dru">groups.google.com/group/helpthechildren/topics?hl=en</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122110/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122110/</a></p>
