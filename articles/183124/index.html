  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Using Ivideon? Want to get on TV? Then we go to you!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/531/4a3/fd9/5314a3fd91a7b04007543e8b6ff61c63.jpg"><br><br>  We are very proud that Ivideon is the most popular cloud surveillance service in the world.  Since the beginning of this year, we have been processing more hours of incoming video than, for example, Youtube.  Now, on average, video from more than 12,000 cameras is being written to our data centers at the same time.  It seems to be not very impressive.  In fact, it‚Äôs already about 200 hours of video per minute.  Whereas Youtube officially speaks of only 100 hours over the same period of time. <br><br>  But be that as it may, the Ivideon blog on our site is significantly less popular than the Ivideon blog on Habr√©.  Therefore, today we decided to publish our rather unusual request here.  The fact is that yesterday we received a call from the NTV channel and we really need your help! <br><a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      We are trying very hard to provide a substantial part of our capabilities completely free of charge for those who need to connect only one or two cameras.  And for most who use our home service, this is more than enough. <br><br>  A quality product, free options and our users talk about us, bring other users and we are developing even faster than expected from the very beginning. <br><br>  And as an interim result, yesterday they called us from the NTV channel and said that they would very much like to make a story about Ivideon for the transfer of science and technology. <br>  But in our opinion, as creators of Ivideon, it will be wrong for us to talk about our product.  It will naturally look like an advertisement.  And we really would not want this. <br><br>  And we decided that it would be very great to find independent people who would like to tell journalists about how they use our service.  How does he help in everyday life?  What tasks are solved?  Were there any interesting cases related to the use of Ivideon?  Maybe you launched your own project, a part of which was our solution?  If yes, then it is very cool!  Do not hesitate - tell us about your project too! <br>  Or do you have a child who is already old enough to stay at home alone, but not old enough not to check at all what he does in your absence?  I think, and you can tell about it! <br>  Are you trying to document a poltergeist or a ghost? <br><br>  In general, if you have thoughts, ideas, and most importantly a desire to help us, we will be happy to hear about your suggestions.  You can write both in the comments and in lichku. <br>  Or through the <a href="http://ru.ivideon.com/contacty/">feedback form on our website</a> . <br><br>  And, by the way, it doesn't matter what camera you use.  Expensive IP or webcam built into the laptop. <br><br>  In any case, thank you very much for being with us and for your support! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183124/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183124/</a></p>
