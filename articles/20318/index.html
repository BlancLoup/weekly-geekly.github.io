  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The effect of CNN 2 - Mobile eyes of society</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>“The effect of CNN 2 - Mobile eyes of society”</strong> We live in a striking society.  In a society in which the image is more important than its essence.  In a society in which the picture before our eyes, or rather the video series models our life reality ... The term “CNN effect” dates back to 1991, from the moment the satellite television channel CNN demonstrated “war on the air” to the entire globe. The moment is important for the subsequent analysis not at all because the technology has reached its apogee and now the news comes “from around the globe” - namely, that at this moment we lost the possibility of trust in the media, and the concept of format - “ <strong><em>Is it possible that we see "?</em></strong> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce6/8dc/3e1/ce68dc3e1627f3929bdf652318a46c89.jpg" alt=" CNN ,  " width="267" height="238" title="undefined">  In this case, the global satellite channel carried its “message” to us: The war (event) is realIt is real because you can watch itIt is real, because we broadcast live video from all over the world, how can it not be real? <strong>All that we show is TRUE</strong> : “The effect of CNN” is a shift in the assessment of what is happening - understanding - the concept of events, after (when) showing them “in real time” key satellites channels.  At the time of the demonstration of what is happening - a person, society, elites, decision makers, receive some kind of message (including the state level, such as declaring war, terror, etc.) after which they (officials) should immediately respond (maybe on the air satellite channel) and express the official position of the institution they represent.  Formally speaking, all the major, major events taking place on a global scale, now 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, are media events that require (for the protection of institutional interests) an immediate reaction. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2dd/354/b11/2dd354b112648ba3abbd147a2f6e5b32.jpg" alt="real time coverage, cnn effect, cnn" width="467" height="358" title="undefined">  And here we come to the main cultural and the question “Is the reality that we demonstrate through these channels the most relative and present?” Is it possible that a dozen transnational (or national) round-the-clock media delivery channels form (by selecting media events, by choice of the method of submission and evaluation) our reality and the policies of the states? It is clear that the CNN channel and the Al-Arabia channel have opposite political guidelines and methods of presenting events, however, by combining their views we are unlikely  we will get a real map of the world .... The development of technology and communication channels has led to the fact that now anyone having a mobile camera in their phone becomes a “broadcaster” and a “new mobile eye” of what is happening ..... The place of one global able News Network - we are awaiting the creation of a (possibly public) Mobile Wirelees News Network.  The analogue of one common channel is a multitude of different voices available “on demand”, broadcasting the events taking place on the air. Similar projects are already growing like mushrooms after the August rain!  This raises several global cultural issues.  Who owns the right to broadcast what a person “sees” in front of himself? Is it possible to limit an individual in his right to send a video signal around the world? And if it is possible, is there moral and legal grounds for this? Will an individual follow these rules? After all, as the experience of the blogosphere “ritual” and the legal restriction does not lead to the desired results, it showed?  As it was then, and now the creation (namely broadcasting) of the Internet channel was not regulated by any legislative acts, the question about “pirated” and “not pirated” was not even worth it. The technical part consisted of two servers, one of which was staffed with the “AKULA” format "(And in the case of money falling on the head, TOAST IT!), The second is responsible for owning subscribers <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ac/f5f/31c/6acf5f31c4e742291f58b292aae1cc28.jpg" width="450" height="397" title="undefined">  Then a global wi-fi network was not deployed around the city, which would allow sending a “video stream” to the server from an actual event ... There were only a couple of points, and limited Internet channels.  Therefore, the idea of ​​online broadcasting concerts, rallies, events looked extremely attractive. However, the main essence of the project was simple: TV production, television broadcasting, live event transmission has ceased to be available to the central media facilities, its cost is the cost of a laptop camera and servers.  Or at the very least a laptop with an integrated camera.  Democratization of broadcasting began the day before yesterday! Now everyone who mastered After Effects, who understood the performance of broadcasting technologies, could become a “civilian journalist” - broadcasting his opinion from a laptop and a camera at the wireless coverage point. I’m not talking about video content storage servers YOUTUBE, about UserGeneratedContent, about WHAT is the collection of videos on these sites, and about what and how these phenomena have become, I’m talking about creating an “alternative” to the existing broadcast media.  zhnoy by the development of video compression technologies, thanks to the development of mobile technology and civil samosoznaniya.Na Currently there are several projects of "on-line" broadcast control studios.  They allow to solve the most important costly issue of the broadcast technology - flow and content management. They allow to unite the efforts of “laptop journalists” located in different parts of the world where there is one important condition - NET.And broadcast their opinion - surely that in a state where the possibility of a citizen to get a loan for a crisp new Opel Corsa - much higher than the level of his self-awareness and the opportunity to express his protest will not lead to any changes in public and political life.  But in other regions, thousands and thousands of “mobile eyes” forming total chaotic noise have become a strategic threat to the global media world - and there will no longer be an opportunity to hide the truth behind the “veil” of editorial policy.  Thousands of people have the opportunity to show the world the footage from the 1st row of the Formula-1 Grand Prix ... Thousands of people who have the opportunity to instantly send “their eyes” from the next rally to the MIRTs Thousands of people are now the same equal participants of world media noise as the first reporters CNN abandoned in the heart of a theater of war with a single satellite modem.  Now they are all - the threat of a 60-year-old monopoly of large corporations, and state entities to the “truth live”. Because the monopoly on the truth suddenly crumbled - leaving each individual to define this complex concept for themselves. everyone.She.Svoya <br>  <a href="http://blog.viraltrends.ru/%3Fp%3D5">original</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d06/3aa/c3d/d063aac3dc24a88d335c4ef02048580e.jpg" width="240" height="180" title="undefined"><br><br></div>
