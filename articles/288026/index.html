Now there will be published lists of ringtones, which you can download from the site "Computer News".  To argue with the editor is not to get a salary (especially since I also think that ringtones are more important).  Here are the tunes we offer you today: <br><br>  I'll start with the life-affirming blog " <a href="http://oafinacar.blogspot.com/"><b>Schmuck in cars</b></a> ".  I will not give links to specific articles, this blog will amuse you entirely.  I think the meaning is clear from the name - pedestrians and other ‚Äúhorseless‚Äù people are fighting rudeness of car drivers.

      Another blog, which I advise you to view in its entirety (especially since it has not been updated since mid-November) - ‚Äú <a href="http://railclub.ru/blog"><b>Railway Journal</b></a> ‚Äù.  All on the railway topics fascinating blog language. <br><br>  The blog " <a href="http://itblogs.ru/blogs/moochnick/default.aspx"><b>Software Sales and Marketing</b></a> " is noted in our review with " <a href="http://itblogs.ru/blogs/moochnick/archive/2005/12/07/3448.aspx">Tireless Google</a> ".  An interesting and detailed article about the new service "Google" - base.google.com. <br><br>  ‚Äú <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/"><b>Manic Weblog</b></a> ‚Äù is outraged that Russian-speaking communities of web developers do not want to understand the essence of the issues and almost always advise utter nonsense.  For example, " <i>you must write in XHTML, not in HTML</i> ."  And the article tells us that " <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/2005/12/19">... technically no XHTML exists in the modern web</a> ." <br><br>  " <a href="http://web-blog.ru/"><b>Internet Marketing Blog</b></a> " tells us stories.  More precisely, just one fairy tale - ‚ÄúThe <a href="http://web-blog.ru/2005/12/14/skazka">Tale of Yandex Robots</a> ‚Äù.  After that, not letting us come to our senses, talks about the usefulness / irrelevance of certain <a href="http://web-blog.ru/2005/12/16/meta-tags">meta tags</a> .  Oh, how many of these arguments have already been, and meta tags continue to parasitize on juicy carcass sites. <br><br>  Comrade <a href="http://merkurov.ru/blog/"><b>Merkurov</b></a> condemns all opponents of the <a href="http://merkurov.ru/blog/2005/12/16/519">free copying of</a> audio-video files and argues for the free distribution of media that he has endured.  I totally agree with him!  You also need to distribute bread for free and, finally, introduce communism on the entire planet. <br><br>  Many people (I among them) have a problem with the daily routine.  This is especially true of bedtime.  <a href="http://kolesnik.ru/"><b>Kolesnik</b></a> to help us publishes a note " <a href="http://kolesnik.ru/2005/ayurveda-winter">Winter daily routine for Ayurveda</a> ."  I was still too lazy to understand, because Ayurverda is such an ancient Indian philosophical-medical system and there are many magic words in the text that confuse me. <br><br>  <a href="http://setti.biz/"><b>Setti.biz</b></a> gives us " <a href="http://setti.biz/308">5 reasons for starting a business</a> ", otherwise we cannot find a reason to persuade ourselves to invest extra money (extra? Send all extra money to me!).  Moreover, in addition to five reasons, three questions are also asked (almost rhetorical, almost about the meaning of life). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.sellme.ru/"><b>Sell ‚Äã‚ÄãMe</b></a> offers seven tips <a href="http://www.sellme.ru/2005/12/10/10_ways_to_improve_your_english">for improving</a> your (and mine, of course) English skills.  Nothing super-original, but for some, these tips can be the impetus for action. <br><br>  <a href="http://gordy.ru/"><b>Gordy</b></a> returned from his trip to England after the tour The Prodigy, but continues to share with us his impressions of this country.  First of all, <a href="http://gordy.ru/archives/62">Amazing Britain</a> , a few things that surprised him.  Secondly, " <a href="http://gordy.ru/archives/68">Clubs of Britain</a> " - an article about the zoos of this country.  Just kidding, of course.  In fact, about vegetable shops. <br><br>  <a href="http://evilbot.ru/"><b>EvilBot</b></a> helps us understand licenses to use <a href="http://evilbot.ru/article/99">open source</a> code for software. <br><br>  The <a href="http://mastertext.spb.ru/blog/"><b>AD_BLOG</b></a> advertising <a href="http://mastertext.spb.ru/blog/"><b>blog</b></a> this week caught the attention by two reflective notes.  " <a href="http://mastertext.spb.ru/blog/2005/12/07">Festival works - is there any use?</a> " And " <a href="http://mastertext.spb.ru/blog/2005/12/11">Brand for a while</a> ."  The last article is about how some transnational corporations allow outsiders to use their brand and what comes of it. <br><br>  An interesting article " <a href="http://blog.redgraphic.ru/kruglov/08-12-05_303">Seriously: about the rising frames</a> " appeared in the corporate blog of one Minsk design firm.  Skeptical attitude to the recruitment of full-time students.  The name of the company does not indicate that students do not find out the address and did not arrange the last day of Pompeii. <br><br>  <a href="http://monster-girl.com/"><b>Monster-Girl</b></a> nostalgic for the old games, and then downloads them and plays.  Naturally, he <a href="http://monster-girl.com/%3Fp%3D70">shares</a> his impressions <a href="http://monster-girl.com/%3Fp%3D70">with us</a> on the blog.  Five mini-reviews of games released from 1991 to 1995. <br><br>  <a href="http://hvost.org/"><b>HvosT</b></a> talks about " <a href="http://hvost.org/%3Fp%3D149">scam on the web</a> ."  I‚Äôd better quote: " <i>A special category of illegal methods is the scam, which is also divided into components. The scam on the Internet also has a lot of schemes and constantly evolving technologies</i> ." <br><br>  <a href="http://jamshid.ru/"><b>Jamshid</b></a> instantly responded to the appearance of the tariffs of the third telephone operator of Belarus in his article ‚Äú <a href="http://jamshid.ru/2005/12/19">Soundless Tariffs</a> ‚Äù.  Jamshid works for a competing operator and enjoys the rival's misadventures. <br><br>  <a href="http://kastorka.com/"><b>Castorca</b></a> shares with us the shocking news - the company Procter &amp; Gamble has taken a strange advertising move: having bought hygienic tampons from this company, you can create <a href="http://kastorka.com/archives/2005/12/15/303">your own ringtone</a> . <br><br>  Surprisingly, global companies will not agree on a uniform ringtone format.  So you have to download your ringtones for each model.  In the next section - polyphony for LJ phones. <br><br>  A girl with her friend Marat (a former Minsk resident) visited Minsk and had so many impressions that she wrote a <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/nutly/69715.html">large report</a> on this trip with pictures.  A curious look at our realities through the eyes of an unbiased person.  Of course, for her, and "funny language", and "bas-reliefs of people with ant faces," but from the side, as they say, always know better. <br><br>  Continuing the theme of Minsk, I again send you to the community of this city (well, how much can you ?!).  This time there are discussed the features of the <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/minsk_by/696181.html">Belarusian service sector</a> .  Funny listing of these features, for example: "The <i>waiter will patiently stand over you and repeat" No "as you go through all the menu items in a row, instead of simply making public the two dishes that the kitchen prepares today</i> ." <br><br>  Well, what am I all about the blue-eyed Belarus?  We have a mighty altruist neighbor at our side, supplying us with oil for almost free of charge (I wink at Ukrainians).  Yeah, Russia.  So, in the diary of the notorious <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/doctor_livsy/"><b>Sergei Lukyanenko</b></a> (namely ‚ÄúThe Night Watch‚Äù), you can <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/doctor_livsy/110708.html">read a quotation</a> from the ‚ÄúDiary of a Writer‚Äù by Fyodor Mikhailovich ‚Äúour everything‚Äù by Dostoevsky.  Despite the fact that the lines were written back in 1877, they are still relevant today.  F.M.  It proves to us that: " <i>... Russia will not have, and never have been, such haters, envious, slanderers, and even obvious enemies, like all these Slavic tribes</i> ." <br><br>  You can search for the meaning of life, you can search for alcoholic beverages on the red day of the calendar, but the next author looked for and found the flaws of " <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/ivan_da_marya/303432.html">Women's Prose</a> ."  Now he teaches us how to instantly define this most feminine prose and avoid it.  Unfortunately, I can not give you a final quote from there, because self-censorship does not let through. <br><br>  A short story about how <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/frumich/94894.html">Konstantin Ernst got into a taxi</a> .  I really want the events of this story really ever happen in reality. <br><br>  An interesting magazine of a girl hiding behind the pseudonym sobe_panek.  Interesting this LJ, first of all, stories.  For reference, I recommend " <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/sobe_panek/13995.html">About Mice and People</a> ."  Naturally, to define a quote to you: "The <i>cat first takes them to the bathroom, plays with them there. It is convenient to play in the bathroom - the mouse cannot escape anywhere, the walls are slippery!</i> " <br><br>  And now the question for connoisseurs: " <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/76_82/1607295.html">What kind of girl is depicted in the photo?</a> ".  I am sure that all of you saw her in the Soviet film, only there she was shot as a girl.  And immediately there is no, this is not Alice Selezneva.  Before you look at the comments that already have the correct answer, think for yourself.  Nostalgia.  Answer - Alexander Druz. <br><br>  Ringtones - evil, mobile phones enslave humanity!  But aggregators - no.  Therefore, use aggregators! <br><br>  <b>Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <i><b>From the editor:</b> considering the results of our recent dispute with Alexey Khaletsky about the sense of humor among the readers, I consider it appropriate to emphasize the presence of this very humor in the first paragraph of the review.</i>  <i>For those who are not born to be a miner and are too lazy to dig deeply, I also note that this does not exclude the presence of him (humor) and further in the text.</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2005510603.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 51, 2005)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288026/</a></p>
