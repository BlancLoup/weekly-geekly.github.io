That's just start a separate device solely for shooting video, many may seem inconvenient.  Can a modern camera replace a video camera? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Cameras vs video cameras </h4><br>  Let's agree: we will only compare devices that are close in price and are not oriented towards professional use. <br><br>  If you have already tried to compare video taken with a camera and a video camera of about the same price category, then you probably noticed an amazing feature: the camera shoots video much better. <br><br>  On the technical side, everything is simple: the main parameter affecting the quality of the picture is the size of the sensor.  And digital cameras have a much larger sensor than camcorders.

      Does this mean that the choice is obvious?  Not.  In addition to the quality of the picture there are many pitfalls that should be remembered before buying. <br><br>  <b>Image quality.</b>  With this point, we almost figured out.  The quality of the video camera images are inferior to cameras.  This is especially noticeable in low light conditions, for example, in rooms.  The vast majority of soap dishes have a matrix with a diagonal of 1 / 2.3 ". The sensors of entry-level cameras are much more modest: from 1/6" to 1/3 ". <br><br>  <b>Ergonomics.</b>  Everything is more complicated here.  The camera has to be held with two hands in front of you, and the video camera with one arm bent at the elbow.  Contrary to popular belief, this does not reduce shaking, but allows you to shoot much longer, because your hands get tired less.  Using a tripod eliminates this difference.  In addition, almost all camcorders are equipped with a swivel display, which greatly simplifies shooting from non-standard angles.  You should also mention additional buttons that allow you to more flexibly control the process of video recording.  Cameras also have buttons for quick access to the main functions, but they are focused (surprise!) On photography. <br><br>  <b>Settings.</b>  Camcorders can boast a large number of settings: from bit rate and aspect ratio to sound quality.  Soap boxes often allow you to select only the frame size, sometimes - the bitrate.  On the other hand, SLRs and mirrorless ones offer wider possibilities for controlling the image: almost the same ones that are used during photography. <br><br>  <b>Sound.</b>  Typically, video cameras are equipped with higher-quality and functional microphones, sometimes even with the ability to record five-channel sound.  More expensive models of video and cameras have a connector for an external microphone, which equalizes their capabilities. <br><br>  <b>Zoom</b>  When compared with cameras, all video cameras can be classified as ultrazoom.  At the same time, the zoom control is much more flexible for them, the zoom speed depends on the strength of pressing the lever, the sound of the drive is almost never heard on the recording.  Cameras cannot boast of such comforts.  If the drive is electric, the sound of the zoom is often distinguishable on the recording.  Apparently, therefore, some cameras do not allow to use it during video filming.  And if the zoom is mechanical, then it is most often impossible to use it when recording: it is very difficult to turn the ring smoothly and it is absolutely impossible to do it continuously.  The situation is radically changed with the acquisition of a special lens for video, which, however, is worth a fortune. <br><br>  <b>Stabilization.</b>  When shooting with hands, stabilization is vital, unless the goal is to get a blurry and jumping image.  Most cheap cameras are equipped with electronic stabilization, which eliminates jitter, but does not prevent blur.  In more expensive models, optical stabilization. <br><br>  <b>Recording time</b>  Cameras have an unpleasant limitation: the video shooting time in HD mode does not exceed 30 minutes in order not to overlap with the class of video cameras and to avoid additional taxation.  For some cameras, there are hacker firmware that removes this restriction.  All types of cameras are also affected by the maximum file size limit in FAT32.  But if most cameras simply stop recording when the file size reaches 4 GB, then the cameras create a new file without interrupting the recording.  An additional source of problems can be a large sensor: during long-term video filming, it overheats, and recording stops.  This problem is observed in most DSLRs and mirrorless mirrors (but not in soap cases), for example, in the entire Sony Nex model range. <br><br>  <b>Equipment.</b>  Most camcorders are equipped with a network adapter, which is very useful during long-term video shooting.  For the camera you have to buy it separately. <br><br>  <b>File format</b>  Photos and video cameras can use different codecs to compress the footage.  The processor power is very important here: with the same bit rate, the video can have different quality depending on the applied codec and compression algorithms.  Often in cheap cameras the lack of processor power is compensated by a huge bit rate. <br><br><h4>  What to choose? </h4><br>  If you choose a device for shooting video, then you probably already know how you will use it. <br><br>  Video can be divided into two main types. <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Reporting.</b>  Weddings, feasts, matinees, concerts, reports - in one word everything that can not be repeated.  Usually does not require too high quality, here the continuity and convenience of shooting are more important.  Often takes place in rooms with poor lighting. </li><li>  <b>Staged or artistic.</b>  Shooting according to the scenario in in advance known or prepared conditions.  This is how commercials, clips, author films are made.  Since the conditions and plot of the shooting are determined by the operator, it can be repeated until everything is done in the best possible way.  For this, high quality and the ability to manually adjust everything and everything is important.  Continuous shooting time usually does not exceed several minutes. </li></ol><br><br>  Video cameras and cameras-soap boxes are best suited for reportage photography (if they are satisfied with the thirty-minute time limit for shooting).  Cameras have better picture quality, and camcorders are more convenient.  But they both badly removed in dim lighting.  Therefore, if the budget allows, you can look at the mirrorless cameras that shoot video with the quality of DSLRs, but at the same time are close to soap dishes for ease of use.  Panasonic's mirrorless cameras generally behave like video cameras: they lack all the limitations on continuous shooting time, and if there is, they are easily removed by hacker firmware. <br><br>  For artistic or staged shooting, the quality of soap dishes is clearly not enough, and serious video cameras are prohibitively expensive.  Therefore, the best option would be a SLR or mirrorless.  There is practically no difference between SLRs and mirrorless just in terms of video recording, so it‚Äôs worth choosing based on the available budget and functional needs. <br><br><h4>  Examples </h4><br>  Let's see what video shooting looks like on the example of several specific camera models. <br><br>  <b>The Canon SX130 IS</b> is a very functional and inexpensive camera soap dish.  Shoots video in HD 720p: 1280x720, 30 frames per second, H.264 codec.  It has a twelve-fold zoom and optical stabilizer - it would seem, everything that you may need to shoot video. <br><br>  But this is if you read the characteristics.  In practice, everything is not so rosy.  Due to a weak processor that cannot provide high compression with acceptable picture quality, the bit rate is exorbitantly inflated - up to 25 megabits per second.  This leads to the fact that after 15 minutes the file size reaches 4 GB and the shooting stops. <br><br>  In addition, recording a large amount of data on a memory card consumes a lot of energy, and since the camera is powered by two finger batteries, it takes them very briefly. <br><br>  Very annoying autofocus work.  The camera often refocuses even when it is not needed at all. <br><br>  The advantages include good stabilizer performance, decent sound quality, twelve-fold zoom and pocket size. <br><br>  <b>Sony DSC-HX1</b> is a rather weighty and expensive ultrazoom soap dish.  Shoots video in HDV 1080p: 1440x1080, 30 frames per second, H.264 codec.  Twenty-fold zoom, optical stabilizer, folding display (can be turned up and down).  I would like, of course, to be able to twist it in all directions, but this is already very good. <br><br>  The camera is pleased with the high quality of everything and everyone (within reasonable limits, of course).  Perfectly shoots video, rarely misses with autofocus, the quality and detail of the picture in good light pleases the eye.  When shooting indoors, noise in dark areas is clearly distinguishable.  A powerful processor compresses video up to 8 or 12 megabits per second to choose from.  At the same time, the picture quality even with a lower bit rate is much higher than that of the Canon SX130 IS and is quite acceptable for viewing, but it may not be enough for editing.  The quality of the microphone is somewhat distressing: the lower part of the sound range is almost completely cut off. <br><br>  If continuous recording time in this camera were not limited to thirty minutes, it could be called the best choice for sequential shooting, when quality requirements are not too high. <br><br>  <b>Panasonic Lumix GF2</b> - mirrorless with 4/3 "matrix size and touch screen. Shoots video in Full-HD 1080i: 1920x1080, 50/60 frames per second, H.264 codec. Zoom and stabilization are determined by the lens used. Whale 14-42 provides optical stabilization and triple zoom. <br><br>  Using the zoom during video shooting is almost impossible, and such a function is needed during sequential shooting.  When the zoom ring is rotated, the camera is difficult to hold still, and the sound is too distinct.  Special lenses for shooting video give much more opportunities, but they cost several times more than the camera itself. <br><br>  But the video quality in low light is much better than the models described above.  In addition, the camera allows you to control most of the shooting parameters: ISO, shutter speed, aperture, etc. <br><br>  There is also a fully automatic mode in which it is almost as easy to control the camera as a soap box.  But still mirrorless requires more skill and attention from the user.  For example, because of a shallower depth of field, autofocus misses (and they are not uncommon, even if autofocus is on) is much more noticeable, so in many cases it is more efficient to use manual focusing. <br><br>  The camera records stereo sound of acceptable quality.  But very noisy in the wind.  If necessary, you can use an external microphone. <br><br>  For this camera, as for most models of this line, there is an unofficial patch that removes many restrictions.  For example, it can be used to remove the thirty-minute limit for continuous recording or set the desired video bitrate. <br><br>  <b>Nikon D5100</b> - SLR camera with a matrix of 23.6x15.6 mm and a rotatable display.  Shoots video in Full-HD 1080p: 1920x1080, 25/30 frames per second, H.264 codec. <br><br>  The sensitivity of the matrix of this camera is enough even for evening shooting with a decent quality.  But the sound is not its strongest side, which, however, is easily compensated by an external microphone. <br><br>  The camera has a tracking autofocus, but its quality also leaves much to be desired.  If shooting conditions allow, manual focusing is preferable.  In addition, the focusing sound is often heard in the recording. <br><br>  For reportage photography, the device is unlikely to be suitable due to the twenty-minute limit on continuous shooting.  In rare cases, shooting may be stopped earlier because of overheating of the matrix. <br><br>  But the camera can be used for artistic shooting.  But the maximum video bitrate is only 18 megabits per second, which may seem a little to many to edit. <br><br><h4>  Useful tips </h4><br><ul><li>  Try to choose a camera that supports video recording at a frame rate of a multiple of the AC frequency in the power grid.  Simply put, for shooting in Russia or Ukraine, cameras that shoot video at a frequency of 25 or 50 frames per second are better suited. </li><li>  If the budget does not allow you to purchase the desired model of camera or lens, look for them on the free ad sites.  It's amazing how much cheaper cameras, having lost the raid of novelty. </li><li>  The tripod not only solves the problem of shaking, but also allows you to overlook the many shortcomings of the camera: inconvenient ergonomics, large mass, noisy stabilizer or the lack of it. </li><li>  The larger the zoom, the less light gets into the lens.  In low light, try to shoot at minimum zoom, this will reduce the noise in the picture. </li><li>  If the video is shot mostly ‚Äúfor history‚Äù and editing is not foreseen, choose a camera that records video with a small bitrate.  Otherwise, you will have to spend money on a new hard drive. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153393/</a></p>
