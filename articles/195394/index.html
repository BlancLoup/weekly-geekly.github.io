After the release of 3.8 six months have passed and 34786 changes made by 985 participants have been made.  The release includes new features and many minor improvements.  Version 3.10 contains both user interface improvements and new features for application developers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  GNOME 3.10 New Features </h3><br><br>  <strong>Wayland</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/385/e04/953/385e049538f3435bc7643a206a4653fb.png" alt="Wayland" align="right"><br>  Wayland is a new generation of technology for displaying images and processing user input to Linux.  It is designed for smoother graphics and provides a wide range of animation and image conversion.  The modern architecture of Wayland provides significant flexibility for developers and allows you to create more secure isolated applications. <br>  Release 3.10 contains experimental support for Wayland, which allows Wayland to be used both to launch the GNOME environment itself and the applications in it.  This is an important step towards a full transition to Wayland, allowing application developers to start testing applications right now.  More details about Wayland can be read in the notes for developers.

      <strong>Universal system menu</strong> <br><br>  GNOME 3.10 contains an updated system notification menu.  In previous versions, the system area consisted of several menus in the corners of the top panel.  The new system menu replaces them with one single menu.  This allows you to quickly see the status of the device and displays only the information currently needed.  In addition, the new menu has become more convenient when working with the mouse and contains improvements regarding privacy, brightness adjustment and more convenient mode "In the plane." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b14/127/916/b14127916449a1a4157335b7e26fdc15.png" alt="Universal system menu"><br><br>  <strong>Window menu</strong> <br><br>  In GNOME 3.10, a new interface element appeared - the window menu.  It combines the window title and toolbar, leaving more space for the contents of the window.  This allows the application interface to more dynamically adjust to the context, and the close window button is present even if the window is maximized. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdd/eb2/ea4/bddeb2ea4e59ef6ef41ad8ca60aeaad5.png" alt="Window menu"><br><br>  <strong>New applications</strong> <br><br>  GNOME is pursuing its mission of creating a new set of basic applications.  The new version has a whole set of new applications: Music, Photos, Notes, Applications and Maps.  Read more in the New and Updated Applications section below. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c38/461/e25/c38461e25f48f0254e2f86f9c3fc1372.png" alt="New applications"><br><br>  <strong>Applications</strong> <br><br>  In GNOME 3.10, a new application for searching and installing applications appeared, called Applications ( <em>deputy peper</em> - sorry for the tautology).  Applications solve almost all the tasks associated with managing applications - searching, installing and removing applications, as well as viewing and installing updates. <br>  In addition, the Appendices have a Recommendations section and a simple interface that allows you to view the applications available for installation.  In the future, we plan to add user ratings, comments and screenshots. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cba/598/b5a/cba598b5a00f5ad0b9bbf491260f4c3f.png" alt="Applications"><br><br>  <strong>Geolocation</strong> <br><br>  The GNOME 3.10 release includes a new location framework.  It allows you to automatically determine your location using various sources, including your Internet connection and GPS.  The new framework has already found an application to automatically determine the time zone, which allows you to show local time wherever you go.  GNOME 3.10 also includes a new Map application, which also uses positioning. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52e/e08/274/52ee0827473c23b6b8b1cc84dab53ae9.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  New and updated applications </h3><br><br>  GNOME 3.10 contains a number of new applications, such as Music, Photos, Notes and Maps.  Many existing applications were also refined. <br><br>  <strong>Music</strong> <br><br>  We want to make Music the default player in GNOME 3, and in GNOME 3.10 it is released as a preview version.  Music has a simple interface that allows you to browse your collection by artist, album, and record title.  In the future we plan to add support for playing music from media servers (UPnP) and other network sources. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b55/701/4f6/b557014f64956945e1985f3d73e4bdf1.png" alt="Music"><br><br>  <strong>Cards</strong> <br><br>  Maps is a new map viewer in GNOME.  Maps use OpenStreetMap data, filled with hundreds of thousands of people around the world.  Both schematic map and satellite are supported.  The application allows you to search for cities, attractions and places.  Maps use a new geolocation framework, introduced in release 3.10. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52e/e08/274/52ee0827473c23b6b8b1cc84dab53ae9.png" alt="Cards"><br><br>  <strong>Photo</strong> <br><br>  Photos is a new application introduced in GNOME 3.8.  Since then, it has been refined and included in the standard application package.  Photos allow you to view, sort and print images, and integrate with network services.  Support for the Flickr service is already available in the application; work on supporting other services has not yet been completed.  In addition, the application allows you to send images for viewing on other devices, such as TVs and phones with DLNA support or other computers using GNOME. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c31/d35/0cb/c31d350cbf47d8450bbc2d7b4ef6fbdc.png" alt="Photo"><br><br>  <strong>Notes</strong> <br><br>  Notes first appeared in GNOME 3.8 called Bijiben.  Since then, they have acquired new features, including synchronization with ownCloud.  Notes provide the user with a simple interface to record, view and search notes, and automatically save them, so you don‚Äôt lose anything even if you close the application. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b54/40a/c1a/b5440ac1a2f1105b9cbac5e062ccef30.png" alt="Notes"><br><br>  <strong>Clock</strong> <br><br>  In this release, the stopwatch and timer received a visual representation, as well as support for automatic detection of local time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21c/33c/e1d/21c33ce1da724d4d91c682b7588103b4.png" alt="Clock"><br><br>  <strong>Settings</strong> <br><br>  In release 3.10, the Settings have been completely redesigned.  The settings were divided into groups for ease of searching, and explanations have become easier and more understandable to them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/991/8db/797/9918db797be17cc922b28b83f4b8cdf4.png" alt="Settings"><br><br>  <strong>the Internet</strong> <br><br>  The Internet browser has been enhanced in release 3.10.  Like all standard applications, its title and toolbar were merged into one panel, which allowed more space to be used for browsing.  The Internet is also integrated into the system search, so you can search among the browsing history and open tabs directly from the GNOME main menu.  To preserve privacy, the default search engine has been changed to DuckDuckGo. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6be/a10/f96/6bea10f96daf1c091bb5c4392b939884.png" alt="the Internet"><br><br>  <strong>Other changes</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  Boxes now supports importing disk images, including QEMU (.cow, .qcow and .qcow2), binary images (.img), VirtualBox 1.1 (.vdi), VMWare 3 and 4 (.vmdk), VirtualPC (.vpc) and Linux Compressed Loop images (.cloop).  Also in release 3.10, the interface was slightly modified. </li><li>  Documents have the ability to view and open documents stored in ownCloud. </li><li>  Contacts also received an updated interface, including a new contact list, contact pane, and new dialogs for merging contacts and changing the address book. </li><li>  Document viewing now supports the DjVu format, and the search results panel has also been updated.  In this release, the long-awaited cursor in PDF documents and keyboard navigation appeared.  This allows you to position the selection cursor and move it using the keyboard.  The selection mode is activated by pressing F7.  Work on these features was funded by the Friends of GNOME campaign. </li><li>  In Boxes, drag'n'drop support by the host and virtual machine appeared.  This option is available for all new virtual machines created through the installation wizard.  For old virtual machines and those created not through the master, the spice-vdagent package is required, Microsoft Windows virtual machines need the spice-guest-tools package. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Updated GNOME 3 Interface </h3><br><br>  In addition to the above, GNOME 3.10 includes several other new features and interface improvements. <br><br>  <strong>Paging applications</strong> <br><br>  Now the application launch menu instead of vertical scrolling uses page scrolling, and also contains minor changes in appearance and animation.  Pages allow you to quickly find applications.  In addition, applications can now be combined into directories.  We spent a lot of time to make this part of the interface more convenient and more beautiful. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/658/761/f8d/658761f8dd25fe6134cbddfe57dab809.png" alt="Paging applications"><br><br>  <strong>Customizable lock screen background</strong> <br><br>  Starting with version 3.10, it is possible to install your own image.  This expands the interface settings and allows you to distinguish the lock screen from your session.  The background of the lock screen can be changed in the desktop background settings. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e2/40e/e8f/8e240ee8ffb56fc9b7833b89d0ddfb43.png" alt="Customizable lock screen background"><br><br>  <strong>Precise scrolling</strong> <br><br>  Gnome scrollbars have got a new mode of precise scrolling.  This allows scrolling content with a small step, which can be useful when scrolling a large number of elements.  To activate the exact scrolling mode, click on the slider and hold the mouse button or click while holding the Shift key. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/972/ca3/83d/972ca383ddd41983db2653070aa7baf9.png" alt="Precision scrolling"><br><br>  <strong>Settings</strong> <br><br>  Since the last release in the Settings application, several sections have changed at once. <br><ul><li>  <strong>Date and time</strong> : this section has been completely redesigned to provide users with a simpler interface, with an enlarged and improved time zone map and clear settings.  There was an autotune time option using the new geolocation framework. </li><li>  <strong>Screen</strong> : this section has also been redone, making the setup process a little easier. </li><li>  <strong>Desktop background</strong> : in addition to the lock screen settings, it became possible to select images from a Flickr account. </li><li>  <strong>Accounts</strong> : Network accounts are now integrated with messaging networks and are available in one place.  Added support for Google two-factor authentication and Flickr service. </li><li>  <strong>Special features</strong> : special features are now combined into one page.  This allows you to quickly find the desired settings. </li><li>  <strong>Desktop background</strong> : in addition to the lock screen settings, it became possible to select images from a Flickr account. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1e/e03/1df/e1ee031df8e0734d93a51ee2374b4a0d.png" alt="Settings"><br><br>  <strong>Pleasant and legible text</strong> <br><br>  Cantarell, the official font, received a significant update in release 3.10.  Added symbols for multiple languages, bends and indents for existing languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave been improved.  As a result, the font turned out nicer and more readable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12a/fc1/2a3/12afc12a3868c8677ddf8aa7fc871940.png" alt="Pleasant and legible text"><br><br>  <strong>High Definition Screen Support</strong> <br><br>  High definition screens are becoming popular.  GNOME 3.10 has added support for such screens, and now the content will automatically scale to compensate for the increased resolution.  This means that the controls and content will be displayed in the right size and the interface will look familiar.  This piece of work would not have been done without support from Brion Vibber and Intel Open Technology Technology Center (OTC) in the form of laptops with high-definition screens. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e76/018/d33/e76018d338eddf57b2167abdb64c416b.png" alt="High Definition Screen Support"><br><br>  <strong>Smart card support</strong> <br><br>  Now smart cards can be used to authorize and unlock.  Taking into account the interests of corporate users, smart cards can be configured as the main authorization method, and login using a password can be disabled.  It is also possible to lock the screen or end the session when the smart card is disconnected. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f22/c37/61f/f22c3761f91557039d04c15d66d30afd.png"><br><br>  <strong>Magnifier and cursor tracking</strong> <br><br>  Screensaver users can now turn on cursor tracking or focus.  This option allows you to automatically enlarge the screen in the active item area, which makes typing and keyboard navigation easier. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75f/d9b/d06/75fd9bd069a0b03db6ec7455c4b45c91.png"><br><br>  <strong>Other improvements</strong> <br><br>  Among other changes are the following: <br><ul><li>  Updated login screen with improved look and animation. </li><li>  Improved text alignment, making the interface elements more pleasant </li><li>  The date picker now lets you use the keyboard, and the sliders in the system menu support the Orca Narrator. </li><li>  Narrator got his own key combination (Super + Alt + S) </li><li>  Navigation elements appeared in the window menu of web applications. </li><li>  Dialogs for terminating the session and shutting down the computer now warn about other users working in the system and hung up applications </li><li>  Traditionally, new wallpaper :) </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195394/</a></p>
