      With our University of Mobile Advertising, we will help you understand all the intricacies and intricacies, and you will be able to better navigate the entire ecosystem of digital advertising. <br><br>  <i>Clever.</i>  <i>Easily digestible.</i>  <i>Ready to use.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/131/940/56c/13194056c37746daa14d9b10902bb934.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Advertising in its simplest forms</b> <br><br>  It all starts with the advertiser.  An advertiser wants to sell a product or service using an ad he creates.  In the past, it could be an advertisement in a newspaper or on the radio.  Currently, the volume of digital advertising is constantly growing, it is becoming more and more, and it is objectively trying to reach users on the Internet, to reach every consumer. <br><br>  So, the advertiser creates advertising. <br><br>  So, what is next? <br><br>  The advertiser can try himself as a distributor of his own advertising, taking all actions to make it catch the eye of as many people as possible. <br><br>  But it may take too much time and cost too much.  Not all advertisers are willing to take such a risk. <br>  Instead, the Advertiser contacts Publishers ‚Äî newspapers or websites who are committed to distributing (supplying) a large amount of content to consumers on a regular basis. <br><br>  This is the perfect partnership. <br><br>  The advertiser pays the Publisher a specified amount of money for showing his ad.  In turn, the Publisher publishes its content, along with the advertiser's advertisements, for its audience. <br><br>  Both sides benefit. <br><br>  The publisher makes a profit, and the Advertiser gets its advertising. <br>  The consumer becomes the goal of both the Advertiser and the Publisher, while receiving the best of two worlds: unique content from a well-known Publisher, along with Advertising things, services or objects that may be of interest to them and which they may want to buy. <br><br>  Such an advertising ecosystem is simple and clear as ‚Äúfive kopecks‚Äù. <br><br>  And then the Internet appears ... <br><br>  The Internet has changed things.  There was an additional complicating layer, which also needs to be taken into account. <br>  Yes, in the foundation, the advertising ecosystem is still the same, with Advertisers and Publishers agreeing to buy or sell advertising. <br>  With the development of the Internet, the Advertiser has gained access to millions of potential Publishers - websites that create a huge offer, advertising platforms (inventory).  Now it has become almost impossible for Advertisers to screen out and find the right place for the effective display of their advertising. <br><br>  <b>New Tools, Same Process</b> <br><br>  Thus, third-party digital Tools have been developed to help advertisers and Publishers effectively negotiate the purchase and placement of digital Advertising. <br><br>  Advertising networks, intermediary technology companies, have arisen to collect advertising platforms from the side of the Proposal - Publishers and organize them in such a way as to help the Advertisers make contact with the most diverse and accessible websites. <br><br>  DSP (demand-side platforms) and SSP (supply-side platforms) is a different set of digital tools that has emerged to help advertisers and publishers to better optimize the process of buying advertising. <br><br>  DSPs use online data to track and purchase Publisher‚Äôs inventory using automated software. <br><br>  So, I hope the question of the mechanics of mobile advertising has now become more accessible and transparent for you. <br><br>  We will be happy to answer any questions in the comments below. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297862/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297862/</a></p>
