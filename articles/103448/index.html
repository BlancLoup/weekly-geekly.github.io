  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Eychary of the largest IT-companies in Russia recruit staff</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  They say that IT people do not look for work, but choose.  Indeed, the demand for IT specialists exceeds supply, and it is extremely difficult to find a worthy candidate for the vacant position.  We interviewed eychars from leading IT companies and most complain that it‚Äôs a headache to find a good specialist.  Only the most resourceful can win the competition for the "head" of the next computer genius. <br><br>  For example, many Eychary use social networks such as linkedin.com and facebook.com, as well as technical forums and blogs.  We look out for young and promising at every kind of industry student competitions, organize a competition, the winners of which receive not only cash prizes, but also job offers in the company. <br>  Other euchars work painstakingly on a base for creating a network of contacts, include all the people who have ever contacted the company, and when a vacancy arises, first of all consider the resumes of these candidates.  The program ‚ÄúI recommend a friend‚Äù is also popular.  Employees eagerly recommend their relatives and friends, so gradually real family dynasties are formed in the company. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Personnel recruiters complain that it is sometimes impossible to sort out resumes without a technical dictionary, and IT specialists talk ineptly about their experiences.  At the interview they lack the skills of self-presentation, they answer all questions extremely shortly, and a non-formal interview can lead them to a dead end.

      <b>Alla Zabrovskaya</b> , <b>Google Russia‚Äôs PR Director</b> , told us about how to separate the wheat from the chaff, selecting the right specialists: proactive and caring.  We deliberately select people who are able to work as a team, since our engineering offices are scattered around the world, and an employee in the Moscow office can work on one project with his colleagues in Zurich, London or Mountain View in California. <br>  Candidate runs an average <u>of four to eight interviews</u> .  His resume always passes through a number of commissions, which carefully study the applicant's experience and the results of interviews, as well as academic performance and recommendations from both his former employees and our specialists.  All decisions at Google are made collectively, including hiring decisions. <br>  Yes, the whole process takes about a month, but it allows us to choose people who meet all our requirements in all respects, and the probability of error is minimized. ‚Äù <br><br>  At <b>Intel,</b> recruitment takes place as follows: ‚ÄúWhen selecting candidates at the initial stage, we draw attention to the knowledge and experience indicated in the summary, the more they are described, the more chances the applicant will be invited to an interview,‚Äù says <b>Vasily Komolov Intel recruitment in Russia</b> .  - At the same time, not only the formal work experience, which, for example, students may simply not have, plays a role, but also any developments and projects in which the applicant had to participate in the university, either within the framework of trainings or for themselves. <br>  If a candidate is invited for an interview, we expect to see confirmation of this knowledge.  Intel is committed to <u>‚Äúbehavioral‚Äù interviews</u> , during which we ask the candidate to tell real life examples when the candidate had to use different technologies or solve certain problems. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103448/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103448/</a></p>
