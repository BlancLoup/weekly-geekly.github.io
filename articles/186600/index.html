      It's no secret that many programmers have their own professional injuries and some other shortcomings. <br>  Among the shortcomings I can give the most common <br><br>  <b>Health problems</b> <br>  <i>A programmer spends most of his time at his desk (and not only).</i>  <i>What entails excess weight, muscle weakness, problems with posture.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It takes a lot of effort, time, and willpower to keep yourself in shape.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>Mental distortion</b> <br>  <i>Over the years as a programmer, my worldview has changed a lot, it has become more difficult for me to find a common language with people.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The reason is the acquisition of a different way of thinking when composing literate code and application structures.</i>  <i>Logic becomes the holy grail and panacea for any problems.</i>  <i>As far as I know, people of many other professions rarely resort to logic, as a result of which misunderstandings and ill fame of the "smart person" (sometimes an idiot) are created.</i>  <i>Over time, you will lose a lot of your old friends and acquaintances, and you or them will simply become uninteresting to you.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Problems with the opposite sex are also possible.</i>  <i>Girls are one of the most illogical creatures that I have seen, it will be quite difficult to find a common language and harmony.</i>  <i>Also, from my observations, I realized that guys (not programmers) are not very happy about girls of a similar profession and mindset.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But of course not everything is so bad.</i> <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Picture</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b52/99d/90b/b5299d90b061b657346eea923f4193af.png"></div></div><br>  <b>The mountains of the slain time</b> <br>  <i>The work of a programmer is always learning, whether you are a professional or a junior - you are always obliged to learn, read, master.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Get ready to give the lion's share of your free time to read books, textbooks, documentation, for experiments.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Alas, time does not return.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>Spoilage</b> <br>  <i>Nowadays, there are no widely used harmless information output devices, in other words, any monitor will inevitably take away your eyesight.</i>  <i>The problem lies not in radiation, but in the features of the structure of the human visual apparatus (you can read about it on the Internet).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We will have to spend additional time on eye exercises and the prevention of eye diseases.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>Partial grammar deterioration</b> <br>  <i>As a programmer, you have to read a lot, write a lot ... technical literature, which does not always take into account the importance of grammar or the grammatically complex text is practically absent.</i>  <i>Problems with the arrangement of commas and parentheses are also possible, since an automatic habit appears as during the compilation of a code.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In order not to slip into the pit, you need to spend additional time reading non-technical literature and writing articles and stories.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>Anxiety of others</b> <br>  <i>One day you may be disturbed by your neighbor's fourth aunt of your neighbor with a request to repair the computer, because you are a ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù, then the nephews of the owner of the dog who bit your cat last year will be addressed to you, and there will be no end to it.</i>  <i>There will be requests to advise a new phone, headphones, a new vacuum cleaner, to make a website, install Odn√©es or help with tables in the Word.</i>  <i>One day you‚Äôll get tired of it and you will refuse or ask for money, which is the right thing to do, but you will have a bad name among your stepbrother‚Äôs acquaintances.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Initially, it is better that no one knows that you are a programmer, unless of course you are pursuing commercial objectives.</i> <i><br></i> <br><h4>  Where to begin? </h4><br>  If you are not afraid of the consequences and you have firmly decided to be a programmer, then read on ... then there will be more. <br><br>  <b>Do I need to go somewhere?</b> <br>  <i>Enrolling in educational institutions is not necessary, but <u>highly desirable</u> .</i>  <i>Of course, if we are talking about normal vocational schools, if not, then it is better not to waste time.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Nowadays, self-study has become quite affordable, there are also a number of prestigious online universities.</i>  <i>But nothing compares to a professional teacher.</i>  <i>It is necessary to select a teacher or educational institution very carefully, your continued success depends on it.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>If you decide to do, the following article will be of little use to you.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>What's next?</b> <br>  <i>Next you need to choose what you want to do.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The main secret in productive learning and work is motivation!</i>  <i>And a very good motivation is the interest in the chosen discipline.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You will have to make a rather difficult decision and choose what you would like to do.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Do you dream of creating a unique website or do you have a great idea for a website?</i>  <i>Then your this is web programming, start with this.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Or maybe you want to create a game?</i>  <i>Then your game dev.</i>  <i>And so on.</i> <br><br>  <b>I chose the direction, I want to start</b> <br>  <i>No matter how trite it sounds, type in the search engine ‚ÄúHow to create a website?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúHow to create a game?‚Äù And carefully read the results of the issue.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Read?</i>  <i>Get used to it, you will often have to google and the results will not always satisfy you, but do not worry, everything will come with time.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Change requests, specify, add.</i>  <i>Look for supplies for beginners / dummies.</i>  <i>Profile books will do; you can easily find them (or a list of books) in a search, in a store or library.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Start with the basics, for example, if you want to learn how to make websites - learn how to typeset HTML and CSS, a good example of a textbook <a href="http://htmlbook.ru/">htmlbook.ru</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i>Try to make your first program / website "Hello World", then try to change something yourself.</i> <br><br>  <b>I can not do anything :(</b> <br>  <i>All is well!</i>  <i>The more mistakes you make now - the better you will understand the material and you will make less mistakes in the future.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Moscow was not built right away, labor made a monkey a man and a couple more sayings of your choice.</i>  <i>All programmers go through this.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Do not be afraid to ask for advice in forums / chats / blogs, no one will beat you for it, although you can listen to some criticism from imaginary "pros".</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The main thing is not to stop as it is difficult and it would not be clear, soon you will be involved :)</i> <br><br>  <b>I got something done</b> <br>  <i>Congratulations, the first brick is laid!</i>  <i>You can reward yourself with a bottle of beer / pie / juice.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can not stop there, you need to move forward and explore further.</i>  <i>If you stop, the programmer‚Äôs career will end.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Complicate your task, read about the incomprehensible, ask more questions about what interests you, try using libraries or frameworks, load yourself, try to create what you have long wanted, the <u>main thing is not to stop and do not despair!</u></i> <br><br>  <b>I began to understand what was happening</b> <br>  <i>This is the greatest misconception of novice programmers, almost every one of us went through this stage.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You fell under the effect of Dunning - Kruger</i> <i><br></i> <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Picture</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35d/ca0/9e6/35dca09e6df28a065d61814804fe4a5d.gif"></div></div><br>  It's time to get a job in a team of programmers to gain experience and to descend back to Earth. <br>  Do not immediately look for vacancies where the salary level is above the average for your city, at first you will receive quite a bit.  But now the main experience and gaining knowledge. <br>  Again, ask questions to colleagues, learn from experience, some Timlids eagerly teach juniors.  Take the initiative, but always give to the test team. <br><br>  You can buy a t-shirt with "yajprogrammist" and register on Habr√©. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  <i>You have become a novice programmer or a junior (Junior), you are not a programmer yet, but already something of yourself.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Do not be afraid of crutches and bicycles, the skill will come with experience.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Bicycles will help you to better understand technology, and crutches, over time, will help you to understand why it is impossible to do this.</i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c05/b5e/93d/c05b5e93d042a77825b3eae0c1467f5a.jpg"></i> <br><br>  On this topic suddenly ends, I wish you all success in your endeavors! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186600/</a></p>
