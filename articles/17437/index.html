      Google conducted a survey among Internet users in the 6 largest cities of Russia to analyze their behavior on the Internet in the process of making various purchases off the Web.  The survey results show that online advertising is also effective for offline businesses. <br><br>  According to the survey, 90% of users are actively using online resources to explore the product before buying it.  Of these, 77% go to the Internet to assess the quality of a product or service and compare prices for it, 65% study the products and offers in order to make a final decision;  63% are looking for an outlet to go shopping. <br><br>  The data obtained suggests that Russian users consider search services as the main resource for finding information about a product / service and seller (87%) and only 50% are sent directly to the manufacturers' websites. <br><br>  Vladimir Dolgov, director of Google Russia, comments on the results of the research: ‚ÄúIn fact, using search sites to research products or services is a growing factor in influencing the process of making purchasing decisions.  This explains why more and more companies, regardless of their size, use contextual advertising in search results in order to increase brand, product or service recognition and encourage the user to switch to a specific site.  Online advertising is accessible and measurable, and given the increasing number of people searching the Internet before buying something, it will be more than reasonable for a business of any level to follow users online. ‚Äù <br><br>  The effectiveness of online advertising is also underlined by a high response rate.  More than 50% of users take any action as a result of viewing contextual advertising on search sites - for example, they view information about the advertised product or seller. <br>  According to the survey, Google received the highest rating on user satisfaction with the information found, and respondents plan to use it in the future.  The study confirmed that the majority of users (57%), satisfied with the search results, access the same services on the next purchase. <br><br>  Konstantin Kuzmin, director of marketing for Google Russia: ‚ÄúPeople who actively use the search, go shopping, already making a certain decision.  They are competent in their preferences, know the characteristics of the product and have already compared several offers from manufacturers and sellers.  They know what, where and at what price they will purchase.  Such buyers will be more likely to influence the opinion of other people in the choice of a product or store. ‚Äù <br><br>  The survey shows that consumers who do not use online search, when choosing a purchase, rely most of all on the opinions of their friends (36%).  Traditional offline advertising is taken into account only 20% of buyers. <br><br>  Most often, Russian users are looking for information online, purchasing consumer electronics (83%), followed by IT products / services (43%), travel (31%) and financial services (27%) <br><br>  Understanding the behavior of the buyer, how he makes decisions and what source of information he considers most important is a key aspect of effectively promoting products and services on the market.  The main conclusion of this study is that an offline business of any size can increase the effectiveness of its marketing activities, using the Internet as a full-fledged communication tool for its products. <br>  Methodology: A quantitative study was conducted in October 2007 among over 1,500 users in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk and Samara.  The subject of research was the behavior of customers in the study of information online and the acquisition offline in four areas: travel, finance, retail, information technology. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17437/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17437/</a></p>
