  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Functional testing of Qt programs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Foreword </h4><br><p>  The only way to check that after your last correction made to the version control system, important application usage scenarios still work correctly (or at least work somehow) is, of course, take and run these scripts through the test system.  Doing it manually is long, tedious and fraught with mistakes. </p><br><p>  Considering all of the above, as well as the "insignificant" fact that the customer in TK prescribed the need for automatic testing of the functional requirements specified in the same TZ, at the start of the next project, the issue of choosing a tool to automate the GUI testing became relevant.  The project was on Qt, and required cross-platform (Windows, Linux). </p><br><p>  What finally opensource tool appeared, look on a cat. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8c/22f/581/e8c22f581d974b84ac14509f3a299fb7.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><h4>  GUI Testing Tools </h4><br><p>  What off-the-shelf GUI testing solutions were available at that time (a few years ago)? </p><br><p>  To summarize, there were two classes of possible utilities: </p><br><ol><li><p>  Programs created initially to automate user actions, and not to test. <br>  I think everyone can call a couple for their favorite OS.  For example, for Linux / X11 - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/214779/">see the post on Habr√©</a> . </p><br><p>  None of these utilities was suitable for us, since it did not satisfy at least one of the requirements formulated: </p><br><ol><li><p>  Cross platform <br>  Most of them are not cross-platform, i.e.  work either on Windows only or on Linux only. </p><br></li><li>  Excessive attachment to implementation details. <br>  Even if you solve the problem with cross-platform (for example, running the program on a Linux machine, and the X server for it on Windows), then over-binding to the implementation details leads to the following problems. </li></ol><br><p>  The simplest utilities recorded and reproduced mouse clicks in the coordinate system (CK) of the screen (i.e., another screen resolution - and the test drops), smarterly used the ICs of the window (another Qt style, another DPI - and the test drops).  The best knew how to recognize native OS widgets, but unfortunately, Qt very little used the native elements of a specific OS (Qt masks the appearance of its widgets for a specific OS, in this case Linux or Windows, but inside it is the same QWidget) . </p><br><p>  Bottom line: none of the utility of this class did not suit us.  It would be necessary to create two variants of tests for the same user experience scenario - for Linux and for Windows.  Plus, it would be too difficult to support the tests created with the help of them (any change in the interface breaks them). </p><br></li><li>  Programs created specifically for testing.  Considering experience (1), from this class of utilities we considered only utilities that have Qt support.  This was exactly one - squish ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/54614/">description on Habr√©</a> ) with the appropriate approach to pricing - "contact us, we will evaluate you and set the price."  So it was a few years ago, perhaps now something has changed.  I sent them a request, but did not wait for an answer. </li></ol><br><p>  The result is natural - it was decided to make such a tool on their own. </p><br><h4>  Qt Monkey </h4><br><h5>  Alpha version </h5><br><p> Initially, the task seemed pretty simple.  There is a Qt subsystem with the characteristic name <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtest.html">QTest</a> (I already used it in the project to write unit tests for my own widgets).  Using it is quite easy to record a sequence of keystrokes and mouse clicks ( <code>QTest::mouseClick</code> , <code>QTest::keyCick</code> ).  You can generate the test code using the <code>QEvent</code> -&gt; <code>QTest::something</code> transformation, first asking Qt with <code>qApp-&gt;installEventFilter</code> to report all events in the application under test.  As a result, the preliminary version was quickly ready. </p><br><p>  However, loading tests with the help of the plug-in mechanism and writing tests in C ++ for some reason did not cause understanding among QA engineers.  Fortunately, Qt has an easy way to embed JavaScript in an application ‚Äî <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtscript-index.html">QtScript</a> .  This subsystem makes it very easy, almost a couple of lines of code, to ensure the interaction of <code>QObject</code> and JavaScript heirs by translating calls in both directions: </p><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">QScriptEngine engine; QScriptValue global = engine.globalObject(); QScriptValue val = engine.newQObject(qobject); global.setProperty(QLatin1String(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"myobject"</span></span>), val);</code> </pre><br><p>  and in javascript: </p><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">myobject.slot1(); <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span></span> v = myobject.property1;</code> </pre><br><p>  It remains only to figure out how to identify widgets, because to create an object ( <code>QObject</code> ), the properties ( <code>Q_PROPERTY</code> ) of which - pointers to all graphic elements of the program that have ever been created, are quite difficult. </p><br><p>  After some period of reflection, we stopped at the following naming scheme for the widget: </p><br><p>  <em>"Parent identifier (if any)" point "identifier of a specific object"</em> , <br>  where the <em>"parent ID (if any)"</em> again breaks into a pair <br>  <em>"Parent ID of the parent (if any)" point "ID of a specific parent</em> . <em>"</em>  And so while <code>QObject::parent</code> returns non- <code>nullptr</code> . </p><br><p>  The identifier of a specific object can be either the name of the object ‚Äî the simplest case (if Qt Designer is used, the name of the object will be present), if the object is nameless, then we identify it through the class name and the sequence number. </p><br><p>  Example: </p><br><blockquote>  MainWindow.centralwidget.tabWidget.qt_tabwidget_stackedwidget.tab.pushButton_ModalDialog </blockquote><br><h5>  Beta version </h5><br><p>  It would seem that everything is great, tests are easily created, work on both platforms without any changes (because they are not tied to the pixel-by-pixel arrangement of the elements).  But it turned out that everything is not so simple.  The modal dialogs came into effect (then they were file open dialogs, but a banal <code>QMessageBox</code> with Yes / No would have caused the problem). </p><br><p>  The error was as follows: </p><br><ul><li>  <code>QTest::__</code> created the necessary instance of the <code>QEvent</code> descendant and using <code>QApplication::notify</code> delivered it to the necessary object; </li><li>  <code>QApplication::notify</code> works synchronously, i.e.  until the event is processed, he will not return control; </li><li>  in the case of a dialog, a new <code>QEventLoop</code> is created, and it starts processing events until the dialog is closed. </li></ul><br><p>  Thus, control from <code>QTest::-_</code> not return until the dialog is closed.  But how can the script close it, if the management does not return to it, until the dialogue is closed? </p><br><p>  The situation was aggravated by the fact that blocking the behavior of <code>QTest::-_</code> is just what we need, except, of course, the call of dialogues.  It is much easier to insert all sorts of checks into a test if you know what exactly after the line <br> <code>Test.activateItem('MainWindow.centralwidget.tabWidget.qt_tabwidget_tabbar', 'Tab 5');</code>  the tab <code>'Tab 5'</code> tab will be activated, rather than, say, five lines after it. </p><br><p>  Of course, if we have a blocking call, which we cannot avoid, the obvious solution is to create another thread, but, unfortunately, events related to the GUI should be processed only in the main thread.  Therefore, the first solution was the following (pseudocode): </p><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//addition thread qApp-&gt;postEvent(objectInGuiThread, customEventObject); semaphore-&gt;tryAcquire(timeout); //gui thread void ClassInGuiThread::customEvent() { QTest::somthing(); semaphore-&gt;release(); }</span></span></code> </pre><br><p>  Those.  using <code>QEvent</code> we notify an object that is in the main (GUI) thread that we need to do something, but because  <code>objectInGuiThread</code> is in a GUI thread, its <code>::customEvent</code> method will be called in the context of the thread's GUI, and the threads are synchronized using the semaphore. </p><br><p>  <em>Actually, the signal / slots mechanism works in a similar way when calling <code>QObject::connect</code> with the <code>Qt::QueuedConnection</code> , in the case when the signal is sent from one stream and the object that owns the slot is in another stream.</em> <em><br></em> </p><br><p>  The obvious disadvantage is that you need to correctly select the timeout in the <code>semaphore-&gt;tryAcquire(timeout);</code> call <code>semaphore-&gt;tryAcquire(timeout);</code>  .  If, for example, clicking on a widget causes a long operation, and we fall off on timeout, and then continue working, say, from trying to click on a widget that appears only after the completion of a long operation, the result may be unexpected for the author of the test. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D0aINaXBH7vI">The sadness</a> is also caused by the fact that <code>QCoreApplication::loopLevel()</code> made obsolete during the transition from Qt 3 to Qt 4, and it is only available when building Qt 4.x with the qt3support option, and returning its analog <code>QThread::loopLevel()</code> only in Qt 5.5.  Those.  It is difficult to distinguish the case of "pressing -&gt; long operation" from the case of "pressing -&gt; modal dialogue." </p><br><p>  The unobvious disadvantage of this code is how two consecutive events can be processed, the first of which closes the modal window, and the second, for example, simulates pressing on the keyboard.  In this case, because closing a <code>QEventLoop</code> created inside <code>QDialog::exec</code> not instantaneous (at least in a <code>QAbstractEventDispatcher</code> implementation using <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/">glib</a> ), the <code>QKeyEvent</code> can fall into a <code>QEventLoop</code> class, and then it will not call, for example , triggering the corresponding <code>QAction</code> in the main window. </p><br><p>  Therefore, the final version for dealing with modal dialogues was rather complicated: </p><br><ol><li><p>  Get the current <code>qApp-&gt;activeModalWidget()</code> modal widget, and you need to take into account that this method is not marked as thread-safe, so the code is called in another thread; </p><br></li><li><p>  Send a message asking to perform the desired click / click in the GUI thread; </p><br></li><li><p>  Verify with <code>qApp-&gt;sendPostedEvents</code> that the message of 2) reached <br>  and began to be processed; </p><br></li><li><p>  Repeat 1) and compare the results; </p><br></li><li>  If the new model widget does not appear, then we are waiting for completion 2) without a timeout, otherwise only a user-defined timeout (by default 5 seconds). </li></ol><br><p>  In this algorithm, there are also problems (if the new dialogue "appears" or "disappears" for more than 5 seconds), but in this case, using JavaScript, you can set a longer timeout, or even somehow synchronize.  Also, the user‚Äôs use <code>QEventLoop</code> without creating a modal dialog is not processed.  After defeating the dialogues, qt monkey earned quite stable, and the project was handed over. </p><br><h5>  Github version </h5><br><p>  Since  I still haven‚Äôt seen solutions with open source code for this kind of problem; then, being on forced leave, I decided to release the project for free floating.  Although the previous work did not object to the publication of qt monkey, I, just in case, rewriting from its scratch, laid out on github. </p><br><p>  The current version consists of three components: </p><br><ol><li><p>  A library to link with your project, then create a class <code>qt_monkey_agent::Agent</code> somewhere in the main thread; </p><br></li><li><p>  qtmonkey_app is a console program for communication with 1), using it, for example, you can run your tests in the continuous integration system; </p><br></li><li>  qtmonkey_gui is an elementary GUI for qtmonkey_app. </li></ol><br><p>  2 and 3 communicate using <code>stdout</code> / <code>stdin</code> , data streams are structured using <a href="http://www.json.org/json-ru.html">JSON</a> .  It is assumed that qtmonkey_gui can be easily replaced by a plugin for your favorite IDE. </p><br><p>  If there are people who are interested in this project, then it is easy to find by the words "qt monkey" on github.  Pull requests are welcome. </p></div>
