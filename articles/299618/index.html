And we all at least once came across them on the Internet.  Someone just was not lucky to accidentally run into, and someone was helped by competitors.  Someone has read and forgotten forever, but for some it may be hindered by problems in business. <br>  What to do with negative reviews about your work?  Such reviews, and sometimes even entire sites, can significantly spoil the blood.  But how to react to this negative is a question. <br>  Today we will analyze the case of work with negative on otzovikah.

      <b>In this regard, the company "N" decided to remove reviews and sent:</b> <br><ul><li>  Complaint to hosting provider <br>  The hosting provider replied that he would not block the site until a court decision was received. </li><li>  Complaint to search engines <br>  The complaint was not satisfied.  The search engine refused to remove sites from the search, as it did not see any violations. </li><li>  Claim to the site owner <br>  In response, the company "H" received an offer to remove reviews for immodest monetary compensation. </li></ul><br>  <b>What to do next?</b>  Pre-trial claims did not give the desired effect.  To go to court with the requirement to recognize such reviews information, damaging business reputation.  So the company "N" and entered, additional requirements were put forward to remove reviews from sites and collect reputational damages in the amount of 300,000 rubles. <br>  A lawsuit was brought against the site owner. <br><br>  However, the court also found no reason to satisfy the claims and indicated in the decision: <br><ul><li>  Information that does not correspond to reality is statements about facts or events that had no place in reality at the time to which the disputed information relates. </li><li>  They cannot be considered as false information contained in court decisions and sentences, decisions of the bodies of the preliminary investigation and other procedural or other official documents, for appealing and challenging which a different court order is provided for. </li><li>  The recall contains a documented not confirmed user opinion that the Company is deceiving customers and providing services that do not meet their expectations.  The arbitral tribunal believes that the above is a value judgment of the user. </li><li>  The functionality of the site allows you to leave a response to each review, which allows the Company to refute the opinions of users. </li><li>  The site owner or his authorized representative (due to the fact that they are objectively limited in their ability to determine the accuracy of information posted on the site by third parties, while imposing such a check on them would mean a departure from constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech) citizen information, if their unreliability is not disputable, in particular, is not established by a court decision.  Consequently, in such cases, before taking a court decision, they cannot be charged with the responsibility for refusing to remove the relevant information from the site, which does not preclude the use of other legal means, including measures to secure a claim, allowing, in particular, to suspend its distribution until final decision on litigation. </li></ul><br><h4>  <font color="#cc0000">Conclusion:</font> </h4>  The owner of the site, on which another person posted this or that information, is responsible for the lack of action to delete such information only if he fails to comply with a court decision. <br>  Similar judicial practice is quite extensive: Resolution of the CA of the MO of July 21, 2015 in case No. A40-69753 / 2014, Decision of the CA of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region of April 1, 2015, in case No. A56-3594 / 2015. <br><br>  <b>The situation could have been different if the site had not just reviews of dissatisfied customers, but affirmative information or accusations of a crime</b> . <br><br>  For example: <br>  <i><font color="#808080">"... the rogues of these LLC" H ", the prison is already on the horizon."</font></i> <i><font color="#808080"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#808080">‚ÄúHome work - kidalovo.</font></i>  <i><font color="#808080">Making candles at home from svegel from LLC "H".</font></i> <i><font color="#808080"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#808080">‚ÄúAgainst such contagion as OOO‚Äú N ‚Äù, there is one remedy - the courts.</font></i>  <i><font color="#808080">These scam artists know about this site, so do not believe the positive reviews, they simply do not. "</font></i> <i><font color="#808080"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#808080">"Company" H "is a scam of the all-Russian scale, you lose money."</font></i> <i><font color="#808080"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#808080">"Any company associated with the production of gel compositions - it's just kidalovo!".</font></i> <br><br>  Such information discredits and diminishes business reputation, as they are able to convince an indefinite circle of people familiar with them that the company produces and supplies low-quality products to the trading network and deceives counterparties, which means that it shows dishonesty in carrying out production and business activities, violates the current legislation.  (See, for example, Definition of the Supreme Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation of 07.08.2012 No. BAC-8444/12 in case No. A41-19354 / 11.) <br>  In this case, there is every chance to remove the information and recognize it defamatory business reputation. <br><br>  <b>Therefore, remember:</b> <b><br></b> <ul><li>  Not every review is defamatory information. </li><li>  If the recall contains a charge of crime or allegation, there is every chance of removal and compensation. </li><li>  An offer to remove a review for money can be considered as unfair competition. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc5/fc9/7b1/bc5fc97b1d234e96a6dc33236434a71e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b><font color="#906090">Bonus from <a href="http://reputationlab.ru/">Reputation Lab</a> (Prokhorov Nikita):</font></b> </h4><br>  When working with search results, you should carefully consider the presence in the issue of otzovikov sites.  We will separately consider the aspect of using otzovik sites as content islands.  However, in terms of work with search results, it is worth considering the fact of the benevolence of the presence of otzovikov in search results for branded queries.  On them, you are guaranteed to come across requests for the type of "brand reviews" and "brand employee reviews." <br><br>  <b>What you should pay attention in the first place?</b> <br>  Otzoviki sometimes pull brand evaluation into search results.  And it can be negative.  Or a negative snippet can be drawn up, which discourages users from making purchases even if they have a good (4 stars out of 5) ratings.  An example is shown below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a1/4cd/d04/9a14cdd044e944f786ce8fe5b1c1c90d.png"><br><br>  Secondly, there is a type of otzovik sites - otzoviki by employers.  This type of site is designed to provide feedback on current or former employees of the company. <br>  What is special about it?  As a rule, most of the reviews (real) on these sites are from former employees of the companies.  And most of the reviews boil down to the fact that some of the employees were fired and they leave angry reviews, which write everything they think about the brand in this situation.  As a result, sites with negative snippets are displayed in the search engine.  An example is shown below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/620/403/a2c/620403a2c2a04269a5dcd2b685623cb3.jpg"><br><br>  One of the sites-otzovikov on the example in the search results for the request "brand reviews" contains a snippet with extremely negative text about the brand.  In theory, a site with such a snippet should contain simply devastating content about this brand, and the rating should be extremely low.  However, I propose to open the site itself and explore what is there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d3/467/3ce/0d34673cecf743669960eea6b6211826.png"><br><br>  In the meantime, there‚Äôs nothing really scary on the site itself.  The total rating is 3 stars out of 5. That, in principle, is not so bad. <br>  In the snippet of the site pulled a fragment of one of the reviews.  It should pay attention to the "header" of the site.  And there is the heading "Reviews on the work.  Black list of employers.  Thus, the header fragment is pulled into the snippet of this site in search results.  If you examine the site code, you can find that in the code itself there are occurrences of the phrases ‚Äúblack list, book of complaints‚Äù and the like.  An example below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/670/bb3/a86/670bb3a863504568b48806d137140c6f.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f7/5b5/e69/7f75b5e6913345da9cb98fd511d203b6.jpg"><br><br>  It turns out that similar sites in some elements are optimized in such a way as to display negative descriptions in search snippets. <br><br>  Therefore, it is extremely important to pay attention to the otzoviki when working on the SERM.  In fact, there are two scenarios for working with them: <br><ol><li>  Change the tonality of the site.  You can seek to remove negative feedback, or you can encourage your clients to write feedback on your work. </li><li>  The displacement of the search engine from the issuance of the necessary requests. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>We hope that you will avoid such problems!</b>  <b>We wish only positive feedback from satisfied customers!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299618/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299618/</a></p>
