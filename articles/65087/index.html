  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MoneyBookers h. 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the request of the listeners, I write about working with this, in my opinion very promising in the CIS, payment system like <a href="http://moneybookers.com/">MoneyBookers</a> . <br><br>  <i>I will immediately make a small reservation - I am from the expanses of Ukraine, so my experience is mostly related to this country, but as far as I know, the system works identically for Russia.</i> <br><br>  And yet, I decided to ‚Äústart all over again‚Äù, i.e.  something like ‚ÄúMoneyBookers for Dummies‚Äù, so if you have been using the system for a long time, then it is unlikely that something will be new to you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What I want to note is that the system, although mostly oriented towards the UK and Europe, is not badly localized for us.  The site is translated into Russian (in some places it is clumsy, but everything is quite clear).  They also have a Russian support service that quite competently responds to your slander letters.  That's just the speed sometimes lame.  You can wait until one day, until they respond to your letter. <br>  Also during verification, if they call your phone, they also speak Russian.

      And it is just necessary to note that the system is very paronoidal with regard to the entered data, sometimes even too much.  So be careful when entering each character, as in many cases, changing some data is not possible without additional.  request to support.  And after the change will require re-verification. <br><br>  <b>and the account in the system is not a bank account.</b> <br><br><h4>  check in </h4><br>  Consists of 4 steps. <br><br>  In the first step, you will be asked to enter your email and password.  E-mail will be your unique identifier in the system and with it you will be able to accept payments. <br>  It is also necessary to remember that the system allows you to have only one account per person / legal entity.  If it so happens that you have more than one account, then one (and possibly both) can block and then you will have to torment one another with a support and explain why.  But if your accounts are not ‚Äúburned‚Äù (for the time being), then it is better to merge them into one through the procedure of merging accounts within the system. <br><br>  Further, when choosing an account type, you must specify who you are.  or or jur.  face.  Actually there is no difference in the system from what you choose.  All calculations will be conducted either from a physical person or from a legal entity. <br><br>  Place of residence - write <b>NOT the place where you actually live,</b> but <b>for which you get some bills or where you are registered</b> .  The fact that they write in the tips about the account replenishment is nonsense.  The fact is that during the validation of the account, they will send you a letter with the code at the entered address, but in addition to this, they may be asked to send passport scans with a residence permit, as well as some accounts in your name for the last 3 months.  Ideally, you live at the place of registration.  But if you changed the place of residence, then it would be better that all correspondence went to one address and there was someone who could send you this correspondence. <br><br>  You should also think in what currency to open an account.  Only one account with one currency can be made in the system.  Therefore, be attentive to this issue.  The system will be able to accept money in any currency by converting it into the currency of your account at its internal rate, but problems may arise when withdrawing money to a bank account or card.  Alfa Bank did not want to accept the euro into a dollar account, the money returned to the IB in a week, but the commission was gone.  Although with Privatbank this is not observed. <br><br>  This is followed by verification of email and personal data entry.  It seems there is nothing military except that everything needs <b>to</b> be <b>entered in Latin</b> , well, I will note once again that everything needs to be entered carefully and truthfully. <br>  Further confirmation, agreement with the rules and cheers!  Account created. <br><br><h4>  We are inside, what next? </h4><br><br>  By default you have a limit of 1000 selected units to withdraw money.  But do not rejoice too much, your account should immediately begin to check.  If this is not done, then after some time the system will block your account and you will not be able to withdraw or transfer money.  To validate the address, you will be sent a letter via regular mail with the code inside.  The code will need to enter in the system.  The letter is sent by royal mail, so it travels comfortably and quickly enough.  In 4 days I came to a province called Alushta (for comparison, the same amount, or even more, there is a letter in Ukraine). <br><br>  <b>Adding a card</b> <br>  Nothing military - fill in all the data (the card must be issued for the same last name as your account). <br>  The card must be open for online transactions.  Card verification happens this way - they withdraw a certain amount from its account (1.01 - 2.99), and you should look at the bank how much they have withdrawn and enter this amount in the system.  Then this money will be written to your account.  If your card currency is different from the currency in the system, the bank must support automatic conversion of money, otherwise the transaction will not work and MB may block the card. <br><br>  After validation of the card, your limit will be increased. <br>  You can add multiple cards.  All of them must be validated. <br><br>  <b>Add bank account</b> <br>  Choose a country, enter the SWIFT code (can be obtained on the website of your bank).  And the system itself determines your bank.  Next, enter the account number and that's it.  The bank account also needs to be verified in order to raise the limit and in order to withdraw money. <br><br><h4>  Deposit, withdraw and send money in the system </h4><br>  To deposit money to the account of the system, you must have a verified credit card, or make a transfer from a bank account. <br>  In the first case, the system will automatically write money from the card, and take a commission of 1.9% per transaction.  With a bank transfer, the commission is not charged by the system, but you will pay a commission to your bank as for the transfer of funds abroad in accordance with the tariff of your bank. <br><br>  To withdraw money, you must have a certain amount in your account, otherwise you will not even be shown a withdrawal page. <br>  When withdrawing money to a bank account, a fee of 2.55 USD will be charged.  (not a percentage!).  If you have several bank accounts in the system, a withdrawal of more than 350 euros to a <b>non-main</b> account will be subject to a commission of 3.5 euros. <br>  If you want to withdraw money to the card, then it should be only a visa.  Commission 2.55 USD and fixed. <br>  (it is necessary to get acquainted with the <a href="https://www.moneybookers.com/app/help.pl%3Fs%3Dfees">tariffs</a> , as for some countries they change) <br><br>  To send money to another account, it is enough to specify the amount in the selected currency, and also indicate whether it will be periodic payments (monthly) and whether it will be an escrow payment - i.e.  you send money, then receive the goods and only then the money is released for the recipient and he physically receives them into the account.  For this, a large commission is charged.  Next, specify the recipient's email, subject, explanations and money goes. <br>  It should be noted that if you send money to a person who is not registered in the system, they will still be accepted for sending, and an email will be sent to this email inviting you to register and receive money.  From this it follows that it is necessary to carefully enter e-mail so as not to be mistaken.  Although the system will shout that there is no such box, but it is better to check it 2 times. <br>  If there is no such box even in the network, then after several unsuccessful attempts to send mail, the money will be returned to you, but minus the commission. <br><br>  You can also send a mass payment to a whole bunch of addresses.  The principle of operation is the same.  The rates are the same. <br><br>  In general, their tariffs are quite loyal, for transfer between accounts take 1% but not more than 0.80 USD. <br>  Replenishment and withdrawal are also quite loyal.  When withdrawing a fixed amount, it is better to withdraw large amounts immediately, of course, depending on your limit. <br>  Money goes to your bank quickly.  Within two days they are already in the bank, but the rest is already dependent on the bank itself.  In Privat I received money in 3 days on a bank account.  For 2 per card. <br>  In Alpha Bank about + 2 more days.  Apparently the bank itself is doing something with them.  Well, given that all global dollar transactions go through America, then there may also be delays. <br><br>  These are the main points I wanted to write about the work of the system.  Probably this time I will round out.  Soon I will write another article on how to connect your site to receive payments (if of course it will be interesting) <br><br>  Thanks to all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65087/</a></p>
