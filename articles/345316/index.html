I was only the second programmer in this company (and the first one quit - that's why they took me).  No documentation, no knowledge transfer.  I had to invent everything myself. <br><br>  In my second job, I managed the same task in just four days.  There were as many as eight people on the team, so I could ask questions and get answers. <br><br>  Today there are people who say something like "we use Docker to configure the environment, so it takes less than an hour to include a new person in the project."

      On the one hand, I am, of course, happy for the new developers who do not need to go through the pain and suffering that I went through in due time.  But on the other hand, the ‚Äútuned working environment‚Äù is not at all equal to the ‚Äúdeveloper involved in the project.‚Äù  To work productively, a person needs something more than just a computer set up to develop this project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Manager's delusions </h2><br>  It may give the impression that by giving the new member of the team a customized computer, we did everything necessary for its further productive work.  Well, the truth is, what else does a programmer need, besides the computer, the chair, the table, and the source code of the project to be worked on? <br><br>  Such an approach can be very dangerous.  Dangerous for project managers and even more dangerous for a new developer.  In some companies where I worked, sometimes there was talk of this type: <br><br>  <i><b>Me</b> : How is the new developer?</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Manager</b> : Well, somehow it works ... Not so much yet, but I hope that it will get better over time.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Me</b> : What exactly is wrong?</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Manager</b> : Well, we helped him set up the working environment fairly quickly and gave him all the necessary access.</i>  <i>But it works slower than I expected.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Me</b> : Why did you expect it to work faster?</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Manager</b> : Firstly, he showed a good knowledge of Java in the interview.</i>  <i>Secondly, we put a lot of effort into automating the deployment of the working environment ‚Äî and this was supposed to help it get up to speed.</i>  <i>On his way there are no obstacles.</i> <br><br>  As you can see, the situation here is more dangerous for the programmer, since his work is rated as insufficiently effective.  The manager is not satisfied with how quickly the new developer works on the tasks.  And at the same time, the same manager believes that he did everything in his power to make his work effective (just by giving him a customized computer).  So, the whole thing in the ability or motivation of a new developer. <br><br>  In these conclusions, the most important reason for good (or bad) productivity is ignored: good relationships and a healthy team climate.  This is what should be focused on when adding a new employee, and it definitely cannot be automated.  And it will take more than a couple of hours. <br><br><h2>  Inclusion of a new employee in the team </h2><br>  This is one of the key responsibilities of managers and team leaders.  And this does not include the task of HR in hiring a new employee or the work of office services in organizing his workplace.  In my experience, this concept can include: <br><br><ul><li>  Meet the team in general </li><li>  Explaining the responsibility of each team member </li><li>  A clear explanation of the current goals of the team and future plans </li><li>  Clear explanation of team values </li><li>  Indication of people who can be contacted for help, as well as how often it is appropriate to do </li><li>  An explanation of the methodology used for the development and the invitation to the next meeting </li><li>  Explanation of the used communication channels in the team (chat rooms, mail, audio-video communication) with the provision of all necessary contacts </li><li>  Required feedback from the manager after the first completed task </li><li>  A clear understanding of what is familiar to the new employee from the used technology stack, and what needs to be studied.  Allocating time to study. </li><li>  Setting up the working environment (well, yes, this is also necessary) </li></ul><br><h2>  How long will it take? </h2><br>  It would be naive to believe that all of the above can be done in a couple of days.  In my experience, it takes at least two weeks to give a new employee everything he really needs for work.  After that, we can expect a smooth increase in its productivity, which will reach a maximum in a few quarters (I did not make a reservation, in 3-9 months).  And only after that you can look at the effectiveness of the programmer's work without indulgence. <br><br>  Of course, it all depends on the type and scale of the project.  Once I was in charge of developing a huge ERP system, where it took almost a year to switch on a new programmer.  This is a very important part of the work of the project manager.  It is not necessary to do everything yourself, but you need to control that it is still being done by someone. <br><br>  By showing friendliness and respect for your new employee, you lay the foundation for years of productive work.  Do not try to reduce the important process of dating and building a relationship with a person to setting up his computer and the paper work of the HR department.  So you do not get a colleague with whom it will be pleasant to work daily hand in hand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345316/</a></p>
