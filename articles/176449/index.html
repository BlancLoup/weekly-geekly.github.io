I talked about a lot of detail <a href="http://xn--80abeamcuufxbhgound0h9cl.xn--p1ai/blogs/post/5459/">here</a> , but, of course, not everything is there. <br><br>  Because of the long accumulated experience of butting with various departments, I have accumulated a lot of unconstructive to a number of them, but unconstructive to the cause of open data does not help.

      So not only we criticize, but we also praise in some way, but if we criticize, then with suggestions how and what to fix. <br><br>  First, the most important thing: <br><br>  <b>1. Open data has become an established trend.</b> <br><br>  Whatever happens next - they will be engaged, they will be revealed, the regions will pick them up at the flagpole, and the federal departments will butt for opportunities, powers, and who better understands this topic.  This is very important - when there is competition in a topic, it means it is alive. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>2. Talk about money</b> <br><br>  As expected, many departments have started talking about what data can be provided, only money is needed.  Somewhere these conversations are fully substantiated - as, for example, a representative of the prosecutor's office told about the fact that the crime registration system is actually completely rebuilt and it needs spending not even on data disclosure, but on their collection.  This is quite understandable. <br>  Another example is Rosstat, where colleagues also talk about money, taking a very conservative position on the assumption that their main consumer is unqualified.  In the case of Rosstat, many of the data they have accumulated for a long time and their arguments that funds are needed for their publication as open data, I find far-fetched. <br><br>  <b>3. Business pulled</b> <br><br>  So far, only a representative of the Support of Russia, but there will be others - Business Russia, the RF CCI and all the rest.  This is important, at least the economically significant information will be more open with their support.  However, it is important to remember that business needs do not cover all the needs of society.  There are data without commercial use, but valuable in themselves for the most varied public tasks.  For example, the data of the declarations of officials. <br><br>  <b>4. There will be a lot of data - but how to make it so that they are in demand</b> <br><br>  Getting 500 data sets by mid-July is easy.  Getting valuable datasets is more difficult.  How to get exactly the data that have value for developers is the question.  For this purpose, conducted surveys of developers and citizens. <br>  Surveys with different levels of coverage, but so far the developers are not so actively writing about what they want than they would like. <br><br>  The main thing that everyone lacks is the flow of request from the developers what data is needed.  Specific wishes which formats are needed.  Living examples of projects based on them. <br><br>  To this end, contests will be held this year - organized by us and many others, but they solve only part of the problem. <br><br>  Therefore, if you know any projects using open state data - write about them, it will be easier for us to convince the rest of the agencies in the discovery.  If there is data that is needed - you also need to know which ones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176449/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176449/</a></p>
