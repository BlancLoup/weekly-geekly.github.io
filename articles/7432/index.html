  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VTB24 loans and customer attitudes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I usually do not describe such an ‚Äúexperience‚Äù, since I don‚Äôt see much sense in this.  But this time I want to know the opinion of the public.  The opinion is whether everything should be like that (and I just find fault) or something is wrong in the Danish kingdom. <br><br>  And we are actually talking about lending at VTB24.  (many letters) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some time ago I took advantage of the offer from VTB24 and took out a loan.  The bank was chosen according to the principle ‚Äúnormal interest, quickly‚Äù.  Especially true was the second.  Since the possession of a salary card with an overdraft gives almost 100% guarantee of issuing a loan, this is what I did without indulging in superfluous thoughts. <br><br>  With the issuance of the loan, everything went smoothly (and quickly).  All explained, you can even say what you like.  "Interesting" was at that moment when I was going to make the first payment on the loan ...

      Being not a novice in the use of loans, I went to the bank's website and began to look for addresses of ATMs where you can deposit money into your account.  The first thing that surprised me was the ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù location of the excel file with ATM addresses (found almost by accident).  Well, God bless him (especially since I haven‚Äôt been expecting anything normal from the site with the copyright of art.lebedev studio), the sites of banks are almost always and not at all enough stars from the sky. <br><br>  The second thing that surprised me was the file size.  Well, in the end I was finished off, that in the file with a size of 30 KB there were ATMs not only in Moscow, but also in other cities!  Anticipating the number of "places to collect funds from the population", I filtered all the cities except the capital and was completely upset ... 44 ATMs for the whole city.  To some it may seem like a lot, but for me it‚Äôs ridiculously small.  (Looking ahead at once I will say that in search of VTB ATMs I have met dozens of ATMs of other banks. The same RS, City, Bank-Moscow, etc.) <br><br>  However, I don‚Äôt have to choose, I write down the addresses of the 6 closest (and not so) ATMs and get ready to go.  (Here I made the first mistake without taking the whole excel file with me on the road.) I was somewhat embarrassed by the strange names of the locations (for example, ‚ÄúSO-CDU UES‚Äù), but I did not attach any importance to this. <br><br>  Arriving at the first address, I was pleased to find an ATM at the right place and bravely went to it.  I inserted a card, entered a PIN, poked into a "deposit of funds".  Having received a message about the impossibility of performing an operation, I, accustomed to such behavior, hemmed and repeated the operation ... having received the second identical erroneous message, I started to get nervous. <br><br>  Unfortunately, it was only here that I had the sense to pay attention to the fact that at VTB money was received at ATMs not by the ATM itself, but by an incomprehensible extension to it.  And this damn extension didn't show signs of life. <br><br>  ok, let's go to the next one.  Arriving at the following address, I was slightly surprised.  But nothing like the building where the ATM could stand did not see.  It turned out to be in some institution ala "state structure".  Has entered.  Fig two.  Only the call button, from which the ‚Äúextremely friendly voice‚Äù told me where I could go with my desire to get to the ATM.  After some altercations (actually obscenities), we managed to find out that the ATM did not work. <br><br>  Here it is necessary to make a remark that in the file with ATMs indicated ‚ÄúFree access.  Around the clock. "Yeah.  Ten times‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Having counted to ten, I went to the next ATM.  He came and once again marveled at the simply <b>amazing</b> logic of choosing ATM installation locations by VTB Bank.  It was a building.  Huge.  With a bunch of any ministries, or if there are any other departments.  Having circled around, I learned from the most friendly waiter, where I had to go in to find what I was looking for.  (in fact, hell guess) And I found ... here I was already openly swearing, not ashamed of a beautiful, spacious and completely empty hall with a stunning echo. <br><br>  The fact is that this ATM was completely unaware of the function of receiving money.  That is, in general, and nothing!  I got angry, I confess.  He climbed the VTB website and checked that an ATM with this function was located at this address.  Yeah.  Worth it.  I called the bank and they assured me that he knew how to receive money.  Everyone knew about it, except for a damn ATM !!! <br><br>  Having counted up to one hundred, I realized that I had made a grave mistake and did not call all the contact numbers listed next to the addresses of ATMs.  Unfortunately, on a piece of paper in my pocket was not (did not think). <br><br>  I traveled three more ATMs ... one of them was missing (instead of an ATM, there was a wall socket).  Two did not work.  This gut, comrades.  (you can't throw the words out of the song) And this is so if only because the bank doesn‚Äôt know about the real situation with ATMs.  Generally and in any way.  Moreover, pointing out in the booklet (which I later found at home) next to the CSH ATM (that is, the function of receiving money) frankly misinforms customers and blatantly lie on the phone (I suspect that not from big love to spoil, but simply not having any information). <br><br>  And this is "one of the largest banks in Russia."  Comrades, what the fuck is the largest bank can afford such a situation ?!  This is just a mockery of customers.  The same Russian Standard, City Bank, MDM, Bank Moscow and so on, and so on, place dozens of their ATMs!  They put them in stores, in <b>people</b> places, and not ‚Äúfuck-knows-where-guard-not-let-go-nayuh.‚Äù  What a joke?  What is the trick?  I do not understand.  So it should be something ???  Frankly speaking, I did not expect such a curtsey from the ‚Äúlargest bank‚Äù to myself (the client) at all. <br><br>  PS Yes, I paid the bill.  Climbing up at one of the metro stations to smoke nervously and go for something to drink, I saw an advertisement from TO (additional office), where I satisfied all my vile needs at the ticket office.  It‚Äôs a pity I didn‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs better to do it right away, and not to pretend that I‚Äôm a client of a normal bank with a developed infrastructure. <br>  PPS Later, I will describe my impressions of working with VTB's ‚ÄúTV bank‚Äù. <br>  PPPS Sorry for the mistakes - read frankly laziness. <br>  PPPPS Please do not join the discussion about the art.lebedev label.  I do not like this studio.  I have the right. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7432/</a></p>
