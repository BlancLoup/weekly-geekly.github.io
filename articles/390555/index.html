  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Faster seconds: robots continue to improve the build time of the Rubik's cube</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The first attempt to assemble a Rubik's cube intuitively, without using the already developed and well-described methods, stumbles upon a powerless defeat.  After reading the corresponding instructions, the problem is solved, although the repetition of algorithms takes a minute.  But what is the minimum time it takes to bring each of the faces of a randomly mixed cube to one color?  People have reached five seconds.  And cars have recently become faster than a second.  We are talking about the already <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269688/">described robot Jay Flatland</a> and even faster new contender for the world record Sub1. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/E6TJLVgl0yo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhijy-eTTokXaD4gLlZnybppvrbPDg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  So, the task is to get a randomly mixed 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 cube, get acquainted with its configuration and rotation to bring each of the faces to the same color.  It is not necessary to do this blindly or in the dark, the movements are not limited in any way.  Only speed is needed.  Permissible models of cubes, the order of mixing and other details are regulated by the organization registering the result.  One thing remains the same: the maximum optimal number of moves can never be greater than 20. This is the so-called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC_%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0">number of God</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now the record among the people <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php">belongs to the</a> American teenager Lukas Atter.  He put it in the fall of 2015, solving a puzzle in 4.9 seconds.  The record is registered by the World Cube Association, the organization that regulates Rubik's Cube competitions.  The result is a <a href="http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/rubik.html">gradual improvement over the past decades</a> .  For example, in 1982 the time was 19 seconds.

Why solve the problem with machines rather than clumsy fingers?  Like humans, robots smoothly improve results, albeit much faster.  For example, in 2011, CubeStormer 2 was <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/130554/">able to handle it in a little over 5 seconds</a> .  In 2014, CubeStormer 3 <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/216121/">brought each face of the cube to one color in 3,253 seconds</a> .  For some time in the Guinness Book of Records a robot was recorded in 2.39 seconds.  But a few days ago, it was replaced by a time of 0.900 seconds. <br><br>  The champion was the robot of two software developers Jay Flatland and Paul Rose from the city of Oleyta in the state of Kansas.  In January, the authors <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269688/">uploaded</a> a video on YouTube with a device that was able to solve the puzzle in 1.1 seconds.  A robot is a collection of relatively public electronic components and software.  This is the implementation of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">two-phase algorithm of Kotsmby</a> , 4 webcams and 6 stepper motors. <br><br>  After removing the barriers, four USB cameras register the cube configuration.  The data comes to a regular personal computer running an operating system of the Linux family.  The application program calculates the state of the cube, gets a solution from the implementation of the Cocemba algorithm and controls the process of movement.  Rose rewrote the Java C ++ sample and made the program faster.  Stepper motors are based on a frame created using a 3D printer.  Drivers for DRV8255 engines are controlled by an Arduino chip.  At their ends are small printed legs, which are used to make contact with the puzzle.  The cube itself is slightly modified: in the central segment of each of the faces, 4 tiny holes are drilled, in which these legs enter at the ends of the engines' axes.  It can be argued that changes have been made to the design of the puzzle.  But the result is recorded by the ‚ÄúGuinness Book of Records‚Äù according to its own criteria, which also include WCA requirements.  Past record-breaking robots also used slightly modified cubes, which did not violate the <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/">subsection 3h</a> , defining permissible modifications. <br><br>  On February 5, Flatland and Rose's robot collected a cube mixed by the TNoodle program in 0.900 seconds and 18 moves in the presence of representatives of the Guinness Book of Records.  Changes in the solution algorithms are noticeable - in earlier demonstrations the result was around 1.1 seconds.  As Flatland <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DgVF_XUccMuo%26lc%3Dz131wpfqpm3dhzpes22cvnsjsyrctl1vx.1454771926365793">writes</a> , he managed to achieve a result of a little more than 0.8 and even 0.7 seconds, but of the three attempts deferred by the judge, the best was 0.9. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IAcq826kUZQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh3Zz8-xqAHEp-03WEMufMKq3asIQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <em>Accelerated shooting record shows the speed of movement.</em>  <em>The original video at normal speed is up to kata.</em> <br><br>  However, this record may soon be broken.  In some ways he has already been beaten: the creator of Sub1, Albert Beer, claims that he was the first in the world who managed to stop in under a second.  January 23, 2016 in Munich in the store Cubikon was shown a result of 0.887 seconds.  This time came from the third attempt.  The first gave 1.043 seconds, the second ended with the wrong decision because of the glare on the cube.  Typical time is in the region of 0.9-1.0 seconds.  The record result was not officially registered. <br><br>  Little is known about the design.  As you can see, the high-speed 57-mm ZhanChi cube of the WCA standard is held by a steel structure, not a plastic one from a 3D printer.  Bir specially learned how to cook for his project.  As motor controllers, Toshiba TB6560 boards are used. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gVF_XUccMuo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh3-zTyCR5wtyDBnWrvhednt2RWzw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <em>New contender for the record - Sub1.</em> <br><br>  Flatland praised <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DgVF_XUccMuo%26lc%3Dz131wpfqpm3dhzpes22cvnsjsyrctl1vx.1454777115214739">the</a> work of Beer.  The author of the current record liked the design of the structure, neat cabling and lighting.  Flatland even stated that Sub1 could be better than his sample, and using such a robot you can achieve results in the half-second area. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hVVtrlgoe8Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi-MC0fC066oOtkh49BUZpU3mKLMg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <em>0.887 seconds resolving at normal speed and five times slower.</em> <br><br>  New Sub1 record still needs to be registered.  Competition cannot be described as a battle.  Current champions have already played enough with their project and would like to change it to something else, for example, creating videos for YouTube.  Flatland even friendly offered his advice and help to Biru. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390555/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390555/</a></p>
