At the head of the table is the base commander, General Fred, a heavy-set man with sharp features. <br><br>  <b>General Fred</b> : Messages confirmed.  New York is full of ... zombies. <br>  <b>Colonel Todd</b> : Again ?!  But we already had zombies, 28 days ago! <br>  <b>General Fred</b> : These zombies ... they are different.  These are <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8">philosophical zombies</a> . <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Captain Madd</b> : Are they aggressive?

But they are unconscious. <br><br>  Oppressive silence.

      <b>Colonel Todd</b> : Oh my God. <br><br>  General Fred got up and walked over to the big screen on the wall. <br><br>  <b>General Fred</b> : This is New York two weeks ago. <br><br>  Frames are replaced on the screen: a noisy crowded street, a restaurant with diners, employees loading the dumpster into a truck. <br><br>  <b>General Fred</b> : And this is New York ... today. <br><br>  On the screen - the metro station at rush hour, a noisy group of students in the park, a couple walking along the embankment. <br><br>  <b>Colonel Todd</b> : This is much worse than I could have imagined. <br>  <b>Captain Madd</b> : Why? <br>  <b>Colonel Todd</b> : Never in my life have I seen such sinister routine. <br><br>  A scientist came to the table in a lab coat. <br><br>  <b>Scientist</b> : The disease deprives a person of consciousness, without in any way affecting the brain.  We are trying to determine the distribution path.  The disease affects the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">dual properties of</a> matter, so we came to the conclusion that it acts outside our Universe.  We are dealing with an <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD">epiphenomenal</a> virus. <br>  <b>General Fred</b> : Are you sure? <br>  <b>Scientist</b> : As much as we can be sure in the absence of any evidence. <br>  <b>General Fred</b> : So.  Make a report on each epiphenomenon that occurred.  Where, how and with whom.  I need a complete list of everything unobservable in the last 50 years. <br>  <b>Captain Madd</b> : If the virus is epiphenomenal, how do we know that it exists? <br>  <b>Scientist</b> : Just as we learned that we are conscious. <br>  <b>Captain Madd</b> : Um ... ok. <br>  <b>General Fred</b> : What are the successes with epiphenomenal medicine? <br>  <b>Scientist</b> : We tried every known placebo.  It's all a mess.  They all have effects. <br>  <b>General Fred</b> : Tried to connect homeopaths to work? <br>  <b>Scientist</b> : We tried, sir!  We could not find them! <br>  <b>General Fred</b> : Great.  And the Taoists? <br>  <b>Scientist</b> : They refuse to do anything! <br>  <b>General Fred</b> : So we still have a chance. <br>  <b>Colonel Todd</b> : And what about <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581,_%25D0%2594%25D1%258D%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4">David Chalmers</a> ?  Shouldn't he be here? <br>  <b>General Fred</b> : Chalmers ... he was one of the first to become infected. <br>  <b>Colonel Todd</b> : Damn ... <br><br><hr><br>  Medical insulator with bullet-proof glass walls.  David Chalmers wanders aimlessly from corner to corner.  A doctor approaches the isolator. <br><br>  <b>Doctor</b> : David!  David Chalmers!  Do you hear me? <br>  <b>Chalmers</b> : I hear. <br>  <b>Nurse</b> : It's no good ... <br>  <b>Chalmers</b> : I'm fine.  I watched my thoughts and feelings, and did not notice any changes.  I know that is what you expect to hear from me, but ... <br><br>  The doctor turned away from the glass. <br><br>  <b>Doctor</b> : His words mean nothing more. <br>  <b>Chalmers</b> : This is some kind of crazy perversion of my philosophical ideas.  What you are saying is just nonsense! <br>  <b>Doctor</b> : Why is this? <br>  <b>Chalmers</b> : Because ... <br><br><hr><br>  Two soldiers in camouflage, an officer and a sergeant, are guarding a country road leading to a large metal gate of a huge concrete structure.  On their form is a patch with the inscription "QUARANTINE". <br><br>  <b>Officer</b> : Fuck you recognize these bastards.  They look like people, talk like people, until the last molecule is no different from people.  But they are not people. <br>  <b>Sergeant</b> : Freaks ... <br><br>  In the distance came the roar of the engine.  A man appeared on a white motorcycle.  He was in black glasses, in a strict black leather suit with a black leather tie, and in silver shoes.  Gray beard fluttering in the wind.  The man in the suit stopped abruptly at the gate.  Two soldiers ran up to him. <br><br>  <b>Officer</b> : Stand!  Who are you to? <br>  <b>Man in Suit</b> : Is David Chalmers in here? <br>  <b>Sergeant</b> : What do you mean, is he your friend? <br>  <b>Man in Suit</b> : Not really.  But even the zombies have rights. <br>  <b>Officer</b> : Show your <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0">quali</a> . <br>  <b>Man in a suit</b> : I don‚Äôt have them. <br><br>  The sergeant drew his gun. <br><br>  <b>Sergeant</b> : Hop up, zombies! <br>  <b>Officer</b> : Stop.  Zombies always say they have qualia. <br>  <b>Sergeant</b> : So he is a normal person? <br>  <b>Officer</b> : No, they say the same thing. <br><br>  The guards froze in confusion. <br><br>  <b>Sergeant</b> : Um ... <br>  <b>Officer</b> : Who are you? <br>  <b>Man in Suit</b> : I'm <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582,_%25D0%2594%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB">Daniel Dennett</a> , creature! <br><br>  As if from nowhere, Dennett drew his sword and with a ringing clang he cut the sergeant's pistol.  The officer reached for his own, but Dennett suddenly found himself behind him and cut his collarbone and spine with a sword.  The officer dropped dead.  The sergeant backed away in panic. <br><br>  <b>Sergeant</b> : This is impossible!  What was it?! <br>  <b>Dennett</b> : I am one with my body. <br><br>  The next blow Dennet sent a sergeant to his commander.  After that, he turned to the huge structure and tightened his sword in his hand. <br><br>  <b>Dennett</b> (quietly, to himself): A spoon exists. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>General Fred</b> : Just received a report.  We lost Detroit. <br>  <b>Captain Madd</b> : Not that I‚Äôm happy about it, but ... <br>  <b>General Fred</b> : The population of Australia has become a simple matter. <br>  <b>Colonel Todd</b> : The epiphenomenal virus is spreading faster and faster.  We can lose the human civilization as we know it.  The fate of all mankind depends on us. <br>  <b>Captain Madd</b> : We can try to negotiate with them ... <br>  <b>General Fred</b> : We tried to contact them several times, and received only one answer. <br>  <b>Captain Madd</b> : What? <br>  <b>General Fred</b> : We'll find out soon. <br><br>  The secretary entered with an envelope in his hands and handed it to the general.  He opened the envelope, took out a piece of paper and stared at it in silence. <br><br>  <b>Captain Madd</b> : What are they writing? <br>  <b>General Fred</b> : They wrote ... "It <i>'s your</i> virus." <br><br>  Deathly silence.  Colonel Todd slowly raised his hands to his eyes. <br><br>  <b>Colonel Todd</b> : Oh god, that's true.  It's true.  I ... - A tear rolled down his cheek.  - I do not feel anything. <br><br><hr>  <i>About the author: <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%2595%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Eliezer Yudkowski</a> - co-founder and researcher at the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute">Research Institute of Machine Intelligence</a> (formerly the Institute of Singularities), also works on <a href="http://lesswrong.ru/">the Less Wrong blog</a> and on the <a href="http://hpmor.ru/">book Harry Potter and Rational Thinking Methods</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362249/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362249/</a></p>
