Well, the name ... It just happened ... <br><br>  Userfriedly.Gov is a project in which we investigated the electronic representation of government agencies in different countries in order to answer the following questions: <br>  - which e-services of the state (including non-existent at the moment) are popular among the population of different countries; <br>  - Which of the countries of the world most effectively and efficiently (from the point of view of the population, and not the use of funds) are developing the e-state system; <br>  - what are the development prospects for the next five years are available for e-government systems in those countries that are now ahead of the rest; <br>  - how will the economic crisis affect the development of e-government systems (Oh, there are so many interesting things - it will be separate); <br><br>  And, perhaps, the most important question: how should a comfortable, from the point of view of the people, system of the electronic state look and work?

      Immediately I will apologize for possible errors - the text was written late at night, I checked, but could not notice the errors in the text ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I think there is no need to retell serious work that has been going on for half a year.  Therefore, I decided to answer today only the last, most important question. <br><br>  <b>What is the ideal e-state?</b> <br><br>  <b>1. Single gateway.</b> <br><br>  About two years ago this phenomenon almost did not exist in the e-state system.  Now there has been a pleasant progress.  The meaning is simple - the ability to access all state.  resources through a single portal.  The portal address must be <pre>  www.coutryname.countrydomain </pre>  - in this case, there is a high probability that a person who only realizes the existence of such a site will fall on it from the first time. <br><br>  However, there are pitfalls here.  It is important that the central portal is not overloaded with information (as in <a href="http://www.gov.sg/">Singapore</a> ).  And of course, it‚Äôs not necessary to turn it into a tourist portal (like in <a href="http://www.poland.gov.pl/">Poland</a> or <a href="http://www.denmark.dk/en">Denmark</a> ).  A link to the tourist portal should certainly be available, but the main site should publish information targeted at all users, not just tourists.  On the central state site should be placed useful for the user services that the state can provide him. <br><br>  Example: <a href="http://www.usa.gov/">USA</a> , <a href="http://www.eesti.ee/">Estonia</a> , <a href="http://india.gov.in/">India</a> , <a href="http://www.latvija.lv/RU/WebLinks">Latvia</a> . <br><br>  <b>2. Connectedness.</b> <br><br>  All e-government sites must be linked.  And not only text (This site is part of the electronic space system of the Republic of Hexandia), but also graphically.  Like, for example, blogs on the <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> system (pay attention to the user panel at the top of the page) or Google system services (trite - a single system logo and authorization panel + a bar at the top ‚ÄúYou are in the system ...‚Äù)  Amazingly - but very few states took care to create the effect of connectedness of their sites. <br><br>  Example: <a href="http://www.gov.sg/">Singapore</a> , <a href="http://canada.gc.ca/home.html">Canada</a> , <a href="http://india.gov.in/">India</a> , <a href="http://www.europa.eu/">EU</a> , etc. <br><br>  <b>3. More schematics.</b> <br><br>  If the state wants to offer the user information about the state bodies and their functions, there is no need to give him a pile of references and the Constitution to the bargain.  It is much more convenient for the user to draw a scheme (global scheme) of the work of state bodies.  It is very hard - but worth it.  And it is very interesting.  If the state really wants to convey to the person information about the budget, or, let's say about any project, it should be done as schematically as possible - no one will read the sheets with paragraph symbols.  Unfortunately, I did not find examples among existing countries. <br><br>  Examples: <a href="http://ak.zoomorama.com/static/app/browser/zoombrowser@zoomorama.com/release/latest/browser.swf?indexURL=http://ak.zoomorama.com/data/1.0/zml/01-a2764f29e9cdd084ede4a0591fa59346/01-5d1139b8bd1d85a2e590b31e015d1bb4/index.zml?indexURL=">US Budget 2010</a> . <br><br>  <b>4. Friendliness to the public.</b> <br><br>  It is clear that not all countries are well underway with the introduction of ID-cards or voting by mobile phone.  But still, if there is an opportunity to create a resource of communication with the population - the state should do it.  In the end, who was created for whom?  For example, the possibility of creating a ‚ÄúDirect Democracy‚Äù web project, where people could make proposals to local authorities to solve the most important problems, was recently discussed. <br><br>  Examples: <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/">White House Information Exchange Initiative with the public</a> , <a href="https://www.osale.ee/">System together with the public for improving laws in Estonia</a> , etc. <br><br>  Of course, about the friendliness of the population and says the design of the site of state.  structures, and the presence of a variety of Web 2.0 - stuff (integration with social networks, etc.).  Of course, it would be nice to have the opportunity to pay for a visa in the US using PayPal or Google Checkout or Webmoney or a simple bank transfer (the key word here is - or - that is, having a choice) ... <br><br>  And of course, about any jokes like "And we do not support IE 5" speech can not be.  The system should have alternative versions for different versions of browsers, Flash, and more.  Of course, there should be special versions for users with limited capabilities (amazingly, I did not find a single site of a large state that would provide support for users with disabilities - increasing the font by one and a half pixels does not count). <br><br>  <b>The ending.</b> <br><br>  There is still much to do to develop the systems of the electronic state  I think that after the states can improve their systems from the inside, they will begin their global integration so that a resident of Scotland, for example, can use the services of the US Immigration Service website using their identity document.  The EU has already taken small steps towards such integration. <br><br>  Now, when we finish the project, some of its participants have an interesting idea.  The idea is to create a state site of the Soviet Union (or invent any other virtual state, say, Liliputia).  Imagine what services could be available to the public, think up how the websites of public institutions would look like and how they would be connected.  Create all of this and put down the date, say, May 1, 1989.  And freeze it all for future generations.  The idea, of course, is interesting, but the scale of work is frightening ... So if there are those among those who would like to create the perfect electronic representation of the state, we will be glad to cooperate with you on a voluntary basis. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65348/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65348/</a></p>
