    <h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. You are more distracted</font> </h2><br><blockquote>  Overcoming circumstances and distractions, everyone necessarily achieves a goal or destination. </blockquote><br>  - Christopher Columbus <br><br>  Have you ever noticed that if you are not productive, it is easier to get distracted?  And if you do not take care, the absent-mindedness will continue to grow until it turns into a bad tradition. <br><br>  And when you accustom yourself to absentmindedness, it will become a bad habit. <br><br>  A bad habit that will destroy your ability to concentrate.  And it will become more difficult to keep focus for long periods. <br><br>  <i><b>Spend <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/vsemu-svoe-rabochee-vremya/">more time on effective activities</a> , then you will not be able to be scattered most of the day.</b></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. You turn into the viewer</font> </h2><br><blockquote>  Life is not a spectacular sport.  If you are going to spend most of your life on the podium, watching what is happening, in my opinion, you are wasting your time in vain ... </blockquote><br>  - Jackie Robinson <br><br>  Who would you rather be?  Those who improve their skills and work productively, or those who watch TV for 7 hours a day? <br><br>  The difference between them is that one acts and the other watches it. <br><br>  And, turning into a spectator of life, you begin to criticize others more actively, and <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-otklyuchit-vnutrennego-kritika-i-ignorirovat-stremlenie-k-sovershenstvu/">criticism is an unproductive thing</a> . <br>  Go to YouTube and find, for example, a video of Justin Bieber or Miley Cyrus. <br><br>  We can bet you will find thousands of viewers there.  And guess what they are doing?  Criticize in comments Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus! <br><br>  Here is another example.  Before you are the players playing on the field, and the audience watching their actions. <br>  And which of them turns into criticism, when one of the teams loses or hits the gate?  Spectators! <br><br>  The same principle applies to your life. <br><br>  <i><b>Having lost effectiveness, you eventually begin to observe and pay attention to what you simply did not notice before!</b></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. You start to lose focus.</font> </h2><br><blockquote>  Concentrate all your thoughts on the work being done.  The sun's rays do not give fire until they are focused. </blockquote><br>  - Alexander Graham Bell <br><br>  Being engaged in something insignificant, you begin to lose focus.  You can confirm this experimentally if you want. <br><br>  Example: you are traveling by train reading an e-book.  But the moment you drop it, attention switches to the chatter of fellow travelers. <br><br>  And if you do so often enough, then as a result you will refuse to read at all. <br><br>  <i><b>The same principle applies to everything on which to concentrate.</b></i>  <i><b>Therefore, keep your focus longer and less likely to be distracted.</b></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. You will spend time on things that don't matter.</font> </h2><br>  Have you ever seen teenagers, students or young people hanging around at intersections almost without work?  This is an excellent example for the problem we are talking about. <br><br>  Without being productive, you spend time on meaningless things.  Most part of time.  For example, you hang around at intersections or wander around the city without doing anything important. <br><br>  Browse international news, read yellow magazines, scroll through photos of people on Facebook and follow their status updates, etc. <br><br>  <i><b>This is a very dangerous habit.</b></i>  <i><b>Respect your time and use it wisely.</b></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. You become lazy</font> </h2><br><blockquote>  Laziness is nothing but the habit of resting before tiredness appears ... </blockquote><br>  - Jules Renard <br><br>  Lazy people for the most part are very different from productive people. <br><br>  And the type of laziness that we are talking about suffers from people who refuse to do at least something.  Or creating excuses that explain why they do not need or should not do something. <br><br>  If you do not benefit, there is a chance to turn into a lazy.  And after the emergence of such a habit to find that they regularly look for excuses for themselves. <br><br>  And if you are addicted to finding excuses, you will not do ANYTHING.  And without doing anything, you will become more useless than productive. <br><br>  The goal is not just to stay active, it is to be productive.  Physical culture is a good way to get rid of laziness and similar feelings. <br><br>  <i><b>If your energy level is always high, then you are more likely to be concentrated and effective.</b></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. You will have nothing to do</font> </h2><br>  This is associated with item number 4.  When you have nothing to do, you lose a guide for movement. <br><br>  When no important things are left, you are doing something.  And this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù usually turns out to be entertainment, leading to the appearance of bad habits. <br><br>  But the truth is that <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/7-sposobov-ispolzovaniya-svobodnogo-vremeni/">you always have useful things to do</a> . <br><br>  If your task is 100 sales calls per day, and you have reached your goal, does this mean that you managed?  Of course no. <br>  There is always something useful that you could accomplish.  It doesn't matter how much you can do in 24 hours. <br><br>  Therefore, do not shirk, do not look for excuses, do not make excuses and, most importantly, be concentrated most of the time.  So you will not be able to break the balance! <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uchebnik-produktivnosti-ot-lezheboki/">Textbook of productivity from a sluggard: 6 ways to goof off, having more time</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299522/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299522/</a></p>
