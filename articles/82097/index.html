      Today it will be just about such a machine, which belongs to the class of personal computers of the initial level or more simply - nettops.  A nettop is usually a device whose dimensions are not far from the box of compact discs of some modest anthology (a 3-4 disk drive).  But, despite its modest size, these are the most real computers capable of performing the most real computer functions. It is logical to assume that the functions are basic - the Internet, music, movies, texts, simple games and even something else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04b/b94/63f/04bb9463f05db869b1c057db98677776.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As the CPU-Z utility says (yes, by the way, the specifications and inscriptions on the beautiful box too), the secret of the success of ASUS's new nettop is the modern dual- <a href="http://syndication.intel.com/DistributeModule.aspx%3Fppc_cid%3DIIP_00975087614%26cc%3DRU%26contentType%3D0">core <b>Intel Atom</b></a> <b>N330</b> <a href="http://syndication.intel.com/DistributeModule.aspx%3Fppc_cid%3DIIP_00975087614%26cc%3DRU%26contentType%3D0"><b>processor</b></a> (with a frequency of 1.6GHz, 1MB L2 cache and a modest 8W heat pack) located on a relatively fresh platform - <b>nVidia ION</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/37f/c15/526/37fc15526fd8be067dc901bd5263dd9d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is the latter that is intended to become an affordable guide to the world of multimedia entertainment;) Well, find out what it is capable of ... for now let's take a look at the specs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/ed7/750/914/ed7750914af7c13f67099b734b42ec22.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  When buying this device (which was surprising - the box is big enough), inside it will be guaranteed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e1/c93/ea1/8e1c93ea17008c0fd4fec47d61fd78ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  - Nettop <b>ASUS Eee Box EB1012</b> ; <br>  - Stand for vertical installation; <br>  - VESA-mount + set of screws; <br>  - Mains wire + power supply; <br>  - Warranty + quick installation guide. <br><br>  Optionally, there may also be a wired keyboard and mouse, a remote control and an IR receiver (USB) to it, an HDMI-to-DVI adapter and an HDMI cable. <br><br>  In the test sample was a mouse and keyboard, but there was no remote and receiver.  The mouse, like the keyboard, is the simplest, but for the first time they will be enough.  True, the keyboard frankly did not like it - first, the arrows are not separated from the rest of the buttons, Fn is to the left of Ctrl, and in general it is kind of noisy, but for some reason I am sure that this is, as usual, a feature of the non-localized engineering sample. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/508/f91/1d4/508f911d45f3f1b2c6ca5d474684d0c0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  VESA-mount was very useful - thanks to him, the device can be securely mounted on the back of the monitor, and then on the desktop will be a minimum of technology and wires.  If this option does not suit, a metal stand formed by an oblate metal ring will come to the rescue.  It (as well as VESA-mount) securely fixes the nettop onto the screw twisted into the base. <br><br>  The power supply is quite small - like a netbook.  You can mark the lack of user manuals in paper form, although it is in the most detailed color form on the Internet. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  In appearance, when compared with similar devices, there is nothing revolutionary.  A flat box with rounded edges, from one end of which an antenna for wireless communication protrudes.  It's nice that the body is made of plastic, which is almost unmarked (in addition to the black color of the body, there is also white). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30a/8a4/75b/30a8a475b8c2fc6f046f8f0a8b4dbd76.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43d/6f6/b90/43d6f6b902158ef3859b84a10077b8ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the front side there is a power button (inside which a bright blue LED is embedded), a card reader, three USB ports (2.0) and two audio jacks (headphones and a microphone). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04d/9a6/7d6/04d9a67d6c0e7880db57b6bff718595f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On top are the main air vents and one USB port and eSATA.  Below is a mounting hole, a place for a Kensington lock, and a hard disk slide, which are fastened to two screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e30/922/58f/e3092258f6de7a4dc49ea5ed3ab21617.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The remaining functionality fell on the back of the nettop - turning (180 degrees) antenna, power connector, two more USB, network port, HDMI, VGA and audio output (3.5mm) with S / PDIF adapter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e9e/600/804/e9e60080443af51c721348a4ea7bbeec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In principle, a very convenient arrangement of elements - in front only those ports that are used most often in everyday life, everything else is ‚Äúwired‚Äù hidden back.  The only thing that I would change is the power indicator (and therefore the button) would move up (so as not to blind from any angle), and the rear power connector would move to the bottom. <br>  It also gave the impression that everything seems to be there, but is there still something missing?  :) In my opinion, the only thing that really could be useful here is a disk drive.  But what is not, that is not - you have to put everything through flash drives or through an external device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46b/308/d1d/46b308d1d2d87af1f924b14ebe0956c3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The case is assembled very reliably and from high-quality plastic - even if efforts are made, the deformations will be insignificant.  The memory cover can be removed easily - the volume can be increased ... but I didn‚Äôt manage to open the device myself :) feeling that something was about to break off, I decided not to tempt fate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/776/00f/249/77600f24994dcf4c056950ce178d3146.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Device operation </h2><br>  In fact, you can find a lot of options for using this baby!  But the most obvious option is to connect to the monitor, resulting in the emergence of a full-fledged working PC.  You can connect to the TV and use the full range of multimedia content already on it ... or just start the morning by viewing your mail / news / weather. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25f/e0a/b09/25fe0ab093e0fe228c004c9dbe3698a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After turning on the device, the hard disk creates the most noise.  From the top of the vents there is warm air - apparently, there is still active cooling inside. <br>  Inside, the operating system is <b>Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium</b> - after the first power up, it is initialized in about 15 minutes.  In the future, the launch of the system to full working condition takes about 40 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a19/a01/e3d/a19a01e3db51cd5442f48776c6f918d2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Initially, I connected the nettop to a FullHD-TV - via HDMI it easily gave out the resolution of 1920x1080 @ 60Hz.  Although when connected via VGA - no more than 1600x1200. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e8/30f/3e3/3e830f3e3763535624a8345a84e0d98b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Honestly, it is very unusual - to see such a large desktop in front of my eyes) And I could not even imagine that the wallpaper, which I had already tired of once, would look something different, in a new way) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/116/fde/5b9/116fde5b9eaeb5344a68b9ef1a2fda03.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/757/7df/b95/7577dfb95c5569b6e9c5c7f67da51091.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What is nice - even with a bunch of wires, the device did not fall and did not outweigh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/55f/e3b/654/55fe3b6541ffbb6dd12a22f217638946.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Immediately the wireless connection was set up, I downloaded a couple of necessary utilities and a VLC player.  By the way, it was difficult to enter the work computer‚Äôs ball ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know what it was, but I couldn‚Äôt type ‚Äú <i>\\ 192 ...</i> ‚Äù on the keyboard in the address bar - instead of a slash, the staff keyboard typed ‚Äú#‚Äù.  So only thanks to the on-screen keyboard) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f6b/143/b11/f6b143b11613afdd31c70433f148a5e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of the non-standard software were <b>ArcSoft Total Media Theater 3</b> and <b>ArcSoft Total Media Center</b> - two programs of similar functionality designed to quickly launch multimedia content and work with it as a whole.  I always respected the software from ArcSoft, but this time it‚Äôs somehow straightforwardly mediocre - many modern players are much more functional and convenient.  On the other hand, these softinki perfectly sharpened by a large diagonal and remote control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/396/422/b18/396422b1869224e0d5217e230a87c72f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, the new <b>EeeManager</b> is a small utility, in which three parameters of the system are located on three tabs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/589/4ca/d7d/5894cad7d332e327be19b07327776638.png" alt="image"><br><br>  According to the system, the performance index turned out to be 3.3 (out of 7.9) and the processor‚Äôs weakest link was the processor, which was quite predictable.  If he had been a little faster, and the index would have been 4.4. <br><br>  Now let's take a little test, for comparison in parrots.  The <b>SuperPi</b> test <b>,</b> before the millionth mark, the nettop passes in 87 seconds, which is comparable to the figures in netbooks - well, it‚Äôs logical, because the processors are similar.  Accordingly, it is not necessary to wait for the exorbitant numbers from the <b>CPU FreeBenchmark</b> test - <a href="">67.52</a> seconds. <br><br>  Interest sake drove the test <b>Futuremark 3DMark 05</b> .  At the standard settings (resolution - 1024x768), 2786 points were obtained, and with a resolution of 1920x1080 - 1890. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c96/044/1a7/c960441a795f665708d4e7ff3eef6a40.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the <b>HDTune Pro test, the</b> hard disk showed the following results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f13/2c0/a26/f132c0a26bdb74f2afa1ae359c93e0e5.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a2/f7a/59d/4a2f7a59d895964f2ee0a3063de622e4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It would be great to turn down the disk volume through AAM (to make the system completely silent), but, like most 2.5 '' disks, this parameter is not editable here. <br><br>  As for the video, there were no problems playing video materials available to me, which is very nice and generally makes the piece of iron a bargain with the background of all kinds of network players. <br>  Awwh how nice to watch movies on a large diagonal) But in a movie more pleasant! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9eb/9eb/b2c/9eb9ebb2c5d8d369c27853aa4b5f4c06.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  - In the configuration there is almost everything to get started; <br>  - Small size and weight of the device - can be hung on the monitor; <br>  - Attractive appearance, reliable assembly; <br>  - The minimum noise during the work; <br>  - Supports 802.11n, HDMI; <br>  - Many USB ports; <br>  - Perhaps the price; <br>  - The most important thing is sufficient performance for basic tasks; <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - There is no manual in paper form; <br>  - HDMI cable should be put in each box;) <br>  - Bright LED on the front panel; <br>  - Lack of drive and Bluetooth-adapter; <br>  - It is very difficult to open the case; <br>  - On the keyboard, the FN key is to the left of the CTRL; <br>  - Modest upgrade options. <br><br>  Actually, almost all the minuses are removable to some extent, except perhaps the latter, it‚Äôs necessary to initially keep in mind that it will be problematic to increase the productivity of such a machine in the future.  Therefore, I‚Äôm even afraid to imagine how many comments will be like ‚Äúfor this money I can collect a full-fledged ...‚Äù) <br><br>  And the price is even nothing - from 13,500 rubles apiece! <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  I agree, for this money you can collect a good desktop ... but then the main highlights of the nettop will disappear - compactness, noiselessness and low power consumption.  Big brother will in any case be bigger, more voracious and noisier, and the tasks on it can be performed all the same. <br>  The new platform has shown itself quite well - in the new NFS at the maximum settings, of course, you cannot train), but the office, the Internet, photoshop, movies are easy.  And the best part is that the device will not ask for a lot of space for its work.  For some reason, and pulls to compare it with the machine Smart - small, but udalenky!  :) <br>  I wouldn‚Äôt take such a device for work just because high performance is sometimes required, and sometimes I want to play.  But parents, perhaps, will buy in the foreseeable future - let them master computer literacy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf6/3ea/c4e/bf63eac4e4082d8ff9477317a21f1f43.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://trendclub.ru//i/favicon.ico" alt="image">  All news about ASUS and Intel first appear on the <b><a href="http://trendclub.ru/">TrendClub</a></b> project - welcome! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/708/9b0/e71/7089b0e71e9d527392e9e21601567905.jpg" alt="image">  And do not hesitate <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/">to join</a> the ranks of fans of the company on Habr√©;) <br><br>  If you forgot something - we agreed not to get angry) <br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82097/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82097/</a></p>
