  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Register IP. Moscow / Region</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are not enough such stories on Habr√©, but, as it seems to me, each of them has its own nuances, therefore all of them are useful. <br>  Being engaged in <nobr>some kind of</nobr> business, probably everyone <nobr>once</nobr> comes to the <nobr>point of</nobr> "bleaching" their business.  What also in most cases allows you to climb a new level.  I'm talking about registration of a legal entity. <br>  The circle of clients has been developed, partnerships have been established, enough experience has been gained and I decided to register.  <nobr>Someone</nobr> said that it is very difficult, <nobr>someone - is</nobr> very simple.  No one was right.  Complexity - in general, can only be assessed by comparison. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Preparation. </h3><br>  Of course moral :) Next, it was necessary to prepare all the documents.  This is a registration application, TIN and passport.  I made a registration application with <a href="http://www.gnivc.ru/Document.aspx%3Fid%3D1124">this program</a> .  I‚Äôll say right away that if you are not a foreign citizen, in the exported file you need to clear the fields typed in Latin letters and remove abbreviations from the list of activities.  Yes, by the way, it is worthwhile to include as many types of activities as possible, in the future it may come about. <br><br><h3>  2. In the battle. </h3><br>  Almost literally. <br>  It so happened that I had to go to MIFNS number 13 in Khimki.  Very busy branch, a lot of people.  People are engaged in re-registration LLC.  Arriving there we went to the notary.  2 hours of queue, 500 rubles and our application is certified. <br>  Then we go to the bank to pay the fee.  The surprise was that the savings bank did not own the details of the MIFNS, which is located in the building next door.  I had to go to the second round, sfotkat details and attributed to the sber. <br>  After payment of state duty, the girl kindly provides a check, which must be presented along with the application.  Another 3 hours of queue and our application is accepted.  We receive a receipt for acceptance of documents.  According to the assurances of the employees of the Inspectorate General Assembly No. 13, the application is considered for 5 days (by the way, this is the maximum period which is indicated in the NKRF).

    <h3>  3. Unforeseen difficulties. </h3><br>  When registering you will need to choose a tax system.  I chose the "simplified" (USN).  So, it is possible to switch to a different tax system once a year, and initially it can be changed within 5 days from the date of issuance of the Certificate of Registration of Phys.  persons like ip.  BUT the problem is that the date of issue! = Date of receipt of the certificate.  It so happened that my testimony was prepared on Wednesday, I was invited to follow him on Friday (2 days after the issue), after standing again for 3 hours I received the answer that the head of the MIFNS did not have time to sign the certificates and they would only be on Tuesday, well, or at best case on monday.  And Tuesday is already 6 days, and without a certificate to submit an application for the transition to the simplified tax system was not possible.  Calmly explaining the situation to the girl who works in the issuing window, I received a phone number for which on Monday I clarified the readiness of my testimony and gladly went to pick it up. <br>  After 3 hours of queuing, I got something for which so much time was spent.  Next, it was necessary to apply for USN.  Attention!  Forms in the tax do not give, they must be downloaded in the internet.  The blessing was a netbook.  The application is written in duplicate, both are filled and submitted, and one stamped is returned. <br><br><h3>  4. Rosstat, pension bank. </h3><br>  A few days later, going to open an account in the bank, I found a letter in the mailbox.  The Pension Fund kindly invited me to visit them, but only taking with them copies of the registration certificate of the IP, TIN, passport and a green pension card.  The letter was postponed and I went to the bank to investigate.  To open a current account of an IP in a bank, the same certificate, an inn, passport and some informational letter with statistics codes from Rosstat are required. <br>  In Rosstat, it is not at all clear what they do, but definitely not work.  According to me, they had to send a request by <nobr>e-mail</nobr> to another city and it took them 2 weeks.  For 2 days, I received a fax from another city responding to this request (without having received it), and I myself already carried this answer to Rosstat.  They initially refused to accept, forcing them to wait 2 weeks (I had to open an account as soon as possible).  But in the end, they accepted and prepared all these statistics codes. <br>  In the pension fund they will immediately tell you to pay :) I was also surprised, I didn‚Äôt seem to work yet, but I had to pay.  You will have to pay an amount in the region of <nobr>600</nobr> rubles per month.  And report back for it in February-March. <br><br>  There is also a need to make a seal, but our legislation does not oblige Ipshnikov to have its own seal.  If, however, you do - it must contain the region, full name and USRNIP (Uniform state registration number of the individual entrepreneur), which is listed on the certificate. <br><br>  I did not plan to accept payments in cash, so I did not bother with the cashier, but simply opened a checking account. <br><br>  <em>In general, the procedure took about 2 weeks <nobr>(4-5</nobr> full days that had to be devoted to this).</em>  <em>I spent on all 900 rubles (notary 500 + duty 400).</em>  <em>Basically, I didn‚Äôt want to use the help of companies that do everything themselves, I wanted to figure everything out myself.</em>  <em>More experience will be.</em>  <em>In the end, I would not say that everything is very difficult, but not easy, because I had to spend a lot of strength and nerve.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76398/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76398/</a></p>
