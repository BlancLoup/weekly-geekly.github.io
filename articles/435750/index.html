Presenters will analyze the propagation of errors when creating an ICO platform and a smart contract, working with Bitcoin and Ethereum on the server side, as well as working with Ethereum in mobile applications (subscriptions, replacing nonce in transactions, reconnecting and typing). <br><br>  <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/events/conference/mini-konferentsiya-po-igrovoy-industrii-gamedev-house/"><b>GAMEDEV.HOUSE</b></a> <br><br>  <b>When:</b> January 20 <br>  <b>Where:</b> Moscow, st.
