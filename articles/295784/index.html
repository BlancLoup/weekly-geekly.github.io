      More than 200 publishers, sports leagues and television networks in 20 countries have already joined the <i>Twitter Amplify</i> platform since its launch in order to effectively and successfully monetize published video content. <br><br>  Up to now, advertisers have had to establish their cooperation through direct deals and agreements with publishers such as <a href="http://www.nfl.com/">NFL</a> , <a href="http://www.mtv.com/">MTV</a> and <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/">Fox Sports</a> .  Twitter is currently expanding the beta program throughout the US so that any publisher can capitalize on their videos with the <b>PRE-ROLL</b> demo feature of video advertisements.  Thus, the new Amplify platform will also include such publishers as <a href="http://www.si.com/">Sports Illustrated</a> , <a href="http://www.aol.com/">AOL</a> , <a href="http://www.voxmedia.com/">Vox Media</a> , <a href="http://www.makerstudios.com/">Maker Studios</a> and <a href="http://www.fullscreen.com/">Fullscreen</a> . <br><br>  It is known that for the period of beta testing of a new platform, many features were available only to a limited circle of large-scale publishers.  Following the results of testing, the company qualitatively improved the functionality and settings of the platform itself, opening up even more opportunities for future advertisers. <br>  Publishers such as the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/">NFL</a> have previously been forced to control the advancing ads themselves, but now, having learned about the new offer from Twitter, they have acquired the opportunity to sell advertising traffic in their video content using the Twitter Amplify platform.  It also includes targeted ad targeting tools for various parameters that have already become useful. <br><br>  It is quite easy to buy media space in video content published by publishers!  To do this, simply select the required type of content and brands, with which you would like to be broadcast, and other parameters already known and used to be marketers for marketers, and then proceed to replenish your account.  In the future, Twitter also plans to include promotional videos in the content that users view daily. <br><br>  From closed beta testing it is known that the possibility of publishing advertising video content in a <i>pre-roll</i> format will become available in the near future not only for advertisers located in the United States, but also in other countries. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295784/</a></p>
