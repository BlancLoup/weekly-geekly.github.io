      According to an employee of MOYO, the first batch of these devices is expected in Ukraine soon, so let's see what we have to deal with. <br><br>  (A lot of pictures under the cut) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  <i><b>Note: it</b> so happened that at that moment I had the first iPad on my hands.</i>  <i>And instinctively I wanted to compare these two devices.</i>  <i>I understand that it is stupid, - nevertheless, a little different equipment plan, but I could not resist.</i>  <i>Therefore, in the course of the review I will draw some comparative parallels.</i>  <i>I ask the supporters of Apple technology in advance not to be offended.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  So, welcome - <b>HTC Flyer</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c0/38/c038a9bb1fe402a4e529bfff7f60e838.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/10/f8/10f8ac998f12be2d0a2a5f3219461182.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/76/79/767993e9fa03e804f663c17622c959e9.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e4/41/e441cad2ebd120624c02f58eb011b590.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  In my hands, this device was transferred without a branded box and packaging, so there was no possibility to photograph the solemn opening ceremony of the test subject.  Therefore, I leave this honor to the future happy owners of this device. <br><br>  Let's start with the specifications ... <br><br><br><h1>  Specifications </h1><ul><li>  <b><u>Dimensions</u> :</b> 195.4mm x 122mm x 13.2mm </li><li>  <b><u>Weight</u> :</b> 420 gr.  with battery </li><li>  <b><u>Platform</u> :</b> Android ‚Ñ¢ with HTC Sense ‚Ñ¢ interface (version 2.2 upgradeable to 3.0) </li><li>  <b><u>Processor</u> :</b> Qualcomm <b>1.5 GHz</b> </li><li>  <b><u>Memory</u> :</b> 1 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal memory for data storage, expansion slot - MicroSD (SD 2.0) </li><li>  <b><u>Display</u> :</b> 7 "touch screen with a resolution of 1024x600 pixels and zoom function </li><li>  <b><u>Camera</u> :</b> Rear - 5 megapixel with autofocus, front - 1.3 megapixel </li><li>  <b><u>Connectivity</u> :</b> Cellular HSPA / WCDMA / Quad-Band GSM / GPRS / EDGE (data only), Wi-Fi (802.11 b / g / n), Bluetooth 3.0 (A2DP), built-in GPS receiver </li><li>  <b><u>Connectors</u> :</b> 3.5mm headphone jack, 12-pin micro USB 2.0 </li><li>  <b><u>Sensors</u> :</b> Position sensor in space (G-sensor), Digital compass, Light sensor. </li><li>  <b><u>Battery</u> :</b> 4000 mAh battery, standby time - up to 820-1470 hours, in video playback mode - up to 4 hours. </li><li>  <b><u>Supported formats</u> :</b> <br>  audio (AAC, AMR, OGG, M4A, MID, MP3, WAV, WMA), <br>  Video (3GP, .3G2, MP4, WMV, AVI [MP4 and MP3-ASP], XviD [MP4 and MP3-ASP]) </li></ul><br><br><h1>  Equipment </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3e/0a/3e0abbcab953620d2e541a266d5df45f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The kit I got included: <br><ul><li>  charging (not collapsible with an adapter, but simply a wire, at the other end of which there is a plug with a power supply). </li><li>  cable to connect the device to the desktop computer (USB - micro USB) </li><li>  headphones </li><li>  stylus </li><li>  white protective case </li><li>  Well, the device itself, in fact. </li></ul><br>  Surely in the boxed version there will be another set of instructions and a CD with software. <br><br><br><h1>  At first sight‚Ä¶ </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/67/6e/676ebaf75487678bfc6042521a7987bf.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/35/31/3531a63c118daed043f63e6c1bd1bc65.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I'll say right away - the device is nice.  I did not see a lot of tablets, but I am always glad to meet good-quality electronics. <br><br>  The device is made with high quality, does not dangle, does not creak, sits comfortably in your hand.  If compared with the iPad, then, unlike Apple‚Äôs ping-pong table (forgive me, Buddha!), The <b>HTC Flyer is</b> smaller and lighter, more comfortably holding with one hand in the air.  At the same time, the new device from HTC has a pleasant and large enough screen for comfortable work in portable mode. <br><br>  The device case is mostly metallic (aluminum), but along the edges, where it is customary to take hands, two white plastic inserts are provided.  It looks nice, and the hand does not slip as much as on metal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d7/77/d7770ef9d5db4a1f6ff2ab228c2e3735.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Pay attention to the relief on the edges of the case.  Due to this protruding edge greatly increases the tenacity with which you can hold the device without fear that it will slip out of hand.  For example, the iPad does not have such a thing, so holding it vertically with one hand is really scary. <br><br>  The seven-inch HTC Flyer screen conveys colors well, the light sensor automatically adjusts the brightness.  In the light of the spring midday sun, of course, the image loses its depth, but visibility does not disappear - everything can be seen.  And, by the way, according to my subjective feelings, the finger on the HTC touch screen slides a little more pleasantly than on the front surface of the iPad.  But a matter of taste and habits, of course ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9c/88/9c88044a7db333130a334b48fa984d10.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Another plus in the direction of compactness is transportation.  Inside its white leather case, the device is comparable in size and weight to a notebook or diary.  There is also a convenient mount for the "magic stylus", like a small ballpoint pen.  The cover itself inside is made of light gray velvety soft material, and is covered with a ‚Äúcover‚Äù on the magnet from above.  Thus, it can be quite convenient to carry it all day with you, even just in your hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/87/21/872114ebb680e5f4f3c707d2e311331d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><br><br><br><h1>  Get acquainted closer </h1>  Let's see what is on the device itself.  We take it as an album (horizontal orientation). <br><br>  Micro USB connector.  Located on the right side, in the center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/4b/e3/4be3dece8427fd84e901a0cd790632cc.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><br>  On the top left side are the volume control buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f9/18/f91802ec86fe4c74cf40af220a0abe82.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><br>  Main rear camera. <br>  It is located, as always, where it is easiest to slap on it with your hands, on the back wall, closer to the left upper edge.  Although the camera is such a special thing that wherever you place it you will grab it everywhere.  Especially since the device has a bidirectional orientation. <br><br>  After some time you get used to the location of the camera and start to take it a little lower - at the same time the hand supports the device better from the bottom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ca/27/ca27c643960b737d06439ce443db3f73.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br>  In front there is another front camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3a/89/3a89c12df58ba5b7e024de38f9a89d33.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br>  On the left, a power button lurked, and with it a headphone jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a3/0c/a30c5456afbe89b3aa304b98a08b3955.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><br>  The speakers are located on the rear wall below.  There are only two of them.  In the photo one of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/79/f2/79f2f99f77226a0ea2b800e6011b0016.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, the manufacturer writes about SRS WOW HD ‚Ñ¢ virtual surround sound technology for these two external speakers.  This does not tell me anything, but I must pay tribute to the guys - the sound is good and loud.  Speech, music - everything sounds decent. <br><br><br><br><h1>  Cameras </h1>  But the 5-megapixel camera on the back of the device, to be honest, was not pleased with the quality of the photographs.  It seems to me that at 5Mpx it would be possible and better to take pictures.  But to judge you - for example, I post two photographs taken by me (the pictures are clickable). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/60/9f/609f870931885d76169b9e6a07b2fc9d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/84/bd/84bdfebd19731d07cd80130f055b513e.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Maybe, of course, I'm just a bad photographer ... And the cat is not fat - it‚Äôs just the light that fell so)) <br><br>  An interesting impression is left by the shooting process itself: I haven‚Äôt yet seen such a large preview window of what happens in the photo (the first iPad has no cameras at all). <br><br>  I liked to make a video - it‚Äôs not bad in quality. <br><br>  As for the front camera, it will be even weaker, but it copes with its task: you can hold video conferences, take your own photos and process them in real time.  To do this, even have a special program <b>SnapBooth</b> , which allows you to add effects to the resulting photo.  Sometimes it turns out very funny - try when the opportunity arises. <br><br><br><br><h1>  Touch menu </h1>  Immediately I apologize for having forgotten to take a picture of the menu separately.  Let's show schematically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e5/a2/e5a24c6d81fcb5be90c19ec86e762639.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  First, the menu is located in two places at once: where it is marked in red with a horizontal orientation and in the place of a blue rectangle - with a vertical one.  The active menu (always only one) is highlighted in a pleasant white color. <br><br>  Secondly, the purpose of the buttons is intuitive - it is easy to understand even without instructions (for example, I didn't have it at all).  And then you get used to it and, ‚Äúlike a cat in a vacuum cleaner,‚Äù you poke your finger without even looking. <br><br>  From left to right: ‚Äúgo to main screen‚Äù, ‚Äúcontext menu‚Äù, ‚Äúback‚Äù.  A little to the right, in a separate red rectangle there is another menu item - in the form of a pencil in a circle.  Clicking on this button opens a set of tools for drawing with the stylus. <br><br><br><br><h1>  Stylus </h1>  The lightweight aluminum stylus has two buttons on it (draw / erase) and a soft plastic tip that allows you to move the pen around the screen without leaving scratches and holes. <br><br>  By the way, the device responds to pressing force.  In the special program "Album", where you can practice in the visual arts, I personally checked it.  Besides the fact that you can choose different tools (pencil, brush, etc.), the stylus does leave a trace of different degrees of saturation depending on the ‚Äúhead‚Äù. <br><br>  For storing the stylus in a leather case there is a special eyelet, from which the ‚Äúmagic pen‚Äù does not fall out, and easily gets at the right time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/45/b2/45b2acc2ed28a1bc43c5de6f790653fd.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/34/67/34675ffe47d2c69419363039e7f7629d.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2e/55/2e55dc0a395278ec039d32f4ce4cab72.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><br><br><h1>  Device Features </h1>  There are several features of this device. <br><br>  Personally, I was primarily interested in the Android operating system - I had never worked with devices based on this OS before.  Now, when I am writing this review, I feel like a ‚Äúnon-asphalted village‚Äù, but nevertheless sometime they are doing something for the first time ... <br><br>  By the way, HTC Flyer works on Android 2.2.  Declared the ability to upgrade to the third version in the future.  And, as I understood, the developers from HTC thoroughly reworked the entire range of standard applications for use on the tablet. <br><br>  <u><b>HTC Sense</b></u> <br>  This is the interface that HTC is proud of.  You could already see it on existing HTC communicators.  It looks beautiful, comfortable to use.  From what I noted: in applications (as in the iPad), two-finger zooming works, the screen reacts to the device rotation (you can block in the settings), inertial scrolling works in the lists - what else is needed for comfortable work?  That's right - a set of necessary programs!  :) But with today's pace of development of this area under Android such a problem should not be.  Well, or, at least, it will not be in the very near future ... <br><br>  <u><b>HTC Watch</b></u> <br>  The service of streaming video, through which you can watch movies online, evaluate, comment.  The assortment of this device is generally a lot for a full social life in the network and fruitful communication.  HTC Watch is one more step in this direction.  By the way, the service seems to be paid. <br><br>  <u><b>HTC Scribe</b></u> <br>  I already mentioned this a little bit earlier.  Now we will know how it is called correctly!  HTC Scribe is a special technology that allows you to use the stylus as a ‚Äúpen‚Äù or a paintbrush.  With HTC Scribe you can draw, take notes absolutely on any screen - you do not need to launch a special application. <br><br>  By the way, by making notes in this way, you can immediately accompany them with audio comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d1/db/d1db6a900cd00a2ba55c06d4119a5653.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><br>  <u><b>Onlive</b></u> <br>  This is great news for gamers.  Thanks to HTC‚Äôs cooperation with <a href="http://www.onlive.com/">OnLive</a> , you can play all the games available on this gaming service on your tablet. <br><br>  And, if you're interested, you can connect HTC Flyer to your TV, add a OnLive wireless joystick here and play like a console.  Here is a transformer tablet. <br><br><br><br><h1>  Several photos of the interface and programs </h1><br>  Screen "standby". <br>  To activate the interface, drag the metal ring at the bottom of the screen with your finger.  You can run one of the ‚Äúquick start‚Äù programs or go to the main screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/44/8b/448b67071d946b4edaf7a33f9a30cb08.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br>  Main screen. <br>  Here everything can be quite flexibly customized for fast work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/07/3b/073b92f627a4d6bc890e68601c00658f.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><br>  List of applications: all frequently used and applications downloaded from the outside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/73/d4/73d49095404e32e08865b6e88ddffe1b.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><br>  The program "Calendar". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5d/f3/5df3fb6b1de9c57ab97a2fc7ff63c507.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  After spending some time behind this device, I did not find any irritating perception factors.  I also did not meet anything superfluous, redundant or inconvenient.  Unless there was some uncertainty and ‚Äúshyness‚Äù in the actions: the device is still new to me, and it is time to get used to the whole new person.  Already at the end of a short-term operation of the ‚Äútest subject‚Äù I realized that I had gotten used to the device for a quick, full-fledged work. <br><br>  Looking through the installed programs did not have difficulty understanding what, where, why and how.  And thinking about what functions the ‚Äúowner‚Äù might need in different circumstances of life, I realized that the existing range of them is more than enough.  I would just add here something from the ICQ and Skype family.  And "preference".  Well or solitaire "kerchief" at the worst ...))) <br><br><br><br><h1>  Some comparative photos </h1>  For those who, like me, love to dump everything in a heap and admire the resulting splendor, I suggest several joint photos of HTC Flyer and iPad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7a/77/7a7761ccb328ec825780e49668c27e1f.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e9/86/e9866f12549febfd497c687843c29f7f.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/49/b4/49b4d3e98438397ea67574a6beccce85.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/23/bf/23bf19eae5eec456a21fd8ebd2684791.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The height (thickness) of the device turned out to be identical.  You can estimate the sizes yourself. <br><br>  I must say, somewhere deep in my heart I was afraid that <b>HTC Flyer</b> would just fade next to the terrible grandeur of the iPad.  But, as it turned out, I was worried for nothing - the device looks quite decent and is not at all going to lose in this curious, but senseless competition.  Just by looking at this picture, you immediately realize that you need to have at your disposal both - each for their own purposes and situations.  Moreover, they work on different operating systems ... <br><br><br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1>  Forgive me the representatives of the company MOYO for the fact that I, perhaps, disclose that which is not supposed to be disclosed.  However, this seems important to me. <br><br>  <b>HTC Flyer</b> is expected in Ukraine at the beginning, maximum - in the middle of summer (2011).  It will cost about 8000 UAH (or $ 1000).  Now, as I understand it, anyone can pre-order and get the device for 7555 UAH. <br><br>  I will not say ‚Äúfor all of Odessa‚Äù - yet I did not see so many different tablets and was not particularly interested in their value.  But personally it seemed to me that the device is worth the money.  90 percent for sure.  Although, I think, having ceased to be a novelty, it will become cheaper.  But precisely due to the fact that the model is ‚Äúfresh‚Äù, all the latest ‚Äúchips‚Äù in it are taken into account.  And this is a plus. <br><br>  Another plus is that the Android OS is coming up in the device to version 3.0, which will also have a beneficial effect on working with it. <br><br>  Overall impressions are very, very positive.  A sort of comfortable, elegant, intelligent and self-sufficient device, and most importantly - easy to use. <br><br>  Of the minuses I can note only two things: <ul><li>  The camera does not quite high-quality pictures.  Therefore, going on a trip, it is better to grab a camera with you. <br><br></li><li>  The two scratches on the device screen made me think that ‚Äúnot all yogurts are equally useful.‚Äù  I recommend to follow what you drive on the screen.  And checking the response to the force of pressing the stylus, too, do not get involved.  If you wish, of course, you can scratch everything.  But still worth paying attention to it.  Perhaps an early protective film will help solve this problem. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/70/90/7090aa5e7e817f64faf0c2259f6112df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br>  <b>Thanks to everyone who read it.</b>  <b>I know, it turned out long.</b> <br>  Special thanks to Dmitry Khamchukov (MOYO) for providing a copy of HTC Flyer. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Link to pre-order: <a href="http://www.moyo.ua/htc">www.moyo.ua/htc</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119842/</a></p>
