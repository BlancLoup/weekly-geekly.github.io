  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The effectiveness of social media. Hoster look</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/telhosting/blog/116779">promised earlier</a> , we decided to share some intermediate results of work in social media. <br><br>  <b>Subject Forums</b> <br>  Practically in every community dedicated to website building, online advertising and website promotion there is a specialized section ‚ÄúHosting‚Äù.  The problem is that usually it is cluttered up with hosters themselves.  Live communication is observed only on <a href="http://forum.searchengines.ru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D575873%26page%3D17">SearchEngines</a> and several more sites.  The sole purpose of many representatives of hosting companies is to simply ‚Äúslip through‚Äù the resource and leave the forum with peace of mind.  Often in the hoster branches have to see that some users ask some questions, but the only answer to them is just another footcloth with updated tariff plans or "superaktsiyami".  Companies do not even bother themselves with such a trifle - as a reaction to very specific customer questions ... For us, the situation with forums looks ambivalent - on the one hand, clients from web communities regularly come to us, but on the other hand, the majority of forum users are interested in virtual hosting services while for a large data center it is much more interesting to sell colocation and dedicated services. <br><br>  <b>Catalogs reviews and ratings hosters</b> <br>  We will also assign directories with ratings to social media tools.  Calculate the number of customers order our services, seeing the information about TEL Hosting in the ratings hosters.  Often, people will find out about hosting somewhere else, and in the reviews directory they are looking for information about a particular company.  This underlines the importance of monitoring such resources and the need to respond to user feedback.  If there are a lot of negative information about the provider in the reviews and there is no official response from the host, this can scare the client a lot. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>IT sections of business forums</b> <br>  The desire to communicate with larger customers led us to the IT sections of the forums on management, business, banking services.  With these resources is not so great.  Few of the visitors were attracted by the data center and data center services.  Apparently, company managers have more important things to do than chat in forums.  On such clients need another way.

      <b>In contact with</b> <br>  Visitors to the most popular Russian-language social network are very passive.  Inside the service almost no content is generated.  After invitations to groups were banned, the promotion of communities lost its relevance - the use of contextual advertising in our subject is too expensive for one to join.  We decided to go the other way - to promote a corporate account.  But this tactic did not bring its success.  The VKontakte audience is not suitable for our purposes - users are actively framing us, but their activity ends there.  On the other hand, it can be noted that the promotion of VKontakte looks very promising for stores, entertainment venues, Internet projects designed for a mass audience. <br><br>  <b>Facebook</b> <br>  Facebook promotion looks like a very dubious event for us.  Here you can also recall how professional SMO companies <a href="http://toxiczero.ru/%3Fp%3D87">attract ‚Äúlive‚Äù users to groups</a> and that the cost of promotion is rather big, and the result, to put it mildly, is very unpredictable ... Even if we are not talking about finding customers on Facebook, but at least about the reputational component - the profitability of this method is very low.  Best of all, this can be demonstrated by the statistics of Russian-speaking corporate communities.  A total of <a href="http://www.socialbakers.com/facebook-pages/brands/russia/">36 corporate pages</a> in the Russian-language FB have over 5,000 fans, and this despite the fact that the list includes the world's largest brands with millions of customers.  It is doubtful that such a number of visitors can significantly affect brand awareness and even more so on sales.  For everybody on VKontakte, several thousand participants in a group are the standard figure for a group of some small nightclub.  And here we can talk about some kind of efficiency.  In the case of Facebook, for now, it‚Äôs more like SMM marketers trying to pass what they want into reality. <br><br>  <b>Twitter</b> <br>  We have more serious expectations for the microblogging service.  Readers with the desire and ability can be brought free of charge, a minimum of bells and whistles, convenient functionality.  However, we noticed that other hosting companies are mainly used to respond to customer comments during the server crash.  Fortunately, this is not the case with us (falls), therefore users do not write to us.  The audience is active, targeted.  As a negative point, it is worth noting deliberately biased attitude to corporate blogs.  Twittermen are not very willing to communicate and go to a dialogue with us.  Perhaps the fact is that the name of the company ‚ÄúTELHosting‚Äù was chosen as a nickname and this official name scares users away; on the other hand, it is much easier to identify a twig blog with our company. <br><br>  <b>Livejournal</b> <br>  We recently started working with Livejournal.com.  The site has a good potential, a large number of serious people from the target audience, but here there is a similar problem with Twitter - people are initially negatively disposed towards corporate brands, therefore they are friendly and communicate, albeit with ‚Äúunformatted‚Äù and humane <a href="http://telhosting.livejournal.com/">telhosting.livejournal.com</a> .  It‚Äôs too early to draw serious conclusions, a matter of time plays an important role here so that we first get to know about and talk about.  The example of TCS Bank is <a href="http://tcsbank.livejournal.com/">indicative in this regard</a> , although we don‚Äôt have Tinkov and Anisimov ... <br><br>  <b>Habrahabr</b> <br>  Habr - so far a mystery to us.  Here a huge number of Russian-speaking IT specialists are concentrated, with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">habrahabr.ru</a> we constantly get a large number of transitions, but it‚Äôs too early to talk about converting to customers.  This community is more suitable for communication with customers and increasing brand mentioning than for direct marketing of services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117696/</a></p>
