  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google continues to etch unwanted Android developers?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr√© already there were articles devoted to every possible reprisals from Google in relation to developers.  However, it seems that the corporation of good has acquired new methods of dealing with developers that it does not like. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Prehistory</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  On July 24, I received a letter stating that one of my applications was deleted due to a <a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html">violation of the provision for free and paid applications</a> and clause <a href="http://www.android.com/us/developer-distribution-agreement.html">3.3 of the</a> agreement.  In other words, Google found that my free application uses third-party payment systems.  In the application itself there were no third-party payment systems.  It was: <br><ol><li>  In-app billing from Google for lifelong outage </li><li>  Link to a website where you can deposit funds not through Google </li></ol><br>  Of course, the second point is a bad decision, and probably this is what they did not like.  When I was looking for information on this issue, I found answers like ‚Äúin such a system nobody cares about what is on your site, as long as the application does not have it‚Äù.  Evernote was cited as an example.  I did not check the information, I trusted this reasoning and, apparently, it became my main mistake. <br>  The letter said that I could correct the error and unload the updated application with a different package name.  I immediately removed the link to the site and unloaded the corrected application.  At the same time, I sent them a letter asking them to see if everything is in order and to give an opportunity to correct them if something is suddenly wrong.  A few minutes later came the ticket that the letter received in processing.  After 4 hours, a message arrived that the new application was blocked for the same reason.  And after another 20 hours, a letter arrived that the entire developer account was already blocked due to repeated violations of the rules and agreements.  Also in the letter it was said that you should not try to register a new account, because we will still calculate, ban you again, and don‚Äôt refund the registration fee;  If you please use other ways to distribute your applications. <br>  Next, there were appeals to Google and numerous letters to me from users who asked where this or that application disappeared.  Some of these users subsequently wrote to the Google Play customer support service with requests to return the applications, for which they were rejected in the spirit of "we know nothing, it was either the developer himself deleted the applications, or he broke the rules."  Some particularly stubborn users were later sent to write to the developer support service, from where they already answered that this application is not yours, let the author write.  My appeals were rejected with a template note, which can be briefly described as "we looked, you violated, we will not change the decision and do not write to us anymore."  It must be said that, in general, all the answers are always stereotyped and it seems that appeals are not read in principle. </div></div><br>  Two months have passed since my developer account was blocked on Google Play.  Having a little forgotten about all this, I managed to study various alternative stores and rewrote one of the applications (the one banned) under Windows Phone.  And here, on September 30, a letter arrives from AdMob with the following text: <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  We‚Äôre notifying you that one of your applications is currently not in compliance with the AdMob program policies, and therefore the display of ads in it has been disabled. <br>  Problem ID: 12345678 <br>  The application in which the display was turned off ads: MyApp2 (ru.bartwell.myapp2) <br>  Necessary measures: check whether the rest of your applications comply with the program rules. <br>  Current account status: active <br><br>  <u>Clarification of a rule violation</u>

      REMOVING GOOGLE PLAY.  AdMob publishers are prohibited from violating the rules of Google products, such as Google Play, YouTube and Blogger, or provoking such violations.  Among other things, by this means means to circumvent the rules of Google (for example, programs for downloading videos from YouTube). <br>  If your application has been removed due to a violation of Google Play rules, <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/troubleshooter/2993242">please contact us.</a>  <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/troubleshooter/2993242">If your application has been restored, <s>send an appeal to</s></a> our team. <br><br>  Necessary measures: check whether your account complies with the rules of the program <br>  We‚Äôve turned off ad serving in the above application, but your AdMob account is still active.  We recommend that you check whether the rest of your applications comply with the program rules and regularly monitor their status.  This will help avoid the recurrence of similar problems.  We draw your attention to the fact that we reserve the right to disconnect an account at any time if violations are detected again. <br><br>  Appeals <br>  To appeal the disconnection of your account, fill out this <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/contact/policy_violation_appeal">form</a> . <br>  Thank you for your cooperation. <br>  Respectfully, <br>  Google AdMob Team </blockquote><br><br>  All the markup of the letter is fully preserved.  Changed only the name of the application, so as not considered for advertising. <br><br>  The most interesting and important is that this is not the application that was banned for breaking the rules.  This is a <b>completely different</b> application that was on the same Google Play account.  That is, it turns out that now you can not participate in AdMob, if your Google Play account is banned.  And it‚Äôs likely that I just have to wait while AdMob gradually interrupts all the rest of my applications in which there was advertising.  And I could not find an item in the AdMob rules about the ‚Äúdelete Google Play‚Äù described in the letter. <br><br>  PS By the way, the same application has been available for 10 months on the AppStore (and now on the Windows Phone Store) without any problems. <br><br>  Update.  Today, on October 8, a notification about the bath of the next application came from AdMob. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/238899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/238899/</a></p>
