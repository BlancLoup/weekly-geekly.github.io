  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex has calculated the most active users of electronic money</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yandex has published a large study of the market of electronic payments on the Russian Internet ( <a href="http://download.yandex.ru/company/yandex_on_emoney_autumn_2007.pdf">PDF</a> ).  The work is based on the Yandex.Money payment system, but some indicators (for example, the ratio of payments for goods and services, the payment structure, the behavioral profile of the most active users, etc.) can be considered common to all payment systems.  The report covers statistics from the summer of 2006 to the summer of 2007. <br><br>  Some interesting facts.  The most expensive products, for which they pay with electronic money, are appliances and flowers, especially in September (the average cost of a bouquet in September 2006 reached 7,000 rubles).  But in general, almost no one pays for the goods, and usually only cellular communication, hosting and other services are paid through the Internet.  The most active category of payers is the tenants. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Over the five years of Yandex.Money, users have completed over 15 million transactions through this system.  User activity is growing - the number of transactions in July 2007 is more than 2 times higher than in July 2006.  On average, on one day of July 2007, 2000 new wallets were opened in the Yandex.Money system and more than 20 thousand transactions took place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/ca8/0b2/a63/ca80b2a63ddb36d3bc5e2ea8c4d525ee.gif" width="395" height="328" hspace="10" vspace="10">

      Electronic money in Russia pays much more for services than goods.  Obviously, this is because services are intangible, like e-money.  If it is natural for e-currency to pay for mobile communications, access to information or an online game for most users, they still prefer to pay for goods purchased from online stores in cash upon delivery.  During the analyzed year, the ratio of the number of payments for goods and services did not change.  Payments for goods accounted for 4% of the total number of payments both in June 2006 and June 2007. <br><br>  The ratio of payments for goods and services has changed slightly.  If a year ago, 5% of the total volume of payments was paid for the goods, now it is 6%.  It can be concluded that users' interest in goods remains at the same level, but now they are ready to pay with electronic money for more expensive items. <br><br>  <b>Payment structure</b> <br>  Russian users of electronic payment systems often pay for cellular communication.  Every second payment in the Yandex.Money system is for a mobile phone. <br><br>  About 70% of all electronic payments (by the number of payments) accounted for five types of services.  In addition to cellular communications, this includes advertising, Internet access, online games, and hosting.  Another 20% are P2P payments (transactions between users' wallets). <br><br>  The remaining 10% are divided between books and music (both on tangible media and in the form of files), television, information services (this also includes online dating, statistics, translations) and software.  Payments for purchases and gifts (that is, all products offered by online stores, except books and music), insurance, courses and trainings, utilities and contributions to charity together make up only 1% of the total number of payments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/6f8/0de/36e/6f80de36e6006998c1ef8550b75ea613.gif" width="448" height="438" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  If you look not by the number of payments, but by their volume, then one third of the total turnover of the Yandex.Money system falls on P2P payments.  Another 57% of turnover is distributed between the same five most popular types of services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/6f5/596/8f0/6f55968f006f41eba9245aafb6489948.gif" width="395" height="437" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Half of all active users of the Yandex.Money system during the last year paid for goods and services of only one type (for example, only for games or only for advertising) and less than one percent used goods and services of ten or more different types. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e5f/c68/163/e5fc68163d22714ca2f93f278d0dc27b.gif" width="422" height="311" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  The average user Yandex.Money paid two different vendors over the past year (not necessarily from different market segments).  The record was set by one user, whose last name is kept secret.  For the year he paid for goods and services from 31 suppliers. <br><br>  <b>Typical profiles</b> <br>  1. Consumers of cellular communication. <br><br>  Payers for a mobile phone are the most numerous group of users of payment systems.  24% of users who pay for a mobile phone also pay for the services of Internet providers.  Another 12% pays for hosting. <br><br>  2. Advertisers and web studio clients. <br><br>  46% of buyers of online advertising and web studio services pay for cellular communication, 27% for hosting, 24% for Internet and telephony. <br><br>  3. Internet users. <br><br>  51% of payers for Internet and IP-telephony, pay for mobile cellular communication, 14% - for hosting, 11% - for advertising. <br><br>  Hosting is paid mainly by users of Garant-Park-Telecom, Corbina Telecom and Zenon N.S.P. <br><br>  4. Players. <br><br>  People who play games are the most "closed" group of users.  In addition to games, they are practically not interested in anything.  36% of players pay for cellular communication, but in all other groups this figure is even higher, since mobile communication is the most popular direction. <br><br>  The most popular (and in terms of the number and volume of payments) are ‚ÄúTerritory‚Äù, ‚ÄúLegend: Legacy of Dragons‚Äù, ‚ÄúRF-online‚Äù and ‚ÄúDozory‚Äù. <br><br>  5. Hosting users. <br><br>  57% of users who pay for hosting with electronic money, also pays for cellular communication.  32% pay for Internet access (preferring Stream from Comstar-Direct), and 28% for advertising.  It can be assumed that the owners of ‚Äúhome‚Äù Internet projects pay for access to the Internet, and entrepreneurs pay for advertising. <br><br>  6. Software Buyers. <br><br>  55% of program buyers pay with electronic money for cellular communication, 30% for the Internet, 20% for books and music. <br><br>  90% of all purchases are made at the Softkey store - even 17% of the buyers of the ANK.ru store (the second most popular) and 32% of the SoftLine Internet Trade (the third most popular) are shopping there. <br><br>  7. The tenants. <br><br>  Users who pay electronic money for utility services are the most active.  Almost no one pays only for housing and public utilities - 95% of users of this group pay for cellular communication.  In addition, 62% pay for Internet and telephony, 24% each for hosting and books, 18% order advertising, 7% pay for television and 3% make purchases on the Internet. <br><br>  The average user Yandex.Money replenishes its online wallet once every two months.  Twice a quarter, he makes payments for goods and services, and P2P operations only once every eight months. <br><br>  The owners of electronic wallets most often make their first payment after registration in the system for cellular communication.  38% of payers for mobile communications have registered in the Yandex.Money system specifically to pay for the services of cellular operators with electronic money. <br><br>  At the same time, more than half of the people who now pay with electronic money for the services of Internet providers and online games made their first payments for them, that is, for this they got their wallets (56% for each of these areas). <br><br>  In the first half of 2007, each user replenished his wallet on average three times.  The average amount of one transfer is 1300 rubles.  Usually about seven thousand replenishments occur every day. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13894/</a></p>
