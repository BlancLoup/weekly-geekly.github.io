I hope that there will be an audience here, which, with the phrase "role-playing," imagines something different from the girl with a whip in latex ... If you thought about it, then you will most likely not be interested in reading. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">In fact, we are talking about this.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef3/838/031/ef383803161744d6bb266fd891908f66.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A shot from the movie The Gamers delightful series. <br></div></div><br>  Read on?  Fine!  Surely you have been playing DnD, WoD, warhammer or some other good game for years.  I have been playing for several years in different settings of the World of Darkness - however, the post will be about universal chars, and not some specific system. <br><br><h2>  Formulation of the problem </h2><br>  If you play for a long time, you know that the papers tend to be lost, destroyed, sometimes it is very difficult to pick up the latest events (new stats, experience, etc.), and it‚Äôs a shame to lose all this.  Me too.  The thought of an electronic jelly comes to mind immediately.  Of course, some of them are on the Internet, but I was not satisfied with any of the proposed.  Why?  Let's estimate the requirements. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  It should be edited online.  Because what the hell is different? </li><li>  It should be possible to share the charnik on the masters of other interested persons. </li><li>  He must be beautiful.  For example, Mr Gone's Character Sheets used by everyone for the World of Darkness look <a href="https://mrgone.rocksolidshells.com/pdf/CtD/Changeling1-Page_Sluagh_Editable.pdf">like this</a> (carefully, by reference the heavy pdf).  Electronic should be no worse. </li><li>  It must be adequately printed.  The electronic version is good, but nothing replaces the warm lamp sheet on the table. </li><li>  He should have a notion of revisions.  Audits should have comments, the ability to compare and restore. </li><li>  Desirable to leave comments. </li><li>  An auxiliary algorithm is desirable for generating a new character.  In power generation systems, the devil himself will break his leg, and checking 10 times whether you have distributed the glasses correctly is very sad. </li><li>  It should be possible for anyone to make an arbitrary charnik.  Well, or should be from the start a full set of required Charnik. </li></ul><br>  Unfortunately, the full set of these requirements (even without considering the ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù ones) does not satisfy anything.  Therefore, two years ago, I decided that I would quickly make my system to work with the chambers.  Hmmm, quickly ... How wrong I was. <br><br><h2>  Decision </h2><br>  In general, how long, how short - I made such a system.  At the time of two years ago, she was in PHP + MySQL, and used JQuery + Bootstrap to display all sly goodness.  Immediately I ask you not to throw rotten tomatoes - I am a backender, and not a fronder, so I did on the fact that I got my arm.  But what was done was a big plus - it works and implements all my Wishlist: <br><br><ul><li>  The ability to add any beautiful Charnik.  Charniki themselves are autonomous entities written purely in HTML + CSS + JS. </li><li>  Charniki can be printed, although for this it was necessary to greatly pervert in some places; </li><li>  There is authorization through Google and the ability to give access to the Charnik; </li><li>  <a href="">There are revisions</a> with the ability to roll back and <a href="">view the changes</a> ; </li><li>  There is a possibility of commenting; </li><li>  Looks great with a tablet and even a phone; </li></ul><br>  As an example - this <a href="">is what the mortal mortar looks like</a> , and this <a href="">is how the vampire glass has been styled</a> as vampire the requiem. <br><br>  It turned out incredibly convenient, but creating a beautiful charnik of time takes nemeryanno.  Therefore, I threw the bait in a couple of communities for joint completion ... But there were no enthusiasts.  So I stopped at these two chests. <br><br>  So why am I writing this post two years later?  I still hope for the help of the gaming community, and a good occasion has come up.  The other day, I decided to fix a minor bug in a charnik for mortals ... And I came to my senses only when I made a charnik with the help of Node.JS, gulp, babel and browserify.  Alas, it is not in my power to completely clear JQuery, since I do not own all sorts of good things like Angular, React, Vue and so on - and it will take a long time to look for and finish new components for the new stack.  However, a start has been made - you can write on ES6, jQuery Deferreds were replaced by bluebird Promises, HTTP requests instead of JQuery are implemented using request-promise, some dependencies are now pulled from npm, and so on.  I almost did not work on refactoring the code ‚Äî the task was simply to start a version two years ago ‚Äî so there is a certain amount of horror there.  But I repeat - this code has a big plus - it works! <br><br><h2>  Plans </h2><br>  Theoretically, there are quite a few plans: <br><br><ul><li>  Make a mock for HTTP requests from the charnik, so that you can fully test the charnik without interacting with the service; </li><li>  Crawl to some adequate frontend stack; </li><li>  Make more beautiful good charnik; </li><li>  Rewrite the backend of the service itself on Node.JS. </li></ul><br>  Practically, time is insanely short, and in splendid isolation I will only finish things that are useful to me with the same frequency once every two years. <br><br>  I would like to write that you can do all sorts of good things for donations - but alas, it takes too long, and it is very expensive.  So I hope only for the enthusiasm of developers.  If you are interested, I will be very happy to participate.  Themies themselves are in open source on github, MIT license.  If you want to use them for something else - I am only for - but tell me, it‚Äôs curious! <br><br><h2>  Links </h2><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://charsheet.su/">System</a> </li><li>  The same in the form of an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.jehy.charsheetsu">Android application</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="https://mrgone.rocksolidshells.com/">The author of the design</a> that I used; </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/jehy/WOD-Mortal-charsheet">Mortar's Charnik</a> - fresh rework; </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/jehy/wod-vampire-requiem-charsheet">A beautiful vampire Charnik</a> , without Node.JS. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402031/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402031/</a></p>
