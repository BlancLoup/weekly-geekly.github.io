My name is Roman Dvornov, I am Lead Engineer in the Frontend Architecture team in Avito.  We are engaged in the creation and development of a technical frontend platform, so that other teams can quickly create interfaces and products.  My colleagues and I have planned a series of online, in which we will discuss topical issues of developing the client side. </p><br><p>  December 11 on our YouTube channel will be the first live broadcast.  Discuss the infrastructure frontend.  Experts from Yandex, Tinkoff, Mail.Ru and Avito will take part in the discussion.  Under the cut - sample questions that we plan to discuss (complete the list), and a link to the upcoming broadcast.  Add a post to your bookmarks: after the meeting, update it and post the video. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8m/yh/w4/8myhw4zcttjte-vdyseamykvico.jpeg"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="primernye-voprosy-dlya-obsuzhdeniya">  Sample questions for discussion </h1><br><p>  Predicting the course of the discussion is always difficult.  But the list of participants and the presenter portend an interesting conversation.  Let's try to talk about the technological stack, project architecture, modularity, dependency management, testing, assembly, deployment, automation, tuling, etc.  In general, everything that projects encounter when they become large and serious products, and issues of control over the situation and increasing the efficiency of work on projects arise very sharply.
