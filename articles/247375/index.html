At the moment, I have 3 active projects, in the process of development and promotion of which I have figured out some nuances and free-floating reefs, which I will talk about in this and subsequent articles. <br>  From my previous publications, I want to advise an article titled ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182138/">How I haven‚Äôt slept a year or creating a social Android application,</a> ‚Äù in which I described my first experience in promoting my own product.

    <h4>  <b>Let's start with free promotion methods:</b> </h4><br>  1) <b>Getting into the tops</b> : top paid, top free, bestsellers, new paid, new free ... The list of tops for different countries is not the same.  Once in the top (not lower than the 50th place), additional traffic will come to your application and the higher the position - the more traffic.  For a free application, getting into the tops provides the number of daily settings, for a paid one, the daily income.  Read more about this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/210632/">here</a> . <br>  2) <b>Search Google Play</b> .  By optimizing the icon, name and description in the market, you can attract additional traffic.  Analyze competitors.  Experiment. <br>  3) <b>Forums</b> : creating topics, answering user questions.  For me, the forum is a convenient way to quickly and efficiently communicate with users for the prompt implementation of the new functionality and the correction of application errors. <br>  4) <b>Reviews on sites</b> : sending out letters asking for a review.  The effectiveness of this method depends on many factors, such as: the interest of the idea and the implementation of the application, the availability of the finished review text, the desire and mood of the administration.  Nevertheless, it is worth trying. <br>  5) <b>Advertising in other applications, cross-advertising</b> .  All services have the same general principle: ‚ÄúThe more ad impressions you get from someone else, the more your ad will show.‚Äù  Make advertising in your application efficient and not annoying. <br>  Currently the most common services are: TapJoy, ChartBoost, AppFlood, TapForTap <br>  6) <b>Social networks</b> : Facebook, VKontakte, Google+, YouTube, Twitter. <br>  The main advantage of social networks is the ease of disseminating information among friends, colleagues, relatives who have a certain level of trust. <br>  Banner advertising in social.  networks, as practice shows, is ineffective and also requires significant costs. <br>  Usually soc.  Networks offer for each project to create a separate group (page).  I think it is more expedient to use and promote my personal page as a person and developer.  In this case, the above is not only the trust and responsiveness of users, but also the desire to join the group (add you as a friend). <br>  To attract attention outside your page, you can use posting in other open Android communities.  The main thing is to be attentive and not to violate their rules. <br><br><h4>  <b>Efficiency increase:</b> </h4><br>  1) <b>Translate applications into more languages</b> .  I usually translate Google Play into: English, Arabic, Dutch, Greek, Danish, Hebrew, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Korean, German, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian, French, Hindi, Czech, Swedish, Japanese . <br>  The interface is, at the moment, translated into: English, Spanish, Italian, German, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian and French, providing a large enough audience.  Almost in every new update, I add a new language, which gives prerequisites for further growth. <br>  The button ‚ÄúHelp with translation into the native language‚Äù turned out to be convenient and useful by clicking on which the creators of the application receive a letter indicating the language into which the user is ready to help translate the application.  After that, a file is sent to the user for translation.  Thus, by the efforts of the users themselves, the application was translated into German, French and Italian. <br>  2) <b>Delight</b> users with new <b>updates and improvements</b> as often as possible.  I recommend doing this every 5 days.  During this time, most of the errors and shortcomings manifest themselves, but they still do not have time to forget about the application.  After installing the application, your main goal is to keep the user. <br>  3) <b>Bring the Google Play page into a presentable form</b> . <br>  The icon should be clear and understandable, as well as stand out from the crowd. <br>  The first two sentences of the description should convince the future user that this is exactly what he was looking for.  The description should be easy to read and beautifully decorated, with key points highlighted in bold. <br>  Creating a demo video is also required.  I believe that the main purpose of the video is to intrigue the user, to show him something unusual, unexpected.  If you succeed in this, then consider that the installation is in your pocket. <br>  4) Keep the <b>rating of the application</b> at a level not lower than 3.8.  Applications rated lower are usually ignored by users as unfinished or not working.  For increase of a rating not free services are usually used.  On average, this will cost $ 0.5 - $ 2 for one rating and a positive comment. <br>  5) Pay <b>maximum attention</b> and time to constructive <b>comments and criticism of</b> users on Google Play, forums, social.  networks.  <b>Chat</b> with your users. <br><br><h4>  <b>Promotional options used:</b> </h4><br>  1) Google Play page is reduced to a decent view.  Optimized for search. <br>  2) Added an advertising banner in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ua.makeev.lovewidgetfree">previous application of a</a> similar theme. <br>  3) Threads are created on the four most popular forums. <br>  4) Sent letters to all well-known domestic and foreign editors sites. <br>  5) Each update is accompanied by posts in the social.  networks. <br>  6) Posted posts in the open, similar in topic groups. <br><br><h4>  <b>Results:</b> </h4><br>  1) Top 25 new free ones in the Widgets category.  Thanks to this position, for almost the entire month, the application received 300-500 installations of each.  On April 2, the application disappeared from this top, which significantly affected the installation schedule. <br>  2) $ 930 - monthly income. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/3cd/900/ac13cd90032e4773b6b4fab2f34242b2.png" alt="image"><br>  (daily profit chart) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03b/64f/fb0/03b64ffb028340beb393828c53aa7a1e.png" alt="image"><br>  (graph of the number of installations of the free version by day) <br><br><h4>  <b>Tips:</b> </h4><br>  1) Communicate as closely as possible with users in the initial stages. <br>  2) Tell about the application wherever possible. <br>  3) Release updates more often. <br>  4) The application must be 100% ready. <br>  5) Conduct final testing of the application with people who really need it. <br><br><h4>  <b>Future goals:</b> </h4><br>  1) Find a way to Chinese and Japanese audiences. <br>  2) Increase income to $ 2000 per month. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> If you have any questions or suggestions, write them in the comments or me personally.  I will answer with pleasure. <br><br><h4>  <b>Literature:</b> </h4><br>  1) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182138/">How I have not slept a year or the creation of a social Android application</a> <br>  2) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/210632/">Promotion of Android applications, rankings and rankings in the tops of Google Play</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247375/</a></p>
