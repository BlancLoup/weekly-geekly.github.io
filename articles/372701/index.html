Today we announce the most severe of our conferences, which will be held on October 8 in St. Petersburg.  It is devoted to extreme situations in IT-projects: in planning, management, development and support.  The program includes reports from Medusa and Vkontakte, the history of creating a video surveillance system at the elections, analysis of failures in project management, predictive modeling of critical situations with serious social consequences, confrontation between designers and wives of customers, and several more stories.  All the hardcore, even coffee breaks! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>IT NonStop</b> is a series of international IT conferences conducted by DataArt in 10 cities of Russia, Ukraine and Poland.  In each city, IT NonStop has its own theme and its own format, but all conferences are united by a single <i>case after case</i> approach ‚Äî the speakers talk about specific solutions and cases. <br><br>  <b>Conference site</b> <a href="http://it-nonstop.net/">it-nonstop.net</a>

      <b>PROGRAM</b> <br><br>  <b>Samat Galimov</b> , technical director of Medusa, was previously the technical director of Bookmate. <br>  <b>Dmitry Zakharov</b> used to work in Undev and banking structures, and now he controls software and hardware in Medusa. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe system is on a cache, OR HOW Medusa serves 5 million readers and more than 100 terabytes of traffic, spending less than $ 500 a month to do so.‚Äù <br>  In the report, we will talk about the architecture of Medusa and carefully look at one of its key links - the caching system. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Krivenkov</b> <br>  Head of all video surveillance projects at Restrim.  Corn from the origins of DataArt and Mail.ru.  In recent years, engaged in projects that are somehow related to the transfer, storage and recognition of audio and video.  Among them - Moskva.fm, Piter.fm, Zombobox, Admonitor. <br><br>  "How in three months to write a system that will broadcast video from two hundred cameras and show it to five million Russians." <br>  In 2012, Krivenkov‚Äôs company, on the order of Rostelecom, in a record short time, created a video surveillance system for elections, which is now used, for example, during the Unified State Exam.  How they did it - in a report on IT Hardcore. <br><br>  <b>Denis Nasonov</b> <br>  Lecturer, Senior Developer of the Institute of High-Tech Computer Technologies at ITMO University.  Denis develops decision support systems in critical situations with serious social consequences (acts of terrorism, criminal activity) and models the reaction of groups of people to external stimuli (panic during fires, floods or epidemics). <br><br>  "From Big Data to Predictive Modeling." <br>  The crowd is a complex system, and predicting the behavior of a large number of people until recently was an impossible task.  The revolution here was made by a combination of computer modeling and methods of working with Big Data.  Why are religious festivals in India, collecting millions of pilgrims, pass without a crush, and the slightest miscalculation in the logistics of a music festival can lead to a terrible tragedy?  How does crowd flow modeling help urban health? <br><br>  <b>Evgeny Efimov</b> <br>  QA lead, DataArt.  He started his career in the 10th grade as an IT director, in 2003 he got tired and downshift to QA-trainee in DataArt.  Then he worked at BridgeQuest, but the call of the Motherland was stronger, and in 2010 he returned to DataArt.  I have always worked in the field of QA in various roles and positions: QA, BA, PM, pre-sales. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCrash test for the manager.  What are the main mistakes PM can make by taking on more than it can bear. ‚Äù <br>  To prevent a train crash, it‚Äôs not enough to know how to design trains.  It is very useful to analyze the causes of known crashes, take them into account and try to prevent them in the future.  I will tell you about my own wreckage and almost the wreckage of several projects and what conclusions I could draw from this. <br><br>  <b>Vyacheslav Mikhailov</b> <br>  Solutions Architect, DataArt.  Engaged in software development for over 18 years.  He worked in various industries: finance, information security, travel.  He started development on .NET in 2000, when the first beta versions of the platform appeared. <br><br>  "Limited Concurrency Multitasking". <br>  In the process of working on a large product, an interesting task arose - to run many tests that had different nontrivial dependencies among themselves.  Tests should be performed with maximum efficiency, occupying all the allowed computing resources.  At the same time inside the tests used asynchronous network interaction and could work for a long time.  In the report, I will talk about how we coped with problems in implementation that arose due to the limitation of the number of used cores and the features of the Task Parallel Library. <br><br>  <b>Valentina Krupaderova</b> <br>  Trenes-consultant on project management in the company ‚ÄúSCAUT-Academy‚Äù.  In IT since 2006 as a developer, from 2011 as a manager.  The leader of the community of IT-trainers in St. Petersburg.  Member of the program committee of the conference CEE-SECR 2016. Regular speaker at conferences on project management. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHow did we get here?  How managers complicate a project. ‚Äù <br>  Not every project at the very beginning looks like a tough one, but almost every one looks like this in the end.  Why?  Okay, we all know about the fact that the project‚Äôs environment is unpredictable, but it‚Äôs somehow embarrassing for adults to blame everything on the fact that ‚Äúthe world is complicated‚Äù.  What decisions of managers can turn and turn a normal project into hardcore with rework, exits from the budget, stress and conflicts in a team?  What kind of immutable rules, applied without understanding, lead to this?  If you are sure that you know exactly why you can‚Äôt add developers to the late project, come, we have something to talk about. <br><br>  <b>Anastasia Rezhepp</b> <br>  The head of the design studio DataArt.  I came to the DataArt design studio nine years ago.  Prior to that, she worked as art director of the Peterlink.Web design studio, spent a year at Bauhaus-Dessau, a center for research, teaching, and experimental design, taught web design, and wrote articles about him and on other topics. <br><br>  <b>Artem Sanzharevsky</b> <br>  Senior designer, DataArt.  15 years in design, 7 years in IT.  Preaches interactive marketing and branding.  Believes in love between designers and front-end developers. <br><br>  "On the fight against chaos, or how to get a good product when the human factor is against you." <br>  The client decided to create a new bomb app, but he still doesn‚Äôt know about what?  Started the project with some stakeholders, and on the way they were replaced by others with completely different ideas?  Is there a designer on the client side too?  Director's wife constantly gives advice on the appearance of the application?  Will the design studio succeed in doing a good thing in all these situations, or will it be necessary to consistently destroy the wife, another designer and stakeholders? <br><br>  <b>Vyacheslav Shebanov</b> <br>  Developer "Vkontakte".  He is fond of functional and reactive programming, programming of distributed systems.  Co-founder of the online newspaper "Paper", one of the organizers of the monthly meetings of SPb Frontend. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Chistyakov</b> <br>  Senior Developer, DataArt.  Co-organizer of the St. Petersburg Devops mitap, DevOps-40.  Three times worked in DataArt.  Engaged in the operation and support of the process of developing complex information systems: large websites, analytical clusters.  Works again in DataArt. <br><br>  You can register <a href="https://itnonstop2016.timepad.ru/event/374352/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372701/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372701/</a></p>
