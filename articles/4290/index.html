At the same time, in the first half of 2006, there was a small but steady influx of attention to voice communication programs.  From quarter to quarter, the number of people visiting blogs and online shopping is growing.

      At the same time, the network interests of men and women are still somewhat different.  For example, men more often than women download files (78% versus 70% respectively).  They numerically lead in the pursuit of financial transactions via the Internet (16% versus 8%) and online games (13% versus 7%).  They also apply to voice communication programs more (10% versus 6%).  Women, in turn, more actively manifest themselves in blogging (14% vs. 9%). <br><br>  The respondents of the older age group (from 35 years old) were more often than the average in the sample looking for information.  Teenagers and young people are more “pumping”, playing games, keeping “live magazines”, participating in forums, chats, etc.  They are the main users of IM services, but customer activity is shown more restrained than mature people, many of whom make purchases on the Web and undertake financial transactions. <br><br>  Another aspect of ROMIR’s interest was expressed in the question: “What sites have you visited most frequently over the past month?”.  Analyzing the answers, we came to the conclusion that over the year, user preferences have not changed.  Oscillations in one direction or another are within the limits of statistical error. <br><br>  “It is worth only paying attention, firstly, to the growing interest in websites of online stores every quarter, from 34% in the third quarter of last year to 39% in the second quarter of this year,” say experts at the research holding.  “And, secondly, there is a tendency of falling interest in programming and PC sites, which may be due to the penetration of the Internet into wider masses”. <br><br>  The youngest users more often than the sample as a whole, visit sites devoted to literature.  They are also interested in resources devoted to music, education, cinema and computer games.  Users of middle and older age groups (from 25 years) are more often on news portals and sites with business and financial information.  People from 35 to 44 years old are more interested in traveling and tourism, and respondents over 45 years old are interested in science and medicine. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4290/</a></p>
