    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  What if you need a message from management? </h1><br>  You can always send an SMS using your iPhone 5. It has an excellent, bright screen and the availability of wireless methods of communication.  As you understand, intercepting such communication methods is easier than ever, and this can greatly change your plans for the working day. <br><br>  In this regard, the good old RS232 (better known as a COM port) can use any of the simplest PBXs in the city.  This is especially convenient when any, even very old piece of iron supports it.  And a 53-button keypad will help you quickly type a message, on which (unlike the iphone 5) you can type blindly.  This is true if during the sending of a message a rocket accidentally hit your shelter.  Or a helicopter fell on you.  Or a flying saucer hovers over you, from which green little men are parachuting. <br><br>  In a word - Psion 5mx is your assistant in any unexpected situation from everyday life.  Here we are happy to give him a well-deserved score. <br><br><h1>  What if a big car with a tint drove up to your house? </h1><br>  As you understand, in such a situation you need to show yourself as a simple tourist, albeit with quirks, as soon as possible by deleting all data from the device. <br><br>  In iPhone 5, you will find a convenient iCloud cloud storage, in which you can save all your settings and data of blah blah blah. <br><br>  You seriously intend to use this garbage at a time when people in the form of rushing to you? <br><br>  Psion 5mx offers a truly convenient solution for such situations.  Just pull out the batteries.  And use the brain for long-term backup data. <br><br>  And here Psion 5mx leaves behind his opponent.  Score 2-0 <br><br><h1>  What if you plan to use the device as a weapon. </h1><br>  With an impressive weight of 350g, the psion seems to be a leader, but looking at its soft plastic edges, it becomes clear that you will rather lose weapons and devices than inflict at least some damage to the enemy. <br><br>  The thinnest and lightest iPhone in history has a completely new aluminum design, and durable Gorilla Glass.  Even with a weight of only 112 grams, the iphone in capable hands is able to arrange a local Mila Jovovich with a katana. <br><br>  This is really useful when no one should know about your presence in the country.  Therefore, we are happy to give the score of iphone 5, which left its competitor far behind.  2-1 <br><br><h1>  What if you need to fly a helicopter only by numbers of coordinates? </h1><br>  I can use the GPS receiver in the iPhone 5. Take advantage of the latest three-dimensional maps, and even fly to the place.  But for this I need a cash card, because at an altitude of 400 meters above the ground you will hardly find a wifi.  But even in this case, the iPhone 5 will show me where to fly. <br><br>  Well, c psion 5mx you should only hope for a compass in a helicopter. <br><br>  iPhone 5 is in this situation a clear leader.  Score 2-2 <br><br><h1>  What if you need to download secret documents? </h1><br>  New iTunes - this is entertainment in any scenario.  Your music collection, apps, podcasts and more.  All the most interesting - in the iTunes application.  To do this, you need very little PC computer with an Intel or AMD processor (1 GHz) and 512 MB of RAM. <br><br>  At the same time, the standard RS232 allows you to connect to any device at least wiring from domestic wires.  And the built-in compiler of the OPL language will also allow you to write a program for decrypting these documents. <br><br>  The winner's score, we no doubt give palm Psion 5mx, and with a score of 3-2, he wins in this battle. <br><br><h1>  Afterword. </h1><br>  As you can see, it's not a matter of megahertz, but in convenience, and here psion 5mx simply has no equal even among the most recent devices.  Of course, if you are in a computer game about a special agent :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157051/</a></p>
