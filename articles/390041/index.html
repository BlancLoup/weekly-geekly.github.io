After upgrading the system to iOS 9, their device unexpectedly reported an ‚Äúerror 53‚Äù, after which its further use was impossible. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/feb/05/error-53-apple-iphone-software-update-handset-worthless-third-party-repair">The Guadian reports</a> that the error appeared both among users who repaired their phones in workshops that are not Apple-licensed, and those who just slightly damaged the phone - but so that it was still working.

      After the appearance of the ill-fated error, the phone stops working;  all photos, contacts and other materials become inaccessible.  It is alleged that there is still no known way to return this phone to life. <br><br>  In his article in November 2015, technical specialist <a href="http://blog.icracked.com/blog/2015/11/24/error-53/">Ruben Esparza argues</a> that support staff do not know how to fix this error - there is no spare part that could be replaced or software that could be patched to access the phone‚Äôs memory. . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As it turned out as a result of stormy discussion of the topic on the Internet, the phone goes into deep nirvana after replacing or damaging the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button, in which the fingerprint scanner is embedded. <br><br>  One of the typical cases occurred at the military photojournalist Antonio Olmos, who during a business trip to the Balkans damaged his phone.  He urgently needed to repair the device - but since there are no official Apple services in Macedonia, he turned to the local craftsmen, who repaired the phone.  The device worked without problems - until Antonio confirmed the upgrade of the system.  After that, the device issued an error 53 and was silent forever. <br><br>  Another typical case <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7400931%3Ftstart%3D0">occurred with an Arjunthebuster user</a> who bought a phone in Dubai and dropped the device.  The screen cracked a little, but the smartphone remained functional and the owner did not turn to repair it.  When he installed the system update, he saw the same death bug. <br><br>  Technical experts, according to The Guadian, claim that Apple had all the necessary information about the possibility of such a problem after the system update, but did not do anything to warn its customers about possible problems with the phone. <br><br>  A company representative gave comments with explanations of what was happening.  According to her, the protection of personal data in the phone is carried out by creating a secure pair consisting of data storage and a fingerprint scanner.  If the phone as a result of the self-test determines that pairing security is compromised, it blocks access to the data store. <br><br>  Whether Apple is trying to oust small repair offices out of business (and it should be noted that, for example, in the UK the replacement of the scanner <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/support/iphone/repair/other/">will cost 236 pounds</a> ) really protects the safety of its customers, or simply the company‚Äôs employees have not fully considered the security system - this question remains open. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390041/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390041/</a></p>
