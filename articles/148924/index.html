  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LTE in the regions or we are also not lucky</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr√© already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144239/">appeared</a> posts about 4G Internet from Megaphone.  And they concerned, first of all, Moscow and Moscow region.  However, Moscow is not the only city where LTE network is launched.  In addition to the capital, 4G is available in Samara, Novosibirsk, Krasnodar, Sochi, Vladivostok, and finally, from this Monday, in my native Ufa.  Actually, the speed and availability of 4G in Ufa will be this post.  The picture for the seed is attached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8fa/b17/c5f/8fab17c5fa72a26d1ff30150d57c2ec7.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The above screenshot is the result of measuring the speed in the office of Megaphone.  Conditions are close to perfect, but the speed is still impressive.  When you connect a modem in the office and at work, the results are not so brilliant, but the download honestly keeps around 14-18 megabits, and the ping does not rise above 80 (the signal level is about 50%).  Also very good.  The picture below shows the worst measurement taken.  I would call it the minimum measured speed.

At the time of Wi-Max from Yota speed rarely rose above 2-3 megabits.  And since Megafon uses Yota stations (with updated equipment) as base stations, I consider the result to be quite successful.  At least, the speed and comfort of surfing is comparable to the sensations of the wired channel. <br><br>  Now, as to the equipment.  Pro modem pretty well written <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144239/">here</a> .  I have the same copy, only without these huge 4G on board.  From myself I want to add that the modem is uncomfortable to be big.  If you plug it into the USB port of a laptop, it happily blocks the neighboring ports.  This looks something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/166/074/98f/16607498ffadbb55bfa492ed04ae27f2.jpg"><br><br>  On this netbook, he blocked the video output and audio port.  On my working machine, I ‚Äúeaten away‚Äù the neighboring USB.  Considering that USB on a laptop is always lacking, it was somewhat sad. <br><br>  There are some glitches in the software.  Example: I work for two monitors: a regular notebook and a large attachable one.  Windows by default considers that the main monitor should be the left monitor, and the right monitor should be attached.  My monitors are located the other way around (configured by dragging monitors in the ‚Äúscreen settings‚Äù section).  The problem is that the program "Megaphone modem" every time you start it is persistently displayed on the "left attached monitor."  Those.  if you make the location of monitors standard from the point of view of Windows, ‚ÄúMegaphone modem‚Äù will appear.  If the location is different - the window is drawn somewhere else.  As a result, when you first start you have to change the location of the monitors, pull out the modem window to the main monitor, then re-arrange the location.  In general, a few annoying. <br><br>  These were cons.  And now the pros.  As already said, the modem is pretty fast.  Unlike the LTE-modem Yota, which is slightly smaller in size, it catches not only 4G, but also 3G, 2G, etc.  This makes the modem universal and allows you to use not only in the city (in the megaphone itself, it is unofficially called an ‚Äúall-terrain vehicle‚Äù).  The modem has a socket for two antennas.  I have not tried them, but there is hope for a signal gain outside the city.  So, with certain reservations, I am satisfied with the modem. <br><br>  Now about the prices.  There is a modem in our Palestine almost 3,000 rubles.  At the same time, if you order a modem from the site of the megaphone itself, it will cost a thousand less.  Those.  for 1990 rubles.  As for traffic prices, the local branch of MegaFon has not yet decided on tariffs.  August-September traffic will be free.  During this time, Megafon will decide on tariffs and roll out tariff plans.  Probably they will be similar to the rates from Yota.  <b>UPD meanwhile (sort of like) a limit of 25GB per month is applied, after which the speed is cut .:</b> <br><br>  In general, if you sum up and talk about feelings, they are the most pleasant.  It feels like a small revolution is taking place before your eyes.  It remains to wait for normal routers, tablets and phones that support the new standard.  And here it is - a small personal happiness. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148924/</a></p>
