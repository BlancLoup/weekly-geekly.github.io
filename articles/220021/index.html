Changes in the information technology sector are setting new technologies and practices for virtually all sectors of the economy. <br>  In the field of IT are several important processes.  First of all, the world is becoming more and more connected due to telecommunication solutions, the volume of data increases, solutions for their processing are developing.  Secondly, the trend is developing for ever greater mobility and more and more ‚Äúuser-friendly‚Äù to the user.  Thirdly, such new environments as virtual worlds are being developed for a variety of purposes, including those created on the basis of augmented reality technologies.  Nevertheless, the development and production of hardware, software and security systems remain priorities within the IT sector.

      <i>Professions that will appear until 2020</i> <br>  <b>Interface Designer.</b>  It is engaged in the development and creation of user-friendly, adaptable interfaces for equipment, equipment, and software of various levels.  He has good usability competence. <br>  In general, this is not news at all; today, on this request, Headhunter offers over 50 vacancies.  Obviously, there will only be more further. <br><br>  <b>Network lawyer.</b>  Specialist engaged in the formation of regulatory and legal interaction on the Web (including in virtual worlds), developing systems of legal protection of a person and property on the Internet (including virtual property). <br>  Taking into account the fact that an increasing amount of various operations is being transferred to the network, legislation will develop greatly, which will require serious development of services in this area, and therefore also specialists in ‚Äúnetwork law‚Äù, as there are housing lawyers today, for example. <br><br>  <b>Organizer of online communities.</b>  Specialist in the organization and moderation of electronic forums, gaming and educational sites on the web. <br>  An important element of the future will be numerous electronic media for education, entertainment and other communications.  Of course, such sites, in order for them to communicate productively, will require a serious staff of moderators - not those with a plus meter, but holders of the meanings of dialogues and able to control them and direct the course of discussions, as now the moderators of ‚Äúlive‚Äù events do. <br><br>  <b>IT preacher.</b>  Specialist in communication with end-users of IT products, promotion of new solutions to groups conservatively tuned to advanced technologies, providing training for people to new programs and services to reduce the digital divide among the population. <br>  A profession that will appeal to the majority, I am sure.  However, if you leave a joke - such a specialist solves a very important task.  Technology is changing with great speed and the ‚Äúdigital divide‚Äù between generations and various groups of people is increasing.  Schoolchildren today often do not know computer technology better than their teachers.  This undermines the credibility of the teacher, which affects the perception of education.  Similarly, in almost any job - surely, you need people who can help conservative employees in mastering changing products. <br><br>  <b>Digital linguist.</b>  A professional who develops linguistic systems for semantic translation (translation taking into account context and meaning), processing textual information (including semantic search on the Internet) and new communication interfaces between humans and computers in natural languages. <br>  In early April, ABBYY <a href="http://www.abbyy.ru/Default.aspx%3FDN%3D2d53227a-1105-4e71-b1f8-a68d1664a4ef">announced</a> the appearance of the first solutions based on Compreno - in fact, a semantic translation system.  Read more about this in a <a href="http://d-russia.ru/v-rossii-sozdan-smyslovoj-processor.html">good article</a> .  In any case, it is clear that this trend will develop further, and linguists will be in demand.  In addition, there is a serious request for the simplification and disconnection of communication between a person and a computer - this also means a demand for such competencies. <br><br>  <b>Model developer big data.</b>  A specialist who designs systems for collecting and processing large amounts of data obtained via the Internet, develops assembly interfaces and analytical models themselves. <br>  About big data today everything is also clear - one of the main trends of the last time.  And gradually big data becomes extremely big data.  So, we need architects and developers of such complex systems, as well as experts in creating analytics based on them. <br><br>  <i>Professions that will appear after 2020</i> <br>  <b>Information Systems Architect.</b>  Qualified specialist in a wide range of work with data processing systems.  In particular, it designs databases, develops algorithms of action, ensures effective access of users to data storages, controls the quality of data storage, logic of information storage and retrieval, etc. <br>  Of course, such experts are already today.  However, in connection with the already mentioned rapid growth of the penetration of information technologies in all spheres of life, it becomes clear that, firstly, such specialists will become more and more popular, and secondly, will become more and more focused on the solution of this particular problem. <br><br>  <b>Virtuality Architect</b>  Specialist in designing solutions that allow you to work, study and relax in virtual reality.  Develops software and equipment based on the user's bio and psycho parameters (including for individual order). <br>  <b>Designer of virtual worlds.</b>  Creates conceptual solutions for the virtual world: philosophy, laws of nature and society, rules of social interaction and economy, landscape, architecture, sensations (including smells and sounds), the living world and the social world. <br>  A vivid example here is <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> , the virtual world that is actively used at Harvard and Oxford, where thousands of stores are located and there are representative offices of large companies (for example, IBM).  In the future, such worlds will multiply and develop, which means that we will need both architects of such worlds and their designers. <br><br>  <b>Neural Interface Designer.</b>  Specialist in the development of interfaces compatible with the human nervous system for controlling computers, home and industrial robots, taking into account the psychology and physiology of users. <br>  Today, neural interfaces are in the entertainment zone - one of the most well-known examples is the Nekomimi neural cans that move on a person‚Äôs head, depending on the state of the person ‚Äî relaxed, agitated, etc.  Or the game Mindflex, where players must either hold the "power of thought" ball through the maze, or defeat an opponent. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/cAT9QGZ6wGw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg61VwP-m60YlKYQGh_rvq6K4KPiQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  However, in the future with the help of neural interfaces it will be possible to manage various complex devices, so that designers and developers of such interfaces will also be needed. <br><br><h4>  Robotics and engineering </h4><br>  Already, there is a growing interest in robotics, according to Cisco research, the number of home robots in cities doubles every 9 months, and in the future robots will be an absolutely familiar part of the interior.  In addition to domestic use, robots will be actively used in industry - as early as 2012, Philips launched an almost fully <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/business/new-wave-of-adept-robots-is-changing-global-industry.html%3Fpagewanted%3Dall%26_r%3D0">automated</a> razor blade <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/business/new-wave-of-adept-robots-is-changing-global-industry.html%3Fpagewanted%3Dall%26_r%3D0">factory</a> in the Netherlands, with barely a dozen people (Philips has several hundred employees in a similar factory in China). <br>  It is impossible not to mention such incidents as a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/01/30/theres-a-giant-robot-directing-traffic-in-congo/">robot-policeman who controls traffic in the Congo</a> .  It seems to be funny, but it reflects the trends well. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d82/ae9/558/d82ae95585d5549656d480cbaf917654.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Professions that will appear until 2020</i> <br>  <b>Industrial Robotics Designer.</b>  Specialist engaged in the design of robotic production devices (for operations such as painting, welding, packaging, stamping), production logistics devices, such as loaders, conveyors, manipulators, as well as robotic systems from such devices, for example, automated factories. <br>  Robotic production also comes to Russia: a few days ago a <a href="http://donnews.ru/V-Rostovskoy-oblasti-otkryli-pervyy-polnostyu-avtomatizirovannyy-lakokrasochnyy-zavod_15000">paint factory was opened in the Rostov region</a> , where 50 people work, and whose capacity is about 30 thousand tons of products per year, various automated lines appear.  This inevitably means that the designers of both such complexes and the designers of the robots themselves will be required for production requests. <br><br>  <b>The operator of multifunctional robotic systems.</b>  Specialist in the management and maintenance of robotic systems in complex and hazardous industries and when working with hard-to-reach or micro-objects. <br>  It seems to me that the creators of the Atlas in vain narrowed the profession to dangerous and complex industries, because even today the new specialists who are not needed before are already in demand even in the not the most dangerous industries.  So, for example, the general director of the Chebarkul Dairy Factory, which in April announced the <a href="http://up74.ru/novosti/2014/04-aprel/chebarkulskij-molochnyj-zavod-perekhodit-na-avtomatizirovannoe-proizvodstvo/">transition to automated production</a> , says: ‚ÄúThe change in terms of the number of employees is still expected - we now have a lot of manual labor, and in the case of automated production, we need people who will serve equipment.  We will additionally accept people and retrain our employees. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Designer ergonomist.</b>  Specialist designing robotized systems taking into account the ergonomic requirements of users, based on their physical and mental characteristics. <br>  Ergonomists, of course, not for the first year, but you need to understand that changes in technology have a very strong influence on the workplace, which, accordingly, leads to a change in their ergonomics. <br><br>  <b>Designer child robotics.</b>  Specialist who develops children's toys, games, gadgets and various mechanized consumer goods based on programmable robots, taking into account the physiological characteristics of children of different ages. <br>  Children love to play with robots, and the game is the best way to interest the child.  In principle, already today there are such projects, say, in Armenia a training designer system for children has been developed, which allows the construction of real robots in almost the same way that children now construct from Lego. <br><br>  <b>Robots Neurointerface Designer.</b>  A specialist designing control systems for industrial and combat robots through neural interfaces by individual operators and distributed teams. <br>  It is not very clear why this profession is separated from the designer of neural interfaces - in essence, simply the narrowing of the task.  It is also unclear why this profession will appear in robotics until 2020, and later in IT. <br><br>  <i>Professions that will appear after 2020</i> <br>  <b>Home Robots Designer.</b>  Specialist engaged in the development and programming of home robots (for example, a nurse nurse, cleaning robot, robot laundress, gardener robot, dog walking robot, etc.) that facilitate housekeeping.  Such robots are integrated with other elements of the smart home, they have freedom of movement and can perform complex homework. <br>  So far, the variety of home robots is not too large: English-speaking Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_robot">mentions</a> vacuum cleaners that are already familiar to us, <a href="http://eprst2000.livejournal.com/147095.html">robotic cat trays</a> , security robots, lawn mowers, window cleaners and pool cleaners.  Nevertheless, the vector is clear and in the future the number of robots will increase, it is possible that robots will finally be created that are able to find lost socks at home. <br><br>  <b>Designer medical robots.</b>  Specialist in the design of biocompatible robotic systems and cyber-devices for medicine and the biotechnology industry (for example, robotic surgeons, diagnostic robots, cyber-prostheses, etc.) <br>  Today there are quite a lot of tasks solved by medical robots, but it is clear that their number will increase: the desire to conduct minimally invasive operations and an increase in the accuracy of robotics also speak for this. <br><br>  This publication is the fifth of the new professions devoted to the analysis of the Atlas.  Other posts can be read here: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214101/">Biotechnologies and medicine</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215347/">power grids and power consumption</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/216567/">transport</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/218505/">nanotechnologies, space, ecology</a> . <br>  After the first two publications, I was contacted by Pavel Luksha, the lead developer of Atlas, and suggested collecting meaningful comments on the professions to supplement the Atlas with them when his version 2.0 is being prepared - it‚Äôs already obvious that there are both overlooked professions and unnecessary ones.  So if there is something to improve - let's try to improve.  Another important note from the authors of the Atlas regarding what these ‚Äúprofessions‚Äù are proposed in the Atlas: ‚ÄúWe understand by the new profession the‚Äú bundle ‚Äùof new competencies that are needed to solve the emerging new work tasks.  New work tasks are connected with the fact that technologies, work rules in the industry, etc. are changing. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.skolkovo.ru/public/media/documents/research/sedec/SKOLKOVO_SEDeC_Atlas.pdf">Link to the full version of Atlas</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220021/</a></p>
