In many cities where there are our offices, training centers have opened.  They teach students who want to work with us.  The largest Russian training center Eram is located in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  Why does the company teach students how the training is organized and which areas are the most popular, said <b>Zaal Lyanov</b> , head of the St. Petersburg training center Eram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/077/cbe/18e/077cbe18eb3b4304b6b00aca5a6e664e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why are students trained at EPAM? </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ac3/720/323/ac37203233f54fe695dcc60c789d3259.png" alt="image" align="left">  Many wonder why EPAM is so actively invested in student learning, rather than taking junior cards from the market.  There are reasons for this.

      Each company has its own approach to how to build work processes.  Often, a person who has already worked somewhere has his own ideas that are good or bad, and they may not coincide with ours.  For example, some people do not like to work on the principle of Agile, while at EPAM this approach is actively used: this is the specificity of working with our customers.  To work effectively, we advise you to adhere to certain principles.  But retraining people who have already formed a habit, it is very difficult. <br><br>  At the same time, if we take a person without experience, it is important for us to know that he has certain skills, and it is not just about programming.  You need to be able to work in a team, plan your time, confidently speak English to communicate with the customer, understand how the company is organized and how the internal systems work.  All this knowledge is given in the training center. <br><br><h3>  What is taught </h3><br>  We conduct courses in areas that are now most in demand in production.  These are <a href="http://epa.ms/COREJAVA">trainings</a> and <a href="http://epa.ms/ADVANCEDJAVA">internships externally</a> on Java, trainings for <a href="http://epa.ms/CoreTestAutomation">beginners</a> and <a href="http://epa.ms/AdvancedTestAutomation">continuing</a> on Test Automation, trainings on <a href="http://epa.ms/CoreNET">.NET</a> , <a href="http://epa.ms/JSTraining">JavaScript</a> , trainings on DevOps <a href="http://epa.ms/DevOpsStudents">for students</a> and <a href="http://epa.ms/DevOpsTraining">not only</a> , as well as <a href="https://training.by/Registration/Registration/1512">"Fundamentals of Unity game development"</a> . <br><br>  Java training is the most popular: it is a base that allows you to develop in different directions, for example, in test automation or Big Data. <br><br>  Most recently, we have opened new directions - <a href="https://epa.ms/iOSTraining">development for iOS</a> and <a href="https://www.training.ru/Registration/Registration/1581">UI / UX Design</a> .  This dictates the needs of the market and customers: you need more good specialists in these areas. <br><br><h3>  How to get to the training center </h3><br>  You need to select the appropriate training on the <a href="https://www.training.ru/">site</a> , get acquainted with the requirements and apply.  We take students from 3 courses, mostly - technical specialties.  We had the experience of training people in the humanitarian professions who simply came and said: ‚ÄúI want to become a programmer.‚Äù  This is possible, but more difficult than to prepare a graduate of a technical college.  Many curse universities, but still they give a good base.  If there is none, the time and effort that needs to be spent on training increases significantly.  In a short time to give everything that is included in Computer Science, we can not. <br><br>  The first stage of selection is a telephone interview.  After that, the student is invited to an in-person interview with a recruiter.  There, among other things, check the knowledge of English.  Then the student goes for an interview with a technician who works in production.  It lasts 40 minutes. They ask questions about programming and give tasks. <br><br>  English level must be at least A2 - Pre-Intermediate.  Even if a student perfectly answers programming questions, but does not know English, we do not take it, but we say: "Go and learn. Come back."  Good English is important to us: developers need to be able to communicate with foreign customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4da/309/2e6/4da3092e6ebd470184beffda9edcc293.jpg"><br><br><h3>  How is the training organized? </h3><br>  Preparation before going into production takes 6-9 months for most students.  Those who already have good knowledge, can immediately get on an internship internship - in the laboratory (Advanced courses) - and go into production faster, in about two months. <br><br>  A full course of study consists of several parts. <br><br>  <b>1. Evening courses</b> <br><br>  They last from 2 to 3 months and are held at the offices of EPAM.  Students come to us 2-3 times a week for 3-4-hour classes: these are lectures, practical tasks, checklists.  Course duration - 80-100 academic hours. <br><br>  Teachers, as a rule, are EPAM employees, senior level specialists and above.  They give lectures, check assignments, answer students' questions.  We do not say exactly how it is necessary to conduct lectures, each has its own approach: some prefer to give theory and homework, someone - live coding, someone combines both.  In addition, for each course there is a basic set of material that must be given to students. <br><br>  <b>2. Exam</b> <br><br>  When the course of lectures ends, you need to pass the exam.  There is a theoretical part - tickets with questions on major topics, there is a practical one - problem solving and something like a technical interview.  With the help of tasks, we check whether the student knows the algorithms, can write code.  There are tasks where we require a solution, what is called, to the last comma.  They are very simple, but it is important to make sure that the person has enough practice, and, having got on the real project, he will write the code without errors. <br><br>  <b>3. Laboratory</b> <br><br>  Having handed over the theory and having solved the problems, the students enter the laboratory.  Education here lasts an average of 4 months.  In the laboratory it is more intense than in the evening courses - more than 200 hours. <br>  First of all, students take a course in Agile, after which work begins in teams of 4-6 people.  Children participate in educational, research and open-source projects. <br><br>  We have a division of Life Sciences in St. Petersburg, where, among other things, we deal with bioinformatics.  AstraZeneca (a large pharmaceutical company that also produces cancer drugs) and the Broad Institute have several open source solutions, and our students get experience when they donate to them. <br><br>  Students also work on the internal projects of EPAM.  For example, they improve the systems with which they test their knowledge while studying in a training center.  By the end of the training, the tasks become more complex, they are often connected with real ‚Äúcombat‚Äù projects. <br><br>  The laboratory actively learns English: 1.5 hours 4 times a week.  It is very important to gain knowledge before entering production, where there is much less time to study.  If they came to us with the A2 level, they will grow to B1, and this is already enough to work with a foreign customer. <br><br>  <b>4. Entry into production</b> <br><br>  Those who passed the exam well, showed themselves in teamwork, took part in internal projects, remain to work at Eram.  We have no restrictions on the number: we take not the "top 10", and all those who suit us.  In most cases, we sign an employment contract during the first two months of an internship at the laboratory. <br><br>  All young specialists come to us through the training center: someone from the third year, someone later.  It is important to combine study with practice, and I advise everyone from the very beginning of their studies, from the first course, to participate in extracurricular activities and gain experience. <br><br>  Now we are continuing to recruit in several directions.  Go to the <a href="https://www.training.ru/">site</a> , choose the appropriate training and come to us to learn and get experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336750/</a></p>
