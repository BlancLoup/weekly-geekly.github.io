For the quarter.  Madness. <br><br>  How crazy is that?

And this has touched in order to set a record earnings for the whole year. <br><br>  Over the last quarter, Apple surpassed ExxonMobil in 2008, Royal Dutch Shell in 2008 and Gazprom 2011 and became the company that earned the most in a quarter in the history of business.  All of these companies are engaged in oil and gas, and these profits were made before the fall in oil prices.  So it's time for Gazprom to start selling smartphones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Apple has not gone bankrupt, iPod is not a silly idea, the Apple Store has earned, the iPhone has not fallen into oblivion.  And without Steve Jobs, the company managed.  And Tim Cook did not have to be fired.  Apple has no competitors in the global business.

      Apple now has the best problem in the world - having overtaken the best businesses in the whole history, they have no place to strive for, no place to look for gold.  Or oil. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúA whole ocean of oil is under our feet, and only I can get it!‚Äù - Daniel Plainview, ‚ÄúOil.‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  It always seemed to me that the iPhone is such a good business for Apple (not only <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/16997124721/size-matters">more than the entire Microsoft company</a> , but maybe more than any other business) that it is almost impossible to make it grow further.  Apple bypassed the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawoflargenumbers.asp">law of big numbers</a> and the business continues to grow.  And he still has where to go, especially in places like China.  But what about other products? <br><br>  The iPad, although a successful product, doesn‚Äôt compare with the iPhone.  Apple Watch is likely waiting for the same fate.  Television experiments?  It may bring a couple of billions, but they can not be compared with the iPhone. <br><br>  In this regard, the question is - where does Apple go next?  I used to joke that they would have to become an oil company, but now it‚Äôs not funny anymore.  Maybe <a href="https://twitter.com/jiaaro/status/560252663963475969">make cars</a> ?  Or become a bank?  Apple Pay is the first step to this.  But so far, the business is mainly engaged in iPhones. <br><br>  In 2015, Apple Pay may not take off, but in 2016 it is possible.  An iPhone someday, like all businesses.  But Apple, using the example of iPod, proved that they can use the current success to fuel the search for the next.  The iPhone has given them for at least ten years. <br><br>  But then again, the bar is raised too high.  What business can be more than an iPhone?  It is impossible to imagine, it does not exist.  These are not cars, not a bank, not oil.  It has yet to be invented. <br><br>  Or perhaps it exists, but the market is just waiting for its catalyst, which was the iPhone for smartphones.  It is interesting to imagine what it could be.  But you can't know for sure.  Even Apple had no idea how big the iPhone would be.  The biggest in the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285890/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285890/</a></p>
