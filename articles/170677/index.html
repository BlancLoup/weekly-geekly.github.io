  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What we learned in 30 hours of coding on SAP InnoJam</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you are a geek, then most likely you have heard of SAP InnoJam.  SAP InnoJam for geeks is like Iron Man competition for athletes.  And the meeting that took place last November in Madrid was no exception.  The event brought together developers from SAP, their partners and IT experts to find out who can best develop a software solution in just 30 hours. <br><br>  A total of 62 people from 14 countries, divided into 8 teams.  The specific theme of the development was kept secret before the start of the competition, the participants only knew that urban technologies were chosen as the general direction.  Teams were asked to find the best solutions to improve the quality of urban life.  During the competition, teams were given 30 hours to develop ready-made solutions, and the specific topic sounded like ‚ÄúThe better the city, the better it is to live‚Äù (‚ÄúBetter Cities - Better Lives‚Äù). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first team to complete the task was ‚ÄúPARK'O'VATION‚Äù with their solution to the parking problem.  The system allowed the drivers to set the parameters of interest (parking cost, distance, etc.), and to obtain the optimum, according to the entered data, parking space within a particular city. <br><br>  Team 2 of WeCare focused on helping people in the neighborhood.  The software solution showed which of your neighbors needed help at the moment.

      The third team, Otter Inc., presented a development that allowed to assess the current situation with local transport and gave recommendations on choosing a route based on user preferences, fare, destination and critical travel time. <br><br>  The fourth team, Smurney, created a similar product for choosing the optimal route, with the difference that their application also contained safety and environmental criteria for the route. <br><br>  The fifth team was Family Matters with their development of a social network in miniature for people living next door, with the ability to broadcast various messages within a certain group. <br><br>  The sixth team "Park-IT" has developed an application that displays all the parking lots of the city, with the ability to filter by distance, convenience and available services. <br><br>  Team number 7 were ‚Äúe-kids‚Äù who presented the parent ‚Äúcontrol panel‚Äù.  The meaning of the application was to monitor what children learn at school and what events are planned there. <br><br>  The last presentation was from the AGA Pulico team.  Their system allowed to vote on the issues on the agenda in their city government.  Users of the system have the opportunity to vote for and against, leave comments, and also see which of the closest neighbors has a particular position. <br><br>  <i>Soloten employees really enjoyed participating in such a competition in different teams.</i>  <i>We will definitely use ‚Äústress-coding‚Äù approaches in cases where the project requires the immediate issuance of a prototype, when there is no opportunity to think and build up, when you only need to distribute the roles, sit down and execute the project.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  The most interesting projects were presented by the teams ‚ÄúWeCare‚Äù and ‚ÄúPark-IT‚Äù, which were named the winners.  The WeCare team solution was a mobile application with a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù part managing the entire ecosystem of the neighborhood.  Neighbors could help each other in various everyday problems (start a car, make collective purchases, sit with a child, etc.), as well as discuss local events and events.  The Park-IT team demonstrated its winning mobile application Parking Shark, optimized for the Windows 8 tablet interface. The application helped to find the parking according to the criteria set by the user.  The following evening, the winning teams presented their applications in the face of thousands of geeks at another equally interesting event - SAP DemoJam. <br><br>  It was an amazing experience with people who had never seen each other before, but at the same time could get together, combine ideas and efforts, and show workable software that 30 hours ago did not even exist! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170677/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170677/</a></p>
