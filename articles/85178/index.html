  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Our programmable brain. Part two</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, we conditionally divided the entire process of human evolution into 8 stages, which, in turn, in the course of their own individual development, passes every reasonable primacy.  This separation may seem strained, but it is a convenient <i>model</i> and nothing more.  Evolution is not so simple and quick to be described in 3-5 points, and I think that not all readers will be interested in a more detailed division) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The four circuits described <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/popular_science/85053/">earlier</a> corresponded to our development until today, at the request of the readers in some detail about each of them: <br><ul><li>  <b>Oral bio-survival circuit</b> - the consciousness of amphibians, an instant reaction to the events around.  This circuit is triggered by the danger of our survival, it does not have a time delay, it acts at the lowest and most primitive level.  Put your hand in the fire - the muscles contract without conscious participation.  A policeman pulls a pistol from a robber and then cannot remember what happened - ‚Äúit was somehow by itself‚Äù.  Determines the choice of "either-or": go forward to protection, food, or step back from the threat of a predator. <br><br>  Programming at this stage denotes the subject of safety, food, and in an ordinary mammal it has a breast, a mother's nipple.  Therefore, there is a close relationship between oral and survival, pleasure.  Smoking, constant chewing, biting, and many other manifestations are a consequence of this program.  And the rounded shape of the chest affects almost everything created by people - the conquest of the conical mountain peaks, the domes of temples, arches, and graceful curved lines.  A great example is the instrument of oral satisfaction ‚Äî cutlery;  square plates and spoons seem ‚Äúa little strange‚Äù to us. <br><br>  In modern man, this most ancient structure is located in the brain stem and is closely connected with the endocrine and other most important systems of the body.  Violations in this circuit affect the whole organism as a whole, its ‚Äúphysical‚Äù component.  Now money is becoming the subject of bio-survival, replacing family, pack, tribe of previous eras.  It becomes clear the source of constant fear and neurosis, which is a modern man. </li><li>  <b>The anal emotional circuit</b> is younger than the first, located in the thalamus and is mainly associated with the muscles.  The first circuit is imprinted more often by the mother, then the second - by the father.  Depending on the conditions of the environment, the individual receives the role of a subordinate or alpha male.

      Intersecting with the measurement of the primary circuit, we can obtain a two-dimensional social equation: <br><img src="http://rghost.ru/1032069/image.png" alt="image"><br>  That same, known since antiquity, the division of characters. </li><li>  <b>Semantic contour</b> - contour allows you to make a "map of reality" and pass on to the next generation.  You can call this circuit ‚Äúmind‚Äù, when a person is called ‚Äúintelligent,‚Äù more often they have in mind the skills of his communication, ‚Äúthe language is well suspended‚Äù. <br>  The contour appeared not so long ago in humanity and therefore is under the influence of more ancient.  Very often, there is a confusion of concepts and a person who is threatened at the word level perceives this as a threat to the primary biovirass or to the social status of the second. <br>  When the heaviest imprint falls on this circuit, the person usually grows <a href="http://www.corvus.com.ua/glossariy/ektomorfniy">cerebrotonic</a> .  They are frightened by the playfulness of people of the first contour and the emotions of the second, ‚Äúcold mind‚Äù - this is their essence. </li><li>  <b>Moral socio-sexual contour</b> - determines the role in society.  Anarchist or citizen, sexual outcast or exemplary family man - all this is programmed at the time of vulnerability. </li></ul>  According to Leary‚Äôs theory, only half of the information encoded in the DNA has been used to date.  In the future, the second part will define and guide us.  If so, then we are in the middle of evolutionary development and the following is waiting for us: <br><ul><li>  <b>Neurosomatic contour</b> - contour is non-linear and global, it works with <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">gestalts</a> , but not sequential logical connections of semantics.  Associated with the cortex of the right hemisphere, the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">limbic system</a> (1 circuit) and the genitals.  From here follows one of the ways to launch the circuit - a long sexual game without an orgasm.  Yes, Indian Tantra, Chinese Dao, you are right). <br>  The activated neurosomatic circuit eliminates the problems of more ancient circuits - the ‚Äúphysical‚Äù pain of the first, the struggle for the status of the second, the excessive emotionality of the third, and the robotic rationality of the fourth. <br>  The brain begins to take all the signals of the environment, uses its full potential, eliminating the problems of "animal" circuits.  ‚ÄúAny action becomes an orgasm,‚Äù <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Crowley</a> wrote about this circuit. <br>  As part of evolutionary development, the circuit prepares a person for weightlessness.  Controlling your body, your body as a unit, is going out into space.  Living at the bottom of a gravity well, there is no point in hoping for a jump in development. <br>  The contour itself does not turn on and requires special practices, programming has not yet begun). </li><li>  <b>Collective neurogenetic contour</b> - the contour comes into effect when the nervous system is able to receive a signal from a separate neuron, from a dialogue of DNA-RNA.  Our organisms are created according to a program in the archives of DNA, access to them opens up precisely the neurogenetic contour. <br>  Theoretically, it is here that the collective unconscious is located together with the entire previous evolution of man, as well as archetypes and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2585%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">synchronicity</a> . <br>  The circuit itself does not turn on, requires long practice or funds. </li><li>  <b>Outline of metaprogramming</b> - Up to this point, we have become familiar with the methods and techniques of programming.  A certain time of vulnerability and the program is stored in our brain, defining actions, actions.  Gaining access to this contour, we can change the introduced programs. <br>  We step aside and see the contours that govern us, moreover, we are these contours.  But this model is again inside the consciousness, inside the contours.  ‚ÄúWe are confronted with infinity where we least expected her to meet ‚Äî in our own lonely selves. <br>  If we represent consciousness as a way of perception, building a reality, then the contour makes it possible to change reality.  Fantasy, is not it?) </li><li>  <b>Nonlocal Quantum Circuit</b> - If we view our brain as a computer, then the whole universe will be a metacomputer.  Its program component is one for all.  Non-local information system giving access to everything, absolutely everything.  But here the realm of guesswork and fantasy begins, our mind refuses to understand and model such things. </li></ul><br>  You are interested in something, caused confusion, interest - specify in the comments. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/popular_science/85460/">Continued here.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85178/</a></p>
