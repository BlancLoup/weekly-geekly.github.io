  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pro 112, and how it works now</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Without waiting for the anniversary of almost the only post about the service 112 from 2009 ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/66963/">here</a> ), I want to update the information on this nice service for me.  I described the current state of the service in Voronezh under the cut, but we can assume that during the year, the system-112 will fit this description in 80% of the subjects of the Russian Federation.  And for those who are not interested in reading, I will say briefly: ‚ÄúIn any incomprehensible situation, call 112!‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  112 - federal project </h4><br>  Phone 112 works everywhere, this is a federal project, but the structures of the subject (oblast) and the municipality (local) are responsible for handling calls.  So, depending on the quickness of the local authorities, there will be different answers in different areas.  Someone has a clever information system, and someone, sorry, a night watchman.  By the end of 2018, information systems and centralized call management should be implemented in all regions of the Russian Federation.  The Ministry of Emergency Situations, as a responsible federal agency, regularly has enemas on this subject. <br><br><h4>  Organizational structure </h4><br>  In fact, i.e.  by their troubleshooting actions, municipal services respond to calls.  Each municipality has a single dispatcher service (EDDS), it has contacts with the fire service, police, ambulance, utilities, gas workers and other emergency services (EOS) of the city or region.  It is in the EDDS that the call 112 comes in, carefully forwarded by the telecom operator, depending on the territory in which the tower receives the signal. <br><br>  The regional authorities organize the CEC, which unites all this into the system, adding cherries in the form of translators, a psychologist, foresters and some other extravagant services.  CC also serves the general equipment, provides methodological guidance, picks up the calls missed by the municipalities.

      Each operator-112 can connect with each, remaining on the line or disconnecting.  In the interaction rules, they describe which services to connect in one way or another.  For example, in case of an accident, besides the traffic police, the police and the ambulance are needed if there are injured people, and the rescuers need to be caught and firemen need to spill fuel.  Last week, a beaver bit a woman, called someone you need.  The main thing is that the results of the survey of the victim are visible to all the services involved.  We often have the police and the ambulance do not communicate with the applicant at all, but write on the card that the call is accepted, the brigade is sent.  Well, the services have their own specifics: for example, if the ambulance of a given area does not respond for 20 seconds, then the call is redirected to the neighboring area defined for this by an order, and the car will leave from there. <br><br>  The regulation also describes which cases to respond to, and which to not.  For example, some subjects accept appeals on housing and communal services, and some do not (we accept).  But in almost any case, the operator-112 is easier to navigate the necessary actions than the subscriber. <br><br><h4>  Communication structure </h4><br>  The telecom operator routes your call to the 10-digit telephone number reserved for this territory (district, city) in a single regional communication center UOVEOS.  We have WECE in Rostelecom, but some of the TOVs are rumored to take this happiness upon themselves.  Next, the SIP call is transmitted to the server call center, where, by that same 10-digit number, it is determined in which EDDS the call should be routed.  In our case, the direction is already done by means of an information system, using a VPN network specially created for this, to the automated workplace of the EDDS operator.  The EDDS operator on the screen lights up the socket, he takes the call to the headset and, by querying the applicant, can connect other services via intercom or by calling to the public telephone network.  All connections - by clicking the mouse. <br><br>  The operator-112 can, by pressing a button, request from the carrier‚Äôs information system the location of the caller and additional information about him.  According to the 607th order of the ISS, this should be from May 1, 2017, but is actually being implemented only now.  We have until the end of 2017. The information is displayed in the call card and on the map in the geographic information system (for each operator, 112 has a separate monitor). <br><br>  The subscriber number is determined, the actions are logged, the sound is written.  Shelf life - 3 years. <br><br>  Communication reservation: <br><br><ul><li>  if there is no channel to the EDDS or it does not take a call for longer than 8 seconds, then the call will receive the call center for it; </li><li>  if there is no channel to the call center, then calls from the CEE E1 go to the EDDS IP phones; </li><li>  if neither one nor the other, then a regular telephone rings in EDDS. </li></ul><br>  There is integration with neighboring subjects: if the tower mistakenly routed a subscriber from the border area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Kursk region to Voronezh, then the 112 operator will contact the Kursk Call Center and will transfer the call there without breaking the connection. <br><br>  Calls from ERA-GLONASS are received daily.  Previously, together with the coordinates, but now they are temporarily suspended, we finish the protocol.  Tested at the nearest motor show, and since then the demonstration of the action of the ERA-GLONASS instrument in the car being sold has become a mandatory feature for them. <br><br>  There is a connection with CCTV cameras "Safe Region" - the operator-112 from his workplace can watch the broadcast of the camera closest to the scene of the incident, and the operator of video surveillance can generate an automated creation of the incident for 112 based on the data from the camera. <br><br>  The needless ones come constantly - either in the form of IMEI, or with a substitution on the 10-digit number allocated by the carrier for such cases.  Often check phones when buying, often indulge in children and bored idiots.  But then somehow the peasant got into the well, where his telecom operator did not catch, so the tower of another operator picked him up and, as a nessless one, handed it to us.  Those.  the peasant could not call anywhere except at 112. Found in the end, turning on the siren on the car - he corrected the crew by the sound of "cold-hot". <br><br>  Induced "empty" calls - pain.  Dialing 112, in contrast to 911, is once generated by faulty equipment. <br><br><h4>  Statistics </h4><br>  On the million city about 2 thousand calls per day, plus the same on the area.  Of them: <br>  <i>First-45%</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Police - 30%</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Traffic police - 12%</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Fire Service - 6%</i> <br><br><h4>  Why is it all come up with? </h4><br><ul><li>  a person does not fool ‚Äúwhere to call?‚Äù, calls to 112, and there are specially trained operators; </li><li>  A call can be made without a SIM card, from a locked phone, outside the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour operator; </li><li>  built reservation system; </li><li>  effective response to ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù visits: all emergency services involved see the result of the survey and response, can participate in the survey; </li><li>  there is a single point of entry for related services: from ERA-GLONASS, from neighboring subjects, from video surveillance systems, from the ‚ÄúSafe Region‚Äù system. </li></ul><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  In any incomprehensible situation, call 112! <br><br>  Thanks to all! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340666/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340666/</a></p>
