  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Alphabet was created a year ago.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/96f/4c4/878/96f4c48789c939d2cf5a965959935466.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A year ago, Larry Page <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/260042/">announced</a> the creation of Alphabet Holding, the parent company of the existing Google business, which was reorganized into several divisions.  The largest of them continues to be a division focused on Internet development, and teams dedicated to biomedical development and unmanned vehicles received separate roles.  The name itself - Alphabet - implies that all subsidiaries of the holding will correspond to each letter of the alphabet - ‚ÄúG is for Google‚Äù, for example;  Accordingly, this idea was registered domains <a href="https://abc.xyz/">abc.xyz</a> and <a href="http://abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com/">abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com</a> .  A little later, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/263350/">it turned</a> out that Google no longer follows the ‚Äúdon't be evil‚Äù principle, but instead does the ‚Äúright things‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Two new key top managers </h3><br>  In general, the new holding feels good - the company's revenue is <a href="http://ru.investing.com/equities/google-inc-income-statement">growing</a> and at some point the cost of the assets of Alphabet <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/icover/blog/270416/">surpassed the</a> cost of Apple, but only a day.  Investors also show no excitement about the growing expenses of the company, and this is largely due to <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/business/431943">Ruth Porat</a> , Chief Financial Officer, who has the tacit status of ‚Äúthe most influential woman on Wall Street‚Äù and is associated with the restoration of Morgan Stanley after the 2008 financial crisis. <br><br>  Ruth Porat is made up of another influential Internet business woman, Diana Green, who is one of the founders of VMWare.  Diana is now the senior vice president of Google and runs the company's entire cloud business, including Google for Work, Google Cloud Platform and Google Apps.  Most of all, she is known for her work at Silicon Graphics Inc, Tandem Computers Inc, Sybase Inc, as well as generous spending on charity.  Both women - Ruth Porat and Diana Green - went to work at Alphabet just at the stage of transforming Google into a new holding.

    <h3>  There are losses </h3><br>  Chris Urmson, Google Unmanned Car CTO division, <a href="https://medium.com/%40chris_urmson/the-view-from-the-front-seat-of-the-google-self-driving-car-a-new-chapter-7060e89cb65f">announced a</a> few days ago that he was leaving the company after 7 years of work in it.  Chris did not specify a specific reason for leaving, spoke very warmly about Google and hinted that he would like to take part in a new and interesting project.  A little earlier, two key engineers specializing in machine vision left Dave Fergusson and Jiajun Zhu.  According to unconfirmed <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/technology/alphabet-google-autonomous-car-chris-urmson.html%3F_r%3D0">rumors</a> , they will be engaged in their own project. <br><br><h3>  Technical projects </h3><br><ul><li>  About a year ago, all kinds of technoblogs and media actively covered the news of the <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2BProjectLoon">Project Loon</a> project, during which it was supposed to distribute the Internet from balloons in the stratosphere.  Over the past year, the mention of this project has become much less. </li><li>  The company Boston Dynamics, owned by the search giant, according to actively circulating <a href="http://www.techinsider.io/toyota-in-talks-to-acquire-boston-dynamics-from-google-2016-5">rumors</a> , will be sold to the Japanese car manufacturer Toyota.  True, apparently, the deal has not yet taken place. </li><li>  A curious initiative has appeared in the holding‚Äôs assets: the company is going to make the wireless connection as fast as via cable - Google Fiber will <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/7/28/12318748/alphabet-google-fiber-wireless">take</a> care of this. </li><li>  Brand new division Daydream will compete with Facebook and other players in the field of virtual reality.  The Cardboard Cardboard Helmet is already well known, and more recently, engineers <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2016/08/daydream-labs-positive-social.html">announced</a> the development of methods to protect users from unwanted interactions in virtual reality. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369571/</a></p>
