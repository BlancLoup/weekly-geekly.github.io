  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is the hoster responsible for those whom he tamed?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I read forums all day long discussing the hot topic of the last days: ‚Äú3FN Blackout‚Äù.  The same topic ran through <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/61324/">the pages of</a> habrasoobschestva. <br><br>  This problem touched me most directly - dozens of sites (mine and partner) are unavailable, the mail does not work, materials created since the last external backup are lost, penalties for advertising are lost, prepaid money is lost and urgently need to be found for payment from another hosting provider plus time to move. <br><br>  Judging by the read materials, it seems that only those who did not have a 3FN account are happy with such a development.  It is more like a mixture of positions ‚Äúmy hut is on the edge‚Äù and ‚Äúlet the neighbor‚Äôs cow die.‚Äù  How ugly, eh?  But you, clever fellow citizens, are sure that only spammers, virus writers and pedophiles ‚Äúlived‚Äù on 3FN?  Have you ever thought that of more than 15,000 clients, most of them carried out quite legal activities and posted content that complied with US and international law?  I, and many of my partners, have chosen this host for fast servers and competent support.  After the Ukrainian and Russian hosters, on 3FN my sites just flew.  For more than a year of placement - 15 minutes of one-time idle time associated with the fall of the hard disk, accompanied by a polite apology of support in ICQ. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before you say "a right thing," think about what kind of precedent it creates.  If the American Federal Trade Tent will get away with such tricks, this can be considered the beginning of the end of the free network.  This is what turns out, now the feds can afford to cover up any data center, in whose territory the ‚Äúillegitimate content‚Äù is ‚Äúlit up‚Äù?  And if we consider that the bulk of serious data centers and providers are somehow connected with the United States, then soon they will block oxygen three times a day after eating?

      Before saying "now there will be less spam and viruses," I advise you to read spam, hacker and SEO forums.  The people earning hundreds of dollars a day use networks from backup servers in different data centers of the world and resumed their activity after a few hours (those who stopped at all).  In the first place suffered so-called.  ‚ÄúMere mortals‚Äù are owners of small projects on Shared or VPS hosting, in whose budget hosting is one of the main items of expenditure.  It is this category of customers who are now randomly looking for where and for what means to move, and also looks with horror at the dates of the last backups and estimates the size of penalties to advertisers. <br><br>  How many startups so loved by the habrasoobshchestvom could knock off the shutdown for a few days and move with partial data loss, I even difficult to guess.  After all, not by hearsay, I know how to do this project all day and night with a minimum break for sleep, and then, a month after the backup, which was postponed all the time.  all the time it took to patching holes and screwing up features, to listen to excuses from the host like ‚Äúwe made a backup on the same screw where the system was and it died all at once‚Äù. <br><br>  Today I paid for the new hosting, and in anticipation of its activation, I deploy back-ups on the backup server all day, try to get at least something from Google Cache and by phone I try to explain to the clients what I have to do with spammers and why the site (theirs) suddenly work. <br><br>  And now let's think together whether we are insured against what we can close for a website or a data center.  After all, in any forum, any visitor can insert a banned image, or a link to a porn site or a portal.  What will we do then, if the relevant authorities notice this before the moderators?  Or how to prove that you are not a camel if your newsletter to customers of any of the free mail services will consider SPAM?  Or how to explain to search engines that the page with links to partner sites is not a search spam?  And if I express my personal opinion about an organization on my personal blog or post a link to the works of a friend of DJ, how can I explain that I have not infringed anyone's rights? <br><br>  Doesn't it seem to you that the vaunted ‚Äúpresumption of innocence‚Äù automatically turns into a ‚Äúguilt assumption‚Äù on the sole reason that the source is owned by a person from ‚Äúspecial attention‚Äù countries?  Doesn't it seem to you that now any Western hoster, who is liberal in relation to people from the countries of the former USSR or himself having Slavic roots, now automatically goes along the razor's edge?  Maybe this is another witch hunt, where the easiest way to shift the blame on someone who is difficult to defend?  Or is it just a custom action to loudly displace a strong competitor from the market during a crisis and idle capacity at many hosters?  Give me a datacenter, on whose servers I have never run illegal content and I will tell you that you are lying. <br><br>  Question on filling: why are sanctions applied to the hoster and not to the owners of illegal resources? <br>  My answer is this: it is the national policy of the United States to fire sparrows from a cannon.  Do not like grouping goons?  Declare war on their country!  Don't like spammers?  Bombing hoster!  Do not find parallels? <br><br>  <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/06/ftc_sues_shuts_down_n_calif_we.html">The Washington Post</a> compares webmasters, who are struggling to recover their resources, with rats running from a ship.  As a representative of the "independent press" of the "most democratic state" can afford to speak in such a tone?  If they continue to operate with such methods, then most of the sites that are not related to US government or commercial structures will permanently move to Europe, from which the ‚Äúmegadier‚Äù will lose more than it was going to save. <br><br>  I think that trampling a serious hoster was a logical step after the process of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3DTPB">TPB</a> to show that the legal machine is ready to move anyone pointed to by the finger of the financial center. <br><br>  The article leaves more questions than answers, and this is a good reason to think about whether all the questions asked above can be considered rhetorical. <br><br>  Written messy, for boiling.  I understand that the distinguished community may not appreciate this post.  I agree with the fact that this is not what you used to see in the sandbox.  But there is a great desire to convey my point of view to the audience, the reader of which I have been for a long time. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> For this post I received an invite to Habr, which turned out to be a pleasant surprise) <br>  Thank's 2 <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vlad2000plus/" class="user_link">vlad2000plus</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> Help with karma pliz, there is a desire to transfer to the "Hosting". <br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> Thanks for the karma, moved. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61908/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61908/</a></p>
