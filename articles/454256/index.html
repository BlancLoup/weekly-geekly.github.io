", - and then these are what I have described.

      It is curious, undoubtedly, to look at a resource from 2012 today and notice two things: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  The first is that approximately the same books will lie (and lie) today on pages with similar titles. </li><li>  The second is that, suddenly, it turns out, before writing good programs, you first need to write a bunch of bad, useless code.  You cannot first read Knut or Horstman and, after reading it, become a good developer if you have not been bad yet.  That won't work.  In the opposite direction, however, everything works quite well: you become a poor developer and, if you want to become a good one, you go to read recognized authors and understand that everything you wrote before is a bunch of useless (or insufficiently useful) files in a container on one leg. with a load of 20 requests per second, although your ‚Äútests‚Äù showed that your service should keep 500. Then you begin to understand, stick slowly into thinner than your own logic, rules for organizing the work of applications, you understand that ‚Äúparallel‚Äù and ‚Äúdepl  th "- no magic words to debug time after time their code and becoming in every sense more clever and understanding. </li></ol><br><h4>  What happens next? </h4><br>  It turns out that while you went for a beer, the whole world is already launching the asynchronous code of two hundred of its microservices in containers under a cuber and stores all its data in cassandra. <br><br>  Probably something worth it to learn about this.  And here it turns out that 80 percent of the information read in the year before last is no longer suitable, approximately, absolutely.  Today, or rather, yesterday you had to understand what containers are, orchestrators, how to work with aws, spring releases version 5, springboot - the second. <br><br>  Probably, the student who noted graduation yesterday, after 4 years of graduation from the university, is, to say the least, shocking. <br><br>  It is good if universities (not only Moscow and St. Petersburg) suddenly start teaching Kotlin, Scala, Python3, Java9, Spring, Rx ... but what if not?  - In most cases, the answer to my question is higher ‚Äî yes, they definitely don‚Äôt teach anything at the university. <br><br>  All because the university, as a platform for future personnel in companies, in its advantage does not prepare students for work somewhere other than its own department, our universities are a cartoon in which a person thought that he wanted a higher education (because the process obtaining, it seems, should give him knowledge for a successful start of a career), but, in fact, he really needed a good secondary special, high-quality ‚Äúprogrammer's education‚Äù, such as to encode a lot and not so much to work with matan + half- years to look  whether he wants to be in science or not. <br><br>  I sincerely sympathize with the students who once discovered that their knowledge was outdated before they entered the university. <br><br>  After 4 years in a heap of companies, an asynchronous code together with a bunch of microservices will turn into legacy, which somehow start in docker, balance by the orchestrator and do another bunch of important and interesting things, but ... about vyshmat, I actively progol something on laboratories, but about streams and Rx something heard somewhere? <br><br>  It seems that not to give any, you need to send him home to learn a little, or call for free courses, or for paid ones. <br><br>  It also happens that yesterday's student sat down for really up-to-date information, sorted out and settled in June and after a year or two he was already fumbling well. <br>  It happens, but rarely. <br><br><h4>  As a result, the following </h4><br>  If something does not change dramatically, the next 5 years, each university graduate (if he wants to be a developer) will need another year from above (or while studying at a university, it often happens) to get a little into the real situation in the profession, learn a little, to find a job and somehow get involved, at least, in tasks on legacy projects. <br><br>  For business, this means nothing more than a total lack of working hands of programmers.  A business that is already similar to one another (saytik, store, catalog, play, applet) cannot develop in any new direction, simply because of the brakes on the development side.  And the developers are not to blame - there are not enough people. <br><br>  The end. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454256/</a></p>
