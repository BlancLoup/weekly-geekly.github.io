Indeed, there are so many professions in this world that it is difficult to imagine.  Somewhere it is necessary to stand for hours behind the machine, somewhere - to bake fragrant ruddy buns, somewhere - to shovel piles of papers ... and somewhere - not to do anything :) <br><br> <a rel="lightbox[pics1420]" href=""><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/44.thumbnail.jpg" width="600" height="242"></a> <br><br>  In today's mini-review, I will talk about a small device that can help out in many situations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When I picked up the box, I thought it was a dirty trick.  Looks like it's empty, or ...?  Or.  I was very surprised to open it.

It weighs only 300 grams, which is almost unimaginable for a scanner.  Sizes just over the BMW Z3 :) <br><br> <a rel="lightbox[pics1420]" href=""><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/62.thumbnail.jpg" width="600" height="275"></a> <br><br>  To be more precise - 290x38x50 (mm).  The scanner is completely made of black rough plastic, the quality of the performance and assembly of the case is not satisfactory.  At the top is a large, unsigned gray button, below it, the entire length of the device is a slit for the paper.  Just below is the logo. <br><br> <a rel="lightbox[pics1420]" href=""><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/71.thumbnail.jpg" width="600" height="469"></a> <br><br>  Behind the standard USB-cable is connected, which comes in the kit.  You can meet this in many printers, network drives and other devices of varying degrees of utility.  At the bottom - two rubber legs, thanks to which the scanner always remains in place. <br><br>  I do not cease to be surprised - IT is below the finger-type battery!  :) <br><br> <a rel="lightbox[pics1420]" href=""><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/52.thumbnail.jpg" width="600" height="209"></a> <br><br>  It fits easily into the case (from the kit) - even in it the scanner will easily fit in a pocket, glove compartment, bag or backpack.  What can we say about home conditions, where for the baby there is exactly a place. <br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  I don't remember exactly, but, in my opinion, immediately after connecting the scanner does not ‚Äúaccept‚Äù documents.  More precisely, it works through standard twain-interval, but happiness will not be complete without specialized software.  After installing the software - it is necessary to bring the sheet to the slot, as it literally sucks it there.  Silent "LJ", which is not without reason - after a couple of seconds, the sheet comes out from the back side, and a window appears on the monitor with an image of a scanned document with which you can do anything.  A little more detail - below, in a conversation about software. <br><br>  A4 page with text is scanned on average in 10 seconds - agree, not bad. <br><br> <a rel="lightbox[pics1420]" href=""><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/OneTouch-Aug-29-2009-3.thumbnail.JPG" width="600" height="848"></a> <br><br>  Color photo size 20x30 with a scan resolution of 300dpi - eaten in about 30 seconds.  Quality, in this case, is far from a fountain, but to demand more from such baby ...) <br><br> <a rel="lightbox[pics1420]" href=""><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/OneTouch-Aug-29-2009-4.thumbnail.JPG" width="600" height="422"></a> <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know for sure whether any algorithms-mechanisms for ‚Äúaligning‚Äù the paper / image are applied inside (by hardware or software), but surprisingly almost all scans were even, although I sometimes didn‚Äôt put the sheet very straight.  And yet, it is better to insert the sheet smoothly, perpendicular to the scanner - so nothing will be confused, and the image on the monitor will make you nice) <br><br>  My wife appreciated the device at its true worth - while sitting at home with the child, she does not have the opportunity to fully work.  But she doesn‚Äôt neglect the part-time job - she‚Äôs tied up in furniture and she constantly designs, draws, scans, sends.  Sometimes calculations have to be carried out on paper ... and the scanner came to help a couple of times while the microblogger was fast asleep) Even one night she sent an SMS, the scanner was mega) <br><h2>  Software </h2><br>  There are several programs on the included disk - printer drivers, <b>Nuance PaperPort</b> software for working with the scanner, <b>NewSoft Presto!</b>  <b>Bizcard</b> to work with business cards, the ubiquitous <b>Google Desktop Search</b> for soiling the system and <b>OmniPage Pro</b> - software for text recognition. <br><br>  I will dwell in more detail on the first program, <b>Nuance PaperPort</b> , because I used it most of all. <br><br> <a rel="lightbox[pics1420]" href=""><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/scan-port.thumbnail.png" width="600" height="465"></a> <br><br>  After installation in autoload a small unobtrusive module is prescribed, which I advise you to leave if you have to scan a lot.  Clicking on the tray icon opens a small window in which you can select a profile (document, photo, card, etc.), a program (where the document will be scanned) and a format (BMP, TIFF, JPG, PDF and sPDF are available). <br><br> <a rel="lightbox[pics1420]" href=""><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ot4.png" width="485" height="426"></a> <br><br>  Profiles can be changed, create your own - the settings are very flexible. <br><br>  If you specify that the document be scanned into the PaperPort itself, then all the images will form thumbnails that can be copied, deleted, rotated and do anything at all - conveniently and visually. <br><br> <a rel="lightbox[pics1420]" href=""><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/port3.thumbnail.png" width="600" height="465"></a> <br><br> <a rel="lightbox[pics1420]" href=""><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/prog.thumbnail.png" width="600" height="545"></a> <br><br>  About the unsigned button on the device.  Thanks to the <b>Visioneer OneTouch</b> program, it can be programmed in any convenient way with any settings - for example, simply scan to a specific format, scan + recognize or do something else.  Very flexible so + will save time;) <br><br><h2>  Check weighing </h2><br>  <b><u>pros</u></b> <br>  - Ease of use; <br>  - Dimensions and weight of the device; <br>  - High scanning speed; <br>  - Even in silence, the device is heard slightly; <br>  - Work without an external power adapter, only from the USB-port; <br><br>  <b><u>Cons</u></b> - You can not scan books, thick documents and other non-core items; <br>  - The average quality of the photo scan; <br>  - Price!  (8500-10000 rubles) <br><br>  The advantages of the device also include the ability to scan long documents - long faxes or checks, for example. <br><br>  <b>Advice to the manufacturer</b> : reduce the price. <br>  <b>Liked</b> : the speed of work. <br>  <b>Surprised</b> : the weight of the device. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  I reason as follows: it is unlikely that the manufacturer was eager to make the most modest size, because the competition in this market is minimal.  So it was possible to make the device a little more, to install an ‚Äúadult‚Äù filling, which would allow scanning photos at a good level.  This option would be more in demand - not many people want to spend a cubic meter of space under the scanner, which is used once a week or even less often. <br>  I conclude that the scope was nevertheless only for workers with documentation.  Thus, the device is ideal for workers who have to scan a lot of documents, do it on the road or if there is simply no room for a full-size scanner.  Therefore, we must initially have many factors in mind, evaluate the range of work in advance - so that there will be no surprises;) <br>  The rest - the device was like.  Unusual, small, light, quiet, useful - a great addition to the netbook.  It will be a valuable gift for any office clerk;) <br><br>  <b>PS</b> About paper alignment.  I learned that there is a built-in <b>Kofax VRS</b> , which has already become the standard for professional document scanners.  Oddly enough, everything is written on the official website :) Who cares - details <a href="http://xerox.ru/ru/catalog/159/47580/">on the</a> product <a href="http://xerox.ru/ru/catalog/159/47580/">page</a> . <br>  <b>PS2</b> What would you like to read the review next time?  Offer. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70337/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70337/</a></p>
