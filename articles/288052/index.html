The whole country in a single impulse clung to the television screens and watched Eurovision enchantedly.  Our clever police ensign Polinochka Smolova, in spite of the enemies, did not take the last place.  We overtook the hairdresser from Andorra and occupied the second last!  Hooray!  Although, I don‚Äôt really understand why not singers, but ensigns and hairdressers go to the song contest, but, nevertheless, I am very pleased even to the penultimate place.  In connection with all this confusion, I took upon myself the responsibility to retract from the review in the last issue of my favorite newspaper.  But this issue of "KV" still shows off another review.  It is difficult to refuse the editor when he belches fire, and a slingshot flashes in his hands with an unclear threat.  Against the background, naturally, the song ‚ÄúWould You Love A Monsterman?‚Äù By Finnish musicians Lordi. <br><br>  First, as usual in all serious publications, news.

      Last week, mail.ru blogs made a millionth record, which the postal giant happily told everyone. <br><br>  And one of the largest news agencies, the Associated Press, <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SEARCH_ENGINES_AP%3FSITE%3DNCJAC%26SECTION%3DHOME%26TEMPLATE%3DDEFAULT">announced</a> that now all the original materials of this agency will be provided with links to blogs.  The links will not be slaves, but the miracle of the Internet thought <a href="http://www.technocrati.com/">Technorati</a> service. <br><br>  In glorious America, bloggers were officially equated to journalists through the courts.  Apple, suing the bloggers who told about their new products before the company officially announced them, and demanded to open a source of information leakage, <a href="">lost</a> .  By the court‚Äôs decision, bloggers have the same non-disclosure rights as journalists.  I dug up this information in the blog <a href="http://sellme.ru/">SellMe.ru</a> . <br><br>  Good news for those who are going to make money using blogs.  The American analytical company PQ Media has prepared a <a href="http://www.pqmedia.com/about-press-20060411-amrs1.html">report</a> stating that over the next five years, the advertising market for blogs, podcasts and other ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù will double each year.  By 2010, it will grow from the current $ 20.4 million to $ 757 million. I propose to start preparing piggy banks. <br><br>  15-30% of blog posts are devoted to consumer experience of bloggers.  These are the results of the first Russian study of the marketing potential of the blogosphere.  Agency PR Technologies commissioned by the SF <a href="http://www.sf-online.ru/article.asp%3FOID%3D24999277-A7C8-462C-A337-FADAD5C63267%26magOID%3DE9DDBCF6-12E1-48C0-BFF3-5C4FF65880EA">conducted a study</a> .  Postings in Russian-language blogs made in February 2006 were analyzed.  Since in RuNet there are no specialized systems that study the content of blogs, the Yandex search engine was used for the research.  This study clearly demonstrates the importance of reputable blogs for people who are going to buy something. <br><br>  BBC Corporation was tired to envy mail.ru and decided to launch its blog service.  According <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1760996,00.html">to the</a> Guardian, now the BBC sites will contain information that users will post, including blogs and home videos.  In fact, the BBC Internet resources will become a public analogue of the commercial service MySpace.com. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> is a new service of instant uploading photos and videos to blogs from mobile phones, which quite recently began operations.  According to the creators, with the help of YouTube, in just a few moments, you can upload pictures or videos to your blogs, captured using a camera device or a cell phone.  But we can only lick, because the service is bourgeois.  Although the trend is certainly pleasing. <br><br>  Well, I shared the news with you, now it's time to go to the blogs.  However, again, today I will not traditionally talk about any blog and give a link.  This time I prepared a digest of interesting articles on blogs, the blogosphere and blog services. <br><br>  There are several specialized blog search engines.  I, for example, most often use " <a href="http://blog.yandex.ru/">Yandex.</a> <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/">Blog Search</a> " and <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/">Google Blog Search</a> .  Naturally, they are looking for different ways and the results are mixed.  How so?  What's the matter?  What search engine did the creators build into their brainchild?  An <a href="http://blog.eugeniavlasova.com/archives/%2520programmy_i_servisy/poisk_blogov_i_v_blogah.html">article by</a> Yevgenia Vlasova on her Paradigma blog <a href="http://blog.eugeniavlasova.com/archives/%2520programmy_i_servisy/poisk_blogov_i_v_blogah.html">helped</a> me answer these questions. <br><br>  Sergei Gotsulyak asks the same question as some of the regular visitors to the best newspaper forum in the world: ‚Äú <a href="http://www.gotsulyak.com/2006/05/post42">Blogs - is this serious?</a> ‚Äù The red thread through the text is regret that there are no good thematic blogs in the Russian blogosphere.  Actually, I support him in this statement. <br><br>  On a small unofficial fan blog of the WordPress engine, I stumbled upon a wonderful article, <a href="http://mywp.spb.ru/2006/04/06/kratkaya-istoriya-blogov">A Brief History of Blogs</a> .  It turns out that it took less than ten years for the innocent fun of programmers and graphomanes to become a new type of media.  Here is a quote from the first paragraph: " <em>1994. The beginning of a new era. Student Justin Hall (Justin Hall) first started keeping a diary on the Internet. Sometimes the creator of the first blog is called the famous programmer Dave Winer, but most researchers disagree with this statement "They claim that Weiner's blog, Scripting News, first became widely known among Internet users</em> ." <br><br>  The Ukrainian developer community not only maintains its own blog, but also posts interesting notes in it.  I want to draw your attention to " <a href="http://www.developers.org.ua/archives/max/2006/02/26/how-to-read-blogs-effectively">10 tips - how to effectively read blogs</a> ."  Yes, the time is sure to come when more than a hundred feeds swim in the aggregator with fatty fish, and reading them becomes not a pleasure, but an agony.  Optimize your life! <br><br>  On this today's review can be considered complete.  Read blogs!  Write to blogs! <br><br>  <b>KHALETSKY A.A.</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006220601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 22, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288052/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288052/</a></p>
