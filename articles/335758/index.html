    <ol><li>  What actions do you expect from your program? </li><li>  Why do you expect this from the program? </li><li>  Does the program do what you expect from it? </li></ol><br>  If you can‚Äôt answer the first two questions - good luck with copy-paste, but if you know what you expect from the code and why - there are tools that can help you understand whether the code does what is expected of it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After you are convinced that your expectations regarding a certain fragment of the program were met, or you were able to correct the error, go to the next fragment and check it.  Here are some useful tools to help you get the bugs out of the blue. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Checking variable values</font> </h2><br>  Let's start, beyond the main list of debugging tools, from the simplest and most obvious.  The <code>console.log()</code> command can be very useful for checking things like variables declared with <code>var</code> and <code>let</code> , constants declared using <code>const</code> , <code>arguments</code> objects and <code>this</code> .  At the time of the output of the values ‚Äã‚Äãof these data are relevant, but be aware that sometimes the Chrome console displays the data updated after the execution of the program.  Be careful about the data, followed by a light blue icon with a white letter ‚Äúi‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d3/0bf/c75/9d30bfc75f7bb8503bc9ec27fd0aecbc.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>Work in the browser</b> : be careful with the displayed data, after which there is a light blue icon with a white letter "i".</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">This data may have been updated after program execution.</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF"># 1: Chrome Developer Tools - Debugger</font> </h2><br>  A more reliable alternative to using <code>console.log()</code> is the Chrome debugger.  In order to use it, add the <code>debugger</code> command to the line of your code in which you would like to examine the values ‚Äã‚Äãof variables.  Save the file, then open the Chrome developer toolbar, for example, with the following commands: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs">iOS: Cmd + Opt + I Windows: Ctrl + Shift + I</code> </pre> <br>  Go to the page whose code you are exploring, say, it could be something like <code>localhost:PORT_NUMBER</code> or the address of the page on the site being developed, or, if the page is already open, reload it.  The execution pauses with the <code>debugger</code> command and you can explore the program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11d/df2/010/11ddf2010b2f57e47db3cebbe8384a66.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>Work in the browser</b> : execution will pause at the debugger command and you will be able to explore the program</font></i> <br><br>  Using the <code>debugger</code> command is similar to adding a breakpoint from the Sources panel in the browser, but the main difference to which you should pay attention is that the breakpoints are tied to line numbers.  Suppose you set a breakpoint on line 20, and then reworked the code and deleted line 8. What was on line 20 will now be on line 19 and you will have to move the breakpoint to a new place.  Details on debugging in Chrome and various useful information about this process can be found in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/breakpoints">documentation</a> . <br><br>  Please note that similar debugging tools are available in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools">Firefox</a> , <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/">Safari</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/f12-devtools-guide/debugger">Edge browsers</a> . <br><br><h3>  Chrome Developer Tools - Network tab </h3><br>  If you don‚Äôt know if a server request has been made, go to the Network tab of the Chrome developer tools.  Look at the call list for the request that you are not sure about.  You can check the status code of the request, view the request headers and other information about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2a/611/f96/f2a611f96ac1777d362d4f19d0ab56dc.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>Browser operation</b> : The Network tab of the Chrome developer tools shows server requests.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Clicking the query string allows you to view headers and other information.</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF"># 2: React Developer Tools</font> </h2><br>  If your application is based on React and you need to check the values ‚Äã‚Äãof properties or states, you should get acquainted with the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi%3Fhl%3Den">React Developer Tools</a> extension for Chrome.  It will immediately become your best friend. <br><br>  By adding this extension to Chrome and navigating to the page created with React, you will see the React tab in the developer console, which displays the property and state values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the item you click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed9/60b/3d8/ed960b3d83081aba3755cce6c5bd264c.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>Browser operation</b> : React tab shows property values ‚Äã‚Äãand states if they exist for the selected item</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF"># 3: Debugging Server Code and Node Inspect</font> </h2><br>  So, you are sure that the program works, that the data goes to the server, but you do not know whether Node or Express correctly routes and processes the request.  If you are using an application whose source code you cannot take a look at, for example, it is some kind of API of a third-party service, then read the documentation.  If you develop and maintain the server yourself, then you should get acquainted with Node Inspect. <br><br>  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/">Node Inspect</a> is similar to the Chrome developer tools, but it is intended for server-side code.  Before using this tool, check the version of Node, it should be at least 6.6, and the version of Chrome, which should be at least 55. If these requirements are met, open a command prompt and execute the following command: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs pgsql">node <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">--inspect PATH_TO_YOUR_SERVER_FILE</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  After that you should see a message in which the link is most interesting to us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f64/b27/000/f64b270004d04124430b67aefe293165.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>Debug Server Code</b> : Enable the Node Debugger</font></i> <br><br>  This link should be opened in the browser, after which you can use familiar tools to debug the server code. <br><br>  If you want to be at the forefront of debugging progress, take a look at <a href="https://blog.hospodarets.com/nodejs-debugging-in-chrome-devtools">this material</a> , which discusses setting up an environment for debugging client-side and server-side JavaScript programs in the same window of Chrome‚Äôs developer tools at the same time. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF"># 4: checking server response - Postman</font> </h2><br>  If you are sure that the request has been sent to the server, but you don‚Äôt know exactly what it looks like in response, or even if anything has come at all, Postman will help you understand the situation.  Although this comrade is not a superman from comics, he definitely saved several developers. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs">Postman</a> is a desktop application, it must be downloaded and installed.  It allows you to select the type of request (among them - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), add the endpoint you need, and if necessary, enter the data for authentication, and send the request to the server.  The server response will appear in the application on the Body tab. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db8/9ea/a47/db89eaa47e03df290511e81d8db9b358.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>Work in Postman</b> : select the type of request, enter information about the end point, data for authentication, and click the Send button.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The server response will appear on the Body tab.</font></i> <br><br>  This tool is very useful in cases where you need to make sure that what you expect from it comes from the server, that is, to make sure that the function on the client that processes the server‚Äôs responses can deal with the data received.  Details about working with Postman can be found in his <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs">documentation</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF"># 5: syntax errors and webpack</font> </h2><br>  In dealing with syntax errors, a linter connected to a text editor, such as <a href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> , is very useful.  Error messages in the browser console or on the command line also usually help to understand what you should pay attention to and what line to look for in the text to correct the syntax error.  Another useful syntax checker, although less well known for this quality, is <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/">Webpack</a> .  Yes - this is the same Webpack that is used to compile modules. <br><br>  If the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/">Webpack</a> cannot assemble a module, it will give an error message from which you can learn a lot of useful information.  Therefore, if you refresh the page and nothing new appears in the browser, take a look at what Webpack displays in the terminal and see if it can compile what you are trying to work with. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdf/2da/15a/bdf2da15ad1da827a88bac933f2f83df.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>Working with Webpack</b> : If Webpack cannot compile the code, it will generate an error and information about exactly where, up to the character in the string, it occurred.</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Results: what to do if the error does not disappear</font> </h2><br>  If you, in spite of everything, cannot cope with an error, prepare a short and precise question, ask it to the manager, a colleague, or ask for advice in any suitable forum.  Your problem will surely be solved. <br><br>  Dear readers!  How are you looking for errors in javascript code? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335758/</a></p>
