  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Follow the Summer Olympics with Android</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This year, the honor of accepting the anniversary XXX Olympic Games fell to London.  World-famous competitions are held in this city and its surroundings for the third time.  Time does not stand still, and the list of Olympic sports is constantly changing.  What to say about the tools designed to help lovers of records and achievements - each time the infrastructure becomes better and more convenient.  At the same time, there is an adherence to current trends, one of which is the opportunity to get the information you are interested in in a few taps. <br><br>  Under our consideration were applications containing both the official program of events and general information on the current Olympics, recognized world athletes and the distribution of medals among the participating countries.  It is especially nice to know that most programs carry the status of official applications.  Thus, the information contained in them will be 100% relevant, and its objectivity can be no doubt. <br><br><br><h2>  Join In London 2012 </h2><br>  Consideration of the program should start with a calendar, divided into three parts.  The periods of travel of the Olympic torch, the Olympiad itself and the Paralympic Games immediately following it are marked with a clear color indication.  The application opens on the current day of the week, promptly displaying exactly which competitions will be held today.  The most interesting sports are easy to add to favorites, and events, competitions and news are displayed in separate lists.

The application interface is designed in the style of the latest trends and is optimized for Android 4.0 ICS.  The greatest interest, perhaps, are the detailed descriptions of the Olympic facilities with plans, geotags and information for guests.  Armed with this program, you can not only follow the course of the XXX Olympiad from any corner of the world, but also confidently navigate in the center and suburbs of London, if you are lucky to be there during the Games. <br><br>  Install from Google Play: <br><br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.london2012.joinin"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac0/94c/240/ac094c2403571a641f100df5df4fd83d.gif"></a> <br><br><br><h2>  Olympics 2012 Calendar &amp; Medal </h2><br>  The main thing that they considered necessary to us to bring the developers of this application - the number of days, hours and minutes left before the opening ceremony of the greatest sports festival.  The schedule is filtered by date, the participating country and the sport included in the Olympic program.  In addition, at your disposal information about two hundred states whose teams will fight for hundreds of sets of medals.  The main symbol of victory, bringing glory and honor to the Olympians, is also not deprived of attention and is in a separate section containing descriptions of medals issued for the games in London. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef4/c4c/6aa/ef4c4c6aacdc9fc2fbb422a9c6a1890b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/963/bc6/11f/963bc611fdb3280992a1b79a2d275fb3.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc0/498/018/bc04980185305371adb47f756544b6ca.png"><br><br>  In addition, information about won in the entire history of the Olympic movement awards is of interest, especially since the list is filtered very quickly and the search works in real time.  You will not find the settings here, but you can make friends with the authors of the application on social networks, and this will certainly allow you to receive the latest news about upcoming updates and functional innovations that must appear before the opening of the Olympic Games. <br><br>  Install from Google Play: <br><br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.tag.olympics"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c5c/92d/2c8/c5c92d2c8f90b7aba8aede175697ab54.gif" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br><h2>  Results Olympiad - 2012 </h2><br>  Another application from the organizers of the Olympics, fully prepared for the upcoming events.  If Join In really invites you to join, and it‚Äôs better to come and see everything with your own eyes, then Results is a great tool for tracking your country's success in the sports field.  The main sections are highlighted in a traditional grid with large icons, the schedule is duplicated, because without it in any way, and even here you can find a lot of interesting things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/518/6b6/4ce/5186b64cecb4b7e83531409e6bfcb691.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6d0/3f8/684/6d03f868425011388e270ed4c49492ef.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/64e/8c4/e41/64e8c4e4135363f24a3bd2183fc08627.png"><br><br>  Of course, the distribution of sets of awards will become known a little later, but you can choose your preferred disciplines and become familiar with the legendary athletes now.  In addition, you will be presented with the broadcast from the Games and the results of matches, races, heats and races, all in a convenient and visual form.  The program is designed in the official Olympic symbolism, the history of which we recommend to read. <br><br>  Install from Google Play: <br><br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.london2012.results"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78e/fec/b02/78efecb02b8867db6f17f2622cfc1786.gif"></a> <br><br>  Of course, this is not all programs from Google Play, one way or another devoted to the XXX Olympic Games, taking place from July 27 to August 12, 2012 in London and its suburbs.  Interest for fans of sports and Olympic symbols probably represent a selection of various live or static wallpapers, as well as other utilities that are present in the search results for this request.  We only hope that the mentioned applications will allow you to devote time to our team, cheer on the athletes and enjoy their success, because nothing is more important for victory than the support of fellow citizens of their native country. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148703/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148703/</a></p>
