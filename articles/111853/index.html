After a brief search, I chose LiqPay - this system had no competitors for the tariffs and connection speeds. <br><br>  In just one day we connected to this payment, and everything miraculously worked. <br>  Well, I think they can, when they want! <br><br>  Started to work.  In the course it turned out that the interface of LiqPay is extremely curve.  All the "amenities" were "on the street" and smelled unpleasantly sovoko attitude towards customers - "do not like it - do not use!" 
      <br>

      I am a romantic, damn it!  - I tried to change the situation for the better and offered LiqPay my services for the full or partial redesign of the system with a complete rethinking of the site usability.  I note that I offered my services free of charge, i.e.  absolutely free.  It‚Äôs just that since the creation of the Reformal service, my team has become fairly adept at usability issues and I could bring LiqPay into the divine form quickly and for my wallet without burdensome.  In exchange, he would get a convenient tool for his own business and stop spending tons of time explaining to users - ‚Äúwhat-where-how-why?‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  My interest was clear.  But, apparently, only me.  Because the offer ‚Äúto do better for free‚Äù put the Ukrainian guys from LiqPay into a state of sacred stupor.  And after providing the initial prototype, I was given the spell "wait a couple of days."  Everyone knows that this spell not only paralyzes the enemy for an unlimited amount of time, but also completely discourages "world peace" by improving an individual payment system. <br><br>  In short, I made a full-fledged video tutorial on working with the system for my users and began to live-live-develop business. <br><br>  Nothing foreshadowed the arrival of a white fluffy animal.  Payments went smoothly, the caliper reacted to questions very quickly, and the sediment, which was formed after the demonstration of pofigism by the developers of liqPay, eventually ceased to creak on my teeth. <br><br>  The picture, however, was spoiled by the fact that about once a month, for reasons that we did not understand, API keys refused to work and we had to generate new ones.  But who promised us a harsh peasant tale?  That's right - no one.  We suffered.  And, as it turned out, in vain. <br><br>  Because all these charms were only flowers ... on the grave of the ‚Äúgood-cheap‚Äù service liqPay.  Berries happened later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/84d2f916/9093e488/42bb37ef/e3b10b35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In early December, I accidentally found out from a friend that all the merchants in LiqPay transferred to the new conditions, that the old scheme cannot work anymore, and that now the service does not work with western cards and all the money received should go to the bank account automatically. <br><br>  To put it mildly, I was surprised.  I did not believe it.  I got into the mail to find there official notification of the "beginning of the war."  And nothing.  Neither in the mail, nor in the news - nothing.  Silence!  Just think, changed a few rules that are all turned upside down - why warn about it.  I go to the caliper chat, ask any uncomfortable questions and make any uncomfortable offers to the effect that I don‚Äôt need money in my bank account, but in LiqPay, and that I‚Äôm ready to ‚Äúagree‚Äù and discuss options for working in that way .  They assure me that ‚Äúeverything is possible‚Äù, you just need to fill out a form.  They promise to call back tomorrow. <br><br>  Then everything develops according to the principle of an announcement on a kiosk: ‚ÄúI will be in 5 minutes!‚Äù. <br><br>  It takes 5 days.  I do not call.  I appeal to the chat.  I am asked to fill out a form and promise to call back.  It passes ... Those who wish to meditate go to the beginning of this paragraph and go all the way again.  And then again five.  Until you achieve the feeling of complete colds. <br><br>  My hobby for filling out forms would have remained a hobby, but one fine winter day I found out that my wallet in LiqPay is blocked.  Naturally, just before the weekend.  Of course, without warning. <br><br>  I go to chat caliper.  And there is extremely resentment.  After that, they ask me ... to write a letter somewhere, because  my account was put to check.  And this is after 9 months of work, after verifying the home address, after almost a month of properly filling out the forms of the category ‚Äúcall me, call!‚Äù <br><br>  Stupidly quietly blocked the account, paralyzed the work of the company, otmazali formal "put to the test" ... <br><br>  In the end, a week later I squeezed the official explanation of their actions from this office: <br>  ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we were forced to block your account, because your type of activity is similar to financial pyramids in its structure, and LiqPay does not approve of this type of activity.‚Äù <br><br>  Fine?  That is, the fact that the project pays a reward to its clients for the work done to promote the project, they call the financial pyramid.  <b>qiwi, alfabank, VTB24 work quietly with us, and LiqPay is all in a white coat</b> .  At the same time, PrivatBank (the owner of liqPay) promotes, for example, its credit cards through ordinary agents, to whom% is paid.  And this, of course, is not considered a financial pyramid. <br><br>  OK.  I reason this way: they forgot how to be baptized when something seems to be there - figs with you.  I had this LiqPay in mind.  Give me the paper, take your poop, damn it. <br><br>  But how to pick up your hard-earned money, if in the support chatting rhetoric with "of course, in an hour they will call you back for sure"?  The question, as they say, to a white fluffy little animal. <br><br>  I write them letters, and in response to silence.  I swear in the chat - I get excuses like "we sent you a letter."  There are no letters, no clear explanations - also a complete lack of presence. <br><br>  This is most likely a calculation for the sucker, who will get tired of beating his head against a concrete wall - he will spit, he will drop everything and go.  And the money will remain.  By the way, in my case it is almost $ 3000.  And, having listened to the stories of my Ukrainian acquaintances about PrivatBank service, I understood ... This is not a usual breakdown, this is a strategy!  No fraud, just another way to honestly withdraw money.  In the implementation of such methods, PrivatBank has become as skilled as I am in questions of usability with Reformal.  For example, at PrivatBank‚Äôs cashier, you don‚Äôt just give change in small change, but they will offer to transfer it to some ‚Äúpetty‚Äù account, from which you THEN, if you don‚Äôt forget or wave your hand at all this burden, you can replenish your phone ... a certain amount will accumulate.  How do you think a lot of people ‚Äúpull‚Äù their pennies from these ‚Äúpetty bills‚Äù?  A "five grandmothers - already ruble!" Ordinary sleight of hand. <br><br>  And the moral of this story is as follows: in PrivatBank, the easier it is to ‚Äújoin‚Äù, the more likely it is that you plunge into a typical city ... What you wanted to warn about <br><br>  <b>UPD1:</b> I set myself the task to at least return the money from the account, but apparently - this task should be added to the 5 unsolved mathematical problems of modern times.  Familiar in private advised to forget and not even try - a waste of time.  No Perelman will help. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> whoever is interested - I can post chat logs with an operator from likpey, immediately any desire to work with a similar office will disappear. <br><br>  There are such pearls there: <br>  <b>You:</b> How can I get my money? <br>  <b>Ignatenko Anastasia:</b> You can not withdraw funds from a locked account <br><br>  <b>You:</b> this is just what you want.  But really - the possibility or impossibility of withdrawing or completely blocking funds - is decided only by the court.  Do you have a court decision?  Or are you on the move coming up with solutions?)) <br>  <b>Ignatenko Anastasia</b> : you can clarify this question by writing another letter to monitoringceb@pbank.com.ua <br>  and so on to infinity ...) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111853/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111853/</a></p>
