Nowadays, you can successfully realize yourself, build a business, and gain complete freedom wherever you want it (and where all conditions have been created for this). <br><br>  Flexible schedule, leading to productivity growth, the ability not to waste time on the road to the office, personally created conditions for concentrating on the workflow - all this makes remote work a coveted dream of many office workers.

      Remote work is fraught with many pitfalls (including the absence of non-verbal communication), but rest assured, modern technologies are setting new standards, changing our perceptions of both the work process and the rest.  You can live in a world in which there are no boundaries, if you wish, for weeks not to communicate with living people, to travel and work at the same time, investing free time in creative growth and self-realization. <br>  It remains to solve only one question: how do we build the work process so that work does not interfere with rest, and rest gives strength for daily work? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Destination point - match travel purpose </h4><br> <a href="http://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D3330253%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d49/86d/e87/d4986de87c3144ccba3e9d7ae093d961.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Where to go?  In fact, the destination does not matter.  You can go to Europe and catch dozens of open Wi-Fi networks in the woods or travel for weeks in the mountains of Nepal, looking for cafes with the Internet.  Cheap, simple, exotic, trampled by tourists - all these places on the planet are waiting for you.  If your goal is to combine leisure with work, you should rely on a few basic principles: the presence of a free Internet in the country, the presence of electricity, the ability to create comfortable conditions for work. <br><br>  The last point is very individual, because each has its own requirements for the ideal place of work.  You should remember the main thing: the purpose of your trip is to get the most out of work, combined with rest.  The goals of ‚Äúhave a good rest‚Äù or ‚Äúdo a great job‚Äù alone will only interfere.  In fact, there is no contradiction between work and rest - the second is power to the battery, the energy you need every day and almost absent in megalopolises.  Getting this energy out of space is the meaning of remote work in traveling. <br><br>  If you feel that you were a penguin in your past life, go to Finland.  Love the hot climate - work in the shadow of a bungalow in Bali.  You prefer the atmosphere of the hive, in which everyone is busy with their creative business, go to Europe, where today there are more than a thousand co-working centers, in which, in addition to jobs, there are chillouts, a room for telephone and skype-talks, coffee zones and fenced smoking areas .  You can rent a workplace for just a few hours. <br><br><h4>  All tools for work </h4><br> <a href="http://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D3330253%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b1/c67/630/2b1c6763097b4bab96e70080c0d6d464.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The recipient country will receive from you a little money for a SIM card with unlimited internet.  You will need a smartphone and a laptop.  The fact of having an internet cafe should not embarrass the traveler.  Periodic change of the surrounding space is favorably influenced by mental mood.  Today, you will want to work in the cozy atmosphere of your office, and tomorrow you will go to the beach and, through TeamViewer, will repair the base in Moscow, feeling the boundless ocean licking your feet. <br><br>  Probably, you yourself have long chosen for yourself all the necessary software for remote work.  Jump Desktop, TightVNC, TeamViewer, Google Remote Desktop - thousands of them!  A laptop with a good battery is a pointless thing in an apartment.  But it is worth being thousands of kilometers from the sleeping area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, as you begin to get real pleasure from mobility.  By the way, not only employment in IT predisposes to remote work.  Writers, journalists, artists, musicians, creatives of all genres can try a cocktail called ‚Äúwork is rest‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  50/50 </h4><br> <a href="http://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D3330253%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/432/02e/bec/43202ebec96043b5b146f6f217ab23a5.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Experienced freelancers know that focusing on work at home is a difficult task, especially if you have a family.  In a new country, you can make yourself a schedule of travel / work and stick to it.  For the first 2 weeks, you can only go hiking in the surrounding mountains, and spend the second couple of weeks at a local Internet cafe.  Or the work will take four hours in the morning, at the same time, freeing you the evening hours. <br><br>  Regardless of the style of rest, you must follow a simple rule: nothing should occupy the lion's share of your time.  50/50 is an excellent distribution, but you yourself can change it depending on the strength.  60/40?  Why not.  But remember that if the work becomes too much (and vice versa, it becomes too much daiquiri in the pool under the scorching sun), your performance will decrease.  Do not forget to feed forces from the place of your location and the atmosphere itself. <br><br><h4>  Creating the right atmosphere </h4><br>  The purpose of the trip is to successfully combine work with rest.  Not every hotel room will seem to you a convenient replacement for office space.  Of course, you can work and sitting on a cardboard box under the bridge, but the factor of creating a favorable environment has a significant impact on productivity. <br><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/2772985%3Faf%3D3330253%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e5/6df/a00/5e56dfa007f143c0861cda63ec000bb1.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Let's see what <i>workaholics</i> choose, for whom work is the goal of the journey.  In the photo you see the <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/2772985%3Faf%3D3330253%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post">Hacker house</a> in Palo Alto (there he hides behind the trees ... but what prevents you from working on this juicy lawn?).  Spacious two-storey house with lots of working places.  If you want to feel the spirit of Silicon Valley, getting new contacts, including among startups, if you need a community of professionals just like you, this is an excellent choice.  Take a room, choose a convenient place to work - and enjoy the process, during which you can consult on difficult issues with your neighbors. <br><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D3330253%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddf/aec/771/ddfaec771dc149df982ae659d034d8cf.jpg"></a> <br><br>  For several travelers, couples, an office on wheels will be an interesting option.  While your friend or wife is driving a car, exploring the streets of unfamiliar cities, you remotely solve current problems.  And after a few hours sunbathing on a deserted wild beach. <br><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/455529%3Faf%3D3330253%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d23/db5/f1f/d23db5f1f4ac445fb197539afc0c9637.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Lovers of quiet, quiet comfort make their choice in favor of a secluded office, located in a <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/455529%3Faf%3D3330253%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post">secret house</a> in the middle of the wilderness somewhere in Sweden.  The age-old forest outside the window, the slanting rays of sunlight, barely penetrating through the crowns of trees, do not knock off the highlights on the glossy display.  No agony of life in megalopolises will distract you from pressing matters.  However, the simplicity of the place is deceptive, after 15 minutes you can be in the urban metropolitan area and completely reincarnate as a tourist traveler. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/232637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/232637/</a></p>
