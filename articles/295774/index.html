  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Promotion of mobile applications: lessons learned</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Anticipating the comments of those experienced about this article, that all of what has been written has long been known, and nothing new is said in it, I hasten to say that this is not an abstract article about what the standard techniques and methods of promotion in the mobile market are.  An article about how we used these methods, and what results we got in the end.  All this is accompanied by real numbers and graphs.  We are ready to share such information.  I think it will be interesting even for experienced ones to read and compare with their experience, and perhaps even discuss it in the comments to the article. <br><br>  The story is such that our team of programmers, due to the lack of prospects in the main direction of development, due to a sufficient number of big competitors (.NET components for reporting and data visualization) decided to go completely the other way - the development of mobile applications.  Fortunately, there are tools that allow you to use the previous accumulated development experience, and not start from scratch. <br><br>  You can not say about the marketing department and the promotion of mobile applications.  The promotion of components for developers is undoubtedly different from the marketing of mobile applications.

      The flagship product in this direction has become an application for creating and managing databases for Android devices. <br><br>  All the articles read on this topic (and there were a lot of them), English- and Russian-speaking, in one voice argued that it was necessary to catch as many visitors as possible on your store page and force visitors in the first days after publication (1-3 days). install the application.  The application, which showed a rapid growth in the first days after publication, attracts the attention of publishers, and there is a chance that it will fall into the Featured Apps list in its category or even in the store in general, which will undoubtedly bring even more users and, as a result, profits (you for this purpose they developed their own mobile application).  This strategy was justified when there were not so many applications in the store and new ones did not appear at the speed of light. <br><br>  The result of this approach looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e52/66e/ccd/e5266eccd205987c2af79189a73f150a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The effect is short-lived, and if in 3 days you did not get into the desired list of Featured apps, consider that the efforts and costs did not materialize.  The number of installations will inevitably decrease by several times. <br><br>  I want to talk about the ways of promotion, which we learned from the articles, and how they work and whether they work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the most important - ASO (App Store Optimization) - <b>Optimization for the store</b> . <br><br>  The name and description of the application is a very important part of the promotion strategy, the quality in the search for a store depends on their quality.  And this is your most long-term investment, because from external sources the traffic is declining over time (as can be seen in the graph) - this time, most users are looking for the applications they need directly in the store - these are two. <br><br>  <b>Application Name</b> <br><br>  Mast-hev - a keyword in the title.  And the closer the keyword is to the beginning, the better - the higher the application will be in search results.  But do not forget that reality can give a surprise.  You assume that users are searching for your application or something similar by keyword.  But in fact, it turns out that either people need something else, or in the store search gives out applications that are far from your ideas. <br><br>  So we would advise you to check the name of your application for viability and focus on the desired user (who installs and buys) - just enter your keyword in the store search and look at the applications that Google will find you.  If close to your subject, then everything is OK.  No - invent a new name. <br><br>  We figured it out on our own experience through experimentation.  Our application has gone from Mobi DB to MobiDB Database Manager and subsequently to MobiDB Database Designer.  After the name change, the number of installations has increased, because the application has risen in issuance and has become more targeted for the target audience.  As the name implies, the keyword is ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù, but in the first version of the name it was not at all.  Google indexes applications in the store, like web pages: application name = Title of a web page.  There is no keyword in the title - the application is not shown in the search.  So it was with us.  Therefore, we changed the name to MobiDB Database Manager, which also turned out to be not an entirely successful name, because it did not accurately convey the essence of the application (which is intended not only for managing the finished databases, but for creating them, organizing the data and further maintaining the database).  And we decided once again to experiment - MobiDB Database Designer, as it seemed to us, quite clearly conveys the essence of the application.  Our assumption was confirmed by an increase in the number of installations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c40/211/815/c40211815bbde7878bc99b9b17f80d13.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In about a month, the number of installations increased almost 10 times.  So go to the name of the application wisely, incomprehensible creative names do not give a commercial result. <br><br>  <b>Application Description</b> <br><br>  Despite the allowed number of characters up to 4,000 characters, Google indexes and, more importantly, shows only the first 350 characters to visitors (and less in the mobile store).  Here in these 350 characters you need to manage to fit the number of keywords needed for good indexing and make it so that it remains readable for visitors and makes them click on the ‚ÄúMore‚Äù button, or even better, click on the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button. <br><br>  We changed the description several times (the first paragraph of it) to improve the position of the application in the store. <br><br>  Few know, but the description of the application in the store can be formatted to draw attention to the most important points and opportunities.  List of tags supported by the Play Store: <br>  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11071127/google-play-app-description-formatting">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11071127/google-play-app-description-formatting</a> <br><br>  Be careful with the description, too high concentration of keywords in the description can be considered spam and remove the application from the store (with our two applications it was exactly that, fortunately, we fixed everything in time).  In the Play Store there is no tag field for the application, and I would not recommend adding it to the application description - it can also be regarded as spam. <br><br>  <b>Application logo</b> <br><br>  The application logo is also an important part of promotion in the store.  It is necessary that he conveyed the essence of the application and attracted attention at the same time.  Having read the articles, we came up with a character for the logo, which was supposed to be memorable.  Repeated from the name MobiDB (from consonance with Moby Dick) came up with such a wonderful whale: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/073/3ec/87a/0733ec87a02f50abb835a20716bf62f9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Cute, right?  We also really liked.  But, unfortunately, it turned out to be completely unviable as a logo for the application intended for creating databases.  Rather like a game.  Therefore, a new logo has appeared: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8f4/b3d/751/8f4b3d7511d7ef61ac88ae183000f185.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Already better, isn't it?  It looks like a data entry label, which is undoubtedly closer to the databases than the wonderful blue whale. <br><br>  We changed the logo at about the same time as the name of the application, which brought the growth of installations 10 times during the month. <br><br>  The onset of the material design era has made some adjustments to the logo, it has become more concise, but the essence remains about the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f96/410/0ba/f964100ba5fa67b34913154b9c7f7d29.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Remember that the logo is the first thing that the user sees in the search results of the store.  Try to attract the attention of the right users: if you don‚Äôt have a game at all, not an application for entertainment, but a business application, avoid cartoony and do not overdo it with the character, if you still decide to use it.  (Eh, cute whale was still). <br><br>  <b>Screenshots and videos</b> <br><br>  Screenshots are also very important.  This is an opportunity to show users how your application looks like and what it can do (yes, that's exactly it).  Screenshots must be "talking", Google does not limit the graphics to screen shots alone.  You can easily add inscriptions on them, for example, name the opportunity and immediately illustrate it.  Example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ad3/f92/88a/ad3f9288aee744c0d77bb0d0c7a7de60.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  About the video and say no.  Almost 100% of users who visit the product page will watch your video, if there is one.  Our video on the previous version of the application has about 20 thousand views: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Do2tgEvji4n4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2tgEvji4n4</a> .  Not bad for a highly specialized video.  For a month, a new video about the new version of the product has gained more than 3000 views.  All videos were created independently, now there are enough applications to get video from the phone or tablet screen without the need to root the device.  Well, in Android 5.0 and above, this feature is built into the OS itself.  So it is not difficult at all, but it takes some time. <br><br>  <b>Localization of the application</b> <br><br>  A good way to increase the audience of the application is to localize the application itself and its description in the store.  It is desirable in this order.  Although Google does not insist on localizing the application itself to add descriptions in any language other than the application language. <br><br>  Users who see the description in their native language expect that the application itself will be in the same language.  And it is understandable their disappointment after installing and running the application, when it turns out to be in English, and not in French, for example.  And the appearance of negative feedback from non-English-speaking users is understandable. <br><br>  To avoid this effect, first localize the application.  The cost of professional services is quite high.  Significantly reduce costs by asking your clients for help.  Users of Android devices are quite responsive, and will gladly help you for the paid version of your application or certificate on amazon. <br><br>  We used the services of a professional service and the services of a client-native speaker.  After the user localization, it is still better to conduct the proofing in a professional service, but it is already much cheaper than ordering a translation from scratch. <br><br>  Here is the effect of localization on Spanish (Spain, Mexico): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/00c/3cb/92b/00c3cb92b747082a4fcaa81b64e8b9aa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Localization in Italian: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e51/034/8f8/e510348f82967c2c9ed34391bc6a7f01.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Localization in German: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bfe/26f/ac1/bfe26fac1c6024fe42cf84147f7d6a03.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Creating satellite applications</b> <br><br>  Another way to promote is to create related applications that do not compete directly with yours, but still contain a link to it and thus promote the main application. <br><br>  Our flagship application is designed to create any custom databases.  To promote it, we have created applications that are targeted to a specific category of users, more specialized.  The most successful of them are for inventory and project management, i.e.  special cases of using databases.  Applications are free, but not all functionality is available.  For example, you can not change the structure of the database or use synchronization.  We offer to buy a flagship application to gain access to such opportunities. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : this approach works, we regularly get new customers from such applications.  The advantage is that we reach a larger, more specific audience, the disadvantage is that these applications also need to be promoted in the store so that they can be used to make sense. <br><br>  <b>Promotion outside the store</b> <br><br>  Outside the store, the application also needs to be promoted, but do not expect stunning results.  According to the results of MobileDevHQ research conducted in 2014, only 2% of the total number of smartphone users are looking for applications outside the store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/118/59b/14d/11859b14d0063f5053078bad02c7bd1c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But this does not mean that they do not need to do it at all.  The appearance of links to your store page also has a positive effect on the position of the app in the store, according to the Google employees themselves.  But the links must be correct - at least with an anchor in which there is a keyword, and not just "you can download the application here." <br><br>  Another important point to promote outside the store is to connect Google Analytics ( <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/%3Fhl%3Dru">https://developers.google.com/analytics/?hl=ru</a> ) or any other similar service to track transitions from external sources and be able to evaluate the effectiveness of your efforts. .  For Google analytics to show statistics on referrals from external sources, the links must be of a certain type, otherwise they will be considered direct / none. <br><br>  Generate the correct links will help you a special tool: <br>  <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/v4/campaigns">https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/v4/campaigns#google-play-url-builder</a> <br><br>  So, we are ready to track the effectiveness of our campaigns.  We proceed directly to the promotion. <br><br>  <b>Reviews</b> <br><br>  Today, there are many resources on the Internet devoted to the Android operating system and everything related to it (devices, accessories, applications, widgets, etc.).  Also a lot of bloggers writing on this topic.  It would seem that getting a publication on such resources should be quite simple.  But this is not at all the case.  The number of published applications is growing, and each developer wants to write about his application.  Journalists and editors of Internet resources simply drown in the stream of requests for the publication of reviews.  It takes a lot of effort to draw attention to your application, especially if you want it to be published for free.  Some tips for writing a review request: <br><br>  1. It must be personalized.  Write directly to the journalist so that it is clear that this is not a mass spam mailing.  Refer to the articles of this journalist similar subjects.  Write that he is a real expert and his opinion would be very interesting for you (everyone loves flattery); <br>  2. Write not only about what your application is insanely useful, but also about what benefits the review of the application will bring to the journalist / blogger himself (an interesting topic will attract more subscribers, high-quality content, etc.); <br>  3. Do not insert into the letter the description of the application entirely from the store.  No one will read a letter 2 pages long.  It would be nice in a couple of sentences to explain what your application is for, how it differs from its competitors + a link to the store + a concise list of main features; <br>  4. Limit the total amount of letters to 1000 characters - so you can increase the chance that at least your message will be read; <br>  5. Thank the reader for taking the time to read the request. <br><br>  I must say that our application has received only a few free publications: <br>  <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/mobi-db-manage-your-mobile-data-with-a-database/">http://www.techrepublic.com/article/mobi-db-manage-your-mobile-data-with-a-database/</a> <br>  <a href="http://ru.appszoom.com/android-app/mobidb-database-designer-lite-kfbxy.html">http://ru.appszoom.com/android-app/mobidb-database-designer-lite-kfbxy.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.chriscampisi.com/2014/11/24/five-affordable-apps-for-managing-software-licenses/">http://www.chriscampisi.com/2014/11/24/five-affordable-apps-for-managing-software-licenses/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/5-applications-pour-gerer-les-licences-de-maniere-securisee-39816360.htm">http://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/5-applications-pour-gerer-les-licences-de-maniere-securisee-39816360.htm</a> <br><br>  The effect of the first review was noticeable: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/70e/a92/59d/70ea9259d4fee6b186e224f7eb260a23.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But it did not last long.  Considering all the reprints of this article, new users did not end up with much. <br><br>  There is an opportunity to publish paid reviews.  The cost is on average from 30 to 150 US dollars, depending on the authority and promotion of the resource.  Based on our own experience, we can confidently say that not one of them justifies itself, not to mention the profit from such publications. <br><br>  We did a paid text review ( <a href="http://www.androidheadlines.com/2014/04/sponsored-app-review-mobi-db.html">http://www.androidheadlines.com/2014/04/sponsored-app-review-mobi-db.html</a> ) and a video review ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Def7OFCIUd34">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v= ef7OFCIUd34</a> ).  For the text review was paid $ 100.  With all the promotion and attendance of the resource, the effect was scanty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0a6/06e/ea3/0a606eea3f4ab1668363f1be8664fb7b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For the video review of one of the first versions, we paid $ 150 (since the dollar cost 2 times less).  For the year, the video gained a little more than 2000 views. <br><br>  This is the effect we got: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c58/224/485/c582244852afa224ffe953bde24923ee.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Minor short-term increase in installations.  There was no immediate commercial effect. <br>  For a significant increase in installations with reviews, it is necessary that they are published constantly, because the article about your application leaves the main page of the resource where it is posted in a couple of days, and the number of visitors from it will go down to almost zero.  There are two difficulties in achieving this goal: insufficient funds for guaranteed paid reviews, and the inability to adjust publications by time (constant delays and approvals). <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : do not regard the publication as a means of immediate earnings (long-term increase in traffic), regard it as increasing the link weight of your page in the store.  And spend money on it accordingly. <br><br>  <b>Paid installations</b> <br><br>  There is such a practice - to pay resources (like AppBrain) for recommending your application to their users, and the latter install it.  We worked with this resource, but not for long. <br><br>  Here, what conclusions can be drawn from such a move: the number of installations actually increases significantly, i.e.  it seems to be working. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/32e/061/f6f/32e061f6fb64de0a9c0b32d65e8fb1e8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  BUT!  Users are not targeted at all and therefore are not convertible into purchases. <br>  We undoubtedly received certain advantages from such promotion: an increase in the number of installations and reviews in the store, which plays an important role in determining the position of the application in the store.  Which application do you, as a user, download more readily: an application that already has over 100,000 installations and 4,000 reviews, or an application that has only 500 installations and about 10 reviews?  It seems to us that the choice is obvious.  Store search will also put the application with a large number of installations and ratings to a higher position. <br><br>  The AppBrain campaign is good because it can help overcome the critical barrier of at least 1000 installations in a shorter period.  At a price of 0.26 cents per install is an acceptable option.  With AppBrain, you can get better leads, but it will cost about $ 1. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : Good for improving the position in the store, but does not bring immediate commercial results. <br><br>  <b>Paid reviews</b> <br><br>  Reviews in the store are very important. -,          (  ):   ‚Äì    . -,           ?  , ,     . <br><br>    ,   ,      ,       ,    100%    . <br><br>   ,         .
