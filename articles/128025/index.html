In this article we want to discuss <br><ul><li>  the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa loan service, </li><li>  options for its implementation for online stores, banks and customers, </li><li>  advantages of the system for banks, shops and buyers </li><li>  difficulties and risks of service implementation </li><li>  service scheme and technology </li><li>  existing similar and similar services </li></ul><br>  Comments, criticism, questions and constructive comments are strongly welcome.  So, if you're still interested, <a name="habracut"></a>  go, in fact, to the topic. <br><br><h4>  About the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãservice </h4><br>  E-commerce is developing no matter what.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/113765/">Data from analysts</a> for the previous year are encouraging: there are interested buyers, there is a steady demand in the main market segments, there are many successful and profitable online stores.  Strangely enough, in the current situation, the main limiting factors are technical limitations and shortcomings of sites, complicating the expansion of functionality and the introduction of new services on the sites of stores. <br><br>  One of our friends is the owner of a large online home appliance store.  Once he complained that in his store goods more expensive than 10 000 rubles are not bought as often as we would like, unlike the major appliance stores, where there is an opportunity to buy goods on credit.  And what prevents the bank to issue a consumer loan to an online store buyer?  - we thought, and decided to create a service that would allow online shopping visitors to make purchases on credit quickly and conveniently.

      <br>
      <a href="http://www.conpay.ru/about/">Conpay</a> is a new consumer credit system for online shopping customers that we want to create.  In online stores connected to the Conpay system, visitors can make purchases on credit without queues and documents.  In addition to the opportunity to buy goods on credit, we want to create a service that allows you to choose the most favorable credit conditions from the existing offers from partner banks of the system. <br><br><h4>  How to create such a service </h4><br>  To create such a service, you will need to enter into partnership agreements with several banks that operate in the consumer lending market, as well as with large online stores that sell goods from about 5000‚Äì7000 and up to 100 000 rubles.  Despite the seeming complexity of this task, it turned out that both of them already showed interest in our idea. <br><br>  Yesterday we held a meeting with representatives of the Nizhny Novgorod venture fund <a href="http://basetechnologies.ru/">Basic Technologies</a> , where we showed a small <a href="http://www.conpay.ru/">presentation of the</a> project, a draft of the prototype and the scheme of the service.  Representatives of the fund supported the idea, made several comments, pointed out the main difficulties and risks that we would have to face, but, in general, gave a positive assessment of the work done.  We have concluded a cooperation agreement and received funds for the development of the project.  In addition, representatives of the fund organized several meetings with senior representatives of several Russian banks. <br><br><h4>  On the benefits of service for banks, shops and customers </h4><br>  Let's return, actually, to the idea itself.  The most attractive thing about it is that the Conpay service will be useful for banks, shops and customers.  The following are the main advantages of the system: <br><br>  <b>Advantages of the system for the bank</b> <br><ul><li>  Additional customer flow; </li><li>  Low cost of attracting customers; </li><li>  Showcase online store as a motivating factor; </li><li>  The ability to manage your credit products. </li></ul><br>  <b>The advantages of the system for an online store</b> <br><ul><li>  Attracting buyers with an average level of wealth; </li><li>  Selection of banks and credit products at their discretion; </li><li>  The ability to sell more expensive items; </li><li>  Promotion of online store through the system Conpay. </li></ul><br>  <b>Advantages of the system for online store customers</b> <br><ul><li>  The ability to purchase more expensive goods; </li><li>  Loan processing without papers and queues; </li><li>  The choice of products is wider than in regular stores; </li><li>  One account for all online stores. </li></ul><br><h4>  Scheme of service </h4><br>  Let's try to briefly describe the scheme of the service.  Despite the fact that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying on credit in online stores seems simple and obvious, even the simplified algorithm of the system, which we presented at the presentation of the project, seemed to the representatives of the fund to be complicated and confusing.  However, answering the relevant questions, we managed to prove that the presented scheme is optimal.  Of course, I would like to hear the opinion and reasoned criticism of a wider audience. <br><br>  <b>Scheme of work:</b> <br><ol><li>  The buyer adds goods to the cart on the website of the online store connected to the Conpay system. </li><li>  The store sends information about the goods and their total cost to the Conpay system. </li><li>  The buyer sends to the Conpay system the documents required by the bank for processing the loan. </li><li>  Conpay sends the buyer‚Äôs details to the banks with which the store has a partnership agreement. </li><li>  The bank sends the buyer a loan opinion.  If the conclusion is positive, then the buyer is invited to appear in the bank to conclude a loan agreement. </li><li>  After signing the contract, the bank pays the cost of goods online store. </li><li>  The buyer picks up his purchases from the warehouse of the store or waits for the goods to be delivered by courier. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c24133fc/9a5253a9/5cd39229/08cf6042.png"><br>  <em>The numbers in the figure correspond to the number in the list.</em> <br><br>  As for the interaction of Conpay with online stores, we are creating a special module that the store owner must install on the site.  It will look like a module of the famous <a href="http://www.robokassa.ru/ru/">Robokassa</a> system. <br><br><h4>  About similar credit services </h4><br>  At the stage of discussing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãservice with investors, we were asked a quite typical question about what similar services already exist in banks and online stores.  During the preparation of the presentation, we, of course, searched on the Internet for something similar to our service, and even found a <a href="http://www.rsb.ru/credits/online_loans/">program for online lending to Russian Standard Bank</a> , which already works in some major online stores, for example, in <a href="http://euroset.ru/nnov/credit/">Euroset</a> .  We also found our own <a href="http://www.eldorado.ru/help/credits.php">credit program of the Eldorado store</a> .  But all these systems have many drawbacks, the main ones being the following: <br><ul><li>  Informational interaction between the buyer, the store and the bank is not automated.  The buyer must call from the bank and from the online store to clarify and confirm everything.  This part scares off buyers.  In fact, with the existing scheme of work, the online store simply transmits the customer‚Äôs contact information (including a mobile phone) to the bank.  After that, the bank manager (credit inspector) contacts the buyers for loan processing. </li><li>  There is no mass, since the service is not popular.  Currently, many new online stores are being created in Russia.  It is impossible or too difficult to reach them all and cooperate with all for the bank.  Conpay system allows you to automate the process of interaction of the bank with all stores. </li><li>  If the online store cooperates with only one bank, then the buyer is given the opportunity to get a loan only in this bank.  When you connect the Conpay system in the online store, the buyer has the opportunity to choose which bank to issue a loan. </li><li>  Not enough service and functionality on shopping sites.  Conpay system has a number of additional functions, services and opportunities for the buyer, which allow you to make a purchase on credit easy and convenient. </li></ul><br>  Existing online lending programs are not actually programs.  They only transfer to the bank the contact details of the buyer in case he wants to buy goods on credit.  Then the manager should work with him, and everything happens as if the client himself called the bank to get a loan.  Conpay, on the other hand, should be a much smarter and more functional service that will allow the user to fill out a form only once and upload documents in order to be able to repeatedly contact the bank for loans, making purchases in online stores. <br><br>  Moreover, the buyer receives a preliminary conclusion on issuing a loan from the Conpay system without personal contact with a representative of the bank.  Not all users are ready to leave their mobile phone and other personal data on the site.  When using the Conpay system, the user needs to log in only once during registration.  This is a very important point in terms of psychology.  If the user only needs to press just one button to get a decision on issuing a loan and calculate its cost, and no personal data is needed, the probability that he will use this service increases many times over.  Unfortunately or fortunately, other similar services could not be found.  And it would be interesting to look at the Russian and, especially, the import analogues, if they exist.  It would also be great to hear the opinions of Habr's users about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project, about the service itself, as it is described in the <a href="http://www.conpay.ru/">presentation</a> and in this article, and any other comments from the audience. <br><br><h4>  For readers of Habr </h4><br>  This article was written not only and not so much for self-promotion and public relations, therefore we published it not in the ‚ÄúI am PR‚Äù blog, but in Startups.  We are primarily interested in the opinions of Habr's readers and users, customers and owners of online stores, as well as any other comments. <br>  <em>PS: Many thanks to everyone, especially those who were not too lazy to read the article to the end.</em> <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <a href="http://conpay.ru/">Conpay.ru</a> website, where the project presentation is now located, is correctly displayed only in modern browsers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128025/</a></p>
