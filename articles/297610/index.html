      - To run the process catalysts, pass trial practice tests.  This will allow to find weak points and indicate the direction in which you need to work harder. <br><br>  - If you have already passed this test before, and now you are trying again, determine which strategic mistakes were made during the preparation process. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2) Specific objectives</font> </h2><br>  The presence of specific targets for each direction is a sign of your readiness for the <a href="http://pochemu-vam-sleduet-rabotat-nad-podgotovkoj-srazu-k-dvum-testam-ast-i-sat/">SAT test</a> (assuming, of course, that these indicators are realistic). <br><br>  - If your previous indicator of, for example, reading comprehension was 500 points, then setting the bar at 750 is an unattainable goal.  In any case, without prejudice to health and the nervous system. <br><br>  - Even worse, if you feel a complete disappointment, demonstrating during the next test ‚Äúonly‚Äù 570 points.  70 points - this is progress, and, demonstrating an increase in your level of knowledge by as much as 20%!  You should enjoy it! <br><br>  - In order to achieve a big goal, you have to break it into small steps that are really feasible at this stage.  Having achieved one intermediate success, it will be easier for you to conquer the next peak. <br><br>  - If universities do not expose the results required for enrollment in public access, be guided by the average indicators that testers showed up to you. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3) Clearly defined time frames.</font> </h2><br>  Once you know the date of testing, develop your calendar of preparation for it.  Plan from the goal, that is - in reverse order.  Do not forget about the realism of the plan - even if you plan very important points, the number of hours per day will not increase.  Clearly define when you will work, for example, on the ability to perceive <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/neskolko-poleznyx-uprazhnenij-dlya-razvitiya-navykov-audirovaniya/">information by ear</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4) Relevant load</font> </h2><br>  Does your current work load give you the opportunity and time to achieve maximum results? <br><br>  - Carefully analyze what you already have and what you still need to plan.  Consider class schedules, other important exams, work, and other activities. <br><br>  - Also, do not forget that you are a person, you have a life outside the preparation for the test.  And in general, sometimes you need to sleep. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5) Confidence</font> </h2><br>  A test is more than just a mental exercise;  it also contains the emotional component, which is often ignored by us, despite the fact that it determines the behavior of the person being tested to a considerable extent. <br><br>  - Be optimistic, but know: difficulties and disappointments will periodically appear on your way.  They will be there, so learn to turn them to your advantage. <br><br>  - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-nejtralizovat-prirodnye-mexanizmy-vyzhivaniya-pri-podgotovke-k-testam/">Excessive anxiety and panic during the test</a> - a common problem.  To feel confident, you must carefully study the structure of the test, the requirements, etc. Pass training tests so that no surprises emerge during basic testing. <br><br>  - If you retake the test, analyze your actions in detail during the last attempt.  What did you think, what did you do, what and how did you influence?  What was the most difficult?  What is needed to improve the result?  Such an analysis will help you make the second approach more successful. <br><br>  - Think which sources of the necessary information were the most useful?  What kind of people (teachers, friends, parents, etc.) can help you? <br><br>  These five principles are not just about test preparation.  They are the basis for achieving any goal. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/pochemu-vam-sleduet-rabotat-nad-podgotovkoj-srazu-k-dvum-testam-ast-i-sat/">Why you should work on preparing for two tests at once: AST and SAT</a> . <br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.com/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297610/</a></p>
