  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The child in the family is a geek or we have our own approach</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When a child is born in a family, it‚Äôs damn cool!  As Grishkovets used to say in the film ‚Äúsatisfaction‚Äù: ‚Äúeverything becomes difficult, but at the same time everything becomes simple‚Äù.  So, about simple: there is a huge amount of literature, designed for young mothers.  There is even a couple of books about children written for men (and in very bad language).  But for some reason, very little information, designed for techies.  It is believed, apparently, that our children do not reach. <br><br>  Personally, when I read these books (the first rule is RTFM), I really lacked some clear instructions and options for using technology and various adaptations.  And since all of us sitting here are not just techies, but a bit of technogics and live surrounded by a mad amount of technology, let's see how it could be used for the benefit of a child. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/804/7b8/6f9/8047b86f999574597fb1af61ae272e0e.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So first.  No matter how cool the child is, he will scream.  No not like this.  He will shout.  Somewhere between three and four months, they have a stomach, and as a result they are tormented by gas and colic.  How to deal with this, where it is written a lot, but I'm not talking about that.  I'm about noise isolation.  Well, if you have headphones with noise isolation.  Not a closed type, but such special headphones, delivering sound in antiphase and making absolute silence.  No matter how much you love a child, it will be better if one of the parents fiddles with it, and the second rests in silence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de5/a8c/2a6/de5a8c2a606fa66e7733b2e6f03c2396.jpg"><br><br>  Point two.  The child fell asleep, the parents tortured (but happy) went to another room (well, if there is one) or hid in the kitchen.  Many people buy a baby monitor - a radio station that is turned on by sound.  So, nafig this baby monitor.  If you are sitting on a habre, you probably have a router, which means that the best option would be a web or an IP camera.  And if you add an infrared light, you can look after the child in the dark.  Again, you can from time to time connect from the tablet and monitor the situation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/24f/830/106/24f830106fe38ffd059171feb2b4f4db.jpg"><br><br>  Youtube.  Sorry for the vulgarity, but it is useful.  It is really possible to find a lot of useful information in it, from swaddling video lessons to real life hacks.  For example, I somehow came across this video.  Surprisingly, it works.  Not 100% of the time, but quite often.  In addition to this, you can download all kinds of "sounds of the sea" from torrents.  I use either <a href="http://simplynoise.com/">a white noise generator</a> (I found out about it just in Habr√©) or <a href="http://www.rainymood.com/">Rainy Mood</a> .  At the same time and their nerves soothes well. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LfPLddbeEVo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiSiICRKdl1pU_r7Er4WZtNfK03rw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Third: the child calms down in your arms and slowly (very slowly) falls asleep.  What to do at this moment?  Sitting still is pretty boring.  This is where the tablet comes in handy.  I have a case for this 7-inch Nook Color.  I must say that seven inches fit perfectly on my knee, without disturbing either my child or me.  The 10-inch iPad no longer fits.  By the way, do not stint on the normal cover, which allows you to put the tablet as a stand.  Not the fact that you do not have to stand for a long time, which means that the tablet should stand at a comfortable angle.  And yes, if you play toys, choose something that is one-finger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/36b/3ff/f2a/36b3fff2a34f70e799b45cabdbfdf3ab.jpg"><br><br>  Fourth: applications for phones and tablets.  Here, sorry, full of seams.  There is something <a href="http://obzor.bymobile.ru/tag/%25D1%2583%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC/">in this spirit</a> , but they either repeat the functionality of the baby monitor, or the functionality of a crane, or of a simple diary.  In general, the seams.  Once I came across an application with the text of a large number of lullabies.  In Russian I saw only one where 25 songs are sung. <br><br>  And fifth, final: people, children are worth it! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137107/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137107/</a></p>
