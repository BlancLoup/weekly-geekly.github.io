  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ether through the prism Or new Rocket AC AirPrism</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae9/d43/24f/ae9d4324f87f46418ad7347a1f94f44c.jpg"><br>  Although the Ubiquiti equipment lineup is now several times wider than just a few years ago and includes <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ubiquiti/2QBT">switches</a> , routers, and <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ubiquiti/5JA">relay stations</a> , the most popular and well-known product of ubiquiti is the AirMax and <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ubiquiti/3JYC">AirMax Ac</a> equipment line.  We have already considered Rocket AC - this is high-performance equipment, but, alas, when using even 40 MHz spectrum bands, traditional four-sector construction requires more than 200 MHz of pure ether for maximum modulation.  It is very difficult to fulfill this condition, especially if the equipment is mounted on a common tower and there are interference from neighboring devices. <br>  The reason for this is the insufficient steepness of Atheros chipset filters, which requires the use of guard intervals between sectors and leads to the defeat of the system outside of bandpass interference. <br>  So let's take a closer look at why you need to use guard intervals in a multi-sector base station, and how to reduce broadcasting requirements, while maintaining bandwidth, thanks to the new model Rocket ac Prism (not to be confused with Rocket AC PTP and Rocket 5 AC PTMP) with AirPrism technology second generation and support of all relevant frequencies for us 5150-5875 MHz (fans of the range of 6-6.4 GHz can now re-read our material on the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/comptek/blog/161381/">Nanostation M6</a> , however, we will soon have a new product for them). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Users of broadband radio have long been accustomed to the reconfiguration of the working frequency range of the equipment.  By purchasing a device, for example, Rocket Ac lite, you can choose any working rating from the range of 5150-5875 MHz. <br>  This is convenient, especially when it is not known in advance which frequencies the RFC will issue, or when it is necessary to organize, let's say, test equipment operation. <br>  But there is a negative point in this possibility, namely, the insufficient steepness of the built-in filter of the system. <br>  In the first approximation, to isolate the signal sectors from each other, they should be in non-intersecting channels.  For example, in denominations of 5280 and 5300 MHz with bands of 20 MHz.  However, everyone who tried such a construction in practice, certainly noted that capacity with such a construction suffers, there are repetitions, a decrease in the capacity of the sector. <br>  The reason for this effect is the steepness of the Atheros chipset filters.  In fact, working in the nominal 5280 with a band of 20 MHz, the device hears all other frequencies, just with a lower signal level, and the closer the frequency of interference to our nominal, the less it is attenuated. <br>  " <br>  17. Bandwidth of the UHF receiver <br><table cellpadding="2"><tbody><tr><td>  Received Signal Classes </td><td>  The bandwidth of the MHF receiver MHz level </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  - 3 dB </td><td>  - 30 dB </td><td>  - ___ dB </td></tr><tr><td>  one </td><td>  2 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  four </td></tr><tr><td>  20M0G7D </td><td>  100 </td><td>  130 </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  20M0D7D </td><td>  100 </td><td>  130 </td><td>  - </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Excerpt from the IDFS form - in fact, this means that when operating in the 20 MHz band, not only devices operating in our nominal will interfere with us, but also neighbors at 40 MHz in each direction (3 db. Of attenuation means almost nothing) . <br>  The logical solution is to increase the guard interval to 40-80 MHz, however, spending frequencies on guard intervals is too wasteful outdoors, and the guard interval for complete suppression of out-of-band near noise should be significantly more than 5 MHz, as a result of which systems usually operate in neighboring frequencies interfering with each other. <br>  Is there a solution to this situation? <br>  Of course, yes, moreover, tested by relay stations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/487/5b7/a45/4875b7a45850404aa717e54bd048eecc.jpg"><br>  The traditional relay station works on the principle of a frequency converter: a universal modem generates a relatively low-frequency signal (hundreds of MHz), and amplifiers specialized in frequency bands multiply the frequency to the desired nominal and amplify the signal. <br>  That is, by changing external units, you can get different frequencies from one IDU and good isolation from out-of-band interference, since the IDU always works with a fixed nominal value and can have narrow-band filters with a high filtration coefficient. <br>  Ubiquiti was able to place a similar system in a compact Rocket package (just a few centimeters longer than the Rocket Ac lite). <br><br>  So consider two generations of AirPrism technology. <br><table cellpadding="2"><tbody><tr><td>  Generation </td><td>  Models </td><td>  MHz frequency range </td><td>  Signal processing on the frequency converter </td><td>  Operating frequency bands MHz </td><td>  Max / Min power dbm modulation </td></tr><tr><td>  The first </td><td>  RocketAC ptp </td><td>  5475-5875 </td><td>  Only reception </td><td>  10,20,30,40,50,60,80 </td><td>  22/27 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  Rocket AC pmp </td><td></td><td></td><td>  10,20,30,40 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  The second </td><td>  Rocket ac </td><td>  5150-5875 </td><td>  Reception and transmission </td><td>  10,20,30,40 in all modes, 50,60,80 only in the "point-to-point" mode </td><td>  22/27 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The differences are significant.  In fact, without losing power or adding to the cost, we received filtering not only the receiving signal, but also the transmitting signal, as well as frequencies below 5,475 MHz, which were so lacking before.  Not surprisingly, the early models of the Rocket AC are discontinued, and only the <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ubiquiti/item/R5AC-PRISM">Rocket AC</a> (with Prism 2) and the Rocket AC lite remain in the line. <br>  According to the manufacturer, Prism technology allows to improve out-of-band filtering by 30 dB, respectively, the difference in mutual interference of the multi-sector base station on the Rocket AC and Rocket AC lite will be even greater. <br>  Additional weakening of out-of-band interference allows not only to get more performance in current installations, but also to plan new installations without a guard interval and even install devices on a common three-sector antenna (of course, the devices do not work in one direction, but serve separate 30-degree sectors):
