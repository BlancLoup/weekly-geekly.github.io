  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OpenStack transforms data centers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>OpenStack has the scalability, flexibility and cost-efficiency that data centers need.</i> <br>  <b>Anni Lai, IT product department (data center solutions), Huawei Technologies</b> <br><br>  The ability to virtualize data processing centers (DPCs) based on open source software, namely the OpenStack cloud platform, allows you to solve the most difficult IT problems today - from processing ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù (Big Data) to ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù (IoT). , Internet of Things).  Many businesses and service providers expect OpenStack to help them transform their data centers into scalable automated matrices of physical resources and virtualized services.  These disparate data centers, managed through automation interfaces and application programming APIs, support the use of the DevOps model when delivering software for innovative applications supporting mobility, social networks, and many other types of applications based on virtualization of network functions NFV (Network Function Virtualization). <br><br>  The use of OpenStack in Huawei solutions helps transform data centers to economically support growing loads ‚Äî increasing the number of users, application services, the number of devices, and traffic volumes.

More than 800 companies have already joined the project, including AT &amp; T, Ubuntu, HP, IBM, Intel, Rackspace, Redhat, SUSE, Huawei, Apitra, CCAT, Cisco, DreamHost, EMC, Ericsson, Hitachi, Juniper, Mirantis, NEC, NetApp, Symantec , Yahoo, odin and recently google.  The community has more than 18,000 individual members from 140 countries. <br><br>  OpenStack software is developed as a group of interrelated projects aimed at managing large pools of computing resources, storage resources and network resources in the data center.  These resource pools are managed through the control panel (Dashboard) in the web browser window or through the OpenStack API. <br><br>  OpenStack consists of the following modules: <br><br><ul><li>  Compute (Nova); </li><li>  Image Service (Glance); </li><li>  Object Storage (Swift); </li><li>  Dashboard (Horizon); </li><li>  Identity Service (Keystone); </li><li>  Networking (Neutron); </li><li>  Block Storage (Cinder); </li><li>  Orchestration (Heat); </li><li>  Telemetry (Ceilometer); </li><li>  Database (Trove); </li><li>  Elastic Map Reduce (Sahara); </li><li>  Bare Metal Provisioning (Ironic); </li><li>  Multiple Tenant Cloud Messaging (Zaqar); </li><li>  Shared File System Service (Manila); </li><li>  DNS as a Service (Designate); </li><li>  Security API (Barbican). </li></ul><br><br>  The OpenStack system is ideal for heterogeneous infrastructures and is able to work in conjunction with other corporate and open source technologies.  Since OpenStack APIs are compatible with Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) services, client applications written for Amazon Web Services can be migrated to OpenStack discrete environments. <br><br>  <b>Why OpenStack?</b> <br><br>  Compared to proprietary solutions, OpenStack has several advantages: <br><br><ul><li>  The speed of innovation.  In just three years, the OpenStack platform has taken a huge step forward thanks to the contribution of the global community of developers and users, as well as support from sponsoring companies.  In this way, the OpenStack community demonstrates the obvious ability to develop and hone functionality faster than any individual company working on its own solution. </li><li>  Worldwide quality assurance.  Since OpenStack is an open source project, software testing and bug fixing is handled by a large army of experienced users and developers from around the world working in various environments.  Many manufacturers provide assistance with compatibility testing and certification.  In particular, Huawei‚Äôs special units in the United States, China, Israel and Europe are engaged in compatibility testing and quality assurance of OpenStack-related products. </li><li>  Guaranteed interoperability.  OpenStack supports mixed-type hypervisor environments with the possibility of their future diversification.  This further simplifies management, reduces the cost of supporting the data center and the level of risk. </li><li>  No binding to the supplier.  OpenStack supports hardware and software technologies from all vendors that are compliant with OpenStack standards and APIs.  This advantage minimizes the time and cost of integration. </li><li>  Investment protection.  It is expected that, with widespread user support and investment from multiple vendors, the OpenStack platform will be longer-lived than any proprietary cloud platform.  An exponential growth in the use of OpenStack is projected as the number of enterprises implementing this platform grows. </li></ul><br>  <b>Huawei and OpenStack</b> <br><br>  The FusionSphere 5.0 cloud operating system, developed on the basis of OpenStack, clearly demonstrates Huawei's commitment to the OpenStack ecosystem as a whole.  In 2014 and 2015, Huawei entered the top ten companies of the OpenStack community in terms of the amount of software code developed for OpenStack.  Today, Huawei is the "gold" member of the OpenStack Foundation organization and continues to contribute to its work, as well as participating in the activities of the developer and user communities. <br><br>  Since FusionSphere is based on the original OpenStack system, it maintains support for all hypervisors, software applications, and hardware products certified for OpenStack.  Add-ons developed by Huawei increase the reliability and security of OpenStack in terms of commercial use.  The improvements implemented by Huawei are implemented on the original add-ins and OpenStack drivers and do not make any changes to the kernel code of the platform itself.  This ensures easy integration of third-party hardware drivers into the FusionSphere system. <br><br>  <b>FusionSphere Reference Architecture</b> <br><br>  Huawei‚Äôs service-oriented distributed cloud data center (SD-DC2; Service-Driven Distributed Cloud Data Center) is the reference architecture for converged data centers.  The main goal of the SD-DC2 architecture is to consolidate and virtualize computing resources, storage resources, and network resources within one or more physical data centers. <br><br>  FusionSphere provides a unified management environment for very large data centers containing millions of virtual hosts.  By developing the FusionSphere OS based on OpenStack, Huawei has ensured that FusionSphere is compatible with the widest range of diverse physical resources and software platforms.  All physical and virtual resources - from one or several suppliers, in the cloud or on the "bare iron" - can be combined under the control of one standard unified management system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b6/da5/996/3b6da59969a644e39f9f9d11c53d924e.png"><br>  <i>OpenStack plays a central role in the FusionSphere cloud OS.</i> <br><br>  <b>Optimization for operators</b> <br><br>  The FusionSphere hypervisor uses communication performance technology optimized for carrier-class applications.  The virtualized cloud resource planner distributes them based on the affinity of network elements.  Prioritization of performance policies can be applied to reduce latency.  These policies ensure that virtual machines that perform the functions of a particular service are placed in the same physical cluster. <br><br>  FusionSphere also includes high availability (HA; High Availability) and fault tolerance (FT; Fault Tolerance) functions, minimizing application and system downtime, including resource reservation, fault detection, and automatic disaster recovery. <br><br>  FusionSphere implements distributed software-defined storage (SDS; Software-Defined Storage), which minimizes I / O latency and supports horizontal scaling of storage.  The entire storage volume is divided into resource pools.  Of these pools, resources are allocated in the most economical way to support each type of application.  The intelligent storage resource optimizes load and performance planning. <br><br>  <b>Network virtualization</b> <br><br>  To build fully mesh networks of level 2 in the FusionSphere virtual environment, overlaying of network components based on software-defined network technologies (SDN; Software-Defined Networking) and virtual extensible network (VxLAN; Virtual Extensible LAN) is used. <br><br>  With full information about the physical and logical topologies, as well as about active QoS policies, the SDN controller dynamically selects the best routing paths.  In addition, to increase efficiency and control costs, the SDN controller also dynamically changes WAN routing policies through data center links.  These SDN controller functions are centrally managed and based on open standards. <br><br>  In addition to supporting SDN functions, FusionSphere OS is an ideal platform for hosting NFV infrastructure initiatives (NFVI), currently being implemented by many of the world's leading telecommunications companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e29/5a9/940/e295a9940d2c4a3b98c778db15a4fbf7.png"><br>  <i>Huawei service-oriented distributed cloud data center</i> <br><br>  <b>Development prospects</b> <br><br>  The OpenStack system continues to evolve, providing new services with each new version.  There are already many worthy examples of using OpenStack in Fortune 100 enterprises ‚Äî from Disney and AT &amp; T to RackSpace and Comcast.  The main factor in the growing popularity of OpenStack is the desire of companies to move away from binding to the supplier, accelerate the introduction of innovations, increase scalability and economic efficiency.  Today, OpenStack plays a significant role in the data center transformation process. <br><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/huaweirussiaofficial">vk.com/huaweirussiaofficial</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/huaweirus/">www.facebook.com/huaweirus</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/huawei-russia">www.linkedin.com/company/huawei-russia</a> <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/huaweirus">twitter.com/huaweirus</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282365/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282365/</a></p>
