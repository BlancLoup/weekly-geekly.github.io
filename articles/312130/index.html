A company that promises a double salary, or, even worse, false dreams that you have dreamed of for years.

      The words of the founder of Apple are so strong that many do not try to penetrate into their essence.  People throws to extremes.  Some people quit their jobs and try to make money on a hobby, others, having tried it, become frustrated and, denying any advice, become dry realists.  In the end, some succeed, others fall, despite the fact that they were smarter and, at some point, richer. <br><br><h3>  Favorite work is not a guarantee of happiness </h3><br>  Everyone understands that a favorite activity makes a person happy.  The second irrefutable fact is that in order to survive, we need money (if you are not able to grow food, sew clothes on your own).  The obvious option to be happy is to find a way to make money from your hobby.  This is true, but there is another unobvious way. <br><br>  <u>Two strategies for finding happiness:</u> <br><br>  1. You take your favorite activity and think about how to earn it. <br>  2. You set up the flow of funds for a small time (about this below) and free time doing your favorite activity. <br><br>  Both options are good.  In any case, you become financially independent and do what you love.  But many are frightened by the thought of taking the risk and becoming an entrepreneur.  And this is understandable.  But, having read this article to the end, you will understand that the risk is to leave everything as it is. <br><br><h3>  Salary does not make you rich </h3><br>  Calculate your current income, examine the salaries of leading industry experts and compare with personal goals.  If your desires are not so modest, you will want to earn more.  You can work 60 hours a week, but you still reach the ceiling.  And all because money is an endless resource, but your time is not. <br><br><h3>  How to make a lot of money </h3><br>  It is not necessary to become an entrepreneur to increase your income several times.  And it is not necessary to invest millions in business development.  There are much easier ways to earn extra money. <br><br>  <u>Selling your skills</u> <br><br>  The first option is freelance.  At the age of 19, I managed to earn 2 thousand rubles per hour, despite the average quality of work.  Constantly replenishing my portfolio with work, I managed to attract attention and receive several orders a month. <br><br>  The second option is content.  You create a small course, book or service with paid access and invest several thousand rubles in promotion. <br><br>  <u>Selling someone else's skills</u> <br><br>  Looking through profile groups in social.  networks, I stumbled upon a lot of pretty good portfolios.  The authors of the work lacked entrepreneurial skills to tell about themselves and start receiving orders.  In one act, I helped myself and them by posting their work on freelance resources.  As a result, young specialists received orders and developed, and I took a small percentage of each client. <br><br>  The advantage of this method is small time costs. <br><br><h3>  You do not need to leave work </h3><br>  There is no risk. <br><br>  You should not leave the current job, if your additional income does not cover all costs.  Many do not even begin, because they are afraid of losing time on activities that may be useless.  And the truth can, but what do you lose?  You will lose much more if you do not try.  The month of solid work and several thousand rubles for the promotion in the perspective of the whole life are negligible when, as a result, you can get is limited only by your dreams. <br><br><h3>  How to start </h3><br>  It is important to bring good habits into your life.  For example, every morning you are engaged in the design of the portfolio, or stay at work for 30 minutes and find young freelancers (or working on your own idea).  The main thing - to determine the daily rate. <br><br>  While working on the first manuscript, I wrote every morning for 15 minutes.  A month later I got plenty of bulk material with which to work.  Start small, otherwise drop everything halfway and then you will definitely lose time. <br><br>  <i>Article in topic: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/311516/">Success on autopilot.</a></i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/311516/">9 habits that changed my life.</a></i> <br><br><h3>  How to buy happiness </h3><br>  A month ago, I tried to make a list of 100 goals.  After analyzing all the goals, I realized that each of them can be divided into two categories: <u>to have (have)</u> and <u>to do (do)</u> .  I was interested.  I began to remember moments when I was happy.  I remembered a walk in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãa goal scored in the final, a visit to a pleasant place, writing an <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303110/">article</a> that almost 90 thousand people read.  They all belonged to the category ‚Äúto do‚Äù.  Hence the result: <br><br>  You can buy happiness by investing in things from the ‚Äúto do‚Äù list. <br><br>  Try to make such a list.  After that, select goals that can be realized in the near future and work on them. <br><br><h3>  How to set quality goals </h3><br>  They should be ambitious and inspire you every morning despite the weather, conflicts or bad mood.  After all, it is in the movement for something meaningful that we are truly happy.  Psychologist, business coach and active reader Sergey Kalinin, at my request, shared three tips for setting quality goals. <br><br>  Qualitative goals: <br><br>  - are born inside, and are not subject to trends and fashion trends; <br>  - should be closely connected with your personality, and not contradict it; <br>  - are achieved by activities that bring you pleasure. <br><br>  Even a favorite thing can cause dislike for some time.  It is important to control yourself and go forward step by step.  To avoid burnout, use the <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><b>SmartProgress</b></a> target achievement service.  The algorithm is simple: set a goal and break it into stages.  Achieving even the most ambitious goal can be planned.  You just have to follow the plan and see how dreams turn into reality. <br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/623/b96/75d/623b9675d4be4ad69974a661aae30321.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  Balance.  With him, we began to talk about happiness.  It is really important, because only with good health, financial prosperity, interesting work and a strong family can we call ourselves happy.  Set yourself 4 goals, one for each item.  Do this every month and your life will change for the better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312130/</a></p>
