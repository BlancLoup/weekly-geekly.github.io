  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the Bluetooth speakerphone Parrot MINIKIT Neo: talk "without hands" in the car</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Abandon conversations at the wheel is almost impossible.  The only exception may be motorists who go on the road several times a week or those who simply don‚Äôt talk.  Otherwise, you have to take care of the minimum distractions to the phone while driving.  That is, to take care of some additional device with the function of hands-free.  As a result, attention does not dissipate, hands remain on the steering wheel, and the valuable call is not missed.  Not all citizens buy cars in the configuration, different from the base.  As a result, the built-in speakerphone is missing by default - and there is a need to learn how to ‚Äúarmless‚Äù control the phone.  Purposeful search led me to a device called Parrot Minikit Neo.  This is nothing more than a speakerphone - a hands-free device with a Bluetooth connection to the phone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/665/a1b/8bf/665a1b8bf8705e97716df1f68bfee50d.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It turned out that the brand is not Chinese at all and has nothing to do with Asia.  The whole process from development to release takes place within the borders of France, which in itself inspires confidence.  Along the way, it turned out that Parrot is also a dominant player in Europe with approximately 80% of the market.  Plus, Parrot speakerphones are installed by default in cars of many well-known brands such as Peugeot and Nissan.

    <h5>  Package and appearance </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c0f/f0a/12e/c0ff0a12e4bd1b98c314eb62614c264c.jpg"><br><br>  In the transparent packaging with the device was found instruction, microUSB cable and ‚Äúcharging‚Äù for the cigarette lighter.  The charger is made detachable, so the bonus is that the customer gets the charger from the cigarette lighter with USB output and the cord.  which can be used to charge at home, for example, from a computer. <br><br>  The device is made of matte plastic, so it was not necessary to wipe it regularly during operation.  The outer side is painted black, the inner opposite is absolutely white. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d46/4ea/50c/d464ea50c3daa8703d8fa302cb6f8605.jpg"><br><br>  With the build quality of a full order, and the form itself Neo assumes a tightly knit body.  Interestingly, the oblong area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe speakerphone was given a separate name ‚ÄúNTX Vibration Panel‚Äù.  The hull shape is naturally curved in order to be attached to the sun visor. <br><br><h5>  Push-button control </h5><br><br>  Despite the fact that Neo is designed primarily for voice control, there were physical buttons on the gadget case.  So, the red key is designed to reset the incoming call, end the call and exit their menu.  Green switches the device to private mode, allows you to receive a call, and also includes a menu and activates voice dialing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b97/674/e98/b97674e9867270ffb38d86d4c7a5e762.jpg"><br><br>  The on / off button in addition to the obvious tasks activates the message about the level of charge of the battery.  Between the red and green keys there is a control wheel giving access to the menu, switching between sections and volume control during a call. <br><br><h5>  We connect </h5><br><br>  Connecting to any phone does not need to be configured every time.  After the first connection in the future, the connection is established automatically, although the Android-smartphone may require confirmation of the connection.  With each pairing, Neo scans the phone book and adds new contacts to its memory, if any.  During the first connection, the speakerphone gives voice prompts, so I had no difficulty. <br><br>  To communicate with a smartphone using Bluetooth version 3.0 and the protocols HFP, OPP, PBAP and A2DP.  The latter means the transfer of stereo.  Therefore, if the phone speaker is suddenly too quiet for the sound of navigation prompts, 3 W of the speakerphone is always at our service. <br><br>  As it turned out, Bluetooth alone wasn‚Äôt limited; NFC wireless technology is also supported.  Currently, it is becoming increasingly common among smartphones with Android and not only.  And not only expensive ones - budget items like the Huawei Ascend Y100 are already encountered.  NFC communication does not require any manipulations with PIN input, it is enough to attach the phone to the gadget. <br><br>  On the one hand, Parrot claims that its speakerphone is 100% compatible with any Bluetooth phone.  However, for doubting customers on the company's website there is a convenient form with a complete list of ‚Äútubes‚Äù, which will have everything in order with Neo.  By the way, the speakerphone firmware is regularly updated, after all, every year hundreds of new phone models enter the market.  To install the updated firmware versions, you need to connect Neo to the computer and move the required file to the device memory.  Just do not forget to activate the update installation item in the Neo menu before this. <br><br>  Only two phones can be connected to the Neo at a time, only one of them will be used for outgoing calls.  However, no one bothers to make a quick switch with changing the status of the "main".  The device memory is designed for storing profiles of ten phones.  If we want to add one more - if you please, delete any old one. <br><br>  Neo's basic mode of operation is called Ultra Low Power Mode.  This means that the speakerphone is turned on only when we get into the car - thanks to the vibration sensor in the Neo.  If there is no connection with the phone for 5 minutes, the device is turned off.  Just in case, I will mention that the connection with the "tube" is maintained at a distance of about 10 meters. <br><br><h5>  Battery </h5><br><br>  The device was with me just a few days, so I could not get a personal opinion about its built-in battery.  According to the manufacturer, in the talk mode the Neo will last 10 hours, and the wait is possible for 6 months. <br><br>  The total charging time is about 3.5 hours; at the end of the process, the LED indicator on the left goes out.  Battery capacity - 1000 mAh. <br><br><h5>  Make and receive calls </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d9/ed7/dcf/5d9ed7dcfaa8678067e45b49282060ae.jpg"><br><br>  In the case of an incoming call, there are two options for voice commands: either ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù or ‚ÄúReject‚Äù.  If you need to call someone to the subscriber, first activate the speakerphone with the keyword "MINIKIT".  Next, listen to the question "Who do you want to call?" And call the contact.  If a person is recorded in the phone book with the name and surname, the order of their pronouncement is not fundamental.  Additionally, Neo can clarify whether to call a home or mobile number.  I didn‚Äôt need to get used to the speakerphone, I didn‚Äôt have to raise my voice while pronouncing the names. <br><br>  The call quality is good, the callers clearly heard me, and I, in turn, left a volume margin of about a quarter of the Neo wheel.  Noise reduction and elimination of the echo effect in Neo are spelled out with special advantages and, judging by my conversations, really work. <br><br><h5>  About Android and iPhone </h5><br><br>  For smartphones, Parrot offers to download the Parrot MINIKIT Neo App Suite application, which contains some very useful features.  If the incoming call is rejected, the subscriber will be sent an SMS with text that you can write yourself.  When we leave the car, the program remembers the GPS coordinates of the position of the car.  Lost a car in the parking lot?  App Suite to help you.  At the same time, the application will turn on the timer and remind you to go to the parking meter. <br><br>  Truckers and those who spend behind the wheel a lot of time, useful installation of the duration of driving, followed by a reminder of the need to rest.  Switching Neo on and off when the App Suite is in place happens under the user-selected tunes.  Finally, there is a choice of built-in voice recognition smartphone, including Siri.  The application also displays information about the Neo language and the speakerphone firmware version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26b/d6b/083/26bd6b08395777a86bf0433b37c328a4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/91a/896/306/91a8963067806c7f79ab9b7a9b222ee4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80e/af2/6b8/80eaf26b89b8e1ac61eedc36ffa4179a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98f/dbd/ef4/98fdbdef4a731c7eff67cb7d29c9d5b0.png"><br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br><br>  For 3,900 rubles, the device fully justifies the cost of its acquisition.  The controls (both button and voice) are well thought out, the program for smartphones is available, there are no complaints about the quality of communication.  Owners of phones with NFC will find another area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplication of technology "in the home."  Therefore, if you are looking for ways to conveniently work with the phone on a hands-free basis, it‚Äôs worthwhile to pay attention to Parrot Minikit Neo </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156705/</a></p>
