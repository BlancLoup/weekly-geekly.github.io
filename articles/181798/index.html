That is, to do what you like, what is pleasant.  Like to watch House-2 - look, like to read - read, like to fry kebabs with friends - please.  The main thing is for you to be in pleasure. <br><br>  But if you can not forget about the work, even for barbecue, then you will only trans.  Trans is the most effective and deepest rest.  A better rest is simply impossible :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The most interesting thing is that a person spends a lot of time in trance, but this is so commonplace that most people don't even notice it.  You had, for example, such that you get on a bus, car, subway, train or some other transport, think about something, do you notice, then look, but have you already passed your stop?  If it was - congratulations, it was a trance.

      You probably already understood that if people spend so much time in it, then there are plenty of ways to dive into it.  You can, for example, look at the wall, gradually expanding the field of view.  You can sit up straight, get comfortable, put your hands on your knees, close your eyes and pay attention to the sensation in your legs, where they touch the floor, the surrounding sounds, the sensations in the lips, the back of the head, on the tongue.  Notice how the sensations in the hands change and how the air slowly enters through the nostrils and fills your chest.  And then it goes smoothly, slightly warming the nose.  Observation of the breath soothes ... <br><br>  You can, of course, contact the Gypsies at the station, but the most common method is art.  It happens that there is music that takes you, there are such pictures or photos, books, but the surest way is a good movie.  If the director with the screenwriter worked out his salary, then when the last scene is replaced by captions, you seem to come back from another world, you want to breathe deeply, stretch, and then you look around and notice that something has changed, it has become different, not such as it was two hours ago. <br><br>  But there is not always a good movie, and sometimes you just don‚Äôt want to watch or listen.  I don't want anything at all.  That is, there was an overdose of work or "rest."  In this case, go <a href="http://realyoga.ru/audio_relax">here</a> .  We download files with the signature ‚ÄúShavasana‚Äù, select the appropriate voice, expel cats, dogs, etc., we ask the house for half an hour of complete silence.  Then we close windows and doors, turn off phones, Skype and everything that can suddenly make a sound or somehow disturb, spread a blanket or rug on the floor, dress so that it is warm and comfortable, turn on the playback, lie down and do what we say. vote. <br><br>  Of course, Savasana, this is not optimal trance induction, but a daily fifteen minutes in a few weeks can change your life for the better.  (It can take months or even years for especially diligent, assertive and result-oriented;) <br><br>  PS If anything - questions in the comments or in a personal.  You can add an article to your bookmarks: useful if questions arise in a month or two :) <br><br>  PPS If you don‚Äôt like the overly vigorous style of a glossy magazine for ladies, I can write an article with ‚Äútechnical details‚Äù of trance guidance, its role in the psyche, etc. We vote. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> if you do not agree with something, speak in the comments or in a personal.  I don‚Äôt feel sorry for karma for you, but judging by the turning point in the voting process, I‚Äôll have to write another article for geeks :) <br>  <i>This does not apply to those who hate me personally, minus health.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181798/</a></p>
