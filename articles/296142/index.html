Count the number of theses and put in the title.  Voila! <br><br><h2>  <strong>2. Lists are often divided</strong> </h2><br>  This is the top of the Sherah and Likes for a week on Surfingbird: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5d5/a16/6aa/5d5a166aaaf416ce7ab6bf0e4d925fe9.png" alt="3jBPcmNd5gYcxnqTxGmVRO47qRFeSkBnsg72XY_EMbU" width="702" height="495"></a> <br><br>  Lists are the format of pure, like a tear, virality.  Actively Sherut except tests.  Or <a href="https://blog.relap.io/2015/10/22/media-change-for-engagement/">seals</a> . <br><br><h2>  <strong>3. Lists make people happier</strong> </h2><br>  This is not what we came up with.  This is the professionals say. <br><blockquote> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fe1/102/f8e/fe1102f8ec6f8cd73e5e208199d4281d.jpg" alt="adme" width="172" height="172"></a> <br><br>  <b>Ksenia Lukicheva</b> Creative Director, ivi, <br><br>  ex-adred adme: <br><br>  We are often criticized for using numbers in headlines.  And it works very well.  Man is a chaotic being, this chaos infuriates and unnerves, and man subconsciously looks for a way to organize it within himself, without realizing it.  And when he sees the numbers, he thinks: oh, now everything will be laid out for me, and he clicks. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9ff/b79/88c/9ffb7988c41025611df6efd5a15627b0.jpg" alt="222786_10151255212767124_1437918743_n" width="170" height="164"></a> <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Matskevich</b> COO Surfingbird <br><br>  People like lists because they are lazy, but they really want to feel smart.  Almost any text of more than one paragraph you want to quit without reading it up.  The user opens a long text and at some point begins to think what to eat - a great idea.  But no one likes to feel like a person who wants to devour.  Everyone loves to feel like intellectuals.  And the list is, in fact, several small texts completed within the meaning of the text. <br><br>  The structure allows you to stay on any of the items with a sense of satisfaction.  User thinks: ‚ÄúI got what I wanted.  Everything that comes next is not interesting for me.  I myself know what to read and what not.  I'll go eat something".  The list gives us a chance to feel like independent people who make decisions themselves, and not the dull shit that they need to read to them.  From the list, the user in any case will leave in a good mood, and he knows it.  Therefore, opens them again and again. </blockquote><br>  The task of the number at the beginning of the title is to give the user confidence.  The number is a predictable value and it eliminates the frustration of the unknown.  Is this what any ad is seeking? <br><br><h2>  <strong>4. This is a timeless classic.</strong> </h2><br>  The first list is the 10 commandments.  And it is difficult to argue that part of the secret of their centuries-old popularity lies in the successfully chosen format.  The well-known BuzzFeed grew up on lists (and quizzes).  And it brought results.  All picked up the trend.  At some point, it became clear that any garbage in the form of a list will collect more views! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/550/596/8a6/5505968a6c916ab7e5dd0e88fada401b.png"><br><br>  Lists make all and sundry.  But this is not a reason to spit and abandon the format.  Even if you do not write about lipstick and seals, but do financial analytics. <br><br>  The list is convenient.  The main thing is that its content is relevant to the interests of the audience.  Read the usual review, but the list will be read more times and with great pleasure. <br><br>  Lists are not shy about big media and serious uncles in suits.  Still in doubt?  Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-03/top-10-rising-and-falling-buzzwords-in-tech-job-postings">does</a> it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9a8/acc/123/9a8acc123933328bbc660312a1fda087.png" alt="image"><br>  Do and you. <br><br><h2>  <strong>5. Lists can recycle other texts.</strong> </h2><br>  You have written a detailed text that tells about the product.  But, most likely, it turned out too heavy or difficult.  You can always reformat it into a list.  Or a few. <br><br>  Already in the format of the list, you can rank its parts as you need.  Even on a serial number, you can speculate and collect additional traffic or comments. <br><br>  In the form of lists is very convenient to do native advertising.  It still remains an advertisement, but it has all the advantages of a list. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bd6/c9e/0af/bd6c9e0afd960cb06917a6d60ee82ce4.png" alt="image"><br>  An example of native advertising in the form of a list on TJ. <br><br><h2>  6. Lists are easier to structure </h2><br>  Lists are faster and easier to do.  A copywriter hired for a couple of texts, who may not fully understand what you are doing, will rather compile a list rather than write a long and competent text on your subject matter.  Because a long text needs a good structure, sometimes even intrigue, so that the reader can read it to the end. <br><br>  Without a clear structure, the reader will decide that you have gone to the roof, and go to competitors.  For such a text you need a good author.  And, most likely, you are not ready to hire him. <br><br>  This problem is completely devoid of lists.  List as a format is already structured. <br><br><h2>  <strong>7. Lists can repack content</strong> </h2><br>  Why not make a selection of the best articles that came out in your own blog?  First, you reactivate old texts and collect additional traffic.  Secondly, show what topics have already been raised. <br><br>  You can also <i>supervise</i> someone else's content ‚Äî do selections of articles, videos, images that other companies or people have created.  You advise and get loyalty (and share some traffic). <br><br>  The main thing in this case is not just to collect and rush into the reader, but to explain why you chose this content.  Any value judgment or commentary creates additional value and makes such a list an independent material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/499/4ca/15e/4994ca15ebf8173b44ecd872a2e4ae80.png" alt="image"><br>  We can do that too. <br><br><h2>  <strong>8. Lists can be made from anything.</strong> </h2><br>  Hair care products, ryazhenka, dictators of Latin America.  Lists are a universal format in which you can talk about anything. <br><br>  You can outsmart all and create a list of lists.  For example, guys from ‚ÄúAmplifer‚Äù blog <a href="http://blog.amplifr.com/posts/daydzhest-daydzhestov">published a</a> list of digests. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6ca/69e/541/6ca69e541bcab407baf32821afc2c91d.png" alt="123456789" width="702" height="447"></a> <br><br><h2>  <strong>9. Lists more convenient to distribute</strong> </h2><br>  Lists distribute easier than ordinary texts.  First of all because of the title.  You simply share text in social networks in the accounts of employees, in thematic communities, and then enjoy the traffic. <br><br>  If you decide to do native advertising in the form of a list, you will find that it is much easier to distribute.  Because of the format, you will collect significantly more views.  <strong>According to Relap statistics for October, native ads with headlines-lists collected 3 times more clicks than other headlines.</strong> <br><br><h2>  <strong>10. Lists are cool</strong> </h2><br>  In fact, we gave only 9 reasons for the coolness of text-lists, and 10 points were inserted for a beautiful title and we write this paragraph just to fill the place. <br><br>  At The Guardian, a ride, a ride with us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e14/665/e10/e14665e10b17096517dc2d3bb0e98187.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296142/</a></p>
