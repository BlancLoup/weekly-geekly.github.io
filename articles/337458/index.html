So say, ‚Äúsmall party‚Äù.  We decided to present you a detailed interview with Pavel Kozlovsky, a member of the Association, the author of the oldest <a href="http://keepsoft.ru/hbk/">applications</a> in the niche <a href="http://keepsoft.ru/hbk/">for personal finances and family budget management ‚ÄúHome Accounting‚Äù</a> (successfully developed since 1998), in which he shares his experience of participation in ISDEF.  Pavel has been at our club for 15 years and tries not to miss his events either in spring or in autumn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e90/f16/ba5/e90f16ba5a5149f0a24ce864e108c57c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Organizing Committee: Pavel, what is ISDEF for you?</b>

      <b>Pavel Kozlovsky:</b> ISDEF for me is a meeting with old, good friends, there are some practical benefits to this.  ISDEF is a club of successful top-level IT entrepreneurs, sharing experience with interesting smart people is always useful.  It is especially valuable that in our club it is interesting to discuss plans for the future, current problems and share experiences, openly concealing nothing.  This is rarely seen anywhere else.  ISDEF is also a club where you can find good specialists and employees. <br><br>  <b>Organizing Committee: How long have you been a member of the Association?</b>  <b>How did you get into it?</b> <br><br>  <b>Pavel Kozlovsky:</b> Probably 15 years ago.  I got to the conference literally in the second or third year, since the association was only then formed.  Since we always communicated with colleagues via the Internet, found out about ISDEF, I wondered what it was.  I came to see for the first time and since then I have not missed any conferences any more - neither autumn nor spring.  Going to continue in the same vein! <br><br>  <b>Organizing Committee: What exactly hooked up the conference?</b> <br><br>  <b>Pavel Kozlovsky: It</b> hooked that in one place a large number of people gather who are engaged in the same business.  That is, you find yourself in an environment where everyone speaks the same language, have the same problems, are looking for their solutions.  Communication takes place in a professional community, which in its time was not at all.  [‚ÄúSpeech on the Russian-speaking community of owners of IT businesses on their own software products‚Äù - note of the organizing committee].  Later, when new people began to appear, of course, they began to exchange more experiences.  I hired employees from ISDEF.  In general, ISDEF is something like energy pumping and combat testing.  If people have associations for some time, then you can deal with them. <br><br>  <b>Organizing Committee: Did anything change during the life of the conference?</b> <br><br>  <b>Pavel Kozlovsky:</b> Her main idea and promise have not changed.  ISDEF is a private club, which is entered upon the recommendation of two people, which eliminates unwanted or untested people.  It was founded as a community of top managers, employees of the management team, and it remained.  There are both large and small companies.  From the changes - companies that were small at the beginning, managed to grow out of their framework and became real "monsters".  The same Bitrix, softkey, etc.  That is, in principle, by and large, nothing has changed.  There is less advertising.  We are not interested to listen to advertising from year to year, it is more interesting to listen to the exchange of experience, to share something new. <br><br>  <b>Organizing Committee: How do you see the value for yourself in participating in ISDEF?</b> <br><br>  <b>Pavel Kozlovsky:</b> There are already quite a lot of such conferences and meetings.  ISDEF is a small association (300 members and active assistants), it‚Äôs not a thousand people.  I know almost everyone in it, I know everyone personally.  One of the pleasant sides is that you come once or twice a year to a conference, you see friends, you communicate ‚Äî this is very useful, positive.  And, again, the same friends, people with whom you already know, can tell you things that you will not hear about in another place.  Secret, their achievements, life hacking - quite a lot of valuable information can be taken out.  ISDEF is always a small emotional explosion.  That is, after it new plans are born, ideas, you are reviewing something - what did you do wrong, what others are doing, look, compare.  And thus you learn from the experience of others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/088/08c/bec/08808cbec9e0406d9078a291176fd185.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Organizing Committee: In what direction is ISDEF drifting now?</b>  <b>Do you consider this direction to be correct from the point of view of organization, approach to the selection of reports, admission of members.</b> <br><br>  <b>Pavel Kozlovsky:</b> For the last few years we have been holding ISDEF, and after each conference we meet on the organizing committee of the conference and the board of the conference (I am there and there).  We share our thoughts about what we did at the conference, what did not.  And almost always we agree that, in principle, by and large everything worked out, everything went well, everything we wanted to do was done, and we didn‚Äôt need to do anything new.  We are moving with the world and our life.  Everything that happens around us, we try to reflect, discuss at ISDEF.  In general, the plan is to support the conference in the interests of people, so that it develops further and flourishes. <br><br>  <b>Organizing committee: Your top speakers at the autumn conference ISDEF 2017?</b> <br><br>  <b>Pavel Kozlovsky:</b> I am always very interested (judging by the rating and the number of listeners) to listen to top managers who have achieved great results, were able to develop their company, move to a new level.  Listening to people who have succeeded in something, they can gain experience and, in principle, these are interesting speakers.  There are Alexander Lyskovsky, Sergey Ryzhikov and others. Dima Kalaev tells very interestingly.  I'm interested in everything.  Since I am a leader in my small company, I am interested in all the topics - superficially, without going deep, to meet and be aware of everything.  That is, it is difficult to isolate something concrete.  The only thing that distinguishes me from many ISDEF members is that my clients in the B2C segment work, that is, everything is turned to consumer issues.  And I have 95% of the market - this is Russia, not abroad, that is, I am more interested in the development of the market and marketing in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/efc/3e7/7f5/efc3e77f56944e8ab928eac92672bcf2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>PS:</b> Our annual autumn <a href="http://2017.isdef.org/">conference ISDEF 2017</a> will be held September 29-30 in Vinogradovo (this is Moscow, but a kilometer from Dolgoprudny outside Moscow) and traditionally gather 150-250 participants from different IT business niches (100 participants are now registered, but 30-50 ISDEF members are usually registered before the conference itself, taking advantage of their participation privileges, so we expect comfortable ‚Äúattendance‚Äù of 150-200 people).  And all this in a cozy ‚Äútube‚Äù atmosphere without pathos and excesses. <br><br>  <b>PPS:</b> Today, September 11, is the last day when you can register at a discount of 12,000 rubles or $ 200, the price without a discount will be $ 300 (18,000 rubles), and registration will be closed after 2 weeks, September 25.  <a href="http://2017.isdef.org/">Look at all the speakers</a> and make a decision, but our advice: <a href="http://www.isdef.org/ru/conference/isdef2017/members.php%3FISDEF_ID%3Disdef_2017">you need to look at all registered</a> ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337458/</a></p>
