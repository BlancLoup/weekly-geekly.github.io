      When we overcome such formally significant-long procedures as holding a tender and concluding an agreement, we find ourselves in a waiting position with a low degree of predictability - no one is ready to work on the terms of supply of resources on demand. <br>  And after the team is assembled, we are faced with the difficulties of immersing employees of an external vendor in our everyday life and ceremonies.  In the ESF program, all teams work in Agile; therefore, at the stage of the inclusion of new participants, inevitably there arises a process of coordinating the conditions for joint development. <br><br>  We will not even write about all the charms of organizing access to super reliable and strictly confidential technological circuits. <br><br>  So we ask ourselves: is there a solution that will allow attracting competent developers in the right quantity in a short time? <br><br>  Wondered on the topic of freelance, will this be a solution to the resource problem for us? <br>  90% of our team are pessimistic in the responses and here are their arguments: <br><br><ol><li>  The complexity of the organization of access to the technological circuit for the developer - access is provided only if there is an official contract with the coordination of the security service; <br><br></li><li>  To conclude a contract, any counterparty, who in this case is also a freelance developer, must complete the competitive task and confirm his competence.  And only this way, reviews and ratings on a known resource are not a legal basis for entering into contractual relations. <br><br></li><li>  Remuneration for honest work is taxable. <br></li></ol><br>  Sounds serious, right? <br><br>  Freelance - the developer will probably find it easier to carry out small one-time orders with cash on delivery. <br><br>  What do you think? <br><br>  In search of a solution, we turned to foreign experience - the Gigsters service, with the help of which companies can order the implementation of software and applications. <br>  Service developed as a startup, in 2015.  received a large amount of investment from a large fund. <br>  Gigsters toolkit simplifies the task of the customer as much as possible - just send your tech.  assigning or voicing a problem in a chat with a personal manager so that in a short time you can receive a proposal for implementation with the calculation of cost and time. <br>  Perhaps the only inconvenience in communications is a significant difference in time zones. <br><br>  The resource potential of Gigsters is estimated at more than 1000 highly qualified specialists from different countries - developers, designers and business analysts, who, as can be read in open sources, undergo a high dropout rate before they get to work in the project.  It is important that these are not full-time employees, but specialists from different countries united by the idea, for some of which the resource is not the main place of work. <br><br>  Interestingly, in our country, apply this experience, maybe you took part in similar initiatives? <br><br>  Let's discuss this topic in the comments, are freelance ready to unite - are the developers or the practice of a long-term contract with a large corporation most comfortable for a free artist code? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325576/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325576/</a></p>
