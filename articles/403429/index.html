For example, if Mi had not invested in Ihealth, then there would be no Xiaomi smart blood pressure monitors.  And if it were not for a partnership with Philips, we would not see a smart desk lamp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09d/36f/6a1/09d36f6a1a374568a7870129edc968ba.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company Xiaomi is gradually increasing the range of reasonable, kind, "light".  Currently, there are two types of Wi-fi light bulbs with E27 ( <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/yeelight-smart-led.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dxiaomi%26utm_campaign%3Dwhite">white</a> and <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/xiaomi-yeelight-smart-led.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dxiaomi%26utm_campaign%3Dyeelight">color</a> ), a <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/xiaomi-yeelight-smart.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dxiaomi%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartled">bedside</a> lamp and two desktop ones.  One of which is the so-called <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/xiaomi-philips-eyecare-smart-lamp-2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dxiaomi%26utm_campaign%3Dphilips">Xiaomi Philips EyeCare</a> . <br><br>  Its main advantage is that it shines carefully and does not damage the vision.  On the Internet, its capabilities have been repeatedly demonstrated, pulsations have been compared, so it would not be very honest to post <a href="https://mysku.ru/blog/china-stores/45001.html">screenshots of others</a> .

      We only briefly recall how Xiaomi Philips EyeCare works. <br><br>  <b>A few words about packaging</b> <br><br>  Unlike most Xiaomi gadgets, the lamp box is not white.  Plain cardboard with printed logos, and the brand is ‚ÄúMijia‚Äù, which can mislead inexperienced fans who do not follow all labels Xiaomi works with. <br><br>  <b>A few words about the lamp</b> <br><br>  The lamp itself is white, like many Xiaomi smart home devices.  In total, in addition to the box, there is an instruction manual in Chinese and an adapter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e28/d46/755/e28d467556b649d19c7105dc027c14e8.JPG"><br><br>  He certainly has a non-standard plug.  <b>Included adapter - no</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c93/611/2af/c936112aff1f441788fd5070ce18dc0a.JPG"><br><br>  However, there is no mention of ‚ÄúMi‚Äù on the case, but the lamp is three times labeled ‚ÄúPhilips‚Äù: once on the stand, once on the adapter and once from the end, at the end of the lamp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f60/744/fef/f60744fef7b949889e7dd7c5f2c84c85.JPG"><br><br>  The adapter is connected from the back of the stand.  In the same place, to the side of it - the Wi-fi indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b8/77d/072/2b877d0723224e6fbd0bd3b000b00698.JPG"><br><br>  If you plan to use the lamp without connecting to the network, then after a while the light will stop flashing.  As with most Wi-fi devices, network search is red, network connection is blue. <br><br>  You can really control the lamp without synchronization with Mi Home.  The main panel is on the stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/235/7d1/202/2357d1202b7e40359e5fc852bb41c8b4.JPG"><br><br>  First button: on / off.  Then there is a button to turn on the rear additional lamp.  Several points in a row - this is the brightness adjustment.  The ‚Äúeye‚Äù icon is a button to activate the light sensor, which is located above the buttons.  Using this sensor, the device itself analyzes the level of light in the room and adapts the comfortable brightness. <br><br>  The position of the lamp is adjusted manually.  Two lamps (on the head and on the leg) are divided by a flexible insert. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3f/872/e2b/b3f872e2bb144d4e9f38bcc61c0d799d.jpg"><br><br>  Realizing that it is impossible to adjust the lamp once and for all, the manufacturer promises up to 10,000 bends without damage to the structure!  Luminaire, as already mentioned, two.  One is located on the head of the lamp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/593/d27/075/593d270750da44ca9785f400bdaa4761.JPG"><br><br>  The second on the leg.  From the back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74b/9b9/de5/74b9b9de5b694ac6bc31d9234195057d.JPG"><br><br>  This allows several usage scenarios.  For example, when one overhead light is on, when both are on.  Or, which is already regulated by turning the lamp, the main one is shining upwards, and the main one is becoming side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/522/57a/c95/52257ac95fbf41fbae83d862eebd868f.jpg"><br><br>  Side, or rear, light is turned off.  And the lamp can only give light from the head.  But the reverse is not provided.  The only thing that you can: send it up and maximally muffle manually or through the application. <br><br>  Also, the remote side lights off is not provided, but the lamp will remember your choice on the panel.  If at the last inclusion both burned, then the application will light both lamps, if one - then, therefore, one, the top one. <br><br>  <b>application</b> <br><br>  Some additional features can be activated in the app.  It also allows you to remotely turn on and off the gadget and control the brightness.  If you have installed Mi Home, then when you turn on the lamp will find itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b7/83f/b6a/4b783fb6a4dd4cba8f56cb9195abce5e.jpg"><br><br>  Also, as in the case of <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/obzory/obzorxiaomiyeelight.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dxiaomi%26utm_campaign%3Dyeelight">Yeelight</a> , an additional plugin will be loaded.  The connection process is fast: the application determines your Wi-fi point, connects the lamp to this network and in the final allows you to specify the lamp location. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/106/763/d23/106763d236dd4a319dcb8ccd3205e6cb.jpg"><br><br>  The main menu consists of three items: on / off mode, eye protection mode and delayed shutdown.  The main difference between the brightness adjustment via the application from the manual mode: the ability to more flexibly adjust the lighting, up to one percent! <br><br>  The default eye protection mode is the brightest: ‚Äúchildish‚Äù.  In total, there are three: children / adult / mode of operation for a computer or tablet.  The delayed shutdown mode allows you to set a delay so that, for example, there is time to finish some work, leave the room, while the lamp itself goes out after a specified interval. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b5/600/2b3/4b56002b395c4daf9c89497a6a769e18.jpg"><br><br>  You can also set several individual usage scenarios by activating the corresponding features in the settings.  These features include a night light mode, setting notifications, and a rest reminder mode for the eyes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0f/2ca/247/d0f2ca247fec4ad2ad950576da283ffc.jpg"><br><br>  You can set timers, as well as activate notifications, for example, during an incoming call. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/069/b76/38c/069b7638c3614b8598d67addd034dcc3.jpg"><br><br>  The main feature of this lamp is considered "safe" for the eyes of the light, referred to in each mention.  The cost of <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/xiaomi-philips-eyecare-smart-lamp-2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dxiaomi%26utm_campaign%3Dpholips">Xiaomi Philips Eyecare Smart 3500 rubles</a> .  The manufacturer claims that such a lamp will work for more than 10 years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403429/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403429/</a></p>
