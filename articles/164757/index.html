  <section class="page js-page"><h1>'Elite: Dangerous' Sets a record as the most expensive project on Kickstarter, which successfully raised money for implementation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><habracut>  If you're from the 80s, congratulations, you're an old man.  If you were not in the 80s, then take a time machine and transfer to 1984 to play <i>Elite</i> .  It was an incredible game for that time, with an improved ship and an explored universe full of battles and commerce (although in the 3D monochrome framework of the frame), this is the great-grandfather of games like <i>Eve Online</i> ... as well as of any other space.  And thanks to the successful <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous%3Fref%3Dlive">Kickstarter</a> project, we will soon receive a sequel. <br><br>  David Braben, the founder of Frontier Developments, who co-authored the original game, asked the supporters for a huge amount of ¬£ 1.25 million (about $ 2.03 million) and recently received it.  Although this project is not a record holder for fees, this is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch)">Pebble smartwatch</a> that has collected more than $ 10 million ‚Äî according to a Kickstarter representative, this is the project with the highest price that has successfully raised money for implementation.  Several projects requested a large amount (one requested $ 3.5 million), but none of them was successfully funded. <br><br>  When I saw that Frontier Developments requested 2 million, my first reaction was ‚ÄúWHAT WHAT ?!‚Äù But moving away from the shock, I realized that it makes sense.  This is not a $ 10,000 startup.  Braben already has experience in the gaming industry, releasing titles such as <i>Kinect Disneyland Adventrues</i> with Frontier Developmets.  Braben wants to make a 21st century sequel to <i>Elite</i> who will be honored with this name: a high-quality product that will have the resources and people to support this ambitious project.

      Braben wrote on the Kickstarter page, <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI have long wanted the <i>Elite: Dangerous</i> game to be made by Frontier.  The next game in the Elite series is an incredible space with amazing effects, addictive gameplay and an exciting atmosphere, but now you can also play with your friends.  I want a game that feels like the original ‚ÄúElite‚Äù and with faster travels (this is for the multiplayer component of the game) - so you travel faster using local ‚Äúhyperspatial‚Äù paths than by rewinding time - but in the rich Frontier universe - and more, much more. <br>  I will be frank - we had several beginnings in this direction during these years that were not successful in my understanding.  And of course it is clear that other projects had higher priorities - projects with an announced release date or other commitments.  Until now, a small team has been working on ‚ÄûElite‚Äú which has been doing this for themselves and in their free time.  Nevertheless, we were preparing - laying the foundation for technology and design until better times.  And this time is now. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  Less than two days before the end, <i>Elite: Dangerous</i> set the bar: If funding exceeds 1.4 million pounds, Frontier will release a version for Mac;  after 1.5 million, Frontier will add 10 more gaming ships.  (The only playable ship in the original <i>Elite</i> was the Cobra MKIII. And although you could improve the lasers and hull, you couldn‚Äôt change the ship.) <br>  But whatever happens, space fans can start to warm up the engines. <br><br>  Note: For those interested in the name of the sequel, veterans know that ‚ÄúDangerous‚Äù is the sixth pilot rating.  Pilots had to go through the ranks from Harmless, Mostly Harmless, Poor, Average, Competent, Dangerous, Deadly and eventually Elite. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2013/01/03/elite-dangerous-sets-the-record-for-highest-kickstarter-goal-to-be-successfully-funded/">Original article on Forbes</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous%3Fref%3Dlive">Link to the game page on Kickstarter</a> <br><br>  PS At the time of this writing, the second level of funding was passed.  Congratulations to all makovodov. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164757/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164757/</a></p>
