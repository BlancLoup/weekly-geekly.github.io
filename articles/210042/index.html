  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Hello everyone in this chat" - my favorite response to the mass newsletter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About once a month, letters arrive with several hundred recipients.  During the holidays, they all gathered a whole stack.  Most often, these are holiday greetings or ‚Äúfarewell letters‚Äù of advertising agency managers.  The general meaning: "Hello friends, I am leaving for a new job, Vasya, he is for me." <br><br>  <b>The only burnout is that people simply merge their entire customer base</b> .  Well, of course, in farewell letters, this may be intentional, but ... <br><br>  In general, I always click on ‚ÄúAnswer all‚Äù and write like this:

Considering that usually in the addressees of the general director or tops, these are wholesale orders in the spirit of "and ship us 500 pieces for New Year's gifts."  For this - a special thank you to the employee who so warmly said goodbye to us, presenting customers.  He, in fact, did not plan it, but helped. <br><br>  <b>Secondly, the keyword "chat"</b> .  Always, always there is a person who understands nothing and writes ‚ÄúPlease remove me from the mailing list‚Äù.  And then the chain reaction will begin - every second person in the copy will write the same thing.  From the tenth letter it is necessary to indicate to whom to write (the initiator of the mailing), otherwise the rest will fill up the boxes.  It's crazy fun, but inhumane.  Ten letters would be enough for a person to understand for a lifetime how the mail works. <br><br><h4>  Is it a pity to me the employee who zhahnul such a newsletter? </h4><br>  In general - no, because it merges my mail in conjunction with the name of someone.  Some are offended, some save face and say something like ‚ÄúOriginal move, well done!‚Äù.  And they don't do that anymore.  At least exclude me from the copy. <br><br>  Thirdly, sometimes the recipients do not understand that the letters to 500 recipients, and believe that this is something like a personal dialogue.  And they begin to tell why they need games.  I had a precedent when one of the tops of the restaurant chain, right in an open letter, explained that the main task was for people to quickly eat and leave.  It seems like this, and so everyone understands, but when you openly write about it, it is not very beautiful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e9/70d/894/7e970d8948065598652669ce830a6123.png" alt="image"><br>  <sup>That's how the dialogue began</sup> <br><br><h4>  Strike! </h4><br>  <b>The easiest way to send correctly is to ‚ÄúTo‚Äù, all the rest to a hidden copy.</b>  More complex and intelligent - for each letter, it is very correct.  If, after all, it is just necessary to send the newsletter - through the services of sending newsletters to a separate list: there will be a link to the auto-reply at the end. <br><br>  The coolest case was when a person for the first time, when moving from one advertising agency to another, stepped on this rake.  And, taking into account the previous experience, sent a second newsletter smarter.  There were three mailboxes in the requisites - I, he himself was in Reply-To, but the letter came from a certain group@mydomain.ru. <br><br>  I took and sent there my "Hello everyone in this chat."  And you know what?  The letter immediately arrived again in the mailing list.  That is, for some strange whim they just made a box that had a chain of forwards on the list of customers.  And they did not think that anyone could look at the details of the letter and send theirs there.  Imagine: you have already ‚Äúburned‚Äù so the list of clients of one agency, understood everything, told your IT specialists how not to send them, they rolled you a solution ... and you ‚Äúleaked‚Äù the list of clients of the second agency.  Why?  Because the delivery notes, which I was not too lazy to stick to the letter, were also sent to me.  And at the same time - to all participants of the correspondence, apparently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07b/37d/f46/07b37df4653b282a7e0ac035eb286a5d.png" alt="image"><br>  <sup>Another example</sup> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/121/de4/51f/121de451fc9d82b7a0aeb07b392913bf.png" alt="image"><br>  <sup>And this is completely wild: look at the attachments</sup> <br><br><h4>  At last </h4><br>  In general, take care of your customer base and think about how to send.  You are welcome.  Yes, and tell your managers about this, otherwise while you are reading a topic here, they can already do something like this in banal ignorance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210042/</a></p>
