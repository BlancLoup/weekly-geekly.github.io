  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"The right driver." Project Diary. Part 1.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About how the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project "The <a href="http://www.60.by/">correct driver</a> " was born, I wrote in a previous post.  Now I want to tell you step by step how the idea came to life.  It will be a kind of development diary of the project, in which I will tell you how I did, what exactly and why. <br><br>  And also about the experiments on the project.  And together we will see what will come out of these ploys.  I hope this ‚Äúlive show‚Äù will be interesting and informative.  So‚Ä¶ <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  From the moment the idea was realized, a little more than three weeks passed before the official launch.  The speed and simplicity of realization was inspired by the well-known book 37signals <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a> (by the way, I strongly recommend that you read it to everyone).

      Evaluation of the relevance of the future project took place as follows: I am a normal, sane person, like me - the majority.  So, if the project will be useful to me, then it will be useful to many.  Therefore: attendance, monetization, blah blah blah ... The basis of this chain is the self-esteem of my normality, it‚Äôs important not to make a mistake here :) We‚Äôll see if I‚Äôm right or wrong. <br><br>  First of all, I wrote down on paper why this project is being developed, what ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù functions it will perform.  Prescribed the structure of the content part.  And the boot is clear that it is absolutely important and critical for the project - its content.  "Copy-paste" you will not manage - time will be spent in vain.  Content must be copyright and unique. <br><br>  Then, I thought about how to make money on a project.  The final dock showed several distinguished friends.  Their opinion means a lot to me and, having received their worthy assessment of the future project and approval, issued the first document.  Document for potential sponsors.  It was not difficult to calculate them, and the next day I began to make phone calls and a detour.  Due to the crisis, Minsk car dealers, besides a decent assessment of the future resource, complained about the lack of a budget for image promotion (there is no website, therefore there is no attendance yet, therefore you can only talk about image).  Having distributed a dozen documents, I realized that the idea had already gone "to the people" and "slow down", I have no right. <br><br>  I visited the Minsk traffic police, spoke about the project and ... Oh, a miracle!  I got acquainted with the ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù (in a good way) traffic cop, who writes author articles, flashes on TV, and publishes in the press with author columns and develops his ‚ÄúEmergency Theory‚Äù.  A real enthusiast of safe traffic.  What I managed to find with him a common language, I considered an excellent omen. <br><br>  I did not have to invent a situation, I come across them several times a day.  The idea to disassemble them on the opposition of my emotional evaluation and a weighted expert, came up with my father during the trip.  I once again made a provocation of another ‚Äúhandsome man,‚Äù and my father laid out the situation from a different point of view. <br><br>  In the following posts I will talk about: <br><br>  Website development, my financial and time costs. <br>  The initial promotion.  What has been done and what happened. <br>  And about the first money earned on the project! <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54966/</a></p>
