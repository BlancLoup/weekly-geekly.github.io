  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to remember a large amount of information in a short period of time</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many people, whose activity is connected with large volumes of information, are wondering - is it possible to remember a large amount of data in a small amount of time?  The answer is yes, and for this you need to remember only a few simple rules. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The process of memorization is divided into two types: voluntary and involuntary. <br>  Arbitrary memorization in turn is divided into mechanical (cramming) and logical (comprehension). <br><br>  It is important to understand that the memorized material will remain in your memory for a relatively short time, while understood and deeply meaningful will not leave you for many years.  In addition, with the participation of logic in the process of memorization, the quality and quantity of the learned increases several times.  And it will take much less time to work with the logical part of consciousness, because it is enough just to remember the beginning, everything else will line up in a chain. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll this, of course, is good,‚Äù you say, but what if the information does not want to be understood in any way? There is a universal way.  Retell all the material that you do not understand to your brother / cester / dog / bystander, but to anyone.  In such situations, your brain involuntarily begins to look for simpler formulations of complex concepts; you will begin to express your thoughts easily and naturally.  And all that was difficult and intricately will be easier steamed turnips.

      The next secret is the entry.  Write, write and write again.  Everything that you outline on paper will be remembered many times faster. <br><br>  The best time to learn something new is from 8 to 10 am and from 8 to 11 pm.  At this time, most people's brains are most active. <br><br>  It is extremely important to gather all the will into a fist, concentrate, and not allow anything to take you out of this state.  It is easier to find a room where no one will look for you than to start learning anew each time, after you are once again distracted.  Do not try to shove a huge amount of information into your brain right away, all the same, nothing will come of it.  It is much better to break the material into parts and teach them one by one, with a few interruptions. <br><br>  Also define for yourself the shelf life of the studied.  If you only teach everything for the exam on Wednesday, that on Thursday you can hardly remember what.  But if you decide that the material is necessary, interesting and may well come in handy later - you will remember it for a long time. <br><br>  Do not forget about repetitions.  The first time - in forty minutes, the second - in a day, and so on in descending order. <br><br>  Regardless of the state of your memory, tell everyone that it is wonderful, almost phenomenal.  Thereby you will give your subconscious a stimulus, and it will know what to strive for. <br><br>  Successful study! <br><br>  PS In general, the surest way to memorize, for example, a lecture is to buy a voice recorder :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72528/</a></p>
