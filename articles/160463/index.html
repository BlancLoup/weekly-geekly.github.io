  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Industrial Internet can add 15 trillion dollars to global GDP</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now the phrase "Internet of Things" is heard - a network of wireless intelligent devices, so tiny and economical that they can be embedded in almost any object that surrounds us, making them more convenient and useful.  ‚ÄúIndustrial Internet‚Äù is the same Internet of things, but not in everyday life, but in production - a network of sensors and intelligent systems, uniting machines, units, power plants, locomotives, airplanes - the industrial foundation of our civilization. <br><br>  General Electric believes that we are on the verge of a new wave of innovations, which will be based on the combination of the achievements of the industrial and information revolution.  Until now, the Internet has primarily influenced the consumer market, the financial sector and the service economy.  All these smartphones, web services, applications and content entertained and surprised us, but did not have a significant impact on productivity growth (why not Ray Ray Bradbury's phrase about the fact that humanity exchanged the opportunity to surf the space for meaningless consumption!) <br><br>  GE's Industrial Internet: Pushing the Prospects for the Industrial Internet gives the hope that the entertainment, consumer character of the Internet is just a childhood illness, and soon the global network will give a tangible impetus to global industry.  ‚ÄúThe industrial revolution lasted for more than 150 years, and some of the most important innovations were embodied closer to its completion.  Even if we consider the beginning of the Internet revolution of the 1950s, it is too early to say that it will not be able to give a long-term economic effect, ‚Äùthe authors of the report write. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to specialists of General Electric, the industrial Internet today can find application in sectors of the economy, in the amount of creating 32.3 trillion dollars of world GDP.  By 2025, this figure will be 82 trillion.  The widespread introduction of the industrial Internet will be able to give an increase in global GDP of 10 to 15 trillion dollars in 20 years.

      Take, for example, aviation.  Sensors installed in aircraft engines will broadcast real-time engine performance data, and analytical systems based on artificial intelligence algorithms will select the optimal mode ‚Äî and such information from all airplanes will flow into a single system for subsequent analysis and improvement of algorithms.  The movement of all aircraft, the work of airports will also be optimized as a whole, and moreover - integration with other transport systems, with sea, rail and urban public transport is possible. <br><br>  Saving only one percent of aviation fuel thanks to these measures will save us $ 30 billion over 15 years.  Similar results can be achieved in rail transport, energy, manufacturing, medicine. <br><br>  Itself General Electric expects to get in those industries in which it works, the economic effect of up to 150 billion dollars from the introduction of the industrial Internet.  Some projects are already running.  For example, the company First Wind, which is engaged in wind power plants, is actively experimenting with an increase in the number of wind turbine sensors and the quality of processing the information received from them.  Sensors on new turbines collect three to five times more useful information than a few years ago.  The upgrade of 123 wind turbines at two power plants has already allowed an increase in electricity production by 3%. <br><br>  Mount Sinai Medical Center is implementing a project to optimize the operation of the hospital for 1,100 beds in New York.  Patients receive plastic bracelets with location sensors and other sensors, similar devices are provided with beds and medical equipment.  All data is flocked to the hospital computer network and is used to optimize the admission and placement of patients, the loading of diagnostic and therapeutic equipment.  The management of the medical center expects that thanks to such an information system, the hospital will be able to serve 10,000 patients a year more. <br><br>  At the heart of these industrial projects are the same technologies and protocols, the same hardware and software that is used in the usual, ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù Internet.  Starting as a research project, the Internet then attracted hacker enthusiasts, and finally, a mass user, becoming a place for games, shopping and sharing photos of cats.  Perhaps this is not the end of his evolution, but only a prelude to something more? <br><br>  Full report ( <a href="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ge-industrial-internet-vision-paper.pdf">PDF</a> ). <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/technology/internet/ge-looks-to-industry-for-the-next-digital-disruption.html%3Fpagewanted%3D2%26_r%3D0">New York Times</a> . <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160463/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160463/</a></p>
