We are located in St. Petersburg and are developing applications for mobile phones, and sometimes even small research (as an interesting and useful hobby for increasing universal karma). <br><br>  We hope that we will fit into the Habr format and will be able to talk about things that will be of interest to you, namely: <br><ul><li>  as we searched and did not find the investment; </li><li>  how we created our startup for several years - the Wapalta project; </li><li>  how Wapalta became a top seller; </li><li>  what else have we come up with and how will we develop this together with you. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We created the first company in 2002, and under the ‚Äúbrand‚Äù of Generatum Software we began to develop since 2006.  In 2008, we created an independent legal entity, within which we work to this day.  It so happened that we were looking for a long time, but could not find investments for our ideas and projects, so we had to tighten our belts and implement them ourselves.  Then I had to tighten my belt even tighter, and then another ... <br>  And then it seemed that something would turn out ...

      Habr√© often discusses investment and start-ups.  We would like to tell you about our work experience.  Perhaps someone it will be interesting and useful.  In exchange, we would like to hear comments, criticism, ideas and suggestions on our projects. <br><br>  In 2006, we began work on the <a href="http://wapalta.ru/">Wapalta</a> project - a simple and convenient client-server J2ME application for correspondence and receiving any information from the mobile Internet.  In 2007, they released the first version of the market, hoping to make money on advertising.  In 2008, they began to win various contests, but there was little use for them. <br>  Throughout 2008, we spent communicating with business angels and venture capital investors of various sizes, as well as with people who for some reason called themselves investors.  The result was zero. <br><br>  Realizing that this can no longer continue, we completely stopped any external contacts with someone, killed all the old designs and did everything again.  In February 2009, our Wapalta app was already released by the top content providers, and we, inspired by the first positive result, continued to work. <br><br>  Now, at the end of 2009, Wapalta has more than 500,000 users, mostly from Russia.  This summer we started to integrate users of the application into a mobile social network, and this also turned out to be very interesting. <br><br>  Now we are continuing <a href="http://blog.wapalta.com/">to develop Wapalta</a> (just recently, a new version of the application will be released) and are preparing new interesting projects in the field of mobile Internet.  Here, on Habr√©, we are ready to talk about the specifics of the search for investments, about the monetization of the service, about the ideas of building a mobile interface, about the development of the community in our mobile social network. <br><br>  So I ask you in the comments to express your opinion that it will be interesting for you to read in the following posts.  I hope everyone will be interested!  ;) <br><br>  <strong><em>Igor Rodionov</em></strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78259/</a></p>
