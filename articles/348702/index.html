      Until February 20, we accept applications for reports, and until February 15, you can buy tickets at the lowest price.  Under the cut all the details. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <b>Program committee</b> </h3><br>  Program directors invite iconic speakers, look at the applications, select the most useful and interesting ones, help the speakers prepare, arrange rehearsals for the performances and do everything possible to make a great program. <br><br>  In the program committee, we are always cool people in their fields. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The FrontTalks section is done by frontline titans - <b>Oleg Mokhov</b> (Yandex), <b>Vadim Makishvili</b> (Yandex) and <b>Alexey Ivanov</b> (Evil Martians). <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Serverside is being prepared this year: <b>Alexey Spiridonov</b> , JetStyle technical director, Daniil Skrobov, head of development at Vostok projects, <b>Oleg Khromov</b> , director of Tinkoff Development Center in Yekaterinburg, <b>Konstantin Beklemishev</b> , head of Naumen Contact Center development software, Contur. Accounting software at SKB Kontur <b>Yury Pliner</b> . <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ A section for mobile developers is being done by an iOS developer at the Tochka bank, <b>Maxim Keegan</b> , author of ETransport, Senior Android developer at SKBLab, <b>Maxim Rovkin,</b> and GDG founder in Yekaterinburg <b>Rodion Revin</b> . <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In the DevOps section, the main ones this year are <b>Alexander Tarasov</b> , an engineer from Odnoklassniki, and <b>Andrey Fefelov,</b> director of Mastery.pro. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Design reports are again being prepared by Acronis Design Team Leader <b>Alexander Kudymov</b> and Ridero art director <b>Daria Prokuda</b> . <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The Testing section is made by a cool team of Ekaterinburg testers: testing specialist at SKB Kontur and one of the founders of the Ural testing community of the Urals <b>Anastasia Ronzhina</b> , activist of the Urals testing community, Junior speaker <b>Yevgeny Sabirov</b> (GK HOST), developer of the test automation system at Naumen <b>Yevgenia Azanova</b> and hereditary cashier software tester <b>Dmitry Yakin</b> (SKB Kontur). <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Reports for managers, team leaders and directors of IT companies are being prepared by the director at E9 Laboratory <b>Alexander Karabasov</b> and the managing director of IT services development at UBRD <b>Denis Onishchenko</b> . <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Major on science at DAMP-e - <b>Alexey Kirpichnikov</b> (SKB Kontur) and <b>Viktor Grishchenko</b> (realm.io). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l0/pm/bh/l0pmbhrfkt8y0g-_j0wxqrp4f2e.jpeg"><br>  <i>Science section participants at DUMP-2017</i> <br><br><h3>  <b>I want to speak at DUMP-2018</b> </h3><br>  Program directors described topics that are of interest to us.  If you have something to say on one of the topics below and you want to speak, <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/">write to</a> us.  Any format is possible: sectional report (40 min), blitz report (10-20 minutes), master class.  Applications are accepted until February 20. <br><br><h4>  <b>Serverside</b> </h4><br>  The main difference between the Serverside 2018 section and other sections of DAMP is a practical, applied focus.  The fact that three years ago it was at the forefront of science is already being used in production inside the standard library. <br><br>  Of course, this year, as always, we will consider and discuss all applications.  Best practices, correct architectures, success stories about technological solutions on the backend are always relevant.  But especially we will be happy with reports about ‚ÄúHipovy technologies in everyday life‚Äù. <br><br>  If you know how to prepare a blockchain and machine-programming, write on go and scala, use IoT solutions (and all this in commercial projects), know firsthand about the vulnerabilities of processes and software and can explain how this knowledge will be useful to the developer in real life, rather write .  We are waiting and looking for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n2/79/ib/n279ibo6gq35c_p11ukacjwdmyq.jpeg"><br>  <i>Last year, Andrei Akinshin <a href="https://youtu.be/raJ-yhkH9MY">talked</a> about cross-platform .NET, its capabilities and impossibilities at the moment</i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Science</b> </h4><br>  In 2018, we want to consolidate the success of the Science section, which returned triumphant last year! <br><br>  This time we want to expand the halls of the mind, go beyond math and computer science and try to look into the future. <br><br>  We want reports: <br><br><ol><li>  From the field of exact sciences. </li><li>  Understandable without special education, but not too simple.  I would be guided by the level of graduates of IEN USU (or as it is now called).  The more complex things can be explained in plain language, the steeper. </li><li>  Or dedicated to practical topics that will change our lives in the next 10-20 years, or dedicated to breakthroughs in some fundamental areas.  As an exception, we consider local successes (if this is the personal experience of the speaker), and the speaker knows how to tell about him. </li><li>  The speaker should at least have a specialized education and / or experience in the relevant field.  Personal contribution to the breakthrough is not required, we do not expect the arrival of the Nobel laureates :) </li></ol><br>  The main requirement for speakers in our section is constant: the ability to explain complex things in a clear language.  We will discuss the topic of the report - the main thing is that your eyes are burning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z5/1w/3o/z51w3ofru35udyjvx_iwcjhe7pa.jpeg"><br>  <i>At last year‚Äôs section, Grigory Bakunov <a href="https://youtu.be/59qXrpq2hhQ">explained</a> what modern artificial intelligence is and explained why it‚Äôs important to start teaching AI now</i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Fronttalks</b> </h4><br>  We have not had time to write what topics are interesting to us, and in the section on the frontend we have the most applications, so we will have a difficult choice.  But if you have something to tell you about front-end development, write, suddenly your application will be the most interesting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5f/r6/eu/5fr6euzsnnjc88ksw53wfph5cl4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Nikita Prokopov <a href="https://youtu.be/m-siXL-mbbE">told</a> in last year‚Äôs section how a new generation of client-server communication can be done: advanced data models, high-level APIs, event logs, etc.</i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Devops</b> </h4><br>  Section DevOps this year will be held for the third time.  We do not want to limit ourselves to one common topic for reports, so we‚Äôll talk about the different sides of the devops technology.  Traditionally, the section will be devoted exclusively to technical reports.  No ads, just hardcore. <br><br>  We want reports about: <br><br><ol><li>  how different teams deal with issues related to CI, CD, when it comes to, for example, large development teams, a large number of features, high speed from setting to release, in general, when there is a word ‚Äúbig‚Äù :) </li><li>  security; </li><li>  orchestration; </li><li>  business cases: who introduced what and what came out of it; </li><li>  monitoring. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sn/dw/uh/sndwuhimiyuwzrc3eaphiimim5u.jpeg"><br>  <i>Last year Site Reliability Engineer at Dropbox Leonid Vasilyev <a href="https://youtu.be/3wVPPE1urCc">told</a> how, from the point of view of SRE, Dropbox implemented the foundation of a stable infrastructure, what technologies are used in Dropbox and what difficulties it faces.</i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Mobile</b> </h4><br>  This year we will try to make the section interesting on all fronts - Android and iOS, Kotlin and Swift, security and testing.  For dessert - a little iOT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/3t/tt/kq3tttvik9-gdpyyrbni6bp34yu.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Management</b> </h4><br>  This year we are waiting for reports on project management, evaluation of developers and their search, development in banks, launch of their projects.  In general, you can apply for reports on any topic, the best presentation is that which breaks out of your soul, that excites and inspires the speaker himself.  We especially invite Ural speakers! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/63/cp/yp/63cpypiem-y_w2lycittdnkzzyo.jpeg"><br>  <i>One of the best reports of the past year - <a href="https://youtu.be/I6OIK-UMFtg">‚ÄúProfessional burnout of the project manager‚Äù</a> by Alexander Orlov</i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Testing</b> </h4><br>  This time we will talk (suddenly) about testers.  Who is a tester in 2018?  What are his areas of responsibility?  What tasks can be set for him, and which ones are not?  Answers to all these questions will help us create a collective image of a new superhero - the Man-Tester. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/le/f0/eq/lef0eq6wu-_x3pc-00t8pzqs3ua.jpeg"><br>  <i>The author of the portal Testbase.ru, Olga Nazina, after <a href="https://youtu.be/sXn_-Ix_l7Y">speaking</a> at DAMP-2017, wrote a <a href="http://okiseleva.blogspot.ru/2017/04/dump-2017.html">detailed review</a> of the conference as a whole and the role of the speaker</i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Design</b> </h4><br>  In the Design section this year, we want to collect reports on the main topics that the designers discussed last year and continue to discuss this year.  We are looking for speakers who will help to understand the topic, who are willing to share experiences and mistakes. <br><br>  Topics that interest us: <br><br><ol><li>  Design systems.  The most sensational theme of 2017.  We are interested in the experience of companies that have created and implemented their own design system: why it is needed, how everything went, results, conclusions, mistakes - that‚Äôs all. </li><li>  UX Writers.  Google, Amazon, Dropbox, Paypal are looking for ux-writers.  In the Russian market, this still seems to be a fad, but it is quite possible that soon ux-writers will become part of our life.  Who are ux-writers?  Does the designer need to learn to work with the text or should a special person do it?  If so, how does a ux-writer differ from a copywriter? </li><li>  Branding  Here we do not mean creating a logo for a company, but branding as part of a business, city or country. </li><li>  AR VR.  The introduction and non-trivial use in everyday reality. </li><li>  Design and analytics.  How can a designer use analytics to make decisions?  Where to get the data?  What questions to ask analytics? </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3x/zg/2w/3xzg2wdas3fvqhbjf2e34alyk6i.jpeg"><br>  <i>The head of the interface design and design department at Mail.Ru Group, the author of the beloved <a href="http://jvetrau.com/">‚ÄúProduct Design Digest‚Äù,</a> Yuri Vetrov, last year <a href="https://youtu.be/CjzSCrZMHbQ">gave a step-by-step checklist of</a> changes in the design team processes and the company as a whole</i> <br><br>  If you have not seen any topic in the list, but want to speak with her, <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/">please contact us</a> anyway.  Perhaps the program committee will decide that the report will be super-useful and include it in the program. <br><br><h4>  <b>I want to become a sponsor</b> </h4><br>  Sponsorship of the conference is not only a contribution to the development of the it-community in Yekaterinburg, but also an opportunity to promote your company or product to an audience of developers, designers, testers, team leaders, and development department heads.
