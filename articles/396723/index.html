And even he will meet guests in a special way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ed/6df/db2/0ed6dfdb25ea4a93a38caa269b6ef956.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, its functionality goes far beyond simple protection against autopsy - it is also a complex of safe entrance and exit of residents; nevertheless, property is not so important for the owner as the life of the owner himself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And now let's see if we can answer for all these phrases in a fit of feeling.  And it will not be about a particular castle, but about a combination of technology that is gradually coming to the private sector, albeit as slowly as everything advanced in our country.  Just say, <b>this is not expensive, but quite a budget option</b> - well, in the sense that 15 thousand more people can spend for the safe entrance of their homes.  Given that, for some reason, she had already spent more on the steel door.  Why "for some reason"?  - Because these <b>doors with regular locks open in a few minutes</b> .  How?  - Yes, at least like this:

Electron-mechanical with a mask for a key is a sort of lock on the lock for those who are drawn to electronics, but are not yet ready to believe it completely.  We will try to prove that some samples of today's technologies need to be trusted.  We‚Äôll prove not with some handouts, but we‚Äôll sort through every detail, every question you could ask - we hear them every day, and the frank answers are all here! <br><br>  Moreover, there is no such thing in the Spetszamka.  It protects not at the expense of some complicated mechanics; to the already well-known technologies, they added small simple (all ingeniously simple) tricks that turned it all together into an inaccessible logical connection, meticulously taking into account criminal impulses of any nature.  So, today we will tell about the inexpensive device of one of our partners - the multivariate video lock with the access control system ‚ÄúSpecial Lock‚Äù, and in the end we will explain what we are talking about.  And now we will prove the above said (most importantly, do not forget that the main goal of the topic is at the end). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b6/c0d/71f/0b6c0d71f4944db58056a7be63bff3bd.jpg"><br><br>  Well, we get rid of the first one quickly, this electronic-mechanical lock stupidly <b>does not have a mask, therefore there is no place to stick the ‚Äúkeys‚Äù</b> .  But grind cut out all the same possible.  But only if found.  Where he stands is also unknown, the installation location varies around the perimeter of the door.  It can be embedded both up and down, and even from different sides.  In addition, it is <b>allowed (and recommended) to install several such locks at once, which can be opened one by one</b> .  In fact, it is necessary to cut the whole door, not the lock, so the second statement is more likely true. <br><br>  The problem with most electro-mechanical locks is a quick failure.  A hard latch hits the box hard, gradually knocking out its own mount and tilting the door.  This lock does not have such a latch and no force at all in the structure.  When the door closes, the closing sensor is activated, and the steel bolt freely enters its own box, without causing damage to the mechanisms.  We immediately add here that <b>such a locking-unlocking option is also silent</b> . <br><br>  Although it was not the biggest problem of most electromechanical, their main ambush - in strength.  They will not leave the apartment, you have to lock the more serious locks.  A spetszamok - strong as a titanium, holds 800 kg of effort.  Its modifications presuppose an invoice variant, where 400 kg is kept on a passport, but it must be understood that the loose pieces depend not on themselves, but on the platform to which they are attached.  That selection of devices, which in the compartment is called ‚ÄúSpetszamkom‚Äù, comes only with a mortise version, in which <b>all 800 kg of power are its natural forces</b> .  To whom even this seemed not enough, the relics can be doubled, tripled and even quadrupled by installing additional devices - the amount is unlimited, the price for each is 7,000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aea/26a/da9/aea26ada977047ec852bed510c7b98f1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Non-standard installation locations are another big plus of this type of locks</b> : difficult to find, difficult to crawl (especially at the top), to open for a long time.  The standard lock with vertical bolts, although it locks at three points, but also unlocks them all at once with one movement of the screwdriver in the locking part at the level of the mask.  And several independent locks on mechanics need to be processed - each separately. <br><br>  But all this was a stupid mechanic, in itself it is only the power supply of a comprehensive system of entrance protection.  Yes, <b>this "constipation" of those that mechanical tools for a reasonable time can not take</b> .  But the weak point of any lock is his key, be it at least mechanical, even electronic.  From the existing access control tools, the developer chose one and seemingly frivolous - kodo-dial pad.  Although it is allowed to connect magnetic tags - the design allows it.  But a tag, like any key, can be stolen or with an effort to take away from the owner, which cannot be said about <b>the access code - you will not lose it, you will not steal it, you will not make a duplicate, you just will not take it away</b> . <br><br>  No, of course, after a couple of blows to the stomach, the owner himself will discover everything, but options are already possible here ... First, a robbery is a less common crime than theft, hundreds of times.  Secondly, one of the numerals of the code-dial pad serves as a ‚ÄúDanger‚Äù signal.  You say: Eka Nepal, all expensive ACSs come with a double code, one of which is ‚Äúforced entry‚Äù.  So, it comes with codes - it is in this sense of the word.  Remember the second code, as shown by years of practice, or at least remember it at a critical moment, no one has yet succeeded.  <b>And here there is only one alarm button - the very highlight that is easily remembered</b> .  Her thief and he will click when he starts to sort through the codes.  And under duress, it is enough for you to dial or inform the robbers of the opening code, in which in any place you specify the number ‚Äú1‚Äù (as an option), or generally report any code with the number 1 that the door does not open - the main thing is that the number ‚Äú1 ".  <b>And the countermeasure algorithm works instantly</b> , but about it at the end. <br><br>  Robberies, though less frequent, but less pleasant.  In an apartment with a robber alone, nothing good will come of you ‚Äî in the complete absence of witnesses ‚Äî so you have two options: <br>  1. If you are a strong pepper, then you can withstand a couple of blows to the body (they probably won't hit the head, so that the code does not fly out of it) and report a non-opening code (any character set containing one). <br>  2. If you are also a hero, but pepper is more relaxed, inform the opening code, but in addition with the same ‚Äúunit‚Äù.  First, they will stop beating you, and then everything will depend on the counteraction system, which will work after pressing the saving unit. <br>  In all cases, help will follow if you read the end of the topic ... <br><br>  The code set can also be spied on - you will say - we don‚Äôt always cover the panel with our hands or bodies when entering with our guests.  There is another secret number in the guest‚Äôs special checkbox, for example, ‚Äú0‚Äù, which you just need to learn how to dial each time you enter more than one.  And for such studies there are all prerequisites, because it is also interesting for household members to know that guests are entering the house.  When you press it, a pleasant melody or sound of the included TV sounds, warning all residents of the apartment (house) to put themselves in order and go out saying hello.  Super useful zest!  <b>Some clients do not need security as much as this feature itself - ‚Äúguests are with me‚Äù.</b> <br><br>  It is easy to memorize these alarm buttons, which you choose yourself - there are only two of them.  Or, if you are not interested in guests, one.  Moreover, the <b>logic of the access control system allows you to press them in any sequence with the lock opening code</b> .  For example, if the opening code is 3465, then: 03465, 34650, 34065, etc.  - all this is the same opening code 3465. Adding zero or one (optional) to any of its places activates the ‚Äúguests‚Äù or ‚Äúdanger‚Äù mode, which can be used for controlled entrance from other people.  In all cases, the person next to him does not see the clean code, and an attempt to repeat any of its combinations will lead to the connection of control from outside parties. <br><br>  Not convinced?  Well, for skeptics, the feature is a permanent code change (in development).  Every month one of the numbers will change, and only the owners can know the logic of this change.  For example, the number ‚Äúthree‚Äù is added to the month number. <br><br>  If you yourself did not understand the logic from the first time, <b>you can open the door from your mobile phone</b> through the SpecLock application.  And there are alarm buttons there too.  But it comes only with a video camera, which shows the one who came.  But, having bought it, you can open the door to guests at a distance - at a very large distance, even from the other end of the world.  And now this ‚Äúdistanc open‚Äù - the <b>real opening of the door, and not the gadget</b> , as in most electronic locks, which have to be strengthened with the usual mechanical, opening only with iron keys.  <b>A special lock is a tough nut to crack, not a kind of latch knocked out by a foot</b> .  In this case, the camera (if available) shows the visitor.  A kind of <b>IP-intercom on the phone</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9c/4f0/88b/c9c4f088bf44456ba3bee5c15cb9459b.jpg"><br><br>  Oh yeah, you forgot to say that the lock has its own IP interface, i.e.  the above functions are not limited to its capabilities.  But first, let's finish with autonomous electronics.  You already have a question in your pocket: what will happen if the electricity is cut off?  There are no faces, you will not open the key, the light will be turned on only tomorrow - they have come!  <b>Power supply - another vulnerable place of electronic-mechanical locks</b> - was.  Let someone say that there was no such problem, because  You can put up a UPS, but the battery in it dies by itself - and for some reason at that moment, when there is no electricity.  An external connection is provided in the special lock; an emergency power supply micro connector is provided outside (in front of the door or anywhere around the house).  By charging from the phone or the car, or any battery in general (even from a screwdriver), you hook up to the power supply of the lock from the outside - and all of its mechanics and logic work again. <br><br>  No, not cut down!  What do you doubt all about?  <b>The developers have thought over everything, including the presentation of a stun gun to this connector</b> .  Inside there is a diode circuit and, already, with lightning protection.  Neither a thunderstorm nor a high voltage is terrible to such a system.  And ... you know how this technology works and you understand that it is not suitable for low-voltage circuits?  Do you even know that most devices of this type and even well-known companies are fiction?  Well, this is a separate topic, and, as you can see, the developers also know about it.  Specifically, in this case, the whole scheme was developed by the manufacturer of this device, and not bought somewhere else, even though it would be easier.  All variants of villainy are tested in real conditions. <br><br>  Well, if there are no questions left on the vulnerability, let's move on to the video for this lock.  Sorry, I hear a couple more questions from the gallery.  Is it possible to bypass the code-dial pad to open the wires to open the lock?  In another situation, we would say "no cannes."  But there are really so many ACS on the market, which are opened in such a childish way that it is more appropriate to answer simply ‚ÄúNO‚Äù.  A direct connection of the lock with the panel is simply not available, information is transmitted via the coded interface to the controller, and it already opens the lock.  The second question: is it possible to select a code?  - Naturally possible.  It is not difficult even to calculate the time for searching all the combinations; it is about two months of continuous poking.  However, after the third wrong code, your <b>photo flies to the phone of the owner</b> or his authorized representatives (with the camera installed).  Well, or even after the first one, they can come for you if you press the ‚Äúalarming number‚Äù in the search.  And here, it is also the way.  It is difficult to run into the long alarm code from ordinary access control systems, and the only tsifirku miss is not destiny. <br><br>  It can be seen, the answers of one comrade did not suit: What are you pouring in here, what are two months?  We tear off the panel, connect by computer through the spy interface and iterate through all your codes in five minutes!  And we will pretend that we did not notice the indignant comrade, especially since the Special Lock also does not respond to codes entered faster than a person can do.  With or without a computer - you have to go through with the same speed.  Although we do not advise, because they will detect almost at the first minute, we have already said that the countermeasure algorithm is described at the end of the topic. <br><br>  No more questions on opening vulnerabilities?  Recognize that the Special Lock is not a lock to be opened?  If not, reread first, if yes, then proceed to the security of the entrance after opening.  <b>The video lock is not limited to mechanical protection</b> .  The door opened by the owner - the threat is still that!  Let the castle honestly worked on the correct code and not under duress, but someone came down from the upper landing and pushed the owner into the apartment! ... <br><br>  First of all, in order to avoid this, it is recommended to have a security <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ip-concierge/blog/275426/">presence sensor</a> in front of the door or, even better, the application on the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ip-concierge/blog/276096/">GEO sensor</a> phone is better ‚Äî to <b>protect yourself</b> anyway is <b>easier than to defend</b> .  But even without them, a rescue button for the ‚Äú <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ip-concierge/blog/276942/">chain</a> ‚Äù algorithm goes to the castle, which, after entering the house, activates the countermeasure system in deferred mode.  With this button, the host can disable the alarm triggering - provided that no one has prevented him from entering on his own, and he can do it physically.  If the hands are tied or consciousness is disabled, then the countermeasure algorithm will inevitably work. <br><br>  And now the most important thing is what opposition can be?  Of course, the most different, someone can connect to the alarm system of a private security company, someone to a simple siren ... Chop, you can trust the property, but not life.  Rather, "guards without rights" will call the owner (if he has not forgotten to activate the alarm, going to the trash), they will be asked to say the code.  Or rather, they will not react, because their electronics are primitive and are neutralized once or twice, and without signs of an accident.  A screaming siren is good, but not for long, it is usually found in the first minute and quickly chopped off.  Neighbors will find it even faster when it works by mistake, and moreover during the owner‚Äôs vacation. <br><br>  What, in our opinion about the chop you do not trust?  Sorry, if offended, we have reason not to trust the security organizations, which are complexed to the sensor equipment, especially from the outdated and easily predictable private security regulations.  Suppose that the PSC or PSB is cool, but they are unlikely to guard your tricky lock.  Okay, let's go further, even if they accept it, but they are unlikely to come after the third pressing of the panic button on the code set by children indulging in the doorway.  Or after yesterday's tedious door opening drunken owner.  Just sensors are not informative.  For reliable counteraction, we need systems of death ... <br><br>  Oh, sorry, the article time is over, the director in the studio warns that we have gone beyond the limits.  We will talk about counteraction algorithms separately, if you allow, right after this article ... The fact is that we told only 50% of the capabilities of this lock, can you imagine if you have to add five more pages here!  Moreover, it will be a question of an additional device that can be used independently - for any type of lock, making them almost as impregnable.  Thus, the special lock has a double openness.  Or so to say it is impossible?  <b>Non-revealing - it is either there or not</b> .  And all these levels of protection from evil.  But more on that further ... <br><br>  <i>Lastly, the anegdotal case: The burglar tried for a long time to open the unlocked locks that remained from the old use of the door.</i>  <i>Only in the police, he learned that these locks have long been not used.</i>  <i>The door was locked on the locks - invisible</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>system "Spetszamok."</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b1/72d/929/0b172d9291694b62a4df347fc6783bab.jpg"><br><br></i>  <i>He found a full arsenal of hacking tools, but he did not help.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/087/5d3/e45/0875d3e45dae43d9bd5124a1b8972e62.jpg"><br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396723/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396723/</a></p>
