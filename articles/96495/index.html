      at 7:27 pm I dialed the QIWI support number (nowhere on the terminal, I had to look on the Internet through the phone).  The girl says that it‚Äôs okay for me not to worry, write down the terminal number and write about everything that happens to them by e-mail. <br><br>  Found the terminal number, at the same time I saw the number of the owner of the terminal.  Let me think I'll call you.  Not available.  I think, okay, everything happens, on Tuesday they will decide everything, the girl promised. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Tuesday came.  On my letter of June 13, no response or greetings. <br><br>  I sent a second letter.  Answered: ‚ÄúHello!  You need to contact the owner of the terminal, his number is listed on the check. " <br><br>  ‚ÄúOops!‚Äù - I think.  How so?  What did not immediately say at my first appeal on that day?  Yes, and on what check, because I described the problem as accurately as possible, it is clear that no one gave me a check.  I call them.  Please connect with the manual.  They refuse.  Begin to switch by department.  As a result, they say that this is not their problem and that I would understand with the owner of the terminal. <br><br>  The number of the owner of the terminal, which is unavailable all these days and which I informed them, comes by e-mail. <br><br>  The thought was that it was the owner who needed to be tortured, since he would come for the next money, he would see my 5000 bill and take it, and then you would not prove anything to anyone. <br><br>  Maybe someone faced with a similar situation?  What to do next? <br><br>  <strong>UPD.</strong>  Transferred to "Payment systems" <br>  <strong>UPD.</strong>  06/16/2010 11:00 AM The letters sent yesterday asked how I should act and what to do there are no answers.  Letters were sent to: support@qiwi.ru, help@qiwi.ru, claim@osmp.ru, ar@qiwi.ru, a.romanenko@qiwi.ru, by phone they say that this is not their problem and that I would understand with the owner of the terminal.  Terminal owner number is not available all this time.  With the manual do not connect. <br>  <strong>UPD.</strong>  06/16/2010 14:04 Called from QIWI.  They said that my request was formed.  They told to wait, they contact the owner of the terminal and something will be known in the evening. <br>  <strong>UPD.</strong>  06/16/2010 22:20 The evening arrived, the promised call / letter from QIWI was not received.  For some reason, I'm not even surprised ... <br>  <strong>UPD.</strong>  06/17/2010 11:00 Unaware of the promised call / letter, I called QIWI on my own.  They said that the application is being processed, that they are trying to contact the owner of the terminal and clarify the situation.  They promised to call back. <br>  <strong>UPD.</strong>  06/17/2010 11:38 I called as I understood from the conversation, the owner of the terminal, said that the bill was found, asked how convenient it was to return it.  Agreed on the transfer of money to Yandex. Money.  We are waiting ... <br><br>  <strong>UPD.</strong>  06/18/2010 01:45 Cheers!  It happened.  An amount of 4950 rubles (-50 rubles commission for transfer through QIWI) was received on my Yandex Money account.  I consider the question closed. <br><br>  Thank you all for your support, help and interesting discussions. <br><br>  The future in Russia, in the Russian business, for customer-oriented companies. <br>  For those who are ready to solve customer problems, be responsible for their partners, intermediaries, etc.  Problems should be solved when the client calls for support, and not after disclosing it to half of the Internet.  I sincerely wish QIWI to learn how to make good and quality service.  Personally, I will not use the QIWI service anymore. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96495/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96495/</a></p>
