The whole family of fonts with different parameters, which is in the public domain. <br><br>  Artyom Geller asks the community to answer a few questions: <br><ul><li>  What character should the font have for government systems? </li><li>  Should it be as official as the state itself? </li></ul><br><br>  The project to improve digital interaction with the state is initiated by people for people, and the team wants to reflect these aspirations.  The result of the first discussions and a cursory analysis of state fonts of different countries: the basis is taken by the modern Dutch grotesque - humanistic and friendly.
