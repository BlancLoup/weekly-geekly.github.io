  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A startup without pink glasses</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, Habralyudi!  Many people write about their successful startups, as a result of which many start-up startups see the world of startups in bright colors, and I want to tell an instructive story of one interesting start-up unfulfilled by me (bootstrapping) so that newcomers like me would not step on a rake (at least mine). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How it all began </h4><br>  In the autumn of this year I decided to buy a netbook (for work and study) and first of all I opened the great Google in order to find a suitable model in the city‚Äôs online stores, which, by the way, turned out to be quite a few.  The model picked up the next task that worried me - to find a store in which the price for it will be minimal.  The next day, full of energy, I went to computer stores.  Having lost almost a whole day and almost all physical and moral strength, I still bought what I wanted.  Tired, but glad I was going home, thinking about how good it would be if there was such a service on the Internet that collected information about prices in stores for goods and sorted by price!  So, actually, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup was born. <br><br><h4>  What's next </h4><br>  And then I interviewed all the friends in touch, whether such a service would be useful to them and whether they would use it.  The result met expectations - most of the friends responded positively.  Inspired by this, I, without delaying the time, began to implement the idea (by the way, on that netbook).  Joyful thoughts about how things would be going round in my head, utopian (unfortunately) pictures of the <s>site page</s> with reviews of satisfied users, etc. presented themselves.  The search for like-minded programmer friends has ended epic fail, but it didn‚Äôt upset me much, on the wave of happy thoughts, I thought that I‚Äôll do it alone. <br><br>  After a one-and-a-half weekly work, the service turned out, which in my opinion was already ready for testing by users.

      What was in it: categories of goods with photos and descriptions, user registration (two types: user and organization), including the entrance through social.  networks, top stores with the best prices (users could vote, which influenced the store rating) for each product, comments, cities (when selecting a city, only shops of this city were displayed), adding goods and stores by registered users, social buttons.  networks. <br><br><h4>  So what? </h4><br>  Then I took up the addition of goods and promotion.  I was a <s>bootstrapper</s> alone, I didn‚Äôt have finances, two months of working alone didn‚Äôt give any results in principle - 10 people a day were maximum, not a single product or store added by users, not a single comment.  Then my hands went down, I was not going to ask for money from investors or to take a loan - apparently, I was still not sure of success.  The project was successfully abandoned by me until "better times." <br><br><h4>  The moral of this story is </h4><br>  And the moral is: ‚Äúalone in the field is not a warrior‚Äù - <b>firstly</b> , support is needed (even just moral) initiatives by at least 2-3 people - <b>secondly</b> , money, of course, is not the main thing, but without them, it <b>is thirdly</b> . <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> I do not pretend to the truth in the first station, but I hope you have been useful.  I am ready to listen to your criticism, take note.  If there are people who are interested in this idea, take it, for me personally the need for such a service has not disappeared.  <i>Again, I'm not going to take it.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136278/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136278/</a></p>
