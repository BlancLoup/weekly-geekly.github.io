The answer is obviously no, and you have more important things to do, but let's imagine the opposite? <br><br>  Everybody gossips about how safe and unavoidable cryptocurrencies are, which makes you sad because you like to control everything, right?  Bitcoin is really much more difficult than just arresting a few people and closing the server. <br><br>  But there are miners, most of them are in your country, and all you need to do is the dirty trick "51% attack."

Purchase</b> <br><br>  Buy all the mining farm you find, register verified accounts (10-40 each).  Thus, we have about 100 farms and 40 accounts on each.  Great.  Let's buy $ 100m BTC.  You are the government; you can afford it for national security, right? <br><br>  The market capitalization of Bitcoin at the time of writing is $ 95B, i.e.  0.1%. <br>  Send all the money to your own wallets on your desktop. <br><br>  <b>Step 2. Find 51% miners</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  71% according to the <a href="http://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/china/">site</a> is somewhere in China.  They try to be anonymous, but you are China, and they forced people to install <a href="https://thenextweb.com/asia/2017/07/25/chinas-forcing-its-citizens-to-install-a-terrifying-big-brother-app-on-their-phones-or-go-to-jail/">spyware applications</a> on their phones, so this should not be a problem. <br><br>  <b>Step 3. Secret operation</b> <br><br>  Now ask the secret law enforcement unit to find as many miners as possible on day X. <br><br>  Since this is a law enforcement operation, your officers are allowed to send weapons on their heads - this will speed up their thinking process if they pretend they don‚Äôt know what BTC is. <br><br>  This is how the government works when it has a goal.  And since you are China, you do not need to try to look like liberals by doing so. <br><br>  <b>Step 4. Double the time!</b> <br><br>  Make sure that they do the following: they need to issue about 4,000 transactions ($ 25,000 each) from your wallets on your desktop in one block and broadcast them to everyone.  These 4,000 transactions will send money back to all accounts created in step 1. <br><br>  Usually, 6 blocks are required for the exchange, built from above (confirmation) to consider the end of a transaction.  So now the rest of the network will try to create blocks on top of yours.  As long as they do this, you take blockN, send all blockN + 1 to continue working on blockN + 2 and blockN + 3, and focus on developing blockN + 1B and blockN + 2B yourself. <br><br>  You have 51%, so most likely you will be faster than everyone else.  As soon as the miners receive 6 confirmations of your block, you need to request the exchange of your BTC on all the exchanges for something else: Litecoin, Ripple, Ethereum ... whatever.  They usually exchange automatically.  Then you need to send all these altcoins to your desktop wallets again. <br>  After you have exchanged all BTC for Altcoins, start another ‚Äúsecret‚Äù branch, which basically cancels the block with its 4000 transactions. <br><br>  This is called reorganization: now everyone on the network should accept your chain as the main one and forget about all the other transactions that are now orphaned. <br><br>  <b>Step 5. Price = 0</b> <br><br>  This means that bitcoins worth $ 100 million (which are no longer exchanged) were exchanged for altcoins.  Congratulations on the double transaction, you now have $ 200 million cryptocurrency!  The price for them will be equal to 0, but this is the original goal. <br><br>  You can repeat the process again, but you do not need it.  One attack of this size will destroy faith in cryptocurrency for the next few years. <br><br>  There will be no negative reaction from other countries - BTC outside of any country or jurisdiction.  So you can do it in private or in public. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342532/</a></p>
