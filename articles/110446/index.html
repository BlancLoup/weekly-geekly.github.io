  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why the client does not receive the goods on time or all online shopping bastards</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think almost any user of online trading encountered a situation when, having placed an order, having received confirmation from the seller that the order was accepted, having prepared a handful of coins and joyful emotions on the day scheduled for delivery, he was severely disappointed when the store had an apology ( or without) reported (or did not report) that today this product can not deliver, or can not deliver at all. <br><br>  Not always, this situation is simply due to the poor performance of the seller.  Those.  Yes, for the customer, in general, no matter what happened in the stars, the product should be, but it is not, ergo - the store is to blame.  Unfortunately, this approach, at least in terms of the evaluation of a store on a ‚Äúgood-bad‚Äù scale, is not quite correct.  Otherwise, it would be quite easy to determine from whom to order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin, let us show how the product offer is formed in online stores in principle (I consider everything on the example of book projects and their ilk, music, video, games, that is, stores selling leisure goods. In other areas, of course, be strong differences).  Most importantly, it should be understood that the number of SKUs shown on the storefront is ALWAYS different from what is actually in the operational storage warehouse (of course, we are talking only about large online stores, projects at publishers, or narrowware, such as Boffo, are not considered) .  So, Ozone has about 500,000 books in the catalog, about 130,000 in stock. The second largest Internet book project, Labyrinth, has about 150,000 in the catalog, 70,000 in stock. We have a little more in Read.ru on the display case. 700 000, and we can ship the day to the day in the order of the same 70 000 as in the Labyrinth. <br><br>  What is the reason?  The reasons are quite obvious, their two main ones: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      - It makes no sense to store everything in the warehouse, even 1 copy each.  The turnover rate in this case will fly to Alpha Centauri, and about the same owners or investors want to send careless managers.  There is a good example of the fatality of such a policy on the example of the largest player in the offline, Top-book, whose owner in the mid-2000s held at least 1 copy of each position published in Russia.  Then they refused from this, but it was from that time that the Novosibirsk people started having problems, which resulted, as we know, in a change of owners. <br><br>  - The longer the store runs, the more it has a tail from old books, whose circulation has already been sold and which will never be reprinted.  For obvious reasons, no one ever removes such positions from a shop window, but their order, and even less their fulfillment, is practically impossible. <br>  Thus, we understand that a huge proportion of the range is purchased from suppliers "to order."  This is where the problems begin.  What are book suppliers?  These are several hundred publishers, ranging from the largest, such as Eksmo and AST, with a total share of 30-40%, ending with publishing houses sitting in the same room and having a price list of 10 items.  As it is easy to guess, the INFORMATION OF THE ACTUAL INFORMATION ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE GOODS IS: <br>  A) the task is extremely nontrivial in technical terms, <br>  B) the task is 100% basically impracticable. <br><br>  About point I will tell you in the next article, with more technical details, this is really an extremely difficult question in terms of the FULL AUTOMATION of processing all different price lists, which is not fully implemented in any of the existing commercial parsers, and I suspect , in programs written ‚Äúfor myself‚Äù, for at least 6 years of being in the market, I have not heard of such.  But the handler‚Äôs imperfections account for a small proportion of errors;  we, for example, cannot now deliver about 2% of orders received and confirmed by us, of which only 1% (ie, 0.02% of the total number of orders) falls on the ‚Äúinability‚Äù of the software to recognize ‚Äúbad‚Äù cases.  Everything else is B. <br><br>  And here everything is extremely simple and there are only two or three options, which are almost impossible to fight: <br>  - The supplier simply provided incorrect data in his price list, and stated that there was a product he did not have.  This primarily concerns the average size of publishers, which already have many titles, and the technologies are still at Excel level. <br>  - The supplier provided the right balances, but then he sold the entire position to someone.  Regular trouble regarding market leaders. <br>  - The supplier simply has discrepancies between the paper and the actual stock balance.  It happens at all. <br><br>  And in the case of the implementation of any of the above situations, we get a case where the seller cannot fulfill the accepted order generally for reasons beyond his control.  Of course, I emphasize once again that the client is in principle not internesno, and the situation with him, in any case, must be brought to zero.  But how this or that store does it is a matter of a separate conversation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110446/</a></p>
