  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Summer, hello. We cope with the heat with the help of a personal mini-conditioner Evapolar</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c1/666/3df/2c16663dffd963f97c5c18906540005d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the snow in May in some regions, it‚Äôs even strange to talk about the heat.  In any case, from June to August, residents of many countries and regions will have a hard time.  The most effective way to combat elevated temperatures in the room and car - air conditioning.  It is worth noting that it is one of the most energy-intensive ways to cool the room, and when the air conditioner is installed in the office, there will always be someone who ‚Äúblows‚Äù. <br><br>  Because of such trifles, I don‚Äôt want to clash, so there is one right decision - to cool down with the help of a miniature Evapolar conditioner.  This device creates an individual temperature for a specific user within a radius of 2-3 meters (temperature and radius are regulated).  In addition, domestic developers Vladimir Levitin and Evgeny Dubovoy created this device. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Initially, they designed the device, and then decided to try to raise funds for its production with the help of crowdfunding <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/world-s-first-personal-air-conditioner">platform Indiegogo</a> .  And it turned out!  The authors of the idea collected more than $ 1,234,704, and the idea was developed.

While most air conditioners operate on large areas, cooling everything that is needed and not needed, Evapolar operates locally.  It is important to understand that this mini air conditioner should not be used as an alternative to large industrial air conditioners.  But as a personal device in the office or at home, it is almost perfect. <br><br><h3>  Some technical details </h3><br>  The basis of Evapolar is ‚Äúnano-paper‚Äù (no-no, Chubais and his nano-production have nothing to do with it) from basalt, which serves as an evaporator.  The diameter of the basalt fiber is only 40 nm.  This provides the material with the ability to absorb liquids more than the material itself weighs.  Plates made of such basalt paper provide effective moistening of the cooling cartridge.  The developers claim that the mold and bacteria in the cartridge do not multiply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/511/ea5/bf5/511ea5bf51980135683154fe2b9ae013.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the principle of Evapolar, it is based on the natural evaporation of water.  Water evaporates, the temperature drops, everything is simple and strictly according to science.  According to the authors, their development is one of the most effective in this area.  Evaporative air conditioners are designed to cool and humidify hot dry air.  If the humidity is above 70%, in this case the effectiveness of Evapolar drops.  Since the humidity in most rooms does not exceed 60% (and in most cases much lower), Evapolar is suitable for the vast majority of apartments or offices. <br><br>  Water comes from a tank that needs to be filled regularly.  One ‚Äúcharge‚Äù lasts about 3-5 hours of work.  If you want a longer period of validity, then you can fill the tank with water, wait until the cartridge absorbs moisture and add water.  The walls of the tank are transparent so that the user can see how much water is left.  As soon as the water begins to run out, air conditioning warns about this.  The system can work as an ordinary fan, without water at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac6/902/692/ac6902692b4ad9e517ca4a7d7f7591c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The weight of the device is 1.68 kg.  The evaporation rate, which contributes to the cooling of the air, is adjustable by the user.  Well, the energy consumption in Evapolar is about 12 times less than that of a conventional wall or floor conditioner.  At the same time, the advantage of the system is that you cannot get a cold with it.  Evapolar air temperature can be lowered in a limited radius, about 10 degrees below room temperature.  The maximum temperature drop with Evapolar is 15 degrees Celsius. <br><br>  Plus, the smallest droplets of water improve the microclimate of the room, they are useful for the skin and respiratory system.  These droplets contribute to the purification of air from dust.  There was no external smell during operation. Evapolar was not noticed. <br><br>  The technology itself is not unique.  It is already used, for example, in industrial evaporative coolers.  But industry is one thing, and an office or home is another.  Here the device that creates a zone of personal microclimate in a small amount of space is very useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a10/ca9/e08/a10ca9e085471ade57e61236d006c4d9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All you need to do - fill the tank with water and set the desired mode of operation of the device.  As soon as the cartridge takes in enough water to work (it takes a couple of minutes), Evapolar starts working.  The principle of operation of the device can be called "quiet cool", because the cube is almost silent.  There is no battery inside, so the device must be connected to the network or charged using a USB cable from a computer / laptop. <br><br><h3>  Main characteristics </h3><br>  ‚Ä¢ Creates a personal microclimate around the user due to the natural evaporation of water.  Optimum for hot climate. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Cools the air in front of you for 3 m2 of space, for example, around a table or bed. <br>  ‚Ä¢ "Three in One": cools, moisturizes and cleans the air from dust, to breathe easier. <br>  ‚Ä¢ It consumes only 10 watts (100 times less than a conventional air conditioner) and can operate on a portable battery. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Does not contain toxic refrigerants.  Water tank capacity: 750 ml.  Cooling capacity: 100‚Äì350 W (350‚Äì1200 BTU / hour). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Environmentally friendly and safe: CE and ETL certified.  Manufacturer's warranty: 1 year. <br><br><h3>  And when can I buy? </h3><br>  Soon.
