One lacks willpower, others assiduity or focus.  There are many reasons and everyone will have their own. <br>  When I set goals and did not reach them, I blamed everything, including the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù notebook and laziness.  Guilt was growing and did not help in achieving their goals. <br><br>  Then I turned to the services to achieve the goals, the first one I came across was <a href="https://smartprogress.do/%3Fac%3D444">SmartProgress</a> <abbr title="Referral link">‚òÖ</abbr> .  He turned out to be free, which is nice, and deciding not to postpone, he began to set himself. <br>  Created a goal - to open a pet store with a meager budget.  I started to register everything I needed, set the implementation date, picked up a motivating picture, and tomorrow I will start to open the store. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But the next morning it turned out that you need to add a couple more photos, to answer a few comments.  So two more days passed. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And then I realized that I didn‚Äôt really want to open a store, it‚Äôs better to leave everything as it is and not change anything. <br><br>  This was my first mistake. <br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  <b>Do not work for a long time goal - start doing</b> </h2><br><br><hr><br>  For a week I didn‚Äôt remember my goal, spat on its maintenance in the service.  On the eighth day, I woke up with the thought: "If I don‚Äôt even try to open a store, I will never forgive myself for that." <br>  Grabbing an old notebook, I began to sketch a goal and a map of steps to achieve it.  It turned out that I don‚Äôt quite understand how to set goals correctly, the benefit in Google is not banned, and soon I came across a SMART system. <br><br><h2>  What is a goal setting for SMART </h2><br><h3>  Specific </h3><br>  The main thing in the statement on the SMART - specifics, the goal should be clear and accessible.  There are no emergency exits or loopholes for the subconscious, which our brain can use to elude or make excuses for non-fulfillment. <br><br>  For example: <br>  Open a pet shop - here is a store for the opening.  Receive from the pet store monthly N rubles.  Here the goal is to make a profit of N rubles. <br><br><h3>  Measurable </h3><br>  An important condition is the criteria for evaluating the achievement of a goal. <br><br>  For example: <br>  Exit to turnover in N rubles / month, where N is the same criterion. <br><br><h3>  Attainable </h3><br>  The goal must be achievable, otherwise its implementation will be out of the question. <br><br>  For example: <br>  Fly to Mars tomorrow is a bad target.  Tomorrow spring cleaning is a good goal. <br><br><h3>  Significant </h3><br>  The goal must be meaningful and important for the person who set it.  I don‚Äôt care about the preservation of the lemming population, so the goal of ‚ÄúRescue a population of lemmings in 2016‚Äù I will not achieve, even if I put it.  At the same time, the goal of ‚ÄúWarming up a dog house until December 1‚Äù is important for me.  And I will fulfill it, because the life and health of my pet depends on it. <br><br><h3>  Time limited </h3><br>  It is very important in setting a goal to set time limits.  If you do not put yourself in the frame, then you can open a pet shop all your life, and to insulate the dog box after it dies.  Having set the goal ‚ÄúGain 15 kg of muscle mass by April 1‚Äù, I immediately determine the deadline.  If I don‚Äôt have 15 kg of muscles before the first of April, and I‚Äôm going to pick them up only by June, the goal is not reached. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <b>SMART = KIDZO</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Concrete, measurable, achievable, meaningful, limited in time</b> </h2><br><hr><br><br><h2>  The main thing is to formulate the goal correctly. </h2><br><br>  Running through SMART and sketching a goal for opening a pet store, I did this: <br><br>  <b>S</b> : Successfully open a pet shop. <br>  <b>M</b> : Within three months, it should go to zero. <br>  <b>A</b> : Though difficult, but real. <br>  <b>R</b> : It is important for me to assert myself in such a way and make sure that I am ‚ÄúBoy-Who-Smog‚Äù. <br>  <b>T</b> : If after three months the store does not go to zero, close it and not return to this idea in the near future. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/034/6cb/eff/0346cbeff8f642e6966e083e37b6131e.jpg">  I also immediately sketched a plan of action, it included: to find a room, select suppliers, organize advertising and make a sign. <br><br>  I also wrote a calculation in the notebook and adjusted the figures to fit the budget.  As a result, after three days, all the information necessary for opening a store was collected in a notebook: phone numbers of suppliers, cost estimates, numbers and addresses of premises for rent, etc., etc., etc.  For me, it was all a commercial secret, and therefore I kept it at my heart and did not part even at night. <br><br>  As a result, on the sixth day of my brainstorming, I lost a notebook somewhere in a bus or a minibus.  It was a big blow - I instantly lost my motivation.  All the work went to ashes. <br><br><h2>  Why not be afraid to share ideas </h2><br>  Disappointed in the physical media, I turned to the Internet.  Returning to my goal, which I abandoned 17 days ago, I was pleasantly surprised by comments from complete strangers.  They were interested in how things were going, wished success, someone was even ready to give advice.  The strangers helped me to believe the idea again.  Then I decided to add specifics: I rewrote my goal in accordance with SMART, added key details - they served as anchors.  And everything started spinning. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <b>Support is important in any endeavor.</b> </h2><br><hr><br>  In the end, after a week I rented a room near the house.  After another five days, there were shelves in it, and I began to ‚Äúsmear‚Äù the goods on the shelves, because of the limited budget, there were few goods.  Two weeks later, the store‚Äôs doors were open and we met the first customer, the neighbor tenant.  Then there were price wars with closest competitors, problems with suppliers, force majeure with the room and much more.  The store worked for a year and a half and was closed at the end of August 2016, but this is another story. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion: Notebook can replace SmartProgress </h2><br>  The usual notebook, for the most part, fully satisfies the requirements of goal-setting.  Here is a comparison: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  <nobr>Parameter</nobr> </th><th>  <nobr>Notebook</nobr> </th><th>  <nobr>Smartprogress</nobr> </th><th>  <nobr>Points</nobr> </th></tr><tr><td>  <nobr>Mobility</nobr> </td><td>  Easy to put in your pocket </td><td>  Available on PC, iOS, Android </td><td>  1/1 </td></tr><tr><td>  <nobr>Availability</nobr> </td><td>  You can buy in any stall Presses </td><td>  Free use </td><td>  1/1 </td></tr><tr><td>  <nobr>Visualization</nobr> </td><td>  Draw what you want - paper will endure everything </td><td>  Pick up the right photo or paste pictures from the Paint </td><td>  1 / 0.5 </td></tr><tr><td>  SMART </td><td>  Write as you like, no restrictions </td><td>  All sharpened by SMART </td><td>  1/1 </td></tr><tr><td>  <nobr>Motivation</nobr> </td><td>  Promise yourself that in case of non-fulfillment - you will throw money into the account of your foe. <br>  The main thing is to fulfill your own promise </td><td>  The price of the word: just enter the amount and if you have not reached the goal - you will no longer see your money </td><td>  0.5 / 1 </td></tr><tr><td>  <nobr>Sociality</nobr> </td><td>  No, if only to give someone to read their goals </td><td>  By default, everyone can see the goals, but if that - you can set privacy. </td><td>  0/1 </td></tr><tr><td>  <nobr>Security</nobr> </td><td>  If you do not lose a notebook, then no one will get your goals </td><td>  Whatever the encryption and protection systems are, it is better not to sow a commercial secret on the Internet. </td><td>  0.5 / 0 </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Total</b> </td><td>  <b>5 points</b> </td><td>  <b>5.5 points</b> </td></tr></tbody></table>  <i>As can be seen from the table, the difference between the service to achieve the goals and the good old notebook is small.</i> <br><br>  Everyone is free to choose himself, based on tastes and preferences.  In addition, using the services do not necessarily give up the notebook, and vice versa.  I chose for daily use - a notebook.  It bribed the opportunity to draw, draw and mark on the fields. <br>  But when a new idea emerges, which I want to tell the world and get people's opinions, <a href="https://smartprogress.do/%3Fac%3D444">SmartProgress</a> <abbr title="Referral link">‚òÖ</abbr> helps me out.  Thanks to the extremely heterogeneous audience, it is possible to learn the opinion of many people and sometimes get advice. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <b>Every work has its own tool.</b> </h2><br><hr><br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/%3Fac%3D444"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/623/b96/75d/623b9675d4be4ad69974a661aae30321.jpg" alt="image"></a>  <abbr title="Referral link">‚òÖ</abbr> <br><br>  That's all for today.  Do not limit yourself in opportunities, discarding the available tools. <br><br>  <b>Good luck and success to all!</b> <br><br><hr><br>  Read more of our articles on our blog: <a href="http://smarttalks.club/">SmartTalks</a> <br><br><hr><br>  <i>UPD: Mark referral links - <abbr title="Referral link">‚òÖ</abbr></i> <i><br></i>  <i>Thanks, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/jogger/" class="user_link">Jogger</a> , for the advice!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317184/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317184/</a></p>
