But in real life, of course, everything is much more neglected - there is a successful cohort of ‚Äúearly adopters‚Äù, and as can be seen in the well-known picture of the ‚Äúdilemma of the innovator‚Äù, there is a big chasm, and either those who are completely unaware of, or who about Agile ‚Äú everything is clear, because the neighbor-Rabinovich sang. "  This is evident even in a number of recent publications on the mega brain.  Therefore, the real, and even not always successful, experience from those who are in the subject and found all the rakes, and a bunch of nishtyakov - is very useful and much more relevant than even books, as a rule, already obsolete by the time of publication.  The speakers were not evangelicals, but practitioners from large companies and start-ups, although yes, there were consultants telling about the ‚Äúbending of the unbending‚Äù, such as the banks' bailout. <br><br>  It was great there - you missed a lot if you weren‚Äôt there.  But.  Video recordings and other report materials are published and will be available to everyone.  My recording is good, everything is as usual - montage, several cameras, a screen, sound from a microphone, animation technology. <br><br>  And I, as a member of the program committee, making sure that the speakers convey their knowledge to all those interested, I will try to make a series of publications, including the video of the report, abstracts and slides, and my very brief review.  An elephant needs to be eaten in parts - not all videos are ready yet, it‚Äôs still necessary to watch and reflect, and even large articles scare readers and writers with its volume ‚Äî I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that in a few visits I couldn‚Äôt finish writing an epic review of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/album/2807326">72</a> video reports from the past of AgileDays-2014, and even a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://megamozg.ru/post/5234/">review of 2011</a> mastered only six months later.  Of course, the Agile conference review should be done iteratively, as quickly as possible by shipping <i>value to</i> consumers.  And, as is customary in Agile, it is even possible to stop shipments if users do not like the product ...

Here, not only the commandments of the Agile Manifesto and the simple hygienic rules of Scrum / Kanban are considered here and in the context of new-fashioned Lean-frameworks of product management, it is also told about engineering Agile practices, and about managerial aspects of changes - game theory and leadership.  Of course, at the end there are a lot of questions from those who really ‚Äúwent to battle for agile‚Äù in their companies and the guru's answers to difficult questions (‚Äúaaa, what to do with ossified companies? ...‚Äù - ‚ÄúPersuade the customer. Or work as he wants. "). <br><br>  By the way, Boris is on the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://megamozg.ru/users/blv/">mega brain</a> , so if you like the reports, you can thank him in an understandable way.  :) And I have more reports of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/Category:%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581_%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2584%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">Boris</a> , I recommend. <hr><h3>  Development of project management and quality criteria in IT </h3>  This is a great continuation of the theme of the ‚Äúguru of the history, philosophy and culture of Agile‚Äù, from widely known in narrow circles of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mtsepkov.org/">Maxim ‚ÄúGandalf‚Äù Tsepkov</a> . <blockquote>  Project management and quality criteria in IT have come a long way in historical development, replacing several models. <br><br>  It all began with the perfect software (software system) as a result of high-quality design, typical of R &amp; D. <br><br>  Then there was a period of comprehensive rationing of processes for their development (PMBoK 3, RUP), which was replaced, in part by revolutionary, by flexible approaches to development (SCRUM, Kanban), which emphasized the timing and predictability of delivery. <br><br>  And now the focus has shifted to customer satisfaction and achieving business goals (OMG Essence of Software Engineering). <br><br>  But development has not stopped. <br><br>  The lack of understanding of the place of specific approaches, methodologies and practices in the context of the overall development of the industry does not allow the system to use them effectively and gives rise to many empty discussions among developers on how to properly. <br><br>  During the report, we consider the main milestones in the development of approaches to the management of IT projects and the evolution of software quality criteria in the world and in Russia, which in the 90s went its own way, but recently approached general trends.  And also we will figure out for which projects and teams one or another project management model is appropriate, in what their advantages and disadvantages may lie and what forms of development organization correspond to them.  Understanding this will allow not only to set up processes in your project, but also to have meaningful discussions with supporters of other forms of organization that are often found among customers and management. </blockquote><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/123181695&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhimuwzV16JKt_FXXlDhKCkFJUWaZA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="20150319BD Development of project management and quality criteria" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>  <br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20150319BD">additional materials</a> <br><br>  If in the past AgileDays Maxim talked about the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140321-59">fantastic concepts of Spiral Dynamics</a> , then this time everything is quite historical and scientific. <br><br>  The history of development, from the time of industrial R &amp; D, through the world of Brooks's man-month, to the rise and final fall of waterfall, from eXtreme Programming, as a desperate and failed programmer's rebellion, to completely working management SCRUMs.  All of this Agile-movement is quite reasonable, and could not fail to appear, for a bunch of reasons - and ‚ÄúIT Nature <s>does not tolerate emptiness</s> interferes with the procedures ¬©‚Äù and the high cost of classical scaling with a bunch of sergeant managers (not to mention the ideal wildly expensive PMBOK-managers , which is vanishingly small), and the variability of the nature of IT development - ‚Äúwhile we attack the enemy changes the landscape ¬©‚Äù ... Well, in general, now ‚Äúsane developers do not go to bureaucratic offices ¬©‚Äù. <br><br>  The future is foggy, maybe OMG ‚ÄúOmaigot!‚Äù Essence from SEMAT, where old concepts at the word level are cut down (clear out all references to ‚Äúproject‚Äù), but in the glossary, there are solid ‚Äústakeholder‚Äù and ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù, but ... ‚Äústandard descriptors don't have time behind the development of the industry - they are also old ¬© ‚Äù. <br><br>  The Russian path to Agile, in a certain sense, is simple, because it was not coming ‚Äúfrom a riot at the plant,‚Äù as in the west, but mainly from the ‚Äúscientific culture‚Äù of the ruined scientific research institutes that launched the Russian IT industry.  I was pleased that Maxim quoted <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lib.custis.ru/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%258B_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_%2528%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8_%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%2529">my review of ‚ÄúCultures of software projects‚Äù</a> <br><br>  And you can argue with Maxim in his <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mtsepkov.org/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3:%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0/2015-03-22:_AgileDays-2015_-_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">post with a review of the conference</a> . <br><br><br><hr><h3>  What is this dual-track agile? </h3><blockquote>  One of the great merits of Agile is that it allows you to make the most significant backlog. <br><br>  But even if we do only the most significant, and we do it by accompanying retrospectives, TDD, code quality procedures, it may turn out that the product will not be valuable for business and will not meet the goals of the user.  The fact is that the client doesn‚Äôt know well what he is asking for until he tries it. <br><br>  The approach, called Dual-track Agile, even before a significant investment in the development will help to understand what is really necessary and useful, measure the benefits, change the initial ideas for the best and completely unexpected. <br><br>  In the report, you will see several cases of applying this approach on a real product at Kaspersky Lab, as well as how product pivots and MVP significantly affect business results. </blockquote><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/123181700&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-gEPywCXM_NKaj_gMEhTcgHwzsA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="20150320AE What is this for Dual-track Agile?" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20150320AE">additional materials</a> <br><br>  In the report, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/Category:%25D0%2598%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%258F_%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2586%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">Ilya Kuznetsov</a> immediately boldly hit Agile, that he, supplying effective processes ‚Äúhow to do it quickly and efficiently‚Äù, does not think at all that it is necessary first of all to ‚Äúmake the right product‚Äù.  It was probably such a polemic device, for the audience and the audience even tried to argue with the speaker, defending the honor of the <i>Holy and Cherished Agile Manifesta</i> , and the program committee members (‚ÄúWAT? What does he bring? Who let him? Who has reviewed his report?‚Äù) .  After all, labor-Agile is about doing the right thing and the right thing, and the gain always comes precisely from more accurate hitting the target, and the savings are precisely due to the deprioritization of the unimportant, and what he was talking about is essentially ‚ÄúProduct Discovery‚Äù food practices from Agile and Lean approaches. <br><br>  But I agree, for those who associate Agile with those who have been learned in the ‚Äúdon't think, do so‚Äù mode for Scrum &amp; Kanban in an hour, you can really get the impression that you have forgotten about the product and it is useful to remind you about it. <br><br>  In fact, it was a retelling, with some variations, of his report ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20141023CG">Template break - Lean Product Management and MVP in a large company</a> ‚Äù from SECR-2014, with the same cases (‚Äústartup for farmers‚Äù, ‚Äúinstaller bug in trial antivirus‚Äù , etc.), the same flexible practices of Lean Startup, which are symbiotically germinating inside the huge engines of a huge company.  In any case, the report is excellent, vigorous, with good grades ( <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20141023CG">its SECR</a> version was generally ranked first), I recommend for viewing. <br><br>  It is a little true that such talents and forces are spent on the fear-trading antivirus business.  After all, the true purpose of Agile is to bring happiness to the user, and not just to make a ‚Äúvaluable product‚Äù that can be more expensive, with cunning hacks with a shadow installation and manipulation of the user.  Few people know that the free antivirus pulls the full version in the background, uses it, but as the postman Pechkin ‚Äúdoes not give the package, because you have no documents‚Äù.  And the team is not the fact that good, superheroes - ‚Äúhipster-hustler-hacker‚Äù - follow the stopwatch with the merged behavior of users, deciding when to hook, so as not to leave ... Oh, I'm afraid at the next AgileDays will be SEO / SMM / spam startups, online poker where you can lose your wife, shops selling organs ... Perhaps then I will have to leave the program committee ... <br><br>  However, I remember how a couple of times we solved potential problems to potential customers with a single consultation (‚Äúintegration information system? ‚ÄîAnd can we overload copy-paste here? - Indeed, thank you!‚Äù), And they did not give money for it.  And happiness must be borne not only by users, but also by all participants in the process - including developers.

It works of course, but in a multi-year epic project with a GUI, such as a CAD system, which should survive the change of a heap of technologies and frameworks, it is more important to make a flexible platform and focus on integration tests, including GUI testing.  So that it would be non-fragile, of course, the classic Hindu approach with TestComplete screen macro recordings, the task is not overpowered, we need a flexible GUI platform and write ‚Äúvisual‚Äù tests based on the interface model that do not break when the button is moved.  So many people actually do it, just remember that Netbeans is developing and testing this way, and a number of lesser-known products.

Semyon matured and matured (in professional and life terms).  During this time, he managed to work with several agile-teams and to see a lot of different scraps and shame, to fill the next cones when introducing the design process into flexible development processes.  But in all cases, he saw that some designer tools could be useful to other participants in the process, teams that do not have interface designers on their staff.  After all, these tools are easy to understand and do not require much time to work out.  And Semyon decided to try First on his team, and then on cats, that is, on familiar teams.  All the successful (accustomed in the teams) solutions, he, according to the good old tradition, was recorded in his notebook, which now bore the name UX in the service of Agile. <br><br>  What topics touched Simon, where and what tools of the UX-specialist he tried to implement: <ul><li>  how else (except for the usual tools) can you collect and record requirements regarding the planned features; </li><li>  how can you upgrade the user story in the direction of greater empathy for users and what tools can help with this; </li><li>  break up large user stories into smaller ones as much as possible (again, with more empathy); </li><li>  how to fix the overall experience of user interaction, so that in the next iteration not to break the wood when implementing new features.  After all, it is always difficult to keep in mind the whole picture of human interaction with the product.  And when you add all new and new features, often instead of the help sticks are inserted into wheels; </li><li>  how you can use your favorite impact map to work out the user's goals; </li><li>  How can I check the need for features (or rather, the expected satisfaction with the presence / absence) before placing them in the backlog. </li></ul></blockquote><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/123181711&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiec3jxmVyEJKK310JZMoTFfpaj7g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="20150319BF As a UX specialist, he shared his tools with agile teams" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20150319BF">additional materials</a> <br><br>  Yes, Agile is also usability.
