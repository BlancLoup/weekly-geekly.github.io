      Messenger - who saved (?) Last year from bankruptcy; <br>  Eneter is a kind of daughter (or rather, a kidney) of the same contact who is bankrupt this year; <br>  Ozon is the one that for many years cannot even reach the point of recoupment; <br>  Lamoda - the one that showed profitability last year only through new investments; <br><br>  As well as Eldorado, 220 volts, Otto, KupiVip and other resellers from the <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2462742">TOP-100</a> . <br><br>  <b>Who is not?</b>  Recently <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/28/10/2014/544f7f5fcbb20f2953018873">, E-Bay came out</a> of this organization and the reasons were as follows: "... support and <b>lobbying by AKIT of the</b> draft law on lowering the threshold for duty-free purchases in foreign online stores from ‚Ç¨ 1,000 per month to ‚Ç¨ 150 per purchase ... Another initiative that ACIT advocates, but not eBay, is a ban on parallel imports (supplying goods to a country without the consent of the producers of these goods: for example, buying iPhones in the US at US prices and selling them in Russia). "  Simply put: instead of competition, we are being monitored again and again.  By the way, Wikimart left the organization for the same reason. <br><br>  <b>Summary of the previous series.</b>  In the Russian Federation, a deliberate policy of monopolizing the e-commerce market has been going on for a long time: it is the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn the National Payment System‚Äù, which I will discuss in the second part, but which dared all the small players in online payments and led to the fact that how remittances happened was not just stagnation, but the general destruction of one and all (Raiffeisen's Fast Mail is closed; Contact - squeezed out or squeezed and far from a lemon and as a result merged with a leading competitor - Golden Crown under the auspices of a small, ratite bird - with this  m Unistream, to their regret, while under it's wing did not get, though, and fled, dangling tongue on his shoulder; MoneyGram in Russia can be sent, but it turns out - with difficulty; Instantly - buried under the wording of the boring CBR). <br><br>  In addition, it was after this law, which <b>bankers hoped for,</b> rubbing their sweaty hands with pleasure in anticipation of mergers and takeovers (and with them the <b>bees that lay eggs in the mouthpiece of a</b> single gust and cannot even give birth to a mouse, so that the trio become a quartet), The massacre of NGOs and banks began, the goal of which is ecommerce, including: it is here that you need to recall the Master Bank, which had one of the largest Internet acquiring services, and, of course, 24 rubles, a cat.  bought the ubiquitous now ‚ÄúDiscovery‚Äù, about which I will also tell in the 2nd part. <br><br>  I will say more: <b>electronic money was finally killed by this law</b> , because  even WebMoney did not agree to the scheme proposed to them, and YandexMoney (unfortunately RBCMoney) with 75% of all giblets sold to the great and all-powerful, evergreen as a Christmas tree and not destroying as Carthage.  By the way, it has been poison for many years that they have persistently and first of all "fought" with aggregators, while creating a competitor themselves, and, most importantly, do not even try to remove the commission from the systems, <b>proving clearly not foaming at the mouth</b> , that this struggle - especially for the benefit of users. <br><br>  At the same time, all credit institutions themselves received such an over-regulated industry that the now not beloved Privatbank of Ukraine could go into technology in a very difficult 2013-2014 year, far beyond most of the top 10 and 20 (etc.) Russian banks;  and the identification process is now inferior, perhaps, to Belorussia, however, by exactly half a step, which nevertheless leads down. <br><br>  Finally, it is this law that, without revealing the concept of electronic money, gave us only a dry and at the same time very complex definition that does not disclose the scope and content of the category, i.e.  <b>does not define its legal nature</b> , but only gives us a <b>description of</b> how electronic money appears, i.e.  <b>talks about the mechanism, not the essence</b> .  For many, all this seemed to be a kind of legal abstraction, until Bitcoin climbed up on the pedestal, which they couldn‚Äôt open at all and therefore were banned: for now ‚Äî in fact, soon ‚Äî by law, in quotes, because  the legal technique of this act, if at zero, then at the absolute. <br><br>  <b>3.14</b> Actually, new, 2015, for me did not become something out of the ordinary, because  it was easy to predict it: and, as practice shows (‚Äúe5‚Äù, ‚Äúsotmarket‚Äù, ‚Äúbebibum‚Äù, ‚Äúeverets‚Äù and others like them) - ecommerce in the Russian Federation did not just go to the consolidation stage, which all confident step walks along the road of integration.  In general, the trend for this state is not new, but at the same time it is not clear why I am so confidently informed that IT and e-commerce are a cat.  she is alive - these are advanced technologies that can and should be developed, and as a result - every industry that is born of this sea of ‚Äã‚Äãopportunities is trying to be trampled, leaving in the world not the best, not the most worthy, but only those in the boat: it doesn't even look like an ark. <br><br>  Essentially: we get new bans, which will eventually lead to new bans (and that‚Äôs what happened: first, electronic money, followed by digital money).  As a summary is another outflow of capital, both financially and intellectually (and that was, if you are familiar with the electronic money market, then you know that all small projects either sold or went abroad).  At the same time, we, as consumers - and in this case in a positive sense - receive products that are only good for controlling the market. <br><br>  I have repeatedly opposed such initiatives, since  By occupation, I always see the consequences first.  Here are some examples: <br><br>  <b>01. Cellular communication.</b>  In our region, they bought up BVK and came instead of it - Rostelecom.  It ended - selling in Tele2 and the collapse of the team.  The second is the MTS and the replacement (polls, I must say) Sim-cards, for which they are responsible in 1 case out of 1000 when it comes to court and so forth., Etc., etc.  At the same time, by the way, the honey insect, the notorious pipe and the embryonic form of egg-laying birds take money from e-commerce and not small ones, but to provide protection and service at the level - it is not, not in their competence.  Believe me, I myself am now constricting with the MTS and understand what I'm talking about. <br><br>  <b>02. Banks.</b>  Yes, I am against the banks in principle, but in this system of socio-economic relations I received (axis), what is around - at each stop, in markets, squares, etc.  - one solid green swamp of fresh and not very seedlings of steel and glass, where there are one for 100 branches, working with the same MG, although the latter pay the money to the first not small ones.  About a commission of 1% percent between cards and so on.  - I will not say, but all this is a fact. <br><br>  As well as the fact that in the Russian Internet acquiring there are only X and a little: Alpha, VTB24, MDM, SB, Ubrir, Vanguard, RS and Tinkoff recently released.  Is it good for stores?  No, because  The commission in 4.5 - 3.5 at the initial stage is a separate conversation that is to come, but this is funny, if not to say that it is sad.  I would rather keep silence about the connection requirements, because I was involved in acquiring European acquiring, including online and more than once faced with the difference between our Rosfinmonitoring and its relatives outside. <br><br>  <b>03. Flasks.</b>  More precisely - their fragments, namely: taxi drivers, fishermen, builders and everything, everyone, everyone who went through the "consolidation stage."  Every time, instead of dispositive norms, the market is given imperative, instead of work regulations, bans, and as a result, the wealthiest remain afloat, and not small and often not even medium-sized businesses.  As a global conclusion, this <b>creates a lack of self-employment of the population</b> and how the state wants to correlate this degeneration with the principles of freelancing (again, in an expanded, but very specific sense) - it is not clear to me absolutely, because  Google and GasProm is good, but it‚Äôs not what I and those who like to live want to do, though not always easy, but always on <b>their own</b> .  Even if the independence is all that means, without an employer or with what will work side by side. <br><br>  PS I apologize if my thoughts seemed confused or out of place: I consider it necessary to say that since 2008 I have been working in this field as a lawyer and every year I have to explain to my clients and colleagues <b>what needs to be changed in order to just continue working</b> . <br><br>  It looks absurd, because  people who are not only willing to work, but also do it day by day, creating different, sometimes not even the most massive, but projects, a cat.  Someone needs them, and they pay taxes on this, they have to adapt each year and wait, what will happen next bad, instead of planning something good. <br><br>  I can‚Äôt say for everything and everyone, but I see it here, today and where I‚Äôm working, and I can‚Äôt help but note, because  words and deeds are painfully and strongly diverged in power, a cat.  most recently, in the face of the Great Sower, she called on businesses to use ‚Äúnewly discovered opportunities‚Äù: <b>tired, honestly</b> . <br><br>  PPS The question is absolutely not about politics, if you suddenly have some kind of consensus: the church, the poplar and the pipe - of course, not what I would like to see, but in this context the essence of the issue in the market movement, the cat.  obviously like to be in trend, covering all of 17 098 242 square meters.  km. ... but in general, it's just a scream from my professional <b>d</b> ears, which has yet to be put on the shelves and get dry statistics, in order to show that in small things is often hidden, albeit not dao, but Zen. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292530/</a></p>
