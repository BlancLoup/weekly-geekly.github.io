      I called my lawyer and he told me not to get upset and go to another bank.  That each Bank has its own troubles and in Wells Fargo everything should work out. <br><br>  That's exactly what I did. <br>  After 5 minutes, I shook the hand of a cute Mexican from Wells Fargo. <br>  She studied the documents and said that she needed a copy of the Driver License of the person on whose Social Security Number the company opened. <br><br>  The fact is that in the US, all people who work have SSN is a unique taxpayer identifier. <br>  I don‚Äôt have one yet and I had to ask my American employee to give me a courtesy and provide my number for company registration. <br><br>  I did not have a copy of Driver License and I was a little upset to go home with nothing. <br>  My lawyer said that she would try to open an account in Los Angeles, there, they say, not so serious requirements. <br>  But as it turned out a few days later, she also failed to open an account for the same reason as I did. <br><br>  The question was how to operate a company without an account? <br>  The answer is nothing. <br>  I met with my co-worker in a beautiful wine caf√© on Santana Row, discussed our affairs and asked to send me a copy of the Driver License. <br>  In response, he said that he could go to the Bank with me tomorrow and be present at the opening of an account. <br>  I was delighted and was already almost 100% sure that tomorrow I will have an account. <br><br>  But the next morning he called me and said that he called the Bank and was told that I could only open an account for my personal SSD. <br>  To put it mildly, I was distressed. <br><br>  But the rule of life: ‚ÄúNever give up‚Äù as always came to the rescue and, taking a copy of his Driver Licence, I went to Wells Fargo. <br><br>  I was driving and imagining how I would get a bank account today.  I imagined the documents, how I signed them, how they gave me the company folder Chase Bank.  As I leave happy out of the office. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the beautiful Mexican who dealt with my question at the Bank did not work on Saturdays and was offered to come on Monday. <br><br>  How is Monday?  I thought. <br>  I visualized the bill today! <br><br>  And I decided to go to another branch of Chase Bank, in the hope that there the manager would be less picky. <br><br>  And you will not believe it, Jessica, who opens a business account for me, didn‚Äôt even ask if I had permission to work in California. <br><br>  As a result, after 30 minutes I left Chase Bank with a company folder under my arm, happy and once again convinced that you always get what you want, if you clearly imagine how you do it. <br><br>  Visualization of success is a cool thing, but about it, somehow next time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145615/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145615/</a></p>
