I‚Äôm doing this translation because I recently started to work with Shape in Android myself, decided to fumble around <a href="http://material.io/">material.io</a> , and found this collection of usage tips there.  It seemed to me interesting, useful, and informative, so I decided to share it with the Russian segment of mobile application developers. <br><br>  It seems to me that this topic is quite important, because the use of different forms for interface elements makes the application more interesting, and maybe even more serious.

      When the user sees some non-standard implementation (within reason of course) of ordinary interface elements, it catches the eye.  In addition, subconsciously, the user of such an application will understand that the developer did not just throw up the components in the editor, but came up with the creativity, invented something of his own. <br><br>  I hope that you will be able to benefit from reading, and it is possible to improve the quality of your applications. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Table of contents </h1><br><h3>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Introduction</a> </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Forms of elements</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Relationship between elements</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">The need to change the form</a> </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Hierarchy of Forms</a> </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Hierarchy design</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Relationship of elements</a> </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Form as a means of expression</a> </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Status display</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Brand recognition</a> </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Forms in motion</a> </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Application</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Dynamic shape change</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">Content Display</a> </li></ul><br><a name="1"></a><h1>  Introduction </h1><br>  GUI elements in the Material Design style can have different shapes.  Custom forms of elements attract the attention of users, make your product more expressive, and improve the impression of use. <br><br><hr><br><a name="1_1"></a><h1>  Forms of elements </h1><br>  By default, in Material Design all elements are rectangular with rounded corners (4dp).  Their shape can be changed by adjusting the following parameters: <br><br><ul><li>  Corner roundness </li><li>  Degree of sharpness of the corners </li></ul><br>  Thus, you can either slightly change the shape of the element, or make it completely different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vd/2x/hu/vd2xhumuuyh-_y0pxj9mxrqsfl8.png"><br><br>  Customization of the standard form of the Material Design elements. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Application </h2><br><h3>  Focus attention </h3><br>  Since the uniqueization of forms highlights them on the screen, they can focus the user's attention on its different parts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1j/ul/m7/1julm7dcztbmrvujbvcl9o75anq.png"><br><br>  This combination of a round button and a rounded bottom panel stands out against the background of ordinary rectangular elements located anywhere on the screen. <br><br><h3>  Identification of elements </h3><br>  Forms give users the opportunity to identify interface elements by meaning, to guess their purpose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l2/ts/l9/l2tsl9yeawy_3idquopewydpfhg.png"><br><br>  Guess the purpose of these inserts can be in their form. <br><br><h3>  Status display </h3><br>  You can display changes in the state of elements using forms.  When using a form to display a state change, use the same form every time you want to display a state change. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h_/um/38/h_um388abpfn33declml-dbgsw8.png"><br><br>  The element partially changes its shape to display the selection. <br><br><h3>  Branding </h3><br>  To give your brand a recognizable visual style, use forms in combination with other customization methods (for example, color).  Small context changes of forms throughout the application will improve the impression of use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ax/az/od/axazodifovlu--rpu31yf3mhf0e.png"><br><br>  Proper use of form elements in the application helps to improve the impression of its use. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Form Display </h2><br>  Modified shapes are especially visible when their contour contrasts with the background.  By default, Material Design uses shadow highlighting to emphasize the shape outline.  Other ways to highlight shapes (such as color or transparency) can be used in combination with a shadow. <br><table><tbody><tr><td align="center"><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rv/ke/p2/rvkep2xmcyvfc5m4zhffzti633s.png"><br></td><td align="center"><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o2/20/mg/o220mg444duw-9kjz0tfgblwygk.png"><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center">  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  The fill color of the button contrasts with the background, making the shape of the button noticeable. <br></td><td align="center">  <font color="red"><b>How not to do</b></font> <br>  The translucent background of the button and its color worsens the visibility of its shape. <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><hr><br><a name="1_2"></a><br><h1>  Relationship between elements </h1><br>  Forms can be used to reflect dependencies between interface components.  Text or icons can help to increase the meaning, but only if the form of the element clearly indicates which way to think. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/my/hx/0u/myhx0umuyek8iz-jizn14bw8vzo.png"><br>  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  The drop-down menu has a pointed angle, similar to the arrow pointing to the navigation <br>  panel, showing the connection between these two components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9o/kl/3u/9okl3u43tis9hhrsorgn8r6jigi.png"><br>  <font color="red"><b>How not to do</b></font> <br>  Refuse to use the form if you feel that it creates an ambiguous presentation.  The cancel button implies a return to the previous stage, while its shape, similar to the ‚ÄúForward‚Äù arrow, creates the false impression that the button takes the user to the next stage. <br><br><hr><br><a name="1_3"></a><h1>  The need to change the form </h1><br>  The shapes of the components influence their perception by the user.  The degree of need to change the shape depends on the following factors: <br><br><ul><li>  How much a component depends on another component </li><li>  Is the component limited to ergonomic requirements? </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p7/cx/ef/p7cxefszeg_jtczehl64i-uywew.png"><br>  <font color="red"><b>How not to do</b></font> <br>  Do not use forms that make components completely unrecognizable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_o/s8/hg/_os8hg-eszfscm5x7upvwn1y7re.png"><br>  <font color="red"><b>How not to do</b></font> <br>  Do not use forms that interfere with user interaction.

These buttons have the same shape with the inserts above.  Because of this, it becomes difficult to distinguish one component from another. <br><br><hr><br><a name="2"></a><h1>  Hierarchy of Forms </h1><br>  Forms can draw attention to important interface elements and display the relationships between components. <br><br><hr><br><a name="2_1"></a><h1>  Hierarchy design </h1><br><h2>  Unique shapes </h2><br>  Components with unique forms stand out from the rest of the elements, content around, and in the interface as a whole.  The form emphasizes their importance and attracts the attention of the user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9x/bz/bh/9xbzbhdua6yfutdkkdpxchqahrm.png"><br>  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  Make the shapes of the components contrast with the surroundings.  The round shape of this button makes it stand out against the background of rectangular elements, and the black color contrasts with the white background. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nl/ys/jy/nlysjy04cfevas8purflb_iurcq.png"><br>  <font color="red"><b>How not to do</b></font> <br>  An element is harder to distinguish from others if it has the same shape.  This button is difficult to notice due to the fact that it is among the elements with the same shape. <br><br><hr><br><a name="2_2"></a><h1>  Relationship of elements </h1><br><h2>  Joining elements with forms </h2><br>  Forms of elements can help the user to understand how they are related. <br><br><h3>  Identical elements </h3><br>  The identical form of the elements indicates their interconnectedness and general meaning. <br><br><h3>  Related Items </h3><br>  If one of the elements complements the other, but is not an exact copy of it, this relationship can be expressed in form.  For example, the acute angle of a shape may symbolize an arrow pointing to an associated element. <br><br><h3>  Unrelated items </h3><br>  With the help of the figures, it is also possible to emphasize that the elements are not connected with each other, and work separately. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td align="center"><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mb/nj/jd/mbnjjdldwwvd5u56whbj-q22rks.gif"><br></td><td align="center"><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d_/sf/pa/d_sfpay-c-c_wuuhtivtujnqfxu.gif"><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center">  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  The rounded corners of the white element emphasize that it is not associated with purple. <br></td><td align="center">  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  Here, the shape of the button in the lower right corner indicates that it is not associated with the element behind. <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5f/no/tc/5fnotc9tky5bubspkh3azft79dy.png"><br>  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  The form and size of the cards indicate that these elements belong to the same group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bn/vz/he/bnvzhelmcvyhf-iz4fppraa6imu.png"><br>  <font color="red"><b>How not to do</b></font> <br>  Do not use a pointing form if the element is not associated with other elements.

For example, change the shape of an element to display its selection after the user touches it, or mark the selection element with an icon. <br><br><h3>  Lack of interactivity </h3><br>  If the element is not interactive, you should choose a form for it so that the user does not think that you can interact with this element. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ne/wk/w8/newkw8qsuwqcfgimd3knmjbuaf8.gif"><br>  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  Changing the form should be clearly associated with the specific actions of the user, or other obvious reason.

Here, the bent corners of the cards just create such ambiguity.  It may not be clear to the user whether the folded corner is an indication that the card is highlighted or added to favorites.  You can resolve this ambiguity in one of the following ways: <br><br><ul><li>  Assign a change in the angle of the card to a specific user action, selection or addition to favorites </li><li>  remove the imitation of the bending in general, but leave the corner rounding if you want to use it as a chip </li></ul><br><table><tbody><tr><td align="center"><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/kg/zz/askgzzcogxuuffk9bmz8cc6kb-i.png"><br></td><td align="center"><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/2f/ye/dk2fyefvjj76llmuyke1hf3qqb8.png"><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center">  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  Use one form to display one state.

Repetitive forms will help make your brand unique and recognizable.  Your application can also use a <b>set of forms</b> with similar forms for different components.  The style of the forms in the set should match the style of your brand. <br><br><h3>  Style creation </h3><br>  When you create your form style, avoid: <br><br><ul><li>  Nemekov on interactivity </li><li>  ambiguous forms </li><li>  difficulty using </li></ul><br>  Mixing different styles makes it difficult to associate any form with your product or brand. <br><br><h3>  Abuse using </h3><br>  Too frequent use of the form, which was conceived as a feature of the brand, can reduce the degree of its perception as such. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t_/2h/2l/t_2h2lf81stb7cwpx8kxbz33zhk.png"><br>  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  Reasonable use of forms contributes to the formation of the visual style of your product.  <a href="https://material.io/design/material-studies/shrine.html">This application</a> uses a form based on its logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i7/kx/oj/i7kxojqhwjval12755c7w2hkoqs.png"><br>  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  <a href="https://material.io/design/material-studies/reply.html">This application</a> uses forms similar to the shape of the logo. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td align="center"><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vy/xq/y2/vyxqy2czap6r4i_o1kkc7xp6o7c.png"><br></td><td align="center"><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-z/km/-d/-zkm-dggppzf0t97ulqsdlpo44w.png"><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center">  <font color="orange"><b>Neatly</b></font> <br>  Too frequent use of one form adversely affects its perception. <br></td><td align="center">  <font color="red"><b>How not to do</b></font> <br>  Do not use forms that are not included in the form set of your application. <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><hr><br><a name="4"></a><h1>  Forms in motion </h1><br>  Forms may change as a result of changing content or user actions. <br><a name="4_1"></a><h1>  Application </h1><br>  Forms change is an event that occurs in response to a change in content within a form, a state change, or a user action.

As a result, the element pays attention to its contents. <br><br>  Using the standard form, you can add a hint (for example, an expand and collapse icon) to show how to change it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ac/7w/gt/ac7wgtn3z1vc7h4-cvrpzjpc3ny.gif"><br>  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  The round button is transformed into a rectangular menu to give the content a maximum of space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6-/ia/la/6-ialayfdlu5kihgcfutzb2-yg8.gif"><br>  <font color="red"><b>How not to do</b></font> <br>  Choose such forms of unfolding elements that are suitable for the content that they display.  This round menu prevents content from being perceived because it retains the shape of the button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ox/6c/ff/ox6cffr7kednla36ydoghssdr_c.gif"><br>  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  The maximum space for displaying the list is achieved by transforming the rounded corner into a standard right angle. <br><br><h2>  Concentration of attention </h2><br>  Rectangular shapes merge with other rectangular shapes, allowing you to focus attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ml/h4/qh/mlh4qht8jalbputjv1jeivqwuri.gif"><br>  <font color="green"><b>How to do</b></font> <br>  When the drop-down list is active, the shape of the upper layer removes the rounded corners, reducing the selection among other shapes, concentrating the user's attention on the filter settings. <br><hr><br><hr><br><h1>  Conclusion of the translator </h1><br>  Well, that's all.  You probably noticed that some moments were repeated several times, and this is true.  This I have removed some very obvious repetitions, which are in the original, but I tried to follow the source text as much as possible. <br><br>  Do you have any thoughts on how you can improve the impression of using the application?  I will be glad to read what you think about it in the comments! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428816/</a></p>
