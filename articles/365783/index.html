    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start with a little lyrics.  The festival took place in the Ukrainian capital in the days when everyone was ready to rest - Youth Day and Constitution Day of Ukraine took place on the same dates as MakeItShow.  Plus from this coincidence that on Sunday evening there was no need to rush home (Monday was a weekend), but you could afford a noisy pastime during the festival. <br><br>  <b>Make It Show is an atmosphere of complete freedom and creativity.</b>  It sounds like an advertising slogan, but it is this short phrase that I want to characterize the rich program of the event.  Fun, tasty, useful, in a company with interesting people and high-quality music - so I want to answer the question of everyone who asks, "And how was it?". <br><br>  The concentration of the most active and creative youth of our country at the festival just went through the roof.  Its representatives were united by science, technology, art, robots, drones, comics, superheroes, street art and extreme sports, open-air lectures and sports shows.  This is in brief. <br><br>  Now about everything in order and accompanied by a photo. <br><br>  The experimenter and the Laboratory of scientific entertainment ‚ÄúMerry Science‚Äù presented their scientific shows, which was especially interesting for the children's audience of the festival. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/976/a41/3dd/976a413dd3c24c7290dffa9dd09043d6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc3/9f5/f3d/fc39f5f3df9e4c2f9080e822fe563a08.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00e/6e2/09f/00e6e209f58c428ca0a188b45ced8d2c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/723/658/d56/723658d5649747748647366c5e0f7fcc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a19/866/dc4/a19866dc42574f879a20525a714dc4ad.jpg"><br><br>  Also in 2 days many workshops on robotics took place.  And the large exhibition area surprised guests with an almost uncountable number of high-tech gadgets and devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc4/992/74a/cc499274a1964173b683b8ed54ca0690.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66d/4d9/2da/66d4d92da05c41128c92c9e41fef1f1c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2d/20c/5de/e2d20c5dee034b5b9c748a5ec5894377.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca4/24a/dbc/ca424adbc1044f91bac074f5be40415b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2f/bf6/429/e2fbf64295b5493c8400b9af27e46117.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, as part of the Make It Show festival, the organizers arranged the so-called start-up gallery.  As part of it, young Ukrainian start-up projects showed their innovations and talked about their ideas to potential customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e61/a22/426/e61a224262f74369b78b1986a19933e4.jpg"><br><br>  As for the partners of the event, this is a series of Kiev art projects, for example, the Center for Science and Arts "DIYA", the Foundation for the Development and Support of Young Art of Ukraine Slava Frolova, as well as the Street Food Festival.  Therefore, all guests were shown interesting installations of domestic artists, as well as gastronomic delights in the food court Make It Show. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46b/f66/4c6/46bf664c628a4da09c7695d0ffc4a35d.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, a light and neon show and a 3D mapping took place at the festival.  The musical scene of the event pleased the lovers of high-quality Ukrainian music: the rhythm of the whole festival was set by the guys from the PURE radio, and at the Big Bang Party on the first day and a concert in the second sounded cool live music. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ffd/a00/3e5/ffda003e50d74dd584c9fe9f9705d2dd.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, at the Make It Show it was possible to meet and take pictures with real superheroes.  Moreover, thanks to the wardrobe on the site, ordinary visitors became superheroes on their own (here it is - expanse for cosplayers) and went to cheer up themselves and those around them in several game bars and lounge areas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/488/8ea/9c7/4888ea9c7a20470395145c068b01e5d3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01e/765/3b5/01e7653b58054511bb7b8210d09a1c5b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/031/434/c8d/031434c8ddba4b3f968d90e0c8786369.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efe/aff/c74/efeaffc74e924b9cba309673606362e2.jpg"><br><br>  For children and their parents was organized a lot of interesting in a playful and informative form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc9/116/acf/dc9116acfab644e9a94621477d1a7dd8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91a/742/8f7/91a7428f7b1a4ac8a7d3789a823a7a48.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/160/929/755/16092975519646caa05b8798e359449c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b38/443/09e/b3844309e95f4084ba0817b0111bce99.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bf/97e/858/2bf97e858bb14094bcac3507e303917f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95e/5b3/d24/95e5b3d24c1d4dca9a22abbe421b267d.jpg"><br><br>  In turn, on our game-site, everyone who wants to ‚Äútry their brains‚Äù took part in the ‚ÄúBattle of the Minds‚Äù game.  Such persistence in the desire to prove that "I am smarter," we have not yet seen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f2/bb6/b5f/3f2bb6b5fe81432daa5797bdc13686f7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6d/ee8/24f/f6dee824f3494d8ab941f35da081f798.jpg"><br><br>  <b>We also share with you a selection of photos with children, which we called ‚ÄúFuture geeks are being raised on MakeItShow‚Äù.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38e/754/ccf/38e754ccf0fa41eca06ee5390f9d2050.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d96/bc3/a7b/d96bc3a7b7c44d37b9ebed12a2724043.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8b/f0b/963/a8bf0b963fb047498a0bb031da6ae98d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14f/3aa/3b7/14f3aa3b74c240daba6ce137638524de.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee3/2f5/a9d/ee32f5a9df0b494e9ee683c9fe9acf84.jpg"><br><br>  Having seen such a considerable number of children at the festival boom, we had the idea - <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/">innovations in education are</a> mega as necessary, otherwise the younger generation will be without interest and motivation to be dragged to school every day, but to receive modern knowledge outside its walls. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365783/</a></p>
