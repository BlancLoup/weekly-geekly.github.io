It is impossible to strive for your dream, while continuing to hold on to a ‚Äúreliable‚Äù past; <br><br>  2. It is better to venture on great things and achieve triumph, even if you have to suffer many failures, than to stay in the ranks of mediocrities who know neither joy, nor suffering, and live a life in which there is no place for victories or defeats.

      3. There is a fundamental difference between the game that you play in order not to lose and the one in which you want to win! <br><br>  4. Even if you do not want to make a decision, in fact you have already made it.  You decided that everything should remain the same.  We decided not to solve anything.  However, such a state is associated with the greatest expenditure of your energy and it kills you. <br><br>  5. Any solution is better than none. <br><br>  6. Winners make decisions quickly.  know that even a bad decision is better than none. <br><br>  7. If you stop growing and learning, then life becomes empty and meaningless. <br><br>  8. There is no neutral direction, so you should constantly ask yourself the question: ‚ÄúIn which direction do I move ?!‚Äù <br><br>  9. If you decide to improve your life by only 1% per month in five components: health, communication, finances, emotions and work, then in just one year you will improve it by 60% <br><br>  10. Even on a TV show, one who does not know the answer to a question does not enter the next round.  Also in life! <br><br>  11. People love ‚Äútime management‚Äù.  It is fashionable!  It helps to squeeze more different things into your time.  But people often forget that ‚Äútime management‚Äù steals your time in which you could enjoy life. <br><br>  12. Very often a person deifies a clock and forgets about a compass.  He catches and saves hours and minutes, wasting years of his life. <br><br>  13. ‚ÄúMissing‚Äù only those who do not know how to use and enjoy the moment and the situation in which he finds himself. <br><br>  14. From time to time it is necessary to stop, so that you will not be carried away by the stream of ‚Äúeveryday affairs. <br><br>  15. What can be done to make today's day more conscious? <br><br>  16. Little things have power only over those who are shallow in soul. <br><br>  17. 80% of earnings is determined by only 20% of your efforts. <br><br>  18. Many seek life where everlasting summer reigns, but the change of seasons is a given and one must be able to accept it. <br><br>  19. Consider ‚Äúwinter‚Äù in business not as a personal failure, but as part of the system where you find yourself. <br><br>  20. As a rule, mistakes are made where work is more complex and unique.  Nothing big you can do if you are afraid of mistakes and failure. <br><br>  21. You can not pour a bottle of wine in the glass entirely.  He is too small.  Is not your personality small for your desires ?! <br><br>  22. The better we get, the more opportunities we have. <br><br>  23. Success makes us richer, but thanks to failure we grow. <br><br>  24. Six obstacles to success: self-conceit, ignorance, vanity, fear, doubt and guilt. <br><br>  25. Three signs of good work: <br><br>  - it gives you pleasure <br>  - matches your talents and abilities <br>  - allows you to solve the problems of others and make money <br><br>  26. Any work can be done guided by the right and wrong attitude towards it. <br><br>  27. Four combinations of "work - relationship" and their results: <br><br>  "Bad work and wrong attitude" (disaster!) <br>  "Bad work and the right attitude" (a little success at a very high price) <br>  "Good work and wrong attitude" (small success) <br>  "Good work and the right attitude" (Success in the shortest possible time) <br><br>  28. Where are you in combinations p.27 ?! <br><br>  29. Each of us is born with a lump of marble inside and tools for its processing.  We can carry it in ourselves, we can break it into rubble, and we can give it an amazing form. <br><br>  30. Knowledge is only potential power.  Moral and volitional qualities - that is the secret of success! <br><br>  31. Socrates considered a lazy one who is capable of more, but stops on what he has achieved. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84650/</a></p>
