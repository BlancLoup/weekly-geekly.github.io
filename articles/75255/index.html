I will give it in part: <br><br>  <i>The life of a mere mortal consumer is a pretty cruel thing.</i>  <i>Each of us dozens of times a day runs the risk of running into (and, as a rule, running into) bad or very bad service, and our ability to influence the situation is usually quite modest.</i>  <i>The maximum that the average consumer is capable of is to break the contract and, feeling like a popular avenger, turn to a competitor.</i>  <i>Swear, make trouble, demand your own.</i>  <i>We are above it.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But not always.</i>  <i>An extremely successful example of beautiful consumer revenge began in July 2009 and continues to this day.</i>  <i>In March 2008, Dave Carroll, the guitarist of the second-rate Sons of Maxwell band, flew from Halifax to Omaha with a change in Chicago.</i>  <i>Dave, as it should be, passed the guitar into the luggage, so when, after landing in Chicago, he heard from a neighbor ‚ÄúGod, they were throwing guitars there,‚Äù his heart sank.</i>  <i>However, the stewardess said that such issues need not be resolved with her, but with the ‚Äúagent outside‚Äù, the agent said that he was not an agent, but simply passed by - in general, the problem, as often happens, was fired, so Dave the guitar flew into Omaha, and Dave flew completely intact, but the guitar was much less lucky - 710 Taylor for $ 3,500 crashed on the way.</i> <i>

The purpose of this topic is the desire to warn other people from the desire to cooperate with these people. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Immediately, I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/regfor/" class="user_link">‚Äôll</a> make a reservation that the main text was prepared by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/regfor/" class="user_link">Regfor</a> , since I had to restore the sites after this story, for which I thank him.</i> <br><br>  So let's go ... <br><br>  I heard many times that you should not use hosting providers in Ukraine (as well as Russians and others in the CIS). <br><br>  But I thought that others simply accidentally came across such inadequate providers.  Now I think differently.  So as faced with the inadequacy of the well-known and, at first glance, a good provider. <br><br>  We hosted several sites (msug.vn.ua, iphoner.org.ua and TechPosters, which we have already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/67858/">written about</a> on Habr√©). <br><br>  The provider has ordered asp.net hosting at its base rate.  The base rate implies uptime 99% and unlimited traffic.  If you look at <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BC">Wikipedia</a> , then 99% uptime means that the site is not available for a maximum of 15 minutes a day. <br><br>  Some time the site worked well.  Not yet been popular.  When the site began to go 300 people every day, that's when the problems started.  And the problems were in the constant departure of the site in - Service Unavailable (comments on this problem can be seen in the announcement of techposters, the site just lay cord).  And since this began to happen all the time, we decided to contact the hoster. <br><br>  On the first ticket in the support we were told that everything was fixed and everything would be fine.  But after a week the site began to fly again. <br><br>  On the second ticket in those support, the problem was explained: <br><br>  <i>Q: Good afternoon!</i>  <i>Very often, when the site loads, the message ‚ÄúService Unavailable‚Äù is displayed.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A: Hello.</i>  <i>When was the last time?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Q: Today I personally caught 4 times. Last time - 15 minutes ago.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A: 15 minutes ago - this means that your site has exceeded the CPU usage threshold allocated for your TP.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Q: Are there any restrictions on using CPU?</i>  <i>Previously, the site did not crash</i> <i><br></i>  <i>more so often.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A: We were forced to deliver, because when it didn‚Äôt stand, because with too much of a load on one user, all sites fly out.</i>  <i>Now, if you exceed the load heavily, your pool is restarted.</i> <br><br>  Those.  it turns out there is a limit on the CPU, but only attendance per day was around 300-400 users on average, well, of course there were peaks up to 1000-3000.  And immediately the question arises.  After all, when hosting was ordered from them, there could be no limitations.  And how can the hoster user solve the problem?  Order them another server or CPU.  But then it's easier to put such a server at home, and not them.  Those.  The essence of the hosting services, as I understand it, is just not to think about the server, the administration, and that it lacks something. <br><br>  After some time, had to turn back to those.  support  But at the same time, many users have already noticed that the site collapses with 3-5 users online.  In addition, the hoster, but they did not know it, hosted 3 sites and they all behaved unpredictably and flew into Service Unavailable, but their attendance was at the level of 10 users per day.  Here is the ticket from those support: <br><br>  <i>Q: I write the same requirements for the fifth time - the site often crashes and issues Service Unavailable.</i>  <i>When there were 5-10 users per day - it was normal, but when the number of 1000-3000 users is already critical.</i>  <i>I tried to allocate a separate pool - the site starts to behave unpredictably - authentication crashes, posts are not added, an error crashes (error page) through a click.</i>  <i>Also read / write permissions were set on some directories, which also did not help.</i>  <i>The option to optimize the site, please do not offer, as the site engine was tested for load testing.</i>  <i>In addition, 4-5 people online can not overwhelm the server.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Please fix this problem, as the current situation with hosting is extremely unsatisfactory.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A: Local testing is not a real use, as we cannot give you all the server resources.</i>  <i>They are limited and when the limit is exceeded, your pool is restarted, which was previously written to you.</i>  <i>In order for something to be like on a local machine, you need a dedicated server.</i>  <i>So you need to either optimize the engine so that, with 1000-3000 users, there is no overload, or go to a dedicated server.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A: We can only offer each site to spread into a separate pool, if this approach does not suit you, then as mentioned earlier you need a dedicated server where we do not limit user resources.</i>  <i>Pool reboots when the load exceeds 50%.</i> <br><br>  The people from technical support apparently thought that they used some kind of their own engine.  In fact, a fairly well-known engine was used - Telligent Community Edition, which is used on many sites with a decent attendance.  But a dedicated server for a site with a regular attendance of 400-500 people a day and peaks of 1000-4000 is somehow fatty.  Moreover, when purchasing tariff plans such restrictions were not named.  And it was called unlimited traffic and uptime 99% well, and restrictions on the base and disk space. <br><br>  Later, extraordinary things began again.  When there was a more or less large load (attendance peaks), then the site worked perfectly, for the next few days, when attendance fell, the site dropped significantly 50% of the time.  It became interesting to ask about this behavior.  Appealed again to those.  support: <br><br>  <i>Q: Yesterday there was a less or less high load on the server - everything worked.</i>  <i>Today there is no load - 50% of the time the site lies.</i>  <i>When, sorry, will it all end?</i>  <i>Please do not tell tales about optimization.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Q: The whole day the site works with problems.</i>  <i>More than 5 minutes does not hold - crashes.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A: How can I reproduce the problem?</i>  <i>We wrote to you earlier about why Service Unavailable can occur.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Q: Why does everything fly in one day and fall in every other every five minutes?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Your explanations do not withstand any criticism - what I wrote to you repeatedly.</i>  <i>Your task is to provide stable hosting, and not to explain why it does not work.</i>  <i>I, as an end user, absolutely do not care about resources, pools, and what you can not configure.</i>  <i>If you cannot solve the problem with hosting, then return the money for it or fix the problem.</i>  <i>I also ask you to give contacts to someone from the authorities with whom you can talk about the poor quality services of your company.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A: Once again, we repeat that the unstable operation of your sites is caused only by the load created on the server.</i>  <i>You can solve this problem by switching to a dedicated server or by drastically reworking sites to optimize them.</i>  <i>There are no other options.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Q: In my opinion, with the understanding of elementary things you did not work out.</i>  <i>Yesterday the site worked steadily with a greater load, today it falls every 5 minutes.</i>  <i>This is normal?</i>  <i>I'm already tired of repeating that the sites are very ordinary, they work on standard engines, of which there are thousands on the Internet.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And only you have some problems.</i>  <i>I don‚Äôt care that you can‚Äôt buy a few extra memory bars; I don‚Äôt have to pay for your problems out of my pocket.</i>  <i>Let's mean a dedicated server for the price of hosting.</i> <br><br>  I need the coordinates of the management or manager.  I want to personally speak with someone who is responsible for the poor quality services provided by your "company". <br><br>  In response, the hoster without warning just <b>turned off the site</b> .  You get up in the morning, you go to the site and there - ‚Äúaccount suspended‚Äù. <br><br>  You come on ftp - and there everything is closed.  And in the technical support ticket with Service Unaviable requests there is a message: <br><br>  <i>A: Based on the public offer, which you agreed to during registration and in connection with violation of the clauses of this offer, you were denied the service and you were given 24 hours to transfer data, after this time, the hosting will be removed and cannot be restored!</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://hosting.ua/ukr/images/stories/docs/Oferta_rus.doc">http://hosting.ua/ukr/images/stories/docs/Oferta_rus.doc</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>2.2.7.</i>  <i>Adhere to the Rules for obtaining telecommunications services, namely:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- do not carry out actions aimed at restricting or hindering other users from accessing the Services, as well as attempting unauthorized access to the resources of the Contractor and to other systems that are accessible via the Internet;</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>2.3.4.</i>  <i>With the increased needs of the Subscriber to the hardware and other resources that are provided as part of the ordered service, the Contractor reserves the right to offer the Subscriber a switch to another tariff plan, and if the Subscriber refuses - to stop his service without returning money and terminate this Agreement unilaterally.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Security Department</i> <br><br>  And they wrote and blocked the site almost at midnight.  Those.  from that time until it was seen 10 hours passed.  But all the possibilities for backup or something like that are closed.  Backup was worth the daily correspondence with technical support, their security department, calls and letters to them.  And in the evening we were given backup files for downloading by reference and promised backup database in the archive but it turned out there is no base.  I had to take another Saturday again with them to write off and bother them all the time in order to get a backup of the database by Saturday evening. <br><br>  At the same time, when I first wrote to their security department, I was immediately told that they said we warned you 30 hours ago and you had time.  Why closed the site, they intelligibly could not explain.  The main reason was that they offered us to switch to a more expensive tariff plan.  But in one ticket and in one correspondence no one warned that if we did not switch, they would disconnect us.  A more expensive tariff plan was considered in context as an opportunity to improve the service that they already committed to implement their basic tariff plan. <br><br>  They insisted on persistent requests to explain the closure with our counterarguments that their lawyer would prepare a response.  He prepared it by actually copying their disconnection message, which was cited above on the technical support ticket.  We did not receive the official letter from the Ukrainian Post Office, which we asked to send us, as is usually done in legal practice.  It turns out that hosting.ua unreasonably disconnected us and we suffered material losses because of this. <br><br>  The behavior of their safety calving is also a separate conversation.  My friend who wrote to them about the backup database, they just <b>put in the blacklist in Skype</b> . <br><br>  If you try to google, for example, the words ‚Äúhotsingua‚Äù, ‚Äúhosting.ua‚Äù, ‚Äúhosting.ua reviews‚Äù, etc., you can find out that our case is not an isolated one and that, apparently, this company has such work practice. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.host-blog.ru/%3Fp%3D391">Here's an example quote from a review</a> : <br><br>  <i>- Abuse Center.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This department deserves special attention!</i>  <i>Here they take steps to detect infringers on the hosting and dedicated servers.</i>  <i>Most of all, clients who rent their servers at Hosting.ua are infringed on their rights - a bit of a violation, so get the server disconnected from the network!</i>  <i>For example, an abuse comes to your server (regardless of whether it is your fault or not) - the abuse center quotes it for you and, for example, writes in a letter that it takes 10 hours to solve a problem.</i>  <i>Suppose that the abusa came at 11 o'clock in the evening and you cannot solve it, but you know that 10 hours will be enough to come in the morning of the next day and solve it.</i>  <i>But the employees of the Abuse-center do not keep the words; they can turn off the server immediately or in an hour (although they give 10 hours for a solution).</i>  <i>All this is done in order to take a reactivation fee from the client - this is a fee for the server being turned on.</i>  <i>Thus, in this department, a business is established in the form of disconnecting servers for the slightest offense and switching on after payment.</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://dmitro-off.livejournal.com/19926.html">Here is another tip</a> about them, here the author no longer hides his emotions. <br><br>  Or another comment in the form of a <a href="http://b2blogger.com/pressroom/release/31377.html">comment</a> : <br><br>  <i>Do not see this provocation.</i>  <i>Read first the contract drawn up by this company (it is simply not there), you will be thrown (do not look at their prices) - this is not a company, but a divorcee.</i>  <i>I am writing why.</i>  <i>The reason is that I ordered hosting at HOSTING.UA, what I was counting on, had to work for the reason that it worked on other hosting systems without any problems ... I chose tar.</i>  <i>plan for 230 UAH.</i>  <i>I paid ... I placed the store.</i>  <i>I tried to export goods to the site, issued an error 500 (as I was told because of the load) 2nd on the 2nd day, you see, my store was closed due to the fact that supposedly there was a huge load there (it was not on other hosting providers) ... with a claim ... I asked for a refund ... I was answered with a letter saying that we don‚Äôt return the money, supposedly it was necessary to read the contract ... The fact is that I didn‚Äôt enter into an agreement with this company, and the fact that they post scribbles on their website (in any the day can be corrected)</i> <br><br>  And here is another interesting thread on the <a href="http://domen24.com/showthread.php%3Fs%3D15a5e599e118e3dde987c4839aed678c%26t%3D727">forum</a> , especially the first post and correspondence with technical support (I would gladly bring here only a bit long).  Our correspondence recalled that we only mentioned there was paid on time. <br><br>  Judging by the reviews and communication with such a ‚Äúcompany‚Äù of a host, this is an example of how not to do business, an example of outright rudeness, failure to fulfill obligations, and the disgusting quality of hosting. <br><br>  The country must know its heroes.  So I wish everyone not to be led by them, and never order anything from them.  As for us, we have already moved to the state hosting, which is what I want for everyone who is hosted by hotsingua.  The only thing that remained was an unpleasant aftertaste. <br><br>  <b>Upd.</b>  <b>I want to answer some questions from the comments.</b> <br><br>  1. ASP.NET technology is not buggy and not slowed down, as one would like to think.  Therefore, it is not worth associating technology with hosting problems.  The same thing about the engine. <br>  2. A small amount of money.  Ie, having seen the price message on the site, the client needs to write the following to the host: ‚Äúyou ask me for a little money, let me pay you more‚Äù. <br>  3. You do not forget that the average client (as I was before the onset of these events) does not know the difference between the ball, dedicated hosting, etc. <br>  4. I want to note once again that nobody violated the offer.  Nobody refused services, nobody loaded the server.  Otherwise, it was necessary to provide logs that confirmed their words.  It is clear that this was not done. <br>  5. About freebies.  For me, the mystery is the fact why honestly paid money to the hoster is called a freebie?  Paid in the amount that the hoster installed. <br>  6. Regarding comments like "but I have everything with them."  This is great, but if I were told that my hoster turns off the power from the outlet and formats the hard drive at every opportunity, I would not stay at that hosting for a long time, because tomorrow it can happen to you. <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7. They rejected my request to turn on the account after two days of inactivity, motivating by the fact that the ‚Äútrain left‚Äù, cannot be reactivated. 48 hours before the complete destruction of files, you see, the wrong approach. If we were problem customers for them, it would be possible to get the money back (and there was exactly one month left, that is, a couple of dollars) and everything would be fine. But they are not looking for easy ways. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">8. I could not talk personally with the person from the security service - I was simply not allowed to talk to him. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">9. I will not argue about the ‚Äúhoster is formally right‚Äù. We have everything as in a joke: ‚ÄúAt the lawyer. - Tell me, do I have the right? - Yes, you have. Can I? No you can not."</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">10. And the last. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"If you expect your resource to become popular ... then take a dedicated server." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I believe that a resource with 300 unique per day is not popular. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And for a project of this kind, taking a dedicated server is not a justifiable luxury.</font></font><br><br>  Bonus: <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They have no money back. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They do not have a test hosting. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, this could alert us, but we need to understand that not all are professionals in hosting affairs, and for such clients like me, such hosts live. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I really wanted these hosters to be less.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75255/</a></p>
