This is a slightly different class of systems for other purposes, but the meaning and rake are the same: we have a large corporate system that allows you to automate / computerize something.  At first, I myself was very amazed at the fact that was voiced in the article completely and completely, namely: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f8/811/cdc/6f8811cdc70888a195fce37b5f4c3e9e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So I can explain from my belfry this article.  Recently, I was at <a href="http://www.itmane.ru/it-manager">an open lesson</a> in the <a href="http://www.rane.ru/">Academy of National Economy</a> with one well-known in narrow circles comrade - <a href="http://itsmforum.ru/part_about/staff/v_ananiin">Ananin Vladimir Igorevich</a> .  And there it was told about different types of projects.  The problems listed by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/joshua/" class="user_link">Joshua</a> are in fact features of a project of this type. <br><br>  This article is a very brief extract of what he teaches in his studies.  So let's say, a superficial glance at the existing problem.  At the end of the article are links to sources. <br><br>  In general, it does not matter whether they are large or not, and even IT or not.  The principles are about the same in systems of different scales.  Their features, depending on the scale and industry, are certainly present, but they can be ignored so as not to overload the article.  Consider the basic principles. <br><br>  There are 4 types of projects for the implementation of information systems: <br>  ‚Ä¢ political; <br>  ‚Ä¢ typical; <br>  ‚Ä¢ professional; <br>  ‚Ä¢ innovative. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d55/bdb/ab2/d55bdbab2de2f3c56d569da37fd8b590.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Each of them has its own specific relationship, strategy of implementation, management, financial component, feature of contracts, etc. <br><br>  Briefly for each of them <br><br><h4>  Political project </h4><br><h6>  Features of implementation </h6><br>  ‚Ä¢ Implementation strategy - ‚ÄúThe system is being squeezed on an existing business‚Äù <br>  ‚Ä¢ Requirements - customer's wishes (uncertain and changeable) <br>  ‚Ä¢ A large amount of improvements <br>  ‚Ä¢ Architecture - ‚ÄúQuilt‚Äù - a mirror of relationships <br><br><h6>  Organizational structure </h6><br>  ‚Ä¢ One leader and everyone works on his direct orders <br>  ‚Ä¢ Generalized planning and poor cost control <br>  ‚Ä¢ Solid team of friends with a full load on the project, loyalty <br>  ‚Ä¢ Informal personal communications and fragmentary documentation. <br><br><h6>  Communications </h6><br>  ‚Ä¢ Dictate customer <br>  ‚Ä¢ The contract is simple and non-transparent (all on a personal relationship) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Costs + ext.  costs <br>  ‚Ä¢ Focus on continuity of relationships and cash flow <br><br><h5>  Brief summary </h5><br>  Implementation is the optimization of a business by solving existing problems.  The customer is the king.  A lot of headache for performers.  Individual approach to the customer.  But the easiest option in terms of entering the market, the implementation of the first project, etc.  All young companies go through this stage.  This is the very thing with which the author of the previous article usually works.  And I worked until I escaped :). <br><br><h4>  Typical project </h4><br><h6>  Features of implementation </h6><br>  ‚Ä¢ Implementation strategy - Conveyor: standard settings and training <br>  ‚Ä¢ Requirements predefined by the system. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Detailed technology implementation <br>  ‚Ä¢ Architecture - Standard boxed local business application <br><br><h6>  Organizational structure </h6><br>  ‚Ä¢ Work on clear procedures <br>  ‚Ä¢ Detailed planning and good cost control. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Design group - machine, narrow specialization, part-time <br>  ‚Ä¢ Formal communications, documentation is strictly formalized. <br><br><h6>  Communications </h6><br>  ‚Ä¢ Intense competition, the dictates of the customer <br>  ‚Ä¢ The contract is a detailed work and supply plan. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fixed price and terms <br>  ‚Ä¢ Extraction of profits from the flow of standard projects <br><br><h5>  Brief summary </h5><br>  Implementation is the solution of typical business problems.  In principle, the customer does not care who the service provider will be, and the manufacturer will have to knock around among competitors.  But if it gets to the body, then everything will be according to the standard, and screwing up additional women does not provide for in principle, even for a lot of money.  Standard office applications with basic functionality. <br><br><h4>  Professional project </h4><br><h6>  Features of implementation </h6><br>  ‚Ä¢ Implementation strategy - ‚ÄúThe business is being put on the proposed system‚Äù <br>  ‚Ä¢ Requirements are predetermined by ‚ÄúBest Practice‚Äù wired into the system. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Implementation technology focused on the ‚ÄúBest Practice‚Äù model library <br>  ‚Ä¢ Architecture - Strongly integrated large-scale business application. <br><br><h6>  Organizational structure </h6><br>  ‚Ä¢ Coordination of highly qualified professionals <br>  ‚Ä¢ Tight planning and good cost control. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The project team is a team of professionals, broad specialization, complete <br>  ‚Ä¢ employment, professional individualism <br>  ‚Ä¢ Formal external and informal internal communications, documentation of results. <br><br><h6>  Communications </h6><br>  ‚Ä¢ Dictate contractor <br>  ‚Ä¢ A contract is a hiring team or service. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Payment of time specialists tariffs <br>  ‚Ä¢ Profit extraction from the brand and qualifications of specialists <br><br><h5>  Brief summary </h5><br>  Implementation is an attempt to catch up with the leaders, to introduce the latest technologies.  The executor is the king.  A lot of headaches at the customer.  A team of high-class professionals.  But a lot of bureaucracy in an atypical situation - since everyone values ‚Äã‚Äãtheir reputation.  A typical example is a certain company came to a consulting office and asks for help to optimize its activities.  Sometimes it can reach insanity in the format "customers read the contract and cried a lot, but they could not do anything." <br><br><h4>  Innovative project </h4><br><h6>  Features of implementation </h6><br>  ‚Ä¢ Strategy - ‚ÄúImplementation of the system - the engine of business transformation‚Äù <br>  ‚Ä¢ Requirements Management <br>  ‚Ä¢ Implementation technology is focused on transformation and business results <br>  ‚Ä¢ Architecture - Infrastructure for business transformation <br><br><h6>  Organizational structure </h6><br>  ‚Ä¢ Search for technical and organizational solutions in tough conditions <br>  ‚Ä¢ uncertainties <br>  ‚Ä¢ Project planning in the context of a business strategy <br>  ‚Ä¢ Project team pioneering team, universal qualification, full-time, team spirit <br><br><h6>  Communications </h6><br>  ‚Ä¢ Informal communications, documentation of results. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Customer and contractor - equal partners <br>  ‚Ä¢ The contract is a framework agreement with the series ext.  agreements <br>  ‚Ä¢ risk sharing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Profit from the project as a joint venture <br><br><h5>  Brief summary </h5><br>  Implementation is an attempt to make a breakthrough, to become leaders, to gain unique competitive advantages.  Neither the customer nor the performer may not know what to do.  But they know exactly what needs to be decided, there is a clearly set goal.  A typical example is any office that has made a breakthrough in its field.  This is the most difficult and risky style to implement.  But at the same time, a possible success can cover all risks by orders of magnitude. <br><br><h5>  Summary Summary </h5><br>  This is a very brief and superficial presentation that simply gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe real scenarios for the development of events.  In fact, there may be a mixture of styles with all the consequences.  In our practice, each of us comes into contact with all styles, both from the inside and the outside.  Personally, I like the most innovative.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/joshua/" class="user_link">Joshua</a> , like I once worked on a project that "optimizes the business processes" of the customer.  It‚Äôs not a fact that everything that is being done is actually necessary, but everyone is happy with everything, since even that small part that is actually needed greatly facilitates the work of other employees.  Well, the rest of the headache is only a consequence of the type of project in which the work is carried out.  In this case, it is most likely a project with a large share of political signs. <br><br>  Sources: <br><br>  <a href="http://mipt.ru/science/NIU/results/umm/uk/3/34/f_fy4m">mipt.ru/science/NIU/results/umm/uk/3/34/f_fy4m</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.pmi.ru/articles/files/20052008_Ananiin.pdf">www.pmi.ru/articles/files/20052008_Ananiin.pdf</a> <br>  <a href="http://bntu.org/articles/management/129-erp-style.html">bntu.org/articles/management/129-erp-style.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.itsmforum.ru/reference/publication/article_13">www.itsmforum.ru/reference/publication/article_13</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  As advised in a personal, added a small mini-question. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172083/</a></p>
