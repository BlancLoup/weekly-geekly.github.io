For a long time there was no such fun. <br>  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2010/tc20100113_231894.htm">Miscrosoft and HP</a> did not have time <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2010/tc20100113_231894.htm">to announce that they are investing 250 lemons in cloud solutions</a> (not bad, but only more ringing than specifics), as IBM immediately opened its card - a record contract for cloud services at the moment.  <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/hosted/showArticle.jhtml%3FarticleID%3D222300937">Panasonic decided to transfer 100 thousand employees (this is for a start, and in the long term - 300 thousand) to cloud mail and LotusLive.</a> <br><br>  Considering that they refuse not from something, but from Microsoft Exchange, the announcement turned out to be such a ringing slap in the face of MS.  Show, just show.  I wonder who will perform next?  It seems to me that Cisco. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  About the agreement between MS and HP, little is clear yet, there is actually no package offer yet, but most likely it will be on ProLiant servers, plus HP‚Äôs system management, and MS, Windows, Exchange, SQL Server, some of their ERP packages and, naturally, Hyper-V.  This partnership did not come to the companies from a good life - Cisco, with its Unified Computing System, was already gnawing at HP and even MS partner channels (although from Microsoft's Microsoft Partners Tsisk was originally further, and it does not have a business application layer). <br><br>  On the other hand, HP had been hoping for a long time to connect with Oracle and make a stack of business applications for the cloud with them, but recently Oracle finally sent HP on a long journey and began to use Sun blades instead of HP ProLiant.  Which is logical - now the goat has a button accordion on the fig, when it has its own iron in it (yes, Sun‚Äôs purchase will not end, but Oracle will have no problems with iron).

      Oracle and Sun - the main threat to the cloud alliance of MS and HP in the market of small and medium-sized businesses, where Oracle partners are simply teeming with.  And from medium-sized businesses and higher - IBM with global partners in business applications, its own consulting division and system integrators partners.  Krupnyak is always too complicated to buy frozen convenience foods, such customers still prefer to integrate the most suitable components from different suppliers. <br><br>  The current contract of IBM and Panasonic, in addition to the record (EMNIP before this, the biggest cloud achievement was that Google managed to drag 30 thousand users in California from the novella group to Google Apps) demonstrates three important things: <br>  1) The clouds are already so mature approach that customers decide on mega-projects in this area <br>  2) Clouds are of interest not only for small and medium-sized customers (as was previously thought, mainly because of the cost) <br>  3) IBM, which did not trumpet about its cloud plans at every corner, brought its cloud services to mind in less than a year.  So here, on the sly.  The contract with Panasonic will change at least the perception of cloud leaders by customers: if before Amazon was considered the leader in principle, Google was strong in the user segment, IBM only looked closely at IBM last year, and MS worked Azure, now albeit not on sales. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80856/</a></p>
