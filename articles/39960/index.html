  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cartoon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So we have a tent and the work on modeling, texturing, rig and skin of the gypsy is finished.  It is time to try all this in action, which means we will animate! <br>  You all saw how expressive the characters of the characters of Western cartoons.  But not only the appearance of the hero affects this.  At least half of the overall impression depends on the animation. <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/f13b5cb5-d2d5-44d3-bf88-9f11ef3e4b37.jpg" alt="2"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For the first tests, it was decided to reproduce the gait and the scene where the Gypsy is dragging his tent.  To understand how our hero should move, we decided to first take a video of the living people who perform these actions.  Then the animator had to transfer the actions of a person to our gypsy.  This is done in the following way: with the help of the control elements, which the character rig includes, our hero is put in key positions, and the computer calculates intermediate poses, more precisely the coordinates of points in the space between the initial and final keys (key poses). <br>  So, for example, so that Gojo raised his hand, it is not necessary to put the keys in each frame, but it is enough to specify only the starting and ending points of the animation.  This property of computer animation greatly facilitates the work in comparison with the classical, i.e.  hand-drawn animation. <br>  <a href="http://teledu.ru/video/2b0acf74-0679-42a0-b71b-b394a0f93402">Here is the first animation ready ( <strong>watch the video</strong> )</a> : the gypsy began to move, but something in its movements looked artificial and lifeless.  He was more like a puppet than a cartoon character.  After analyzing the situation, we realized that this happened by our mistake.  We tried to convey the movements of a real person to a cartoon hero, and this, it turns out, could not be done.  I had to develop a character animation on paper: draw the phases of the movement, so  giving cartoony. <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/c58ecee7-a23e-433d-8dec-75bcd51008fd.jpg" alt="2"><br>  After the phasing was ready and given to the animator (that is, the drawing of intermediate frames between the character‚Äôs main postures), the animator adjusted the character to the phases drawn by the artist using the rig controls.  The result of work has significantly changed.  Indeed, in fact, the general principles of computer animation are practically the same as the classical ones.  With their help, you can easily revive the movements of the hero, make them more natural and, accordingly, more relaxing and sympathetic. <br>  One of these principles is compression and stretching.  Any animate and inanimate object, when moving, is drawn out or compressed, for example, as a ball when flying and colliding with an obstacle.  The main condition of this postulate is to preserve the volume of the object, i.e.  if compression occurs somewhere, then it must necessarily be compensated by stretching. <br><br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/be38e165-a98a-49e5-a328-d59a538c2437.jpg"><br>  Another important principle is preparation or preemption.  Each action is preceded by a preemptive action, for example, before throwing a person must first swing or crouch before jumping.  This principle is used everywhere, for example, before turning the head, the character must first look in the direction of rotation, etc. <br>  Almost always, you should add minor movements to the main animation: for example, blinking, raising and lowering the chest to show the character's breathing.  Dangling lantern or kettle on the cart gives liveliness and natural animation. <br><br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/74148357-f60e-4dbb-93c4-28e212584de8.jpg" alt="one"><br>  The above list of principles of animation is far from complete.  In the following posts on our blog, we will try to complement it and tell you more about computer animation. <br>  <a href="http://tsigan.ru/">The site of the cartoon "Gypsy"</a> </div>
