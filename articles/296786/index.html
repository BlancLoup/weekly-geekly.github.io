      Surely you met materials in the spirit of ‚ÄúHow to create a slaughter headline in 5 minutes,‚Äù ‚Äú100 words that will even sell snow to the Eskimos,‚Äù etc.  In RuNet, there is such a list of ‚Äúwords-magnets‚Äù with statistics (there are words-stimulants even in the official Yandex.Direct help): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52e/a73/c41/52ea73c41cf144c88bdc6fb620cade64.jpg"><br><br>  Allegedly, they are guaranteed to increase the CTR ads.  There is an element of truth here, while it is worth considering three important points: <br><br>  1) Lovers of freebies, or users with a weak interest in the product, flock to the "word-magnets".  Get a ton of ‚Äúdirty‚Äù traffic - do you need it?  An exception is a campaign with a promotion, where a cheap price is the main condition of the offer. <br><br>  2) The lure for discounts and gifts does not work in all niches.  It would be foolish to advertise, for example, "Equipment for the oil industry cheap."  There are other patterns of consumption.  Or a unique product, when consumers have nothing to compare with and the price is considered secondarily.  Basically, these things work in B2C, great - with premium goods.  On iPhone 6 with a 50% discount, a lot of people would have pecked for sure, the CTR took off, but what kind of return? <br><br>  3) High CTR is not equal to high sales.  It depends on the next stages of the funnel - the offers on the landing page and the work of the managers (or the conditions for placing the order and delivery in the online store).  Consider the return on the ROI level of the entire advertising campaign - whether discounts and gifts pay off.  First of all - the cost of one lead (CPL indicator) - how much money you spent on getting one call, a visit or an application from an advertisement. <br><br>  To increase clickthrough, some advertisers put almost every ad ‚Äúdiscounts, gifts, take your time‚Äù, even if there really are no bonuses.  The problem is that the transition to the ad - only the first step, and a high CTR in itself does not mean anything.  At the same time, the decrease in the click price (the higher the CTR, the lower the click price) should not be misleading. <br><br>  Look at the relationship with the CPL (cost of treatment).  This is a key indicator of the advertising campaign (more precisely, the basic KPI before calculating ROI).  "Dirty" technology greatly inflates it because of untargeted traffic.  Ultimately, you need customers, not clicks, right? <br><br>  <b>Competitive analysis</b> <br><br>  See competitors' suggestions, how they write ads, how these ads differ.  Special attention to the leaders in special accommodation: as a rule, there are the strongest offers there.  For convenience, use the competitive analysis table (as a basis you can <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XI0E57qR8t66bnHfmG3rEfzW7Ds9oFmQfg59B0RCwwI/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">take our template</a></b> ).  It will help you understand who and what are the pros and cons, what to focus on in your ads. <br><br>  Let us analyze the competitive analysis on a specific example, on the basis of which the template was created (copy the template and paste your data; you can hide unnecessary parameters).  So, the typical ‚ÄúBuy iPhone‚Äù commercial request: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33b/c34/e55/33bc34e554d24aa6bfde382080407add.jpg"><br><br>  <b>What conclusions do we do?</b> <br><br>  No. 1 - stands here for the sake of branding, we don‚Äôt pay special attention to it.  Apple is Apple) <br><br>  What is good: an extended title, a quick ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù link.  At the same time, the extended title is the slogan of the iPhone 6S release (‚ÄúThe only news is everything in a new way‚Äù).  He talks about image, not about benefits. <br><br>  ‚Ññ 2 - The usual title with the key phrase, where the address of the site is ‚Äúpulled‚Äù.  What is good: a high rating on Yandex Market (twice as much as Apple), and this is a very powerful social proof.  Other things being equal - a strong argument in favor of the seller. <br><br>  No. 3 - Short title with key.  What is good: the title is formulated in the imperative, as a call to action - ‚ÄúBuy an iPhone‚Äù + extension with a phone number. <br><br>  And in fact, and in another case, there is essentially no offer.  The standard set of babble is ‚ÄúQuality, excellent choice, fast delivery,‚Äù which is typical of ‚Äúmarket monsters‚Äù. <br><br>  All parameters are in the <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XI0E57qR8t66bnHfmG3rEfzW7Ds9oFmQfg59B0RCwwI/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">comparative table</a></b> . <br><br>  To be fair, the request is too vague - it is not clear by what criteria the user chooses and which model.  Therefore, we will try to ‚Äúhook‚Äù with the help of several triggers, only more specific ones. <br><br>  <b>Create an attractive ad</b> <br><br>  Take the same request - "Buy iPhone".  Judging by the fact that the specific model and parameters of the offer (warranty, new or used and so on) are not indicated, the user chooses "from and to". <br><br>  Value offer (offer) is based on fast delivery and price.  We repeat exactly the request and get the title: ‚ÄúBuy iPhone.  Delivery today!  iPhone from 12 990 RUB. "Extended view header.  Recall that from this year, Direct allows 33 characters to increase to 56. By the main part of the "catching up" the first phrase from the ad text.  Otherwise, Direct shows the URL of the site.  Therefore, expect the title to get some benefit that attracts the attention of the audience. <br><br>  If you do not want to use this feature, you can disable it in the ‚ÄúAdvanced Settings‚Äù section of the campaign settings: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22b/aad/8b6/22baad8b6a0c439f9231588827d6edce.jpg"><br><br>  We specify 2 more criteria in the text - ‚ÄúRostest‚Äù (reliability, authentication) and ‚Äú12 months warranty‚Äù + ‚ÄúChoose a case as a gift‚Äù motivator. <br><br>  The ability to enter quick links opens in the appropriate tab of the ad editor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72b/36d/ce0/72b36dce04bc4475b4f27277fbfcb13f.jpg"><br><br>  We have links to different models.  Finally, in the extensions enter the phone and mode of operation on weekdays and weekends.  As a result, we get the following announcement: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ce/0b0/e08/8ce0b0e08ba64f54b6246f6bf9a186f8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3 key points affecting CTR</b> <br><br>  From our practice, we singled out only 3 points on which the clickability of an ad depends.  Of course, America will not open, but as a generalization is useful. <br><br>  1) Exact access to the target audience.  This is the question of minusation in particular, and cleansing the advertising campaign from untargeted "slag" in general.  There are, of course, cases where giants stand for untargeted requests for the sake of branding.  But this is a separate story) <br><br>  2) The exact occurrence of the request in the header.  This is the first thing users notice.  Moreover, Direct highlights keywords in the title, text and quick links. <br><br>  3) Benefits or triggers.  We analyze what is important for the audience specifically on this request (again, the argument in favor of creating ads for each need).  Price, the ability to buy on credit or a specific product in stock.  We make a clear, concrete proposal without abstractions (quality, best, low price). <br><br>  For example, in a campaign for a reinforcement plant, they expanded the semantics for exact requests from the assortment.  If a person enters "15ls22nzh", he is 100% in the subject and knows what he is looking for.  We show that we have this position in stock, see the prices on the website: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/247/181/586/247181586933430b93fa6741c7cbad44.jpg"><br><br>  The CTR of this ad is 15.74%. <br><br>  Another example is a car buying and exchange center.  The request is not entirely specific - ‚ÄúAuto Exchange‚Äù.  We make a hypothesis that speed is important for such a consumer: quickly evaluate a car, get money quickly. <br><br>  Announcement: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/469/5ff/171/4695ff1712594a9590fe8503d1f47924.jpg"><br><br>  CTR - 22.36%. <br><br>  As you can see, everything is quite simple: we give specific users what they want.  This is the benefit of analytics and segmentation of the target audience.  And to highlight the ad visually, to help - the following list of working methods. <br><br>  <b>10 chips when creating ads</b> <br><br>  These are the main points that make an ad stand out from the competition. <br><br>  1) Advanced header with benefits; <br><br>  2) Exclamation and question marks in the title and ad text.  You should not put them after each phrase, as in the example below.  Everything is good in moderation) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3db/ed1/a7f/3dbed1a7f51b4ca496990671d70653f1.jpg"><br><br>  3) Advanced mode of operation.  A little trick for offline companies, which we found in the example of Pavel Nekrasov: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d03/e4d/b71/d03e4db71d50487aa1bebf280955b664.jpg"><br><br>  4) Catchy favicon.  In Direct it is shown by default if it is on the site.  Someone specifically "zapilivaet" here such a favicon for selection: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e6/f00/748/6e6f00748246488c915ad70bd205d1a9.jpg"><br><br>  5) Quick links triggers.  We make out in the form of advantages, based on the needs of the audience.  Therefore, instead of the links ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù, ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù and other garbage we collect clicks on what really excites potential consumers. <br><br>  For example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/477/ae3/6ac/477ae36acb9947f2bd298ca3041f71a9.jpg"><br><br>  Compare with the second and third places. <br><br>  Another option: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c26/e79/f37/c26e79f373004948b139ecea4affb68f.jpg"><br><br>  Important: each link leads to a separate page. <br><br>  6) Geolocation (city, metro station); <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e3/c73/48b/9e3c7348b49a47ae9e120b0aaf5b601f.jpg"><br><br>  7) Phone in the extension under quick links; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/902/1b2/b25/9021b2b25b4e47fea43bb2ed8372062b.jpg"><br><br>  8) The cost of goods and delivery time.  This attracts when price is the main selection criterion and you have a better offer than competitors.  By the way, many advertisers intentionally indicate the price in all cases.  On the one hand, this reduces the CTR, on the other - the effectiveness of the campaign as a whole grows, since you immediately cut off those who are ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/682/47a/b8c/68247ab8ce0b4c9189a8a181cd4a04a8.jpg"><br><br>  9) Call in the form of a targeted action.  What should the user do on the landing page - call, leave a request, get a gift?  Therefore, the emotional appeal ‚ÄúPUSH!‚Äù Is better left for the YAN (Yandex advertising network), where there is a different model of user behavior. <br><br>  A good example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c03/153/66f/c0315366fc4445f4b71c4d2e0c4ef5a3.jpg"><br><br>  10) Rating on Yandex Market.  We show when the rating is 4-5.  Otherwise, the opposite effect of distrust may work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/551/5db/540/5515db5409104db1bb78dc570c6d3e61.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Ads in YAN (Yandex Advertising Network)</b> <br><br>  In YAN, we expect a completely different model of user behavior.  Here, people do not search for your product purposefully, especially on partner sites. <br><br>  Important points: <br><br>  1) Attractive images.  In YAN, the visual seems to be more powerful than the text.  Therefore, on the picture-teasers special attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44e/94a/990/44e94a9904c3437385ed5d50f5bbd8d8.png"><br><br>  Yandex help on adding images: <a href="">yandex.ru/support/direct/features/images.xml</a> <br><br>  2) Emotional ad texts.  Up to the headlines a la "yellow press".  At a minimum, the title should cling to the audience "for living": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/218/a8c/b80/218a8cb805134e6396ee9ffb0f3dd208.png"><br><br>  3) Emotional, imperative call to action.  Required with an exclamation mark.  Something that is not always appropriate in search ads, in YAN - must have.  These are the calls ‚ÄúPress!‚Äù, ‚ÄúCome in!‚Äù, ‚ÄúLook!‚Äù As in the example above. <br><br>  <b>What about google?</b> <br><br>  The Yandex Direct technology has practically caught up with Edwards, and from Google‚Äôs unique chips, we‚Äôll note a clarification.  This is an additional line in the extensions, under quick links, where you can mark important things that are not included in the ad text: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/144/b05/d0b/144b05d0b38b4c4abfeb1fda4f089684.png"><br><br>  PS In the next article we will analyze the conversion optimization in the next stage - how to create headers using the 4U method on the landing pages. <br>  Share in the comments, opinions and experiences + you can ask questions about your campaigns. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296786/</a></p>
