After experiencing a great presentation, let's try to take a deep breath and critically examine the new smartphone of the company.  Is he good?  Or is the time of apples gone, and the company has given way to young Asian producers? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ed/24b/299/4ed24b299b9e42ad893a97585819d910.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The presentation is over, the main details are known.  Vasya, exhale!  If you look closely, Apple has very successfully combined several solutions already entrenched in the market: a dual camera, the absence of the usual audio jack, moisture protection, touch recognition, an extended warranty for screen replacement ... And what about the others? <br><br><h3>  LeEco (Le TV) Le Max 2 / Le 2 Pro / Le 2 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b2/d44/7df/8b2d447df41f45c3b35a868cbfe9fe80.jpg"><br>  () Photo mobiltelefon.ru

      The latest line of the Chinese company was <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/news/2016/04/20/leeco-le-max-2-le-2-pro-le-2.html/">announced</a> at the end of April.  Their characteristic feature was the absence of the usual 3.5-millimeter jack.  Instead, these smartphones are equipped with a universal USB Type C. To connect conventional audio devices right in the scope of delivery, Le 2 and the brothers got an adapter. <br><br>  Like Apple, LeEco prepared for this step by presenting two headset models in two form factors: gags and overhead.  But ... Wired.  Respectively, connected directly to the data port.  Otherwise, there would be no sense from a branded DAC. <br><br>  On board the flagship Le Max 2 with a 5.7-inch display (2560 x 1440), Qualcomm Snapdragon 820. 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal memory UFS 2.0, (the top version offers 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB).  The camera module is a proven Sony Exmor RS IMX230 with optical stabilization and a 21 MP matrix.  The same as in the reference OnePlus 3 and Xiaomi Mi5.  There is support for all necessary communication protocols and fast charging, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner. <br><br>  The performance degradation of his younger brethren is not too noticeable for the average user.  LeEco Le 2 Pro is equipped with a 5.5-inch screen (Full HD), 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of ROM.  But the platform is different: MediaTek Helio X25.  True, there is no optical stabilization of the camera.  The base Le 2 is equipped with a Helio X20, a 16 megapixel camera and 3 gigabytes of RAM. <br><br>  In general, despite the innovative connector, smartphones are much simpler. IPhone 7. But the cost is lower: Le Max 2 will cost the buyer <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_356972.html">270 for the base</a> or <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_366570.html">400 dollars</a> for the top-end equipment;  LeEco Le 2 Pro - about <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_356973.html">$ 230</a> ;  Well, the younger unit costs only <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/wholesale%3FcatId%3D0%26initiative_id%3DSB_20160908032243%26SearchText%3Dle%2B2">170 dollars</a> . <br><br><h4>  Huawei P9 Plus </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c01/164/9ae/c011649ae2b749c3b49414f309d747ee.jpg"><br>  (c) Photo fonpit.de <br><br>  Already sold in Russia, Huawei P9 Plus is a version of the P9 with a 5.5-inch display (Full HD).  The P9 Plus has Press Press screen, which works similarly to the 3D Touch in iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. <br>  The processor uses its own HiSilicon Kirin 955. The memory capacity is 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal memory (there is a universal slot in which you can install a microSD). <br><br>  This smartphone model is distinguished from other devices on the market by the main camera module, developed jointly with Leica.  It combines two cameras: color and black and white with 12 megapixel sensors. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the cost of the P9 Plus is close to that announced for the iPhone 7 and amounts to <a href="http://amzn.to/2cruis7">600-650 dollars</a> . <br><br><h4>  Moto z force </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ee/785/209/9ee78520958f4c82b631a7677428fdff.jpg"><br>  ¬© Photo phonearena.com <br><br>  Lenovo's latest Moto lineup offers excellent performance and yet another lack of audio jacks.  The smartphone received a 5.5 "Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, protected from damage by ShatterShield technology and packaged in a thin metal body Moto Z. Inside installed Snapdragon 820, 4 GB of operational and 32/64 GB of permanent memory with the possibility of expanding cards microSD, a fingerprint scanner on the front panel (square button), a 3500 mAh battery. <br><br>  The main camera is represented by a 21 megapixel module with optical image stabilization, laser focus and dual flash: a 21-megapixel camera.  But the main feature of the novelty was the possibility of bundling with additional removable modules.  Among them is a very cool Hasselblad True Zoom camera with a 10x optical zoom. The cost of the device at the start of sales will be $ 720.  The module will cost another $ 250 <br><br><h3>  Samsung S7 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50a/722/4bb/50a7224bbceb4d8e898b9bed14542359.jpg"><br>  ¬© Photo by pcadvisor.co.uk <br><br>  Perhaps everyone is tired of reading about him.  The flagship of the year, upsetting only the cost.  On board, there is a dust-and-moisture protection, an excellent camera, a 12-megapixel camera with OIS, one of the best Exynos 8890 processors, enough memory and a smart 2K display with a Super AMOLED matrix.  True, the S7 has the usual jack.  Yes, and the cost of the gadget has dropped significantly - with the release of Note 7, the basic version of the flagship is in the range of <a href="http://amzn.to/2cruzvf">550-600 dollars</a> . <br><br><h3>  Is there a full-fledged competitor? </h3><br>  When I started this article, I was convinced that there are quite a few analogues of the iPhone 7.  In fact, there are even more.  But each of them has its pluses and minuses.  Definitely only prices look better, even with the Russian mark-up.  The only complete alternative to the seventh generation of Apple smartphones seems to be a Samsung product.  But there is still an Apple ecosystem, and its fans are unlikely to prefer to switch to a similar one from LeEco or Xiaomi. <br><br>  Therefore, the smartphone will still be sold, and not only for its target audience.  The camera has the most logical design, combining tele- and wide-angle lenses. There were always not so many top devices with moisture protection on the market (Japanese devices do not count).  The rejection of the 3.5mm jack seems controversial - but a similar trend is emerging in the market for Android devices (although USB Type C is much more functional than Lightning). <br><br>  Even the cost of the new IPhone 7 can not find fault.  Russian prices still look overpriced, especially in terms of a dollar: the basic version of the iPhone 7 with a minimum amount of memory will cost the buyer $ 890 at the current rate.  An advanced iPhone 7 Plus will cost $ 1,050 altogether. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c82/a7f/862/c82a7f86232f42d0a58d51df3738f542.png"><br><br>  But there are American prices - and they are much nicer.  The official online store Apple iPhone 7 will cost $ 649 for a 32-gigabyte version.  iPhone 7 Plus will cost $ 749.  The cost of shipping a gadget from the United States will be only 30-35 dollars.  For the difference, you can buy a LeEco flagship and decent Audio-Technica ATH-iM50 dual-driver headphones. <br><br>  Due to the anticipated demand for the new Apple product, we continue the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/279922">Pochtoy.com promotion</a> , extending the validity of the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/279572/">previously presented coupon</a> .  This will reduce shipping costs by $ 5.  and the total shipping cost is no more than $ 25.  Even more save (up to 10% of the purchase) will help <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/mr_rebates/">cashback</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397469/</a></p>
