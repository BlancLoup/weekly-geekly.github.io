At the same time, at least a number of media outlets have unsubscribed about this today, but none of them posted directly the documents themselves or the links to them.  What I correct. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e87/f6a/e6b/e87f6ae6b9fbcc206792aae3b7fb91fa.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  In fact, the law ‚Äúon bloggers‚Äù is far from being only about bloggers, it is just that it has become more widely known by the corresponding amendment, which has become regulated, including  livelihoods and this category of network citizens.  In my opinion, the most odious paragraphs of the <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2014/05/07/informtech-dok.html">97-FZ</a> , which will come into force on August 1, is a description of the responsibilities of information dissemination organizers (and the wording of the law includes owners of almost all types of Internet resources and even not only them, but the organizer of the Skype conference, etc., as the fantasy unfolds) to store and provide information to the authorized state agencies on the actions of users.

The official representative of Roskomnadzor, Vadim Ampelonsky, confirmed to ‚ÄúKommersant‚Äù the authenticity of the documents, stressing that these were their working versions.  Another regulation that most interested the Internet industry has been developed by the FSB, it describes the procedure for storing information and its provision to special services by the organizers of the exchange of information.  In particular, we are talking about their duty to store data on the activity of their users for six months in Russia </blockquote><br><br>  Vedomosti: <br><blockquote>  The regulation describes a situation in which an Internet company can avoid having to store data, but then it will be obliged to provide special services with full access to its service on an ongoing basis.  It turns out that in this case, law enforcement officers must themselves collect and store data for the past six months.  According to the source ‚ÄúVedomosti‚Äù in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, now there is no such technical possibility to store these data from the law enforcement agencies themselves, this will require budget expenditures.  Comments FSB failed to get </blockquote><br><br>  If RAEC agrees on such acts, then in my opinion this would mean that our IT lobby has unfortunately not yet formed, which is very sad. <br><br>  Based on: <br>  " <a href="http://rublacklist.net/7868/">RosKomSvoboda</a> " <br>  " <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2485293">Kommersant</a> " <br>  " <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/companies/news/27285971/runet-pod-lupoj%3Ffull">Vedomosti</a> " </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225039/</a></p>
