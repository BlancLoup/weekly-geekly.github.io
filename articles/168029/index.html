So to be interested in numbers, facts, names and dates?  Does this love coincide with the love of Apple gadgets?  If you affirmatively answered ‚ÄúYES!‚Äù To at least two questions, then the free Mactracker application for OS X is for you, because with its use everything that is secret about Apple devices becomes obvious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ef/3a3/57d/7ef3a357d806785f10be5932fa48368d.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  A storehouse of information </h5><br>  The Mactracker app is a database of all laptops, desktops, smartphones, players, tablets and servers that have ever been made by Apple.  For example, you argue with someone about what model number the 17-inch MacBook had, which was released from February to October 2008.  You call the number at random, and you give them - A1261.  There is also a more mundane use - you sell your iPhone 4 to a very meticulous buyer, who is interested in everything, from the date the device became available, to the version of iTunes that the phone initially supported, the application will help answer all questions.

      This is only a small part of what Mactracker can tell.  The amount of information displayed is shocking and makes you forget why the application was opened initially.  It‚Äôs not every day that you can find out information about what was inside the Macintosh Performa 580CD.  Those who are ‚Äúin the subject‚Äù understand that, to put it mildly, this is not a new computer and, nevertheless, there is detailed information about it, from the type and model of the processor to the history of the appearance of the computer. <br><br><h5>  Accurate to Digit </h5><br>  The working window of the Mactracker application is divided into two parts.  The main, it‚Äôs right part, shows all the information about the selected model, as well as a list of models in the selected category.  The categories themselves are located on the left side of the application window, and this is where the paradise for statistics lovers begins. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/342/41a/d97/34241ad97f19092b111c57484903c788.jpg"><br><br>  There are ten basic categories: All Models, Current Models, This Mac, History, Timeline, Desktops, Notebooks, Server, Devices and Software.  The first category immediately opens all models at once in alphabetical order, from the first Apple TV to Xserve RAID.  The second category is a list of all Apple products currently being produced.  The third category is the current computer on which the application is running.  The fourth category is your browsing history.  For example, if you were looking for information about the first iPhone, and then decided to look into the history of Time Capsule, then these devices will remain on this list.  The fifth category is the location of all Apple devices in chronological order. <br><br>  The remaining five categories - this is the choice of a separate group of devices, which after the opening is divided into subgroups.  For example, Desktops is divided into iMac, Mac Pro, Mac mini and other older Macs. <br><br>  The same algorithm works with other categories.  The last category of Smart Categories is a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù category that adapts to your searches.  For example, shows only laptops and software.  Even lower, in the same place on the left side of the screen, is the My Models section - all your Apple devices that you contributed to the application are stored here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f75/c51/cfd/f75c51cfd01c3c688d466f541e79c76b.jpg"><br><br>  As a result, when the necessary device is found, select it and look at any interesting information, which is located in six tabs: General, Software, Memory &amp; Graphics, Connections &amp; Expansions, History and Notes.  The first tab gives us general information about the device, the second tells about its program part, the third tells about everything related to memory and graphics, the fourth reveals the network capabilities of the device, the fifth tells us about the product history, and the sixth makes it possible to feel like a chronicler, contributing your notes about each device that interests you. <br><br>  <b>Price:</b> Free <br>  <b>Developer:</b> <a href="http://mactracker.ca/">Ian Page</a> <br>  <b>Mac App Store:</b> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/mactracker/id430255202%3Fmt%3D12">Download</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168029/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168029/</a></p>
