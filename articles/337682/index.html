  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oracle actually eliminates Sun</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <em>Avoid this trap; Larry Ellison should not be given anthropomorphic traits.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Brian countryrill</em> </p><br><p>  It seems that Oracle <a href="https://twitter.com/drewfisher314/status/903804762373537793">decided to</a> finally get rid of the labor resources that form the backbone of Sun Microsystems.  The massive layoffs affected about <strong>2500 employees</strong> working on the Solaris operating system, the SPARC platform, and the ZFS Storage Appliance data storage systems. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1ae/6a7/ae3/1ae6a7ae30e84bb79b4cfbda3fa6f7c1.png"><br><p><br></p><br><p> This is not an ordinary <em>transformation - optimization</em> , but a real slaughterhouse.  According <a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2017/09/04/the-sudden-death-and-eternal-life-of-solaris/">to the</a> creator of the dynamic debugging system for <code>Dtrace</code> Bryan Cantrill (Bryan Cantrill) this time suffered irreparable damage as a result of the loss of 90% of the production staff of the Solaris division, including the entire manual. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="ot-solaris-do-illumos">  From Solaris to illumos </h2><br><p>  In 2009, Oracle acquired the most severe difficulties in the Sun Microsystems market for $ 5.6 billion.  The company was losing ground in the market due to the avalanche-like distribution of Linux as a server operating system, the success of the amd64 platform, and a vague strategy for interacting with the open source community.  Solaris became open <strong>too late</strong> - only in 2005, and not fully open, <em>individual elements of the</em> OS, such as localization and some drivers, <em>remained proprietary</em> .  Then <strong>OpenSolaris</strong> appeared, but it failed to become a community gathering point.  Whether it was a CDDL license, or the problem was that Sun was trying to manipulate the project.  It is difficult to say why, but did not take off. </p><br><blockquote>  <em>Kicked butt, had fun, didn't cheat, loved our customers, changed computing forever</em> .  Scott mcnealy </blockquote><p>  The epitaph of Scott MacNeil reflects the life of the company in the best way possible - they had a lot of fun, they didn‚Äôt make a fool of their customers and changed IT forever.  It quickly became apparent that Oracle simply did not need <em>Solaris</em> , and he did not intend to develop it.  Then, on August 13, 2010, one of the most disgraceful events in the history of open source software happened - the company <strong>quietly</strong> closed the source code of the OS Solaris.  No official statements on this account followed. </p><br><blockquote>  <em>We will distribute our CDDL or other open source system licenses.</em>  <em>In this manner, new technology innovations will show up in our releases before anywhere else.</em>  <em>It is a real-time while it is being developed, on a nightly basis</em> . </blockquote><p>  This is just an excerpt from the <strong>internal</strong> circular for the company's employees, who naturally immediately leaked to the press.  Here we are talking about the fact that the source code will be uploaded only during the release of the new version of the OS, and the updates will be only binary.  But this turned out to be wrong, after the release of Solaris 11, the <em>source code was not posted</em> . </p><br><p>  For those who speak English, I highly recommend watching Bryan Cantrill speak at a Usenix conference.  The epigraph to the article is one of his quotes, here are a few more. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/733/c82/66f/733c8266f4c04c4b96423f1adfaf69d2.png"><br><p><br></p><br><p>  On the principles of company management.  Left without the <em>wise</em> guidance of managers, engineers gave a mountain of innovations: ZFS, DTrace, Zones, and many others. </p><br><blockquote>  Sun was ruled by warring factions led by atamans like Somalia. </blockquote><p>  About closing OpenSolaris source code. </p><br><blockquote>  <em>This is a NEGATIVE trick by the corporation.</em>  <em>It is because of this behavior that we become cynical and suspicious</em> . </blockquote><p>  On the implications of closing the OpenSolaris source for the new <a href="http://illumos.org/">OS</a> project <a href="http://illumos.org/">illumos</a> , the fully open fork of OpenSolaris. </p><br><blockquote>  <em>We are preparing for the time of the Doomsday in open source licenses, we have such scenarios, they work and it's great</em> . </blockquote><p>  Soon after, all the DTrace developers, the creators of ZFS, the zones command, and the networkers left Oracle.  All development and innovation in these areas then took place on the illumos operating system, where the diaspora of programmers from Sun Solaris settled.  Due to the peculiarities of open licenses, including CDDL, within which OpenSolaris was being developed, Oracle <strong>cannot claim</strong> all subsequent improvements in the illumos code.  That is, it can, but only as part of its own open source project.  <em>Doomsday scripts work as they should</em> . </p><br><p>  For completeness, it is worth adding that Oracle is actively involved in the development of the Linux kernel, where it traditionally ranks among the ten most active companies. </p><br><h3 id="fakty-rossypyu">  Facts in bulk </h3><br><ul><li>  The main goal: to extricate patent fees and fines from Google for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/18/oracle-google-court-smartphone">using Java</a> in the Android OS, the stakes were high - $ 8 billion. It did not grow together. </li><li>  Overall, the monetization of Java failed, Oracle <a href="https://goo.gl/KXTT9W">conveys the</a> <code>NetBeans</code> Apache Foundation, the right decision. </li><li>  Also decided not to run the <a href="https://goo.gl/tCCDoM">Sun Cloud</a> platform. </li><li>  Due to <a href="http://www.bytebot.net/blog/archives/2012/07/20/security-fixes-in-mysql-critical-patch-updates">bureaucratic delays</a> around the security patches for MySQL, MariaDB fork appeared, where a significant number of developers and part of the community passed.  They turned out to be enough for a <a href="http://mariadb.com/">new company</a> . </li></ul><br><h3 id="vyvody">  findings </h3><br><p>  Sun Microsystems is still a living legend and the best that ever was in Unix.

When the lawsuit with Google for using Java in the Android mobile OS ended up in Oracle, they lost all interest to the assets of Sun Microsystems.  Instead, the company will sell software based on its own operating system - <a href="https://linux.oracle.com/">Unbreakable Linux</a> . </p><br><h3 id="materialy-po-teme">  Materials on the topic </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://meshedinsights.com/2016/09/15/oracle-gets-it-right-netbeans-heads-to-apache/">Oracle Gets It Right: NetBeans Heads To Apache</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.linux.org.ru/news/proprietary/13666886">Oracle Mass Reduces Solaris and SPARC Team Employees</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/sun-set-oracle-closes-down-last-sun-product-lines/">Sun set: Oracle closes down last Sun product lines</a> </li></ul></div>
