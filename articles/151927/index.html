  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to monetize the game</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's about monetization of free-to-play projects that you can play for free, but you have to pay for more comfort or opportunity. <br><br>  What is the value of certain items in the game, how to interest the player in their purchase and how the value of the object and its value are related?  A number of questions about the principles of monetization of games answered the resource Pocket Gamer Zoya Street (Zoya Street) from Spacetime Studios, the creator of mobile MMO Pocket Legends.  Especially for Habr, we prepared the original text with the most useful comments from Zoe about the free-to-play mechanics (with the translation of the article available on the App2Top resource). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Some developers believe that in order to achieve love and recognition from the players, it is enough to spend time and energy on the creation of a project.  But, unfortunately, this is not enough.  Requires additional content that can guarantee profit.  Just this can not boast of hardcore games, for which additional content, in-game purchases and downloadable add-ons are not typical.  At the same time in terms of developing the cost of such games will be more, and the exhaust may not come close to the results from the monetization of social and mobile games.

    <h5>  Item Value </h5><br>  The main question is how to give an in-game virtual subject a real value in the eyes of users. <br><br>  On this account there is one theory about social relations, according to which the value of objects is the difference between the representation of social status and its transfer.  Let's see. <br><br>  The representation of social status is a display of some recognizable symbol on an object, personifying wealth, prestige, and well-being.  Well, for example, the D &amp; G logo on clothes - clothes from these designers initially have a higher value, which increases the status of the person who possesses it.  Of course, in the eyes of other "connoisseurs".  This can only happen with strong brands. <br><br><img src="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/FCKEditorFiles//bulls-head(1).jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Social status transfer is when the cost and value of a product depends directly on the costs and costs of its production. <br><br>  In determining the value of items in Pocket Legends, these two concepts were guided.  For example, in addition to the status of expensive pieces in the game there is a cheap weapon - especially for those who want to just play, not bothering about the opinions of other players. <br><br><h5>  What is the advantage? </h5><br>  In-game items offered to the user can affect neither the gameplay itself, nor the ability of the hero, nor to receive additional bonuses.  How then to interest the player in the purchase?  The answer is quite simple - to make this item status. <br><br>  Such items can be much more expensive than others.  For example, in Pocket Legends the most expensive thing is the Almighty Dream Crown for 500 platinum coins (at the rate of: 10 platinum coins - $ 1.99, 2000 coins - $ 89.99). <br><br>  But status alone is not enough.  Of great importance is the graphic performance of the subject.  This most almighty crown of dreams was depicted as a giant head of a golden calf and covered not only the hero's head, but also the shoulders.  The texture of the helmet glittered, reflected the light, shimmered and glittered, it transformed the hero, gave a high game status to the owner, which attracted the attention of other players. <br><br>  The second aspect of the advantage is the commitment to the brand itself.  If you pay attention to the description of the crown, it sounds like this: "For those who have spent an insane amount of time playing Pocket Legends."  This is a direct demonstration of devotion to the project.  It is expensive IAP to a greater degree emphasize the loyalty of the player. <br><br>  For example, in the same Pocket Legends, players have the opportunity to purchase bat wings. <br><br><img src="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/FCKEditorFiles//bat-wings(1).jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Buying the gameplay itself does not facilitate, but the cost of the wings is quite high.  Why?  This item refers players to another no less famous Dark Legends.  And it is here that cross-promotion is triggered, based on brand loyalty.  The wings themselves were inexpensive, but fans had to spend either money or time to earn in-game platinum coins for the bat's full appearance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151927/</a></p>
