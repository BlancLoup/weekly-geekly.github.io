Some models from China cost about $ 4000.  You can do everything with a laser - cut out the enclosures of devices, individual structural elements, apply images to metal, wood, leather and plastic.

      But the presence of computer control does not mean that the operator can relax on the couch with his favorite book in one hand and a bottle of beer in the other.  In order for the result of the work to satisfy all the criteria for success, the operator needs to make a lot of effort.  At what stages of cutting focus attention?  This is <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/05/31/how-to-fail-at-laser-cutting/">told by the master</a> , who worked for quite a long time with different types of laser cutting systems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Preparation for work </h3><br>  Even at this stage a lot can go wrong.  The error can be made by connecting the power.  Or in general, something can be collected wrong, and everything will go to ashes after connecting electricity.  Now many systems contain an emergency "protection against a fool," but anything can happen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f4f/bad/d89/f4fbadd89e1e922844863bed77988b4f.jpg"><br>  <i>So sometimes you have to deliver equipment to the installation site.</i> <br><br>  The problems may not be of a technical nature, for example, the dimensions of the equipment have been badly checked, and that‚Äôs not the case.  What to do?  Disassemble the machine?  Not always possible.  Extend the doorway?  Too difficult. <br><br>  <b>Connecting the hood and cooling</b> (technical project, budget).  For a laser cutter, not only energy is needed.  Exhaust and cooling are also required.  The hood can be any, depending on the specifics of the device.  The shorter the exhaust pipes, the better (if possible, of course).  If the cooling water, requires the supply of distilled / purified water.  It is necessary to think about installing the hood and cooling beforehand, and not after the laser cutter has already been purchased. <br><br>  <b>Noise and smell</b> .  Working laser cutter, its cooling and exhaust make a lot of noise.  In addition, there will be a smell, no matter how good the hood.  The system can work for hours, so the place should be chosen appropriate - this is where the cutter will not interfere.  All this is best to take care in advance.  The hood should really take the air out of the room with the fumes of the treated material, and not drive it in a circle. <br><br>  Despite the advice in the style of KO, quite a lot of newbies forget something, neglect something.  And then, after installation, it can be painfully painful due to an unresolved problem. <br><br><h3>  Beginning of work </h3><br>  <b>Lack of compressed air supply to the cutting place</b> .  If there is no such system or it has failed, then the flammable material with which the cutter is currently working may well catch fire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf1/6d9/8cc/bf16d98ccdc7fee13854ebc698aeec49.jpg"><br><br>  When air is supplied to the workplace, all the vapors of the waste material leave, and the temperature does not have time to rise too quickly. <br><br>  <b>Use of proprietary software</b> .  An inexpensive laser cutter from China is likely to work with its own proprietary software.  This is, in most cases, proprietary software, written by the hardware manufacturer, and with this software unexpected problems may occur.  We are talking about CAD-programs that prepare models for the cutter that are incompatible with the laser system software.  Some files may not be imported, and some - not exported.  This greatly slows down the work, and the problem itself in some cases can spoil the entire workflow.  If something like this happened, you can think about changing the CAD program (however convenient it might be) or replacing the controller. <br><br>  <b>Error in the characteristics of the working material</b> .  In some cases, the characteristics of the material purchased for work (plastic, metal, etc.) may differ significantly from reality.  And then the printer configured for one mode of operation can spoil the whole project due to discrepancies of the material described by the manufacturer and the real parameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba5/0b7/796/ba50b77961153e3abe94aa7f4c5441f2.jpg"><br>  <i>Skin test sample after drawing</i> <br><br>  Therefore, it is not necessary to allow a working sample (for example, to start engraving) a working sample - it is better to check it on a test sample that is not to be spoiled. <br><br><h3>  The working process </h3><br>  We leave the device unattended.  As mentioned above, the operator must closely monitor the system all the time.  If this is not done, the device due to some failures (the most unexpected) can fail completely: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa7/7f2/3f6/aa77f23f6bc92a9e9d54e34fe41c4142.jpg"><br><br>  No matter how high-quality and safe the cutter, no matter what protection technologies are used in it, there is always the possibility of ignition of individual elements of the machine or working material.  This is true even for those materials with which the owner of the machine used to work without problems.  The software or the electrical network of the system may fail.  A servo may fail, or a belt may break.  If something like this happened, the operator can de-energize the machine, and the consequences will not be the problem. <br><br>  <b>Improper focusing of the laser</b> .  In order for the result to be perfect, the lenses must be adjusted perfectly too.  If something is configured at least a little wrong, the work can go to ashes. <br><br>  <b>Surface protection</b> .  The application of the pattern on the surface is best done using protection.  This may be a special film that will not allow the surface near the work area to deform or change color.  Many types of plastic for the cutter are already sold with such protection.  But there is another problem. <br><br>  <b>The inability to remove the protective film at the end of the work</b> .  It is easy to protect the surface, but you also need to remove the protection after work.  Under the influence of the laser, the film can sometimes fuse with the sample, which will lead to an inaccurate appearance.  Such cases should be foreseen in advance, considering the course of work. <br><br>  <b>Unique material properties</b> .  Characteristics of some types of materials may affect the cutting process and appear on the final result.  For example, working with a mirror surface is a problem.  The fact is that the laser used for engraving is reflected from the mirror surface, and the image is doubled. <br><br>  <b>Debris removal</b> .  Usually laser cutting does not produce too much debris.  But still there is such garbage, it is impossible to completely get rid of it.  And if it is not removed in time, it can damage the surface of the material - particles of debris can ignite or fuse with the product. <br><br>  <b>Excretion of harmful substances</b> .  As an example, you should take PVC.  When polyvinyl chloride is cut with a laser, chlorine is released into the air.  As you know, it is a heavy gas, and it will sink into the bowels of the car.  Chlorine is corrosive.  Gas interacts with a large number of materials, including insulation, rubber gaskets, etc. <br><br><h3>  If everything goes well, it does not mean that the result will be optimal. </h3><br>  Suppose everything went well, there were no failures.  But before you enjoy a job well done, try to check if everything is really close to the ideal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b6a/2ed/5f8/b6a2ed5f86c8a11ce8b6129c88e2e198.jpg"><br>  <i>Here, everything is fine thanks to the previous skin test</i> <br><br>  The fact is that some materials exhibit unusual properties (deformation, color change, etc.) during laser heating.  Because of these properties, a material can change its appearance in unexpected ways.  Problems may be of a different nature: <br><br>  <b>Plastic deformation</b> .  For example, a very thin plastic is deformed when exposed to high temperature.  In this case, a relatively flat surface, heated to a certain temperature, where plastic can be straightened, can help. <br>  <b>Sharp edges and burrs</b> .  Some types of plastic can leave sharp corners and burrs.  In this case, mineral solvents should be used to solve the problem. <br>  <b>Contamination of the current working sample with particles remaining on the desktop from a previous project</b> .  You need to ensure that the working space of the machine is clean. <br>  <b>Hidden costs</b> .  Yes, it often happens that the laser cutter pulls additional costs, and considerable ones.  All this the user begins to take into account already with experience, in the beginning most of the excess expenses are formed.  Excessive consumption of material, a significant increase in power consumption, etc.  All this you need to try to calculate even before buying the system. <br><br><h3>  Unwillingness to change anything </h3><br>  This is the most common problem.  ‚ÄúAnd so it will come down,‚Äù this saying becomes a call to action for many of us.  It can lead to excessive costs, unsuccessful results of cutting, customer dissatisfaction.  If you have already decided to use laser cutting as a professional, then you must act like a real master.  For the machine you need to follow, care.  It is necessary to follow many rules for operating a laser cutter and try not to violate these rules.  And then everything will be fine. <br><br>  Well, now it remains to wish you successful work! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395067/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395067/</a></p>
