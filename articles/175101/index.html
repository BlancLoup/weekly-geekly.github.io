But he talked about the marketing aspect (the content is what people buy), and when working with search engines it is also necessary to take into account the technical aspect (the content is what allows you to get into first places in the results for certain search queries).  Fortunately, search engine algorithms have already moved from the cave stage of consuming ‚Äúair conditioner to buy inexpensive price setting hitachi air conditioners‚Äù spells to the civilized requirements for web page texts. <br><br>  In this article we will try to describe the current preferences of search engines and the pitfalls that almost every site owner will encounter when filling pages with texts and other content. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  What content do not like search engines </h4><br>  <i>Mushi key words.</i>  A classic anecdote: ‚ÄúHow many SEOs do you need to turn a 60 W incandescent bulb into a light bulb to buy inexpensively without an SMS‚Äù.  Previously, it worked, and it was used.  Now it is definitely harmful and even dangerous: search engine algorithms classify such texts as spam and impose appropriate sanctions on the pages. <br><br>  <i>Sheets</i>  A few years ago, only pages with giant panels of densely optimized texts - signs of 25000-50000 could get a place in the TOP10 on highly competitive topics.  It was a bug of Yandex - roughly speaking, in the ranking formula, this variable received an unreasonably great importance (it is possible that some of the developers decided that only good websites would write long original subject articles).  Despite the short duration of the page-sheet rule, this episode was imprinted in the mass consciousness.  There is no need to do this - there are no strict restrictions on the amount of content, but it should certainly be designed for visitors to read and understand, and not for robots. <br><br>  <i>Unstructured.</i>  The text should be divided into blocks - both structurally (with headings of levels &lt;H1-H6&gt;) and visually.  Text blocks should be illustrated with high quality and accurate: not only does ‚Äúpicture + text‚Äù attract several times more attention, but it also forces the search engine, other things being equal, to consider this content to be more worthwhile than a long treatise without paragraphs, subtitles and illustrations.  Beautiful placement of content on the page relates to the field of design and requires great efforts, a classic example is the Apple site.  But it is worth it, even if it does not have a significant impact on the position: traffic can be bought, conversion - never. <br><br>  <i>Duplication.</i>  On pages within the same site there will always be duplicate elements both in the code and in the content, but try to minimize this.  For example, it is not necessary on the page of each product category and each product to inform the visitor with the same copied phrases that he is ‚Äúin the best in the internal feuds and adjacent lands of the online store of wasp honey and granite stools ultramatreshka.com‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>Borrowed content.</i>  If the search engine knows that the content posted on the site (especially the text) is taken from another site, and even without reference to the source, the punishing finger will inevitably draw ‚Äúmene, tekel, fares‚Äù.  And with the positions in the near future everything will be very bad.  At this point, many people have questions, which we will try to answer below. <br><br><h4>  Original content and its protection </h4><br>  <i>I have an assortment of goods around the gazillion, how do you want to make original descriptions?</i>  <i>I will parse them from the sites of manufacturers.</i> <br>  - Features really can be taken from the sites of manufacturers.  Put links to the original pages.  And still try to make the original text descriptions in addition to the characteristics, especially if you want to promote the pages of specific products in the issuance of the corresponding low frequency.  This method works well: put a block of reviews or comments on the pages, try to convince users to write something about the products (this will surely be a unique description). <br><br>  <i>I'm thinking of taking almost all of the content from the supplier‚Äôs site, but on each page I‚Äôll put a link to the source.</i>  <i>Will it work?</i> <br>  - You will help the supplier site more than your own.  This is better than just copying without a link (i.e., stealing), but it is unlikely to get into TOP-10 by any competitive demand.  First, search engines prefer to show users original and diverse content, two copies will not fall into the top ten, the original source will go there.  Secondly, weight leaks through links, which makes your pages and the site as a whole less authoritative.  Try to get links, not distribute them. <br><br>  <i>All the content on my site was written by me and my grandmother, the soul was invested!</i>  <i>How to protect him from abduction?</i> <br>  - The question is correct, you are obviously familiar with the topic!  Although search engines are constantly increasing the speed of indexing and the algorithms for determining primary sources, the mechanism sometimes still fails.  It is better not to rely on machine intelligence completely, but to help the robot a little.  Everything is quite simple: when placing text on a page, you need to go to <a href="">the Yandex.Webmaster</a> service <a href="">to download the original texts</a> and confirm the rights.  There <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/webmaster/%3Fid%3D1120756">is a detailed help there</a> , although the step-by-step wizard himself is unlikely to cause difficulties.  Do not be lazy - it will be much more difficult to get out from under undeserved sanctions or simply to lose ground if your texts are quickly copied by an authoritative resource, and the search engine considers it to be the primary source.  For Google, the mechanism is a little different: texts need to be <a href="https://plus.google.com/authorship">linked to a Google+ profile</a> , and also read the <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26answer%3D1408986%26expand%3Doption2">corresponding page in the help</a> .  There is another method: buy on the protected page a few inexpensive links with long anchors taken from the protected content.  Try to apply it, if the official methods will not be enough to neutralize the annoying thieves of content. <br><br>  <i>I bought in the stall at the subway a unique synonymizer on the Markov chains ‚ÄúBrothers-kontenuha‚Äù.</i>  <i>Checkmate, atheists!</i> <br>  - Search engines quite cleverly recognize the content passed through such meat grinders, and they consider it as black optimization (black hat SEO) and punish with a ban.  A decent website of this business should not be shown in the TOP by such methods.  In addition, there is hardly a potential buyer who will like it.  You can experiment with any techniques, but, let's repeat, black SEO cannot have anything to do with business and sales of normal products and normal services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175101/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175101/</a></p>
