But behind the scenes, the most important thing remains - what kind of advertisement should be in order to interest the buyer, encourage him to click and go to the site, and even with a low bounce rate.  Our experience shows that advertisers are often addicted to and compete in copywriting skills rather than satisfying a user's request.  Therefore, today we will tell you how to deal with fantasy for the benefit of high-quality advertising.  Namely - how to create a good, working, ad. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8b/956/50f/a8b95650f81e46f98be77d45a700f90d.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is hardly possible to find an advertiser or a marketer who did not sigh above the CTR value (click-through rate), which is defined as the ratio of the number of clicks on an advertisement to the number of impressions and is measured in percent.  In general, the higher the CTR, the more successful the ad and the more it meets the user's expectations.  There are several sure ways to raise the CTR value. <br><br>  Short text ads contextual advertising - a huge temptation to use the maximum imagination to create text.  Often, this plays with the advertisers a cruel joke - an irrelevant ad is obtained, which does not correspond to the user's requests, and sometimes to keywords.  This is doubly unfavorable for the fact that such an ad increases the cost of a click.  For example, a company sells soft toys and wants to appear by the keywords "soft toys" and "buy a soft toy."  The advertising manager creates the first ad.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a47/da4/07d/a47da407d06c4cab86f5b9907c9614ac.png"><br>  It seems to be consistent with the subject, contains a pleasant text and quite creative.  However, the cost per click does not suit the advertiser at all.  The manager takes a few more iterations and creates ads, <b>thinking not about the level of creativity, but about CTR - the indicator of clickability of the advertisement.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20f/257/975/20f257975bf54bb5baf03c0ac050db79.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d86/17d/694/d8617d6942f24739bc353ad2ad2952f9.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/331/d89/d28/331d89d28fd242fd9c9133c4474e1a16.png"><br>  As you can see, at the expense of properly organizing the ad text, we managed to reduce the cost of a click by 2-3 times.  For this were used common techniques. <br><br><ul><li>  Mention the keyword in the title and in the ad text.  At the same time, despite the fact that Yandex speaks and understands Russian very well, it is best to take into account the morphology of the word.  Well, in bad-to-speak Russian Google morphology should be taken into account and even more so. <br><br></li><li>  Indication of the price (the index of the price range, discounts as a percentage and the expiration date of the action / offer) also have a similar effect. <br></li></ul><br>  These two simple steps will save considerable funds and increase the click-through rate of ads, because, firstly, these ads will be shown in higher positions, and secondly, they will contain information that is useful to the user. <br><br>  The next way to increase clickability is <b>to select keywords that are as similar as possible to search queries.</b>  To do this, using various tools ( <a href="https://wordstat.yandex.ru/"><b>WordStat</b></a> , Google Keyword Tools in AdWords), you need to select medium and low-frequency words for your requests and generate ads for them.  If your topic is very common, look at what the search engines give out by the first words - this information generally reflects requests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81b/26a/346/81b26a346849406f9b2625fc3c300ce5.png"><br><br>  Do not superfluous to see the hint under the search results - from it you can get additional ideas for the keyword pool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e7/7a5/6dc/5e77a56dc3e34edeb5b36c42869c40bc.png"><br><br>  If you have two similar keywords, but you don‚Äôt know which one is used more often, you can turn to another popular free tool - <a href="https://www.google.ru/trends/">Google Trends</a> .  This service allows you to select the period of interest (since 2004), the country, the Google search service and from this find out what was more popular with users, when there are peaks of interest and what kind of popularity prediction is expected.  For example, so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/313/dda/125/313dda1251154f27b903eeacee4a598f.png"><br><br>  Once you have typed enough keywords and started generating ads based on the semantic core of your advertising campaign, you can use several more ways to increase clickability. <br><br>  <b>Use words that attract the attention of</b> customers <b>and motivate</b> them to buy: <em>discount, sale, reduced price, only up to, only in May, your personal discount</em> .  Remember that among these words may be words that can visually devalue your offer: <em>coupon, cheap, free, grab, freebie</em> .  Choosing motivation, you need to remember about your target audience, and about the product profile: luxury brands require one word, and a favorable telephone rate for students - completely different. <br><br>  <b>Create a unique selling proposition</b> , even if you don‚Äôt have one.  To do this, you need to add the attributes of the extended offer in your ad: <em>1 year warranty, we will refund the money, a set of rubber as a gift and so on.</em> Such words do not devalue the offer, but instead give an additional value load and separate the ad from the competitor's offers. <br><br>  <b>Remember about geography.</b>  Here it is worth talking about two aspects.  Geo-targeting - create ad groups for different regions, if you are represented in them.  The point is not so much that the stakes on the same keyword in Moscow and regions may differ significantly.  The fact is that the mention of regional features will increase the clickability.  <em>For example, you sell inflatable boats in Saratov, Moscow and Penza.</em>  <em>Accordingly, you can create an ad ‚ÄúInflatable boats in / region /.</em>  <em>Inflatable boats for those who like to rest on / name of the river depending on the region: Volga, Moscow River, Sura /. ‚Äù</em> This is where the second aspect appears - the user sees a familiar name that coincides with his interest and is more willing to go to the advertiser‚Äôs website. <br><br>  <b>Brand keywords.</b>  There is a widespread belief that branded keywords exist only for those whose brand is known.  This statement is not quite true, so you may have a regional brand or industry, which is known to your potential client, but is unknown to the entire Runet.  Use the company name or product name to bring to the site exactly those who are interested in you.  An additional advantage of this approach is the adjustment from a competitor by direct reference to the advertiser. <br><br>  <b>Create ads with the maximum set of extensions:</b> in Yandex.Direct, these are additional links, address and phone number, work time, images in ads for YAN;  in Google AdWords, these are additional links, add-ons (main words through dot-sharing), social extensions and reviews for large companies, telephone.  Among these additions are the most valuable additional links in which you can directly specify the desired sections of the site (price, reviews, promotion).  This is what an ad on Google might look like. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/555/eb2/dae/555eb2dae2064d23ac1724d683c2f64f.png"><br><br>  However, in this form of ads are shown only in the first position. <br><br>  <b>Use negative keywords.</b>  They will allow you to restrict impressions on irrelevant queries and avoid empty clicks.  Negative words include both universal ( <em>abstract, coursework, dissertation, review</em> ), and industry, as well as words from overlapping ad groups.  Be careful in choosing negative keywords - you can close valuable keywords. <br><br>  <b>Do not forget to use banner advertising.</b>  If Yandex has display advertising everything is difficult and expensive, then Google suggests using banners in almost all types of advertising campaigns.  Obviously, you can graphically convey much more information.  It‚Äôs especially difficult to overestimate the importance of banners for remarketing campaigns and campaigns on the Google Display Network. <br><br>  There are many more ways to increase clickability: dynamic inserts, templates, time-limited advertising, fake display URL.  Literally every advertising agency or large independent advertiser has its own secrets for managing user clicks.  We at <a href="http://www.realweb.ru/"><b>RealWeb have</b></a> compiled a small list of general recommendations. <br><br><ul><li>  Do not write machine language.  Your users are simple people who want to see what they are looking for.  The more humanity in your ad, the more it mimics the search results. <br><br></li><li>  Do not overuse dynamic inserts if you are not sure of the syntax and consistency of the text and the insert. <br><br></li><li>  Try to customize the match between keywords, ad text and the content of the landing page or landing page. <br><br></li><li>  Avoid jargon, bureaucratism and familiarity in ads if this does not imply your product or audience. <br><br></li><li>  Do not write one-syllable ads from the category of <em>‚ÄúChair.</em>  <em>Sofa.</em>  <em>From a warehouse in Moscow.</em>  <em>Inexpensive.</em>  <em>Call. "</em>  Such ads no longer attract attention. <br><br></li><li>  Automate the ad generation process correctly: use Direct.Commander, offline AdWords editor, well, or like us, <a href="http://garpun.com/"><b>Garpun</b></a> . <br></li></ul><br>  Do not forget that not only the ad itself is important, but also the page to which it leads.  If it has an unfriendly interface, describes a completely different product and misleads the user, all you get is a large percentage of failures, even with a good CTR.  Therefore, create advertising in the complex, working through every detail and optimizing landing pages.  But that's another story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295346/</a></p>
