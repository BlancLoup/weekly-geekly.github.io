In this article I want to share with you my personal experience in preparing and successfully passing the three mandatory exams for acquiring the CCNP certificate. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As a preamble, I want to warn you that we will talk about exams valid until <b>January 29th, 2015</b> .  After this date, you will need to submit their updated versions (you can read about the differences <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/231547/">here</a> ).  Despite this, the strategy and sources of information (meaning their updated versions) remain unchanged. <br><br>  I will begin, perhaps, from my home setup, and then I will move on to a phased description of the preparation process for each exam. <br><br>  And so, my home laboratory consists of: <br><ul><li>  2 x Cisco 3560 </li><li>  4 x Cisco 2950 </li><li>  Old Pentium 4 based PC with 256MB RAM </li><li>  USB-to-Ethernet network cards </li><li>  4 port serial-to-USB adapter </li><li>  Remote Power Management Cards </li><li>  Racks of own production </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">It looks like this:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3d/95b/761/a3d95b7613164253a4a8d4b9e8378f48.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c83/fb8/8d3/c83fb88d3e27458e8d658ff0dd553322.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a15/cdc/4b3/a15cdc4b335e493d9e29dbf464b79faf.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bef/a39/c08/befa39c082b842fc9c9a661485a32882.JPG"><br></div></div><br>  The PC serves as a console server based on a ubuntu-like Linux, with an adapter of serial ports connected from it, from which 4 cables run to the console ports of the switches (only 4 of the 6 are used).  Communication with serial ports is provided by the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ser2net/">ser2net</a> application.  Also, the PC contains virtual machines based on <a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/">TinyCore</a> miniature linux images for use as clients / hosts;  they connect to switch ports through the network interfaces of external USB-to-Ethernet cards.  In the appendage, all this stuff is controlled by power using the IP relyushek card, thereby providing the ability to remotely start the system.

      Let's go directly to the exams themselves. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccnp/route">CCNP ROUTE 642-902</a> </h4><br>  In my humble opinion, it is necessary to begin with it, since understanding the principles of the routing protocols, as well as redistribution and route manipulation, will greatly facilitate the preparation for the second exam, which will be discussed later. <br><br><h5>  Information sources </h5><br>  <b>1.</b> <a href="http://www.ciscopress.com/store/implementing-cisco-ip-routing-route-foundation-learning-9781587058820">Implementing Cisco IP Routing (ROUTE) Foundation Learning Guide</a> - the book provides comprehensive knowledge on each topic.  Volume chapters help to study in detail the work of all major protocols.  Read it first. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> <a href="http://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccnp-route-642-902-official-certification-guide-premium-9780133260823">CCNP ROUTE 642-902 Official Certification Guide</a> - this book somewhat repeats the first one, but the material in it is presented in a more condensed form.  It allows you to update the memory in a short time on topics read in the first book.  Each chapter is given a list of test questions, with the correct answer to which the reader may skip the chapter ( <i>not recommended</i> ).  Also, the author shares in it in simple ways of memorizing certain difficult moments, such as, for example, BGP Best Path Selection using mnemonics.  I recommend the purchase of the Premium version, since it includes a test exam from Boson. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> <a href="http://gns3vault.com/product/master-ccnp-route/">How to Master CCNP ROUTE</a> is an excellent little book from the independent expert Ren√© Molenaar, where everything that a candidate needs to know is explained with a simple language and with a bunch of examples and listings.  Keep it handy. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> <a href="http://www.cisco.com/cisco/web/psa/default.html">Cisco online documentation</a> - unfortunately, during the exam come across tricky questions, the answers to which are not covered in the entire book.  In order not to lose extra points, I recommend that you often refer to the Cisco documentation to clarify the subtleties of the mechanisms, as well as to consolidate the material covered. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> <a href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/index.jspa">The Cisco Learning Network portal</a> is a major Cisco learning forum.  Contains a huge number of topics.  If you have found the answer to your question, feel free to create a new topic.  There are plenty of people there, many of them are ready to come to your aid.  Also, the forum contains a large amount of documentation.  The main thing is not to be lazy to use the search. <br><br>  <b>6.</b> <a href="http://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccnp-route-642-902-quick-reference-9781587143380">CCNP ROUTE 642-902 Quick Reference</a> - all the most important things to remember about before entering the examination room. <br><br><h5>  From theory to practice </h5><br>  Having finished reading, we proceed to practical exercises.  In fact, if possible, it is better to alternate theory with work in the console. <br>  My main tools were GNS3 and PacketTracer version 6.1 simulators.  The advantage of the first, as you know, is the ability to work with real IOS images.  This gives you confidence that the device works exactly as the manufacturer intended!  In PacketTracer, on the other hand, there are too many critical bugs, and the devices themselves often do not behave like their real counterparts, therefore, GNS3 was chosen as my main lab environment.  I used PT only in cases when it was necessary to quickly test a small config. <br><br>  I took laboratory tasks from the collection CCNP ROUTE 6.0 SLM ( <i>Student Lab Manual</i> ).  The document is intended for students attending official Cisco courses, but it is easy to find on the network for free access.  In addition, <a href="http://gns3vault.com/labs/">the</a> Rene Molenaar <a href="http://gns3vault.com/labs/">website</a> contains a large number of labs with ready-made configs for downloading to GNS3 ( <i>version 1.x required</i> ). <br><br><h5>  How much time is required </h5><br>  It took me about three months to complete my training.  I diligently read the first two, occasionally playing with the console, and the last month was spent on repetition of the material and practical exercises.  The exam was passed on the first attempt. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccnp/switch%3Ftab%3Doverview">CCNP SWITCH 642-813</a> </h4><br>  In my opinion, the most difficult and costly exam in finance.  Its complexity lies in a clear understanding of the work of all small <s>cogs and grooves of the</s> components that underlie switching technologies.  In addition, it also requires knowledge accumulated in preparation for the previous exam.  The financial side of the issue is also not happy, because for practical exercises you need to buy real hardware (of <i>course, if you can get it for yourself for a while, you will save a lot of money</i> ).  Yes, by the way, in GNS3 versions 1.x there was support for IOU switches, but I honestly did not try to use them.  If you have experience with them, share. <br><br><h5>  Information sources </h5><br>  <b>1.</b> <a href="http://www.ciscopress.com/store/implementing-cisco-ip-switched-networks-switch-foundation-9781587058844">Implementing Cisco IP Switched Networks (SWITCH) Foundation Learning Guide</a> is the same as in the case of ROUTE, but with the only difference that here this book rather complements the second one in this series. <br>  <b>2.</b> <a href="http://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccnp-switch-642-813-official-certification-guide-premium-9780133260816">CCNP SWITCH 642-813 Official Certification Guide</a> - in this book you will find what is missing in the first one, and vice versa.  So, we read both carefully.  To purchase again recommended Premium version with tests. <br>  <b>3.</b> <a href="http://gns3vault.com/product/master-ccnp-switch/">How to Master CCNP SWITCH</a> - to facilitate difficult-to-digit sections. <br>  <b>4.</b> Articles by Peter Lopukhov in the INE blog on STP / RSTP / MSTP: <a href="http://blog.ine.com/2010/04/05/understanding-stp-and-rstp-convergence/">tyts</a> and <a href="http://blog.ine.com/2010/02/22/understanding-mstp/">tyts</a> . <br>  <b>5.</b> By itself, the online documentation and CLN forum. <br>  <b>6.</b> <a href="http://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccnp-switch-642-813-quick-reference-9781587143670">CCNP SWITCH 642-813 Quick Reference</a> <br>  Brochure - crib. <br><br><h5>  From theory to practice </h5><br>  The SWITCH theory is quite voluminous, replete with a large number of important details and complex algorithms that require the reader to have a clear understanding of the operation of the whole system.  One of the most difficult topics is STP, most of the exam questions have been compiled on it.  To understand how this protocol works, you can only thoroughly examine it on real equipment, resorting to the help of the built-in debugging in IOS and external traffic analyzers, like <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> .  Spend as much time as possible in the console, in particular, study the STP reaction to certain events.  Learn to distribute the roles of bridges in your mind, as well as the state of the ports. <br>  Laboratory work can be found all on the same <a href="http://gns3vault.com/labs/">site</a> , as well as from the collection CCNP SWITCH 6.0 SLM (Student Lab Manual). <br><br><h5>  How much time is required </h5><br>  It took me about two and a half months to read, and another 15 days to complete final preparation before the exam.  It was possible to pass on the first attempt. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccnp/tshoot">TSHOOT 642-832</a> </h4><br>  It's time to take a break in the truest sense of the word.  We have reached the easiest, and sometimes even enjoyable, exam.  Here you will not have to learn something fundamentally new, with the exception of a couple of monitoring protocols and a small introductory chapter on methods of preventing and identifying problems in networks.  But to repeat the material passed previous exams will be very helpful.  This will help you brochures Quick Reference, which I mentioned above. <br>  In addition, the exam itself is not similar to the previous ones;  there are practically no usual questions with one or multiple choice, drag-n-shots and all sorts of symlets.  On the contrary, you will be prompted to troubleshoot problems described in the style of troubles (incidents).  How it looks, you can understand, having worked in the free demo version of the exam <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le2/le37/le10/tshoot_demo.html">here</a> . <br><br><h5>  Information sources </h5><br>  <b>1.</b> <a href="http://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccnp-tshoot-642-832-official-certification-guide-premium-9780133260847">CCNP TSHOOT 642-832 Official Certification Guide</a> - author of the book Kevin Wallace claims that he compiled the book in such a way that the reader could just remember all the important points and learn how to independently identify and eliminate the causes of problems.  To do this, at the end of each chapter contains a structured scenario of the problem with a step-by-step description of the analysis of information and actions to localize and eliminate its causes.  This book will be quite enough for the theoretical part. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> Videos on the trashlshuting strategy from Kevin Wallace: <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D3Bo4Pw82G2M">TSHOOT Bull's Eye Strategy # 1</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DZIRxfxeTSLI">TSHOOT Bull's Eye Strategy # 2</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBocjkJ1l71k">TSHOOT Bull's Eye Strategy # 3</a> <br><br>  <b>3.</b> <a href="http://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccnp-tshoot-642-832-quick-reference-9781587143663">CCNP TSHOOT 642-832 Quick Reference</a> - a brain freshener. <br><br><h5>  From theory to practice </h5><br>  First of all, we arm ourselves with the official topology, taking it here: <a href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadBody/6741-102-1-23100/TSHOOT%2520Exam%2520Topology.pdf">Exam Topology</a> <br><br>  Yes, yes, this is the same network topology that is used during the exam.  Strangely enough, but Cisco decided to meet the candidates, and put it in open access.  Of course, the exam questions are confidential, but there is an opportunity to duplicate the topology at home, and begin to set up our own experiments on the <s>destruction of the universe, the</s> destruction and restoration of the work network.  If you have a familiar networker on hand, ask him to break the net for you, but so that you should sweat in search of the ‚Äújambs‚Äù he has brought.  You can also use the previously broken <a href="http://gns3vault.com/labs/troubleshooting/">configs</a> from the respected Ren√©. <br><br>  Finally, I will say that I collected my topology in GNS3 ( <i>in terms of routers</i> ), connecting the virtual component with my physical switches through Cloud. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">It looks like this:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cd/bac/4db/5cdbac4dbd49402eae5133ac320b0594.jpg"><br>  <i>The area marked with a red dotted line is just a neatly superimposed image for easy reading of the entire topology.</i>  <i>Under the DSW1 and DSW2 icons, Cloud-s are hidden ‚Äî devices for interfacing with external switches.</i> <br></div></div><br><h5>  How much time is required </h5><br>  It took 20 days to master the book, plus 10 days to practice.  Total - only a month.  Passed by typing the maximum number of points. <br><br>  Well, that's all I wanted to tell the respected community.  I hope my experience will be useful for future professionals in the field of network technologies. <br><br>  Have a good session! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245081/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245081/</a></p>
