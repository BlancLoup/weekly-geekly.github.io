I read the book of Tina Silig, where she writes that you need to be able to grasp ideas that are in the air.  There were examples of how only one thought improved the workflow or helped open a new business.  For example, Instagram has budded altogether from another, disastrous project. <br>  I began to use this technique: to notice the unusual and try to unleash it into a certain idea.  And then, quite by chance, I met the guys who ‚Äúfell into the air‚Äù, caught a new trend and created a mobile application.  For me personally, their story has become an example of dedication and the ability to see perspective. <br>  So, get acquainted, the project "Peeped-city on the palm." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a7/f52/eeb/7a7f52eebd604b1aaf1b96f2632d14c4.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>History of creation</b> <br><br>  As the developers themselves say, it all started with the VKontakte publics. <br>  Public "Peeped" bred on the VC like mushrooms after a rain.  ‚ÄúSaransk peeped‚Äù, ‚ÄúYekaterinburg peeped‚Äù, ‚ÄúChelyabinsk peeped‚Äù - about 50 cities covered this infection.  And each has several thousand subscribers.

      If you are an active user of VK, then you know how the tape is capable of making seals with seals and fitonashechek.  And I want to know the news of the city.  And I also want to take an active part in them - to write about events, post selfies, like photos, comment. <br>  So the idea was born to make a mobile application ... There is also a competition VC arrived in time.  In general, one to one - and the application is ready.  Here is another respect for the guys: they made the application on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.t4ka.social.saransk">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/RU/app/id1067922338%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> .  Well, to beat on all fronts.  And they were not mistaken.  By the way, Habr√© has their <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/282193/">article</a> on the technical side of the project. <br><br>  <b>The essence of the project</b> <br><br>  Have you heard of Mobile Reporter?  This is a site where anyone can post a story about a news, event, event, post an unusual photo or video.  In general, a resource for people with active citizenship.  He also played a role in creating the ‚ÄúPeep-City in the Palm‚Äù application. <br><br>  Here is an example of how important it is to capture the mood of users and implement their Wishlist.  The developers of ‚ÄúPeeped‚Äù noticed that Internet users want to participate in the life of the city, post cool photos, be useful to other users with the help of their posts.  Another problem is dating.  Most young people live buried in gadgets, they have no time to look around and notice each other.  And in the "Peeped" there are categories of Dating and Faces of the city.  It is verified that the girl who places her photos there gets a bunch of likes and dozens of friend requests.  Alexey, the ideological inspirer and developer of the application, said that, thanks to such an application, the guy met the girl, started dating and even got married. <br><br>  <b>Project work</b> <br><br>  Here I will share first-hand information, so it will be more colorful)) <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWe decided to name the application Peeped (analogy Overheard, we are often confused, someday they will be confused with us =)).</i>  <i>Are we competitors?</i>  <i>Hardly.</i>  <i>They have anonymous stories, we have live chat, news, acquaintances.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But with the slogan had to work.</i>  <i>There were options such as "Peeped - revelations of the city", "Peeped - the city through your eyes", "Peeped - people's news", "Peeped - news of the city", but in the end we are "Peeped - the city in the palm of your hand."</i>  <i>Did you make the right choice?</i>  <i>))</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It was immediately decided to make a character for the project, he is quickly remembered and gives emotionality.</i>  <i>Many thanks to our familiar artist Ksyusha, who literally in a couple of days presented us her options and pinned us up with the ‚ÄúDramatic Look of the Gopher‚Äù</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/378/5e3/853/3785e3853df64bcebd58644ec2a231d1.png"><br><br>  <i>The giraffe "Rafiq" won number 2, such a fashionable and curious type, whose long neck makes it easy to see the surroundings of the city.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b>The Importance Of MVP</b></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The first version of the application, we did only on Android for our hometown - Saransk.</i>  <i>There was neither a category, nor a clever ‚ÄúBest‚Äù news feed, nor an opportunity to send your news.</i>  <i>We solved only one small task, collecting all the news of the city in one place, bringing together the 12 largest communities.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>To get the first users, we asked the public administrators of the ‚ÄúPeeped‚Äù to talk about us. Communicating with the users, we found out that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application is interesting to many, and began to wonder what functionality it would be worth adding what to remove or lower in priority.</i>  <i>For example, participants requested the ability to click on VK links, which helped them to get acquainted through the ‚ÄúFaces of the City‚Äù category.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I had to make changes to the name of the categories.</i>  <i>It turned out that ‚ÄúOverheard‚Äù (one of our categories) is a trademark, as we found out from the conversation with the project founder.</i>  <i>Therefore, we renamed our category Rumors.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>During the creation of the product, the concept of the application changed several times, categories were added, deleted, even their location mattered.</i>  <i>For example, we noticed that today the most popular headings are News, Rumors and Dating.</i>  <i>Therefore ranked them by popularity.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We changed the categories of posts, tried the tutorial in the application and eventually abandoned it, and the design in the Android application was selected only the third time.</i> <br><br>  <i><b>Design</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>It was done as quickly as possible, as time was already pressing, at the same time I wanted to stand out.</i>  <i>Invented the original solution in the form of tabs with a beautiful hat.</i>  <i>For the city of Saransk, I specially painted a separate illustration with sights.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c3/8d0/b1c/0c38d0b1c48542b98c759297e604ab00.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Only after launch they realized that the list is very long and even half of the users do not want to scroll through to the end.</i>  <i>We make a crutch and duplicate it in the left menu.</i>  <i>The hand did not rise to remove the menu in the form of tabs, so a lot of time was spent on hovering beauty in it.</i>  <i>By the way, each city has its own picture.</i>  <i>Only 130 cities.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>As a result, in the latest version, we reduced the height of the header, made posts across the width of the screen, increased the font and reduced the contrast of colors. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  The path of one project is its benefit for me personally: <br>  1. The desire to see new ideas and their willingness to embody.  Well, there were publics, well, you would live on.  So there‚Äôs no - you need to create applications for some reason, work overtime for three months.  Maybe in order to admire these achievements?  )) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c5/c8d/aac/6c5c8daac76141299211561de9736840.png"><br><br>  2. Willingness to make changes, adapting to Central Asia.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a pro, I know what‚Äôs best!‚Äù - this mantra does not always work.  The ability to adapt to the interests and requests of users often ensures the success of the entire work. <br>  By the way, not so long ago I worked on one project, they have a stake on an individual approach and they specifically ask their visitors what can be improved, changed, created specifically for them.  As a result, since 2011 they have the majority of regular customers.  ‚ÄúPeeped‚Äù is also a vivid example of such flexibility.  Alexey writes: ‚ÄúAll this time, testing the application, we studied the opinions of users and therefore worked on the emergence of new features, for example, in the next version there will be an opportunity to filter content by sources‚Äù. <br><br>  3. Purposefulness and perseverance.  Talking with Alexey, listening to how they made changes, reworked, I admire, because I would like to leave everything halfway through.  But they are full of new ideas, for example, to budge one category into an independent project. <br>  The ‚ÄúAds‚Äù category is one of the most popular (approximately 500 entries per day in the app and public).  But they spread it, but few people buy it, because there are no categories to search and sort goods.  We decided to bring this category into a separate project - "Attic - a cozy flea market of the city."  If you are just as interested in this project as we are, we are open to cooperation. ‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75f/450/f9d/75f450f9def54afa88249f3826602e94.png"><br><br>  4. The ability to see the trend.  Mobile applications are now incredibly popular and this is understandable.  For example, I have Bookmate, Lifehacker, <a href="https://peepcity.ru/">‚ÄúPeeped‚Äù</a> on my smartphone and about a dozen other applications that I actively use.  And that's how my world perception, I would not hang out in the public "Peeped", and open the mobile application many times more often. <br>  Take a look around, friends!  How many ideas are in the air!  Look at your project with different eyes, perhaps it is time to risk and conquer new peaks?  Dare and success to you!  And the team "Suspended" - a special thanks for the inspiration and positive! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300434/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300434/</a></p>
