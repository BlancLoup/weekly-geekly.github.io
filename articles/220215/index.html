  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We disassemble Sony Xperia Z2, the new flagship with an unusual cooling system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I got into the hands of the Sony Xperia Z2 smartphone that had not yet been on sale in Russia.  This is an updated and improved version of the six-month-old Xperia Z1, and if the difference between Z and Z1 was quite significant, then between Z1 and Z2 you might not notice it at first glance.  However, if you are not too lazy to look inside, it is impossible to confuse the updated flagship with its predecessor for good reason.  At least because before, in Sony smartphones, and other major brands, thermal copper tubes have never met ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b58/a90/c18/b58a90c18faecdea526fa8363457fc24.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Differences configuration Z2 from Z1 can be listed in one paragraph.  The screen diagonal Z2 is 5.2 inches instead of 5, but the resolution remains the same, 1920 x 1080 pixels.  Instead of a TFT, an IPS-matrix with large viewing angles is used.  The 20.7 megapixel camera can now record video in 4k (Ultra HD) format, but the module itself remains the same.  The Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset changed to Snapdragon 801, and the amount of RAM increased from 2 to 3 GB.  The battery capacity also increased slightly: from 3,000 to 3,200 mAh.

      Is this enough to call Z2 a novelty?  I do not know yet, it is necessary to check in work.  In the meantime, let's see together - what's next Sony's flagship inside.  I note that I also analyzed Z1, and <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/reviews/sony-xperia-z1-rabota-nad-oshibkami-po-zayavkam-trudyashhihsya_4361.html">you can</a> read / see the result <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/reviews/sony-xperia-z1-rabota-nad-oshibkami-po-zayavkam-trudyashhihsya_4361.html">here</a> . <br><br>  Disassembling Z2 is a bit more complicated than its predecessor.  As in the previous version, waterproofing is provided by double-sided tape around the back of the back cover, but now the latter is glued to the battery.  From the point of view of reliability and rigidity of the structure, this is an extremely correct decision. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fc/4ef/d58/7fc4efd588542d7c39a215cbb1e98360.jpg"><br><br>  Let's pay attention to the changed form and the increased NFC antenna.  Now, when pairing with different techniques, it will be a little easier to find the right contact point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e41/bf2/d61/e41bf2d611748454187ceaeb5c12ec10.jpg"><br><br>  Slightly increased in size battery.  But not very significant, in accordance with the increase in capacity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/686/e48/84e/686e4884ed0aad56a4c084c56112ca84.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc1/6e8/098/fc16e8098b23728c1be2b9039a157253.jpg"><br><br>  Remove it and ... wow!  Copper heat pipe!  Just the same, as in radiators of powerful coolers in the computer or on the motherboard.  Only a little smaller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/585/7fb/522/5857fb522439a8e0400ac47fee260fc8.jpg"><br><br>  The tube is long and it is soldered on the back of the screen.  So what exactly it plays the role of a radiator.  An unusual decision, frankly.  Be sure to check how it affects the temperature of the screen itself, whether it burns your cheek if someone calls at the height of a game session in Asphalt 8. Most likely, this will not happen because the heat dissipation area is quite large.  And yet - an amazing decision.  Just amazing.  The question involuntarily arises - will a powerful eight-core processor with an ARM architecture need a portable dropsy?  (by the way, this experience has already been - remember last year‚Äôs NEC Medias X N-06E smartphone). <br><br>  In a microscope, you can examine how the tube is soldered to the surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/334/5a7/913/3345a79135083b281542ad9be9bb27e3.jpg"><br><br>  The motherboard shape and layout is significantly different from its predecessor in Z1.  The components are located more compactly, and protruding thin pieces of PCB have disappeared.  But the thermal grease between the chips and heat dissipating screens remained, without it now in any way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/213/9f1/33f/2139f133f8eaff5335e84e93f7f16a71.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/061/4a8/494/0614a8494f643d6ef731990df3ea3813.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9f/8f4/e6d/c9f8f4e6d1355a879179212a807992c5.jpg"><br><br>  Under the microscope, you can see the Qualcomm MSM8974AB chip hiding under the RAM module.  Such ‚Äúmodesty‚Äù is a standard, and therefore it is impossible to see the chip entirely, without spoiling the board.  In some products, the Huawei SoC and the memory module are placed side by side, however this is due to the fact that the process technology at the SoC is quite ancient and the ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù cannot be done normally. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c76/c64/4d9/c76c644d9fa0c041c93abc57c937eb1a.jpg"><br><br>  If the motherboard has become more durable, then loops on the contrary made thinner.  They look rather flimsy, and when disassembling / assembling it took a fair amount of care so as not to damage anything.  Probably, if you do not climb into the smartphone with inept hands, they will serve as long as necessary, and yet ... shaky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdb/bdc/cd6/fdbbdccd69542b42c14e9b872625d0c6.jpg"><br><br>  We paid attention to the unusual design of the vibration motor.  From the back he has three notches that make him recall the game about Duke Nyukem, or just a sign of radiation danger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b9/651/82c/8b965182c2b05afb472bc749357d456f.jpg"><br><br>  When looking at the microscope, nothing unusual in the design could be noticed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f29/728/163/f297281630a17c2a116b0129d4c872b2.jpg"><br><br>  There may be several options: whether Sony decided to increase the sound of the motor in the mode of shakes, or it is banal to save metal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fae/111/ad5/fae111ad58cab7289555c69c8ae174fa.jpg"><br><br>  Xperia Z2 - the fourth device Sony, which I disassemble in the past six months.  It is impossible not to note the progress in the engineering culture of developers: if the Xperia Z Ultra from the inside <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/reviews/sony-xperia-z-ultra-lichnye-vpechatleniya-i-vskrytie-odnogo-iz-samyh-bolshih-smartshetov_4168.html">looked pretty ... eclectic</a> , then in the Z1 and especially the <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/articles/razbiraem-sony-xperia-z1-compact-malenkiy-smartfon-s-serdtsem-bolshogo-flagmana_4753.html">Z1 Compact there</a> was an increasingly systematic approach to placing components on the board and inside the case.  Z2, frankly, is still far from the beauty of the internal design to Apple products.  But the desire for beauty is evident. <br><br>  In terms of maintainability, the device is at the same level Z1.  It is somewhat easier for him to change the screen, because now the latter is held on snaps and removed relatively easily.  But this is ‚Äúcompensated‚Äù by a more confusing system of fragile loops.  So most inside is better not to climb.  Even if at home there is a professional soldering station. <br><br>  About user impressions of the smartphone (yes, it is assembled back and works fine) I will write in ten days.  I do not want to hurry, especially since the device will go on sale only in May. <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/articles/smartfon-sony-xperia-z2-opyt-ekspluatatsii_5182.html">you can read</a> about my user experience <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/articles/smartfon-sony-xperia-z2-opyt-ekspluatatsii_5182.html">here</a> . <br><br>  <i>The author thanks for the help in preparing the material Alexander Levchenko ( <a href="http://www.tech-town.ru/"><b></b></a><b><a href="http://www.tech-town.ru/">www.tech-town.ru</a></b> )</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220215/</a></p>
