  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The easiest way to organize video broadcast on the site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In my first job, in addition to free lunches, the social package included video broadcasts from the dining room - at the address known to all employees, it was possible to see on the air if there were free tables so as not to aggravate the suffering of the body that had survived while waiting for lunch, also standing in line.  For a sysadmin, magic is not very complicated, but for most workers it is very necessary.  But progress does not stand still, and any of those who dined at that time in the dining room could organize a public broadcast from virtually any camera today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea4/2cb/921/ea42cb92179fb637cd5ca5ed5cef17ef.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Few people know, but Ivideon has a very useful and completely free feature that allows you to open access to the camera and embed it in your website or blog in just a couple of clicks: you don‚Äôt need to deploy servers and your own <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Delivery_Network">CDN</a> if the broadcast is planned to be global, not required set streaming software like VLC, Wowza, RED5 and be fully responsible for broadcasting from and to.  All major work will make the cloud Ivideon. <br><br><h5>  Camera connection </h5><br>  Almost anything can work as a video source for <a href="http://ru.ivideon.com/">Ivideon</a> :

    <ol><li>  computer with webcam </li><li>  external web or ip camera </li><li>  analog video recorder (DVR) </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.ivideon.com/shop/category/ip-kameryi-s-servisom-ivideon/">Ivideon Cloud IP Camera</a> </li></ol><br>  In the first three cases, the Ivideon Server application installed on the computer / server will be required: it will recognize the camera among the available devices, and connect the camera to the cloud via an encrypted channel. <br><br>  In the latter case, it is not even necessary to have a computer running Ivideon Server.  There are both indoor indoor cameras and outdoor options.  And some of them have built-in connectivity via 3G or Yota by installing the appropriate USB modem. <br><br><h5>  Public settings </h5><br>  Of course, Ivideon is first and foremost a private video surveillance service.  A camera connected to Ivideon itself reports a suspicious movement or sound, records the event to the cloud and informs the owner about it, for example, using a push notification. <br>  If we want to use the camera for broadcast on our website, it is required to make it public. <br><br>  This is done in just a couple of clicks: <br><br>  Click on the settings button under the camera image in the Ivideon personal account and select the menu item: ‚ÄúPublic access‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd3/cd0/1fb/fd3cd01fb2eecbb5df9fe216560e10f8.png"><br><br>  As a result, a window opens where all the basic settings are made: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da6/e64/282/da6e64282ef0b57a352d7b67299544fb.jpg"><br><br>  The last step allows you to simply enable / disable public access to the already configured broadcast.  That's the whole manual - everything is really so simple. <br><br><h5>  Embedding </h5><br>  The video broadcast code is embedded as usual iFrame - for example, YouTube.  The broadcast will work on third-party resources that support iFrame - for example, you can embed Ivideon broadcasts in LiveJournal or Blogger.com. <br><br>  There was also the idea to add live Ivideon broadcasts to the list of supported resources on Habr√©.  Various variants of their useful application suggest themselves: for example, an educational hub can be livened up with live broadcasts of interesting lectures.  Hub "Offices of IT-companies" - broadcasts from these offices.  And there, you see, and in the Cosmonautics hub it will be possible to show missile launches on the air.  Surely, these are not all possible options for the use of such functionality useful for Habr.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/deniskin/" class="user_link">deniskin</a> supported this idea and promised to build ivideon into the number of supported video servers on Habr√© in the future. <br><br>  On the dry side, using Ivideon gives the following: <br><br><ol><li>  Does not require a sysadmin qualification </li><li>  Does not require server rental in a data center with a wide channel under the video </li><li>  High reliability.  Ivideon uses a network of data centers. </li><li>  Allows you to deploy international broadcast: Ivideon nodes are located on all continents, which allows you to deliver video with minimal delay </li><li>  Playback support on a smartphone or tablet - the video stream adapts on the fly for different playback formats </li></ol><br>  For personal use, all this can be obtained for <a href="http://ru.ivideon.com/tariffs/">free</a> .  At the same time, there are no restrictions for the needs of large companies: through Ivideon, you can organize broadcasts from hundreds of thousands of cameras across a single city or the entire planet. <br><br><h4>  Ivideon tv </h4><br>  Support for public cameras in Ivideon is an additional option, which, suddenly, has become popular.  At some point, it became interesting to us to combine all the cameras opened by users into a single directory.  We called it <a href="http://www.ivideon.com/tv/">Ivideon TV</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/694/7ad/5bf/6947ad5bfb37cb1766742c61e98dbdf7.jpg"><br><br>  You can ‚Äúwander‚Äù through it and see the options of the cameras that users open, etc.  All cameras are pre-moderated: there will be no broadcasts in Ivideon TV in which people express themselves through the lack of clothes. <br><br>  By the way, it is important to understand that the quality of the broadcast of the camera primarily depends on the camera itself, which the user has set and the Internet channel available on his side for transmitting video from this camera.  Some use 3G, which sometimes becomes noticeable when viewed.  Ivideon TV has both very high quality and cheap Chinese cameras, so the image quality is very different. <br><br>  There are many interesting cameras with several million views.  Some time ago, for obvious reasons, cameras from the Crimea became popular (clickable): <br><br> <a href="http://www.ivideon.com/tv/camera/100-ed8a80fbf6ecb23ddb3f0fa9bc56eece/0/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a2/2ad/ef9/3a22adef91b7bb3a748333a2a4d68730.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Now, judging by Google‚Äôs tips, priorities <a href="">have changed a bit</a> , but the meaning is the same.  What a gift to archaeologists of the future - our time will leave behind a boundless amount of historical evidence.  Studying cameras <a href="http://www.ivideon.com/tv/map">on maps</a> on Ivideon TV, I only regretted that in this way we can only travel through space, and not through time.  Video broadcasting from the past without the ability to influence events - is this not an ideal concept of time travel?  Maybe this will come to this someday. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/029/6a8/530/0296a8530d6e7ca1f75c374da390dbfc.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Careful work </h4><br>  So far, feature requests are simpler than time travel, but they arrive regularly: categories, list of popular cameras, advanced commenting system with the involvement of camera owners in the discussion, automatic selection of the best quality cameras, etc.  The field for activity is huge.  I really want to realize all this, so right now Ivideon is <a href="http://ru.ivideon.com/jobs/">looking for a</a> new developer <a href="http://ru.ivideon.com/jobs/">team</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230687/</a></p>
