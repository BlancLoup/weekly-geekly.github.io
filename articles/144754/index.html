And better is good than bad.  Inch that way on 24, but on a normal matrix.  In general, I buy goods in online stores - there are good prices, and the characteristics are honest, and in general all pluses.  But the monitor ... On the Internet, wherever you spit - everywhere there are stories about ‚Äúwrong black‚Äù, ‚Äúuneven illumination‚Äù, ‚Äúcrystallization effect‚Äù, ‚Äúcoverage of color space‚Äù, etc.  By the numbers in the plate and the picture of figs you will understand how this monitor will actually show.  And I decided to go and see them live. <br><br>  Two and a half household and computer equipment stores in my hometown didn‚Äôt make me happy.  Well, I didn‚Äôt really hope - it‚Äôs good to get an hour on the train to the capital, so you can go for a swim and see at your leisure.  What I did.  I learned in advance where there are shops with monitors - and I tried to capture all the categories: <br><ul><li>  major appliance chains </li><li>  purely computer stores </li><li>  offline online stores </li></ul>  During the day I walked in the amount of about 20 places.  I did not find any monitors or sales assistants in any store.  Rather, there were, of course, things and people who tried to impersonate themselves in the two categories above, but they did not succeed in this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, once again about the purpose of my trip - I wanted to see live working monitors of different models and compare their quality \ color rendition \ defects.  Now that I saw in reality.

    <h4>  Rows of monitors off </h4><br>  I met two stores in which the monitors were turned off.  Moreover, in order to save space, they did not stand parallel to the wall, but as a ‚Äúladder‚Äù, so that only part of the screen is visible.  How, well, tell me, how should I assess the quality of the monitor by its left-upper corner seen on the top shelf in the off state? <br><br><h4>  Price tags </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c9/4d2/ec2/5c94d2ec2df8f41b289da9c3881ac8d2.jpg" align="left">  The monitor, as it seems to me, does not have too many characteristics.  Diagonal, matrix type, backlight type, resolution, inputs, viewing angles, brightness / contrast, reaction time - everything seems to be important?  9 points.  Nowhere, I repeat - in one store I did not see that all of the monitors had all these parameters written on the price tag.  In half of the stores, the price tag looks like ‚Äú% model% -% diagonal% -% price%‚Äù and that's it.  The second half of the stores tried to do something better, but it came down to a copy-paste of devils-from where, with the result that each monitor has its own, individual set of parameters.  Monitors from the same manufacturer in the same store can have in the price list from 2 to 10 parameters (despite the fact that it is the same model, just with different diagonals).  Well, so gobbled up - what can you do.  Everyone do not care. <br><br><h4>  Long live savings </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f0/2be/9d4/7f02be9d4a709cd36549c5ff21f06719.jpg" align="right">  In the yard in 2012.  May month.  In most of the stores that I went around, the monitors were connected via analog (VGA) input.  And the Chinese cords were connected to a cheap VGA splitter, at a resolution far from HD, to some kind of office computer that acted out of the last twisting fashionable cinema at 15 fps.  Oh yeah, there is no stabilization / grounding of electricity either.  As a result, we see a zamylennaya, twitching analog image with distortion at the edges, flickering and ants.  And what the hell is typical - on all monitors equally awful.  And what the hell is the ‚Äúwrong black‚Äù or ‚Äúcrystallization effect‚Äù when I am unable to read the 16th font size on these monitors at an emphasis!  It is clear that the normal wiring diagram, the use of digital inputs of monitors (cables, splitters) will be slightly more expensive.  But it will also give a normal picture! <br><br><h4>  Content </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/926/760/e70/926760e70ff917b085e03a7d280fcdbe.jpg" align="left">  Where the monitors worked and showed at least somewhat bearable, they still showed mostly crap.  Either a store advertisement, or a monitor advertisement (it is especially amusing to see ads, for example, LG on DELL monitors - the signal is divorced at one), or the Windows desktop.  Neither the first, nor the second, nor the third does not help to assess the quality of the monitor.  Why is it impossible (well, at least on request) to show the setup table, control photos?  But you can not, that's all. <br><br><h4>  Range </h4><br>  The monitors presented in the stores I visited were divided into three unequal parts according to the following principles: <br><ul><li>  85% - full bullshit, the main thing is cheaper </li><li>  10% - full bullshit, more importantly expensive </li><li>  5% - good monitors for decent, but intelligible money </li></ul>  The first group consisted of all kinds of TN-matrices, which are pushed ‚Äúinto the load‚Äù by those who buy a monoblock, laptop or video card.  By itself, the price of the load should be less, and the fact that it is on the monitor, and not on the video card, people will eventually look for many hours a day - this is all on the drum.  The second group included monitors with the words ‚Äúsuper light‚Äù, ‚Äútwice Professional‚Äù, ‚Äú3D‚Äù and all sorts of frames with apples and rhinestones (well, of course, you need to warm your hands on people who don‚Äôt count money).  At the same time, really good monitors, with normal IPS-matrices in every store, were counted on the fingers of one hand.  After all, they are too expensive for the average buyer and not too expensive for the rich, as a conclusion - there is no point in selling them. <br><br><h4>  Professionalism of sellers </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55f/a9d/e09/55fa9de0944df6d5e025be5ecd4dd1e6.jpg" align="right"><br>  Oh, it's just a song, I specifically left last.  Here are my questions to sales assistants and answers to them.  Once again - I spoke not with grandmothers in the market and not in the gateway with the gopnik, but with a person who works in the ‚ÄúMonitors‚Äù department of the computer store. <br><br>  <b>Why do you have all the monitors connected by analogue, and not by a digit?</b> <br><ul><li>  We have always been like this. </li><li>  Who cares?  The picture is the same. </li><li>  The signal from the analog input is faster. </li><li>  We only have a video card with a VGA output. </li><li>  Well, this cable must be sought ... </li></ul><br>  <b>Here you have two monitors nearby: A and B. How do they differ?</b> <br><ul><li>  Yes, almost nothing! </li><li>  Yes, almost everyone! </li><li>  Quality. </li><li>  At the cost of. </li><li>  Well, these are completely different products. </li><li>  At B is now an action! </li></ul><br>  <b>What type of matrix does this monitor have?</b> <br><ul><li>  Liquid crystal </li><li>  LED </li><li>  24 inches </li><li>  16: 9 </li><li>  Standard </li><li>  Wide angle </li></ul><br>  Admittedly, sometimes sellers answered correctly.  But it was in that and only in that case when on the price tag of the monitor the answer to my question was written.  Well, that is, I ask "maximum resolution" - the price tag scanning module and the substring search are included.  Moreover, it is clear that this process loads the CPU by 100% and not the fact that simply ‚Äúresolution‚Äù or ‚Äú1920x1080‚Äù will be recognized as a coincidence.  If there was no answer, the seller began to drive the snowstorm without blushing.  He did not leave to look for information in the documentation, on the Internet, or to consult with his colleagues ‚Äî he simply began to give out arbitrary words on the near-monitor topic. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  As you understand, I did not see or buy anything.  We'll have to believe in the word numbers in online stores and reviews on the forums.  Somehow I get out.  But explain to me, please, why everything is as it is?  Maybe I don‚Äôt understand something and it is this model of selling monitors for some marketing and magical reasons that provides maximum profit - but why?  Is it really not better to keep the monitors turned on, to spend money on digital cables and splitters once, to think once in a while about normal content, to print the necessary information on the price tag, to teach sellers to answer dozens of questions correctly (and I don‚Äôt even come to mind).  What's so complicated?  Doesn't that boost sales? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144754/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144754/</a></p>
