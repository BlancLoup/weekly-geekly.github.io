  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Analysis of the work of regional web-studios</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I was lucky to be born and live for 20 years in the small city of Thule.  In all respects a pleasant city, with its problems, fools and roads.  But this is not about the latter (although it would be worth it).  It's about fools and sites.  The city has a funny situation with the development of IT-technologies, and Web'a in particular.  The city is not big, so  Our providers have not yet developed to a decent level and the prices for Internet are high.  T.ch.  say that "the Internet has come to every home" is not worth it.  But there has been a completely crazy trend in the development of Internet services, due to its proximity to Moscow.  So, studios developing sites in Tula are very large.  They are not so much more than the companies to which they can offer website development, but, at least, there shouldn't be enough work for everyone.  The question is solved simply - everyone is running to the capital, making websites for local offices at bargain prices.  However, we must pay tribute to them, bargain prices approaching the capital. <br><br>  My task was to understand the issue of price and quality of services provided.  Why Tula was taken as an example is understandable.  The fact that the situation is fundamentally different in other regions is a fact.  Larger cities are farther from the center, and due to the distance / number ratio, prices and quality of work remain at the same level.  So, the results of the study, at the same time and its methodology below.  I want to note right away that I do not give references to the companies under study, and I don‚Äôt list their names in the ratings.  I do not work in one of the listed companies, and not one of them is not a competitor (I simply do not have my own studio, there is nothing to compete with).  T.ch.  I will be objective. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So research ...

      <b>Stage one.</b>  <b>List of the most famous studios of the city:</b> <br>  Artprime, Bureau of beautiful solutions, WebLine, Diol-IT, Dira, Create IT, Maximaster, Mirmeks, Solveb, Art.  Afanasyev, Tekart, Telematic, Forumia, Castcom, GlobalSiteGroup, Kiwi-studio, Webcre8, WebGK, WebGo. <br><br>  <b>Stage Two.</b>  <b>Drawing up the subject of study:</b> <br>  We will assume that on day 1 I became the head of one large network of image optics.  Yes, and, by coincidence, decided to open a couple of salons in the city.  Well, more details in the letter, which was prepared by all studios: <br>  <i>"Good day!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Our company is engaged in the supply and sale of luxury optics.</i>  <i>In the near future, we plan to open several of our stores in the city center of Tula, as well as several shopping centers.</i>  <i>The company is new and, at the moment, we are busy with the organizational component of the business.</i>  <i>So</i>  <i>the opening is planned for the autumn-winter of this year.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Now we are choosing a company that will undertake the development of the logo, corporate identity and website for us.</i>  <i>We studied your site, portfolio and some work we liked. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Not counting the last sentence - all fiction.</i>  <i>Yes, I forgot to say, the development of the corporate style was launched with the same brush (so as not to run 2 times).</i> <br><br>  <b>Stage Three.</b>  <b>Drafting the brief.</b> <br>  Those.  I decided not to write the assignment for such a project, but, like any average customer, put forward my requirements in the form of a brief (however, a little more than a standard customer, just in case). <br>  The brief turned out like this: <br>  <i>‚Äú <u>About the company: the</u> main activity is the sale of luxury optics.</i>  <i>A variety of brands: image sun-protection optics: Vogue, C.Dior, Chanel, D &amp; G, and others;</i>  <i>lenses Ciba Vision, Maxima Optics, etc.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><u>Clients:</u> Mostly - individuals with incomes above average and top managers</i> <i><br></i>  <i><u>Marketing:</u> The main way of promotion is advertising in local media.</i>  <i>Internet - contextual advertising, PR in thematic resources.</i>  <i>Perhaps a banner ad.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><u>Corporate Identity:</u> Requirements - modern, business, stylish, bright, memorable.</i>  <i>It is important to stand out from the competition.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><u>Site requirements:</u> On the site, the visitor must find out the phone numbers and address, read the catalog.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><u>Design:</u> The main thing is that the site is convenient and pleasant to use.</i>  <i>But the main task is elegance, minimalist chic.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>According to the style, we like the Screen Optics website (www.ekranoptika.ru).</i> <i><br></i>  <i><u>Site menu:</u></i> <i><br></i>  <i>About salon</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Catalog</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Services</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Photo Gallery (similar to the one on Screen Optics)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Likbez (several articles, we will write ourselves)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Contacts</i> <i><br></i>  <i><u>The catalog will include sections:</u> solar optics, corrective optics, lenses.</i>  <i>Subsections - the names of manufacturers.</i>  <i>We will update the site ourselves, because we need a management system. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>Stage Four.</b>  <b>Newsletter.</b> <br>  The most tedious process.  There were 25 addresses to send. However, a small percentage had to be dropped, since they did not have an email address on the site or any form to send a request.  I am glad that at least the phone number was specified (although one company had forgotten about it, but it had an address, which is already interesting). <br>  For sending, the address was registered on the most inconvenient, slow, but popular service - mail.ru. <br><br>  Stage fifth and first rating.  Response rate <br>  I remember Steve Ballmer in his interview saying that he would respond to any mail addressed to him during the day.  If you do not answer in this period - this is a manifestation of disrespect. <br>  ‚Ä¢ On the same day, 4 companies responded. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The next day - 8 companies. <br>  ‚Ä¢ In a day - 2 companies. <br>  ‚Ä¢ A week later, 2 more companies ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Decided not to answer - 5 companies <br><br>  <b>Stage Six.</b>  <b>Response formats</b> <br>  The first to respond was a robot (or a robotic secretary).  The answer was the following: ‚Äúthe application has been accepted, in 2 days we will send you an offer‚Äù. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Commercial offers in word format - 7 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Answers with prices for each service (website, style, logo) - 6 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Answers with one price for everything - 3 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Answers with the proposal to talk on the phone without specifying the price - 3 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Bounce - 1 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Double answer - 1 <br>  In response, a couple of companies managed to write in their entire history and all their projects (completed and in development).  Moreover, if the projects they are not really bummed out - the story had to read for a long time. <br><br>  <b>Stage Seven.</b>  <b>Prices.</b> <br>  The most diverse.  Those that answered the longest offered the highest prices.  Those that responded within the first two days are by the mean.  The scatter is as follows: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Logo - 8-15 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Corporate identity - 15-35 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Website - 40-80 (someone else offered to buy Bitrix at our expense, someone indicated an initial price of 60 tr.) <br>  The most popular prices for a site are 45 tr, for a corporate style - 30 tr, for a logo - 10 tr <br><br>  <b>Findings.</b>  In fact, the results are disappointing.  There are many companies, but almost no sane.  Those that have been on the market for a long time, with their large portfolio, are divided into 2 groups conditionally by a bunch of grateful customers: taking a lot, taking a little.  Moreover, the quality of them about the same.  And some middling win in the quality, price and size of the portfolio, although there are not much more than 2 years on the market.  But, if a phone of the type +7 (495) appears on the website of the Tula company ... - prices immediately rise geometrically.  The market is oversaturated, and the price / quality ratio is suspiciously small. <br><br>  PS first topic on Habr√©, t.ch.  I will be glad to hear about errors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40860/</a></p>
