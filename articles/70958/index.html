What can be achieved with good memory?  And let's estimate right now!?  For a start, I think it is worth remembering education and work: read a book in a few days and remember everything, exams in the evening for 5, programming language in a month ... you can continue for a long time. <br><br>  Some people are born with a phenomenal memory, and the rest can train and achieve not even phenomenal results, but very decent ones that will allow to reach very high heights, not to mention the rather simple things listed just above ... Therefore, my note is about training memory of ordinary people: concise and to the point. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>Ways to workout</b> </h4>

      <b>The first way:</b> <br><br>  To begin with, remember that memorization in a person takes place on the basis of associations: for example, you traveled to the sea and heard excellent new music, you liked it ... a month later you visited a restaurant in your city, where that music played again, you filled it with the restaurant.  If this is a subject, it must be presented and it is desirable to remember when you last saw it.  This is the easiest way to memorize, when you want to remember something, associate this information with any association from the past and it is more likely to be remembered.  In addition, it is a way to train memory. <br><br><br>  <b>The second way:</b> <br><br>  The second method is also based on an associative series, from the famous world champion in memory of Dominic O'Brien.  The bottom line: present the items you need to remember on an imaginary route (like, for example, your daily journey home), as if they really were there.  By the way, he has a book ‚ÄúHow to develop an absolute memory,‚Äù I advise you to read ... <br><br><br>  <b>The third way:</b> <br><br>  I mentioned it in another post.  The method is based on a game called "cubes".  Develops memory and attention.  They are trained pilots, chess players and special services.  The bottom line: you need to buy 10 identical bones, in size and color, take 3 for a start, shake in your hands (or not in your hands), put on the table, raise your hand for a split second and cover again, so that you see all 3 bones, say what numbers fell out and the approximate location of the cubes.  Gradually increase the number of bones, try to bring to 10. When it becomes easy, you can replace a part of the bones with others of a different size and color.  Over time, it is worth changing objects, for example, try to do this with rice groats :) The exercise is repeated daily for 15 minutes.  This is my favorite exercise, it works great! <br><br><br>  <b>Fourth way:</b> <br><br>  This method is used by almost all participants in the memorization championship.  So, a person can keep attention on an object as long as he is interested in him and as long as he can find something new in him.  Then attention weakens and switches.  This is a proven fact.  The essence of the exercise: imagine any object, for example, a laptop, and keep the thought on it.  At the same time, nothing can be done with an imaginary object, only to represent a static image.  In a few minutes you will be thinking about something else, but not about the subject, and if you thought about the laptop first, then you start thinking which model, then which manufacturer, etc.  I think everything is different, but everyone makes a logical chain.  At that moment, when you understand that you are no longer thinking about a subject, you must go back through your chain, remembering each link and as a result return to the subject.  Then we repeat.  Exercise should be done daily, taking into account the specifics - almost anywhere.  I used it too, difficult and rather boring, but the effect is worth the effort! <br><br><br>  <b>Total:</b> <br><br>  Do these exercises daily, even if you need to apply a little will.  I give a 100% guarantee - if you do it over the course of a month, day after day, the result will surprise you a lot and make you happy! <br><br>  Yes, by the way, according to the results of one study, in order to memorize the text well, you need to read it 7 times for 7 days, so that memorization beginners of geniuses read my post 7 times;) <br><br>  <b>Author:</b> <br>  Nikita Semenov ( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/semenov.nikita.andreevich">Facebook</a> , <a href="http://vk.com/simferopol">VK</a> , <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/nikitasemenov">LinkedIn</a> ) <br>  CEO <br>  <a href="http://secl.com.ua/">SECL GROUP / Internet Sales Technologies</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70958/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70958/</a></p>
