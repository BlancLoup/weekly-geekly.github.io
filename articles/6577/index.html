Now, together with qualified specialists of Perevedem.ru, ABBYY offers a full range of services in the field of professional translation - from comprehensive services to large corporate customers to high-tech services for express translation of texts online. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúThis cooperation meets the main task of ABBYY, - we want our products to make people and companies more successful, reach their goals faster and spend less time and effort on this,‚Äù commented Margarita Amalitskaya, ABBYY marketing director and director Lingvo product direction.  - ABBYY is widely known for its Lingvo electronic dictionaries, which we estimate are used by about five million people.  Professional translation is a logical extension of the range of our proposals, the possibility of a comprehensive solution to the problems associated with translation.  Electronic dictionaries, Lingvo Online Internet service, services of professional translators - all this allows us to quickly and efficiently meet any needs of customers and users, be it the translation of individual words or entire texts, oral or written, complex long-term project or a small one-time task. ‚Äù <br><br>  The company "Perevedem.ru" has a long-term, diverse experience in the field of translation, well-organized customer service, and also actively conducts its own technological developments.

      ABBYY, in cooperation with Perevedem.ru, proposes the translation of texts of the most diverse subjects into Russian from a foreign language (including English, German, French, Chinese, Japanese and other languages) and in the opposite direction.  Highly specialized high-volume translations are performed with the involvement of experts in the relevant field, as well as native speakers, which ensures a quality level that meets the requirements of major international organizations. <br><br>  Corporate customers are provided with comprehensive services in the field of translation and interpretation.  In addition, it offers a rare compilation of glossaries and specialized dictionaries needed to achieve unity of terminology and style for the entire translation of the company‚Äôs documentation.  The highest professional level of such dictionaries is ensured by the joint work of qualified Perevedem.ru specialists and the team of lexicographers and ABBYY developers, as well as the use of modern technologies and software. <br><br>  Technological developments of Perededem.ru allowed us to significantly improve the quality of customer service, as well as expand the range of services and offer a unique online express translation service for the Russian market.  ‚ÄúIf a customer needs to translate a small text or even a single phrase, he can use the express translation service on the website <a href="http://www.perevedem.lingvo.ru/">www.perevedem.lingvo.ru</a> and in just half an hour get a translation made by a professional.  In contrast to the usual practice of translation bureaus here, you will not have to wait for a result for at least two days, and also spend time agreeing on and placing an order, said Ivan Smolnikov, general director of Perevedem.ru.  - The uniqueness of express translation services is not only in the speed of the order, but also in the absence of restrictions on the minimum cost of the order and the minimum amount of text.  You can order a professional translation of just a few words, paying only the actual volume and not a word more. ‚Äù <br><br>  For the convenience of users, the evaluation of the cost and timing of the translation is done directly on the site, online.  If the original is presented in text form, for example, in Microsoft Word format, the calculation takes place automatically; in case of using other formats, Perevedem.ru manager determines the cost and time of the translation and informs the customer.  You can pay for services using all common online payment tools, including credit cards, and by bank transfer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6577/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6577/</a></p>
