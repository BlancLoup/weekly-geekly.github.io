Hemoglobin of spilled blood gives the bruise a classic dark purple color.  Then leukocytes surround the site of damage and cause the destruction of red blood cells, which contributes to the appearance of substances responsible for discoloration. <br><br>  The products of hemoglobin destruction are biliverdin (green bile pigment) and bilirubin (yellow-red pigment of bile).  Later, decay products at the site of injury are removed, and the color disappears.  This process is similar to the process of getting rid of ‚Äúaged‚Äù red blood cells.  White blood cells called macrophages break down dead red blood cells in the spleen, liver, bone marrow and other tissues.  Bilirubin is absorbed by the liver, where it turns into bile and takes part in the digestion of food.  It is bilirubin that gives decay products a characteristic color.

      <strong>SHOWER HANDLING</strong> <br><br>  <em>Is it true that the darker the color of an alcoholic beverage, the heavier the hangover.</em>  <em>Whiskey, red wine or brandy will cause a more severe hangover than vodka or white wine, because darker beverages contain so-called congeners.</em> <br><br>  Most people drink alcohol because of the ethyl alcohol they contain. <a name="habracut"></a>  However, they contain other congeners - biologically active components.  Congeners include complex organic molecules (polyphenol), other alcohols (methanol) and histamine.  They are formed along with ethyl alcohol in the fermentation process, or ripening, of an alcoholic beverage.  It is believed that congeners are responsible for the effect of intoxication and the subsequent hangover.  People who use alcohol based on pure alcohol (for example, vodka) suffer less from hangover symptoms than those who drink darker alcoholic beverages (whiskey, brandy, red wine), in which the congener content is much higher. <br><br>  The main culprit hangover recognized congener methanol.  The human body absorbs methanol in the same way as ethanol, but the end products are different.  Ethanol produces acetaldehyde, and the splitting of methanol produces mainly formaldehyde.  It is more toxic than acetaldehyde, and in high concentrations can cause blindness and even death.  Ethanol slows down the process of cleavage of methanol, so, perhaps, "sober" softens the symptoms of a hangover.  As it was revealed in the course of research, according to the severity of a hangover, alcoholic beverages can be arranged as follows (in descending order): brandy, red wine, rum, whiskey, white wine, gin, vodka, pure alcohol. <br><br>  <strong>High forehead</strong> <br><br>  <em>Why does a man need eyebrows?</em> <em><br></em> <br>  With the help of our amazingly mobile eyebrows, we convey our feelings.  The position of the eyebrows gives a person a certain expression, and others get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhis mood.  Eyebrows help to understand whether a person is friendly or it is better not to approach him in order to avoid trouble.  There are different types of smiles.  Some express joy or satisfaction, others express cunning, gloating, and even anger.  The position of the eyebrows on the forehead allows you to judge the feelings and mood of a person. <br><br>  Eyebrows play an important role in the expression of feelings.  Perhaps the most important is the movement of the eyebrows, as bouncing - the rapid raising and lowering of the eyebrows, expressing understanding or approval.  In ancient times, the ability to transmit friendly intentions from a safe distance certainly helped our ancestors to survive.  The transmission of various signals by the eyebrows is a widespread phenomenon among primates, although only in humans the eyebrows are noticeably visible on the face, since the background is the skin devoid of hair. <br><br>  <strong>LIFE ON BEER</strong> <br><br>  <em>How long can a person live, using only beer as food and drink?</em>  <em>And which beers - el (light beer), strong porter (black beer) or soft beer - give a better chance of survival?</em> <em><br></em> <br>  For centuries, beer has been considered the most important food item, liquid bread.  In ancient Egypt, the labor of workers was paid by beer.  In England in 1492, a gallon of beer per day was received by sailors of the navy Henry VII, and later as a salary by the court ladies Elizabeth I. Beer was brewed from brewing barley rich in vitamins, and therefore it was valued as a highly nutritious product.  Beer and today is considered as such.  Looking at the comparative tables of the nutritional value of various products, we will see that a pint of beer contains more than 5% of the recommended daily dose of several types of vitamins - B9, B6 and B2.  True, such vitamins as A, C and D are absent in beer. <br><br>  Of course, it is unethical to conduct an experiment to find out whether a person can survive by eating only beer.  Nevertheless, during the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), a doctor in the English navy, John Clefan, conducted a clinical trial.  Three ships were sent from England to America.  On board one, Grampus, a lot of beer was loaded, on the other two control vessels, Daedalus and Tortoise, only the standard rate of alcoholic beverages.  Due to bad weather, the voyage was delayed, but at the end of this unusually long voyage, it turned out, according to the CLE-FAN report, that 112 sailors from the crew of the ship Daedalus and 62 from the crew of the Tortoise needed hospitalization.  On the ship "Grampus", on the contrary, only 13 people fell ill.  The result is unambiguous. <br><br>  Of course, eight pints (4 liters) of beer per day, which once constituted the seamen‚Äôs daily ration, are not now considered a moderate dose of alcohol consumption.  The state of the liver of those sailors can only guess.  Whatever may be said about beer diets, eating beer alone is not the best strategy for a healthy lifestyle. <br>  <strong>FATTY BOOKLINE</strong> <br><br>  <em>How thick should a person be to become invulnerable to bullets?</em>  <em>That is, what layer of fat you need to have in order for a bullet fired from a regular pistol to reach vital organs?</em> <br><br>  Given the properties of the tissues of the human body, as well as the presence of protruding parts of the body - arms, legs, eyes, ears, male genital organs - it is safe to say that a human body cannot be invulnerable to bullets.  Even if the skin is thick enough to prevent the bullet from penetrating inside the body, the shock wave can seriously injure the internal organs and the network of subcutaneous nerves - such is the damaging effect of the shot with a shot.  A shot released from a shotgun can kill a person without breaking through his skin. <br><br>  The depth of penetration of a bullet into an organism depends on a number of factors: its destructive power, caliber, weight, shape and material from which it is made.  Bullets for rifles and small arms come in various calibers - from 5 to 15 mm, their energy can be from 70 to 7000 J. The caliber of a bullet of a standard police pistol is 9 mm, the initial energy of this bullet is 500 J. The penetration depth is measured by a shot into viscous mass of  A bullet fired from a police pistol from a distance of 5 m goes into such a mass by 30 cm. <br><br>  To establish the weight of the subcutaneous fat of such thickness, first calculate the surface area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe body without taking into account fat.  There are several formulas for calculating body surface area.  I will use the Mosteller formula, according to which the surface area of ‚Äã‚Äãa human body in square centimeters is equal to 1/60 square root of the product of numbers expressing its height in centimeters and weight in kilograms.  For example, the surface area of ‚Äã‚Äãa person's body is 175 cm tall and weighing 75 kg is 1.91 m2  Thus, in order for this entire area to be covered with a layer of fat of 30 cm with a density of 1 g / cm3, a person must weigh at least 573 kg.  Plus the weight of the body itself (without fat) - it turns out that a bulletproof person must have a weight of about 650 kg. <br><br>  <strong>Late Reaction</strong> <br><br>  <em>Why, after physical exertion the next day, my legs hurt less than two days later.</em>  <em>How is this explained?</em> <em><br></em> <br>  The delayed occurrence of painful sensations in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe muscles is the result of a large number of breaks in them.  In an effort to perform the exercise as best we can, we overly strain our muscles.  Muscle overstrain (usually achieved with an increasing load on the muscles, for example, when we lift weights or run a lot for several days in a row) causes breaks in muscle fibers.  During the first day after the overload, we experience only mild pain in the muscles. <br><br>  Especially painful sensations in the muscle area occur with a sharp increase in the load on them, causing a greater number of breaks in the muscle tissues - it is the number of breaks that increases, and not the size of each of them.  In this case, more time is spent on the formation of scar tissue, because it is formed at the site of damage perpendicular to the rupture itself.  As soon as a new tissue is formed, we begin to experience a sharper pain, because we reactivate and stretch this renewed, but less flexible muscle until its strength and flexibility are restored. <br><br>  <strong>Unnecessary organ</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  <em>Does the appendix perform any functions?</em>  <em>What is his purpose?</em> <br><br>  The analogue of the appendix in most animals is the blind process, located at the junction of the small intestine in the large.  As a rule, predatory mammals have a small process that plays the same role in their bodies as the appendix in humans.  But in many herbivorous mammals, the blind process is markedly increased, and its purpose is to create all sorts of amazing anatomical relationships.  The function of the blind appendage in such animals is to break down complex carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids and then absorb them as an energy source.  The cecum is also involved in the process of generating energy in animals such as horses, rabbits, rats, guinea pigs and pigs, in which fermentation of cellulose occurs in this organ.  In cattle and sheep, this function is performed by the stomach, so they are less dependent on the cecum.  An additional function of the blind appendix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe reabsorption of water from the gastrointestinal tract.  In humans and predatory mammals, this work is performed by the large intestine. <br><br>  Once there was indeed the opinion that the appendix does not perform any function and is an evolutionary remnant, but now this view is considered obsolete.  The most important function of the appendix is ‚Äã‚Äãto ensure the immunity of the developing embryo, but this organ continues to fulfill its purpose in the adult organism, although it is not so indispensable and you can live peacefully without it.  Apparently, with the help of an appendix, immunocytes detect antigens of bacteria and other organisms living in the intestine.  Due to this, the immune system distinguishes between ‚Äúits own‚Äù and ‚Äúalien‚Äù and does not destroy bacteria that safely coexist with the body.  There are other organs that perform this function.  Peyer's patches of the intestine help the immune system to affect the normal contents of the intestines.  By the time the body matures, the immune system is already able to cope independently with foreign substances entering the gastrointestinal tract, and the appendix loses its value.  But the occurrence of defects in the immune space can contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases and inflammation of the intestines. <br><br>  It is interesting to note that appendix surgery is used as a personal "spare material".  For example, the process itself is removed, and its tissue is used during the recovery operation of the bladder without fear that the immune reaction will cause its rejection, as is often the case when another person‚Äôs tissue is transplanted. <br><br>  <em>MISTER CELLULITE</em> <br>  <em>What is cellulite?</em>  <em>On the Internet, there is a wealth of information about creams and medicinal products that promise a miraculous cure for cellulite, but very little information about what this phenomenon is.</em> <br><br>  Cellulite, a granular formation similar to cottage cheese, accumulating mainly on the thighs, abdomen and buttocks, is just a beautiful name for subcutaneous fat deposited between the fibers of the connective tissue, which makes the skin a wrinkled orange peel.  To check if you have cellulite, squeeze the skin of the upper thigh.  If it becomes lumpy, then you have cellulite.  And you are not alone in your grief.  Cellulite has many girls and women, as well as some men - both young and old.  The degree of damage to the body by cellulite depends on several factors.  Genes, sex, fullness, age, skin thickness - all this affects the intensity of the formation of cellulite and its external manifestation. <br><br>  Whatever the reasons, it is important to know that there are no magic products, treatment methods and drugs that eliminate cellulite.  For example, the so-called deep massage method, which some fashion beauty salons promote as a panacea for cellulite, gives only a short-term effect, achieved due to the swelling of the skin.  And such treatments as liposuction or mesotherapy (injections or tablets that destroy cellulite) are either too expensive or only a temporary improvement. <br><br>  To get rid of cellulite, you must first get rid of excess fat deposits, and for this you should eat less calorie and fatty foods and move more.  According to experts, the main tool against cellulite - a system of physical exercises, which combines aerobics and power loads.  If you want to hide cellulite, use a cream for artificial tan, because on the dark skin cellulite is less noticeable. <br><br>  <strong>GOOSEBUMPS</strong> <br><br>  <em>Why does glass ‚Äúsqueal‚Äù when it is held by hand?</em> <br><br>  There are many cases where the action associated with wiping, causes high-frequency resonance, and usually the cause of this is intermittent friction.  When moving one surface in contact with another, friction impedes movement, but if you increase the shearing force, at some point it reaches a threshold where friction is overcome and smooth movement begins.  At this stage, the force that sets the movement of objects decreases and both surfaces begin to slide one over the other.  The elastic surface (eg, skin) deforms with increasing force.  When, as a result of friction, the pad of the finger brakes on the glass, its skin under the influence of force, which tends to move the finger from its place, is deformed, but with continued sliding, it again takes on an almost original appearance.  However, changes in the surface of the fingertip cause increased friction, the skin is again deformed and the movement of the finger is instantly inhibited.  With a uniform application of force, the skin surface is deformed hundreds of times per second, and as a result, audible sound waves arise. <br><br>  But why does friction create a similar effect?  Any surfaces, when viewed under a microscope, have a rough texture, and when they come into contact, only their highest points, the so-called protrusions, are in real contact.  These protrusions are closed and prevent movement.  If you increase the force of pressure, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtrue contact will increase, as any soft surface (for example, leather) is deformed, trying to more closely contact the irregularities of the other surface.  The frictional force that impedes movement increases.  As soon as the finger begins to slide, the bumps bounce off each other and interfere less with movement. <br><br>  <strong>Whip!</strong> <br><br>  <em>Is head beating really painful?</em>  <em>If so, how long does the severed head realize that it has been cut off?</em> <br><br>  How long does a person remain conscious after being beheaded?  In France, during the years of the reign of the guillotine, some of the condemned were asked to blink as long as they remained conscious after the knife fell down around their necks.  It is reported that after clipping the head blinked for up to 30 seconds, although it is difficult to say whether that was a nervous reflex, or if blinking occurred according to the will of the executed person.  In most countries where modern science could provide an answer to this question, punishment through truncation of the head has not been practiced as a legal punishment for a long time. <br><br>  <em>To be continued‚Ä¶</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18068/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18068/</a></p>
