This thought seemed slightly doubtful to me, and I agreed only on the condition that the investments would be minimal. </p><br><br><p>  After some time, everything was ready - we made the site on the finished CMS, pulled a sample, but customized design, filled the goods, and even started a little advertising.  The first orders went, but their quantity was clearly not enough to forget about the main work. </p><br><br><p>  And I started looking for ways to increase sales.  As previously agreed - free, or with minimal investment. </p>

    <p>  At about the same time, I paid attention to free callback services. </p><br><br><p>  Previously, it was full of callback order forms, but all of them just sent an e-mail to the mail of the site owner, and therefore their effectiveness was very low.  It has long been known that the probability of making a deal even after 10-15 minutes of waiting for a call tends to zero.  And because I did not consider such scripts, but was looking for something more interesting. </p><br><br><p>  As it turned out, there are not so many free callbacks.  Over the week, I tested three models of free callbacks that can be used for business ‚Äî the free versions of <a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect</a> and <a href="https://callbackhunter.com/">Callback Hunter</a> , as well as the <a href="https://callbackkiller.ru/">Callback Killer</a> service.  All of them differ from each other not only in appearance and functionality, but also in their working principle. </p><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddd/d84/aeb/dddd84aeb1994a4995e1d4e3d9cbbe92.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  CallbackHunter is free but useless </h2><br><p>  Yes, the most expensive kollbek in Russia has a free version, called the Black Edition. </p><br><br><p>  The first problem I faced before testing the free version was to get rid of 10 test calls.  In general, of course, it's great that they exist, but I was wondering how the free version works.  I had to order calls myself.  Since every call in the paid version of <a href="https://callbackhunter.com/">Callback Hunter was</a> accompanied by sms, I ran into an unexpected problem. </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d93/8ab/bf3/d938abbf36a14922bbdcb02158806cf4.png"></p><br><p>  <i>The design of the Callback Hunter 5.0 widget is in my opinion much more beautiful than the previous version.</i> </p><br><br><p>  From the description of the free version, I was confident that after ‚Äúshooting‚Äù test calls, I would just receive sms on my phone with a client number, and I could immediately call back.  But it was not there!  It turns out that Callback Hunter has a limit on sms-ki client, and I spent it all in the testing process! </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/249/c9f/14b/249c9f14b120490fb47b39e14d2e5ba1.png"></p><br>  <i>Free Callback Hunter tariff gives you only a few sms-juice with customer numbers per month.</i> <br><br><p>  After that, I was not happy even the ability to customize the color of the widget buttons in the free version.  Alas, I had to wait another month to test the free version of Callback Hunter.  And in any case, a dozen sms-approx a month is not serious. </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94f/8b2/36b/94f8b236bc8b4a508de1e019de59590d.png"></p><br>  <i>Callback Hunter's letters are beautiful, but their main motive comes down to ‚Äúpay us as soon as possible so as not to suffer.‚Äù</i> <br><br><p>  I had to admit that the free Callback Hunter widget is absolutely not viable for my purposes.  The specificity of a small business does not imply an individual employee who will sit in front of the monitor all day and wait for an e-mail. </p><br><br><p>  <b>Overall Rating:</b> 2/5 </p><br><p>  You can probably use it, but there are a lot of ill-considered moments.  The main task of the free version is to ‚Äúperekantovatsya‚Äù until the CallBack Hunter account is replenished. </p><br><br><p>  <b>The functionality of the free version:</b> 2/5 </p><br><p>  In the free version, the behavioral settings you made for the full version may remain, but what is the use of them in the free version? </p><br><p>  There is not even the simplest reports. </p><br><br><p>  <b>Ease of use of the free version:</b> 2/5 </p><br><p>  Unfortunately, the free CBH version actually turns out to be just a marketing ploy, and is not suitable for long-term use, because  it contains only a few sms-messages, the rest - by mail. </p><br><br><p>  <b>Widget design: 5/5</b> </p><br><p>  That looks like the widget is undeniably cool.  An additional plus is that in the free version it is possible to change the color of the widget. </p><br><br><p>  <b>The ability to contact the client within 1 min.</b>  <b>after ordering a callback: 1/5</b> </p><br><p>  The first few customers can still be saved, but when the sms limit for a month is over, the chance to get a satisfied buyer is sharply reduced. </p><br><br><h2>  Callback Killer - convenient, but not free </h2><br><p>  <a href="https://callbackkiller.ru/">Callback Killer</a> was the second free callback I tested.  Upon closer inspection, it turned out that one can only dream of being free in it. </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/528/df1/fb3/528df1fb3f0647bbaa8c928b222991d0.png"></p><br><p>  <i>This is what the expanded form looks like.</i>  <i>On the left is Callback Killer.</i>  <i>Right - Callback Hunter 3.0 Black (previous generation).</i> </p><br><br><p>  Callback Killer ads and blog posts just scream that they are ‚Äúthe first free callback service‚Äù.  They have a paid version of the widget for 750 rubles per month (in it, for example, you can adjust the color of the button), and free, where you do not need to pay for the widget.  But for telephony will have to pay there and there.  Each minute of conversation through a regular phone costs 4 rubles, and if through SiP it costs 2 rubles.  And this money, they say, goes exclusively to pay for communication. </p><br><br><p>  Such statements seem to me very strange.  Think for yourself - even in the usual tariffs of mobile operators, the cost of a minute of communication on a mobile phone is now well below 1 rub / minute, and within the network you can often talk for free.  Here we are talking about wholesale telephony purchases directly from providers!  And the price of it should be much lower. </p><br><br><p>  However, if there is a firm desire not to pay at all, you will have to constantly monitor the mailbox, since  when the money ends on balance, instead of calling, the owner of the site receives an e-mail with the client number: </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/859/89b/067/85989b067cd84da291ffa99786c96f11.png"></p><br><br><p>  In fact, this is no different from the old samopisnyh callback scripts, because of the low efficiency and uselessness of which automatic callbacks appeared, which immediately connect the site operator and the client.  If Callback Killer even sent an sms with customer number, it would be quite convenient.  But what is not - is not. </p><br><br><p>  Finally, it should be noted that Callback Killer has its own clone called <a href="http://pozvonim.com/">Pozvonim.com</a> .  Even the price of 4 rub / min is the same. </p><br><br><p>  <b>Overall Rating:</b> 2/5 </p><br><br><p>  <b>The functionality of the free version:</b> 2/5 </p><br><p>  Very poor functionality.  All interesting only in the paid version. </p><br><br><p>  <b>Ease of use of the free version:</b> 2/5 </p><br>  Sms this service in the free version does not send at all.  Strictly e-mail, which is very inconvenient.  But there are no reports. <br><br><p>  <b>Widget design: 3/5</b> </p><br><p>  The appearance of the Callback Killer number entry form almost completely copies that of the old Callback Hunter version.  There is no possibility to adjust the color of the widget. </p><br><br><p>  <b>The ability to contact the client within 1 min.</b>  <b>after ordering a callback: 1/5</b> </p><br><p>  And I‚Äôll repeat it again - work only through e-mail is ineffective and practically does not bring results, because the letter is very easy to miss and even easier to ignore. </p><br><br><h2>  Our choice is RedConnect.  Both free and convenient! </h2><br><p>  Fortunately, the first failures did not kill my interest.  After some time, I learned that there was a free version of <a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect</a> .  I am already well acquainted with the full version - after last year‚Äôs large-scale <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/15528/">research</a> , I chose it to be installed on the site of my main office. </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f34/931/702/f34931702f584aab9066b8d1156d5077.png"></p><br><p>  <i>The design of the free version differs from the older brother only by a more explicit copyright and the inability to adjust colors.</i>  <i>By the way, this form of widget appeared at RedConnect long before Callback Hunter.</i> </p><br><br><p>  At a cursory examination, at first I did not quite understand what was happening.  It seems like they offer a free version that will call ... And they won't even take a penny for it.  Honestly - I did not believe it.  I thought that the next tattoo, and somewhere the payment will surely pop up. </p><br><br><p>  I completely got into the essence of the service I only after watching the video: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bDWnYzpIRY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  For those who are lazy to watch the video I explain - they do not send SMS to the phone operator, and make an incoming call with the substitution of numbers.  The site operator sees on his screen exactly the number of the client to call.  It remains only to press one button. </p><br><br><p> It is difficult to come up with a simpler and more effective way to notify the manager that he has a new potential client.  It has long been known that the faster the customer will call back, the higher the probability of purchase.  It is easy to miss sms, e-mail is all the more so, but the sales assistant will hardly ignore the incoming call. </p><br><br><p>  It would seem - and what, in fact, the profit of the service developer?  I found the answer in their <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/redhelper/blog/20360/">article on Mega Brain</a> .  In a nutshell - their cost of telephony in this case is very insignificant, and they hope to repel them with the help of those who will eventually switch to the paid version.  Classic freemium in action. </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eee/47b/99b/eee47b99bd1442478b2b2863997a76ce.png"></p><br><p>  <i>I liked that after registration, you can immediately turn on the free rate, and not waste test calls.</i> </p><br><br><p>  Free RedConnect, of course, is not perfect.  For example, there is no possibility to customize the design of the button, and on the widget itself there is a noticeable copyright.  On the other hand, there may be an inscription ‚Äúfor free‚Äù, on the contrary, it attracts the visitor to order a call. </p><br><br><p>  The second minus is it is possible to enter only one phone.  If he suddenly turns out to be offline - you can get the client number only by e-mail.  Well, or in your account, but it is even longer.  SMS OK RedConnect also does not send. </p><br><br><p>  The third minus is the RedConnect managers, who will call for the first time and offer assistance in setting up and testing the paid version.  Fortunately, that quickly lag behind. </p><br><br><p>  However, these disadvantages are more than overlapped by many advantages.  Among which, for example, colorful and visual pdf-reports: </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/686/eb2/a6b/686eb2a6be444e75bd3746cbc85cb1a2.png"></p><br><p>  <i>You can customize the frequency of receiving reports.</i>  <i>It is immediately apparent from them who is tinkering and who is not.</i> </p><br><br><p>  And, you can upload your contact history to .xls along with phone numbers.  For example, to make a newsletter on them. </p><br><br><p>  Another interesting plus is user feedback.  After 30 seconds after ordering a call from the visitor, a window pops up asking "Have you called back?"  Agree, it is not always possible to call back immediately.  And here the widget itself gives explanations to the client, and promises that he will be contacted soon. </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99c/2a3/0ae/99c2a30ae5d44f8f9d2325527a903426.png"></p><br><p>  <i>The free version even has a review system.</i> </p><br><br><p>  <b>Overall rating:</b> 4/5 </p><br><br><p>  <b>The functionality of the free version:</b> 4/5 </p><br><p>  Compared with the full version - of course, a little.  Compared to other free versions, this is simply an enchanting freebie. </p><br><br><p>  <b>Ease of use of the free version:</b> 4/5 </p><br><p>  The fact that the widget is calling the operator is a huge plus.  But the sms-point would also not interfere. </p><br><br><p>  <b>Widget design: 4/5</b> </p><br><p>  The success of the widget's design is already indicated by the fact that it was first copied in Livetex'e, and then in Callback Hunter.  Minus point for not changing the color scheme of the widget. </p><br><br><p>  <b>The ability to contact the client within 1 min.</b>  <b>after ordering a callback: 4/5</b> </p><br><p>  With RedConnect, you can really quickly contact the customer in a matter of minutes after ordering a callback, and for this you don‚Äôt even need to build complex business process diagrams.  The score was reduced only for the lack of possibility to enter the second number. </p><br><br><h2>  Summing up and application results </h2><br><p>  Of the three tested services, only one turned out to be really useful - the free version of <a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect</a> .  The rest, despite their loud statements and promotion, are still not fully fit the definition of ‚Äúfree callback‚Äù - so that it is free, and the call. </p><br><br><p>  The concept of free versions of Callback Hunter and Callback Killer does not allow long and productive work.  To endure a few hours until the money reaches the account of the service is quite real.  But to use these versions on an ongoing basis is impossible due to technical limitations. </p><br><br><p>  <a href="https://callbackkiller.ru/">Callback Killer</a> really disappointed me.  There is no talk about free of charge, all loud statements actually turn into the need to constantly replenish the account.  Just like in <a href="https://callbackhunter.com/">Callback Hunter</a> , but at least at first he sends sms. </p><br><br><p>  The free version of RedConnect is significantly different.  It was originally created as a standalone product, aimed at long-term work.  Yes, she has limitations, but even with them it is quite possible to work effectively. </p><br><br><p>  Such a kollbek scheme is well suited for beginner sites whose owners are not so hot as with a budget.  For more or less large projects, where there are at least 2-3 sales managers, the existing functionality will be clearly not enough.  But this is a bummer - to have a large staff and save on callbacks. </p><br><br><p>  I am more than pleased with the free version of RedConnect.  Before installing the free callback, we received 10-15 regular calls per week.  Now 7-10 calls are added to them, already through the widget.  Conversion to calls also changed for the better, though not so strikingly.  Therefore, we do not plan to remove RedConnect from the site.  He does not ask for money, he looks pretty, he does his job.  What else do you need? </p><br><br><h2>  Are there any other alternatives? </h2><br><p>  Almost certainly, but I am not aware of them yet.  If you suddenly know some other free callback services (really free) - please share in the comments!  It will be interesting to test and compare them. </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299284/</a></p>
