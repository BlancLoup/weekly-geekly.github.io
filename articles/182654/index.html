    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Using alpha channel in PaintCAD 4Windows </h1><br>  It so happened that there are no layers in paintkade.  Here drawing is a ‚Äúpiece of paper‚Äù with a picture.  Therefore, there was never a question ‚Äúwhat is behind the picture?‚Äù.  Behind the picture is a background color (it‚Äôs the same as the background color, it‚Äôs also WZ).  All operations for cutting or shifting the pixels knew that they had to leave the empty places of the LC. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fc1/b6d/5ed/fc1b6d5ed0f358bd8ec4771405d7fe76.png"><br><br>  When the ancient Java mobile version of the paintkad was developed in the distant 200s, then, apart from the <b>Insert</b> , which inserted a copied rectangular fragment, the <b>special insert</b> appeared.  It was necessary to insert one picture onto another, while indicating the paintpad ‚Äútransparent color‚Äù, which was not inserted into the picture.  This all further moved to the windows for windows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a26/819/3d0/a268193d02184fc9aacec9457c485880.png"><br><br>  The transparent color was removed, the object was inserted, everyone was happy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/964/6c0/db6/9646c0db6ad1816ffeca3e84dcd91576.gif"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2cc/68d/788/2cc68d788c14ec100417e130dd36738e.gif"><br><br>  And so that they were even happier, it was possible to indicate with what transparency in percent to insert the remaining non-transparent piece of the picture: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/040/1ac/d26/0401acd266bc0295c6ac4cae369b2794.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/24a/1ca/b8e/24a1cab8ee272927427ca3ad60935470.gif"><br><br>  But after all these operations, the background image still remained opaque. <br><br>  In version 1.2.1 a <b>PNG</b> format was added to the command for opening any known paintkad file types (Ctrl + O, "??? - file").  And if the worktation feels that there is an alpha channel of transparency inside the file, then it will ask you: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b19/ad8/04e/b19ad804e201feead2e2a15d4ee0e05a.png"><br><br>  In order to load both the drawing and the alpha channel, you need to select the third item <b>‚ÄúPicture on drawing, alpha to buffer‚Äù</b> . <br><br>  Then here is a drawing on a transparent background: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dfa/9a3/3c8/dfa9a33c87b753c67cad35ec039522bd.png"><br><br>  will be decomposed in a paintkad into a picture (which will be in the picture) and an alpha channel (which will be in the internal paintkad buffer), on which the white pixels are completely opaque, the black pixels are completely transparent, the gray ones are intermediate gradations of transparency: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f6/6d1/9a7/3f66d19a70aabd6082860cce6b5212d2.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/682/f87/075/682f870750d15e28282e6e1550d155c1.png"><br><br>  And if then, when saving, you specify that we want to save ‚ÄúPNG‚Äù, then the paintcd will ask you once again about transparency: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1cf/5a7/a95/1cf5a7a95055087ff98d32e4dc5aa5fa.png"><br><br>  And when selecting <b>‚ÄúUse buffer as alpha channel‚Äù, the</b> PNG will be saved back along with its alpha channel. <br><br>  Accordingly, in <b>order to create a drawing with translucency from scratch, you need to copy your drawing to the buffer (Ctrl + C) and bring it up there in the buffer to the alpha channel condition</b> .  Therefore, it was necessary to quickly switch between the buffer and the pattern. <br><br>  Previously, such commands have already been added to the paintpad, this is the ‚ÄúPicture &lt;-&gt; Buffer‚Äù in the command menu by Ctrl + Right, and this is an exchange of the picture and buffer in the 3D stereo drawing mode.  But here it was necessary to duplicate this command once again, to make it accessible, easily started from the keyboard at any time, and to make it clear that it is ‚Äúto switch between the picture and the alpha channel‚Äù. <br><br>  Therefore, in the main menu (which is turned on when you press the "Menu" button in the upper left corner of the window or by pressing "0" on the keyboard) a whole new submenu <b>"Alpha"</b> was added <b>. The</b> first command in it appeared <b>"Figure &lt;-&gt; Buffer" ( Ctrl + D)</b> and now, using this keyboard shortcut, you can switch between the image and its alpha channel. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e91/a95/bc4/e91a95bc43da902138b4942c00013f5c.png"><br><br>  In the process of drawing I want to see "how my drawing will look on a transparent background."  Therefore, in the <b>Preview (F3)</b> , the <b>Alpha Overlay (D)</b> button was added, available for pressing when the buffer is not empty. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81d/f82/ec7/81df82ec7287cc9d69775a97b596ab9c.png"><br><br>  By clicking on this button or on the ‚ÄúD‚Äù key, you can preview not only a simple drawing, but a drawing superimposed with alpha on a black background, white background or a mesh background (which clearly shows how the transparency unfolds over a regular texture). <br><br>  Also, the user may want to impose this pattern with alpha on a specific background - for this, there is a second command in the Alpha menu: <b>‚ÄúOverlay alpha from the buffer on the drawing‚Äù</b> , which will offer you options that have backgrounds in addition to Black, White and Mesh backgrounds HRC and WZ: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe9/897/ed2/fe9897ed22cdedc949900a9bcd1581f8.png"><br><br>  But such an overlay option is rarely used, more often the user may want to take such a PNG with an alpha channel, load it, and then apply it to some other drawing. <br><br>  Since  there is only one drawing and one buffer in the paintkad, then if our PNG and its alpha channel are stored in them, then where should we put the drawing on which we want to paste the whole thing? <br><br>  To do this, in the menu "Alpha" are the last two commands. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúCapturing an image and alpha buffer for a special insert‚Äù (Ctrl + Shift + C)</b> - places the alpha channel in a special slot.  After that, the image is copied to the buffer.  And now the inserted image is in the buffer, its alpha channel is in the special slot.  The current picture is empty.  Open the picture, which will insert.  And we use a <b>special insert</b> (in the Selections and Clipboard menu, available via Alt + ".") - after Capture, she knows that she does not need to ask anything about transparency, you just need to use an alpha channel from a special slot. <br><br>  Thus, we put our PNG with alpha channel on any other image: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c36/d50/3b5/c36d503b5ee11a05535996bb987b9c01.png"><br><br>  As soon as we‚Äôve finished inserting a picture with an alpha channel, we need to cancel the capture so that the Special Ensemble starts working as usual again, for this we call the <b>‚ÄúCancel Capture‚Äù</b> command in the Alpha menu <b>(Ctrl + Shift + X)</b> . <br><br>  Thus, in PaintCAD 4Windows, you can draw pictures with translucency, load them from PNG, save to PNG and paste them into other pictures. <br><br><h1>  Video editing in PaintCAD 4Windows </h1><br>  Earlier, in the mobile version of the paintkad, the packer of animated GIFs was written.  And so the concept of "Video" in the paintkad did not exist, there was only GIF-animation.  It was possible to collect animations from GIF frames and parse them into GIF frames. <br><br>  All this work with GIFs was also transferred to the paintpad for windows and was always in the Utilities menu: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f4/333/590/4f43335901dcc7344297f88ea7590f33.jpg"><br><br>  Animated GIFs have a feature: each frame can have any delay.  There is no concept of "FPS" or "Number of frames per second": <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b3/cc3/f45/7b3cc3f45f511ea84ce484e10741012d.png"><br>  (frames for video and animations are stored in separate files in the paintpad, for example, there are 1000 GIF frames in a folder - and you can collect one GIF animation from them) <br><br>  When rewriting a paintkad under windows, the ability to build AVI video files from BMP / JPG frames was added.  And here the problem was designated - <b>you cannot just take and hold one of the frames of the AVI file</b> . <br><br>  In addition, the frames in paintkad are named simply 1.bmp, 2.bmp, 3.bmp .... 9.bmp, 10.bmp ... 99.bmp, 100.bmp, etc., and for example , hold the third frame in AVI for a second at a playback speed of 24 frames per second - you need to duplicate it from 3.bmp to 26.bmp, and for all frames that were ahead - increase the names in the file names by 24. <br><br>  Therefore, a video editing tool was very necessary to process long sequences of frames.  And in version 1.2.1 it appeared. <br><br>  And because of it even the whole structured menu <b>‚ÄúUtilities‚Äù appeared - ‚ÄúProcessing BMP / JPG frames‚Äù</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/efd/dff/491/efddff491b96abdc126daa00a5332294.png"><br><br>  The first item in this menu is <b>‚ÄúView Queue (Ctrl + J)‚Äù</b> - and there is a call to the video editing utility.  After calling this item and selecting one of the BMP / JPG files-frames of your sequence, the window for viewing and editing the frame sequence will appear: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/551/0b8/78b/5510b878b7b36c50d31b9766699c2962.png"><br><br>  From left to right in the bottom of the window is the queue itself.  On each frame is written his name and the time of his show.  If you hold down <b>Shift</b> , then instead of the time on each frame its mini-image will be displayed. <br><br>  The image at the top left of the window is scaled to fit this preview area. <br><br>  The top right of the window shows the information: the file name of the frame, the frame size in pixels, the current playback speed in frames per second, the length of the current selection (the beginning-end of the selection), a segment of the sequence of frames copied to the buffer. <br><br>  The user can easily run through the frame by cursor (just run 1 frame, hold <b>Q</b> - 10 frames, <b>A</b> - 100 frames, <b>Z</b> - 1000 frames, <b>W</b> - 10,000 frames per step), select part of the frame queue, copy or move it, take a freeze-frame (tighten one frame), insert an empty gap (by moving the remaining frames in front) and much more <b>(for more details, see the assignment of buttons below)</b> .  At the end after editing the sequence, you can play the selected section and the entire sequence as a whole.  And then collect it in AVI and run it on the default player to play AVI on your system. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Purpose of buttons in the video editing window</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>F2</b> - stretches the window to full screen to be better visible. <br><br>  <b>C / C (F)</b> - calls the window for setting the number of frames per second for future animation (from 1 to 30 fps). <br><br>  <b>Previous (LEFT) and Next (RIGHT)</b> - moves the cursor through the sequence frames. <br><br>  <b>Go (G)</b> - brings up the menu of choosing the place of transitions.  You can go to the nearest sequence break backward or forward, to the end of the animation backward or forward or to a specific frame (then you need to enter the frame number). <br><br>  <b>Edit (ENTER)</b> - opens the frame, on which the cursor is, in the paintkad through ‚ÄúOpen ???‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Selection (SPACE)</b> - starts / finishes selecting a segment of a sequence.  If you apply twice on one frame - the selection is reset and it is considered that it is in the current position of the cursor and is 1 frame long (moves with the cursor movement). <br><br>  <b>Copy (Ctrl + C)</b> - remembers the selected segment of the sequence <br><br>  <b>Paste (Ctrl + V)</b> - transfers a copy of the previously copied ‚ÄúCopy (Ctrl + C)‚Äù segment of the sequence to a new location, the first frame of the segment is placed where the cursor is. <br><br>  <b>Move (Ctrl + B)</b> - transfers a copy of the sequence cut by the ‚ÄúCopy (Ctrl + C)‚Äù function to a new place; the first frame of the segment is placed where the cursor is.  The old location of the segment is cleared of frames (that is, frames are transferred to the new location). <br><br>  <b>Delete (Ctrl + X)</b> - the selected segment of the sequence is cleared from the frames after the user confirms the operation. <br><br>  <b>Lose (P)</b> - starts playback of a sequence of frames with the set "K / S (F)" speed.  If a segment of a sequence is selected, then there is an endless looped playback of this segment. <br><br>  <b>Load queue (L)</b> - launches a file open dialog to select an editable sequence.  In this way, you can switch to editing a different frame sequence in another folder. <br><br>  <b>Effects (E)</b> - brings up the menu for selecting effects for the selected frame segment.  The following effects are available: <br><ul><li>  Shift / copy - shift or copy selected sequence of frames. </li><li>  Freeze frame - if one frame is selected, it requests the length of the freeze frame and stretches this frame to the selected length (erasing everything that gets in its path), and if a segment of the sequence is selected, it spreads the first frame of the selected segment throughout the sequence. </li><li>  Multistop frame - smears each Nth frame over the remaining (N-1) frames ahead of itself; the output is a ‚Äúslowing down‚Äù video, in which frames rarely change. </li><li>  Reverse - changes the location of frames of the selected segment to the opposite (the first frame of the selection will be the last). </li><li>  Repeat - repeats the selected segment of the sequence the selected number of times. </li><li>  Random blend - randomly shuffles frames in a selected segment of a sequence. </li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãup / slow down - stretches / compresses the selected segment of the sequence to the specified length (in frames). </li><li>  Insert empty gap - inserts the selected number of empty frames into the current cursor position, shifting the entire part of the animation that is ahead. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Make AVI (R)</b> - causes the assembly of AVI-video from a sequence of frames.  For successful assembly, it is necessary that at least the first frame be (1.bmp / ‚Äã‚Äã1.jpg). <br><br>  <b>Show AVI (S)</b> - opens the last compiled AVI in your video player (installed on the system by default for playing AVI files). <br><br>  <b>Exit (ESC)</b> - closes the frame queue view window.  When you next call the window - it will immediately open with the display of the selected previous frame queue.  To change the frame queue to another - use the Load queue button (L). <br></div></div><br>  <b>The remaining menu items ‚ÄúProcessing BMP / JPG frames‚Äù</b> are intended for additional tasks, such as converting GIF frames to BMP / JPG frames and vice versa, carrying out batch processing of frames with effects like Brightness, Contrast, multiple image enlarger Extender (with the possibility of using different algorithms like advMame2x , advMame3x, simple zoom, etc.), Frame cropping, Resizing frames, Renaming third-party frames to 1.bmp, 2.bmp format and back. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Functions of the menu items Processing BMP / JPG frames</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Batch processing</b> - applies to all frames (from the first frame 1.bmp / ‚Äã‚Äãjpg to the nearest gap or end of the sequence if there is nothing behind the gap) of the selected sequence one of the effects: <br><ul><li>  1. Color, Contrast, Brightness, Color, Gamma - parameters are selected by the user and apply to all frames; </li><li>  2. Expander - any of the variants of this effect of increasing the size of the image in all frames; </li><li>  3. Fragment - cuts all frames of the sequence on the current selection.

At the same time, rename.rnl is created in the frame folder, in which old and new file names are written. </li><li>  ‚ÄúReturn names by RNL-list‚Äù - using the rename.rnl file created earlier, frame files are renamed back to their old names. </li></ul><br></div></div><br><br><h1>  Video editing: parsing AVI on frames </h1><br>  The same video editing interface, but with reduced capabilities (because it is impossible to move frames in avi as easily as frame files can be moved on the hard drive), is shown to the user if you call <b>‚ÄúDisassemble AVI video into BMP / JPG frames‚Äù</b> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/184/a8d/fd0/184a8dfd0856e91062ba9b4cc2ada40c.png"><br><br>  Then the frame queue shows just the frame numbers (and not the files), you can also navigate through them, play them, import a specific frame into a paintkad, merge a selected frame range onto a hard disk.  In this case, the information panel shows the total number of frames in the AVI file, the speed (FPS) of the open video, the frame size in the video. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f59/d2c/4e4/f59d2c4e451d5fe08d77aadbdad629c7.png"><br><br>  On average, a normal one and a half- (two-) hour film at 24 frames per second is about 130-170 thousand frames.  Therefore, moving along it (for example, holding the above <b>W</b> - 10 thousand frames per step) is quite easy. <br><br>  Thus, you can pull out the necessary frames from AVI, then use the menu ‚ÄúProcessing BMP / JPG frames‚Äù to cut them, make them in the required size, convert them into GIFs and make, <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">for example, an animated avatar:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df3/e08/310/df3e083103d887d147158427ba441a06.gif"><br></div></div><br><br><h1>  PaintCAD 4Windows Mosaic Editor </h1><br>  In the "Utilities" menu there is another interesting menu - <b>"Mosaic Editor"</b> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/934/ece/095/934ece095d273f2723a267996a855d01.png"><br><br>  The first item on this menu is <b>‚ÄúMosaic View (Ctrl + Y)‚Äù</b> , it requests one of the mosaic tile files (described below) and then shows the editor window: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/14d/cd6/46d/14dcd646de483501c2878889ff4c371d.gif"><br><br>  <b>A mosaic</b> is a set of two-dimensional square or rectangular elements (tiles) of the same size ("tile set") that can be connected to each other into a single image, drawing in this way, for example, a map for playing with roads, rivers and lakes, forests and seas. sands and lava.  You can also draw beautiful borders for tables that you later use on web pages. <br><br>  It is difficult to draw tiles as separate pictures, because it is necessary to keep in mind in which place the tile elements are connected to form a single picture.

You can edit each element of the mosaic individually or in the environment of other elements in order to draw high-quality joints with them (and then save this element separately, see below for more details. <b>‚ÄúAppointment of buttons in the mosaic editor window‚Äù - ‚ÄúImport matrix (CTRL + ENTER)‚Äù</b> ) .  After saving the corrected element, we return to the mosaic editor and once again check that everything is fine with it.

To do this: 1) load a map into the pinkcard; 2) call this function and specify one of the sorted mosaic elements (it is possible to work with unsorted elements, but it will be longer, because there are more of them). As a result, at the end of the function, a mosaic editor is opened in which the recognized matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãvisible (layout of elements):</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e8b/4d4/6ab/e8b4d46ab1a2d962bb2b93eb9eddb78b.gif"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The resulting layout can be saved and used along with the elements themselves, for example, in their own game about tanks. Although of course it is better to draw your own elements, to plagiarize is not good. Yes, and in the game about tanks, in fact (most likely), the card consists of much smaller pieces (8x8 pixels or a quarter of our 16x16 received, although in the map editor in tanks there are 16x16 elements used - they crumble the tank ammunition not entirely, but bit by bit, bricks generally crumble into small pieces). So you can try to do the same with this card with an emphasis on 8x8 elements.</font></font><br><br><h1>  Epilogue </h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now you know how to create your translucent PNG drawing in PaintCAD 4Windows, collect and edit your AVI animation from BMP / JPG frames, pull frames from any AVI file and even draw your own mosaic and create a map layout for your game. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For those who first learned about PaintCAD 4Windows graphics editor:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> at the moment it weighs 10879 KBytes and lies at </font></font><a href=""><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">blackstrip.ru/pcw.rar</font></font></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182654/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182654/</a></p>
