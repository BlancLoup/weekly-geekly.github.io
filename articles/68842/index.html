  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Asus Eee PC 1005HA or the story of a single SSD</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day comrade! <br><br>  By writing this article I was prompted by problems with the upgrade of my Asus Eee PC 1005HA.  At the same time I decided to post a photo report of the disassembly of this device and a couple of tips on avoiding possible problems for luperient comrades.  I hope this will serve someone or something good. <br>  Next, a lot of beeches and a lot of pictures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To work, I needed a small and lightweight device that can be carried along with me without any problems, and which would have a long battery life.  After reviewing the various options, I settled on the Asus Eee PC 1005HA.  Small (but with an acceptable screen for work), lightweight and tenacious.  For it, there are 3 types of batteries: <br>  1. 4400mAh ??? <br>  2. 5800mAh 63Wh <br>  3. 8700mAh 63Wh <br><br>  For some reason, there was no 8700mAh battery aboard the epiships, so I ordered it separately.  This model has a satatny screw of 160GB, and in order to be at the peak of progress and <s>learn Zen,</s> slightly increase the battery life, I decided to plug a SSD screw there.  At first I decided to take the device in USB-version with SATA-interface, tear it up and insert the screw into the laptop.  But then I was told that there are ‚Äúspecial SSDs for the Eee PC‚Äù at the same price, and it was decided to take it.

      * Oh, if only we knew what was around the bend, <br>  And to know where to lay the straw ... * ¬© balamut.uz <br><br>  And now the joyful moment has arrived, now I am the owner of a new 64GB SSD screw!  The soul sings, and my legs carry me home.  Well, it's time to start preparing the patient.  To do this, we need <s>a</s> thin <s>hammer</s> shaped screwdriver and a paper knife to move the clips and pry off the keyboard, as well as the hero of the day - a new flash screw.  Open the box with the words ‚ÄúExpansion SSD‚Äù and ‚ÄúCompatible with ASUS Eee PC‚Äù and get IT: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/35d/421/9e8/35d4219e8299f9c1bd78d7b73809368e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Hmm ... the connector seems to be smaller than Satashny, but for a long time I haven‚Äôt been picking on iron, can I confuse what? <br><br>  To begin, unscrew all the bolts in the bottom of the laptop.  Open the cover hiding the memory and then unscrew another tricky bolt.  There are side latches on the lid, so we don‚Äôt pull it hard, pick it up and open it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/35d/421/9e8/35d4219e8299f9c1bd78d7b73809368e.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/35d/421/9e8/35d4219e8299f9c1bd78d7b73809368e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Now put the patient in a normal position and remove the clave.  To do this, above the keys F1, F6, F10 and Insert, press the latches and pick up the keyboard, pull it out.  Start better on the left side.  It is easier and safer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/35d/421/9e8/35d4219e8299f9c1bd78d7b73809368e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  After the top of the keyboard is raised, we are not in a hurry to pull it, because  You can tear off the connecting cable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/35d/421/9e8/35d4219e8299f9c1bd78d7b73809368e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  See the black figovinu comrade?  So, first you need to push it out like a box from the table, so that it would be like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/35d/421/9e8/35d4219e8299f9c1bd78d7b73809368e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  and only after that you can pull out the train. <br><br>  Next, unscrew these 6 bolts (marked with blue and red): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/35d/421/9e8/35d4219e8299f9c1bd78d7b73809368e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Particular attention is paid to the bolt marked in red.  Yes, yes, my friend, the guarantee of <s>Piz ...</s> you no longer have: "(But where we did not disappear. Continue, pray. Next, you need to disconnect one more loop, so as not to lose the touchpad (marked in orange in the previous photo).) differently than with the keyboard. This connector does not slide out, but rises up. Without extra effort, we hook the black darn and the vuyal ‚Äî the cable is now easily pulled out. When opened, the clip looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/35d/421/9e8/35d4219e8299f9c1bd78d7b73809368e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Gently pry with a fingernail (or something else, like) a lid and remove it.  And here they are the insides of the <s>monster-monsters of</s> our pet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/35d/421/9e8/35d4219e8299f9c1bd78d7b73809368e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Tax ... now we need to remove the screw and replace it with ssd.  but first we remove the interfering wires.  The principle is already familiar to us - we raise the clamp and pull out the train.  Unscrew one bolt and take out the screw.  And here we are waiting <s>for one more magnus ... n an</s> unpleasant surprise - the connector for ssd doesn‚Äôt turn out to be at all :( and having a look at what we have there from the devices, we see something that is not like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/35d/421/9e8/35d4219e8299f9c1bd78d7b73809368e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Md  mini pci-e with WiFi stuck.  This is a bummer.  But maybe there is another such port on the mother?  Above, no, maybe the bottom?  No, comrade, I'm afraid you will be disappointed.  Below there is no connector to plug at least something useful.  Fully unscrew the motherboard, I did not, so there is no pictures.  Instead of a wifa screw, it will not work either - the speaker is in the way.  Yes, and nothing to it, you need a wifi no less. <br>  So, what we have: <br>  1. Useless screw on the hands; <br>  2. Lost Warranty; <br>  3. Experience disassembling bourgeois device; <br>  4. Desire for something about something <s>...</s> break it; <br><br>  Here is such a sad result of my story.  Although it is still possible to pass the ballast back to the store. <br><br>  And about the netbook itself I can say the following: <br>  Pros: <br>  1. Declared 10 hours of battery life.  And it works.  True without Wi-Fi, bluetooth and with minimal brightness.  But in the ‚ÄúPower Saving Mode‚Äù mode, 80% of the screen brightness and WiFi on honestly work 7-8 hours (and this is on a 5800mAh battery). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/35d/421/9e8/35d4219e8299f9c1bd78d7b73809368e.gif" alt="image"><br>  2. Multi-touchpad.  Work is declared in 3 or 4 applications, but it works with me and in browsers also in non-standard image viewers and in the office.  In general, cool chip. <br>  3. Small, light, comfortable <br><br>  Minuses: <br>  1. Klava is somewhat noisy <br>  2. Arrow keys are uncomfortable <br>  3. If the cooler starts, it makes a noise <br><br>  I also found some kind of incomprehensible joint in Claudia - the left part of the space and the left alto, as it were, are ‚Äúpuffed up‚Äù and clearly rise above the rest of the keys.  I could not bring them back to normal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/35d/421/9e8/35d4219e8299f9c1bd78d7b73809368e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  That's it.  And may the force be with you, young Jedi ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68842/</a></p>
