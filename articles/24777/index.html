After some improvements and processing, <a href="http://moyfotomir.ru/">moyfotomir.ru has</a> become a little prettier, more interesting and more functional.  The graphic design of the site has been completely redone.  Introduced new functionality using Google maps API - geotag photos on the world map.  With this feature you can significantly expand your creativity as a traveler-researcher.  Add tags of your photos of geographical locations on the map, the more accurately you specify the place, the more interesting it will be for everyone who will use this service as a photo search for images of the desired place on the map. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  When registering a new user or editing a profile, we entered three new fields <b>‚ÄúCountries where I was‚Äù</b> , <b>‚ÄúResorts where I was‚Äù</b> and <b>‚ÄúHotels where I was‚Äù</b> .  These are your travel preferences, for which you can find on our website those travelers who have indicated the same preferences for countries, resorts and hotels!  With this functionality, you can find new friends and discuss interesting moments of travel. <br>  Added the ability to subscribe to various RSS feeds, including the latest news, latest photos, the best photos, and of course your travel reviews.  Now subscribing to these feeds, you can keep track of all the latest updates on the site.  I also want to note that an important achievement was the integration of our photo galleries into the PicLens 3D slideshow viewer (http://piclens.com), who still do not know what it is, I advise you to definitely see and install it in view of a plug-in for IE, Opera and FireFox.  PicLens supports searching for main photo hosting sites, including Picasa, Flickr, Yahoo, Photobucket, SmugMug and Deviant Art. <br>  Now the second issue of our unusual social online magazine, created on the basis of photographs, stories and stories of travelers, is in the layout stage.  Judging by the reviews, the first issue of ‚ÄúMyPhotoMir.ru‚Äù magazine (http://moyfotomir.ru/img/MoyFotoMir-1.pdf 16mb) was very popular with all users of our community, and we also received many enthusiastic comments from users of tourist communities on Mail .ru, where our magazine was presented.  Therefore, we will try very hard, and continue to please you only with the most interesting and truthful information about travel and tourism, and you will help us with this! <br>  Well, now about the hard work of a startup ... <br>  As always, in such cases, there is enough funding to implement all the ideas for bringing the project to full condition and to promote the project on the Internet.  Many people who read our first issue of the magazine ‚ÄúMyPhotoMir.ru‚Äù say that they would like to buy or subscribe to the print version of this magazine, many say that they would be happy to take part in the development of the magazine, but soon they need some kind of incentive ... <br>  For the development of the project and the magazine in particular, some kind of motivation of users is required, in the form of prizes or sponsorship gifts, and for this, again, there is not enough finance and proper website promotion on the Internet. <br>  And advertisers would be useful to us, because we have developed a very useful platform for broadcasting advertisements on the tourist map of the world, and also introduced the possibility of broadcasting advertisements in the context of photo labels on the map, and feedback labels on the map!  Plus, there would probably be interesting advertising space in the magazine itself, because the magazine provides first-hand information, which is doubly interesting;) <br>  Dear habrokes, gurus of Internet projects and startups, tell me how to further promote the project, where to go and in general how to proceed, in what direction to move? <br>  Now we are really treading water :( <br>  Or maybe this stillborn project?  Please do not kick much, but talk about the case ... <br>  Thank you, we hope for your support. </div>
