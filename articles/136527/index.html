Hello, friends! <br>  Happy holidays! <br><br>  The year 2011 is over and, looking around, we can say that this year has passed successfully for us. <br><br>  We have strengthened our position among the five largest consumer electronics manufacturers, retained leadership in the categories of home appliances and air conditioners, in just one year we have bypassed two competitors and have become global No. 2 on the TV market.

      We also released a lot of innovative models of technology and entered new markets for domestic lighting and B2B equipment. <br><br>  In Russia, we strengthened our position as a consumer electronics brand number 2, significantly strengthening our position in the segment of 2D and 3D flat-panel TVs. <br><br>  Now is the time to set goals for 2012, our post will be dedicated to them. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/thumbs/lg.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Home Entertainment (TVs, audio systems, multimedia technology)</b> . <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/thumbs/lg2.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúLG is planning to consolidate the strong association '3D = LG', taking the leading position in the global 3D TV market.  Not less ambitious plans for the company and in relation to the sphere of Smart TV, where LG is constantly improving its platform called NetCast.  For confident positioning of the company as the number one player in the production of TVs, LG will continue to develop the technologies of all TV lines, such as LCD TVs, and new generation products such as OLED TVs and ultra-high definition televisions (UD), ‚Äùsays Havis Kwon, Chief Executive Officer and President, LG Home Entertainment. <br><br>  <b>Goal 1. Become the global No. 1 in the 3D TV market</b> . <br><br>  The release of televisions using an alternative polarization technology for generating 3D images - FPR has allowed us to significantly strengthen our position and become the leader of the segment.  We do not intend to rest on our laurels and are planning to bring technology to a new level. <br><br>  More than 70% of LG's new TVs will be equipped with Cinema 3D technology, new TVs will have more advanced software solutions for high-quality 3D image optimization and full elimination of negative effects. <br><br>  We will also update the unique Cinema 3D polarized glasses, not only in terms of design, but also in terms of polarization. <br><br>  <b>Goal 2. Strengthen leadership in the Smart TV segment at both the global and local levels</b> . <br><br>  The total number of Russian services available on LG TVs makes us the leader in the number of local partners among Internet TV manufacturers.  In 2012, we intend to retain leadership in this segment throughout the year, thanks to the massive introduction of services and new local applications - VoD.  Also, for developers of smart TV applications, special tools will be opened for creating 3D applications. <br><br>  We are continuing to work on forming a pool of strategic partners with regard to 3D content, so that owners of CINEMA 3D Smart TVs can enjoy the widest choice of 3D video / applications. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/2vev.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At CES, held in January in Las Vegas, the Google TV platform was presented, which will be used on our televisions in 2012. <br><br>  You can view the presentation here: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/odWCUqn_0K0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhglFbNL4THh-0vWb5vdZ1bS4WrtsQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Goal 3. Optimize production costs and make flat panel TVs from 42 inches and above more affordable to the mass consumer</b> . <br><br>  Everything is simple and difficult at the same time: 2012 will be the year of optimization of the cost price of TV panels.  We plan to reduce our own production costs, which ultimately will affect the reduction of final prices for products and give us a competitive advantage and an increase in market share. <br><br>  These will be our televisions in 2012-&gt; <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/3awa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Goal 4. To bring to the mass market OLED 3D panels, as well as new TV sets with a resolution of UHD</b> . <br><br>  At the last consumer electronics exhibition CES, we presented two innovative products in the category of 3D TVs. <br><br>  The first one is the largest OLED 3D panels in the world with stunning color reproduction, the most contrast display, crystal clear picture and the highest frequency.  A pleasant addition is also the dimensions of the TV panel, because its thickness is only 4 millimeters, and weight - 7.5 kg. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/4tdt.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The second innovative product was 3D panels - Ultra High Definition. <br><br>  84inch UHD 3D TVs with a unique, unprecedented screen resolution of 8 million pixels (3840 √ó 2160), which is 4 times the highest resolution of current Full HD LED TVs.  Televisions also work on Cinema 3D technology and have Smart TV functionality. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/5twt.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And, most importantly, OLED and UHD-panels are not test samples, their mass sales will begin in the second half of 2012.  We plan to sell more than 250,000 OLED TVs in 2012, thereby securing leadership in this so-called "non-competitive" segment. <br><br>  <b>Home Appliances (washing machines, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens and other household appliances)</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúCompetition is becoming more intense, but we are confident that an active investment strategy and progressive development of technologies with solid growth potential will enable us to raise standards in the home appliance market,‚Äù says Moon-bam Shin, executive vice president of LG Electronics Home Appliance. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/6sks.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to the program adopted for 2012, we expect to increase the sales of household appliances twice (compared to 2011) and become the world cross-category ‚Ññ1 in the segment of ‚Äúwhite‚Äù appliances by 2014. <br><br>  <b>Objective 1. Strengthen business platform optimization, production and logistics in the production of household appliances</b> . <br><br>  Despite the fact that we occupy a leading position in the field of "white" household appliances around the world, our strategic goal in 2012 is to maintain a consistently high quality of production and optimize logistics costs and production costs of equipment. <br><br>  <b>Objective 2. To secure the technical advantage in the categories of washing machines and refrigerators</b> . <br><br>  In our arsenal there are patents for technologies such as Direct Drive, No Frost, Linear Compressor, Light Wave, and many other complex technological patents for hardware solutions in household appliances. <br><br>  We are a leader in terms of innovative solutions and plan to use this advantage both through marketing communications (in order to convey knowledge about technology to the mass consumer), and through the development of new technologies in key products. <br><br>  Therefore, in 2012 you will see a lot of high-profile advertising campaigns and presentations of new technologies! <br><br>  Flagships of household appliances lines of 2012 -&gt; <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/7fkf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Goal 3. Mass introduction of LG Thinq technology and smart devices in everyday household appliances</b> . <br><br>  Introduction of smart, convenient and practical solutions to the mass market of home appliances is our key priority in a long-term strategy.  For 5 years, we plan to make every third home in developed countries become a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù home. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/8eie.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Mobile Communications (mobile phones, smartphones, tablets)</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúA few years ago we were known as a company that produces‚Äú ficher backgrounds ‚Äù(telephones sharpened for one key direction, note camera phone).  Last year we became a company that produces smartphones.  Our next goal is to become the number 1 company in the field of LTE / 4G smartphones.  In 2012, we plan that sales of LTE smartphones will be at least 50% of the sales of all smartphones ‚Äù- Executive President of LG Electronics Mobile Communications. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/9idi.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Objective 1. To occupy the niche of 4G (LTE) smartphones</b> . <br><br>  As a patent leader in 4G communications and a leading developer of high-speed data, we set ourselves an ambitious task - to occupy the niche of LTE smartphones, get ahead of the trend and become the main brand serving this niche. <br>  4G = LG <br><br>  <b>Objective 2. To improve the quality of technical support for our products</b> . <br><br>  According to the results of 2011, we identified a number of problems associated with the technical support of our equipment. <br><br>  In 2012, we plan to fix all current problems, both in terms of service and technical support, and in terms of software product support (create new firmware, provide remote product support (remote connection to smartphones). <br><br>  <b>Goal 3. To keep the innovation trend in smartphones - to increase strategic innovations in display technologies, as well as to develop the production of mobile chipsets</b> . <br><br>  2011 has made it clear that the future of the industry lies with manufacturers offering technologically innovative products.  Consumer preferences shifted in favor of high-quality high-tech displays, as well as high-performance chipsets, so in 2012 we plan to focus our efforts on creating smartphones that meet these needs. <br><br>  That's all for now. <br>  Best wishes for the new year. <br><br>  Your team is LG. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136527/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136527/</a></p>
