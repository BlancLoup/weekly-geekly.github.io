  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Buxter: a new application on Facebook</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Prehistory: <br>  Facebook users have the opportunity to exchange cash payments directly using the new application Buxter.  The new development conducts transactions in euros or US dollars, in the next month transfers in British pounds will be launched.  Other currencies can also be downloaded to Buxter, while a 5% commission will be charged for conversion, according to TechCrunch.  To use Buxter, you need an account on ClickAndBuy. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For a start, it makes sense to say a few words about the "alignment of forces" and, in general, the background of this news.  The social network Facebook (as of February 2010) has more than 300 million users.  In addition to the standard features of a social network (messaging, uploading photos, and so on), Facebook actively promotes applications within itself.  Applications are very different - for example, a variety of games and entertainment.  Also, the social network has an internal currency - in the Russian translation they were called ‚ÄúFacebook points‚Äù.  Facebook points can be purchased from a bank card or from a PayPal account.  Points are used to purchase virtual gifts and access games on Facebook.

      Buxter is a Facebook application made by ClickandBuy payment system (http://clickandbuy.com). ClickandBuy has existed since 1999, the company's website reports 13 million users and 16 million connected online stores. <br><br>  Facebook points are, in essence, a payment system.  Creating a payment system inside is a perfectly logical step for a social network that has gained an audience.  Why?  Will explain.  A social network (and indeed any project with a large audience) understands very well that sooner or later money will start to ‚Äúgo‚Äù among users.  So this "walk" can be organized in at least two ways - "in white" or ... not in white. <br><br>  The organization of the turnover ‚Äúin white‚Äù is most often the merit of the service itself (You can‚Äôt stop the revolution - lead it!), The turnover is not ‚Äúin white‚Äù - most likely it is the initiative of users.  And I assure you, there is no doubt that if the service ‚Äúslows down‚Äù or does not pay attention to the organization of turnover within the service - users will do it for him.  But how they do it is another story ... <br><br>  The conclusion is obvious: if you want order inside your service, make the necessary opportunities, in particular, to replenish your account to pay for games and gifts yourself.  Make it convenient and safe. <br><br>  For an example, you need to go far to it - Mail.Ru led the revolution at home and made his own payment service, Mail@Mail.Ru.  The main task of Money @ Mail.Ru is to solve the pressing problems of Mail.Ru users - payments to Mail.Ru applications and various services.  Users, in turn, appreciate an attentive attitude. <br><br>  What does the Buxter app allow Facebook users to do? <br><br>  - send money to another Facebook user <br>  - receive money from other Facebook users <br>  - request money from Facebook users <br>  - withdraw money to your ClickandBuy account <br>  - replenish your Buxter account from your ClickandBuy account <br>  - pay for apps on Facebook <br><br>  Of course, all this is great, but I did not see any solutions to any new problems.  Is there a problem transferring money to another user?  Hardly.  The vast majority of users have a PayPal account, so there are no difficulties.  With the receipt of money the question is exactly the same.  Depositing and withdrawing funds into ClickandBuy is a great opportunity, absolutely necessary for the ClickandBuy payment system.  As for Facebook in this situation - hardly.  Finally, ClickandBuy‚Äôs experience inspires confidence (after all, more than 10 years on the market) and gives hope that the company is able to solve security issues for its users and online stores. <br><br>  To summarize: Facebook is one of the largest social networks on a global scale.  Making it possible to pay for services within the network is convenient and safe - a completely logical step.  However, I perceive Buxter as ‚Äúone more opportunity to send or receive money, no more.  In general, it is likely that the application from ClickandBuy we will see other applications for Facebook of this kind, and we will watch the fate of Buxter as the ‚Äúfirstborn‚Äù. <br><br>  ps <br>  Based on the <a href="http://www.itogi.ru/hitech-trend/2010/13/150480.html">column</a> : the material is not all out - did not allow the format of the column. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89361/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89361/</a></p>
