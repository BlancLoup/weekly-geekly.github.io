Or not ... maybe the opposite, a bad start leads to an unexpected ending? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My story will begin in the winter of 2009, the year the global crisis reached everyone I could.  When, when the company urgently needed to automate the work with the main vendor. <br><br>  <b>Winter 2009</b> <br>  A small IT department of a company of 3 employees was given the task of creating a miracle.  You need to write an ERP system for the company.  And the miracle was created.  The main core of the system was written in less than a month, after which they started creating documents. <br><br>  <b>Summer 2009</b> <br>  The inventory accounting system was implemented not on the knee, no, it was created in the warehouse, on the logistician‚Äôs desktop.  An unforgettable event, the box with the details has already been printed, the documents for receiving the goods are decorated, the car is gone, and you think why it is impossible to print a sticker to stick it on the package.

      <b>Fall 2009</b> <br>  Details will be credited to the warehouse, glued (sometimes several times) and sent to service centers. <br>  Everything that comes back your system cannot digest and you are saved by Excel. <br>  ‚ÄúWe need to write a service for working with a vendor‚Äù - the next goal sounds.  For the sake of interest, it turns out that the data already come through the <b>Indo-excel-manager's</b> path. <br>  Yes, do not forget that this is real money.  Which are deducted from your current account, at the time of formation in the depths of a certain system of documents on movement.  Of course, the stability and correctness of which is damaged by all the developers who created it. <br><br>  <b>Winter 2009</b> <br>  You, as a developer, complete the cycle of moving parts from the vendor to the central office, from the central office to the service centers and back to the vendor as a marriage.  Prior to this, all the details came to you, remained in the service centers, were utilized and all this data is there.  In Excel of course. <br><br>  <b>Winter 2010</b> <br>  The service for working with the vendor through SOAP is made, it works, the data comes in, one ‚Äú <b>but</b> ‚Äù if the Internet has fallen, then the data from the other side will still go, no one knows where, but they will go.  But you can always find out what should have been received in 3-5 days using the already established <b>Indo-excel-manager</b> access. <br><br>  <b>Spring 2010</b> <br>  Accounting has become interesting, as it is - the details that used to go along the same scheme, now go around the other and ..., in theory and in secret, you can see the entire history of the movement of any of them.  Who received how much and must return.  This interest grows to such an extent that it would be nice to create invoices, and other documentation to send the details. <br><br>  <b>Summer 2010</b> <br>  You have created invoices.  Now the logistician can print out a set of documentation after collecting the box.  But only the warehouse manager can sign them. <br>  A strategic decision is taken to change the process of forming supplies to service centers. <br><br>  <b>Fall 2010</b> <br>  After a long manual analysis of the debts of service centers, it was decided to discontinue deliveries to service centers of paid spare parts without prepayment, but dispatches with warranty spare parts should be drawn up according to the old scheme.  There is something to think about. <br><br>  <b>Winter 2010</b> <br>  It creates a functional analysis of debt service centers in front of the central office.  After that, several managers deal with the debts of half a year - a year ago.  Begins a long and painstaking work on their return. <br><br>  <b>Winter 2011</b> <br>  You are preparing for the transition to the multivendron system. <br><br>  So, the ERP system can be created in 2 years by a small group of developers.  Even in the absence of a network administrator (database), continuous support of legacy systems.  Regular shortage of free space on the media.  Parallel development of related development: <br><ul><li>  Warehouse inventory </li><li>  Functionality for the analysis of equipment for parts (the project was closed) </li><li>  Issuance of purchase orders to engineers of the repair site </li></ul><br><br>  Of course, its capabilities will be very modest.  She will not be certified, but she will work as the company lives.  She will repeat her strange path. <br><br>  So, the next time you go to a company, you will see "something", perhaps it will be the best solution. <br><br>  P.S.  If it is interesting, this topic can be continued by examining the implementation of the system core, the walk to data storage, the formation of a turnover document (creation, accounting, modification) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131203/</a></p>
