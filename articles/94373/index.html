      <b>UPD dated May 26, 2010</b> : <br>  I stumbled upon an interesting study by Levada Center on the issue of bribes.  It turns out not so simple.  Here is the text: <br><br>  <b><a href="http://slon.ru/news/384771/%3Fsphrase_id%3D51588">More than half of the citizens of the Russian Federation can not without bribes</a></b> <br>  MOSCOW (Reuters) - Over half of the residents of the Russian Federation are convinced that anyone who encounters officials in Russia has to pay bribes, a survey by the Levada Center showed. <br><br>  Over 10 years, the number of adherents of such an opinion increased to 55 percent from 51 percent in 2000, the Levada Center said. <br><br>  Only 10 percent of survey participants believe that officials are corrupted by ‚Äúswindlers and criminals,‚Äù while 30 percent of respondents believe that ‚Äúbribes are given mostly by ordinary people who do not have other ways to solve their problems.‚Äù  Similarly, 29 percent of the participants in the previous survey in 2000 considered.  Then the blame for corruption on the "crooks and criminals" laid 13 percent of respondents. <br><br>  A survey by the Levada Center showed that 47 percent of applicants give money to officials in envelopes "reluctantly," and 33 percent described the emotions experienced as "tremendous resistance."  And only 11 percent give bribes "with a light heart." <br><br>  Respondents admitted that over the past three years, they personally or their relatives often had to bribe officials when registering firms, and also ‚Äúcajole‚Äù traffic police officers in exchange for ‚Äúforgiveness‚Äù for breaking traffic rules, issuing driving licenses or registering a car and issuing vehicle inspection . <br><br>  Third place in the ‚Äúrating‚Äù of corruption from Levada Center is for the courts, whose employees, judging by the results of the survey, do not disdain bribes, especially when it comes to criminal proceedings. <br><br>  The survey showed that Russians also often have to bribe medical staff - for the sake of normal care in hospitals, employers - in order to get the desired position, as well as local authorities, so that they give out the necessary certificates and documents and get housing rights. <br><br>  Judging by the results of the survey, not only the life of Russians does not go without corruption, but their retreat into the world is different: about 10 percent of Levada Center respondents admitted that they paid bribes when organizing the funeral of their loved ones. <br><br>  According to a poll in 2009, international public organization Transparency International placed Russia in 146th place out of 180 in terms of the degree of corruption in the public sector, next to Cameroon and Zimbabwe. <br><br>  (Vlasta Demyanenko, editor Dmitry Antonov) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94373/</a></p>
