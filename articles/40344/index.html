During this time I managed to work with many employers and get a certain experience of communication with them, which I want to share. <br><br>  <i>This article is addressed primarily to novice managers working with remote employees, in particular with designers (I myself am a designer and will talk about the pros and cons of working from my point of view).</i>  <i>Here I will describe some of the problems in the interaction of a freelance customer who interferes with fruitful work (I personally, I dare to assume that most of the performers, too).</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Go‚Ä¶

      <br>
      The main reason for the low productivity of a remote employee is low motivation, it is not a secret to anyone, and often monetary compensation alone is not enough to increase it.  The quality of the performer depends on many factors: <br><br>  <b>Adequate criticism.</b> <br><br>  This is the most important, and most often forgotten.  When giving you the result of the work, it is not necessary to evaluate it as a finished, ready-to-use product.  When working on a project, the performer will first carry it out as he himself sees fit, even if there is a hard TK, of course this may not suit the employer, and later your amendments may be misunderstood.  If you are interested in obtaining the desired result, then point out specifically the shortcomings in the work, trying to avoid expressions like ‚ÄúI do not understand what it is,‚Äù ‚Äúit does not correspond to the TK‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like everything.‚Äù  One employer each time, taking a job from me, commented on it: ‚ÄúGreat.  I'll send corrections now. ‚Äù  Very nice to work with. <br><br>  <b>Punctuality.</b> <br><br>  A great discovery, but very often they forget about it.  Try to name the exact dates of each stage of work, for example, ‚ÄúI will send amendments at 6 pm‚Äù and, accordingly, try to do everything on time.  If you do not have time to date, this must be reported to the performer.  It is extremely important for the employee to know that he is remembered and that the work he performs is important.  Nothing knocks out the work rhythm like a deadline by an employer. <br><br>  <b>The trust.</b> <br><br>  If you do not have enough experience in the subject of work, then this must be reported to the performer, and trust in his experience.  Responsibility for the work performed will increase significantly. <br><br>  <b>Technical security.</b> <br><br>  Do not trust the development of the mail, the mail exists for correspondence, and for the storage of working documents there are <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVN">subversation</a> and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP">ftopeshniki</a> .  Your knowledge of this question will make it clear that the performer is working with a professional. <br><br>  <b>Do not press on terms.</b> <br><br>  Do not be interested every day in the progress of the work (if there is no agreement on the opposite), if there is still a week left before the agreed deadline for the work  In the case when the development has been delayed, this also does not need to be constantly reminded, this will not speed up the work.  If you want to accelerate, it is necessary to agree on this with the employee. <br><br>  <b>Weekend - my rightful rest.</b> <br><br>  This is holy.  You do not need to get the artist in ICQ (otherwise he will hide in the inviz), do not be late to send corrections to the mail (read and forget) and in no case call the phone.  If you want the employee to work on weekends, encourage him additionally, here the money plays a significant role. <br><br>  <b>Openness and friendliness.</b> <br><br>  Also not news.  At the beginning of the working day - to greet, at the end - to say goodbye, before the weekend to wish a good rest.  Simple rules, nothing complicated, but a personal attitude to you will increase. <br><br>  <b>Timely payment.</b> <br><br>  It follows from the rule of punctuality, but with a small addition.  If you work on a long-term basis, with piecework wages, then you should first be interested in whether there are any unpaid work, without waiting for a reminder.  The fact that the freelancer is not only waiting for results, but also taking care of the payment will have a favorable effect on motivation. <br><br>  <b>Do not promise gold mines.</b> <br><br>  There is a misconception that the promise "if we work together, there will be more projects" is good.  Nirazu is not good.  There is only one project on which the freelancer works, what will be after him, he is not interested in much.  You do not need ‚Äúa lot of interesting tasks‚Äù in the ghostly future, give only one, but now.  You do not work with a machine tool that stamps one type of product, but with a developing and growing specialist, if the freelancer agreed to do the work, it does not at all mean that he is interested in 10 more. <br><br>  <b>Be able to say goodbye.</b> <br><br>  If for some reason the work did not work out, part as kindly as possible.  This is not only a sign of civilization, it has a practical meaning.  As I wrote above, a freelancer is constantly growing, and in the near future he can reach a sufficient level to fulfill your tasks, or you will find a task according to his powers.  Check out the freelancer portfolio and keep in touch. <br><br>  I hope my experience will be useful for you) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40344/</a></p>
