  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The software helped to complete the Gaudi plan, which started 130 years ago.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Construction of the Sagrada Familia began in 1882, and later this year the construction was headed by the famous architect Antonio Gaudi, who laid the foundations of the now world-famous church of Barcelona.  Gaudi dedicated the Sagrada Familia many years and 130 years later, the temple is considered one of the most amazing and unique buildings on Earth.  Although over the past time, construction has not been completed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/686/f38/a7f/686f38a7f81b27ce7004b0fe80cfa5d7.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  CBS News turned to the Temple of the Holy Family in its <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/%3Fid%3D50142539n">60 Minutes program</a> , released on Saturday, delving into the history and mythology of Gaudi‚Äôs unfinished masterpiece.  The history of the church and almost religious devotion to the heritage of Gaudi now allow construction to continue.  Gaudi set out in detail his vision and plans for Sagrada Familia in a set of models that he built shortly before his death in 1926, but these models were destroyed 10 years later by the military, who fired on the building during the Spanish civil war.  This made it difficult for the architect‚Äôs followers to understand how to continue building, but modern technology has breathed new life into their efforts.

      Using the latest aerospace software, Mark Barry and other architects were able to carry out reverse-engineering of Gaudi models based on the surviving remnants.  Now Barry, with a group of architects, heads the construction of the main tower of the temple, which upon completion will rise 566 feet (173 meters) above the ground, making Sagrada Familia the tallest church on the planet. <br><br>  But the fact that the architects had to use the software of the 21st century to complete the architectural masterpiece of Gaudi, begun in the 19th century, speaks of its outstanding architectural language. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe had to turn to other professionals who could help us cope with the complexity of the Temple,‚Äù says Barry in the broadcast.  The only equivalent is the efforts that are being made today by the designers of cars, airplanes and ships.  "They have been struggling for decades with the same problems that Gaudi solved in architecture." <br><br>  He also talks about Gaudi's exciting ambitions.  According to the biographer of the architect, Gaudi conceived the Sagrada Familia as an encapsulation of the entire Catholic history - as a ‚ÄúBible in stone‚Äù, which combines Gothic traditions and modern feelings.  "He is the one who reinvented the language of architecture." <br><br>  <b>From the translator</b> : Probably in this news the technical side of the reconstruction of the Sagrada Familia is not very well covered, but I think for everyone who was in Barcelona this temple is more than just stones placed on top of each other.  I hope that its construction, which continues with the help of modern software, will interest you a little bit. <br><br>  CBS: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/%3Fid%3D50142539n">Video</a> + <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/%3Fid%3D50142547n">Video</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172397/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172397/</a></p>
