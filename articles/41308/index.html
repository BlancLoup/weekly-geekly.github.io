Our team also submitted its project to the jury. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5f/2de/e23/d5f2dee23f2c37c575b55ba4bb85b491.jpg" alt="image"><img src="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/images/netbeans_193x45.gif" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Read about how one team attempted a big score <br><br><h5>  Intro </h5><br>  The goal of the competition is to make some NetBeans-based stray from April to August. <br>  Who makes the development of the world RIA, he knows that Sun was born another handicraft - JavaFX.  After studying in detail the first preview release of this language, I realized that Sun specifically decided to move Adobe with its Flash and MS with its ‚Äúsilver light‚Äù.  Undoubtedly, the new scripting language is very convenient for creating animation, non-standard user interfaces.  Unfortunately, a preview release was released in the summer, and applications for the competition were submitted in the spring. <br><br><h5>  The project workshop "crazy hands" </h5><br>  We decided to make a ‚Äúflash killer‚Äù <i>(a lot of irony and humor)</i> .  Java has a rich API for creating both 2D graphics and animation, in addition there is an API for working with 3D graphics.  Unfortunately, this API is so confused that it is very inconvenient to use it - you need to write too much code.  JavaFX offers cool Java graphic chips, but do not crack the code in such incredible quantities.  But our project offered to refuse from programming altogether - the user opens a program (based on NB) and starts doing animation, such as in Adobe Flash or AfterEffects.  We made our own pro-node and sent it to the organizers.  In general, the idea was 100% complete - we are promoting JavaFX, the latest offspring of Sun, with our project, moving both the NB platform and Java + JavaFX into non-programmer masses ‚Äî user interface designers, multipliers, animators, for whom in general and designed JavaFX.  Nevertheless, as practical guys, we mentioned in our application that JavaFX Script is still raw and laid in the timeplan (it was necessary to provide a brief plan for the project with intermediate releases / iterations) recursive work: which is better - still to rely on clean Java2D and Swing, or on their wrapper - JavaFX Script?  It is extremely silly to dance from the stove, which is not yet fully folded.  We have kept our fork, if in a week we realize that JavaFX is unreliable, then we do everything on pure Java2D and Swing.

    <h5>  Brutal bummer </h5><br>  In early April, the finalists were announced - we are among them.  Then it was discovered that an error had occurred, a similar project had passed, but its author was some kind of Hindu.  I started a monstrous butt: well, no mistake for yourself!  It turned out that the Indian project had bypassed us barely (and we even had the same name), because he had a more detailed plan (nonsense! What a detailed plan here, these are fairy tales), and he wrote that he would do everything in JavaFX ( brave indian guy).  As I said then, he would not do anything, and that‚Äôs what happened. <br>  He did not pass the project, did not receive the grant. <br><br><h5>  'And the winner is ...' </h5><br>  In the fall, winners were announced (those whose projects were not only approved by the jury, but also brought to the end).  In my opinion, the most delusional is <a href="https://monoh.dev.java.net/">monoh</a> , which turns the IDE into some kind of crap with voice dialing, like a phone.  It is a pity, the author did not dare to program the prog, which progat other programs.  That would be a number - wrote a program, leaned back in a chair, and she for you the code, compiles it, and then the test itself.  That would be the beginning of life for simple hard-working programmers.  Of course, the <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/Scala">project with the support of Scala</a> collected all the main prizes and prizes.  In addition to the Rock, a bug tracker based on NB was especially noted. <br>  Honestly, it seems to me that those projects have been rewarded with despair - well, it‚Äôs not worth the eye to catch on.  NetBeans' Scala support is cool, but it doesn‚Äôt smell like innovation - now everyone feels comfortable with IDE for ‚Äúmulti-language‚Äù.  A large grant received the project ‚Äúa la MS Project‚Äù on NetBinze.  But this is a stillborn child.  Who needs it ...?  Who needs another bug tracker, if there is a Jira, and besides Jira there are some more equally popular bug trackers that open easily in the browser, you don‚Äôt need to install anything anywhere. <br><br><h5>  PS </h5><br>  I must say that many companies hold similar contests designed to collect more or less adequate ideas and ready-made prototypes for relatively little money.  In my opinion, the money for the NB Innovators grant was wasted.  There is no innovation here. <br>  <b>I would be very happy if we in Habr√© started a corresponding blog dedicated to participating in contests, discussing mistakes, failures and successes of the contestants.</b>  <b>There you could also put links to the ongoing contests, as well as (which looks completely unrealistic) to link up with the tims and try to cut the money from sponsors for their ideas and crafts.</b> <br>  If the head is, she needs to work! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41308/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41308/</a></p>
