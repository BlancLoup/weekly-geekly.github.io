  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On-line business in RuNet.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Have you ever tried to search the Internet for information on earnings in the network?  I'm sure you did it and maybe not even once!  From my personal experience, I know how the thoughts of freedom and independence stupefy me.  I firmly believe that a person should strive to arrange his life in the best way for him.  And making money on the Internet is no worse than making money in reality!  It is necessary to censure theft and fraud, and attempts to earn honestly deserve only praise. <br>  I read a bunch of articles on how to build your online business.  And you know what conclusion you came to?  Those people who successfully earn on the network are engaged in what they say about how to successfully earn on the network, naturally doing it not for free. <br><br>  Somehow it becomes sour from such a conclusion.  And I want to find evidence that there is still a business online!  And this business is built on normal commodity-money relations (in the morning money is in the evening chairs).  And lo and behold!  It turns out there are many online stores that just work on the principle of pay and you will be happy.  Can this type of business be considered online?  From the position that the action takes place in the network, and the buyer does not leave his favorite chair - this is a hundred percent online business.  But the audience is still rather weak, well, the Russian doesn‚Äôt like to buy online.  Does not like or can not. <br><br>  Not all people want to have a business, some just want to have more or less stable income and work at home.  Implementing in practice the principle of "How to sink, and burst."  It turns out that you can also make money on such people, for this you just need to create an online labor exchange!  Such projects in RuNet, also like mushrooms after rain!  We register and work until blue or green, as you like!

      Well, finally advertising!  What is that, and advertising everywhere will make a way for itself!  To her, what is real, that the virtual business is all one!  Want to be successful online?  Pay!  And for what to pay zavsegda there. <br><br>  At worst, we counted three of the most popular ways to build your business online; now, in fact, the question arises, which of them can you and I do?  Advertising?  Brrrr ... God forbid!  Not for that five years they gnawed on granite of technical sciences, so now they shouldn't go anywhere.  Build another job exchange?  Or another online store?  Hmmm ... I don't think this is a good idea!  As I said, the Russian people do not understand the benefits of electronic shopping! <br><br>  As a result, many, realizing the hopelessness of the situation, stop listening to those who broadcast a successful online business, are served as freelancers and thus earn their bread with thought.  In their place come others who readily give their hard-earned money for the dream!  Well, I am still tormented by the question: ‚ÄúWhat is he?
