  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to spoil a useful service (for example, Yandex.Maps)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yandex has a great product - Yandex.Maps.  The value of this tool is probably difficult to overestimate: many of us use Maps every day. <br><br>  What makes this product really interesting is user-generated information.  First of all, of course, information about the speed of movement, which is converted into a map of traffic jams.  As well as text user information when people warn others about road closures, congestion and all sorts of dangers. <br><br>  But without a skillful moderation, any product in which end users participate can seriously deteriorate.  Now, using the example of Yandex.Maps, I will show how this happens. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  No, it's not about the mat in the "Talkers".  Without him, not even so fun.  Now the conversation will focus on a situation where, apparently, with the best of intentions, they do worse.  In principle, much is already clear from the first picture:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7c/d21/c25/f7cd21c2541ca6c2eb619d39dad61ead.jpg"><br><br>  This is the M4 highway.  Probably the best track in Russia.  Indeed, the world level: you can put the car on cruise control right after the MKAD and take about 4 hours to get to Voronezh without extra voltage.  The road is made by all standards.  In particular, pedestrian crossings are visible from afar.  Signs are everywhere, they are made with a reflective coating. <br><br>  So what's the problem?  The problem is that some organization (in this case, Avtodor) takes a tool to notify others about unforeseen interrogations (an ‚Äúexclamation mark‚Äù) and uses it in such a way that it ceases to be a meaningful means of information.  Just like in the ancient parable about the boy and the wolves.  If you warn - be aware of the responsibility for your words.  Otherwise, for the 25th time they stop listening to you. <br><br>  Most likely, someone's cast-iron head, in fulfillment of the Highest commandment to reduce mortality on the roads, thought of bringing measures to reduce, and so on, and so on ... It turned out wildly.  A driver who wants to know if there is anything unforeseen ahead - accidents, traffic jams, floors - has to read many, many times that there will be a crosswalk ahead.  What for??  On the ground, I repeat, crossings are already clearly visible, the road is built according to all the rules. <br><br>  Here is another example.  Moscow: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/476/598/39d/47659839df3b3202191519380d384144.jpg"><br><br>  Such foolishness toil for quite some time.  ‚ÄúHazardous area‚Äù, immediately 4 warnings, stuck almost at the same place.  What constructive information is given by these warnings, which literally stuck the whole Ring Road on Yandex.Maps?  What should the driver do?  Memento mori? <br><br>  The modern driver is already muzzled by any annoying information: the density of the traffic flow itself, advertising, camera warnings, countless interchanges.  And now, when he wants to check the map, he now also has annoying annotations around him that do not carry any practical meaning.  In short, sheer neuroticism.  Will an unnerved driver behave more adequately on the road? .. <br><br>  And here is some other harm from such an approach.  For example, this is a really useful warning: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ccd/d32/ffa/ccdd32ffa1bf931873c7a395498af6af.jpg"><br><br>  It can be ignored by other road users, because everyone is accustomed to hiding spam from the Data Center for the exclamation mark on the map. <br><br>  In short, information transmitted within a single social network, the activity in which is aimed at solving specific problems (for example, like Yandex.Maps - cartographic information, accompanied by participants in the movement about the features on the terrain), should have a completely formatted, understandable form.  So the loss on decoding information will be reduced to a minimum level.  And even more so when a person is driving, the time for which he is distracted from management in order to obtain this information from Yandex.Map should strive to a minimum. <br><br>  An example of a brief and as clear as possible message: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edd/b4e/dd6/eddb4edd613343053f9fad222644a50f.jpg"><br><br>  There is nothing to think here: I saw the ‚Äúoverlap‚Äù sign and a section of the road out of the corner of my eye, everything is instantly clear.  Even duplication of pictograms may not cause harm, but on the contrary, inform the driver of the length of the section being repaired: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f5/9b5/b09/1f59b5b09b140fc88dc59ba754c75573.jpg"><br><br>  Here, too, everything is clear: the answer to the question "what happened and why the jam" is read by the user instantly <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a9/2c2/bf7/9a92c2bf71315df383b59cb918ff0757.jpg"><br><br>  But the exclamation point tool is far from being so effective when we want to warn other drivers about something really important.  Thank you Pinocchio from large organizations. <br><br><hr><br>  This moment sooner or later (rather sooner) comes in the life of any social network (in a broad sense: where many people interact with each other).  What is initially designed as a tool for interacting with others on top of the usual (it can be caps-lock, highlighting text, banners calling for help to the child, etc., etc.) easily deteriorates when one of agents for the sake of solving immediate problems begins to use it to attract maximum attention.  As a result, the entire ecosystem of the network suffers: its agents cease to respond properly to such stimuli provided by the design, or the speed of perception of significant information decreases noticeably. <br><br>  In a more or less wide community there will always be groups of people who will act against the long-term interests of the community, pursuing their own personal goals. <br><br>  And it is a pity that Yandex allows this process to flow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354606/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354606/</a></p>
