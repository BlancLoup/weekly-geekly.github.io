Do everything to ensure that information published on the site can be easily verified.</b> <br><br>  This can be achieved by publishing sources of materials.  Even if people do not check the links, they will see that the information is supported by something. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>2. Show that the site is a real organization.</b> <br><br>  The credibility of the site will increase greatly when people see that there is a real organization behind it.  The easiest way to achieve this is to publish the address of the company.  Other methods (the publication of photos of office, registration data of firm) will only help. <br><br>  <b>3. Emphasize your expertise and competence in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe services offered so that it can be seen in the published texts.</b> <br><br>  Do you have experts?  You work with the state.  organizations?  Do not hide this information.  Do you work with a reputable company?  Give visitors the opportunity to learn about it.  Conversely, do not link to sites with low confidence.  Your association website will also lose confidence from visitors. <br><br>  <b>4. Show that there are honest and trustworthy people behind the site.</b> <br><br>  The first part of the advice is to show that there are real people behind the site.  At the next stage, it is necessary to inspire trust in these people through images and texts.  For example, some sites publish biographies of workers to tell about their hobbies and families. <br><br>  <b>5. Simplify contact with you.</b> <br><br>  A simple way to increase the credibility of the site - it is clear and understandable to publish contact information: phone, address and email. <br><br>  <b>6. Order a professional design.</b> <br><br>  We concluded that people quickly evaluate the site for its design.  When designing, pay attention to typography, images, element layouts, etc.  Of course, not all sites will gain confidence in what will look like IBM.com.  Visual design should be combined with the objectives of the site. <br><br>  <b>7. Make your site useful and simple.</b> <br><br>  We decided to combine the two councils into one.  Our research has shown that websites gain the trust of visitors with their simplicity and utility.  Some developers in the process of creating the site forget about the users, praising the company and showing all their ability to work with web technologies. <br><br>  <b>8. Update content more often (or at least let us understand that its relevance is regularly checked).</b> <br><br>  People believe more in sites that show that they have recently been updated. <br><br>  <b>9. Be discreet with any propaganda and promotional materials (for example, various offers, advertising, etc.)</b> <br><br>  If possible, remove all ads from the site altogether.  If advertising can not be avoided, then clearly separate it from the main content.  Forget about pop-ups if you do not plan to irritate visitors and lose their trust for good.  As for the writing style, be straightforward, clear and sincere. <br><br>  <b>10. Try to avoid mistakes, despite their small size.</b> <br><br>  Typographical errors and broken links negatively affect the trust to the site more than the project owners can assume.  It is also very important to pay attention to the availability and continuity of work. <br><br>  PS from me: if someone is interested in the topic seriously, following the link indicated at the very beginning of the article, you can find a bibliography of the material (both books and electronic documents in PDF format), which was used in the preparation of the study. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3196/</a></p>
