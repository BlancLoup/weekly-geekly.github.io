      A modern child receives from parents his personal first phone, tablet, watch-phone at a rather early age, from 5-6 years old.  For what?  That the parent could always contact his child.  And as a rule, and this is natural, the model, and at the same time the technical capabilities remain behind the choice of the parent.  The parent pays for the device itself, its maintenance and in case of problems (technical, software), he himself is engaged in their elimination. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this uncomplicated manner, we have just considered an interesting and increasingly popular concept in organizations, the so-called <b>CYOD</b> concept <b>(Choose Your Own Device)</b> , which literally means ‚Äúchoose your device‚Äù.  In this case, the organization, at its discretion, offers its employee a certain choice of devices, while the company itself purchases and pays for services, as well as technical services.  At the same time, the choice of the model and software remains with the company and, above all, due to the financial component, as well as the capabilities of the company's technical staff who will service this device. <br><br>  Meanwhile, our baby is growing up and even well versed in all the capabilities of your phone.  And maybe even not bad versed in its settings.  But still, not in a position to purchase a device for themselves.  For example, due to financial insolvency. <br><br>  So in our article there is another concept, the concept of <b>COPE (Corporate-Owned Personally Enabled)</b> , which literally means "corporate devices, the setting and maintenance of which the employee is engaged in independently."  As in the previous case, the company acquires an employee a phone, tablet or laptop, but in this concept, the employee is independently responsible for setting it up and maintaining it, at least to a certain extent. <br><br>  Time is relentless and our baby is not a child at all, he has some savings and no permanent income, even if it is pocket money.  He already has a certain baggage of technical knowledge and he already has his own opinion on the choice of the device and it is no longer so important that this, phone, tablet or laptop, with the current level of technology, the boundaries of these concepts are blurred.  He gets for himself the model of the device that he likes and can afford, with the technical characteristics that he needs.  He pays (out of pocket) the installed application, and even pays for the connection himself, ideally.  What remains unchanged?  That's right, mom still needs to know how to contact her child, even if it is a new device.  And if we consider this life situation in the prism of the organization.  If we make our mother the head of this company, we‚Äôll reveal the latest and most advanced concept to date - BYOD. <br><br>  <b>BYOD (Bring Your Own Device),</b> which literally means "bring your device."  And the meaning of this concept is very simple.  Bring your mobile device and be always in touch and at work.  For the first time this term appeared in 2005, with the release of the work of Rafael Ballagas ‚ÄúBYOD: Bring Your Own Device‚Äù, but has gained particular popularity recently.  As it is not difficult to guess, an employee in the company from his personal smartphone-tablet-laptop while in the company or not, has the opportunity to work. <br><br>  Any concept presented has a number of undeniable advantages, but it also has a number of drawbacks and sometimes insurmountable difficulties.  It is impossible to dispute that an employee of a company is always in touch with events, but at the same time, where is this border within the framework of the labor code regarding this ‚Äúalways‚Äù?  And, of course, at the head of the corner, the safety and confidentiality of company information, devices can and are subject to attacks, but they can be elementary somewhere abandoned or forgotten.  In this case, it is a big human risk. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442890/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442890/</a></p>
