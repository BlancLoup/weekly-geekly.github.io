  <section class="page js-page"><h1>.masterhost: some history and future plans</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Masterkhost will celebrate its 15th anniversary next year.</b>  <b>A solid age for a Russian company operating in the field of Internet industry.</b>  <b>Such a respectable age willy-nilly makes you look back and think about what happened during that time, what results have been achieved.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Dmitry Krikov, development director of the company Masterhost, a person working in the company almost from the day of its foundation, will tell about what was, what is and what will be in the company Masterhost.</b> <br><br>  <b>Dima, some time ago it was announced that Masterhost and REG.RU were merged.</b>  <b>What is this story and how did it all end?</b> <br>  First, let's remember how it all began.  In the summer of 2011, REG.RU domain name registrar and Masterhost hosting market leader announced a planned merger of companies, which was announced at a press conference on the topic: ‚ÄúDomain market and hosting in Russia: new leaders and new perspectives‚Äù. <br>  But the press conference is one thing, but life has judged in its own way.  For a number of reasons, the merger did not take place, each company decided to develop its business independently.  This was also written in a number of media. <br>  <b>Masterhost has always been one of the leaders in the hosting market.</b>  <b>And how are things today?</b> <br>  Nothing, in fact, has changed.  Masterhost and now retains its leading position in the market and is doing everything possible to keep this leadership. <br>  We have expanded and continue to expand our range of services and facilities.  Constantly in the process of updating the technical base.  Recently, our specialists have solved many tasks to improve the stability and performance of services. <br>  In recent years, we have introduced a number of new systems and technologies, and the scale of a number of projects is the largest not only in Russia, but also in Europe.  For example, Masterhost, according to independent experts, is the absolute leader in Europe in the number of IPv6-served domains.  So, ‚Äúleadership in everything‚Äù for Masterhost is not just beautiful words, but a business philosophy. <br>  <b>What plans do you have for the future?</b> <br>  One of the projects that we can safely talk about is the construction of a new Data Center corresponding to the TIER III level according to the Uptime Institute classification.  Since  In 2012, many of our customers suffered due to a power failure, while designing a new DC we tried to take into account all reasonably possible force majeure: the project provides for the reservation of all key infrastructure elements and compliance with the availability ratio of over 99.98%. <br>  Of course, this is not the only project.  A large-scale work is underway to introduce new services.  Among them are unique services that no one else on the Russian market provides. <br>  <b>And detail?</b> <br>  I do not want to talk in advance.  Of course, we are not superstitious, but ... We‚Äôll do everything, test it, then you are welcome.  And we will show, and we will tell, and we will write necessarily. <br><a name="habracut"></a></div>
