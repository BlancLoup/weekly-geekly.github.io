      <strong>What is the reason for the obligation to fill in the fields ‚ÄúFull name‚Äù when registering on the site?</strong> <br><br>  - In fact, this is just an additional opportunity that allows people, communicating on the site, to contact each other by name.  In this case, no one requires a person to specify his name and surname.  Many registered users simply specify any nicknames.  For example, we have a user named Sarancha Ivanovna.  Well and good.  Specifying your first and last name or not is a user's right. <br><br>  On the other hand, if a person indicated his name and surname during registration, he, in our opinion, would react to what he writes and does on the site, more responsibly.  For our project, the degree of responsibility of its users is important. <br><br>  <strong>- Do you plan to somehow solve the issue of mail delivery guarantees - to a greater extent than is being implemented now?</strong>  <strong>Do you have plans, for example, to cooperate with any insurance company?</strong> <br><br>  - Of course, the question of guarantees is very important.  Pay attention, for example, to such sites as Molotok.ru, or Free-lance.ru.  On these resources, guarantees are built on the feedback system.  After completion of the transaction, counterparties leave feedback to each other.  The number of reviews and user rating show the security level of the transaction with him.  At the same time, users transfer a lot of money to each other for, say, work that has not yet been completed or goods that have not been received, focusing only on reputation.  These resources are successfully developing, and we can say that such a guarantee system has proven itself well and works not only in RuNet, but throughout the world. <br><br>  As for our security system, it, firstly, provides for exactly the same review system based on the gradual formation of reputation.  Well and, besides, and most importantly, people, passing the parcels, meet in person.  In this case, the sender can always ask to present documents from the person delivering the parcel, and find out his mobile phone number. <br><br>  Thus, at present, our guarantee system is even stronger than on other resources based on user interaction.  As for cooperation with insurance companies, of course, we plan to do this.  In the future, I think every sender will be able to insure his package online on our resource. <br><br>  <strong>- What about the contents of the package?</strong>  <strong>If a customer transfers cocaine or a weapon in a bag with clothes, does the ‚Äúsite bear no responsibility‚Äù or will you still somehow try to help identify such customers?</strong> <br><br>  - So far we have not recorded such cases (and I hope it will not be).  In the fight against the possibility of such cases, first of all, the same review system will help.  Secondly, the person delivering the parcel, of course, always has the right to know what he delivers, and I think that if he has any doubts about this, he can ask the sender to dispel them.  If such cases do occur, we will take steps to compile a blacklist of unscrupulous senders in order to protect those delivering the parcels from any problems. <br><br>  <strong>- Some Birdymail users agree with each other about mail transfer fees.</strong>  <strong>Why not make it easier for them and enter the appropriate fields on the site?</strong> <br><br>  - I think that in the near future we will do it.  However, I would like to say that the service was conceived simply as a place where some good people help others with delivery.  The remuneration was not at the forefront - therefore, such a field has not been entered so far.  Well, the absence of this field does not prevent people from reporting that the delivery will not be free of charge. <br><br>  <strong>- It is no secret that such services were implemented before the advent of Birdymail - in particular, on the project porucheno.ru.</strong>  <strong>What are your advantageous differences and advantages?</strong> <br><br>  - We believe that the question is not quite correct.  The fact is that such services were not implemented before the advent of Birdymail, currently our resource is unique. <br>  If to compare with porucheno.ru, then: <br><br>  Birdymail: <br>  1) this is a web2.0 site where users meet, communicate, form content; <br>  2) we have everything for free; <br>  3) our website allows you to deliver the parcel at the destination. <br><br>  Porucheno.ru: <br>  1) not a web2.0 site, users communicate only with the site administration, and not among themselves; <br>  2) the administration provides only paid services; <br>  3) with the help of porucheno.ru you can not send a parcel to the destination. <br><br>  In fact, there is not a single similar feature of our project with porucheno.ru, which is, in fact, a corporate site on which you can order a service (by the way, you can do this not on the site, but by phone).  They have representatives in different cities that perform this service.  But they will not deliver the parcel.  At best, they will simply go to the post office and send it (or send it by courier Birdymail).  Therefore, such a statement of the question is not entirely correct, since it unreasonably casts doubt on our primacy in the field of ‚Äúdelivery 2.0‚Äù. <br><br>  At present, we do not know of any such service in Runet, and indeed in the whole world.  Apart from, of course, various forums or communities, like "Riga-Moscow" or "Moscow-Peter", where users from time to time write announcements about events in the relevant direction.  On the other hand, if we do not know about such services, this does not mean that they do not exist.  Ideas are in the air. <br><br>  <strong>- What do you think, if you ‚Äúintegrate‚Äù the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãBirdymail into the framework of any of the popular social networks with several million participants throughout the country, will it be quite effective?</strong> <br><br>  - In my opinion, the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãBirdymail is easily embedded in any social network with good attendance.  Of course, this will be effective - after all, attendance for sites like ours is of key importance.  After overcoming a certain quantitative level of users, the resource acquires a new quality.  We already have many registered users, but so far we have not yet risen to a new quality level.  And therefore my heart bleeds when I see an announcement on our website that, for example, it is necessary to urgently transport a sick cat from Moscow to Kazakhstan, and there are no people heading there.  But it‚Äôs just a matter of time - every day more and more people learn about our site. <br><br>  <strong>- Do you have any plans to promote and promote your project?</strong>  <strong>Will you place someone else's advertising?</strong> <br><br>  - Of course, we have already taken up the promotion.  Currently, first of all, we focus on urban Internet portals.  Including those cities that are far from the central part of the country - because from there the parcels go much longer, and send them more expensive.  As for placing someone else's advertising, we do not plan to do this.  This will cause extra inconvenience to users.  In the funds for the promotion of the site, we currently do not need. <br>  <strong>- Do you plan to monetize the project in the future - for example, at the expense of the commission transferred by the customer to the service?</strong> <br><br>  - Not.  Our site is completely non-commercial, and we like it very much.  We are just glad that we can bring benefit to people and are not going to take money from anyone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23875/</a></p>
