The concept of "deep".</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The beginning of this article was put here <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/ui_design_and_usability/41824.html">habrahabr.ru/blog/ui_design_and_usability/41824.html</a> .  There I described the situation, the problem and the formulation of the problem.  In this article, I propose my solution. <br><br>  In my first article, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ganzer/" class="user_link">ganzer</a> expressed a thought similar to the one that occurred to me: "I propose to place the entire site and services on one page."  Yes it is!  There is something in it.  Another <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/366/" class="user_link">366</a> user gave a link to the Webby Awards Navigation &amp; Structure nomination.  I looked at them and realized that they are no different in simplicity and affordability.  These are excellent examples of technical thought, the skill of programmers and designers.  This is almost an art, but I find that, like any art in everyday work, such techniques are simply redundant, unusual, unusual and even repulsive.  In my first article, I described the target user as ‚Äúan ordinary, average person without any technical training.‚Äù  The user who is guided by my resource, sometimes even you with the web and computer, may well be intimidated by all the innovative performance that is present, for example, on <a href="http://www.schematic.com/">www.schematic.com</a> or on the winner of <a href="http://www.ted.com/">www.ted.com</a> . <br><br>  I also want to mention the nominee <a href="http://www.blenderbox.com/">www.blenderbox.com</a> .  In the ideas of navigating this site there is what I would like to see in my decision: the context formed by users.  As you can see, my concept is somewhat similar to the decision of the site <a href="http://www.blenderbox.com/">www.blenderbox.com</a> .

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, a few introductory words about the main task at hand - navigation and, as the main reason for navigation, searching for information.  Personally, I search for information on the site was like fishing, such a goldfish.  The goldfish in this case, obviously, is the final URL on which the user will find the information of interest.  In this case, the site is a kind of pond in which a large number of fish is found and only one or a few are golden, that is, necessary.  As in the pond, the site has a concept of depth, as in the pond, the deeper the goldfish, the more action is needed to catch it.  Such is the simple concept. <br><br>  I submit to your court my implementation of a pond with goldfish: the concept of ‚Äúdeep‚Äù, which is located at <a href="http://www.bankinform.ru/deep/">www.bankinform.ru/deep</a> (do not consider it an advertisement, the resource is still regional). <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ deep provides the fastest way to catch a goldfish (i.e. go to the desired URL).  After loading, deep works without any pauses, there are no requests to the server, deep does not even make ajax requests; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The concept of deep is simple: in fact, these are ordinary hyperlinks.  Navigation by the user is not difficult, all actions are familiar to anyone who has visited at least one site; <br>  ‚Ä¢ deep is understandable from the very beginning; in the implementation of deep neither flash nor silverlight nor any other technologies are used.  Using deep is not like using innovative, original or extravagant navigation concepts.  All that the user does and all that he observes is the standard actions on the web that the user performs every day many times.  Thanks to the familiar elements of the tag cloud technology, navigation in deep becomes even more intuitive; <br>  ‚Ä¢ in the end, deep original, I have not seen a similar implementation anywhere. <br><br>  Comments: <br>  - I ask you not to pay attention to the appearance and implementation of all other content of the site; <br>  - if you have encountered the same or similar navigation implementations somewhere, be sure to let me know; <br>  - Do not confuse deep c tag cloud.  In deep, there is no concept of tags at all, information is not tagged anywhere and similarity follows from the dependence of the context on the user's actions (this is one of the tasks); <br>  - in case there is a need, I could write another article describing the internal implementation of some deep concepts; <br>  - deep is a concept, some alpha-version, which is subject to further technical optimization (scripts and css).  But at the same time, deep now fully implements what is required. <br><br>  PS: ‚Äúthere are no errors in the article!‚Äù - unfortunately, this is impossible to say, but I will be glad if you pay my attention to the error you found. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25185/</a></p>
