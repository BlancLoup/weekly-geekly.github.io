  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MySQL Embedded and License</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I would like to use a bunch of MySQL Embedded + ZeosDBO + Delphi 7, but nowhere did I find a clear answer on licensing it.  All that I stumbled upon, there were some obscure amounts and the worst thing was that the maximum answer was found on mysql.ru, but which was clearly not over.  The connection with SUN Microsystems did not bring any results, they play ‚Äúfootball‚Äù, call one, call there, call from there, let them switch.  Requests through their own form, too, did not lead to anything.  In general crap. <br>  So, I‚Äôve collected what I‚Äôve gathered today and what questions still remain: One of two conditions must be met for distribution to my customers: either the software is distributed by the GPL or a payment FOR EVERY WORKWAY ~ 325 Euro / working place. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> This post is not created for MySQL vs "other databases" or Delphi 7 - sucks to the firebox.</i>  <i>Everyone has their own development tools and different tasks and different clients.</i> <i><br></i> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Naturally, such conditions are simply ‚Äúhellish‚Äù not acceptable.  This amount is not commensurate with the amount of $ 200-250 for the installation, and even then this money includes travel to the client, those support for 3 months.  Those.  the amount of the cost of 1 license exceeds 2 with a piece of the program cost. <br>  I agree to pay a $ 1-2000 license for a developer, but under a royalty-free license, because otherwise it makes no sense, for $ 550-700, I‚Äôd rather put Postgres hemorrhoids instead and load the guys to come to the companies.  But I don‚Äôt want to raise the amount, since the project is mostly social and very useful for ALL AGES OF THE POPULATION, even for those who simply don‚Äôt know how to use the Internet or not even money for it.

      Now let's play around with possible solutions, who knows if some of the lawyers help, I don‚Äôt want to give up so easily. <br><br>  <b>Option 1:</b> GPL license required, okay.  Developing the Hello World program, open the source code, make an easy site for it, also use the GPL license and also open the so-called.  API.  We create a commercial plugin, for example "CARS" and fasten to the API "Hello World".  As far as I understand, we yes, violate the GPL license for which Hello World is distributed, but this ‚ÄúHELLO WORLD‚Äù will not sue for violating the license, theoretically, and MySQL cannot sue the ‚ÄúCARS‚Äù developer as they use the OPEN API ‚ÄúHELLO WORLD‚Äù .  They also can not make any claims to the developer of ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù, since he provides a license under the GPL and is an open-source product. <br><br>  <b>Option 2:</b> What exactly is the distribution under the GPL?  If, for example, we don‚Äôt sell software to the client with the built-in libmysqld.dll (only this lib is needed), we offer to download it from a third-party or official resource, or the system is sold as SUPPORT over this library. <br><br>  <i>So far, no other options come to mind, although it would have been better if the Sanovites would not drive with the price, but they would have reacted humanly to the developers, I don‚Äôt know how in the USA and Europe, but it‚Äôs easier for us to simply shift the responsibility to a fictitious company and take money not for software, but for INSTALLATION of the software of the Nevedoma-Zverushka-Soft company.</i> <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> This post is not to try to steal, but for the most part the hope that at least someone from SUN Microsystems (and there are branches in Russia and Ukraine) will see and still give a clear answer to the question of whether open , without ‚Äútheft‚Äù and such ‚Äúworkarounds‚Äù, use of the file libmysqld.dll.  I do not want to ‚Äústeal‚Äù - but I also do not have the opportunity to pay the exorbitant ‚ÄúTribute‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57674/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57674/</a></p>
