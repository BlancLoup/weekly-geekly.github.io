  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Phone Security Labels - First Law Enacted</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is worth noting this day in red; for the first time in the world, a law has been passed stating that phone sellers should indicate the level of radiation on the label, that is, SAR.  San Francisco became a progressive city, and the law was passed by the city council.  All sorts of technical details are stipulated, for example, the font must be visible and cannot be less than 11 sizes.  Is this good or not? <br><br>  From my practice I can say that people pay attention to the level of radiation.  Not everyone, but those who are worried about all sorts of consequences, not really understanding their essence.  Of the several tens of thousands of letters per month, about 20 are devoted to choosing a phone with a minimum SAR or questions about how to protect yourself from the "harmful" radiation of the phone.  Hilarious advice - to close the phone in a metal safe and throw it into the sea.  No radiation. <br><br>  SAR is not an indicator of harm to the phone, this indicator only indicates that: <br>  a) when the phone is in operation, body tissues heat up by so many degrees in a certain time; <br>  b) serves as a limiter for phones that do not fall within the norms accepted for each country, for example, for the USA it is 1.6 W / kg.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you look at the SAR level for different devices, we will see that it ranges from 0.1 to 1.4.  The difference in order.  And you know what, the most unusual?  No one can argue that a radiation level of 0.1 (not even radiation, but its effects and heat) is better than 1.0.  There are no such studies.  Moreover, the SAR level has never been used for biomedical research.  The creation of this indicator was necessary to limit the power level of the phones, even in the days of analog devices.  But along the way, the analog networks disappeared, digital appeared, the radiation power dropped due to the change in technology, but the indicator was left. <br><br>  Is the SAR level useless?  For the buyer, this indicator does not say anything.  altogether.  This is a kind of psychological comfort.  But only.  A person buying and choosing a phone with a low SAR will convince himself that he is safe.  I am sure that the San Francisco initiative in the USA will spread and marketing races for the safest telephone will begin. <br><br>  The situation reminds me of a story with additives in food, which are marked on the packaging.  Those little Exxx.  Do we refuse to eat with such additives?  Not.  Because, another food does not exist today.  Are these supplements harmful?  Not.  The question is in their number.  I have several friends, over the age of 50, who consider any supplement E to be absolute evil.  But buy them.  This is a necessary measure for them, it is unpleasant for them to have such products, but there are no others (some categories of products cannot do without such additives at all).  When you explain that often behind such a number lies the usual substance used in everyday life and in cooking, they rejoice and ask why it was added to the ‚Äúharmful‚Äù one.  They do not understand that this is not a list of harmful additives, as it was advertised by the media in the 90s.  This is just a list of constituents.  Similarly, with the SAR level.  This is just an indicator that does not guarantee the safety of the phone. <br><br>  My bad advice about the safety of conversations: <br><br>  - Do not speak for long, do not speak for hours on a mobile phone.  If you still have to, then use a wired headset or bluetooth headset; <br><br>  - When buying a new phone, find out where its antenna is located.  Ideally, it will be in the lower part of the body and behind.  Radiate such a device will be in your jaw, but not in the head (this is advice for paranoids, but suddenly someone will need it); <br><br>  - It is better to talk 5 times for 2 minutes than once but at ten minutes (the tissues are heated with constant exposure); <br><br>  - During dialing, do not hold the phone at the ear, hold it in your hand, bring it to your head when the connection is over; <br><br>  - If you use data transfer without your participation (checking mail, ICQ and so on), then keep the phone in your bag, let it radiate to your keys; <br><br>  But in general, I can say that common sense has not been canceled.  Talking up to an hour a day on the phone, you are unlikely to run into problems.  And keep track of the state of your devices, deterioration of communication, interference, breaks in conversations after the phone crashes, all this requires a visit to a normal service center and checking how your phone works.  It can be corrupted and, indeed, radiate from the bottom of the heart (in my practice there were only a couple of such cases, but God protects the saves). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96604/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96604/</a></p>
