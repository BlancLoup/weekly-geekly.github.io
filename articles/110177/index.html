As the elements of the sorting array in this post are numbers. <br>  <b>The case with the unique elements of a small array</b> <br>  CUDA was chosen as a platform for reasons that can be considered brand or individual.  In fact, <a href="http://gpgpu.ru/">there are a</a> lot of examples <a href="http://gpgpu.ru/">here</a> at CUDA, and at the moment it has received more development in GPU computing than similar platforms from ATI and OpenCL. <br>  A web search for sorting algorithms on CUDA gave different results.  Here is the most <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/dcs/gpuqsortdcs.html">interesting</a> .  There is a drawing <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2fe/126/a6e/2fe126a6ed00fb984b3d43c8c413746d.png" alt="image"><br>  which shows that the best result was given by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">QSORT</a> algorithm, which gives the complexity of the order from O (NlogN) to O (N ^ 2).  And although parallelization on GPU gave the best result in the article, the doubt crept in that QSORT is not the best way to use the resources of a video card for this task (especially it scared the size of the above code).  The following describes the solution of the problem, in fact ‚Äúone line‚Äù with the <s>complexity of the</s> <i>time complexity</i> O (N) in the worst case. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, what we have: modern video cards have more than 500 * 32 streams (GTX275), operating simultaneously, about 15,000. <br>  I had the following conditions for the sorting problem: an array with a length of up to 1000 elements (the general case with a large value is considered further, but I had this).  Sorting such an array with O (NlogN) time, with 15,000 threads, seemed somehow wasteful. <br><br>  As a result of papyrus reasoning, it was found that, in order to achieve the best speed, and this O (N) it is necessary that each thread working simultaneously performs no more than O (N) operations.  That is, once passed through our array.  And the result of the pass must be a key that determines the position of one element in the resulting sorted array. <br>  Knowing the tid's own thread number (usually from 0..MaxThreads-1), the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfinding the position of the tid-element as a result was used. 
      <br>

      <br>
      Taking the original array as A [] = {1,5,2,4,7}, we assign the <u>task to each thread</u> ‚Äî <i>find the position of the element A [tid] in the resulting array B []</i> . <br><br>  To do this, we set up an auxiliary array K [] - the position of the element A [tid] in the result.  ArraySize is the number of elements in A []. <br>  Now the <s>source code itself is a</s> fragment of the implementation of the proposed algorithm on CUDA \ C (.cu file): <br> <code>1.  MainKernel ( kernel.cu)  ArraySize . <br> MainKernel &lt;&lt;&lt;grids, threads&gt;&gt;&gt; (A,B,ArraySize,MaxThreads); <br> <br> 2.  CUDA- MainKernel ( kernel.cu)  A[], ArraySize, MaxThreads,  B[]  K[]. <br> unsigned long tid = blockIdx.x*blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; //    <br> for (unsigned long i = 0;i&lt;ArraySize;++i) //  O(N) <br> if (A[i]&lt;A[tid]) <br> ++K[tid]; //      O(1) <br> <br> 3. __syncthreads(); // <s>    </s>     , ..  tid-       <br> <br> 4. B[K[tid]] = A[tid]; //     ( O(1),     3     qsort, swap  ..) <br> *      ,       K[]={0,0,2,3,4}. <br>     .4   ,       ( O(1)).      .</code> <br> <br>  And that's all, the resulting array B [] is sorted by O (N), provided that the number of threads available is greater than or equal to N. <br><br>  <b>The case with the unique elements of a large array</b> <br>  Now, if we increase the dimension of the array, we can use the same approach, only one thread will look for positions <br>  for [ArraySize / MaxThreads] - (whole part from division) of elements.  In this case, the running time of the algorithm will change to [ArraySize / MaxThreads] * O (N), that is, it will increase as many times as the number of array elements is greater than the number of threads available. <br><br>  For such a case, the implementation of the algorithm will take the form: <br> <code>1.  MainKernel ( kernel.cu)  [ArraySize/MaxThreads] . <br> MainKernel &lt;&lt;&lt;grids, threads&gt;&gt;&gt; (A,B,ArraySize,MaxThreads); <br> <br> 2.  CUDA- MainKernel ( kernel.cu)  A[], ArraySize, MaxThreads,  B[]  K[]. <br> unsigned long tid = blockIdx.x*blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; //    <br> <br> 2.5.    ,     . <br> unsigned long c = ArraySize/MaxThreads; <br> for (unsigned long j = 0;j&lt;c;++j) { <br> unsigned int ttid = c*tid + j; //    -       <br> <br> for (unsigned long i = 0;i&lt;ArraySize;++i) <br> if (A[i]&lt;A[ttid]) <br> ++K[ttid]; //   <br> <br> 3. __syncthreads(); // <s>    </s>     , ..  tid-       <br> <br> 4. B[K[ttid]] = A[ttid]; //     <br> } //  </code> <br> <br>  <b>Conclusion 1</b> <br>  The promised final sorting algorithm for one stream with number tid, written in one line: <br> <code>for (unsigned long i = 0;i&lt;ArraySize;++i) if (A[i]&lt;A[tid]) ++K[tid];</code> <br>  Was: A [i] - unsorted array.  Now K [tid] contains indexes of the positions of the original elements in the result.  The sorting order is easy to change by choosing between B [K [tid]] = A [tid] and B [ArraySize-K [tid] -1] = A [tid]. <br><br>  <b>Example with data from the beginning</b> <br>  It was: A [] = {1,5,2,4,7}.  ArraySize = 5. Run the threads 5. <br>  Flow 0. tid = 0. Set K [tid] = K [0] for A [tid] = A [0] = 1: K [0] = 0 <br>  Stream 1. tid = 1. Set K [tid] = K [1] for A [tid] = A [1] = 5: K [1] = 3 <br>  Stream 2. tid = 2. A [2] = 2.  K [2] = 1 <br>  Stream 3. tid = 3. A [3] = 4.  K [3] = 2 <br>  Stream 4. tid = 4. A [4] = 7.  K [4] = 4 <br>  Everything.  Now, since all the threads were executed at the same time, then we spent time only on enumerating the array - O (N).  And got K [] = {0,3,1,2,4}. <br><br>  <b>Features</b> <br>  When [ArraySize / MaxThreads] is <s>significantly greater</s> &gt;&gt; ArraySize this algorithm takes complexity greater than O (N ^ 2). <br>  I also do not recommend using it when it is not known in advance whether the elements of the original array are unique. <br><br>  <b>Conclusions 2</b> <br>  Thus, the original problem was solved for O (N) at worst and O (N) at best (acceleration was only due to N streams of course).  And then, provided that the available number of threads is not less than the number of elements of the sorted array. <br><br>  This post should help novice algorithms researchers to write interesting ideas for fast computations on GPGPU.  From the literature I note the book of Kormen algorithms and the portal of interesting problems projecteuler.net. <br><br>  <b>UPD1.</b>  (12/17/2010 13:40) <br>  In the process, it turned out that if the source array A [] takes 16KB of memory, it is still stored and the result of B [] <u>does not</u> work in __shared__ memory (and we use it in CUDA as a level 2 cache to speed up the calculations) - because  __shared__ size of only 16KB (for GTX275). <br>  Therefore, the algorithm is supplemented with ‚Äúparallel swap‚Äù, where the result is the original A []: <br> <code>1. for (unsigned long i = 0;i&lt;ArraySize;i++) <br> if (A[i]&lt;A[tid]) <br> K[tid]++; //   <br> <br> 2. __syncthreads(); // ! <br> <br> 3. unsigned long B_tid = A[tid]; //, ""    <br> <br> 4. __syncthreads(); //     ""  <br> <br> 5. A[K[tid]] = B_tid; //    </code> <br>  Now the source array A [] has become sorted using <u>less</u> memory. <br><br>  <b>UPD2.</b>  (12/17/2010 16:34, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/algorithm/110177/">including</a> ) <br>  Faster option due to less access to __shared__ memory and small optimizations. <br> <code>0. unsigned int K_tid = 0; <br> <br> 1. unsigned long B_tid = A[tid]; //, ""    <br> <br> 2. for (unsigned long i = 0;i&lt;ArraySize;++i) <br> if (A[i]&lt;B_tid) <br> ++K_tid; //   <br> <br> 3. __syncthreads(); //     ""  <br> <br> 4. A[K_tid] = B_tid; //    </code> <br> <br>  <b>UPD3</b> .
