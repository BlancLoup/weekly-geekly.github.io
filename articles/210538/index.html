Or a look at the conference organization by the program committee chairman Michael Bolton,</a> ‚Äù this will allow you to more clearly position your report.  We share the views of Michael Bolton and all that he says to a large extent applies to all conferences.

      <br>
      When submitting a report, answer the following questions: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Who is this report for? <br><br>  Determine your target audience, determine the level of the audience.  So it is necessary to submit an entry-level report, because at the conference there will be many people with experience of 2 years or more?  You do not need to submit a report for the sake of performance, you need to submit a report in order to share useful knowledge. <br><br>  2. What can your report give in practice? <br><br>  Reports are different: general education, systematizing, practical, etc.  Determine what your report is and what it will give to the listener.  If the listener, having listened to your report, is not able to endure anything for himself, this is obviously a failure.  Remember, you are not telling for yourself, but for people who value you.  Try to present information in such a way that it is not a special case for you, but so that it can be used or, at least, suggests ideas on how to use it.  Systematization of knowledge in some areas is also good, if their practical application is shown. <br><br>  As a result, more practice, less ‚Äúwater‚Äù! <br><br>  Do not forget that the report must comply with the stated topic and annotations!  Do not ignore it! <br><br>  3. Only the juice! <br><br>  Do not get carried away advertising your companies.  Your competence is the most important advertising.  Believe me, if you can competently talk about what you have encountered, you will be asked a lot of questions, including where you work, you will not be released on the sidelines.  Here you can tell about the company. <br><br>  Speaking at the conference, you earn a kind of rating, according to which you will be assessed in the future by both listeners and all other interested parties, including us.  Forget about the shovel "shredded" - give everything to the fullest and get pleasure from it. <br><br>  4. Do not forget to respond to reviewers comments. <br><br>  In the program committee involved current employees of companies.  This means that in addition to the main work, they pay attention to the reports and give feedback.  When submitting a report, do not forget to respond to the comments of the program committee, especially since you receive notifications.  We ask you to adequately and impartially relate to the opinion of reviewers.  Remember - they are your friends and try to help you make the most useful report.  It is not necessary to discuss the identity of the members of the program committee, this is a notorious failure.  Everything is simple and open with us - ‚Äúwithout ponts‚Äù. <br><br>  5. Do not forget to submit reports. <br><br>  Many are registered as speakers, but there are no reports.  Do not forget about the <a href="http://sqadays.com/article.sdf/sqadays/sqa_days15/for_speakers">deadlines for submitting reports</a> , as well as about the fact that if a report is not submitted, then there are no preferential conditions for participation in the conference.  ‚ÄúFake‚Äù reports will also lead to the fact that they will have to participate on a general basis.  Please treat reports with full responsibility.  In the end, you demonstrate the face of not only the company, but also your own as a specialist. <br><br>  6. What to tell? <br><br>  We do not make restrictions.  However, we can designate trends based on opinions from questionnaires from previous conferences (of course, these trends should not be limited): <br><br>  game dev <br>  - approaches to testing classic software and games. <br>  - what is the difference, what is the similarity? <br>  - How to change the mentality of the tester during the transition to the game development company? <br><br>  What do you pay attention to in the test object in the usual software? <br>  What began to pay attention in geymdev? <br>  How has the attitude to the life cycle of the system? <br>  How has the tooling changed? <br><br>  - how to change the mentality of the tester when moving to a classic software company?  is there a continuity of knowledge? <br>  - How are game engines tested? <br>  - what are the features of work in an international team?  (many games are developed by distant divisions) <br><br>  automation <br>  - practical and practically applicable (do not forget about the listeners!) Aspects of automation <br>  - Stress Testing <br>  - automation of mobile applications <br>  - game automation <br>  - automation of old applications (about it below) <br><br>  security <br>  - practical security testing methods <br>  - tester tools <br><br>  old (not so rare) applications <br>  - at various industrial enterprises, such applications manage the production process: from accounting to inventory management.  They are usually supported by the local IT department.  There still lives FoxPro, Access.  Applications are written under DOS and often do not have a Windows interface at all (often this can be found in banks, where unloading is done on a floppy disk).  Or are these desktop applications written in Delphi v.2.0 or CBuilder. <br>  - how to test the update of such applications? <br>  - Is it possible to use modern automation tools? <br>  - features of testing such applications? <br>  - how to build effective support for such applications? <br>  - Do you need to switch to new technologies if the old ones work well? <br>  - the problem of lack of documentation for old systems (all in the minds of the developers of the local IT department) <br>  - the problem of building processes in the introduction of new modern systems <br><br>  mobile development <br>  - testing applications for the main operating systems Android, iOS, Windows <br>  - application testing for rare and conditionally rare operating systems <br>  - test automation of such applications: features, practice, tools <br><br>  development of cross-platform applications <br>  - the main nuances of testing applications, complexity, approaches to testing <br>  - tools used <br><br>  features of testing development for the public sector <br>  - the basic construction of the process of testing applications for the public sector, especially the building of interaction with experts (who is responsible for what) <br>  - building the process of information exchange (how, in what environment, at what level to exchange the necessary information) <br>  - introduction of customers to modern IT tools <br>  - documenting the development <br>  - delivery and implementation <br>  - support <br><br>  cloud technologies <br>  - architecture of interaction of information storage servers (software managing such architecture) and testing of such architecture <br>  - testing data integrity in case of failures <br>  - data security (why are many still not moved to the clouds?) <br><br>  We invite everyone to the 15th anniversary <a href="http://www.sqadays.com/">SQA Days</a> .  It will be awesome ... as always.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210538/</a></p>
