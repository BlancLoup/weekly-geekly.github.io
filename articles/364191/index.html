Someone announced shooters with long complex names, someone put ten out of ten to another game that did not deserve ten out of ten - everything was as usual.  A trendy tablet on Windows 8.1 was lazily gathering dust on the table, a smart gamepad hadn‚Äôt been born out of a drawer for a couple of months.  We had to change something. <br><br>  And then something happens that turns the gray day inside out and completely changes the essence of things.  An idea came, and it was impossible not to take advantage of it. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúAnd what will happen if you connect the gamepad to the tablet and launch any game from the stack made for the wheelbarrow?‚Äù</i>

      In fact, not any, but some.  Games, in the end, turned out to be four, they are completely diverse, but all are made taking into account the features of the touch interfaces on phones and tablets.  This Halo: Spartan Assault, Asphalt 8, Dragon Revenge and Radiant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebc/83c/7b2/ebc83c7b2b4a4a51b8729d6770466d99.jpg"><br><br>  So, turn on the gamepad in the only free USB-port and start to have fun. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Radiant</b> <br><br>  It is difficult to be objective when you talk about a game that you are a fan of and played in a few years ago on a smartphone.  Now she is at arm's length, in the Windows Store, and involuntarily think about how far the game industry has gone over the past few years.  The Radiant game from the Hexage studio is a very cool adaptation of the prehistoric Space Invaders and Asteroids, which has a full story (‚Äúplot? Into space invaders? You are crazy!‚Äù), Cool gameplay, a whole bunch of weapons and excellent humor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f4/d65/527/3f4d655274d8b53e8675873bc6b2f914.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And it also supports the gamepad, and it improves the game at times.  The fact is that Space Invaders on the phone is a bit awkward.  It was controlled using tapas in the left and right parts of the screen, so the ship of the main character moved left and right.  Fingers cover some of the playing field and you can skip a bullet from the enemy, coins or weapons.  In the case of a joystick, there is no such problem; you just roll back 15 years ago at the time of Dendy and have fun, recognizing plot intricacies at the same time (which are revealed through radio communications between the space fleet commander, the main character and the "super-gad") and enjoying high-quality humor. <br><br>  By the way, with humor there is one moment - a Russian translation.  Do not consider me a militant snob, but the Radiant localizers tried to translate untranslatable jokes, and it turned out not always successful. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Plot plot</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb2/4ee/f9b/bb24eef9bddf4b84b9c784d136d53d05.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3b/d3d/ad9/d3bd3dad99d6458f84adc841518a5eb7.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da2/236/3e7/da22363e73bc4e02aeadfcc63123512a.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/280/298/804/280298804329409faec86555b0ed35df.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1dd/cbe/b0e/1ddcbeb0edb44cff87cc404a925c1b61.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c8/429/e5c/9c8429e5cc494850ab2398028e01ad72.png"><br></div></div><br><br>  And there are cool classic bosses.  And the game is really great to play on the joystick. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/09b9c32f-bfac-4ff9-ab83-1ecc535d0e25">Radiant</a> in the Windows Store.</i> <br><br>  <b>Dragon revenge</b> <br><br>  The game from the Novosibirsk studio Arello Mobile has a surprisingly simple goal - you play as a dragon who wants to burn everything and everyone and take your gold.  At first, when no one tries to kill you (which is about one level out of a million), the game seems simple, but as the location number increases, difficulty gradually increases.  For the sake of justice, it should be noted that the player also has new ways of destroying the game world, such as, for example, cobblestones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/715/4ff/911/7154ff9116e544b1ace1f25f98db3121.png"><br><br>  Dragon Revenge is perfectly adapted for the wheelbarrow, but it also plays well with the gamepad.  Support for vibration in collisions and shooting, smooth control from the sticks, that's all.  And the most important thing is that I don‚Äôt want to be distracted at all - the game is beautiful, with a pleasant soundtrack and there are dragons there!  Quoting the Arello Mobile CEO, ‚Äúeveryone wants to be a dragon, that's cool.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad0/42a/2d4/ad042a2d4b3847b29c7204cc9547ef3b.png"><br><br>  Definitely, you need to play Dragon Revenge - and play it on any Windows device you have available. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/7a060023-57a5-40f2-b7cd-6ea7d66c66f1">Dragon Revenge</a> in the Windows Store.</i> <br><br>  <b>Asphalt 8: Airborne</b> <br><br>  The eighth part of the ageless series - this is the way to talk about the next continuation of the next racing games.  Gameloft tried and made a beautiful arcade about cars.  There are a lot of machines, and if you wish, you can easily purchase them for in-game currency.  But we are not talking about currency - Asphalt 8 gives a very nice picture on almost any device and does not slow down at all.  Add to this all sorts of ways to control the vehicle (including the above-mentioned gamepad) and get good fun for those who love racing, loves to play from the couch, but does not want to spend a lot of money on top games.  Asphalt 8: Airborne is <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/asphalt-8-airborne/9076a406-495e-4aac-8153-6d3695f88650">free in the Windows Store</a> , so it‚Äôs worth going to download it right now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/381/cc1/217/381cc121783349ab92539209f649c87b.png"><br>  Although, of course, such flights are more like TrackMania :) <br><br>  <b>Halo: Spartan Assault</b> <br><br>  Who would not be there, but to play the shooters on the touchscreen is a pleasure then.  For shooters, humanity came up with mice and gamepads: it is a law of nature and it would be strange to break it.  Therefore, the last game of the evening with the controller from xbox360 was just Halo.  The part about the lonely Spartan, about the rebellion, pain, destruction and chaos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c1/f0d/be7/9c1f0dbe79eb40df81de8b0b5fcff07c.png"><br><br>  There are two control methods available in Haylo - a mouse + keyboard and a gamepad.  And to be honest with you, the mouse completely loses the joystick in playability.  The only plus point of the mouse is a more accurate aiming, but the separation of all other control capabilities also grieves directly at the keyboard.  In addition, we are talking about a tablet, and it is very difficult to connect the entire set of control devices to it.  And you get used to the gamepad control very quickly. <br><br>  According to the game: a good space shooter with good graphics and attractive sound.  Regarding the plot - it is available. <br>  <i>You can try Halo: Spartan Assault <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/2b614993-8e80-4259-ba02-98f8e7fec465">in the Windows Store</a> ,</i> where you can also find and buy the full version if you like the game. <br><br>  This ended the evening in the company of the tablet, gamepad and games.  Someone from the Petersburg edition of this blog put the tablet on the shelf, returned the joystick to the table, and went to read a book on how to develop computer games.  It was autumn 2014, it was dark outside the window. <br><br>  Share in the comments those games that you play on PC gamepads!  Give discussion and fun in the comments! <br><br>  See you later, Hiktames! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364191/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364191/</a></p>
