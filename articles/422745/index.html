  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Star of captivating knowledge</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You, most likely, have already heard about the educational center ‚ÄúSirius‚Äù.  Established in 2014 and created on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure, the center not only works with gifted children, but also raises the level of teachers and is looking for new forms of education.  This summer I had the opportunity to teach a space vacation program there for two weeks.  Under the cut, a tour of the center, a story about exactly what I was doing and everyday sketches.  Only 56 photos on 18 megabytes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ec/pf/ty/ecpftytgdgv4ratujb75cto1lg0.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Excursion </h2><br>  The science and art park of the educational center ‚ÄúSirius‚Äù is located in the building of the former Main Media Center of the 2014 Olympics and is comparable in size to a rather big plant - the facade is four hundred meters wide and the scale is best seen in the satellite image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oy/pp/az/oyppazerrzcdoh7iury3lo4uock.jpeg">

      Pay attention to the dark stripes - this is the glass roof of the galleries.  In 2017, a 0.03 product was installed at the main entrance - the Burana complex test stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xx/or/e6/xxore6whgwkyutu6pakj_fu2tom.jpeg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúComplex stand‚Äù means that this instance was equipped with a regular set of equipment and conducted a huge amount of testing, catching 21,168 bugs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hw/gc/de/hwgcde2ibzn__2np1fcklwlc6rg.jpeg"><br><br>  OK-KS - one of the best-preserved ships and program layouts.  For example, ‚ÄúBuran‚Äù on VDNH is assembled from three different products.  And here except that the absence of thermal protection and orientation engines is striking.  For convenience of testing, several manholes were made in the stand, which were absent in flight copies.  One of them is located in the wheel housing and is closed with a padlock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wd/3h/yp/wd3hypxeddh0y98fxjdaieedyrc.jpeg"><br><br>  In the left (north) vestibule next to the abstract satellite mockup is the mockup of the second-stage engine (central unit) of the RD-0120 booster rocket.  The center is actively filled with expositions and various artifacts, for example, the white border on the left was the entrance to the module of geospatial technologies, which is replaced by ‚ÄúGenetics and Life Sciences‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9z/f9/qp/9zf9qpykigja1us6zcok7b8ridq.jpeg"><br><br>  We rise to the second floor.  Here are the planetarium and the full-size mock-up of the Clipper spacecraft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d_/u8/ia/d_u8iaajzpmrcuxd5oahwc9pcdk.jpeg"><br><br>  View of the "Clipper" from behind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bs/f4/eb/bsf4eb7xguwiguru5xrvlbzw4zq.jpeg"><br><br>  There is still plenty of space, and the second floor is subtly similar to the airport.  Glare tile floor create the illusion of the pool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ep/ck/zn/epckznjz1yod5-9bzpi0z_gt4-o.jpeg"><br><br>  The industrial scale of the premises allows for events with hundreds and thousands of participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ya/uq/wq/yauqwqjvy0bftsvwg_idnecugbk.jpeg"><br><br>  Go back to the first floor.  The diagram of the audience once again clearly shows the size of the center.  Alpha - biohacking laboratories and nanotechnologies, Beta prototyping, circuit engineering, space and vehicles, Gamma - painting, pottery and mosaic, Delta - audience and conference rooms, Sigma - exhibitions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rj/ti/ul/rjtiuljbolave0vxb7s-7s4qwdq.jpeg"><br><br>  We begin, of course, with space laboratories.  In the corridors are models - icebreakers, reactors, "Luna-16", "Energy", "Soyuz", "Proton" and "Angara". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ik/t6/4j/ikt64jmnc6pjiyg5bblwb5xpvdi.jpeg"><br><br>  Autographs astronauts who visited the center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4a/8i/tr/4a8itrhpk8ej90-zaqaea5oj6fg.jpeg"><br><br>  Surprise and admiration causes equipping laboratories in general, and space - in particular.  With the help of Sputnix, they installed complete equipment for testing spacecraft.  Two stands allow you to check the orientation systems - a simulator of a magnetic field and a searchlight playing the role of the Sun, create an environment similar to what the satellite will collide in orbit, and the aerosolve simulates conditions when the satellites turn in weightlessness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/84/-s/27/84-s27y7z-zugdoeebxtwta6dum.jpeg"><br><br>  Aerostol removes friction in two planes, allowing you to experiment with the work of the satellite engines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ib/u5/he/ibu5hem33vozcsjmcf3cc5aa4xu.jpeg"><br><br>  And this is a stand with engines on compressed gas, which moves along the aerostol. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bt/1m/tt/bt1mttlfe2tnbclh-7u8_exf6g0.jpeg"><br><br>  Thermal chamber allows you to check the readiness of the satellite to work in a vacuum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iv/dk/zy/ivdkzyvqzqrsy2esjcso4aen2tw.jpeg"><br><br>  Shaker - the load when removing the satellite on the launch vehicle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bc/ti/hm/bctihmkvtzrwbebqzw6qzzgyfpm.jpeg"><br><br>  From the project shift, which lasts a month, remained mock satellites.  Wooden cases on adhesive tape with hot melt do not reduce the value of the knowledge and experience gained on real electronics.  And after visiting this laboratory, you are not surprised at the news about the launch of the ‚ÄúSIRIUS‚Äù created by the students of the ‚ÄúSirius‚Äù with the ISS and tested on this very equipment of real satellites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mm/8r/ky/mm8rkyuu_zzjvm8_3umrkrzjnba.jpeg"><br><br>  Go to the prototyping lab.  Here you can quickly and in various ways realize some great idea in the material.  3D printers, a whole battery, and, as I did not pass by, at least one of them constantly printed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xo/7a/0k/xo7a0kkuryt5vxptvuutjjczdt8.jpeg"><br><br>  In some cases, it will be better to cut a part than to print, for this there is a high-precision CNC engraving and milling machine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zp/oj/0g/zpoj0gqcxexlp7lufsnsu4okkds.jpeg"><br><br>  The alternative is a laser cutting machine, wooden parts with characteristic dark edges are everywhere, it obviously works a lot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sr/5m/bi/sr5mbi5a_-ubtkkc8r-keb7-6go.jpeg"><br><br>  A local landmark is a homemade 3D clay printer.  As I was told, they tried to print it with food, but something normal turned out so far only with chocolate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ln/r6/fu/lnr6fukn3gncgi48eqww1hnfsow.jpeg"><br><br>  On the shelves are experiments with rare delta-kinematics of 3D printers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zz/uw/e-/zzuwe-z8_unwsjfmho-v1-7gihm.jpeg"><br><br>  Go to the pottery lab.  Here are the results of 3D printing with clay, demonstrating the possibility of creating objects with a complex surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ox/5w/5h/ox5w5h8hnzpcyru-qirkjwkelma.jpeg"><br><br>  On a close-up, the layers with which the material was applied are clearly visible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5q/vs/4k/5qvs4k_r3-pgm81cawov2mqugqw.jpeg"><br><br>  The audience with pottery circles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gg/hz/c4/gghzc4kwypr-mvv4axbzly-dss4.jpeg"><br><br>  The results of a more traditional production process.  Cute seals and a plate with the words "There is no sense in fear of heights, it makes sense to learn to fly." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fz/jc/cz/fzjcczpwng92z5j9ujcxarg2opc.jpeg"><br><br>  Production is almost waste-free - unsuccessful experiments can be loaded into a machine similar to a meat grinder, and turned into a homogeneous mass, from which to sculpt something new. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sd/4i/pz/sd4ipz1d6wmfpepfc7xqlyn-kso.jpeg"><br><br>  And here the products are dried (the extreme closet on the right) and burned (all the rest). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f0/iv/iw/f0iviwl5jv6nlei0gn776wn7ypg.jpeg"><br><br>  Next in line is the space ‚ÄúPolygons‚Äù with plants, modern art and information technology.  At the special racks are growing student work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/_j/on/vq_jon0cqitrc5wlm8gstpvffty.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zx/p-/hp/zxp-hpbt-k4bhwxvzhvwnwkd-vy.jpeg"><br><br>  The compartment dedicated to hydroponics is covered with plastic curtains to maintain the microclimate.  Here are the most common systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/is/p7/s1/isp7s1vprusen6osp08bpra-mqu.jpeg"><br><br>  The wick system simultaneously demonstrates the ability of plants to determine local gravity and grow upwards.  An excellent addition would look <a href="http://www.valleyflora.ru/geotropizm.html">klinostat</a> , maybe in the future will add. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1x/jv/dt/1xjvdtrn6i9phjymt3bcutlqvk0.jpeg"><br><br>  Stands with plants a lot, and different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cm/hf/ix/cmhfix64rebxcr5dzaag4wy4eya.jpeg"><br><br>  One of the walls is highlighted by modern art.  This installation, for example, is inspired by the works of Pavlov, not alive, but reacting to the movement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6r/97/bt/6r97btt40u730cijfig7pv_fgbe.jpeg"><br><br>  The next sector is dedicated to human-machine interaction.  There is a booth with a trainer of emotional intelligence, stands controlling the look and even breathing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vy/qy/qr/vyqyqrszeuzuq4mbtzteewsueaw.jpeg"><br><br>  A pretty stand shows the life of a cell on a spherical screen with a flat cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q-/lc/ee/q-lceeexa5afr9c4bkqelm98pfi.jpeg"><br><br>  The smart home is presented in the form of, literally, a hut on mechanical legs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y8/fg/wl/y8fgwl7u53gzql9ptv2hbqzkbwg.jpeg"><br><br>  Holographic pigs illustrate the operation of a system capable of understanding and answering a question asked in a free form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mu/gf/yd/mugfydxed6tdprxay_1uiu1yx4o.jpeg"><br><br>  At the laboratory of biohacking and molecular biology, you can only look outside, but, thanks to the glass walls, this is enough.  A lot of equipment - there is even a DNA sequencer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nk/ja/kk/nkjakko9jbqpgilsalachktr_sa.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hq/yx/v_/hqyxv_g4glu03b-6_ipy0mmlmcg.jpeg"><br><br>  Well, the last point of our tour is the exposition ‚ÄúSmart City‚Äù, created with the participation of the Moscow government.  Here, in the form of visual games for children, modern concepts are shown.  Here, for example, a stand illustrating the work of Big Data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i1/0n/es/i10nesahd6rotsh7vtld3ogrqjs.jpeg"><br><br>  And here you can jump on interactive aerobics and find out how smart sensors can be useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q8/np/v9/q8npv9is6d0crbgcfpgym57qzwg.jpeg"><br><br>  By the time the little guests grow up, the ‚Äúdiagnosis of the future‚Äù will at least partially become the ‚Äúdiagnosis of the present.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qx/ks/sn/qxkssngynph2u19ic8xwzj_r7ke.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Job </h2><br>  In ‚ÄúSirius‚Äù there are programs of different duration, orientation (in three directions: ‚ÄúScience‚Äù, ‚ÄúArt‚Äù and ‚ÄúSport‚Äù) and for different ages.  I was invited to a vacation program lasting one week, for ages 12-15 years.  For six days and twenty hours, students must make a project that will defend itself in the final.  I have not taught since 2012, and the students there were older, but, fortunately, the <a href="https://habr.com/post/362263/">space school</a> has been working in Ufa for many years, with the head of which, Alexei Allikas, you can ask for advice.  As a result, on the basis of what I can do (for example, I didn‚Äôt work with the hardware and I couldn‚Äôt teach the satellite) and the teaching experience in similar conditions formed a program consisting of the following parts: <br><br><ol><li>  Theory: an introduction to astronautics and astronomy, orbital mechanics, the history of astronautics. </li><li>  Practice: flying in the space simulator Orbiter with a consistent increase in complexity.  First, we look at flights without active control, at the same time studying the work of space technology and acquiring basic skills, then we perform simple and more and more complex flights. </li><li>  Project: assembly of a model of a spacecraft and flight on it in Orbiter. </li></ol><br>  If you want to learn how to fly in the Orbiter, check out my publications: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/186728/">View scripts without piloting</a> . </li><li>  Simple flights: <a href="https://habr.com/post/212735/">geostationary orbit</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/post/215197/">flight to the ISS with docking</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/post/217503/">landing</a> . </li><li>  Difficult flights: <a href="https://habr.com/post/225549/">Jupiter</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/post/231991/">Moon</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/post/236693/">Mars</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/post/375805/">Mars-Earth flight</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://lozga.livejournal.com/%3Ftag%3Dorbiter">All materials on the Orbiter</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  The models were initially supposed to be made of paper, and I spent a lot of time rejecting those that are not suitable because of too much complexity or laboriousness, but in time I learned about the presence of 3D printers in the center, I switched to searching for models for which there are interesting addons. in orbiter.  There were four of them - the Soyuz spacecraft and the scenario of manual docking with the ISS, the Vostok spacecraft and the manual orientation of the spacecraft for landing, the Proton and access to the geostationary orbit and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter with aero braking at Mars. <br><br>  Printed models, from this grow ‚ÄúProton‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bt/ts/jf/bttsjfu44rdipj2bddzoh9l-sqw.jpeg"><br><br>  Projects protect all directions of vacation programs at the same time in the main hall.  This is good - the result of training is shown not only to their parents, but also to participants in other programs with their parents.  This is where my students join the Soyuz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/le/_-/dx/le_-dxoqdl4pn4epcnjbqvmpqmo.jpeg"><br><br>  The pottery program showed win-win seals, everyone loves them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wc/ew/l5/wcewl58qmfr8ds2bjd4zrtkxrmi.jpeg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúStep to the Universe‚Äù (8-11 years old) demonstrated rockets.  Alas, the practical start-up in the hall can not be held, so that it was carried out separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pe/me/la/pemelal460v-dudxxdkkkqrkkiw.jpeg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n696-_zWPPI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Chemical and physical experiments of the group of 12-15 years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sw/0h/bl/sw0hbllgmxgz-t1fyl1lghyx0c4.jpeg"><br><br>  The buoyers created at the ‚Äúschool of digital production‚Äù in the hall without the wind, alas, did not go, but they still looked pretty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u1/pn/-v/u1pn-vrmcrl905x3ebiuts_thnk.jpeg"><br><br>  But the most entertaining demonstration was at the school of robotics (8-11 years old).  All week the children collected and programmed the robot, and full-scale competitions were organized on the defense with the issuance of diplomas on the results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7r/pi/o2/7rpio2vsqh4isux_dvra7cqizqc.jpeg"><br><br>  Personally, I consider the main positive result of my work that the students themselves voluntarily wanted to fly and show their skills.  It is hoped that they will put the Orbiter at home and will play, while simultaneously studying the real orbital mechanics, astronomy and space technology.  And the fact that already saying goodbye, some students called my discipline the most interesting (and all programs were shown master classes in other areas) was the pinnacle of pedagogical joy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/1w/s8/pd1ws8w5cwhze4bxgjhsd3mj6bu.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Household part </h2><br>  The residential complex ‚ÄúSirius‚Äù is a former four-star hotel Azimut with the appropriate level of rooms.  In the first minutes of check-in it was funny to realize that the number is completely analogous to the Tyumen four-star hotel, where I was at Neforum bloggers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sv/0g/kg/sv0gkgxmt6iz0ysrotp0q0_yp0q.jpeg"><br><br>  The location is beautiful, 300 meters from the sea, in case of bad weather there is a swimming pool and spa.  In the right part of the photo is a science club.  Also on the territory there is a pond with a fountain, contributing to scientific reflections, simulators and tennis courts temporarily closed for repair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9w/x0/nd/9wx0nd0fr_b7zz4icmpewojbosq.jpeg"><br><br>  Very close to the facilities of the 2014 Olympics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cp/wn/cz/cpwncz9fhem4eebh1tjygq98gvc.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to the residential complex and the Park of Science and Arts, sports activities are held at the Puck Arena.  Electric shuttle buses run between the buildings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cz/9h/sj/cz9hsjqfmyuuansdyhzkzjgyyyc.jpeg"><br><br>  I also brought a monowheel by the transport company (on the plane) and rode it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MK3GCUtokBQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  The educational center ‚ÄúSirius‚Äù makes a very inspiring impression.  The combination of excellent educational and household equipment with people who love and know how to do their work, gives confidence in the future of students and the country as a whole.  It was a great honor for me to work there and make a small contribution to making our common tomorrow better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422745/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422745/</a></p>
