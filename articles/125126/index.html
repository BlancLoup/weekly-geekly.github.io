  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WM> Bank = Technical Overdraft</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now the market offers a wide range of services for the exchange, purchase and sale of electronic currencies. <br>  Many withdraw (cash out) WM while choosing the optimal exchange model for themselves. <br><br>  We all pay attention to phrases like " <i>We work for you 24 hours a day. Since the exchange of electronic money is fully automated, all requests for exchange are executed instantly.</i> ", The main criterion - I like it! <br><br>  Recently, I ran into a technical overdraft problem from scratch.  From the position of the bank, the essence is simple, and it is understandable to anyone, but not to the client, who performs a simple procedure for transferring electronic currencies and point A to point B.

      I will try to explain in steps when the ‚ÄúTechnical overdraft‚Äù occurs: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Suppose you have 10000 WMR and the desire to transfer them to an account in a bank.  Using the functionality of the electronic currency exchange service I chose the WM chain to the card account <br><br>  2. Having received a notification that the application of the exchanger has already been worked out, I visit the bank's website  Having made an extract in the interface, I see that my account has been credited to the amount (10000r minus the commission of the exchanger).  The key point is that the money arrived and the postulate " <i>We work for you 24 hours a day. Since the exchange of electronic money is fully automated, all requests for exchange are executed instantly.</i> " 100% satisfies my needs, and the fact of crediting the amount pleases :) <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Article 31. Settlement by a credit organization</b> <br>  <i>A credit institution, the Bank of Russia is obliged to transfer funds from a client and transfer funds to his account no later than the next business day after receiving the relevant payment document, unless otherwise established by federal law, contract or payment document</i> </blockquote><br><br>  If it is simpler and more accessible, your money should be credited to your account no later than 1 day from the time when you successfully completed the account / card recharge transaction. <br><br>  In this case, I would like to note that the fact of the receipt of money is the indicated amount in the ‚Äúclient cabinet‚Äù ie  in the web interface of the bank system. <br><br>  3. We turn on fantasy + needs + amount limits, do with money what your heart desires.  On the card account previously there was an amount in XXXX rubles.  As a result, for the realization of a dream there is a sum of XXXX rubles + what was transferred from WM.  Wow  Fantasy for a larger amount does not leave me a chance to spend everything at once. <br><br>  4. On the same day, I practically spend all the funds available to me as I please, BUT there is one moment that I learned about quite recently.  The point is that if you saw that your current account was replenished (in my case, I saw that the account was increased by XX money in the interface of the bank) this does not mean that ‚Äúthe operation is completed‚Äù.  We recall about "... crediting of funds to his account no later than the next business day after receiving the relevant payment document ...". <br><br>  The key question is - how does the client know that the funds transfer procedure has been successfully completed? <br>  The answer is no how.  Yes, the bank does not notify that the procedure was completed after 3 hours and 15 minutes or after 20 hours and 7 minutes. <br><br>  In my case, I spent all the funds available on that day BEFORE THE END CURRENT ENTRY operation (in this case we are talking about the completion of the operation at the server level that processes incoming requests). <br><br>  The situation is absurd, I replenished my account and then spent my own money, BUT because  I did everything right then got on the money.  Penny Bank accrued for getting into a technical overdraft. <br><br>  Summary of the post: electronic money is transferred faster than laws are written.  Your money is essentially ‚Äúyours‚Äù only when stored in your wallet.  The lack of information about the business processes of the bank at the client does not give a reason to be sure that he is right. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125126/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125126/</a></p>
