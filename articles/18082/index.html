  <section class="page js-page"><h1>8 reasons why we change jobs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Changing jobs is always stressful.  New place, new people (each with its own, yet unknown features), new rules and new responsibilities.  In my experience, the average time of adaptation in a new team is 2-3 months.  Plus, a job change is a risk.  The risk does not pass the trial period, do not take root in the new team, do not cope with the assigned responsibility. <br><br>  But, despite all this, people leave their homes.  After working 2/3/5 years or more in companies, they begin to learn a worklist, and, in the end, they leave. <br><br>  What caused this? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Few pay</b> <br>  Probably the most popular reason for changing jobs.  In principle, this is normal.  Why?  Well, on the one hand, I have never, for the whole time of my work, seen people fulfill only their official duties and nothing but them.  That is, after six months - a year, it comes to the realization that you work for one and a half or two people, but you receive one salary.  On the other hand, very often people, after long work at one place, have a feeling of their own importance and irreplaceability. <br>  On this occasion, Weller wrote well:

      <i>A person may not even bother to realize the importance of his work.</i>  <i>Time and nature will do it for him.</i>  <i>The system of his sensations will ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù over time so that a feeling of significance of his work arises - and this feeling will be ‚Äúbrought up‚Äù into consciousness ‚Äî and the consciousness will shape this feeling into arguments why his work is important enough and significant.</i>  <i>Arguments can be at any level - from ‚ÄúToday it‚Äôs not my turn to carry water!‚Äù To ‚ÄúWhere you are going, it‚Äôs impossible, you have the wrong seal on your pass!‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  On the third hand, professional growth and increasing responsibility have not been canceled.  And in many companies, the reaction of the authorities is rather slow, and it acts according to the principle - they don‚Äôt ask - it means that they are satisfied. <br><br>  The adequacy of the level of wages is a separate topic.  I have one friend who decided at one point that he should receive more.  He began to go to interviews in top companies.  How many times he failed them - history is silent, but he did not pass a trial period twice.  But the third time he did it all, and he began to receive 2.5 times more than at the first workplace. <br><br>  On the other hand, some people have a bias about money.  I met with a stereotype several times: I get $ xxx, and no one will pay more for this work.  And despite the fact that on any site with vacancies at that time it was full of offers with 1.5-2 times higher wages.  These sentences were dismissed as poor quality ... <br><br>  The main thing here is not to lose objectivity and, in an effort to get more money, not to forget about the development and state of the labor market.  To avoid the problem of price and value of the participation of this employee in the company. <br><br>  By the way, very often, when dismissed, the ‚Äúpay little‚Äù argument covers a whole range of problems (which, for one reason or another, have no desire to voice).  For example: <br><br>  <b>2. Lack of growth and prospects</b> <br>  Many people want to move forward, apply and develop new skills, use new technologies.  Moreover, any leader in words with both hands for the development of both employees and processes, in life everything turns out a little different.  The employee is often required to perform a certain sequence of actions to obtain a known result.  Attempts to make changes in the organization of processes or increased concern for quality can be perceived as sabotage.  It is clear that such an approach simply kills creativity and initiative. <br><br>  If, apart from the lack of professional development in such a company, no career growth is observed, an actively developing employee will become out of the way with the company within a year ... <br><br>  <b>3. The desire to change the scope of activities.</b> <br>  It so happens that in the course of work we understand that we are not doing what we really want to.  What is the problem?  And the fact that in the current sphere a person can already represent something of himself as a specialist, and nothing in the new one.  No experience, no knowledge, no necessary connections.  This is a very big risk. <br><br>  On the other hand, work on a new, desirable specialty will most likely be fueled by personal enthusiasm and interest - which at first may somewhat compensate for the lack of experience.  In any case, the desire to find yourself and do your favorite business is a worthy goal. <br><br>  <b>4. Problems in the team</b> <br>  Several times during my work I observed how quite qualified specialists were simply squeezed from the workplace.  Just because they did not agree with the authorities or the team.  It is very important to understand that dismissal is a departure from the problem.  If for the performer - this, in general, can be a solution, then for the manager - no. <br><br>  The reasons for such conflicts may be several: <ul><li>  Excessive categorization in judgments </li><li>  Intolerance </li><li>  Unwillingness to dialogue and avoid problems </li></ul> And so on‚Ä¶ <br><br>  In any case, if this problem has touched you - this is an occasion to think about improving your communication skills. <br><br>  <b>5. Change of bosses</b> <br>  A change of management in some cases can be equated to a change of job.  Especially if this happens because of the crisis.  Changing conditions and rules of work.  In this case, the change of leadership often occurs in a rather nervous and tense environment.  There is only one advice - not to give in to a general panic and having assessed the new working conditions to make a decision - should you continue working at this place or not. <br><br>  <b>6. I do not listen</b> <br>  Often, an employee of a company develops well during his work and receives the status of an expert in his field.  At the same time, there are also often problems related to the fact that the authorities do not listen to his expert opinions.  The problem here is that, firstly, this employee may not have a complete vision of the project picture or the company's activities (with a high level of technical knowledge).  Secondly, when making a decision, an employee risks in the worst case with his salary, while the company‚Äôs management risks his business.  That is, they will certainly listen to expert opinion, but a decision can be made taking into account factors unknown to the employee. <br><br>  What you can do is the fate of most people working for hire. <br><br>  <b>7. Working conditions</b> <br>  My first job at our office was bowling.  From 13 o'clock it was difficult to work without headphones.  Although they did not save from vibrations.  For fun, our sound engineers determined how many tracks were playing. <br><br>  In second place - the whole company (~ 15 people) worked in the same room.  It is not difficult to guess that the constant movement of people and a stable level of noise affected the performance is not particularly positive.  People are known to get used to everything ... <br><br>  Poor working conditions have never been put forward as the main reason for the dismissal of these companies.  But there was an additional and very significant factor when choosing a new place. <br><br>  <b>8. Dismissal</b> <br>  This is probably one of the most unpleasant reasons for changing jobs.  The main thing in this situation is not to try to blame all the problems on the authorities and not to panic.  Dismissal gives a good reason to reflect.  What is your real level?  What mistakes did you make?  Is there a desire to continue working in this area, or is it time to change the scope of activities? <br><br>  Dismissal is an extreme measure.  In addition, you should not assume that it brings any pleasure to the management.  For most managers, this decision is extremely painful.  But it means only one thing: you and the company are not on the way. <br><br>  On the same topic I want to quote another fragment from the book The Way of Trade: <br>  <i>****</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A pupil asked the Teachers: ‚ÄúTeacher, I can‚Äôt understand the essence of what everyone admires.</i>  <i>Namely: in Japanese, the hieroglyph, meaning the word "crisis", consists of two hieroglyphs, which mean "problem" and "opportunity".</i>  <i>So what?"</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The teacher frowned:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Really do not understand?</i>  <i>It's horrible!</i>  <i>Get out of school !!!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The pupil was taken aback:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- But tomorrow I can come back?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúYou will understand when you can return,‚Äù the Teacher snapped.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Two days passed, this student knocked on the door of the School.</i>  <i>The teacher came out to him and said:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Do not say anything, I will not believe you!</i>  <i>Get out!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The rest of the students stood behind him, afraid to even utter a word.</i>  <i>No one understood what caused such anger of the Master ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>About a year passed, and the student reappeared on the threshold.</i>  <i>The teacher carefully examined him, smiled and said:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Now you really understand.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And when the student came in, the Master invited him to tell everything to other students.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúThe day after I left the School,‚Äù the student said, ‚Äúthe owner of the company where I worked, said that he no longer needed my services.‚Äù</i>  <i>I guessed that it was not without Master there, and he came, but, you remember, Master drove me away again.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The teacher smiled:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúYou have no idea how difficult it was to persuade the boss to part with you.‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- I realized that later.</i>  <i>I tried very hard to find a job, but I could not find a suitable one, and I had to support my family.</i>  <i>Then I created my own company ... In less than a year - My company today is one of the largest in its field ... Now I really understood what these hieroglyphs mean and ... no words, Teacher, how grateful I am to you!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúGive thanks to the Path,‚Äù Teacher said as usual.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>****</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  <b>Work and personal effectiveness</b> <br>  How do the above problems affect personal effectiveness? <br>  It directly depends on: <br><ul><li>  Responsibilities </li><li>  Responsibility </li><li>  Terms of Work </li><li>  Collective </li></ul><br>  Agree that it is rather difficult for you to engage in unnecessary, nasty work in the same room with people who are unpleasant to you.  =) <br><br>  It is important to remember that the relationship between the employer and the employee, in general, is equal.  According to this, if you are not satisfied with something - solve the problem, there is no possibility - look for options, weigh, make a decision and act. <br>  But at the same time, it is necessary to understand that a change of work is to some extent a departure from problems.  In the new place - there will be other difficulties that will have to be solved in the same way (only your loyalty to the company and the management will probably be higher). <br><br>  What exactly you should not do is to endure and do nothing.  If you do not like the work - there is no desire to do it well, there is no development.  But there are nerves and a lot of negative emotions.  And it does not need you or the employer. <br><br>  <b>Appreciate your time.</b> <br><br>  Original <a href="http://deadline-as-lifestyle.blogspot.com/">here</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18082/</a></p>
