  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WiMax goes to the stock exchange</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to analyst firm In-Stat, the number of subscribers to WiMax wireless broadband services worldwide in 2006 does not exceed a modest figure of 222 thousand. However, over the next four years the market will grow to 19.7 million subscribers, that is, almost one hundred time.  And this is not the most optimistic forecast. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the same time, it is necessary to understand that WiMax services are provided primarily for Internet providers, commercial companies and government customers.  Having received the Internet "in bulk", they can resell it "at retail" via WiFi, so in reality, millions of ordinary users will benefit from the introduction of WiMax.  A bunch of ‚ÄúWiMax + WiFi‚Äù should become very popular.  For example, some American cities are already <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/12/05/clearwire-grand-rapids-michigan/">ordering WiMax for themselves</a> to cover the entire territory of the city with free WiFi hotspots. <br><br>  Although the entry of WiMax into the mass market is unnecessarily delayed, everyone understands that this will inevitably happen in the very near future, and the new technology has very good prospects.  It is interesting to observe how, under these conditions, the first WiMax startups <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2006/tc20061220_581789.htm">are trying to conquer the stock exchange</a> .  Immediately, two US startups, <a href="http://www.nextwave.com/">Nextwave</a> and <a href="http://www.clearwire.com/">Clearwire</a> , are planning an IPO.  And for Clearwire this is the second attempt. <br><br>  Nextwave and Clearwire startups filed for an IPO almost simultaneously: December 18 and 19.  Their access to the stock exchange is expected at the very beginning of 2007. Both companies plan to profit from the construction and management of basic WiMax networks.

      Of particular interest is the company Clearwire.  For the first time, the company voluntarily interrupted the IPO procedure at the beginning of this summer due to poor stock market conditions.  Investors of this promising startup are <a href="http://intel.com/">Intel</a> and <a href="http://motorola.com/">Motorola</a> (they have invested more than a billion dollars), and the legendary manager and billionaire Craig McCaw, who once built one of the first US cellular networks, is at the helm.  Already, Clearwire manages the current WiMax network, and the number of users has grown to 188 thousand. However, Clearwire has not brought a cent of profit yet.  For example, for the first nine months of this year, losses amounted to $ 65.5 million with revenue of $ 22 million. <br><br>  Analysis of the documents submitted to the SEC, as well as a survey of experts suggests that Clearwire will help out at least $ 400 million from the issue of shares. This is a good addition to the $ 1.25 billion that Clearwire already has at its disposal.  All this money will be invested in the purchase of frequency bands and the development of the WiMax network. <br><br>  However, in this market serious competition is expected.  For example, the American mobile operator <a href="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint Nextel</a> plans to spend about $ 2 billion over the next two years to build its own WiMax network.  In addition, Sprint has already "staked out" for itself a band width of 80 to 85 MHz in almost every region of the United States.  Sprint Vice President believes that full bandwidth needs at least 60 MHz bandwidth.  Clearwire ranks second in licensed frequencies: it owns a portion of the spectrum from 2.495 to 2.690 GHz. <br><br>  According to exchange experts, now is the most favorable time for issuing shares since 2000, especially for technology companies.  Proof of this are the latest examples.  For example, on September 21, 2006, <a href="http://www.riverbed.com/">Riverbed Technology, a</a> wireless equipment manufacturer, made an IPO.  Since then, its shares have risen by 210%. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4857/</a></p>
