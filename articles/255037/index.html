CloudLITE is an online store for cloud resources on the IaaS model based on VMware. <br>  The new service allows you to buy resources through the site and deploy a full-fledged virtual infrastructure in minutes.  In the store, you can select 5 ready-made configurations or create your own cloud using an online calculator. <br>  The cost of each configuration includes Internet bandwidth up to 10 Mb / s with unlimited traffic, 1 IP address, technical support, detailed SLA with availability indicator of 99.95% and, of course, a test drive, as much as a month.  Details at the end of the article.  For the most persistent. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Thank you all very much for your interest in CloudLITE.  For the first week we <b>already have more than 150 registrations</b> .  Special thanks to all those who did not keep in themselves and actively spoke out about the new service.  You help us a lot! <br>  The attraction of generosity continues, and we are still waiting for everyone for 1 month test drive, and our box <a href="http://feedback%40cloudlite.ru/">feedback@cloudlite.ru</a> - new proposals and comments;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bd/470/b70/0bd470b706de4519a4badaf9c6acbe85.png" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>For whom and what?</b> <br><br>  Initially, CloudLITE was conceived as a solution for large companies that need resources for test environments and development.  In such cases, business representatives are ready to abandon the "extra" nines in uptime, but to get an opportunity to save, while retaining the same functionality.  We followed this path, offering a lower cost and a more ‚Äúsoft‚Äù SLA (99.95%).  And they decided not to stop at this ... <br>  As a result, we have created a separate, fully automated service CloudLITE, in which the purchase of resources and the deployment of a virtual infrastructure takes place in a self-service format.  This allowed us to lower the price bar even lower and make the service, we hope, interesting for representatives of SMB, micro-business, as well as individual users. <br><br>  In addition to the operational organization of sandboxes, CloudLITE capabilities can be used for advanced hosting of online stores, media projects, blogs, etc., if you have exhausted the possibilities of virtual hosting and VDS / VPS, but the option with a dedicated server does not suit you. <br><br>  SMBs can host corporate mail and website, office applications and much more in CloudLITE's cloud infrastructure. <br><br>  We can say that we ended up with a kind of light-version of the CloudLine cloud in terms of service, SLA and cost, but with consistently broad IaaS functionality and reliable enterprise-level software and hardware solutions.  Well, and, of course, our experience <a href="http://partnerlocator.vmware.com/partner_locator_results%3FCompany%2BName%3Ddataline%26Country%3DRUSSIAN%252BFEDERATION%26CurrentPage%3D1%26Dist_Flag%3Dfalse%26First_Flag%3Dfalse%26PageSize%3D10">Premier-partner VMware</a> , has not gone away :). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eaf/b5a/969/eafb5a969dbb48668a9143bea838ee38.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>VCloud Director control panel</b> <br><br>  Cloud resources are managed using the vCloud Director control panel.  With her, you can: <br>  ‚Ä¢ create virtual machines of the desired configuration; <br>  ‚Ä¢ manage VMs (enable, disable, clone, create templates, etc.); <br>  ‚Ä¢ install any system and application software; <br>  ‚Ä¢ export and import VM images and templates; <br>  ‚Ä¢ create internal and routable networks (with access to the Internet or to external physical equipment); <br>  ‚Ä¢ flexibly manage user access rights to a pool of virtual resources; <br>  ‚Ä¢ powerful API (it should devote a separate post) <br>  and much more. <br><br>  For convenience, VM templates with preinstalled OS (Centos, Ubuntu, Linux, Windows, etc.) are already placed in the common directory. <br><br>  The panel has a very rich functionality.  To simplify the process of dating, we have prepared for you <a href="https://cloudlite.ru/faq/vcd">detailed instructions with screenshots</a> . <br><br>  <b>How is the cloud cloudite?</b> <br><br>  CloudLITE, like existing DataLine cloud services, runs under the control of the VMware vSphere 5.5 hypervisor. <br>  Thanks to the built-in balancer (Distributed Resource Scheduler, DRS), the load on the cluster is optimally distributed.  DRS continuously monitors the status of the cluster, and if one of the servers lacks some resource (processor, memory), then the balancer uses a live migration vMotion transfers some VMs from this server to less busy ones.  This avoids the struggle for resources between virtual machines and guarantees the same high power for all CloudLITE clients. <br><br>  Cluster fault tolerance is provided by VMware HA technology (high availability).  It allows you to quickly monitor failures in the hardware of a virtualization cluster and, in the event of a failure of one of the servers, migrate VMs to redundant cluster servers and restart them there. <br><br>  A distinctive feature of CloudLITE from other DataLine cloud services is the use of software defined storage class storage systems - VMware VSAN.  This solution combines industrial-level drives with an NL SAS interface and PCIe cache caching flash cards into a single distributed storage. <br><br>  The cloud is deployed on 4-socket servers Huawei FusionServer RH5885 V3 based on Intel Xeon processors.  Each server has 4 high-performance 10G Ethernet interfaces onboard.  High-performance Cisco Nexus 10G switches are used as network equipment. <br><br>  All equipment is located in the Tier 3 <a href="http://www.dtln.ru/tsod-nord/gallery">NORD 3 data center</a> in the north of Moscow ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhVytxBnycQk%26index%3D1%26list%3DPLqVZIPeC5H0kRG-Ay3mrkeElCXcNL-PVX">video tour for those who wish</a> ), which means that all elements of the engineering infrastructure are reserved (at least according to the N + 1 scheme), the premises and the surrounding area are carefully guarded. <br><br>  <b>SLA</b> <br><br>  Despite its ‚Äúsoftness‚Äù (99.95% instead of the traditional DataLine cloud services 99.982%), <a href="https://cloudlite.ru/files/document/prilozhenie_no_1_k_dogovoru_vozmezdnogo_okazaniya_uslug_oferta._soglashenie_ob_urovne_obsluzhivaniya.pdf">SLA CloudLITE is</a> no less detailed and covers all aspects of the service.  An availability rate of 99.95% means that a simple cloud service cannot exceed 4.38 hours per year or 21.56 minutes per month.  Another important indicator is performance: for a processor, it is up to 1200 MIPS / core, for a disk subsystem - up to 100 IOPS / 320GB. <br>  The SLA regulates our obligations regarding the speed of reaction to an incident, its resolution in accordance with the assigned priority, as well as penalties to us if we do not comply with them. <br><br>  <b>Personal account (billing)</b> <br><br>  We used <a href="http://velvica.com/">Velvica</a> solution as a billing platform and personal <a href="http://velvica.com/">account</a> , which allows us to fully automate the sale / purchase of cloud resources. <br>  Thanks to Velvica, CloudLITE users can create their own virtual data centers in our cloud, pay for resources through the site, replenish the account in your account, and track the entire history of debits.  Access to the cloud data center control panel is provided from the personal account directly, without additional authorization (single sign-on).  The platform also provides an opportunity to subscribe to cloud resources for legal entities with billing and other necessary documentation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33f/ba4/157/33fba41571e24b9b93e5806aa9ad6f31.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>To be continued‚Ä¶</b> <br><br>  In this version, we managed to implement not everything that we wanted, so we still continue to improve the existing functionality, remove bugs :) and add new features. <br>  In honor of the discovery, we give a whole month of free testing for configuration <b>2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM and 50 GB HDD</b> with all the stuffing (unlimited traffic, IP and other nishtyachki). <br>  We urge you to take an active part in testing the new service.
