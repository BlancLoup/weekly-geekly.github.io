The Avito.ru Android development team and I decided that this is an excellent opportunity to meet and get acquainted with colleagues programming at Kotlin, discuss language perspectives, share lessons learned in an informal setting, eat pizza, in general, with pleasure and benefit to spend the Sabbath day.  To do this, we will organize on February 27 the <a href="http://bit.ly/1Tohabr">‚ÄúAndroid Development with Kotlin‚Äù</a> mitap, join us! <br><br>  In the program of the meeting we have a special guest, a representative of the JetBrains team, Dmitry Zhemerov, who will talk about what Kotlin 1.0 is offering Android developers today, what opportunities will appear in the near future.  The Avito.ru team has long used the combination of Kotlin and Rx, we have already released two applications in production where there is not a single line in Java.  We are pleased to share our experience and approaches.  The report of our third speaker, Vladimir Mironov, will be devoted to delegated properties, a topic that worries those who have already managed to dive into the development of Kotlin.  <a href="http://bit.ly/1Tohabr">Register</a> and come to the meeting, invite colleagues and friends!

      Under the cat more about the speakers, the program and format of the event. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First, the most important, speakers and reports that will be presented at the meeting. <br><br>  Those who follow the development of Kotlin do not need to introduce Dmitry Zhemerov, Principal Engineer, to the JetBrains team, one of the first language developers, the head of the team developing the plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, co-author of the book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action">Kotlin in Action</a> .  At the meeting, Dmitry will talk about new features that Kotlin provides Android developers as of version 1.0, as well as what to expect in future versions (incremental compilation in Gradle, support for Lint checks, new features in IDE, reduced runtime size and so on).  In order for everyone to have the opportunity to ask all the questions that have accumulated, we will organize a separate Q &amp; A section. <br><br>  Vladimir Mironov has been working on Android development for more than four years, during which time he managed to work on several projects, including in the Odnoklassniki company.  Last year Vladimir works in a small startup and writes all the code exclusively on Kotlin.  His report will be devoted to delegated properties, a topic that raises many questions.  Find out why they are needed, what delegated properties the standard library provides, let's write a few examples, see what the delegated properties turn into during compilation. <br><br>  I am developing a professional tool for Avito.ru users.  We recently released two applications in production, written entirely in Kotlin, with an architecture built around Reactive Extensions.  I will talk about those language tools that allow writing to Rx cleanly and reliably.  I will get acquainted with the Rx libraries, where the power of Kotlin is already used to the full, I will touch upon the questions concerning testing. <br><br>  In addition to all of the above, we will have time to socialize in an informal setting, having a snack on pizza. <br><br>  The meeting will be held at the Avito.ru Moscow office (Lesnaya, 7) on February 27, starting at 12:00.  Unfortunately, the number of seats in the hall is limited, and the BC system has a pass system, so you need to <a href="http://bit.ly/1Tohabr">register</a> and receive confirmation, and take a passport or driver's license with you on the day of the event. <br><br>  If you have questions, it is better to ask them through the form on the registration page on the <a href="http://bit.ly/1Tohabr">Timepad</a> . <br><br>  We are waiting for you at mitap! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/277481/">https://habr.com/ru/post/277481/</a></p>
