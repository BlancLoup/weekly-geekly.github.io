Marketing cases allow you to quickly tell potential consumers about the latest technology and the experience of its successful application to solve specific problems.  In other words, the product or service is demonstrated ‚Äúin action‚Äù.  Thus, the case ‚Äúpushes‚Äù a potential client to make a similar decision in a similar situation. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The marketing case is beneficial for both the technology company and the company that used this technology to solve their business problems. <br><br>  <b>The technology developer case is beneficial in that:</b> <br><br>  - provides journalists with materials for writing articles about the company's product; <br>  - tells potential customers about the use of the product to solve specific problems; <br>  - may trigger interest in unpopular products and services; <br>  - positioning the company as a trustworthy partner with experience and knowledge. <br><br>  <b>The case to the client company is beneficial in that:</b> <br><br>  - presents it as a progressive company that uses innovative technological tools to solve their business problems; <br>  - promotes the company's brand on the developer's website and in the media that published the story. <br><br>  <b>Where can I use the case?</b> <br><br>  1. The case can be used to prepare a press release and follow up in the media. <br>  2. The case can be published on your own website in the ‚ÄúPress Kit‚Äù or ‚ÄúSuccess Stories‚Äù section. <br>  3. Case can be used as illustrative material at conferences and presentations. <br><br>  <b>Length, format and appearance of the case</b> <br><br>  Most marketing cases are written on one or two pages, which is about 500-600 words.  Naturally, you can write more, but it will already look like aggressive advertising.  But the study of cases involves a subtle unobtrusive approach. <br><br>  The format of the case allows the author to experiment and try something new. <br><br>  Write a success story so that it is read.  Take care of your readers' vision.  Use an easy-to-read font.  The best would be Arial, 12-14 size. <br><br>  Be careful with the color scheme.  Wanting to make the case brighter and more expressive, you will do yourself a disservice - the blue letters on a yellow background will be remembered for a long time, but they are unlikely to be liked.  No matter how desirable, it is difficult to come up with something better than the classic ‚Äúblack and white‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>So, the structure of the case</b> <br><br>  Most cases have the following structure: <br><br>  <b>The situation</b> is a kind of ‚Äúproverb‚Äù, an introductory block, which explains the reason that led to the preparation of a marketing case.  Here, in brief, it tells about the client company, its field of activity, position in the market, its size, as well as other details.  Also, in this part, you can explain why the client chose you to solve his problem: the uniqueness of your product, the use of similar technology in the past, your rewards, recognition in the market. <br><br>  <b>The problem</b> is the plot of the story.  It describes the problem that the client encountered.  This can be anything from poor productivity in a company due to poor automation of processes to data loss due to hard disk wear on a home PC. <br><br>  <b>The solution</b> is the main part of the case.  It describes the product that was used to solve the problem and gives the results.  Key points are supported by numbers, tables and graphs. <br><br>  <b>Evaluation</b> - the final part of the marketing case, which sums up what has been said and evaluates the result that was achieved with the help of your product. <br><br>  <b>What should pay attention</b> <br><br>  We have already mentioned that studying a case is an unobtrusive advertisement.  The purpose of this document is to emphasize the benefits of your product, avoiding standard and dry formulations. <br><br>  Mention the benefits of your product in the very title of the case.  Instead of saying ‚ÄúCase study in the bank‚Äù write ‚ÄúSuccess Story: How Product X Increased Productivity Up to 80% in 30 Days‚Äù.  The title should be the quintessence of the case, the most important and only in the case. <br><br>  For greater credibility, it is important to mention the financial side of things.  Tell us how your product paid for itself.  For example, he increased the performance of the client company by 50% in 2 months.  Explain how these results were achieved.  You should not be zealous with exaggeration.  Remember: no one has yet invented a tool for solving all problems, which means that the text, where the product is described as a universal solution, will be considered unreliable and not read to the end. <br><br>  Tell readers how your solution helps reduce costs.  The budget is a delicate topic.  And if you can show how technology has helped the client save money - your reader. <br><br>  <b>What can be done right now?</b> <br><br>  We suggest you to get acquainted with examples of writing marketing cases.  The authors of the cases are copywriters of the respective firms. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/rus/business/smb/">Page with cases of MICROSOFT</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.colasoft.com/capsa/case_study.php">COLASOFT Case Page</a> <br><br>  You can also download our <a href="http://www.ivan-pr.com/ru/files/misc/case-study_brief.doc">case preparation form</a> (DOC, 40 Kb) and write your own success story on your own. <br><br>  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119646/</a></p>
