  <section class="page js-page"><h1>They will plant not only for likes and comments, but also for emoji</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the late 1990s, Japan developed a new language, a mixture of ideograms and emoticons.  Emoji became especially popular after being picked up by smartphone makers.  Today, emoji is almost everywhere, and they are very fond of schoolchildren. <br><br>  For the phrase "Kill.  Meet me at the library, framed by an emoji in the form of a pistol, knife and bomb, the Virginia state police arrested a twelve-year-old girl.  The story began in December 2014, when a high school employee in Fairfax discovered a message on Instagram.  The investigation led to the account owner, who was then charged with threats and harassment via the Internet.  During the proceedings, the schoolgirl's mom said that the girl published this message because of bullying from peers.  School representatives noted that the threat is ‚Äúnot credible.‚Äù <br><br>  The world needs Emoji experts.  Otherwise, who will help the judges translate the sayings of schoolgirls? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6bd/651/635/6bd651635b33913a1a54891e24131fdb.png" width="350" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What will the experts say? </h4><br>  The judge is to determine whether this threat was real, and, if so, what punishment the girl deserves.  And here we need expertise, and not just linguistic.  As in the case of the case of a 17-year-old New Yorker, who unsuccessfully arranged a emoji with a policeman and a picture with three images of a pistol.  The grand jury refused to recognize the teenager guilty.

      In Russia, experts <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269386/">checked emoji in the iPhone</a> in January 2016 at the request of the Russian division of Apple.  Smilies were divided into categories, and then searched for images that could harm the health and development of the child.  Some Emoji experts raised questions, but experts did not see the propaganda and demonstration of smoking in a cigarette, as the image of the person was not, and did not consider the image of alcoholic beverages to be the propaganda of drinking alcohol. <br><br>  By propaganda is understood as ‚Äúthe activity of individuals and (or) legal entities in disseminating information aimed at shaping and creating attitudes and (or) behavioral stereotypes, or having the goal of encouraging or encouraging individuals to whom it is addressed to perform any actions or to abstain from their commission. "  And Emoji is a graphic language based on symbol images.  Therefore, the thought that the user expresses depends on the sequence of characters, Russian experts are sure. <br><br><h4>  Read with expression </h4><br>  Another important question for the judiciary is - can Emoji be considered evidence?  The meaning of correspondence messages that can be used as evidence in a court of law can vary greatly depending on the presence of pictograms in it. <br><br>  The rapper's wife, Elonis, took his texts published on Facebook as threats - because the topic was her murder.  But the court sided with the rapper, because, firstly, it was about art, and, secondly, after some phrases there was a smile with his tongue sticking out: P - proof that this is a joke. <br><br>  But the abbreviation LOL did not save in 2013, eighteen-year-old Justin Carter, who left a comment on Facebook: ‚ÄúYes, I ******* on the head.  I think I will shoot the kindergarten, I will look like innocent blood will flow, and I will eat the beating heart of one of them ‚Äù.  A Canadian resident reported the incident to the police after she found Carter's address and determined that he was living near an elementary school, and the guy first spent a couple of years in prison and then was placed under house arrest.  The accusation is a terrorist threat.  It was necessary to use smiles.  ¬Ø \ _ („ÉÑ) _ / ¬Ø <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aeb/df8/51b/aebdf851b08b8774e1a47a2810b4c505.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  And about why they can still be imprisoned or at least fired from their jobs, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/264534/">read this article</a> .
