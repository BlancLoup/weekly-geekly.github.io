  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Memory secrets</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Memory is a great property, without which it is difficult to imagine human life.  Thanks to memory, we use our own experiences of previous generations in everyday life.  Is there any way to improve it?  What does it depend on? <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Let's try to answer these questions. <br><br><h4>  Short-term and long-term memory </h4><br>  Memory is of two types - short-term, or operational, and long-term.  During the session, students manage to ‚Äúshove‚Äù a huge amount of information into their memory during the night, which disappears immediately after the exam.  Patients with the so-called senile forgetfulness in the smallest details remember the events that occurred in early childhood or many years ago, but are unable to keep in mind what was half an hour ago. <br><br><h4>  Bill Gates remembers hundreds of codes of the programming language created by him. </h4><br>  The memory possibilities are endless.  It is believed that an adult can remember from twenty to one hundred thousand words.  There are people with a phenomenal memory.  Alexander of Macedon remembered the names of all his warriors.  Academician Abram Ioffe knew by heart the entire table of logarithms.  Mozart only needed to hear a piece of music once, in order to play it and write it down on paper.  After listening to Allegri's ‚ÄúMiserere‚Äù (in 9 parts), he managed to memorize the entire score of this work, which was kept secret by the Vatican.  During the second audition, Mozart discovered only a few wrong notes in his recording.  Sergei Rachmaninov also had the same musical memory.  Conductor Arturo Toscanini remembered every note of the 400 scores.  Winston Churchill knew by heart almost all of Shakespeare.  Dominic O'Brien from the UK managed to remember the location of the shuffled cards of one deck in 38 seconds.  Bill Gates remembers hundreds of codes of the programming language created by him.

    <h4>  Man begins to memorize in the womb </h4><br>  According to scientists, the memory of a human fetus begins to work 20 weeks after conception.  During the tests, a beep was sent through the mother‚Äôs stomach, which the fetus could hear;  then, using an ultrasound scanner, the reaction was checked.  It turned out that the embryo responds to noise by slightly moving its body or legs.  True, after the fifth signal, he ‚Äúgot used‚Äù to the repetitive sound and could ignore it.  When the signal was sent again after 10 minutes and even a day later, the embryo easily recognized the familiar sound.  Scientists believe that a person can, in principle, remember what happened to him in the womb. <br><br><h4>  Memory is individual </h4><br>  Many factors affect memory.  Someone better remembers what he saw, someone - that he heard.  In such cases, talking about visual or auditory memory.  The subject of interest is remembered better.  Well-known memory of feelings feelings.  In a state of emotional elevation, things that seem to have long been forgotten are sometimes caused from memory.  Motivation is very important.  A person who considers himself completely incapable of languages, having fallen into a stressful situation in a foreign country, when the question is about physical survival, easily learns the language.  In many ways, the ability to memorize depends on fitness.  British scientists with the help of a special scanner investigated the frontal lobe of the brain, which manages the movement in space, at the taxi drivers and representatives of other professions.  It turned out that it is developed in taxi drivers much more.  Moreover, the better the driver orientates himself in the city, the shorter the way he can travel from one place to another, the larger the frontal lobe of his brain.  At the same time, the volume of gray matter as a whole does not change, it is simply distributed differently. <br><br><h4>  Distraction is not a sign of poor memory </h4><br>  Bad confusion is often confused with bad memory.  But scattered people are really just immersed in their thoughts, their attention is concentrated, but on something else, and they are not interested in household information.  Often, inattention caused by overwork and the consequences of the disease, that is, the state in which the person is at the moment, is taken for memory impairment.  Obstacles prevent memory loss.  This is due to the proximity of the center of smell with the "memory" area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brain.  The acute reaction of memory to smells, apparently, was programmed: the role of smells in the survival of the ancient man was very large. <br><br><h4>  With age, memory does not always deteriorate </h4><br>  Complaints of poor memory are becoming more frequent after 40 years and even more so in old age.  In fact this is not true.  Just at the end of the active study, there is no need to learn something, the skill to strain the memory disappears, and it is ‚Äúdetrained‚Äù.  Actors who have to learn new roles for life, and in old age cope with the longest texts.  Now in some countries, for example, in Germany and the USA, more and more often people, having retired, go to universities (usually to humanitarian faculties), quite successfully study and pass exams along with young classmates. <br><br><h4>  Ability to forget </h4><br>  It is impossible to remember everything.  The ability to forget is of great importance in the survival of people.  The brain must be freed from the unnecessary burden of impressions and information.  Memory regulates the load itself, prepares to receive new information.  At the same time, the old information does not disappear without a trace, but passes from active to passive memory, from which it can sometimes be extracted.  This remarkable property saves many people in tragic situations. <br><br><h4>  Memory can be improved </h4><br>  In most cases, memory can be improved.  Previously it was thought that in an adult human brain cells - neurons - do not divide and gradually die.  But it turned out that it is not.  The results of recent studies suggest that neurons are divided even at 70 years of age.  Moreover, breeding cells found in the most "thinking" parts of the brain.  Now scientists believe that the age-related weakening of memory is associated not so much with the physical death of neurons, as with the disruption of contacts between them.  Substances that help establish such contacts are known.  This is primarily vitamins C, E, B6, B12, beta-carotene, fatty acids contained in salmon, tuna, sardines, herring, extract from the ginkgo biloba plant. <br><br><h4>  Impression, Repetition and Association </h4><br>  The average person uses no more than ten percent of the innate capabilities of his memory.  The remaining ninety percent disappear, because we do not know how to use the natural laws of memorization.  And these laws are very simple.  There are three of them - impression, repetition and association. <br><br>  So you want to remember something.  First, for this you need to concentrate and get an impression, using for this not only sight, but also hearing, smell. <br><br>  The visual impression is the most durable.  After all, the nerves leading from the eye to the brain are twenty times thicker than the nerves leading from the ear to the brain.  Mark Twain could not remember the sequence of his speech when he used the recordings, but when he dropped the recordings and began to use the drawings for memorizing, all his difficulties disappeared. <br><br>  The second law of memory is repetition.  Thousands of Muslim students know the Koran by heart - a book of about the same size as the New Testament.  They manage to memorize it mainly through repetition.  And finally, the third law is associations.  The only way to reliably remember a certain fact is to associate it with any other. <br><br><h4>  Memory training </h4><br><ul><li>  After 5-10 minutes after waking up, count in the reverse order from 100 to 1 as quickly as possible. </li><li>  Repeat the alphabet, coming up with a word for each letter.  If you have forgotten a letter or can‚Äôt think of a word, do not stop.  The pace is important here. </li><li>  Name twenty male names and the same female. </li><li>  Choose any letter of the alphabet and name twenty words beginning with it. </li><li>  Close your eyes and count to twenty. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37093/</a></p>
