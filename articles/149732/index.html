      They have laws that you invented, voluntarily or unwittingly. <br>  And like people, your worlds are born and die. <br><br>  Why am I doing this? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  About tetris </h4><br>  Tetris mentioned in vain was once popular, but we all left it.  The glass is empty and dry. <br>  Remember how many years ago you played it?  But didn‚Äôt you create your own Tetris world in C, Pascal or Javasript in your youth? <br><br>  Everyone was fascinated by the process of filling holes with cubes. <br><br>  As far as comprehending the mastery, the man got fed up.  And I enjoyed it only in the most complex, adrenaline mode. <br>  Survive at maximum speed.  On the glass filled to the brim.  When the rescue is half a second. <br>  Key combinations were born in the brain, which should be pressed almost simultaneously.  And the figure fell into the box intended for her. <br>  In terms of printing speed, tetris players caught up with professional typists.  700 characters per minute. <br><br><h4>  Game process </h4><br>  Okay, let's end with the lyrics.  We formalize the gameplay. <br>  Discarding conventions, there were only 4 buttons in Tetris.  (a) right, (b) left, ¬© turn clockwise, (d) turn counterclockwise. <br>  It is clear that transformations in Tetris, for example, a * c * c = c * a * c = c * c * a are commutative. <br>  That is, the result does not depend on the order of keystrokes. <br><br>  It is in the simple worlds that the equality under permutation is true (commutative law) <br><pre> <code class="perl hljs">a*b = b*a</code> </pre><br>  Tetris world is simple.  I repeat.  That's why everyone abandoned him. <br><br>  The real world is different.  He is complicated.  Although in it, as in Tetris, events A or B occur, changing it. <br><pre> <code class="perl hljs"> W=A*W; W=B*W;</code> </pre><br><br>  It is said that the ancient Greeks called events A and B affine transformations.  I do not know, not sure. <br><br>  So, for affine transformations from the big world A * B is not equal to B * A. <br><br>  Example?  You are welcome. <br><br><pre> <code class="perl hljs">A=<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"      "</span></span> B=<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"    "</span></span></code> </pre><br><br>  Agree that A * B is not at all like B * A. <br>  Moreover, as a result of the rearrangement of two transformations, the resulting world can differ catastrophically. <br><br>  So where did the tetris players go?  In the three-dimensional glass, where else, because CS then was not there. <br>  And in the three-dimensional tetris A * B is not equal to B * A. <br><br><h4>  A little history about the three-dimensional world </h4><br><br>  If I am not mistaken, the three-dimensional Tetris was called BlockOut and was made back in 1990 for a 286 processor. <br>  There are six buttons for rotation in three planes and 8 buttons for movement along two axes X and Y. <br>  The game is eternal. <br>  I know 50-year-olds who bought computers, only to sometimes remember their youth and play BlockOut. <br>  And they play only in one mode.  Glass size 3x3x18.  The depth along the axis Z = 18. A complex set of figures. <br>  A player with 200,000 points is considered a guru. <br>  His three-dimensional thinking is envied by Riemann, Hilbert and AT Fomenko. <br><br>  The game itself has a website, ratings, halls of fame, rules, a scoring system, sets of pieces, and even source code. <br><br>  With the advent of the phone, I wanted to have this childhood game on a mobile device. <br>  The version found in the appStore was downloaded, used and immediately deleted. <br>  A glass of the wrong system.  Management is not for the guru.  Management is terrible. <br><br>  Understand that at fast levels the figure falls to the bottom in 1.1 seconds and the person must have time to do 3-5 consecutive clicks. <br>  And the sequence can not be changed!  And he is offered a multitouch to twist the figure in the XY plane. <br>  On only one multitouch rotation takes almost a second. <br><br>  In short, you have to invent your own. <br><br>  I considered four options and checked 3 of them. <br><br><h4>  Continuation and result in the second part for geeks BL </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149732/</a></p>
