  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Games 1C on "Softula"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Friday, I was again at the " <a href="http://www.softool.ru/">Softula</a> ."  It was the last day of the exhibition, the people were smaller, so it was not necessary to be on duty at all at our stand and there was time to walk around the exhibition itself.  Having visited a couple of information security stands I was interested in (I will write a separate post about this), I could not pass by the central exposition, where <a href="http://games.1c.ru/">1C</a> presented its actual games.  It looked like this: <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/stasetsky/view/13948/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a1/687/7da/4a16877daad094b75ad827900eca63d5.jpg" width="500" height="375" title="1C" alt="1C"></a> <br><br>  As you can see in the photo, there were computers on the 1C stand, where anyone could try the games presented at the exhibition.  What I did.  :-) <a name="habracut"></a>

      The beauty of the shooter " <a href="http://www.games.1c.ru/bioshock/">Bioshok</a> " I somehow did not appreciate.  I understand that all these <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/2255185/%3Ftype%3D4">enthusiastic reviews are</a> not in vain, but somehow not inserted.  Maybe the level was boring (dull corridors, where the opponents are just a few ordinary guards, and the weapon is an ordinary automatic rifle), maybe they were distracted by extraneous sounds of the exhibition around ... Yes, the game is beautiful, but why are there shooters 8 years ago: not every object can be destroyed (a sickly wire fence looks funny, which remains unscathed from a grenade break and thus an insurmountable obstacle for the main character) ... But decided to buy it (the game went on sale for a day  October 5), to play in a relaxed environment. <br><br>  But the ‚Äú <a href="http://games.1c.ru/hummer/">Four-wheel drive 2: HUMMER</a> ‚Äù autosimulator, in honor of which the real ‚ÄúHummer‚Äù car was located at the stand, fascinates immediately.  Excellent graphics - it goes without saying, but the heart naturally stops when the Hummer climbs a mountain ridge a little more than the width of the machine itself.  The appearing inscriptions on the screen look like a mockery: ‚ÄúFine - tape damage‚Äù (protecting the track).  What, what for, a ribbon - here it wouldn‚Äôt be possible to reach the precipice!  :-) At some point, the thought crept in that whether to buy a steering wheel home, too, in order to play in the Hammer.  But, nevertheless, it is not mine - enough of my flight simulators.  :-) <br><br>  As for flight simulators, a couple of computers with excellent multi-functional (stick + separate gas knob) joysticks were given to the spectacular game ‚ÄúLock On: Black Shark‚Äù (strangely, <a href="http://games.1c.ru/%3Ftype%3Dreleases%26letter%3D76%26act%3Dsearch%26game_name%3DL%26genre_id%3D%26date%3D">there is nothing</a> about it on the 1C website).  As the name implies, the player will have to control the legendary Ka-50 Black Shark helicopter.  After my beloved "Il-2 Sturmovik" with its ascetic screw airplanes of the forties, the helicopter cabin with dozens of dials discourages: you do not know what to do, where to look and press.  However, control and navigation are similar to the IL-2, with a sin in half able to rise into the air and attack the target.  The potential of the game feels great, you just have to figure out how to play it in order to fly with pleasure. <br><br>  The Il-2 Attack plane was also presented at the exhibition (a large attack aircraft model hanging under the ceiling is noticeable in the photo), but apparently due to the fact that the <a href="http://games.1c.ru/il-2_platinum/">Platinum Collection</a> was released last year, only one computer was given to the game.  With unprecedented mental anguish, he watched a comrade sitting behind him try to shoot down a bomber from a distance of 2 km (the target firing range of aircraft of that time was on average up to 700 meters).  As soon as he got bored and he decided to release the computer, they called me from our stand and asked me to come over and replace the people who decided to have dinner.  :-) <br><br>  I also saw the strategies ‚Äú <a href="http://games.1c.ru/xiii_century/">XIII century: Glory or death</a> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="http://ww2.games.1c.ru/">World War II</a> ‚Äù.  The toys are very beautiful, but I didn‚Äôt try: you have to deal with strategies slowly and thoughtfully, and in the bustle of a few minutes of the exhibition you can spoil the impression. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14798/</a></p>
