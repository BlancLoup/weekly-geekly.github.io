      <b>How did we come about?</b> <br><br>  We are not ‚Äúone of many‚Äù virtual PBXs.  What we are striving for is to make the product as useful as possible in everything, even in small things.  For example, our service can help reduce the time to set up telephony in the office, and this is a real benefit.  We analyzed the supply and demand and came to the conclusion that existing solutions on the market cannot solve all the problems of our potential customers.  Today, many do not switch to cloud telephony, but continue to use old analog PBXs, the cost of servicing which is several times higher than the cost of virtual services.  The reasons may be different: for some, it is security, for others - limitations in functionality, for others - habit and distrust of cloud services.  Anyway, now we are solving the tasks of each client, adjusting the service for each one as much as possible, and we are not going to stop there. <br><br>  <b>We have already managed to add more services to the basic package.</b>  <b>Already, users can use not only a regular virtual number as a number, as is the case with all our competitors, but also Skype-login or multi-phone - we will tell about this in the next posts.</b>  <b>The next step is the development of applications for mobile platforms.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b3/da5/da8/0b3da5da86b1419291ba6f265d75f1df.jpg"><br><br>  Initially, we thought that users needed a virtual PBX with the ability to connect their numbers, but it turned out that this was not the case.  We also solved the task with numbers pretty cool: we developed our own API, which allows us to take numbering capacities from operators, add them to our pool, sort them into groups, give the user access to them for purchase.  Now, on the basis of this decision, we have enabled our users to choose from more than 14,000 numbers in the codes "495" and "499".  At the queue numbers "8-800." <br><br>  <b>Why is the PBX cloud?</b> <br><br>  Finding an ‚Äúiron‚Äù remotely has a lot of advantages: the equipment does not take up space in the office, there is no need to pull the wires, but the mobility of users increases, because the number can move to any other place.  Setup takes 5 minutes - and you can start working right away, no need to wait for a specialist to leave, etc. <br><br>  <b>If we were users of our services, what would we like?</b> <br><br>  Openness from the operator in terms of prices.  To understand how much the service will cost in the end with the number and all the necessary functions.  We indicate this immediately.  Many people think that to buy a number will be cheap, and then overpay for additional services.  At once everything is clear to us what it costs.  The same applies to room prices.  From the first day we established a policy that the number is only a means of communication, and not a way to earn one-time on a huge margin.  We are for long-term relationships with a client, rather than trying to work on the principle of ‚Äútake a lot and, preferably, immediately.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08b/c07/319/08bc0731987540b7a22e531b0f6daae8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>What else do we want from ourselves?</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://ringcloud.ru/tarif.php">Service.</a>  <a href="http://ringcloud.ru/tarif.php">First-class, excellent and loyal to the customer.</a>  This is the "sore point" of most major providers - the inability to reach the operator, to solve the problem.  We have an excellent customer service and technical support.  Because it is the basis on which the relationship with the client.  You can see for yourself.  How?  For example, we have a clear dialogue with each of them about the need for integration.  Every request we take to work and implement.  Try it! <br><br>  In order to better understand what will be interesting for you, dear readers, in our blog, we offer to take a short survey: </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255201/</a></p>
