      President Trump, by his recent decree, has banned US companies <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/455363/">whose technologies are of state interest</a> to cooperate with Chinese partners.  The first company from China, which had to face the consequences of the decree, was Huawei. <br><br>  Many US companies, including Google, Intel and Microsoft, have broken off with her.  Now it's Facebook.  The social network said it was prohibiting Huawei from pre-installing Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram mobile apps on their Android phones. <br><br>  We are talking only about new smartphones, the owners of Huawei devices purchased earlier may not worry - the applications will be updated.  Among the applications that are pre-installed on Huawei smartphones is also Twitter and Booking.com.  Whether they will remain among those allowed for the preset is unknown. <br><br><h3>  The State Duma may introduce administrative responsibility for mining </h3><br>  The head of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, Anatoly Aksakov, said that the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/455395/">state plans to introduce more stringent measures to combat miners</a> .  The fact is that they do not fit into the state economic system, in addition, miners fall out of the jurisdiction of the Russian state. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll note that actions with cryptocurrency that are not determined by Russian law will be considered illegitimate,‚Äù Askakov said.  - This means that ‚Äúmine‚Äù, it will be forbidden to organize the issue, circulation, creation of exchange points for these instruments.  Administrative liability in the form of a fine will be provided for this.  We believe that cryptocurrencies created on open blockchains - bitcoins, ethers, etc., are not legitimate tools. ‚Äù <br><br>  On March 12 of this year, the State Duma in the third reading approved the law ‚ÄúOn Amendments to Part One, Second and Third of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation‚Äù, which enshrines such a thing as ‚Äúdigital right‚Äù.  It comes into force on October 1 of this year, but for its effective work, the Law ‚ÄúOn Digital Financial Assets‚Äù is also required. <br><br><h3>  The Russian government suggested that Huawei use the Aurora OS instead of Android </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cea/c95/c27/ceac95c27d2f7b6e933f24ffb36a5de4.jpg"><br><br>  Huawei Executive Director Guo Ping discussed with the Minister of Digital Development and Communication of the Russian Federation Konstantin Noskov the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/455672/">possibility of replacing Android in the company's smartphones with the Russian Aurora OS</a> .  If the Chinese agree to the proposal of the Russian side, then Rostelecom and the Russian businessman Grigory Berezkin, who own the developer of the OS Aurora, will be able to establish active cooperation with Huawei. <br><br>  There are two options for cooperation.  The first is the installation on various types of devices of the Chinese company OS Aurora.  It can be used by the Chinese instead of the Android operating system from Google, the embedded services of which will soon become inaccessible for Huawei.  The Bell interlocutor said that China is already testing mobile gadgets with Aurora pre-installed. <br><br>  The second option is the localization of production in the Russian part of Huawei devices.  We are talking about the possible start of joint production of both chips and software. <br><br><h3>  The Federation Council proposes fines for using foreign satellite networks </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d2/1b2/611/2d21b261141da06aba2ced6db8557125.jpg"><br><br>  The Federation Council proposes to consider a draft law on imposing liability for Russian officials, individual entrepreneurs and organizations <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/455780/">for the use of foreign satellite communications networks</a> .  Some sources also mention fines for individuals, but in fact there are no references to this in the text of the amendments to the Administrative Code. <br><br>  On November 2, 2018, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation introduced a draft law ‚ÄúOn Amendments to Article 71 of the Federal Law‚Äú On Communications ‚Äù‚Äù, the amendments of which impose a clear ban on the import into the country of ‚Äúsubscriber terminals of the mobile satellite service and subscriber earth stations in motion and working within fixed satellite service ‚Äùof all telecom operators with the exception of those registered in Russia. <br><br><h3>  A sensor from Australia will help robots navigate robots in difficult conditions </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd5/cea/0f0/cd5cea0f01c9369c5ee5b12aa041c58d.jpg"><br><br>  Engineers at the University of Queensland (Australia) introduced a new type of sensor that <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/455974/">helps robots navigate space</a> .  Its design includes vibrissae, as in animals that capture the movement of air, measure the pressure of air masses, the direction of their movement.  Such a sensor can be used in difficult conditions - for example, smoke and fog. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rYp2lageM5M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Vibrissae are called long and hard hair, which have mechanical sensitivity.  They are a specialized sense organ and perform a tactile function.  With their help, cats feel an obstacle even before physical contact with him, so that they can navigate almost in complete darkness. <br><br><h3>  The State Duma plans to raise the fine for storing personal data of Russians outside Russia to 18 million rubles </h3><br>  The State Duma deputies recently introduced a bill to increase the maximum fine for <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/456052/">non-compliance with the requirements for storing data from Russians in the Russian Federation</a> . <br><br>  For citizens, the fine will be from 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles, for officials - from 200 thousand to 500 thousand, for legal entities - from 2 million to 6 million rubles. <br><br>  In the event that a violation is committed again, the amount of fines is significantly increased: <br><br><ul><li>  from 50 000 to 100 000 ‚ÇΩ for citizens; </li><li>  from 500,000 to 1 million rubles for officials; </li><li>  from 6 million to 18 million rubles for legal entities. </li></ul><br>  ‚ÄúThe developed draft law is aimed at strengthening the measures of administrative responsibility for violations in the field of data processing and information dissemination.  &lt;...&gt; Failure to fulfill the duty to localize databases with personal data poses a threat to the safety of citizens, the functioning of critical information infrastructure, and prevents an effective fight against terrorism and extremism &lt;...&gt;, ‚Äùreads the explanatory note of the draft law. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456148/</a></p>
