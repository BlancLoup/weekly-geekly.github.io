These are ideas that are allowed to float freely, and perhaps their analysis will be interesting, especially against the background of the mass popularity of such activities in recent times. <br><br><blockquote>  When developing the car "Victory" it was planned that the name of the car would be "Homeland".  Upon learning of this, Stalin ironically asked: "Well, how do we have the Motherland?"  Therefore, the name was changed to "Victory". <br>  <em><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0_%2528%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%2529">Wikipedia</a></em> </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Was recorded as ‚Äú <strong>StarDress</strong> .‚Äù </h3><br><img title="house2" src="http://img2.pict.com/35/f3/dd/2173911/0/house2.jpg" alt="house2" width="256" height="341" align="right">  Thoughts to do something similar were visited when flipping through LiveJournal, it became increasingly stumble upon the discussion / mention of Dr. House's things, from the series about which only the infant baby had not heard (although it was probably absorbed with her mother's milk).  Again, on Google, on request, " <a href="http://www.google.com.ua/">House's clothes</a> " take off about 227K thematic pages, and there are still almost 500K pages on " <a href="http://www.google.com.ua/">celebrity clothes</a> ", let's add to this the <a href="http://www.google.com.ua/">fans of Louis Vuitton</a> (300K) from the TV and get a theme that, at least, is very active. (The number of requests through WordStat, including by brands / stars, we look).  In addition, nothing centralized on this issue, except for scattered articles in journals and numerous topics on forums and various communities, no one suggested.  Those.  There are no competitors on the web at the moment of writing, in the foreign segment too. <br><br>  <strong>What we do:</strong> by analogy, say, with flicker, the ability to select the selected item in a photo and leave a comment with a link + user registration.  There we also add global ratings, registration of sellers and stores.

A user who did not understand what kind of shirt and instead of Monton wrote, say, Voronin - will get a minus in the rating, and upon reaching a certain number of minuses the signature will simply be removed.  And next to the block comments to start a discussion. <br><br>  To start, I think a dozen or two will have to find all the same, as well as add virtual users / write comments.  But this is more likely to a specialist in SMO / SMM.  And so, each page with the ‚Äúhero‚Äù is sharpened under thematic low-frequency queries, we add the ability to select a country and begin to count traffic. <br><br>  <strong>Where the money comes from.</strong>  So, we have an interesting audience that, on the one hand, wants to be like a super-doctor (for example) or a politician, cadets, specialties and other popular ones.  On the other hand, to earn (and Central Asia is 18-30 years old) for the original Monton and Louis Vuitton simply because ‚Äúpoprikol‚Äù (not primary needs), especially from the current fin.  situation, be able to God forbid that a certain small percentage, but not zero. <br><br>  And the decision suggests itself in the form of sellers or unoriginal, or very similar things.  For example, if you click on the link ‚Äú3 row, 10th place, Da Market‚Äù, you can see the photo of what the seller offers instead of the original.  And he will be able to offer, respectively, for example, sending a text message for 20 UAH.  to our short number.  Or throwing money on the balance is not important.  Well, as an option, you can sell IPs of those who are actively interested in cadets and other "special forces" to military conscripts during the shortfall season. <br><br>  Total - we take sales, and we do not put it on the phone to storm the reference book of the city numbers and spam base for $ 50, and straight to the market or to shopping centers with statistics in hand.  I exaggerate of course, but there are many options.  Plus from the banners, plus immediately offer (or through partners) to buy discs with the complete collection of the series of the actor and other related.  The rise in any case will begin as soon as the first n-people begin to leave feedback to sellers.  He‚Äôs such a bazaar, someone rushed to someone. <br><br>  <strong>Why not.</strong>  Even despite the rather labor-intensive software and a strong social component (an individual who would be engaged in social networks and PR), all this is online tus with clothing not for our market in its current form, when ordering and paying for clothes online simply does not exist as a species. <br><br>  Ideally, such a project should include online stores with affiliate codes and with a sale of sales get a percentage.  But for now, apart from messing around with sms and the mythical sale of advertising, there is no need to rely on anything else. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77850/</a></p>
