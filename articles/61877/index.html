Perhaps this is because from the point of view of web developers, servlets and JSPs were attached to Java (or maybe simply because Java is not very popular in Java). <br><br>  But there was something to see, there was something to listen to, it was with whom to talk and there was something to poke!  Well, of course, memorable bags, T-shirts and caps =)

      And it was still possible to look at living creators and developers of platforms, technologies, and just interesting people, who personally contributed a lot to the evolution of Java, the Internet, and everything. <br><br>  If you would be interested, you can still hook on a small piece: <br>  <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone">java.sun.com/javaone</a> <br>  and watch videos from the main meetings (http://java.sun.com/javaone/2009/general_sessions.jsp) <br><br>  At the conference, a lot of talk <br>  Cloud platforms (clouds and everything connected with them) <br>  Free &amp; open (open source) <br>  Mobile development (mobiles) <br>  Operating systems and platforms <br>  RIA and scripting (non-poor Internet applications and scripting) <br>  and about the future of Java and its followers <br><br>  You can find out about the fashionability of cloud platforms at such conferences.  "Clouds", symbolizing something big white and fluffy, but not a giant albino rat, are heard almost everywhere.  The concept of replacing data centers with flexible cloud-solutions is discussed in at least two audiences.  This sector is dominated by <br><ul><li>  Amazon EC2 (I did not see their representatives, although there were other guys from Amazon) </li><li>  Google apps </li><li>  Microsoft Azure </li><li>  Sun cloud platform </li></ul><br>  I managed to visit the same lab on Sun Cloud Storage, where I could write a small program myself that handles files on the Sun Cloud Storage (by the way, in terms of an API compatible with Amazon S3). <br><br>  As for the "cloud" benefits for the development of web services and applications, the focus is on <br><ul><li>  flexibility <i>(you want a bun - take it off the shelf),</i> </li><li>  scalability <i>(buns shrink and grow in size on demand)</i> </li><li>  and economy <i>(pay only for the bitten off part of the bun)</i> </li></ul><br><br>  As it turned out, Java is going to meet other programming languages.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci_Machine">Da Vinci Machine</a> project allowed porting other programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãto the Java platform.  It is noteworthy that jRuby is inferior in performance only to the latest version of Ruby 1.9. <br><br>  By the way, if, like me, you think that you need to write too much code in Java to perform simple tasks, try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_(programming_language)">Groovy</a> ! <br><br>  Well, now the fun part! <br><br>  If you think that RIA platforms will always mean Flash, Flex and Silverlight, and Java will be represented only by the old ‚Äúgood‚Äù applets, break off!  This conference announced the release of <b><a href="http://www.javafx.com/">JavaFX 1.2</a></b> . <br><br>  Probably, such a thing deserves a separate article, if only because JavaFX has long rested in the development of the subsoil.  At the conference, she was also given a lot of attention. <br><br>  What is JavaFX in a nutshell without unnecessary terms?  This is a platform (language + what it works on) with the ability to create beautiful graphical applications =) And since it works on the same JVM, you can use all the available Java libraries.  The result is a universal platform for destop, web, hundred, blue-ray players, DVD-players and everything where there is a JVM (I hope in the near future) <br><br>  JavaFX syntax resembles Java, ActionScript ... and for some reason JSON (the declarative format for describing objects painfully resembles it) <br><br>  You can create not only colorful colorful interactive applets on JavaFX, but also absolutely ugly and ugly things that came out during the labs: D Well, it‚Äôs just inconvenient to do graphic things without a visual editor ... but cross platform ... <br><br>  Pavilion <br>  And lastly, in the huge hall were placed points with the representations of the most different eminent and not so offices, the names of which I do not remember, and perhaps not even articulate.  There were also held small seminars, demonstrations, raffles and distribution of freebies.  At the JavaFX stand it was possible to play fun games on a wide variety of devices (gloves, arms, weave, blue-ray player). <br><br>  Adobe showed PixelBender and Flex and BlazeDS interactions with the rest.  In another department, one could try to install openSolaris and get a brand T-shirt and badge (pioneering approach).  And during breaks, you could play Quake and knock on Rockband = D <br><br>  At the Amazon stand you could solve a small puzzle and get a ninja coder figure. <br><br> <code>//   ? <br> int ninja_loop (int num ) { <br> if (num &amp; num-1 == 0) return 0; <br> <br> for (int arc = 1; (num &amp;= num-1); arc++) { <br> // ninjas loop differently <br> } <br> <br> return arc; <br> } <br> <br> //   ,       =)) <br></code> <br><br>  Among all the others was the stand of a certain company that was engaged in the protection of software and other things from copying (DRM and others).  An elderly peasant was on duty near the stand, who clearly missed being lonely. <br><br>  Some predict that this conference was the last due to the recent acquisition of Sun by the Oracle office, with which many speakers did not agree.  But be that as it may, I hope that next year there will be JavaOne 2010 and I will have a reason to write another post. <br><br>  PS: Surprisingly, more than half of the people in labs sat with poppies o_O <br>  There were also public terminals that worked on the cards.  From the Sun Virtual Box you could choose from the download openSolaris, Ubuntu 9.04 or Windows-7. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61877/</a></p>
