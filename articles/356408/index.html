To exclude various manipulations and manipulations, it is necessary to make the vote open.  You vote, for example, on a resource of the type ROI (roi.ru) using your personal electronic key and the result of your choice is published there.  Thus, each voter can be sure that his vote is counted correctly, or rather, it is counted in general. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  2. Personal voting for all legislative initiatives. </h4><br>  Now our interests in the state are represented by popularly elected deputies who put forward legislative initiatives and vote for their adoption.  Before the advent of digital technology, there was no other way, the people needed to nominate one candidate, since  technical ability to collect the opinion of all was not.  Now technologies allow us to express our opinion personally regarding the laws put forward by initiative groups.

      In this case, it would be possible to dissolve the dumas of all levels from the state to the municipal, and to save the funds for the maintenance of all these civil servants to bring to the masses the usefulness and significance of a particular bill. <br><br><h4>  3. Karma for civil servants </h4><br>  Why not make karma similar to many online resources for officials?  He put forward a good idea and most importantly implemented it - get a plus in karma.  He promised a lot and did nothing, said something without thinking, podboshiril on the plane, tarnished his reputation - get a minus in karma.  Got a lot of advantages - increase, minuses - resignation. <br><br><h4>  4. Budget Management </h4><br>  A similar process as in p.2.  A part of the budget (not for secret needs) is virtually distributed among the citizens and we ourselves determine which project or sphere we consider it necessary to spend.  Where to send 2.4 trillion rubles - to the assistance of Rosneft or to Health with Education. <br><br>  Of course, to implement such e-democracy, there must be a highly developed infrastructure, everyone must receive an electronic certificate and be able to use the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù.  But most importantly, there must be political will and corresponding motivation of citizens.  First of all, people must believe that they have a real right to vote, which determines the development of the state, and not a dummy. <br><br>  There is, of course, a resource of the IC, but it receives too little attention from the state, there is no promotion to the masses.  Instead of propaganda news on TV, it would be better to talk about the importance of voting for initiatives. <br>  Maybe this is not done, because the one whose name cannot be called, raised several initiatives, such as a ban on expensive cars for civil servants or ratification of Article 20 of the UN Convention, after which the initiative of civil servants has died out. <br><br>  In any case, the introduction of modern technologies could already significantly change the system of public administration in our country. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356408/</a></p>
