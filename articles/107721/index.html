Xmarks - a truly universal service, with which I have been working since the appearance of its forerunner, has already forgotten how the service was called before renaming.  So, the last few months there were rumors, and quite reasonable, that the service ceases to exist due to lack of funding. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Yes, the advertisements placed on the service pages did not even pay back the cost of renting the servers - after all, the capacity had to be constantly increased as a result of the addition of new users.  As a result, Xmarks management posted on the company's official blog sad news about the imminent closure of the service.  There were two ways of survival: the first is to make the service fully paid, while losing up to 90% of users, the second is to buy the service of a larger company.

      All this time, the company was looking for an investor, and there were several proposals that did not fully satisfy the wishes of the Xmarks management.  The day before yesterday there was a message on the official blog that an investor was found who would finance the service‚Äôs future activities.  However, the cooperation agreement was not signed, and all this was described was somehow vague. <br><br>  And finally, today there was a message that the service was purchased by a yet unnamed company.  By the way, the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/centur/" class="user_link">centur</a> user first noticed this <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/centur/" class="user_link">news</a> , for which he thanks a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/centur/" class="user_link">lot</a> . <br><br>  So, the management service announces the continuation of work in two ways - paid and free.  The conditions of both are not announced yet either, but everything is described in bright colors, so one can hope that the new owners and the service management have found the best option for the development of Xmarks, which will suit both the company owners and the users of the service itself.  The founders of the service emphasize that the new owners are 100% ensured further work, and promise to continue everything in the same spirit. <br><br>  So you can only be glad that you don‚Äôt have to look for something similar to this great service from January of the new year.  We are waiting for further news, let's hope that they will be no less joyful. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://blog.xmarks.com/">blog.xmarks.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107721/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107721/</a></p>
