In <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/edu_2_0/90085/">this</a> post a big discussion broke out, several users in the comments promised to write their notes, and the author of the above topic suggested that I write my topic.  Well‚Ä¶ <br><br>  I must say that I do not quite share the point of view of <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/ssiemens/" class="user_link">ssiemens</a> .  Probably because I work in the specialty, and from the university I have only good memories.  In this post I want to talk about how to study with us and share my thoughts. <br>  In addition to objective assessments in the post will be present: the opinion of the author, his impressions and some personal information.  The author does not guarantee that all conclusions are valid for humanitarian education and for other universities in general.  Also, I apologize in advance for typos and possible errors - corrections can be sent to habraposhta. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Foreword </h3><br>  From grade 8 to grade 11, I studied at the lyceum for boys, all of whose representatives were proud of the high level of teachers and students, with the fact that 100% of students enter universities, most of them go to budget places in universities in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  They were still secretly proud that over the more than 15-year history of the school there were only two medalists in it. <br><br>  At the beginning of grade 11, the question of admission arose.  Moscow and Petersburg, several universities.  As a result, for some reason, I chose the Northern Capital, and specifically St. Petersburg State Polytechnic University (SPbSPU).  The question of whom to go to study was not even initially: except for a computer specialty, nothing was considered.  At school they gave Pascal, and at home they stayed behind Delphi.  First of all I looked at ‚ÄúSoftware‚Äù, then other computer specialties followed in descending order.

      In the Polytechnic, this specialty was taught at the Faculty of Technical Cybernetics (FTC), and specifically at the Department of Information and Control Systems (ICS). <br><br><h3>  Training </h3><br>  Freshmen scored six groups.  One budget group in the specialty ‚ÄúAutomated Information Processing and Management Systems‚Äù and five groups in the specialty ‚ÄúComputer software and automated systems‚Äù: two budget and three contract ones.  A total of over 60 people.  I myself studied on a budget. <br><br>  The curriculum is structured in such a way that in the first year the percentage of special subjects was less than 20, by the fifth year it increased to 100. The number of subjects and pairs starting from the second and third year of study steadily decreased.  Up to the fact that in the fifth year I worked 40 hours a week, normally combining this with study.  But this is the only way we have, in other departments there were more steam. <br><br>  Compared with other good faculties of the faculty (I think that those of the IBKS and KSPT (formerly AIVT)) in the subjects of the specialty "dryuchat" are not so strong, they give more freedom.  LEARN.  And so much who takes - the care of students.  I would say that I rather like this approach, although a little more rigor would not hurt.  As in the conduct of objects, and in relation to the lazy. <br>  From course to course, the number of machines that could be obtained increased. <br><br>  Below I will write in more detail on the courses, how the training took place: lists of subjects (the benefit before getting a diploma I used to write a record book) and what I was doing at that time. <br><br><h4>  1st course </h4><br>  Higher Mathematics (ind.), Physics (ind.), English, algorithmization and structured programming (ind.), Microsoft Office, national history, physical culture.  It is at TSA that most of our group has been closely (and someone for the first time) acquainted with programming.  On the basis of Pascal, we were given the first concepts: programs, procedures, functions.  Then there were the algorithms and the beginning of the PLO. <br>  In the second semester, higher mathematics (ind.), Physics (ind.), Algorithmization and structured programming, English, and physical culture continued.  Object-oriented programming (ind.), Ecology (ind.) And microelectronics and circuitry (ind.) Were added to them.  At the OOP lectures, C was read out and the OOP theory was on, the exercises were pure C. Microelectronics was one of my favorite subjects for all my studies at the university, I always received fives automatically, and even thought that I would link my activities with it. <br><br><h5>  From personal </h5><br>  In the middle of the second semester, I got a job as a tester of 1C configurations for 20 hours a week with a dollar rate per hour.  The hostel quickly taught me to be independent and wanted, among other things, to be financially independent.  As I remember, parents sent 2500 rubles per month and the scholarship was 250 rubles. <br><br><h4>  2nd course </h4><br>  In the third semester, they read and conducted: higher mathematics (ind.), Physics (ind.), Microelectronics and circuitry (ind.), Numerical analysis (ind.), Digital computers, OOP, philosophy, and physical culture.  I shamelessly pissed off numerical analysis, and in OOP I tried to understand C ++, STL and MFC.  Memories of Delphi still lived in me and C ++ did not cause delight then. <br>  In the fourth semester, again was vyshmat (ind.), Numerical analysis and digital computers.  Matmodels (ind.), Discrete mathematics (ind.), Operating systems (ind.), And programming of embedded applications were added to them.  Matmodels were about the same as numerical analysis.  On OS and embedded applications it was necessary to use C ++.  Since I didn‚Äôt like him, these courses passed accordingly: on the OS, they gave me an ‚Äúadvance‚Äù, and labs on the built-in applications made a partner. <br><br><h5>  From personal </h5><br>  At the beginning of the second year I realized that programming made me sick, I didn‚Äôt even want to do simple laboratory work.  With horror I thought what would happen next, why the hell did I come here to study.  There were even thoughts about taking the documents and going to the army. <br><br>  Having worked as a tester for exactly a year, I quit in the middle of the fourth semester, including because of problems with studies.  The session became the apogee: it was necessary to pass 5 exams and 1 test with a grade.  By the end of the session I had 1 passed the exam.  4 supplements and 1 test for 4 days were passed at the supplement.  Naturally about the good grades of speech did not go.  After that, I thought hard about myself and my training.  (Looking ahead, I will say that the fifth semester was estimated to be the best from the first year, and the sixth semester was closed for all fives). <br><br><h4>  3rd year </h4><br>  The third course was the worst.  It seems to be already released matan, and then a new attack. <br>  In the fifth semester, they read: probability theory and random process (copy), control in technical systems (copy), database (copy), programming of distributed systems (and in fact J2ME; copy), theory of algorithms and automata, microelectronics and circuitry, mathematical models, Russian language and speech culture. <br>  All students of the department were concerned only with two questions: how to pass the teverver and the TCB?  From the first exams, the people left with a shaft of twos.  Our group (groups with this number have always been considered "botanical") came out of the first exam on TCB with one triple.  All the rest got bad. <br>  In the sixth semester, teverver continued (more precisely, already as statistical modeling), TCB, TAA (copy), mathematical models and databases, computer system architecture (copy), system analysis and decision making, economics and application and design of microprocessors were added.  I skipped the last course.  A system analysis was read, by the way, by the dean of the faculty, who is also the head of our department. <br><br><h5>  From personal </h5><br>  At the beginning of the third year I realized that it would be necessary to fall in love with myself again in programming and somehow begin to move towards the work in my specialty.  In the middle of the fifth semester I bought Troelsen, and passed the first term in C # on databases (oh, this MDB and OLE-objects!).  In my movement towards the work on the specialty, I got a job in the Motorola R &amp; D project (our department actively cooperates with Motorola).  The project ended in summer, but there was no desire to continue with J2ME. <br><br>  A lecturer who taught the course ‚ÄúDatabases‚Äù in the sixth semester, and several graduate students who conducted laboratory work, worked in the same company.  A fairly large office, many projects, tasks for everyone, including the research plan.  These are the tasks they called for third-year students for summer practice.  I went.  The practice has already been done using C #. <br><br><h4>  4th year </h4><br>  In the seventh semester, system analysis continued (ind.), Stat.  modeling (copy), TCB (copy), expert systems were added (copy), data transfer systems (copy), functional and logic programming, psychology, industrial programming, hardware and network architecture.  Psychology, for my taste, is the most interesting humanitarian subject of all. <br>  In the eighth semester, system analysis, technical means and network architecture (ind.) Remained, and multidimensional information processing systems (ind.), Computer graphics (ind.), Software development technologies (ind.), Programming language theory, life safety, sociology, law. <br><br><h5>  From personal </h5><br>  NIR  This fascinating junior course is an abbreviation.  Research work in which it is assumed that the student is engaged in research and work for his diploma.  We even have a bachelor's and optional, but almost all of them passed it.  I stayed for bachelor with the same person who was in charge of my summer practice.  Programming continued. <br><br><h4>  5th year </h4><br>  Studying at the undergraduate courses and looking at the schedule of the 5th year, we didn‚Äôt believe with our eyes: R &amp; D, R &amp; D, R &amp; D ... and only eight pairs a week in five subjects!  And most couples are Friday-Saturday.  No other department of such a "disgrace" was not. <br><br>  The subjects were the following: organization and production planning (ind.), Verification of requirements (ind.), Methods and means of protecting computer information (ind.), Management of software projects, software reliability (ex.).  In addition to software reliability, all subjects were conducted entirely by young teachers: graduate students and former graduate students.  All of them work in large IT companies.  The lectures told the material literally "from the front."  Looking at them, I felt a keen desire to become specialists like them. <br>  The second semester of the fifth course continued with information protection methods (copy), design and website design (copy), JavaEE (copy) and software development process (copy) were added to them. <br><br><h5>  <i>From personal</i> </h5><br>  At the very beginning of the 5th course (in September) I got settled into the fully adult position of a C # developer (where I still work today) and plunged into industrial programming.  I note that in relation to the work, the courses ‚ÄúManagement of software projects‚Äù, ‚ÄúSoftware development process‚Äù and for general development ‚ÄúOrganization and production planning‚Äù (the old name, by the way) were interesting and useful for me. <br><br><h4>  Diploma </h4><br>  My nauchruk is one of those graduate students who once conducted laboratory work on databases, was a curator in summer practice and conducted a bachelor's degree.  Now he has his own business (you can now use the buzzword ‚Äústart-up‚Äù) and his project - an xml-data storage system.  Within the framework of this system my diploma work was done.  And by the way about what the university gives and what an engineer is.  There was a task, there was a word ‚Äúclustering‚Äù heard from the teacher.  And all - let's go.  The study of literature (including English sources), breaking the head, rewriting many pages of the diploma after the realization of the wrong algorithm.  Writing a diploma gave me valuable experience in terms of independent work, material processing, its structuring and presentation. <br><br>  I was on the defenses of two departments: my own and already mentioned KSPT.  Evaluations on the defenses everywhere set very loyal.  But the difference in the process itself caught my eye.  In our department, the commission was mainly a professor, only a couple of people deal with modern technologies / programming.  Hence the questions to the defenders of a generally general plan (although, of course, this does not make them less literate).  In the neighboring department, where, besides the commission, there are still about 6-8 young teachers and graduate students, besides general questions, a lot of purely technical questions are asked.  From this level of protection becomes higher. <br><br><h3>  The Department </h3><br><h4>  Study </h4><br>  As I mentioned above, the students were treated quite loyally, no one really forced anyone.  Those who didn‚Äôt get it, didn‚Äôt live to see the diploma.  The rest of the list of items seems to me to be very balanced.  Some subjects went under the old (apparently, from the standard of the Ministry of Education) names, in fact, young teachers read something else on them.  And this suggests that the department seeks to move with the times, without waiting for orders from above. <br><br><h4>  Teachers </h4><br>  According to the official website of the department, now there are 58 teachers, including: 8 professors, 27 associate professors, 5 senior teachers, 18 assistants, as well as 12 people of educational support staff.  5 Doctors of Science and 25 Candidates of Sciences. <br><br>  I would say that all our teachers are divided into three categories: <br>  - from the older generation, those who devote more time to teaching and spending at the university; <br>  - from the older generation, those who, in parallel with the extensive teaching, have their own firms or work somewhere; <br>  - from the younger generation, those who lead only in our department one or two pairs, as a rule, on Saturdays, and in most of the time they work to the fullest with IT companies. <br><br>  As far as I know, nobody lives on one university salary. <br><br>  A smaller part of all teachers leads the first two courses, most of them starting from the third year.  Their level varies, as elsewhere.  Someone leads better, someone worse.  Students love someone more, someone less.  None of the teachers can not say something really bad. <br><br><h4>  Material base </h4><br>  Training classes, computer classes, projectors, equipment - everything is present.  In general, all software is up to par.  For 6 years of training computers were updated at least 2 times.  Mathematical packages, Studios, SQL Server - everything works without problems.  Of course, in part, all this is because the department and faculty cooperate with IT-companies.  Partly probably because the Polytech in 2007 won a government grant and some money came to the department. <br><br><h3>  Some statistics </h3><br>  I will illustrate the text with some facts and figures. <br><ul><li>  For all the time of study, no student of our department has bought the exam.  No one.  Neither the "general" teachers (such as Vyshmat, physics), nor the teachers of the department.  Maximum - candy / brandy a couple of times. </li><li>  In the first year at the department there were 6 groups, a little more than 60 people.  The sixth course finished (masters are still finishing) 5 groups, a little more than 40 people.  Including  from my group left two. </li><li>  At the time of graduation 11 people studied in my group.  Now 7 people are engaged in software development, 1 person works as an analyst, 1 deals with web, 1 does not work in his specialty and 1 person does not work.  As you can see, the ‚Äúnet‚Äù percentage of workers in the specialty 7 out of 11, i.e.  about 64%.  In parallel budget groups, the situation is about the same.  In contract groups, it is slightly worse, but 3-4 people from the group in the specialty work exactly, and many people use the web, testing, etc. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Finally </h3><br>  Summarizing all the above, we must admit that I was probably lucky.  I am very grateful to my university, my department and all the teachers from whom I studied (especially those who ‚Äúsnitched‚Äù more). <br><br>  Already received a diploma, I sincerely regret that I myself missed a lot of things.  Himself!  I was given, but I did not take it, you fool!  This applies to study (you probably noticed in the description of the courses), and additional features that are in the university.  And it is very sad that this will not be returned and it is very difficult at least partially to repeat. <br><br>  However, the story does not end there: after defending my diploma, I got into the list of budgetary graduate students.  In the fall, study begins in graduate school, where I am going to delve into the topic of the thesis.  Moreover, if I initially considered graduate school rather as a way to solve the housing problem (which money is actively accumulating), then after working on the diploma I wanted to work on research, and even in addition, I thought about teaching, when in the fifth year I looked at our young teachers .  The idea, as you know, is material: in February I was offered to conduct laboratory classes at the department.  I agreed without hesitation.  As a result, from this semester, we, together with two children, conduct laboratory classes - according to the same databases, in the 3rd course.  And you know, this is interesting to me.  And I will be glad if the department will need my help further, and studying in graduate school on the idea involves conducting classes. <br><br><h3>  Bonus </h3><br>  The higher education system now has several problems from different angles.  I will not discuss issues such as financing, low wages, etc.  Because here, in my opinion, everything is obvious.  I will discuss another problem. <br><br>  In my opinion, higher education has depreciated.  Young people stopped wanting (yes, want; my father once changed his career as a football player to a military academy) to join the army, the level of vocational education fell.  All this led to the fact that there were many universities, increased enrollment of students, incl.  at the expense of contractors.  And many of yesterday‚Äôs schoolchildren are going to get a higher education a) to get rid of the army, b) to get a crust, c) because their parents so much beat them.  It is necessary to reduce the number of universities, and the flow of those who want to study in them. <br><br>  Another point is that many students are unsuccessful in choosing a specialty, or they perceive the teaching system incorrectly. <br>  Some acquaintances are surprised to learn that I chose consciously the specialty myself.  This is a number of times.  Higher education does not imply permanent control over students; we, as adults, are free to choose our own destiny, to take or not to take what we are given, to study or not to study.  Independent work is very important.  This is the second term.  The university provides many non-educational opportunities: these are various contests, conferences, etc.  This is item number three. <br>  If the applicant will pay attention to all these components, it will turn out an excellent student and graduate! <br><br>  Another problem: ‚ÄúThe university does not give us practical skills, we know nothing about new technologies,‚Äù students say.  Indeed, the IT area is a very dynamic area and it is unrealistic to keep up with it in terms of specific technologies for the university.  In my opinion, basic subjects should be conducted without being tied to specific technologies; they should provide a foundation, a basis for thinking.  (I foresee the cries of "Down with Pascal!").  And now, in the fifth year, students should be given as much practical subjects as possible as close as possible to reality.  And here another problem appears: who will lead them?  The influx of new staff in universities for the most part is really sad.  But as for the IT area, it seems to me that everything should be solved quite simply: any specialist can combine the main work with several hours a week spent in the university.  Of course, there are some nuances, like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a chair,‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave work,‚Äù etc.  I have already mentioned the differences on the protection of diplomas in his and the neighboring department.  I will add more.  If we have young teachers just like this: one or two pairs a week, and the rest is work, then in the next department young teachers spend most of their time in the department, and the work goes only as part-time work. <br><br>  Of course, seeing the problems, you can simply state them and sigh, they say, and what can I do.  For the beginning, it would be necessary to tune in to the positive and the desire to participate in solving the problem: <br>  1. Know what you want. <br>  2. Do not wait until everything is given to you ready, take and do it yourself. <br>  3. Start with yourself and get better around. <br>  4. Give part of yourself to others and the world will be better. <br><br>  As the <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/glamcoder/" class="user_link">glamcoder</a> noted in the comment to the previous topic: ‚ÄúThe twig broke easily, but the broom was inflexible.‚Äù Good luck to all! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90184/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90184/</a></p>
