  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beeline vs. Tele2: the choice is not cheating. Personal experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Annotation.</b> <br>  <i>In the free-literary form, the personal experience of using the services of Beeline and Tele2 is outlined.</i>  <i>The author claims to share his joy and light sadness.</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I, sid44sid, being in good health and bright memory, far from hot irons, pistol and stern looks of inveterate mafiosi, write this message on behalf of not just a person, a subscriber and a non-partisan, and sometimes very corrosive consumer who sincerely loves his right to choose. <br>  With tears of emotion, I remember my first mobile phone, the Siemens A35 - if not for the then still blue SIM card of Beeline, it would be suitable only for self-defense ... And then there was another one, with a vibrating alert !!!  And there was Beeline in it too.  I can say, grew up with him - or is he with me?  Every year, seconds and then minutes went up in price, but one thing remained unchanged - cold accuracy of calculations.  Even when I had to call in roaming to tech support (in fact, it was impossible to get through anywhere else), Beeline honestly took everything that was due to him, although the problem could not be resolved. <br>  But how was she tired of the leapfrog of ‚Äúnew‚Äù tariffs, the elementary analysis of which lice discouraged any desire to try them. <br>  Then the Intercom appeared, a quick glance at the prices of which revealed all of them, hopefully involuntary, confusion and intricacy.  The first impression remained the last, even subsequent attempts to consider the options only more strongly convinced of the usual simplicity and availability of Beeline tariffs. <br>  And then I found out about Tony.  <a href="http://www.bryansk.tele2.ru/news_2009.html%3Fmonth%3D7%26news_id%3D1443">Very soon the</a> rest of the gang also tightened up (read and pronounced with love intonation and slight hoarseness - author's note).  And this their ‚Äú1 second - 1 kopeck‚Äù shook something long forgotten and desired (Halyava, please!).  ‚Äú <s>This way is</s> just cheaper‚Äù on the seductive girl's ass stupefied, the envelopes of the social program ‚Äú50 rubles.  monthly for six months ", distributed in batches, intrigued mercilessly.  Experiments are great, I said to myself and connected.  Admittedly, this action took place in our three days - three huge extras in different parts of the city, with a kilometer-long queue for connecting on the social package, a rock concert and the all-motto MTS and Beeline!  Yes, it was enchanting - the girls from Tele2 gathered a bunch of people, and our "heroes" sent a fine company to distribute their SIM cards.  MTS even managed on the second day to arrange his show with the distribution of SIMok and the launch of a balloon (unfortunately, the historical photos from this event fell into Bose, along with a mobile phone).  What to lament about the <a href="http://cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2009/12/28/375083">overpriced calls from Bee to T2</a> - all means are good in agony.  The third day of the theater of the absurd allowed himself to miss - from now on another was concerned: the stability of the receipt of a free fifty kopeks.  This was not the case for all the years of living together with Beeline, it was new, it was unusual. <br>  Meanwhile, Tele2 was facing a serious test for lice: international roaming.  Lice are!  Fatty and bitchy - it was not possible to talk in Crete with the Homeland in September, despite the cordial assurances of sales assistants in the presence of roaming in the visited region.  Even the Directory of the subscriber, prudently taken with him and studied from cover to cover, did not help.  But ‚Äúrescued‚Äù Beeline - 1/7 spent on the ticket fell on roaming (B - 69 rubles / min., T2 - 18 rubles / min).  Well ... I was even touched by the answer of Tele2 support to an angry letter about this - the essence of which, "well, I would like to help, but there is nothing."  :) <br>  In the meantime, the cost of mobile communication (yes, taking into account the balance on roaming) has been reduced by 90 percent, which is good news.  In addition, I had a great opportunity, using two SIM cards at the same time, to compare the quality of the services provided almost thoroughly.  The first thing that caught my eye was that on Tele2 I finally had a normal GPRS earned !!!  Jimm connected instantly, worked without failures while traveling around the city, if I forgot to turn it off;  conspicuous consumption on the balance was not observed ( <a href="http://bryansk.tele2.ru/data_services.html">rounding to 1 KB</a> after all).  Normal per-second billing without a marketer's tax for the first minute inspired confidence. <br>  By the way, if you compare it with the same CenterTelecom, which until recently (it was transferred to the base rate), you had to pay almost nothing (in a month and did not pronounce 100 minutes) for almost 350 rub.  - the difference with other advantages and opportunities is enormous.  If he had been framed for me, he would never have fallen into the stereotypes of the past century, would have turned off without even hiccupping - this is pardon, robbery in broad daylight. <br>  Both operators lost the recovery of the lost SIM-cards together with the phone to ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù.  It is nice that there are some services whose basic quality level satisfies completely regardless of the positioning of the company in the market. <br>  Roaming Tele2 in Moscow also did not cause any complaints, mainly due to the accumulated due to cheap local call amounts on the balance (especially provided by Beeline). <br>  But here is bad luck.  Somehow I came across the service ‚Äú <a href="">Number to choose</a> ‚Äù on Beeline.  Oddly enough, it immediately seemed that this was not enough for a long time.  I was amazed at the simplicity, availability, and speed of its rendering (kowtow to the people who created it this way).  I especially liked that for 100 p.  I managed to dig out a number that any IT person would envy: 89000404 (there are small joys in the world).  :) However, I had 2 SIM cards in my hands - this allows me to set up the ‚Äú <a href="">Easy Step to Beeline</a> ‚Äù service, without which the aforementioned one no longer seems so cool.  The operation took about 20 minutes, without having to go anywhere, etc., etc.  Only one thing was frustrating - the possibility of saving the number when changing the operator has not yet been implemented, and to boast about a new number with a call cost of ~ 2.75 rubles per minute versus 0.60 rubles per minute somehow, to put it mildly, did not smile.  Well, let's leave this beauty to the incoming ones, since they are free for now, and we will try to make a similar focus in Tele2. <br>  The ‚Äú <a href="http://www.bryansk.shop.tele2.ru/">new number</a> ‚Äù differs greatly, and not for the better.  The worst thing is to understand this will be enough for a couple of clicks, especially if you have something to compare with.  I‚Äôm writing to support (carefully! English humor): ‚Äúwrite, die - haachu number like Timati‚Äôs‚Äù.  :) The answer within the meaning was the same as the one with the roaming problem, even though I tried to hint unequivocally that I was ready for an individual approach in realizing my desire. <br>  It's good that miracles happen not only on the new year.  Less than six months later, as I come, I confess, a letter that was not at all expected (which is triple nice), say, visit our online store, a surprise is waiting for you there.  Indeed, here it is, dear: 890404!  True, it costs 250 rubles.  (95 of them go to the account), but if you remember that in the first six months I am 300 rubles.  just from this company was presented ... <br>  Without departing from the Internet, I place an order with self-pickup (so impatient), order confirmation came in a ten-minute mail check interval.  I went to the office, got it, set up a call forwarding from the old one (at the same time I transferred the balance to the new one), connected the necessary services, bonuses - satisfied, pacified, grateful and inspired by this essay. <br><br>  <b>Summary.</b> <br>  1. Three whales of cellular communication are good, especially when roaming, and if you can afford them (for a number of reasons, including attachment to a number). <br>  2. Discounter is especially good for local communication, and in the period of entering the market - fly, cheaper! <br>  3. The quality of communication at discounter is quite acceptable, whales also have problem areas. <br>  4. After six months of using Tele2 in quite diverse conditions and situations, being able to compare with Beeline, it remains well worth it to remain in a favorable opinion. <br>  5. And these leaflets are very captivating: <a href="http://www.ru.tele2.ru/customers/low_prices.html">www.ru.tele2.ru/customers/low_prices.html</a> - this is very close and underlines an efficient and modern approach to business organization, which means that it will have a future. <br>  6. Dynamically developing along with the market, the consumer influences it: after all, demand must determine supply, and not vice versa. </div>
