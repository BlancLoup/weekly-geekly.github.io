My name is Alexey Glazkov, I am the ideologist of co-working in Yekaterinburg and the organizer of the <a href="http://www.effman.ru/coworking/">co-working club ‚ÄúTower‚Äù</a> .  If you allow, then I will lead the story on my behalf. <br><br>  Pitertsy, attention!  :) <br><br>  As planned, from July 6 to July 12, my wife and I spent in St. Petersburg.  Before that, I warned all the local coworkers who I knew would try to meet and exchange experiences.  3 people responded.  All 3 meetings turned out, and the result of the trip was, IMHO, more significant than I expected.

      <b>Active co-working offices</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  During my stay, I managed to meet with 3 of the most interesting coworking enthusiasts in St. Petersburg.  Meet and remember them: <br><br>  <b>Boris Umitbaev, ‚ÄúStartUp Place‚Äù (+7 911 936-04-44)</b> <br>  <a href="http://office.munga.ru/startupplace/info">office.munga.ru/startupplace/info</a> <br>  <a href="http://startupplace.ru/">startupplace.ru</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d5c/306/97d/d5c30697d1771b4546d11adba742d1cc.jpg" alt="one"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b00/608/b61/b00608b6117cb33fee7db11fa5b9d09c.jpg" alt="2"><br><br>  Boris is an Internet business entrepreneur.  At some point, his team needed a permanent place for gathering and work - and co-working successfully turned up, allowing cheaply to rent a good large room.  Naturally, for Boris this is not a business. <br><br>  The place is honestly excellent.  Very close by is the metro (for Peter this is critical), cafes, a park zone.  In the office there are comfortable tables and chairs, office equipment, personal lockers, a cooler with delicious water, telephones, oh * itelny Internet at 16 Mbit / s.  Part of the room is separated under the negotiation.  In the next office a team of lawyers, if that - instantly help. <br><br>  Cost - 4000 p / month.  Only 12 places, while there seems to be free. <br><br>  Of the minuses - the wall decoration is not fully completed, there is no place to put sofas, and round-the-clock access is not yet possible.  But this is not very critical.  In general, let's all go to Boris! <br><br>  <b>Evgeny Borayev, ‚ÄúUnionStars‚Äù (+7 904 339-57-55)</b> <br>  <a href="http://office.munga.ru/union_stars">office.munga.ru/union_stars</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c6/ac0/2a0/8c6ac02a0c9b3ca42c4a2178f3709532.jpg" width="200" alt="one"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb6/16b/25c/cb616b25c19dae4b5e48bedac5591c69.jpg" width="200" alt="2"><br><br>  Eugene - web developer.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãco-working took him a long time ago, especially the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãvirtual co-working, which would allow to unite all offices in the CIS into one more or less solid structure.  Now ‚ÄúUnionStars‚Äù is in the process of selecting the new premises, since the former will need to be released by September. <br><br>  When the premises are found (I think this is a matter of a few weeks), Eugene will restore the former structure there: free atmosphere, comfortable workplaces, Internet from 4 Mbit / s, all other services like office equipment, kitchen and other things. <br><br>  It is assumed the presence of 10-20 seats., Costing 4000 p / month.  And if you help Eugene now - there will be no cons in the office at all!  This is the main advantage of active participation in the creation of coworking: there is an opportunity to do everything exactly as you want. <br><br>  <b>Evgeny Matrosov, entrepreneur (+7 921 949-08-85)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/595/f4a/c71/595f4ac711ff983e7d4e04508ca31c0b.jpg" width="200" alt="one"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a84/e98/a7d/a84e98a7d1e26ef2e35d1331b90bdcb2.jpg" width="200" alt="2"><br><br>  Eugene - the owner of his own room, who likes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãco-working.  Do you understand what this means?  That's right: the cost of renting a place can be extremely low, walls and floors can be painted / covered as you please, workplaces can also be arranged and decorated for every taste ... And also - free 24-hour access, own kitchen / toilet / shower, internet from 4 Mbit / s and many other goodies. <br><br>  A minimal repair has already been done in the room: you can work there, but there is still room for creativity.  Nearby there is a subway (5-10 min walk), cafes, parks.  Another plus: literally in the next entrance there is a district police station, where Yevgeny used to work as an investigator.  So you can forget about security issues. <br><br>  I hope that in St. Petersburg there will be a person who takes the opportunity and grabs this opportunity - like we used to be.  The cost of space for this room will be a maximum of 4000 p / month, and in total 20 people can work comfortably here. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  In general, in St. Petersburg there is a choice.  Take the place of Boris - and immediately for the work, without being distracted by non-core problems.  Or - help Eugene, if not afraid to spend a bit of time, but then set everything up completely by yourself.  Well, if you really want absolute freedom - raise your own coworking center <s>, with blackjack and other things</s> ! <br><br>  You also have an office, and I missed you?  Well, either you didn‚Äôt shine on Habr√©, Munge and the Internet in general (then write, I‚Äôll add you to the article), or you have a place more expensive than 5000 tr (IMHO, this is not coworking, so it‚Äôs not interesting to me). <br><br>  <b>Perspectives of coworking in St. Petersburg</b> <br><br>  Purely subjective, it seemed to me that the St. Petersburg people were rather inert, compared to the same Ekb.  But this is a good inertia, from the category of ‚Äúhurry slowly,‚Äù when it is not speed that is put at the forefront, but accuracy of the execution of the plan.  I think the specifics of the travel industry have an effect: foreign tourists bring a significant income to Peter, so all important things have to be done with intelligence, attentiveness and, undoubtedly, beauty. <br><br>  I must say that I tried to travel around the suburbs, to rummage around the entrances and courtyards.  In the historical center, of course, much is hidden from view.  Well, everything is also clear here: courtyards, wells, the cost of housing / office with a view of the Neva is 2-3 times more than without it, there are practically no normal grocery stores, but a huge abundance of cafes, pharmacies and souvenir shops.  Prices are on average 20-30% more than in Ekb.  All this also needs to be taken into account. <br><br>  I think I will not be mistaken if I say this: <br><br>  1) <i>coworking has a great potential in St. Petersburg, but the approach ‚Äúfor the sake of money‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work here either</i> : the cultural capital is still not accustomed to profit from ‚Äúits own‚Äù St. Petersburg people (there are tourists for that) <br>  2) the <i>co-working office can be on any outskirts, if there is a metro station nearby</i> : in St. Petersburg it is an extremely convenient type of transport, unlike Ekb or Msk <br>  3) <i>there must also be a park, a canal, a fountain or all of it at once somewhere</i> : in such a beautiful city it‚Äôs just silly to sit in a dirty and boring place <br>  4) <i>ideal kovorkery for St. Petersburg - probably IT-shnik</i> : in St. Petersburg are concentrated the best brains of Russia (seriously) <br>  5) the <i>cost of renting a place is no more than 5,000 p / month</i> : the crisis has greatly affected the price of St. Petersburg real estate, it is possible to keep within it, and even bread and butter remain <br>  6) <i>do not need to save on the Internet</i> : 4Mbps / 270r., 10Mbps / 400r.  - pi * dec what kopecks compared to 1Mbps / 600r.  in Ekb <br>  7) <i>there must be round-the-clock access, several sofas, a kitchen, a shower, a toilet</i> : if you save those living ‚Äúon the other side‚Äù of the Neva from thinking about the separation of bridges, this will have a good effect on common karma <br>  8) the <i>best directions of NOT IT business for start-up entrepreneurs</i> - HoReCa, production and sale of souvenirs, any art crafts, small b2b services (IMHO of course, you can see here in a week) <br><br>  Something like this. <br><br>  Next in line is Tolyatti and ... China. <br><br>  <b>Do coworking guys.</b>  <b>Let's pick up the crisis together!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64996/</a></p>
