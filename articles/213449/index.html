</pre><br><br>  Paradox.  Every day we are in our company more and more immersed in Internet marketing.  Nevertheless, I agree with Lebedev in the thesis of the epigraph.  There is nothing solid and solid there.  In what we dive - it is not clear.  A bit of psychology, a bit of analytics, a bit of web technology - such a thin soup.  Pour on the head - not stuck in the hair.  On sensible education does not pull.  If a person says ‚ÄúI am a marketer by education‚Äù, immediately there is a feeling of a paid university from a gate and inappropriate ponts.  And letters predictably do not have enough commas, but many pseudo-business phrases like ‚Äúpanton dollar‚Äù, ‚Äúneed to make brief‚Äù and ‚Äúdrop your options, we will look with the manual‚Äù.

      Observations on marketers in customer companies show that in 95% of cases this is a pretty maid / mademoiselle / madam, whose main function is to spend the boss money nicely.  If necessary, the same individual pours coffee to the boss, personally draws Christmas snowflakes in Photoshop and organizes corporate events.  In a financial crisis, the first impulse is to fire.  And not to find another and raise incomes, but to save her salary.  No one would even think to ask the marketer ‚Äúwhere is fame, sales, reputation?‚Äù.  Why they took - it is not clear why they were fired - they do not remember. <br><br>  These are 95% of marketers.  The remaining 5% is when a mature professional tries to do business, digs his nose, thinks with his head and works for the result.  The sadness is that the boss habitually waits for pouring coffee, photoshop snowflakes and female functions even from big men.  Because bosses are also usually not a gift. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Cases when the intelligible boss got an intelligible marketer - fewer than fingers.  Each such we remember and pass on the tales of them to future generations. <br><br>  In general, just that - the marketer changes jobs (or work changes his marketer).  The flow is fantastic.  One of our employees began to understand marketing after the number of clients marketers dismissed under it exceeded the second ten. <br><br>  In short, there is no marketing.  There is an understanding of the product and the market, there is an outlook, own brains, healthy adventurism and technology. <br><br>  Paying tribute to our sworn friends - stupid marketers - get down to business. <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¶ it's a pity </h4><br><pre>                                                     Big mistake manager -

</pre><br><br>  What a marketer does in life is poorly understood.  He usually comes to us with the desire to make a website.  And the main thing about which there is a conversation after the price tag - what should be the structure and main page of the site? <br><br>  How much they say about it - they argue so much.  Someone in a fit of narcissism loves the illustration in the whole cap, someone steals the design and structure from the main competitor, someone sits and stubbornly draws the site structure of 100,500 points with the names in 2 sentences, and then writes a boring content that is not read even employees. <br><br>  It seems that no one around thinks why the site is needed, how it will work, what people will think if they go to the main page and whether they will go further. <br>  And when the site is finally ready, the customer‚Äôs management is so tired of waiting for the result, and the developer‚Äôs employees are from the infinity of the process, that ask yourself the question ‚Äúand what happened?‚Äù There is no courage, no desire, no ability. <br><br>  The problem is especially acute when the so-called ‚Äúcorporate website‚Äù is being made.  With online stores or landing pages of individual products, there are few problems.  Everything is structural, constructive, stable and generally understandable. <br><br>  And when the task is to tell about the next ‚ÄúTyazhpromzheldormashstroy‚Äù or ‚ÄúKvadrapups Entertainment‚Äù which they are cool, how many years they have been on the market and what degree of solidity they emit - everything becomes very sad. <br><br>  The problem is on both sides of the development process. <br>  The developer does not know what is good and what is bad, and therefore does not have any clear arguments in favor of his view.  And the customer, being in an ideological vacuum, does not know what to demand.  There are a lot of non-directional women in it, and in the end the need for self-admiration and public relations of the greatness of the company wins.  As Pelevin described, the client has a full identification with his brand, and you need to repaint his logo and say that they are terrible: the logo, the brand and the business itself. <br><br>  And sometimes a slight unshaven owner on the main page - not the greatest evil.  It is just everyone knows and understands what is behind it, in contrast to the forced main page, where the secondary graphics are adjacent to a bad slogan, a napkin logo and texts about a dynamically developing team of professionals. <br><br>  In general, in terms of inventing the goals, objectives, structure and content of sites is usually a complete vacuum.  Who does what much, and the result is sad. <br><br>  But if marketing had already been invented, and people knew how to use it, the answer could have been found quickly and without much controversy. <br><br><h4>  All as the doctor ordered. <br></h4><br><h5>  SWOT - Plan - Positioning - USP - MindMap - Map - Content </h5><br><br><pre>                                                     Once upon a time there were mice and they were all offended. 
                                                     They went to a wise owl and said: 

                                                     - Owl, help with advice.  All hurt us, 
                                                     cats, foxes, people with mousetraps.  What should we do? 

                                                     Owl thought and said: 
                                                     - And you become hedgehogs.  Do hedgehogs needles, 
                                                     nobody offends them, and people like them. 

                                                     Mice overjoyed and ran home. 
                                                     But on the way, one mouse said: 

                                                      - How do we become hedgehogs?  - and everyone ran 
                                                     back to ask this question wise owl. 
                                                     And the owl replied: 

                                                     - Guys, you do not ship me nonsense. 
                                                     I do strategy.

</pre><br><br>  We have been thinking about this topic ‚Äú... dtsy‚Äù for the last years.  Options went over - a million.  And come up with. <br><br>  We have the technology to create the structure of corporate sites. <br><br>  All repeat the mantra ‚Äúsites for people‚Äù, ‚Äúunique useful texts‚Äù, ‚Äúinternal optimization‚Äù, ‚Äúreference connectivity‚Äù and the like. <br><br>  The web developer community is full of individuals, where everyone is a guru, and the steeper, the louder he waters the others. <br>  Do not believe?  Check it out. <br><br>  Ask the designer what a good site is.  Then ask the advertiser, then ask the technologist (especially I recommend a survey of people obsessed with client optimization, their grass is caustic).  In principle, everything will become clear after talking with the designer, but you can continue. <br><br>  <b>Want to know the truth?</b>  The old, gray and very sad project manager will tell you the truth. <br><br>  What is a good site is determined by the place of your enterprise in the market, the maturity of the company and the competition, on the characteristics of your business.  So immediately, offhand, no one knows the answer, and you can get it by going quite a long way. <br><br>  You can make a good website only by thoroughly immersing yourself in the business of the customer company and starting to feel it.  Of course, the company is well felt by its employees and especially managers, but they usually have two big drawbacks: <br><ol><li>  they cannot analyze themselves (they know too much and are too involved emotionally), </li><li>  they don't understand anything in web development. </li></ol><br>  Any business has too much information about itself, which can theoretically be told on the site.  Usually this information is ‚Äúspread‚Äù over the heads of employees and managers.  Her ‚Äúcrystalline‚Äù form can occasionally be found in some booklets that have been collected with difficulty for the jubilee. <br>  Another paradox: I want to tell so much, the company exists for so long, but as you throw yourself there is nothing in the finished form. <br><br>  <b>What to do?</b> <br>  A few principles: <ol><li>  no need to tell everything.  don't even try </li><li>  what you want people to find and what you want to show them is not the same thing </li><li>  formulate the purpose of creating the site and its place in the chain of work with the client before you prepare the content </li></ol><br><br>  The structure of the company's website should disclose UTP = a unique selling proposition that makes business to visitors of its website.  When we started to do this for ourselves and our clients, it turned out that the majority of customers' managers are completely unprepared to formulate the site's UTP and positioning business. <br>  Moreover, they began to ask us to do this for the customer on our own. <br>  The question is: what should our company write on its website, what information to publish, what to strive for and how.  ‚ÄúFormulate the goals, objectives and structure of our site.‚Äù  At first glance, it is strange: to ask the contractor to do such a basic, fundamental matter as setting goals and developing a structure.  On the other hand, it is better this way than to decide ‚Äúdo it yourself with a mustache‚Äù and make ‚Äúanyhow how‚Äù. <br><br>  If you are ready to formulate a UTP of your site (for example, ‚ÄúOur company is an experienced designer and general contractor of industrial ventilation systems‚Äù), then you already have half the success. <br>  How to get the second half - look at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmvF1gGuiK68">video from the seminar, where I talked about it</a> . <br><br>  But if you yourself cannot formulate in one sentence what idea you want to convey with your site, then this article is for you. <br><br>  To develop UTP and then make the structure of the site, you need to go through 7 steps.  Every step is a question.  The answer to each question should fit on 1 A4 sheet. <br>  These are hard questions.  You will need many hours to get an answer for each.  Sometimes you will immediately give a suitable answer.  Rejoice.  This means that you are very lucky. <br><br><h5>  Step 1. SWOT analysis </h5><br><br>  Yes, yes, this is it.  You remember something about him from the institute course.  There was a square with letters. <br>  That's about these little letters and talk. <br>  You need to choose 2-4 points for each group: <br><ol><li>  strengths </li><li>  opportunities </li><li>  weak sides </li><li>  threats </li></ol><br><br>  At the same time, it is necessary to analyze not the business inland, but only the visible, surface part.  If the strength and the main opportunity of your business is a dad who works in the Administration of something very large, you might be envied, but you don‚Äôt need to write this on the website.  And maybe the site is not necessary. <br><br>  The main point that you should be interested in - strengths.  It is about them you will mainly talk.  Weaknesses, threats and opportunities are needed in order to prioritize. <br><br>  For each item in the Strengths section, you need to understand whether you can disclose it on the site and how you will do it. <br>  An example for company A, which designs and installs industrial ventilation systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/16f/632/437/16f632437b0e7e65374029756ecb6788.png"><br><br><h5>  Step 2. Analysis of pairs and drawing up a plan <br></h5><br>  What strengths need to be used to get a return on opportunities in the external environment <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ce/4a1/3b3/7ce4a13b3e92f09173a21b3c186ca91f.png"><br><br>  What weaknesses need to be eliminated to try to prevent an impending threat? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c3/fa9/6e7/4c3fa96e723bd5078aa42ac2cdddac26.png"><br><br>  What forces must organizations use to eliminate threats? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8d/4a0/d98/b8d4a0d98f819998cc6730ece26f3a34.png"><br><br>  Due to what opportunities of the external environment can the organization overcome existing weaknesses <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41e/f45/5f3/41ef455f3d833e361114338a6b4c81a5.png"><br><br>  There are no instructions here.  Turn on your own brains and think how the company will defeat competitors. <br><br><h5>  Step 3. Unique selling proposition and marketing message of the site <br></h5><br>  Generally speaking, it is good to have a UTP = unique selling proposition. <br>  For example: <br><ul><li>  melting in the mouth and not in the hands </li><li>  better for a man not </li><li>  ... or we will refund your money </li><li>  compare by the way: ‚ÄúFrutonyan - help to mother‚Äù and ‚Äúfor the health of the baby - a-gu-sha‚Äù </li><li>  and so on </li></ul><br><br>  But most ordinary, regular businesses can not come up with such a thing or they get a KG. <br>  Therefore, to solve the problem of designing a site, it is better to use not a UTP, but a marketing message.  When one phrase says it all. <br><br>  Example (dull but working): <br>  <b>Our company is an experienced designer and general contractor of industrial ventilation systems.</b> <br><br><h5>  Step 5. MindMap and sitemap </h5><br><br>  Then everything is simple and technologically.  Take the marketing message and break it apart.  Each part is broken down into elementary theses, which are easy to prove by the invoice that you have. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d5/727/798/5d57277981ae7a3f5f45edf4eb5c8e60.png"><br><br>  After you get this MindMap, you need to make a site structure out of it.  You start to think about what kind of content you have, whether it ‚Äúclimbs‚Äù into the site and form a sitemap using a map of thoughts.  They do not completely coincide.  Most often, the site map is less beautiful and more detailed.  The main thing is to preserve logic and meaning. <br><br><h5>  Step 6. Content plan </h5><br><br>  You need to write all the content.  Of course, it will not be immediately ready.  Therefore, before giving the map to the implementation, make a plan for writing content.  Make sure you know who will write what and when on each page. <br><br>  If within 1 week you could not find the person in charge, remove the page from the map, there will be no content. <br><br><h5>  Is someone doing this? </h5><br><br>  Yes, they do.  This idea was given to us by a good business consultant who does this to his clients.  We in our company use this scheme when they pay for it. <br><br>  It turns out long, expensive, but good.  And I have to do this as the general director with the general director of the customer.  And it is very hard. <br><br>  It is bad that usually all these questions are simply skipped, immediately starting with "news, promotions, about the company, contacts." <br><br><h4>  Conclusions or "no prophet in his own country" <br></h4><br><pre>                                                     A shepherd grazes a flock of sheep on the side of the road.
                                                     Nearby brakes a brand new jeep. 
                                                     From the jeep comes a young man in good 
                                                     a suit, shoes, glasses and a tie, 
                                                     and asks the shepherd: 
                                                     "Come on, if I tell you how many sheep you have in the herd, 
                                                     will you give me one? " 

                                                     The shepherd thought and agreed.

                                                     A young man parks his car, 
                                                     connects netbook 
                                                     and a mobile phone, goes to the NASA site, scans 
                                                     picture pasture via GPS, 
                                                     opens the base in Excel, prints 
                                                     150-page report on a cool mini-printer. 

                                                     Then turns to the shepherd and says: 
                                                     "You have exactly 1568 sheep here."
                                                     The shepherd confirms: "Exactly." 

                                                     The young man takes one and loads it in the trunk. 
                                                     Here the shepherd says: 
                                                     "Come on, I guess who you work for 
                                                     Will you return my sheep for this? " 
                                                     ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù the young man agrees.
