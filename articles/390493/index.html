Inspiring and impressive photo project Falklands / Malvinas: One War, all Wars was the one hundred thousandth Kickstarter project that successfully collected the stated amount.

It still takes considerable courage to take a chance and try to create something completely new.  But today, creativity is encouraged as never before.  To mark this important milestone, we selected 100 facts, which are measured in numbers and related to the first 100,000 successful projects on Kickstarter.
