      The first scheme of the system, we sketched on a piece of paper.  What was symbolic, because the project received the working title ‚ÄúEnvelope‚Äù: the Facebook ribbon looks like an endless set of sheets, and we packed this data into a new form - a kind of envelope for selected information from the page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/317/959/3ce/3179593ce0294e2d8af694d86f20b2a3.png"><br><br>  Let's first get acquainted with the concept of our ‚Äúblack box‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  1. How it works </h2><br>  The user enters the <a href="https://ukit.com/ru/convert">service</a> from a PC, smartphone or tablet, gives a link to a page on the social network and selects a template for the future site.  Then everything happens automatically - just watch the timer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a8/7c7/5b2/1a87c75b20534d3eb53bc01b04e248ac.png"><br><br>  While the timer is ticking, we take the data from the Facebook API page, add it to a single file on our server and create an image of the future business card site using our own <a href="http://blog-ru.ukit.com/updates/backup">backup system</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36b/cfc/c20/36bcfcc2050f4cea83b8a6b930012999.jpg"><br>  <a href="">Full size picture</a> <br><br>  <b>The main page</b> is shaped according to the principle of landing: a bright first screen, then beautiful photos, below are the texts of recent posts for which we will automatically create headlines.  If there were upcoming events on Facebook, you can sign up with the main one.  Any reviews?  We will also post them on the site‚Äôs ‚Äúface‚Äù. <br><br>  The number of internal pages depends on the page on the FB.  The minimum set that you will receive: the main and individual pages ‚ÄúGallery‚Äù and ‚ÄúNews‚Äù - they will store more photos and posts (up to 50 pieces) than on the main one.  The site structure also includes the ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù, ‚ÄúAbout us‚Äù and ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù pages, which we will generate only if there is enough data on Facebook for this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc8/a50/e63/cc8a50e6395b4a1ba6c2bd1a9622d600.jpg"><br>  <a href="">Full size picture</a> <br><br>  Each useful data unit during the transfer is ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù into a widget from uKit - a ready-made element (title, text block, map, etc.) from the designer, in which the user will manage his site.  However, we not only decompose data from Facebook in our own way, but also add elements specific to the site (call-to-action buttons, feedback form, etc.) and prescribe the first SEO settings for the user. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ba/d41/362/8bad413626004e50b3df67207aad3d9b.png"></a> <br><br>  When the import is completed, the user proceeds to view the result - and then can add to and modify the prototype (for example, put the store widget, callback, etc.) in a visual mode. <br><br>  The whole process from the start of the import to the moment ‚Äúedit the site with your hands‚Äù takes about two minutes. <br><br><h2>  2. Where to see the result? </h2><br>  <b>1)</b> If you do not have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/217671661585622%3Fsr%3D6%26query%3D%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2520%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0%26sid%3D05EAK8OraUANUnbrf">public</a> Facebook page, look at the <a href="http://velosekta.com/">website of cyclists from ENEA</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d31/b1f/1d6/d31b1f1d69c34d899022828a8516135f.png"><br><br>  It underwent a minimum of changes after import and is most obvious as an example of what can be obtained at the output. <br><br>  <b>2)</b> Other users do not stop and add more widgets to the site, in their own way reworking the structure of the main and inner pages - for example, like this cafe from Serpukhov.  The guys made their own site for the first time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef2/aa9/f9e/ef2aa9f9e13d47c1b1522e2ff5672ee3.png"><br>  <i>You can wander through the pages of their site <a href="http://flamboire.ru/">here</a> .</i> <br><br>  <b>3)</b> The third group of users began to use the converter according to the scenario, which we did not initially think about.  They transfer data - and give the rest of the steps at the mercy of freelancers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe4/ca8/e75/fe4ca8e75488435dbba4404c6d0dddde.jpg"><br>  <i>An example of a <a href="http://konstantinkoltin.ru/">site</a> where the owner only imported the page, and the artist completed the rest for 3.5K rubles.</i> <br><br>  So, <b>in part, we invented</b> a data transfer system that can make life easier for customers and freelancers making business cards and simple one-page websites. <br><br><h2>  3. Easter eggs, the request of Theremin, and why all this was </h2><br><h3>  3.1 How to name this thing </h3><br>  The most difficult thing was to learn how to transfer content (FB doesn‚Äôt have 5 types of posts, as he claims) and not break the templates **.  Even if you need to move the white poems about white circles. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4aa/5a7/793/4aa5a779327145ed8b2c317a6a156917.png"></a> <br><br>  The second most difficult issue was the controversy surrounding the name of the working version.  Marketers eventually insisted on changing the name of the project - now it is called uKit Alt.  But we left <a href="https://ukit.com/ru/convert-fb">Easter eggs with ‚Äúenvelope‚Äù</a> . <br><br><h3>  3.2 Request Termena </h3><br><br>  <b>1)</b> People reacted differently to the appearance of the public version of the converter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6af/271/c7f/6af271c7fc3b4bda84b8e0aeabb39842.png"><br>  <i>Weekdays of our sms</i> <br><br>  <b>2)</b> Someone boldly rushed to test the service, although it was designed for the creation of business cards, and not for news projects: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/024/a48/a74/024a48a747df4a008fb29e64fb9f31ce.png"><br>  <i>At the start, only the administrator could convert the page, so that one of the admins converted the RBC page.</i>  <i>Now we have moved away from the scheme ‚Äúonly the administrator can import‚Äù in favor of ‚Äúonly the administrator can edit the result‚Äù *</i> <br><br>  <b>3)</b> And someone, like Peter Termen (great-grandson of the very Lev Theremen), looked to the future: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03f/659/cc9/03f659cc9bf1419e8b99fd2c18a287ee.png"><br><br>  We recently implemented this feature - now news from Facebook can be added to the site automatically. <br><br><h3>  3.3 Why All This Was </h3><br>  Our main user is not a media project or a media person.  Of the 17,000 conversions, most are small cafes, hotels, music and creative projects, entrepreneurs of all stripes. <br><br>  Someone did not have a site, someone already had a site, but ‚Äúnon-adaptive‚Äù, ‚Äúwith complex CMS‚Äù and so on.  Hope that helped them. <br><br>  <b>There were also such cases:</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The old site of one of the users who came</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88c/e8e/bc0/88ce8ebc04da4b71a7d723228a8d8a27.png"><br><br>  <i>The last update of the site is 04/17/2016</i> <br><br></div></div><br>  It seems to us that even the simplest site of the facebook content is better than what lives under the spoiler. <br><br>  <b>Well, we</b> ... We launched a project to which a neural network will be added in future versions.  It will collect people sites in 2 minutes. <br><br>  For now - we will be happy to discuss working with the Facebook API and the work of the service in its current form. <br><br>  <i>Footnotes:</i> <br><br>  * Due to the fact that only the administrator could start the conversion, we could take more types of content from the public page, including reviews.  It seems that we are the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276102/">first</a> in this business.  But now the version is working, where you can skip the step with registration at the start - already on the way. <br><br>  ** On non-obvious technical problems when importing FB-content to new platforms, a whole post-longrid has gathered - the next one. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308590/</a></p>
