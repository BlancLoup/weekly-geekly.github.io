Want to create a smart home or program a robot?  There is nothing easier.  Simon Monk will not only help you deal with wires, contacts and sensors, but also show you how to make all this tangle of wires and boards do what you need.  Arduino is not as difficult as it seems at first glance.  You will immediately be conquered by the opening opportunities. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Arduino's interface boards provide an inexpensive and easy way to create projects based on microcontrollers.  With a basic knowledge of electronics, you can make your Arduino board do whatever you want - from lamp control in creative installations to power distribution in the solar power system. <br><br>  There are many books describing projects and demonstrating how to connect external devices to an Arduino board, including the book ‚Äú30 Arduino Projects for the Evil Genius‚Äù written by the author.  However, this book focuses on Arduino programming.

      This book will tell you how to turn programming for Arduino into an exciting experience and avoid difficulties with code incompatibility, which so often causes trouble.  It will guide you step by step through all the steps of C programming, in which programs for Arduino are written. <br><br><h4>  What is an Arduino? </h4><br>  Arduino is a small microcontroller board with a USB connector for connecting to a computer and a multitude of contacts for connecting wires to external devices, such as electric motors, relays, photo cells, LEDs, loudspeakers, microphones and much more.  It can be powered from the computer's USB connector, from a 9-volt battery or other power source.  The card can be controlled from a computer, in the same way it can be programmed, and after disconnecting from the computer it will work autonomously. <br>  The board has an open architecture.  That is, anyone can create their own Arduino-compatible boards.  As a result, competition between manufacturers leads to a reduction in the cost of boards. <br>  In addition to the main boards, expansion cards are available that can be connected to Arduino boards.  In this book, two such expansion cards will be displayed - a liquid crystal display and an Ethernet card, which allow you to turn an Arduino into a small web server.  The software required for programming Arduino is also open, there are versions for Windows, Mac and Linux. <br><br><h4>  What is needed to read a book? </h4><br>  This book is addressed to beginners, but even those who have experience with Arduino and wish to learn more about software. <br>  If you understand this microcontroller or get a clearer idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe basics, you will find here a lot of useful information. <br>  You are not required to have experience in programming or knowledge in electronics, and the exercises in the book will not require you to wield a soldering iron.  All you need is the desire to create.  If you want to get the maximum possible from the book and conduct some of the proposed experiments, then you will need: <br>  - a little insulated wire; <br>  - inexpensive multimeter. <br><br>  Those who want to go even further and experiment with the Ethernet and liquid crystal (LCD) display cards will have to buy these boards, for example in the online store.  See chapters 9 and 10 for details. <br><br><h4>  How to work with this book </h4><br>  This book is organized so as to help beginners gradually move from simple to complex, absorb new information, based on already received.  However, you can skip some initial chapters or skim through them and go directly to the chapter that interests you. <br>  A supporting web site, <a href="http://www.arduinobook.com/">www.arduinobook.com, has been</a> created in support of this book.  There you will find the source code files for all the examples in this book, as well as other resources, such as a list of errors and typos. <br><br><h4>  about the author </h4><br>  Simon Monk has a bachelor's degree in cybernetics and computer science, and a Ph.D. in software engineering.  From school years he was actively interested in electronics and wrote several articles for amateur radio magazines.  Author of the books ‚Äú30 Arduino Projects for the Evil Genius‚Äù and ‚Äú15 Dangerously Mad Projects for the Evil Genius‚Äù. <br><br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/drugie-prog/product/programmiruem-arduino-osnovy-raboty-so-sketchami">the publisher's website</a> . <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601956/978549601956_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601956/978549601956_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  For Habrozhiteley a 25% discount on the coupon - <b>Arduino</b> <br><br>  Together with our partner, <a href="https://giftd.ru/">Giftd</a> , we developed a solution with which you can send our books as a gift in 1 minute.
