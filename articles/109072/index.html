At about the 15th, it appeared in most European online stores, and the parcels with the phones inside rushed to their new owners.  Two weeks later, the unit got to me. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  At the first meeting with the device, I was surprised in a pleasant way, because  the device turned out to be smaller (the thickness, which was wept in the comments, is imperceptible, and the device itself seems to be a ‚Äúlittle slick‚Äù), the screen seemed bigger, the assembly is very high quality, everything is in place, the phone is comfortable and looks at least 25 thousand . <br><br>  After a little digging and finally skipping registration in MotoBlur ªe (I still can not say how it happened with me), the first launch was made.  Yes, the first time it was loaded for a long time, but this is only the first time.  Quickly connecting to Wi-Fi (they didn‚Äôt make friends right away, but after rebooting the router, for some reason, everything was in place) a link was made to the Google account.

      A little later, the <strong>root</strong> was obtained using the <strong>z4root</strong> application (it is searched without problems in the market).  Again, this action went against the comments on the article.  It was stipulated that the motor cars were very well protected and it would not be easy and soon to get the root, but even before the appearance of the apparatus, craftsmen were found in the warehouse.  The most important question that is still relevant for me is the possibility of getting rid of MotoBlur.  It is really unpleasant (for me personally) and eats memory even in the background.  Just as I‚Äôm slowly removing standard programs, I haven‚Äôt experienced any problems so far. <br><br>  For those who doubted that the device can withstand water - the device is really not afraid of water, checked more than once, so the video on the network is not a fake.  For those who doubted the battery - I do not know how other devices behave with a similar frequency of the processor and the size of the RAM, but this device gives me a day with active use (not to be confused with ‚Äúyana letting go‚Äù), which I am satisfied with.  The screen is durable, but there are scratches at an angle, although when the display is on, there is not even a hint of them.  I will still buy the film later. <br><br>  Now about disappointments.  Despite the smart work, the phone almost does not take out on the street.  At the current temperature in Siberia (this is from ‚àí10 to ‚àí25), the screen and touch buttons refuse to react to frozen fingers (and the situation is similar with warm ones).  You have to do the following: lock the device, unlock, check if it works;  if not working, then repeat.  Usually, after pressing the power, the screen reacts to unlocking (allows you to pull on the ‚Äústrip‚Äù), but then dies off.  This very problem gave me quite a bit of inconvenience and a lot more of it, because  there is still a whole winter ahead, and the frost will not be limited to ‚àí35 degrees.  On the other hand, I myself am guilty, because  in the instructions <s>suddenly!</s>  There is such a point as: <br>  ‚ÄúAvoid temperatures below 0 ¬∞ C / 32 ¬∞ F or above 45 ¬∞ C / 113 ¬∞ F.‚Äù <br>  I hope that somewhere there is such a cover so that the <s>antenna catches the</s> phone to keep warm?  If yes, let me know. <br><br>  This surprises for me ended.  Although some also indicate a problem with the speaker.  The remaining problems are solvable. <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> I did not personally take pictures of the phone, shoot a video, conduct various tests, because  all this is full on the Internet, but the full opinion of any of the Russian users is not published :) <br><br>  <strong>UPD</strong> .  Yes, I completely forgot.  Most also wondered if the phone would be localized.  At the moment I am using completely English localization (I feel more comfortable), with the exception of the Russified desktop and a couple of programs.  But the localization is promised, because  apparently the device we will have sold.  It is likely that the Russian firmware will be immediately on Froyo.  For those who can not wait, there is a special application <strong>Morelocale</strong> , which will solve the problem of localization of interest at 60-70. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109072/</a></p>
