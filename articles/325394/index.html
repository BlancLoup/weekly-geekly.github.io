  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Horoscope for developers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, <b>the day of laughter</b> , I am glad to share with you a horoscope for developers.  Treat him with humor and smile more often! <br><br>  If by a happy coincidence you have found something in common with the characters, write in the comments. <br><br>  Author's illustrations prepared by <a href="https://dribbble.com/zaderaka">Anton</a> , for which he thanks a lot! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ec/288/169/8ec288169c364bef854f84f111956e29.png"></div><br><h3>  Aries </h3><br>  Aries often considers itself right in everything and is difficult to convince.  He does not explain that the code is bad, that he has a conflict with QA or the solution is wrong!  Aries has a strong character and pronounced leadership qualities, so he can often be found among technical project leaders or area managers.  Aries's honesty does not know the limits; they can tell the client and the manager everything they think about the project, and for one thing and their account.  Aries-programmers are full of new ideas, but they are trying to push their implementation to younger developers.  Aries love to search for adventures on their project and take off in the team is unlikely to ever be boring.  In a difficult situation, always waiting for explanations from the manager, and the sooner he gets them, the better.  The manager needs to let Aries speak out and pour out his soul, then it will be easier for him!  Do not think that Aries is aggressively opposed to you, the client, or the team, he really supports the common cause and wants to settle the problem as soon as possible.  Under the sign of Aries released Angular2. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27b/d70/f86/27bd70f866b046b7affd69774759463d.png"></div><br><h3>  Taurus </h3><br>  The developers of this sign are stubbornly superior to Aries, but Taurus can be traced easy negligence in the gita, when Aries has everything there is clear.  The Taurus programmer can be very stubborn, he will not respond for a long time to Tekhlid‚Äôs request to remove all the excess from the program, or the sysadmin‚Äôs desire to clean everything unnecessary in his PC.  Taurus does not like change, and therefore does not like to change projects, is very attached to the teams, client or manager.  For the right to work in the old team will sign up for any period and TK.  Anyway, everything new is painful; it will never support the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtransferring a project to a new technology stack.

      Taurus hopes that new requirements from the client, problems with communications, and a way out of assessments will be resolved on their own without any intervention on their part.  However, if the Taurus developer began to express something to you, you know, he endured for a very long time and now this end of patience has come to an end.  Give it due attention, show care and the conflict will be settled.  The recommended programming language is PHP. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35c/d44/d60/35cd44d60cb8494fb211d5be0d84c5cc.png"></div><br><h3>  Twins </h3><br>  With them, the team is very noisy, and even if you have one twin developer, it seems that there are two or even four of them by the amount of information transmitted.  They may take all the time of the meeting, they will have to organize some more in the hope of letting other members of the team have their say, but they will also take the time of additional meetings. <br><br>  The twins manage to manage to do several things at the same time and write code, and do TK, and test and correct the designer.  At the same time, it always seems to them that life passes by, that their productivity is low, that they are overestimated, even if they have a dozen simultaneous projects.  Despite the desire for independence, Gemini works well in teams of programmers, experiencing the need for parallel programming, curator or mentor.  When there are problems or conflicts within the team on the project, the Twins try to switch to another project or lie low.  If you want to direct their activities in the right direction, make an appointment with them, draw up a plan for their development, walk through the project plan and argue your desire to engage in specific tasks.  They perceive logic very well.  The recommended programming language is Python. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9c/ced/878/d9cced878f8749f4aaba1be6bdc93d73.png"></div><br><h3>  Crayfish </h3><br>  Cancer is very responsible for working issues, while it is very sensitive and vulnerable.  One negative feedback from a client can knock him out of the workflow for long weeks. <br><br>  Therefore, it is important to filter the entire flow of information for it, starting from customers, ending with the company's decisions.  Take care of the crayfish!  It is best to solve the problem before he himself understands what is happening around.  Cancer can present a broken deadline, imbued with this picture and believe in its reality, and then complain to the manager that the project is rolling into hell.  Very often, when a new programming language is chosen in Cancers, the skeptic suspect is included. <br><br>  Cancer is best suited to work on your project, the team often upset him.  However, the results of his work are excellent, he is picky about himself and customer-oriented, is able to predict the occurrence of risks on the project and to eliminate their symptoms in advance.  As a rule, Cancer is a great system architect.  The recommended development platform is .NET. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04d/968/8a5/04d9688a551149a4b9cdd91f99bf5130.png"></div><br><h3>  a lion </h3><br>  Lev believes in the perfect code, more precisely in his own code.  He appreciates the results of his work very much and is happy when others notice it.  He likes compliments very much, so he always tries to get feedback from clients or managers.  ‚ÄúWhat would you do without me,‚Äù he unequivocally makes it clear to the entire project team. <br><br>  Able one day to go work overtime, but not just so, and so that everyone once again imbued with its uniqueness and irreplaceability. <br><br>  Injured.  If someone offends him, then it becomes very difficult to work with him.  He will refer the manager to the rules and instructions, which, of course, do not describe in detail what is specifically required of the employee.  Leos better go to test automation or 1C, but it's worth noting that Leo with the same skill can use a variety of programming languages. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4a/8cb/460/d4a8cb46029b47c7868141db6a2b0848.png"></div><br><h3>  Virgo </h3><br>  Virgo is a cruel realist coder.  These programmers are able to talk nicely with the manager about the next batch of edits and going to work on the weekend, and in his head to draw pictures of revenge. <br>  They like accuracy in work, planning, they even drink tea on a schedule, because there must be order in everything.  Virgo loves to play the nerves of the manager and start to suffer to the public, that the project is not interesting, the customer is inadequate and in general everything is ashes.  However, she is ready to sit at night on her personal projects and at the same time receive real pleasure from coding.  It is a pity that quickly loses interest in them.  Do you want to discuss with the Virgin of a problem on a project - get ready for a meeting in advance, think over scenarios of her behavior, choose words.  The main thing is to earn trust, and then it will be easier for Virgo to program well with Objective C and Swift. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa4/e0b/6b1/aa4e0b6b15f24bf3a898cc00a2ff8316.png"></div><br><h3>  Libra </h3><br>  Programmer-scales do not like planning, because it is not strong in it.  Hard to give estimeyty.  Scales are always looking for ideals: an ideal project, an ideal manager, an ideal code.  But there is not enough time to study the rules of working with Jira or to write legible and understandable reports.  He likes fashion trends in development, and can make a long decision on small issues: github vs gitlab;  objective C vs Swift, etc.  Always looking for balance, but the programmer nature outweighs the high spiritual ideals.  It often has cognitive dissonance between reality and the desired. <br><br>  The presence of Libra in a team is always welcomed by its members, because it is Libra who is ready to take all the blame for the failure on the project.  It's easier for them than to listen to the argument for a long time who is right and who is wrong.  If the programmer-Libra gets angry at you, in a fit of revenge he is able to write viruses that kill everything and everyone on the project, so be vigilant and do not quarrel with Libra.  Recommended programming languages: C ++, C # <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d9/8dd/e39/9d98dde3955e4431b79fb0397f96dc9f.png"></div><br><h3>  Scorpio </h3><br>  The most secretive, but at the same time quick-tempered developer in the team.  Pulling information from a Scorpion from a ready-made solution, if he is not ready to share with her, it is almost impossible.  Introducing a new employee to a project in place of Scorpio is very difficult if this process is not initiated by him.  Very stubborn, almost like an Aries.  Even if you chose a thorny, thorny path - it will go through to the end and will not back down, but it will not complain. <br><br>  Not a fan of creating a backend, more inclined to work with FrontEnd.  The team quickly identifies the weaknesses of colleagues and, in particular, the manager, and then uses it for their own selfish purposes.  At the same time, I am glad to share ideas for improvement, and he has a lot of them.  He loves himself very much, can admire his photo on the honor roll for hours. <br><br>  Working with him in a team is difficult, but possible.  Constant deadlines will help to improve the atmosphere in a team with Scorpio, so that there is no time to distract yourself and mess things up with some inappropriate nonsense. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c49/d17/da9/c49d17da96644426b34064ce0287c075.png"></div><br><h3>  Sagittarius </h3><br>  Sagittarius by nature philosophers.  They like to speculate about the eternal, while trying to impose their opinions not only on team members, but on the manager, the client, the managers, and the directors.  If they talk about the case, it is perceived as a healthy initiative, and if not, then as idle chatter.  At the same time, they are very upset and perplexed when listeners are inclined to the second option. <br><br>  If you are in the same team on a project with an archer, you have every chance of completing it successfully, no matter how high the risks, uncertain requirements and intractable customer.  Sagittarius has the intuition and the ability to go safely from any, even the most difficult alterations.  For this, he is very much loved in the team, so he easily acquires friends and allies.  Do not hurt the archers, they can severely take revenge on you, if by the time of the plan for revenge, they have not cooled, which often happens.  Sagittarius is easily appeased. <br><br>  Sagittarius can not hold the information, telling everyone the truth about the problems of the project, even if it is a client, leader or director of the company in which he works.  Since hot can blab access, know-how or salary of other employees.  Endowed with a congenital penchant for programming, mobile applications for Android are especially good. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2e/abe/053/e2eabe05324c4b7f84e0be063db622df.png"></div><br><h3>  Capricorn </h3><br>  If a new member of your project team is Capricorn, you might think that he is mournful, dreary, dismal and sad. <br><br>  It will seem to you that his day begins with the phrase ‚Äúno matter how bad it is today, tomorrow it will surely be even worse.‚Äù <br><br>  Do not give in to the first impression, because the happiness of Capricorn in his work, and he is immersed in it completely and without a trace.  In the project, Capricorn predetermines the goal in advance, plans the architecture, develops the details, makes up risks so as not to be further distracted by trifles.  Often, she pulls the job of a manager, which makes him very happy. <br><br>  Idlingly wandering around the Capricorns office you will not find.  If there are no tasks on the project, he will come up with a lesson in the form of refactorings and optimizations, will plan for the manager and do test scripts for QA. <br><br>  You will not get bored with him in the team, you will find how to pin a colleague or leave some surprise in the gita.  If you calmly discuss problems with him, then you will get a solution quickly.  Never raise your voice on Capricorns, they will not forgive you.  And yes, it does great Ruby programming. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff2/78d/191/ff278d19174f4861bf54f8848f86fc52.png"></div><br><h3>  Aquarius </h3><br>  Special signs of this developer - like all managers, everyone wants him in the team.  There are several reasons for this.  First, Aquarius never stops at what has been accomplished, they strive to infinitely improve their programs, refactor and optimize.  Secondly, they are very worried if something does not work, which evoke sympathy.  Thirdly, even if all the projects of Aquarius were collapsed and all deadlines were broken, they manage to hand out advice to their colleagues, which, to everyone's surprise, work.  There is no Aquarius without failed projects in the past.  They also violate the rules completely without remorse, sometimes even with joy. <br><br>  If a difficult situation arises in the project, you will not be able to predict how Aquarius will behave.  He can actively participate in the team work out solutions to problems, he can laugh it all off, or he can ask for privacy to think about everything that happens.  It is a pity that at such moments he may not return soon, and when the storm has already subsided. <br><br>  Thanks to a developed imagination, Aquarius has a tendency to create computer games. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/297/01a/566/29701a566f6b43718ec64c8e6ea3f491.png"></div><br><h3>  Fish </h3><br>  The code of these programmers is unique, they do not like to look for ready-made solutions, they love to create themselves.  That is why the first sentence of this programmer when receiving someone's project will be: "Rewrite!".  In addition, he will rewrite, even if secretly from everyone.  He is very difficult to blame for non-compliance with the rules, the developer-Fish has the unique ability to make honest bottomless eyes, and the manager and even the client will believe him that he is not guilty of anything.  May be at the expense of estimeytov, so, just in case.  However, they should not be offended, their conscience is as well developed as the ability to invent. <br><br>  Coming to the project, Pisces draw images of an ideal client, team, manager, and then they are offended at all that in reality they are not the same as in Pisces imagination.  Very vulnerable.  They can easily abstract away from work, leaving for their underwater world.  At the same time, they quickly return, full of energy and enthusiasm. <br><br>  Well manifest themselves as FrontEnd developers. <br><br>  All great weekend and good mood! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325394/</a></p>
