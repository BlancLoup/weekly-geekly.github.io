But there was still no one on the topic of seeing this whole picture by an introvert programmer.  Who was interested - welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Little about the subject of the situation </h5><br>  MySQL + PHP programmer, 31 years old, married. <br><br>  True introvert: <br>  - While all adolescents indulged in inserts from gum, vodka and girls, he fiddled with electrical engineering, radio components, microchips, circuitry, zx spectrum, ibm pc, bbs, fidonet, internet, linux and further down the list. <br>  - The very image of a bot who has been blaming everyone for solving computer science tasks and programming courses because he could not refuse them when they asked him. <br>  - The very image of "zadrota", which some aspects knew better than their teachers in school, in courses and in the institute, because of which sometimes it entered into an argument with them. <br>  - He left the institute when he realized that he would not be given anything new from practical knowledge of his specialty at the institute.  And then he returned to the correspondence only for the sake of "crust." <br>  - It is very hard to accept new people in your social circle. <br>  - Which is painfully difficult to do something that is associated with communication with unfamiliar people (everyone remembers the introvert comics? Everything is straight to the point about him!). <br>  - Able to concentrate on complex things, to keep quite complex models in my head (until my colleague on a less important issue distracts one more time). <br>  - LII according to socionics (Logico-Intuitive Introvert). <br>  - He is interested in new technologies and studies them with desire. <br>  - A bunch of items that are inherent in this very introvert. <br><br>  True techie: <br>  - analysis of toys in childhood (And how does it work?) <br>  - analysis of everything else at school age (How does this thing work?) <br>  - fan of circuitry (triggers, (de) encoders, adders, CPU, memory, data buses, input / output ports, etc.) <br>  - the first computer zx spectrum (basic, assembler, protection programs on film and floppy disks) <br>  - ibm pc: basic, pascal, delphi, c, assembler (everything is shorter than everyone else) <br>  - linux: compiling kernel and other software, KDE under FreeBSD ¬©, fidonet node under Linux. <br>  - internet: their sites, advertising earnings in the 90s, seo-optimization and so it went ... <br>  - LAMP: Well, everything is clear: the first hello-world, the first query to the base, the first index, the first query optimization, the first nginx, the first optimization for high-load, the first partitioning, the first sharding, the first NoSQL solution ...

      The subject has grown to that state in which the understanding comes: <br>  - The importance of not only the result of programming, but also the readability of the code, its reuse.  In a word, the importance of a programming culture. <br>  - The realization that learning all web technologies is no longer possible at the moment, as they appear faster and faster, and the rate of change of existing ones does not allow one to be aware of all their changes. <br>  - The importance of the field of application of a particular technology, and the details in the programming process can be quickly clarified on the Internet. <br>  - There are still a lot of points about what comes to time with every adequate programmer in the course of his long-term activity. <br><br>  And so, behind such a subject, there is quite a lot of life experience, a lot of programming experience, several interesting projects that he can tell with pleasure, a rather broad outlook, many interesting hobbies not related to computers.  We now turn to the situation itself. <br><br><h5>  Situation </h5><br>  Since our subject is an introvert, he treats his current work duties and projects with great attention and responsibility: sometimes he is detained for free, sometimes he comes early, sometimes he checks their work from home.  Ie in general, he is passionate about his work.  Coupled with thoughts like ‚ÄúHow will all this work without me?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow will colleagues without me cope with all this?‚Äù, All this gives the effect that the subject works on duty at each place of work.  Minimum - 2-3 years in one place.  As a result, the time comes when, at the next place of work, everything new has been studied long and long, the current salary demotivates, and also spit over the conditions of work that flash on various headhunter resumes. <br><br>  There comes a critical moment, and our subject rolls out a detailed resume and begins to go for vacancies.  And here is the first interview.  Unfamiliar room, unfamiliar people, nervous tension ... And here are the familiar satellites of the introvert: <br>  - Closure <br>  - The state of stupor (when the brain is not able to give an answer to a fairly simple and obvious question) <br>  - There are many other ‚Äúpoints‚Äù that generally result in a state of ‚Äúdibilism‚Äù (forgive me for this word, but it rather accurately conveys this state) to one degree or another. <br>  The most interesting thing is that the brain of the subject in this situation is perfectly aware of all this.  There comes an understanding that "here it has ... started ...".  All this acts even more depressingly, which is why the internal nervous tension increases even more.  It turns out a vicious circle, which is very hard to break. <br><br>  The outcome of this situation is sad: <br>  On the employer's side, a candidate came with an interesting resume, which could not properly answer a single question.  As a result, there are posts that people come for big money who do not know anything.  I do not speak for everyone, but a certain percentage of the ‚Äúunknowing‚Äù are those introverts. <br>  On the part of the subject - blame yourself for not being able to answer fairly obvious questions.  Well and the accompanying demotivation, depression and low self-esteem.  As a result, there are such posts as this. <br>  The employer missed a valuable candidate, and the candidate missed a valuable employer. <br><br>  And what next?  And then the subject goes to the second interview, the third, the fourth, the fifth ... In the end, gets to the employer who can evaluate his knowledge and experience in one way or another. <br><br><h5>  Who is to blame and what to do? </h5><br>  Both are to blame. <br>  The employer is guilty because he was unable to build the correct system of assessment of knowledge and experience, taking into account the various psychological types of candidates. <br>  The subject is guilty of not trying to deal with their problems and fears. <br><br>  The employer should use various tools in assessing the knowledge of the candidate in addition to the usual office interview: <br>  - relatively complex test tasks for several hours of work (there is little chance of finding a ready-made solution, and you can immediately evaluate the programming culture, the availability of comments, and many other nuances).  An introvert will gladly take on such a task if the position is really interesting to him.  It is important for him to show his result in practice. <br>  - interview for other knowledge not related to IT topics (this allows revealing the personal qualities of the candidate). <br>  - correspondence testing with a lot of questions. <br>  - various indirect signs: the presence of their own projects, profiles on popular IT-resources and so on. <br>  Separately, I want to tell you about antipatterns: <br>  - telephone interview with verbally assigned tasks.  Firstly, an orally assigned task to a programmer is a big chance that the task will be misunderstood the first time.  Secondly, it is very difficult for an introvert to concentrate on a task in such conditions.  A cheater may well google the answers to questions.  I didn‚Äôt particularly expect this type of interview from Badoo. <br>  - minor questions regarding the syntax during the face-to-face interview.  For example, I used the iconv function several thousand times, but I constantly forget the sequence of parameters.  Or I constantly forget whether there is a mysqli_fetch_assoc function or not.  But I know where all this can be easily viewed if necessary.  The introvert's answer to such minor questions is quite obvious: I do not know, but I can google it.  For it is impossible to remember all the little things.  Especially if the introvert forgets a lot in stressful situations.  And in this case, it all starts to look like a game of roulette: this question has fallen into the realm of what you remember, or missed. <br>  - employers very often take on the substitution of concepts: they are looking for a good specialist for themselves, and they take only those who successfully complete their ‚Äúsystem‚Äù of interviews.  Feel the difference?  "Good specialist"! = "Successfully passed the interview."  Many times I witnessed how they took to work "a headache", which went away after 2-3 months, just because this "headache" scored the most points in the test at the interview, but in fact it turned out that To code something is normal and does not know how, just her memory is good.  Conclusion - test your candidates versatile! <br><br>  The subject also needs to deal with their fears and fears: <br>  - Often go on interviews, even if the current work is quite satisfied to get used to them.  Be aware of the requirements of employers, as well as go to a more interesting job, if you want. <br>  - Understand your fears, analyze them and deal with them: get used to being in uncomfortable conditions, learn to communicate with unfamiliar people. <br><br>  PS: Good luck to you, introverts! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285546/</a></p>
