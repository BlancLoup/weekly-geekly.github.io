We‚Äôre interested in making this position more sophisticated.‚Äù which is fully in line with our intention to launch Twitter shares on the market. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Michael wrote yesterday that Maidol was the main Twitter acquisition this year, but he, like Blaine Cook, will soon leave the company.  In talking about the reasons for the dismissal of Maidol, it is noted that his departure from the company may be associated with frauds with the company's shares.  Nevertheless, when Maidol got a job, the company spoke very flatteringly about him: ‚ÄúHis huge potential in developing global stock trading systems was the main reason for taking him to work.‚Äù <br>  So what has changed in such a short time of his tenure? <br><br>  Ironically, the peak of Twitter activity falls just in the current year, especially after they stopped working with Joyent and went under the wing of NTT America.  This, of course, is not the limit of dreams (the weekend this week was not very good), but if Twitter‚Äôs performance grows, a quite reasonable question arises - what really happens in the company? <br><br>  The management does not publicly announce its plans, but we know that the company is looking for new investors (this is also indicated by SAI information), despite recent investments of $ 5.4 million just 9 months ago.  If you do not take into account the licensing deal in Japan, Twitter still does not have a certain source of income, and if the company is now looking for new investments, all this indicates one thing - $ 5.4 million is running out.  In the absence of revenue, Twitter simply changes the awl to soap.

      Similarly, for Biza Stone, the situation with the Blogger resource is taking shape (Blogger had a minimal income, thanks to the subscriptions to the newsletters and before the sale of Google there was completely no advertising).  Time goes on, nobody buys Twitter, and the money runs out.  Maybe the current difficult situation is not the best way reflected in the management of the company?  Most likely, it is this, and not fraud with shares, that is the reason for the dismissal: if Cook was dismissed due to fraud, then why delay his dismissal, especially taking into account the events of last year?  Why does a specialist like Maidol, who is so praised by Twitter, leave his post after so short a stay on it, if everything is in order in the top leadership of Twitter? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31538/</a></p>
