And after reading <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153841">this</a> post I could not go past. <br>  Why the whole garden when you can make it easier and safer? <br>  In total, it is necessary to open the voting results and de-identify the data! <br><br><ol><li>  Enter a special identifier (random set of numbers and possibly letters, not in order).  Bulletins are already numbered, but a different meaning is attached to the identifier. </li><li>  To each voter to issue a document protected from counterfeits fixing his choice (let's call it ‚ÄúVoice‚Äù, with a capital letter and in quotes) so that he does not change his mind and, if anything, could prove that his voice was taken into account incorrectly.  It may simply be a certified copy of a completed newsletter. </li><li>  Publish (for example, on the site) the voting results: the identifier and the corresponding choice in the open list. </li></ol><br>  Problems and solutions: <a name="habracut"></a><br>  There must be a person who will reassure you and give you a Voice.  Exactly he and only he will be initiated into your secret.  And your last name is not necessary for him to know.  Your passport can be checked by another person.  This process is very easy to automate, completely eliminating the participation of the initiate.  Nowhere should be recorded the correspondence of your identifier of your personality. <br><br>  In the "Voice" is not necessarily indicate your name and surname.  In the case of an incorrect account of your choice, it is not at all necessary to go to the court or the CEC yourself and make unnecessary movements.  It is enough to transfer the ‚ÄúVoice‚Äù of your favorite party or candidate.  They themselves will understand.  It is in their interest.

      Stuffing.  It may suddenly turn out that in our country there are an additional 50 million voters who, with a single impulse, voted for their favorite party / candidate.  Even in this case, the result of the calculations can deviate from reality is not so significant, since stuffing is not a substitute, and its capabilities are fundamentally limited by statistical data and common sense. <br><br>  Detection of stuffing can be a simple control of the number of voters in the open list.  This number should coincide with the number of real voters.  I think a certain percentage of discrepancies should be recognized as admissible, mistakes happen, we are all human.  Specify this percentage to publish in advance, before the election.  And not to take from the ceiling, but to calculate using the theory of probability and statistics.  In case of serious deviations, the election should be considered invalid. <br><br>  You can read and publish only the voters.  This will also make sure that my voice is correctly accounted for.  If I did not vote, then I should not find myself on the list.  To exclude a stuffing it is necessary to accurately calculate the number of real (appearing) voters in each polling station.  This can be done reliably, with multiple duplication, by comparing independent measurements of representatives from each party / candidate.  Ultimately, only the total amount for a country that each party / candidate should independently count is relevant. <br><br>  An employer or gangsters or someone else who has an influence on you may require you to demonstrate or even give him your ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù ‚ÄúVoice‚Äù.  It is sad.  But this can and must be fought.  This is a fact of blatant violation of the rights guaranteed to you.  And today, some employers may require to provide a photo taken with a mobile phone, ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù filled in the ballot.  Although after this there is still an opportunity to spoil the newsletter or take a new one, but should we stoop to such petty fraud?  Situations are different, and it‚Äôs not for us to judge, for example, a single mother who is afraid of losing her job.  Therefore, we consider.  It is technically possible to give you not a fake, but a real ‚ÄúVoice‚Äù of a person who has already voted as necessary.  The identity of the voter you do not open.  "Voice" when copying will not be two.  In this case, the risk of exposure is almost zero.  Only if you work for the same employer, and he is not too lazy to compare the identifiers of all the ‚ÄúVoices‚Äù extorted.  At the same time, it is still not clear whose ‚ÄúVoice‚Äù is genuine and where is the copy. <br><br>  The generation of identifiers should be carried out immediately.  You must first see your ID, and then make your choice, and in no case the opposite!  This is especially true for automated systems.  Otherwise, a situation may arise when the entire country voted for the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù party / candidate with one ‚ÄúVoice‚Äù with one identifier.  "Voice" when copying does not become two.  The lack of voters can be compensated by stuffing, so, once again, first you get your ID, then you make a choice, and in no case the opposite! <br><br>  The list in the public domain should be available all at once.  That is, I should be able to download the entire list for myself, for example, in the form of a database in order to calculate (one SQL command who understands) for whom, how much, and how much.  If, for example, on the site you can, by entering your ID, find out for whom he voted, and cannot get the entire list, then this means that you are not trusted, but they consider themselves ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù. <br><br>  The dynamics and results of elections may change if special measures are not taken to protect against information leakage.  The person who will give us the Voices can silently count the votes and upload intermediate results in real time, for example, on Twitter.  One or more of these leaks will not play a special role, but if this stream is picked up and saddled by the media, this may affect the course of the elections.  I got up for dinner, got ready for the polling station, and the course of the elections is already visible on TV, and it is already clear who won.  Does it make sense to go now?  Or vote like everything, just in case?  But this problem is easily solved organizationally. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154295/</a></p>
