The latter, on the contrary, will give you clear and understandable advice on the choice of fonts and the design of documents and books. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://filegiver.com/free-download/Yan-Chikhold-Obraztsy-shriftov.pdf">Jan Chihold - Font Samples</a></b> <br>  Those who underestimate or do not understand the meaning of fonts and the complexity of their creation are very wrong.

The author not only collected the best examples of typographic fonts presented in the book in real size, Jan Chihold explains those basic rules, guided by which you can take the first steps in creating your own really beautiful fonts. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://filegiver.com/free-download/Anna-Lander-Samouchitel-Adobe-InDesign-CS5.pdf">Anna Lander - Tutorial Adobe InDesign CS5</a></b> <br>  This tutorial is designed for those who want to quickly and fully master the work with such a multi-faceted design tool like Adobe InDesign.  The book discusses one of the most popular versions of this package - CS5.  The basis of the presentation of the material is not dry presentation of the program, the basics of preparation for publication, work with styles, color and large documents.  It uses an effective teaching methodology, which is used in the training of designers in various educational institutions. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://filegiver.com/free-download/Baldin-Kompyuternaya-tipografiya-LaTeX.pdf">Baldin - LaTeX Computer Printing</a></b> <br>  LaTeX is a professional tool for macro expansion of the TeX computer layout system.  Its development requires careful study of many commands, layout techniques and typing.  This is where this book comes in handy.  There are more than 1,300 teams and 750 packs and styles.  The book will also tell about the practical side of LaTeX: effective work with tables and presentations, graphic objects and bibliography.  And, of course, a lot of attention is paid here to the key advantage of the package - the set of mathematics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245953/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245953/</a></p>
