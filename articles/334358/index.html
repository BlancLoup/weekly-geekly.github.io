  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to pass ISTQB¬Æ Foundation Level in Russian: Tester Certification Cheat Sheet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Writing this article was prompted not so much by the recent acquisition of the coveted status of ISTQB Certified Tester, but rather by the collection of bits and pieces of materials for preparing for the exam.  For example, the last article on Habr√© on this topic was <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/luxoft/blog/146064/">in 2012</a> .  Plus, most of the materials imply an exam in English, but I preferred to take it <b>in Russian</b> (as it turned out later, on the same day, I didn‚Äôt have English in me). <br><br>  And although there is a well-established opinion in the network that there are no test exams in Russian, this is not true.  Therefore, if you are preparing for the ISTQB Foundation Level exam in Russian - welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Some lyrics </h3><br>  First, a few words about certification itself.  As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Software_Testing_Qualifications_Board">Wikipedia</a> says, the system originated in Scotland (Edinburgh) in 2002.  The purpose of the appearance is to standardize the knowledge and skills of testers.  Now the certificate is recognized in <a href="http://www.istqb.org/istqb-where-you-are/your-local-member-board.html">56 countries</a> . <br><br>  The system is three-level, the readout comes from below - for clarity, I will give a picture.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2b3/dee/3f1/2b3dee3f17a140469de1b8cea4627632.png"></div><br>  In Russia, exams 1 and 2 levels are available for passing.  The cost of a single exam is 150 euros, while the level 2 examinations consist of several stages of 150 euros each.  In this case, you can pass in Russian only the very first exam of the basic level, which we will talk about later. <br><br><h3>  Self-training </h3><br>  The main materials used for self-training - a <a href="http://www.rstqb.org/ru/istqb-downloads.html">glossary and outline</a> .  There is no newer translation for 2011.  Before learning, you should immediately give yourself a moral attitude to ‚Äúunderstand and forgive,‚Äù since  Many terms overlap in meaning, but not in writing.  Especially with this glossary sins, producing lines of the format "A - see B".  It is important to immediately understand that the professional experience of the tester (if any) will not help much in the exam process, so it‚Äôs better to remember the logic and definition in the form in which they are given in the materials - the questions will be severe and merciless. <br><br>  After a long (or not so) study of these two books, a logical question arises - where can you ‚Äútouch‚Äù the questions themselves?  And then an interesting fact comes out - now ISTQB is run by the Global Association for Software Quality (GASQ).  It is to this organization that all your data is sent during registration and it is she who will send you letters in the future (but more on that later).  So, on the GASQ website there is a wonderful section of <a href="https://www.gasq.org/en/certification/sample-exam.html">test exams</a> , where you can easily <b>pass the exam in Russian</b> . <br>  But not without nuances: <br><br>  <b>1.</b> To be able to register with your browser, you must <b>allow this site to open pop-up windows</b> - individuals.  agreement with the button that translates to the registration form is displayed strictly in a pop-up window.  Without this adjustment of the browser settings, you will only be able to contemplate the blinking page with sadness. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> The trial exam is available <b>once</b> for one registration.  True, this does not implement validation of the entered data and ip, so nothing prevents you from re-registering to the same mailbox. <br><br>  From the good news - now the ‚Äúcombat‚Äù exam is taken on computers, so it is useful to pass the probe at least for familiarizing with the interface - it is identical for both options. <br><br>  So, you have passed a test exam, scored some percentages - how to understand where were wrong and what were the mistakes?  After all, the form of the results gives only a section in which X of Y questions were correctly answered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/35d/ae1/a55/35dae1a5523140718569058ae6954988.jpg"><br><br>  And here we are come to the rescue by the page of analysis of answers in Russian from the <a href="http://us8.campaign-archive2.com/%3Fu%3D7ea501b2a5f45b2eb61e31517%26id%3Dee786ac5c8">Belarusian National College of Testers</a> !  The importance of their text can not be overemphasized, because  similar results for your ‚Äúcombat‚Äù exam GASQ offers to get you for 60 euros.  By the way, a careful tester will notice that the questions in the test exam and questions in the analysis of answers are the same, only the numbering of answers may differ. <br><br><h3>  Directly exam </h3><br>  The books are notched, the test exam is decided by 95-100%, the candidate is ready for battle - what's next? <br>  To begin, register for the <a href="https://www.gasq.org/en/certification/exam-booking.html">exam</a> in the date of your interest in the desired city.  I strongly recommend doing this directly in GASQ, since  The link from the RSTQB website (the official representative of certification in the Russian Federation) still leads to the form of GASQ.  During registration, it is better not to indicate anything in the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù field - otherwise, by default you will be considered an employee and will be paid by invoice in a bank.  We leave the field empty, the payment method, select "Credit card".  About the fact of payment will be slightly lower. <br><br>  After registration, you will write a charming (hopefully) girl from GASQ confirming your reservation and will warn you that there will be a separate letter if the exam is confirmed on the specified date.  Let me dwell here in more detail: yes, registration for a specific date does not mean that the exam will be 100% - there may be a shortage or other force majeure circumstances.  In this case, there will be a transfer of the exam to the nearest date, of which you will be notified by letter.  Further, 8-10 days before the exam, your chosen date disappears from the registration lists - this only means that registration was closed (again, if you postponed registration for the last moment and ‚Äúflew‚Äù, you still have a chance - my colleague late in registering through the form, I resolved the issue by writing to the GASQ contact address). <br><br>  The confirmation letter usually arrives 6-7 days before the exam.  It shows the date, time and address of the exam.  Usually it is either an office of an IT company or an office of a training center. <br><br>  Why haven‚Äôt I touched my exam fee yet?  The fact is that the invoice comes to you exactly 24 hours before the exam.  If you choose a payment method, the card will have two letters - an invoice in the form of a pdf document and a separate link to the card payment form (I have a <b>letter with payment url dropped into spam</b> , so keep this in mind).  Here, if you accidentally registered as a company representative and understand that 24 hours is not enough to pay through a bank branch, you can ask for a re-invoice for payment by card - the girls in GASQ are responsive and prompt. <br><br>  Perhaps, for testers from regions that may spend more than 24 hours on the way to the city of the exam, you need to discuss the issue with payment in advance - as far as I know, you will not be able to pay on the spot. <br><br>  Finally, all organizational and transportation questions are closed, materials are repeated, tests are resolved and you are standing in front of the door to the office.  As I mentioned above, the exam is taken on a computer.  Since  we chose to pass the exam in our native language, its duration will be 60 minutes (for a non-native language, an additional time is given).  The administrator will check your name on the lists (you need a passport or driver's license with you) and will issue a sheet with a login / password.  Login, agree with the license agreement, enter the data (preferably correct, they will then be printed on the certificate).  Now you can proceed, the benefit of the interface you have already studied in detail during the preparation. <br><br>  During the exam, you can not use anything.  The permissible maximum is to solve problems on a blank sheet of paper // sheet with a login / password.  The main thing that needs to be overcome is the initial panic of questions.  As is rightly mentioned in all articles on ISTQB, test questions and the real exam are like arithmetic and mathematical analysis.  From my own experience - many questions on the determination of boundary values ‚Äã‚Äãin the range of 0 &lt;x &lt;100 with different variations;  many questions and tasks to cover the tests of code operators;  there are complex questions on static testing methods (difficult because it is very difficult to remember the differences between inspection, technical analysis and end-to-end control the first time).  There are questions with 98% matching text, but they are not the same and this is not a test bug - read carefully, there is always a key difference in the formulation of the question. <br><br>  The exam timer starts automatically when you open 1 question.  You can solve questions in any order.  If you have finished while the timer is still running and you are confident of yourself - you can end the exam with the ‚ÄúEnd‚Äù button.  Upon completion, the result will be immediately displayed on the screen, as it was in the test exam.  In the case of a positive result, in 5-6 days a letter will arrive on the successful passing of the exam, in another 7-10 days the certificate itself in the form of a pdf-document. <br><br>  <b>UPD 05/10/18</b> Wonderful specialist and just a good person <a href="https://habr.com/users/imdark/" class="user_link">imdark</a> made an excellent site to prepare for istqb in Russian with a large database of questions ( <b>1059</b> at the moment).  The resource is available at <a href="http://istqb.somee.com/">istqb.somee.com.</a> Why it‚Äôs worth paying attention to - the <b>questions here are clearly taken from the ‚Äúcombat‚Äù exam</b> , as opposed to the trial exam on the GASQ website, which still consists of 40 constant questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334358/</a></p>
