  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cisco IP Phone Mini SPA Review SPA502G</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The desire to save once again brought me into the jungle of IP telephony.  Not that I talk a lot with remote subscribers, but I have to spend a decent amount per month.  Now you tell me - "Dude, there is Skype!".  Believe me, I know.  Incredibly, but in fact, in the world there are places where there is no computer, but there is a telephone.  Having studied the tariffs for communication with my provider, I decided and connected myself to a separate IP number.  In this regard, I want to share my impressions of a new device for myself - Cisco SPA502G IP Phone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec6/d58/255/ec6d58255fa0bd8a6a839a7658dd6314.jpg"><br>  Ps.  I say thanks in advance to all network professionals for not minus, but giving useful tips =). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What really seduced me actually IP-telephony?  Of course the price.  As I was promised, the expenses will decrease by two or three times, and the quality of communication will increase significantly (by the way, the call to a mobile phone in Moscow costs me now three times cheaper than from my mobile). <br>  Surely most habrazhiteli familiar with the principle of IP-telephony, but I still briefly mention this. <br>  The choice of apparatus was short-lived; of the options available to me, I immediately refused noname aggregates and D-Link.  There remained Cisco SPA502G and ZyXEL V301-T1.  Not at all wanting to insult the respectable ZyXEL company, I‚Äôll say that the device was not in my hands.  As a result, a box with a Cisco IP phone and a separately purchased power adapter migrated from the warehouse of the selling company to the trunk of my car. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/956/5a8/fb3/9565a8fb3eb80f26aeae51bc61733292.jpg"><br>  The box has quite small dimensions.  Packaging is typical for corporate products - no multi-colored dust jacket.  Brown cardboard and Cisco Small Business lettering - that's all the look and feel. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec6/d58/255/ec6d58255fa0bd8a6a839a7658dd6314.jpg"><br>  The device itself is made in traditional colors - dark gray plastic for the body and the tube, and silver plastic design around the screen.  On the front panel are a numeric keypad and additional buttons. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b83/013/242/b83013242f3778c4efec04d8b1b9bee7.jpg"><br>  Below is the handset connection port and two RJ45 connectors - for the Internet line and for connecting a computer.  This option reduces the number of wires to the router - the computer can be connected "through".  It is enough one wire entering the phone, and another device can be connected to the phone itself.  Conveniently, if the router is located far enough.  In addition, SPA502G supports PoE technology (Power over Ethernet), that is, if the router supports this technology, you can do without an additional power supply.  However, as I wrote above, I had to purchase a separate power supply unit Linksys PA100 (cost about $ 11). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b11/116/327/b111163279be2e0de177ce6ba2e359f9.jpg"><br>  The bundle includes a manual, a documentation disc and a black patch cord. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/454/33d/6a3/45433d6a321208dd42a9a2e4d2b748e0.jpg"><br>  Of the features it is also worth noting the ability to connect a wired headset to the Sub-mini connector (2.5 mm) on the right side and the presence of a stand that will allow you to install the phone almost vertically on the table.  The phone is equipped with the Call Waiting function, which is more needed in the office.  When a second call arrives on the line, it does not deviate, but goes into the queue (the LED indicator starts blinking). <br>  Speakerphone is implemented successfully, the subscriber is heard clearly, without problems. <br>  The process of connecting the device at home did not cause me any difficulties. <br>  The ‚Äútail‚Äù from the router is connected to the ‚ÄúSW‚Äù port, and the patch cord to the computer to the ‚ÄúPC‚Äù port. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea2/780/ae7/ea2780ae73e2409462686ef75d570012.png"><br>  To access the web interface, you must type in the address bar the assigned IP address.  You can learn it as follows: <br>  1. Press the menu button <br>  2. Press button 9 <br>  3. In step 2 you will see the current IP of the device. <br>  In the settings, you must specify the data received from the provider, such as a proxy server, login, access password. <br>  What is the result?  Additional home phone number.  Or only if you settled in a new building, and local telephone networks operate as fast as a 14400 bps modem.  Convenient tool for communication on international and long-distance lines with significantly lower rates. </div>
