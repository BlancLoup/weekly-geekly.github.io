      <b>THESES</b> <br><br>  <b>Web 2.0</b> is a marketing move aimed at increasing traffic.  This is how O'Reilly positions him. <br><br>  <b>Web 2.0</b> is an evolution, not a revolution <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Andrei Sebrant: What is Web 2.0? <br>  answers from the audience: <br>  + interactive user collaboration environment <br>  + increased degree of connectivity <br>  + we do not connect computers, but people (this is not the connection of computers, but people) <br>  + virtual personalities on the Internet <br><br>  <b>Who uses social networks and why?</b> <br>  answers from the audience: <br>  + social network stimulates associative thinking <br>  + virtualization of network space for each individual <br>  + a person in a social network wants to show only those qualities he wants to present <br>  + to know what my friends are doing <br><br>  <b>What has changed for people on the Internet?</b>  <b>Who lives on the Internet for more than 5 years?</b> <br>  answers from the audience: <br>  + software applications moved to the Internet <br>  + In LJ, 250,000 entries appear per day, the audience ‚Äî 1,000,000 (about 5% of the Russian Internet audience. <br>  + A new set of interesting services has emerged, but they have not yet become MASS <br>  + Monetization occurs.  Is it necessary to monetize it? <br>  A lot of people go around the market looking for a monetization model. <br><br>  <b>Who has their own web 2.0 element?</b>  <b>Blog?</b>  <b>Account on photo hosting?</b> <br>  Raised hands: a few percent (WHAT SURRENT the LEADERS) <br>  And who would like to receive money? <br>  - several hands)))) <br><br>  From the audience: I am a photographer - I post pictures, people comment, turn on ICQ, make orders.  And this is really Web 2.0.  Aleksey Belyaev: I was afraid that you would say that you hung the blog and earn $ 20 a year by Google‚Äôs)))))) - this is not Web 2.0))))) <br><br>  <b>The topic of blog monetization was discussed.</b> <br>  Sounded from the audience: <br>  + so that the information is on the wire, it needs to be activated (and money is taken for it. <br><br>  + In Belarus, the girl kept a diary of an alcoholic: She wrote how well in the world to live and work and drink vodka of this brand.  Is it EFFECTIVE OR THIS IS NONSENESS? <br><br>  + Product Placement in blogs. <br>  + contextual advertising <br>  + the credibility of the blog on Yandex was not created by chance <br><br>  + Opinion ... Web 2.0 even prevents you from making money. <br>  For example: I need an encyclopedia - I will not buy it, but I will turn to online encyclopedias.  And I do not need a book, it will only take up space on the shelf ... <br><br>  And what compensates the owners of online encyclopedias costs?  Only advertising model? <br><br>  <b>Interesting FACT: On Yandex traffic jams there is a CAP of those who want to place an advertisement there !!!</b> <br><br>  <b>Question: Part of the audience is teachers !!!</b>  <b>How to attract Internet professionals in the field of education ...</b> <br><br>  <b>The answer is: Cynical and pessimistic</b> <br>  Andrei Sebrant: I worked with schoolchildren and teachers and put an end to this.  The answer is simple: any educational program (‚ÄúNational Project‚Äù) in the field of high technologies - lives when 10% goes to technology, and 90% TO LEARNING !!!  And it is possible to retrain teachers and lecturers only with state money.  This is a state task. <br><br>  We have money pumped into the iron !!!  AND ALL ... <br><br>  The program of computer science in schools was written 10 years ago.  There is no internet or web 2.0.  And you need to learn how to use computers in ITEMS. <br><br>  <b>That is, Web 2.0 in education - the branch is a dead end?</b> <br><br>  Although good Web 2.0 educational projects exist, for example - <a href="http://www.letopisi.ru/index.php/Main_Page">Annals</a> <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br><br>  What good will happen in 2-3 years? <br><br>  + the time factor will work.  New people who know the Internet, Web 2.0, etc. come to schools.  But another opinion was voiced that they simply would not want to go there. <br>  + children are better prepared by Internet technologies <br>  + A student online can present something now.  WHAT? <br><br>  You will laugh ... In the Federal Agency for Education State Research Institute <br>  Informa presented the project (for budget money) - EDITORIAL RESOURCES CATALOG CREATED (another one ???) <br>  Who will arrange the expertise of this project: have the resources been correctly or incorrectly selected ???  Entrust it to the STUDENTS !!!  Users must evaluate. <br><br>  <b>From the author: Why does everyone give up on education?</b> <br><br>  <b>Alexey Belyaev: WEB 2.0 - this is knowledge and skills.</b>  <b>It is necessary to pay attention to this.
