It allowed programmers to use databases to create dynamic sites, while most sites at that time were static.  In the next version (1.5), it became possible to connect your own plugins (tags) written in C ++, thereby expanding the possibilities of the language. <br><br>  The main competitor to ColdFusion at that time was the ASP language, developed by Aspect Software Engineering and subsequently purchased by Microsoft.

      Version ColdFusion 2.0, released in 1997, included about 150 functions, some of which were revolutionary for that time.  For example, the opportunity to work with mail servers (pop / smtp) and the built-in server for indexing and searching information.  Also appeared code editor ColdFusion Studio, facilitating the work of developers. <br><br>  In January 1998, version 3.1 was released, which could work on not only Windows NT, but also Sun Solaris.  In early 1999, version 40 was released, starting from which the language began to move into the corporate market.  This version began to work in a multi-threading mode (multi-threads), security was enhanced, and application clustering appeared. <br><br>  In 2000, Allaire acquired Live Software, which created JRun, the first commercial server for Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE), and began work on modifying the ColdFusion core using Java, which was supposed to provide cross-platform functionality. <br><br>  In 2001, a controlling stake in Allaire was acquired by Macromedia, a competitor company.  After the merger, a version of ColdFusion 5 was released, which included the ability to build dynamic graphs and write your own functions. <br><br>  In June 2002, a version of Macromedia ColdFusion MX 6 was released, which was completely rewritten and based on J2EE (before that, all versions were written using Microsoft Visual C ++).  Starting with this version, ColdFusion now has the opportunity to work with Macromedia Flash. <br><br>  In February 2005, a version of ColdFusion MX 7 was released, in which the possibility of generating PDF, RTF and XLS files appeared.  Also appeared gateways (gateways), which allowed to run asynchronous processes, as well as to use various non-HTTP protocols.  In version 7.0.2, features have been added to work with Adobe Flex 2. <br><br>  In 2005, Macromedia was purchased by Adobe Systems. <br><br>  In July 2007, Adobe ColdFusion 8 was released, with more than 14 thousand programmers taking part in testing, instead of the expected 5 thousand.  This version introduced almost 150 new features, the opportunity to work with graphics, integration with Microsoft Exchange and the use of Microsoft .NET classes, running part of the code in several threads and many other features.  Also, there is a built-in ability to monitor the server and debug applications.  Starting with this version, ColdFusion can be installed on Windows, Mac or Linux. <br><br>  In October 2009, the latest version of Adobe ColdFusion 9 was released, which included ORM, the ability to use only the script language CFScript to develop custom functions and components, integration with Word, Excel, Sharepoint, Exchange and Powerpoint, as well as Adobe Flex and Adobe AIR.  The bundled editor comes with Adobe ColdFusion Builder (or Bolt), working on the Eclipse base. <br><br>  <b>The main advantages of ColdFusion</b> <br><br>  - easy access to databases <br>  - server memory usage for data storage <br>  - application clustering <br>  - use of components written in Java or .NET <br>  - simple work with gateways on other servers <br>  - integration with Flex and AIR <br>  - work with graphics and report building <br>  - work with LDAP, POP, SMTP, IMAP, HTTP, FTP, Microsoft Exchange protocols <br>  - work with XML and RSS / Atom formats <br>  - create PDF files from HTML pages <br>  - Information indexing and search based on the built-in Verity K2 server <br>  - built-in task scheduler <br>  - GUI administration server <br><br>  According to Adobe, around the world, 12,000 companies use ColdFusion on 125,000 servers, and the industry employs about 770,000 ColdFusion programmers. <br><br>  <b>Who uses ColdFusion?</b> <br><br>  Auto: BMW USA, Jaguar Australia, Goodyear, Michelin <br>  Finance: Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase <br>  Technologies: Amkor, Cisco, eBay, Intuit, McAfee, Siemens, Symantec <br>  Production: Boeing, Caterpillar, Logitech, Xerox <br>  Telecom: AT &amp; T, British Telecom, Sprint, Verizon <br><br>  <b>How much does ColdFusion 9 cost?</b> <br><br>  Enterprise version - from US $ 7,499 <br>  Standard version - from US $ 1,299 <br><br>  There are also free versions of Developer and Trial, which have several limitations.  The first will be available only from two computers, and the second after 30 days of work without restrictions turns into the first version. <br><br>  - <i>A ColdFusion</i> is <i>alive or dead everyone must decide for himself.</i> <br><br>  PS <br><br>  <b>Why there is no free version of ColdFusion?</b> <br><br>  There is another CFML development called <a href="http://www.getrailo.com/">Railo</a> (now version 3.1.1), which is quite open source and free.  The Enterprise version of Railo costs US $ 2,999. <br><br>  Another development is <a href="http://www.newatlanta.com/products/bluedragon/">BlueDragon</a> (latest version 7.1), which in my opinion is also free and open-source (in some version). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73465/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73465/</a></p>
