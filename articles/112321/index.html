  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Semi-legal theft by cookies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Part of the habra people are honest and disinterested and attract all sorts of technical stuff.  But some people here and there sometimes are not so disinterested.  Honestly does not want to live.  I will tell you about how you can essentially steal, but without going beyond the criminal code.  Edak with $ 15,000,000. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At once: it will be a question about cookie stuffing.  If you know all this, then you can not read further.  The description is designed for a not very technically savvy user.  What would people from business also understand.  Shod text may seem drawn out.  Jump immediately to the "Technical implementation". <br><br><h5>  Organizational aspect </h5><br>  There are many in the know how the usual affiliate program works.  There is a shop site.  There is a product in it.  Here the owner discovers that it would be nice to also see visitors in this store.  In addition to the obvious type of search engines, a sensible idea visits it: what if, for a small fraction of the revenue, ask people to bring shoppers to the store?  Vasya brought a buyer to the store, left the buyer at the checkout at $ 100 - 10 of them were Vasha for marketing.  The owner, satisfied with his idea, prints a pack of pink cards, some Vasya code is put on them and at the checkout, punching the goods to the customer, the cashier is interested in the buyer with the card.  If there is, the sale is recorded by Vasya as an asset.  Later, he is paid the appropriate commission. <br>  At first glance, the owner does not risk anything.  Indeed, he pays only from the money he received earlier.  However, Vasya does not eat enough to run through the frost, catch people by the sleeve and persuade anyone to go to the unused shop for a thousand years.  He understands that they are paying him in fact not for attracting a client, but by triggering a trigger mechanism - the fact that the buyer has a pink card.  There is an obvious idea: what if you leave the frost, go to the store itself and start distributing cards right in line at the cashier?  And do not even distribute, and quietly shove them into people in the breast pocket, everyone.  After all, some people come into the store themselves, without any persuasion.  And even buy something.  So they stick cards.  In this case, Vasya's earnings will increase dramatically, and even warmer in the room.  The truth is that offline, of course, the owner will immediately notice Vasya and drive him into three letters.  But the Internet is not so transparent at times?

        </script>
      <br>
    <h5>  Technical implementation </h5><br>  The role of pink cards perform cookies.  The store site generates links of the form shop.com/?affID=12, where 12 is Vasya's ID.  shop.com/?affID=12 shows visitors the same thing as just site.com.  Only now the store script also puts a cookie to the visitor, say asdf, and writes in his database: at 12:12:12 12/12/12 Vasya sent us a visitor and we assigned him a cookie asdf.  In parallel, the flow of already ordering passes through the shop.com/thankyou page, where it is reported that thank you, dear buyer, your order number 123 for $ 100 is issued and will soon be delivered.  And at this time the shop script checks under the table: does the buyer have any of the previously set cookies?  And, oops, it turns out that at 12:22:12 12/12/12 on the payment confirmation page, a freshly paid $ 100 appeared as the carrier of asdf cookies, that is, the client Vasya sent.  After that, the time is checked: between the appearance of the then future buyer and the actual purchase, 10 minutes passed.  This is less than the previously agreed period, and therefore the purchase is counted for Vasya.  <i>NB usually this period is calculated in weeks.</i>  <i>30 days is almost standard</i> . <br>  It would seem that all is well and the owner shop.com does not risk anything.  After all, he only pays for the visitors that Vasya actually sent to the store's website.  And only for those who turned into a buyer.  In his presentation, Vasya posted a link like <b>&lt;a href='http://www.shop.com/?affID=12'&gt;</b> on vasya.com the <b>best store! &lt;/a&gt;</b> <br>  And with all his might he runs on the frosty internet persuading people to familiarize himself with his recommendation.  And at this time, Vasya begins to experiment.  To begin with, he puts on his website not exactly a link, but deep into the basement the following code: <br>  <b>&lt;img src = 'http: //www.shop.com/? affID = 12' height = '1' width = '1'&gt; &lt;/ img&gt;</b> <br>  Now, the browser of the visitor to the Vasin site sees the command to draw a picture 1 * 1 somewhere in the basement, and actually take the picture file via the link shop.com/?affID=12.  He obediently runs to this link, takes content from there, but this is not a picture at all.  The browser of the visitor to the Vasin site displays the message ‚Äúpicture ek‚Äù - in the space designated for this one pixel in size.  In short, the visitor does not even suspect the existence of some kind of shop.com, but the browser has exchanged messages with the server shop.com.  The site shop.com/addID=12 downloaded.  And therefore I got my cookie from shop.com.  Thus, Vasya, as you see, solved the issue of imperceptibly sticking those pink cards into the pockets of passersby.  If it so happens that this same visitor of the site vasya.com during the stipulated period still buys something on shop.com - Vasya will receive his share.  And all this despite the fact that in fact he did not do any advertising for shop.com at all.  And not a single click of the traffic donated.  Of course, the img light wedge did not converge.  You can use javascripts or something else.  But for now, let's leave it out. <br><br><h5>  We are getting to the checkout </h5><br>  Forcing cookies by force we already know how.  Now the question is how to get to the checkout, what would be to thrust the card is going to pay.  More, this question will also be in the next series, but for now briefly, purely an idea.  Suppose that Vasya is not just Vasya, but actually a shop.com's direct competitor.  They both sell crocodiles and are terribly hustling in search results.  Potential buyers look at how much Crocodile from Vasya, how much from the owner and somehow decide who to take.  That is, the likelihood that the buyer shop.com was shortly before buying on vasya.com is relatively high.  Here Vasya is recorded in affiliates to a competitor.  Now if the buyer has chosen Vasya, then Vasya keeps all the profit for himself.  If the buyer chose the owner, then Vasya receives at least a commission.  Of course, the fact that Vasya has a lot of thematic traffic is an assumption.  But suppose that Vasya is a clever fellow, he simply went to the competitors shop.com and agreed to place such a code with them for a modest bribe.  In general, more about this in the next series, if the topic is interesting. <br><br><h5>  Financial side </h5><br>  What is all this for?  How much money there is on this small things you can get.  Where did the 15 million in annotation come from?  On August 25, 2008, Ebay sued a certain gentleman named Shawn Hogan and his company Digital Point Solutions.  According to Ibey, Sean punished them for $ 15.5 million between 2006 and mid-2007.  And he is not the only one.  Mr Dunning, the second mentioned in the lawsuit, scored 5.3 million.  Next on the list.  There is something to delve into the details. <br><br><h5>  Legal side </h5><br>  And they will not plant?  The question is correct.  The answer to it, unfortunately, is wrong.  Despite the fact that such operations are in essence theft, however, this is a new topic and lawyers have not yet decided on the qualification of this case.  Ibei's civil suit against Sean and his associates has not yet been resolved by anything.  An attempt to prosecute these people, however, ended more successfully.  On the 24th of June 2010 they were finally taken into circulation.  But only because of a few formal clues.  The very pursuit of Sean and friends became possible only because they lost all fear at all.  Specifically, Sean organized an advertising network where he openly invited people to whom he equally openly wrote: ‚ÄúLet's steal from Ibei together!‚Äù.  And all this in the states.  In other countries there are no problems at all. <br><br>  Additional links: <br>  1. to those who read in English: <a href="http://shopxml.com/uploads/uploaded_files/11494021_1295125183/complain%2520Case508-cv-04052-JF.pdf">Ibei‚Äôs complaint about this whole fraternity</a> .  The original source, and therefore written in difficult legal language. <br>  2. A bunch of <a href="http://www.benedelman.org/cookiestuffing/">examples of technical performance</a> stuffing.  Actually the same <a href="http://www.benedelman.org/cookiestuffing/">English description</a> . <br>  3. There are also charges of <a href="http://shopxml.com/uploads/uploaded_files/11780638_1295664772/dunningindictment.pdf">Dunning</a> (millions are listed on the 3rd page) and <a href="http://shopxml.com/uploads/uploaded_files/11780639_1295664780/hoganindictment.pdf">Hogan</a> (millions also on the 3rd page, in the 7th paragraph). <br><br>  PS Do not throw everything and run to steal millions.  The above scheme, exactly as it is, is caught in 30 seconds. <br>  Basically, the story is enough, but if habra people are interested, then I can separately tell how it is caught, how to bypass catchers and how to scale the process to an indecently rich level.  And how to catch it already.  If interested - say continue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112321/</a></p>
