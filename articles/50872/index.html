    </i>  <i>The first thing that catches your eye is a huge preparatory period on the threshold of a ‚Äústable‚Äù life.</i>  <i>This period is clearly longer than the stability for which he is preparing.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Years spent in school and college implant knowledge and skills that are distinguished by a rigid link to stable situations in life.</i>  <i>We study theories that describe phenomena in their static representation.</i>  <i>We gain knowledge of how to behave in an unchanging world with well-established rules.</i>  <i>It takes years.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>After entering adulthood, each of us is faced with a revelation.</i>  <i>What we studied in school and college has little in common with the real state of affairs.</i>  <i>The order described by the theories studied is completely inappropriate to us as a heritage of the past.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Now, at the current moment, things are not as we expected to see, and we see not what we were ready for.</i>  <i>A few months, in extreme cases, a year or two of naive stability abruptly give way to a crisis that brings the discovery of reality.</i>  <i>This is the first such powerful crisis of personality, caused by the inevitable socialization of a young man.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And this is the first truly great crossroads at which a person makes a fateful choice.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But many people choose to sit mollusk at the bottom of the swamp of their illusions.</i>  <i>Even if these illusions are not their own, but their parents, educators, and trustees.</i>  <i>Sometimes these shells migrate from the swamp to the swamp.</i>  <i>Sometimes they are eaten on the road.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And sometimes they dare to open the doors and look beyond their illusions.</i>  <i>Such attempts occur in the period of the next social crisis, when the society is making another round of development and the obsolete formations are replaced by new ones.</i>  <i>These periodic crises are like a series of new opportunities ... opportunities to become something big.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The next thing that does not fit in the myth of a stable life is that it does not fit into any of the existing theories of human development.</i>  <i>Moreover, this myth does not fit into the course of history, which can be observed by any person during his life.</i>  <i>But, oddly enough, many people believe in the myth, although they have the opportunity to track its inconsistency with the events of their own lives.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>After all, what human history shows us ... Spiral dynamics of the development of society in all areas of life activity.</i>  <i>Technique, economics, biology, psychology and other sciences demonstrate cyclical development and development of new achievements by people.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Hypothesis, data collection, experiments, iterations, proofs and a complete theory with exceptions to the rules that leave room for the next round.</i>  <i>Then, a period of stable use and a new crisis that is not outstanding for its size - again a new hypothesis, data collection and experiments.</i>  <i>And in different areas about the same time periods for each stage.</i>  <i>From 15 to 20 years big cycles and from 4 to 6 years small.</i>  <i>And moreover - from century to century, these cycles are reduced.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But then science, large social formations and countries, finally.</i>  <i>This is their scale of growth measured within two decades.</i>  <i>We, people, are much more flexible and capable of faster growth.</i>  <i>Its high speed lies in our nature.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And our changes can affect the scale and speed of their transitions from one quality to another.</i>  <i>Here, think ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>For 9 months there is a formation of a new living organism with a huge potential of mind and survival.</i>  <i>For about 1 year, the child learns upright walking.</i>  <i>For three or four years - the basics of speech in two or three languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith the appropriate environment.</i>  <i>For the same first three or four years, he masters the fundamentals of mathematics, the knowledge of which later develops at even faster rates (several months, and in some cases, weeks it takes to master multiplication and division) ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A child who is not clogged with patterns and stereotypical reactions spends only a few weeks on the joint comprehension of the foundations of many disciplines.</i>  <i>Combinatorics, systematics, biology, algebra, astronomy, physics, chemistry, sociology, psychology, and so on.</i>  <i>He, like a sponge, absorbs everything that is offered to him in an interesting form for studying.</i>  <i>He demonstrates amazing ability to operate with absorbed knowledge and develops his skills on the go.</i>  <i>The potential is huge.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But most of our potential crowns of nature‚Äôs creation stumble over parental notions of a stable and comfortable life.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Strange, but at some period of our life we ‚Äã‚Äãbegin to believe that this life is given to us for a stable and even existence.</i>  <i>To enjoy the fruits of their hard work.</i>  <i>We begin to believe that the measured course of events in our life will last dozens of years.</i>  <i>Without changes, ups and downs ... we begin to believe that everything is oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-odet well.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Yes, such an installation appears precisely in those periods when we feel good and comfortable.</i>  <i>The mental weakness brought up from childhood wants to believe that it will always be like this.</i>  <i>Well, we tried.</i>  <i>We worked.</i>  <i>So they deserve to be good.</i>  <i>And when ‚Äúgood‚Äù comes, we want to believe that it will always be like this.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>There is not even a talk about the fact that we have forgotten about the cyclical nature of development.</i>  <i>Do not forget that a person lives up to one hundred years, and his cycles are not measured in decades.</i>  <i>No, they did not forget - because they did not even remember.</i>  <i>And in vain ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>STABILITY DOES NOT EXIST!</i>  <i>It is a myth.</i>  <i>The world, nature, change constantly.</i>  <i>Together with the world, man is changing.</i>  <i>Must change.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If we accept these rules of the game, then we grow and develop together with the world around us.</i>  <i>If we do not accept, we get sick and die.</i>  <i>We burn, fired or ravaged, in the fire of the next crisis.</i>  <i>We die, believing that we have been deceived, have not been warned and have not taken care of us.</i>  <i>Bane ...</i> <br><br>  <i>(c) Alexey Romanenko, <a href="http://rezultat.com/market/15/88.html">Result magazine No. 9: ‚ÄúCrisis: dangers and opportunities</a> . <a href="http://rezultat.com/market/15/88.html">‚Äù</a></i> <br><br>  Comments: <br><br>  What is the cause of the crisis?  In addition to the banking system, of course.  In mythology, ladies and gentlemen.  We believe in all sorts of nonsense, without worrying <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/great_quote/48146/">about this bit of thinking</a> .  What does this lead to? <br><br>  To the crisis.  The system is collapsing due to the increasing expenditure of nonrenewable energy to maintain illusions. <br><br>  Stable contours are replaced by attractors (chaos theory) as soon as we (in accordance with the principles of quantum physics) increase our susceptibility by making perception active.
