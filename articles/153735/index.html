  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some life tips for the developer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friday, the evening is near - it's time for an easy philosophy, talking by the fireplace and memories of past affairs. <br><br>  The article consists of two not too connected parts - each of them separately doesn‚Äôt pull on a full-fledged material, and we didn‚Äôt want to dilute thoughts with water. <br>  Nevertheless, the meaning of these parts is one - a few tips that will be useful both to novice developers, and to their older comrades, who themselves, through trial and error, have not yet reached the same conclusions. <br><br><h4>  Part 1. Good coder! = Good employee </h4><br>  Several guys write gorgeous code, they know by heart everything they need to know by heart, they have a lot of experience, they can solve any problem and at the same time they are all not very good workers.  In any case, in the eyes of customers, employers and colleagues. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Vasya - adores saying that he will do everything in three days.  However, when they call him a week later or write to the post office in order to find out what is there with the work, he simply does not pick up the phone and does not respond to the letters.  Instead of honestly saying that he needs 5 more days to finalize and get an understanding ‚Äúgood, we are waiting‚Äù from the customer.  <i>I would kill a reptile.</i> <br><br>  <b>Be honest.</b>  Have in the end cojones to tell the truth.  It's always better than playing hide-and-seek with a companion like a child. <br><br>  Petya does not suffer from Vasina‚Äôs problem, he is always in touch, but it doesn‚Äôt help much, because his speech sounds and reads like a blah blah blah for a normal person.  And the point is not that the interlocutor is too stupid to understand Petya, the fact is that Petya in general, absolutely, catastrophically does not know how to express her thoughts.  In addition, in each "bla" he makes a couple of mistakes and generously sprinkles them with slang and technical terms. <br><br>  <b>Learn to express your thoughts.</b>  Read, read and read again.  And not only the documentation, do not forget, and fiction with journalism. <br><br>  Kohl is honest and can even express himself almost in Russian, but he is not looking for new clients, because his communication with any person begins with ‚Äúgifts‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äù and portions of mothers, which even Viktor Petrovich, who is 30 years old, turns red I worked at a construction site as a foreman.  And if someone says that he would like to move the button a few pixels left, then Kolya immediately tells him in a purely patsan way that he thinks about all the changes in the TK, on ‚Äã‚Äãwhich he turned the customer, with the idiot colleague after which he is offended and goes offline for a couple of days. <br><br>  <b>Be polite.</b>  I do not say that it is necessary to everyone and always refer to "you", fawn, crumble in politeness and compliments in front of the interlocutor and sit at home behind the monitor in a butterfly and a tail coat in case of a Skype call.  Just elementary politeness, especially with new people. <br><br>  <i>I would like to say that all the characters are fictional and any coincidence with real people should be considered random, but I will not say.</i>  <i>I just slightly exaggerated the copies I encountered.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><h4>  Part 2. If you think you are very cool, then with a probability of 99.99% you are an arrogant idiot. </h4><br>  <b>The first time</b> I felt like an incredibly cool typesetter that year in 2002, after reading a couple of ancient HTML textbooks (where even something was told about CSS), I riveted a few of my ‚Äúfan sites‚Äù on computer toys, and a couple sites for friends. <br><br>  There was a thought - "And not to earn this money?".  I responded to the vacancy by distant work, accepted it, and at the layout of the first layout I realized that I did not know anything.  As I remember, a three-column table, but I have no idea how to make two columns of a fixed width, and the third - a rubber one.  Already js-scripts began to look on the Internet.  Thanks to the employer - they did not stop cooperating with me, but suggested how to do it, after which I diligently studied in practice for a couple of years and adequately assessed my level. <br><br>  <b>For the second time</b> , the year began to be presumptive in the same way in 2006, after I got into the office, where I was full of seams before the layout.  I, all the same, understood, already tried my hardest to impose "divas", eradicated the table layout where it was possible, and even sometimes read articles on the Internet.  Specialist, in general, the highest category with the attached self-conceit. <br><br>  However, fortunately, while working on one project ‚Äúfor the soul‚Äù, I had a chance to meet a colleague from Yekaterinburg, whose knowledge turned out to be so much wider and more qualitative than mine, that all my foolishness was blown away like a wind.  Probably, for about a year I tugged him on difficult questions for me, to which he invariably gave excellent and detailed answers, and I studied, studied and studied again.  <i>Chipmunk - hello and thank you very much again.</i> <br><br>  <b>The third time</b> such a nuisance happened to me closer to the end of the ‚Äúzero‚Äù: he worked as a freelancer, the customer reviews were all very positive, and in some places too enthusiastic, it was really more or less good - for the layout of standard business card sites or online knowledge stores eyes.  Felt on top for a while. <br><br>  Guess what I thought about myself in a couple of months?  That's right, "you are an idiot, Mikhail Konstantinovich."  This time, thanks are worth mentioning the memories of two previous periods, several author blogs, Habru, browser development (‚Äúround corners are not through damn pictures and eight nested blocks, but with one line of CSS ?! Waaaa, what else can you do?‚Äù) . <br><br>  <b>The fourth time</b> I did not intend to make such a mistake, I‚Äôve become wiser.  Of course, by doing something intricate well, I allow myself the thought ‚Äúdamn, I'm cool!‚Äù (And who isn't?).  But she is delayed a maximum until the next morning. <br><br>  The moral of this simple narration is simple and expressed in the subtitle.  If you think that you know in your professional field everything that, in terms of intelligence from those who are now living, you are getting close to Stephen Hawking and Grigory Perelman, that here it is - the limit ... Wake up. <br><br>  <i>0.01% in the title I left to those who are really very cool.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153735/</a></p>
