This conference promises to present a maximum of material for the maximum audience.  Conference sessions (and, judging by the list, 618 is expected) have already been published on the <a href="http://ignite.microsoft.com/">official website</a> .  Let's see together what awaits us at Microsoft Ignite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/850/d35/910/850d359100564da08d7e2c8e42b2772b.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  About the conference </h4><br>  ‚ÄúSpark the Future‚Äù - the organizers of the Microsoft Ignite conference call for this and invite to join them from May 4 to 8, 2015, in order to have the opportunity to discuss the most modern topics of the IT world in one place. <br>  Despite the fact that Microsoft Ignite is being held for the first time, it will bring together the best from such conferences as the Management Summit, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, Project and TechEd (‚ÄúOne Conference to Rule Them All‚Äù).  The list of claimed topics does not doubt this.  The conference will talk about cloud technology and management, productivity, Big Data and the Internet of Things, unified communications, mobility, interaction and much more.  The conference program will include hundreds of sessions, trainings, laboratory work, and the opportunity to pass certification exams will also be provided.  And, of course, Microsoft Ignite is another chance to talk live with leading Microsoft engineers and experts. <br>  The conference audience is also diverse.  Most of the sessions are focused on the technical community - IT pro and developers for enterprises, however, materials for business audiences who may be interested to learn about the constantly changing conditions of the IT world will be presented.

      A brief overview of 618 sessions allows you to highlight those products that will be focused on.  The undisputed leaders are Office 365 and Azure, followed by SharePoint, Windows, Exchange, Windows Server, System Center and Skype for Business. <br><br><h4>  Windows 10 </h4><br>  Windows 10 is undoubtedly one of the main topics of the conference.  From Ignite we are waiting for even more information about the new operating system.  And the description of the conference sessions only warms up these expectations.  In addition to reviewing Windows 10 Enterprise, you will learn how to implement and manage Windows 10 in your organization.  Experts will explain how to prepare your infrastructure for the transition to Windows 10, how Azure AD, Intune and System Center Configuration Manager will help in managing the new infrastructure.  In turn, Microsoft IT will share the experience of transition to Windows 10. <br>  It will also be told about Windows 10 for mobile devices - how to successfully deploy a new operating system, about possible use cases. <br>  We learn about new features for protecting information and combating threats in Windows 10;  what Windows 10 offers for IoT;  the introduction of universal applications for Windows 10 in enterprises and the development of these applications in Visual Studio 2015. <br>  Information about individual products inside Windows 10 and Windows Server Technical Preview is waiting for us, for example, about ‚ÄúProject Spartan‚Äù and about new features of Hyper-V. <br><br><h4>  Cloud technologies </h4><br>  Traditionally, cloud technologies and solutions occupy an important place in the conference theme.  There will be reports that will be devoted to the concept of the Microsoft cloud platform, as well as its individual elements.  They will tell about containers and RemoteApp, about Azure Pack and about building hybrid infrastructure, virtual networks, cloud storages. <br>  Separately, you need to highlight such topics as working with third-party products.  At the conference, there will be reports on the work of virtual machines running Linux in Azure, as well as how to protect virtual machines running on VMware vCenter using Azure Site Recovery. <br>  In labs, participants will be able to build a private cloud using Windows Server and System Center, manage IaaS using Azure Pack and Linux servers, and Exchange Server 2013, SharePoint 2013, SQL Server 2014 using Microsoft System Center 2012 R2. <br><br><h4>  Big data </h4><br>  Not to mention Big Data.  At Ignite there will be sessions devoted to planning Big Data architecture in Azure, real-time analytics using Apache Storm and HBase in HDInsight, analytics using Azure Machine Learning, SQL and R. <br>  There will be reports on SQL Server 2014, its interaction with Azure and System Center. <br>  Participants will also be able to take part in the preparatory sessions for the 70-461 (Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012) and 70-462 (Administering Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Database) certification exams. <br><br><h4>  Skype for Business </h4><br>  One of the main themes of Microsoft Ignite is unified communications.  As part of this topic will be discussed in detail about Skype for Business.  We are waited, first of all, by a large number of review sessions in which they will talk about the product itself and its capabilities, interaction with other products (for example, Office).  It will also discuss the implementation of Skype for Business in the organization. <br>  Developers will be interested to get acquainted with the topic of creating web applications using the Skype Web SDK.  In addition, the theory is not limited to, and will demonstrate ready-made applications and extensions for Skype for Business from Microsoft partners. <br><br><h4>  Developer Topics </h4><br>  I have already mentioned above that Microsoft Ignite is designed for a wide variety of audiences.  Proof of this is a large number of topics dedicated to the development.  It will be about developing business applications, applications for mobile devices, universal applications, etc.  Experts talk about Visual Studio 2015 and ASP.NET 5, AngularJS, NodeJS and Xamarin.  There will also be blocks dedicated to the development of applications for Office 365 and SharePoint.  In addition, there will be talked about various options for customizing your local environment for the effective development of cloud applications and solutions. <br>  Laboratory work is also of interest.  Participants will be able to dive and learn more about the features of the application for Office and SharePoint.  You will be introduced to the Office 365 development platform, SharePoint Hosted Apps.  During the labs, participants will be able to create applications for Windows 10 or write cross-platform mobile applications using Apache Cordova, and all this in Visual Studio 2015. They will also tell about the possibility of improving applications, identifying and solving potential problems using Application Insights. <br><br>  With this, I want to complete a brief overview of Microsoft Ignite sessions.  More details on all sessions can be found on <a href="http://ignite.microsoft.com/Sessions">the conference website</a> .  <a href="http://ignite.microsoft.com/Register">Registration</a> is also available <a href="http://ignite.microsoft.com/Register">on Microsoft Ignite</a> . <br><br>  The list of conference sessions promises interesting content that will be useful to IT professionals, implementation specialists, business representatives and developers.  Two months left before the conference, and we will be able to make sure that Microsoft Ignite was really able to combine all the best from the largest technology conferences. <br><br>  In the meantime, share your opinion on which Microsoft Ignite sessions on which topics would be interesting for you to visit? <br><br><h4>  useful links </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://l.techdays.ru/go/azuretrial">Try Azure</a> for free for 30 days! <br></li><li>  <a href="http://l.techdays.ru/go/mva">Learn</a> Microsoft Virtual Academy <a href="http://l.techdays.ru/go/mva">courses</a> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/how-to-ensure-the-protection-of-data-and-applications-rus">Corporate devices.</a>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/how-to-ensure-the-protection-of-data-and-applications-rus">How to protect data and applications</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/how-to-manage-hybrid-credentials-rus">Corporate devices.</a>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/how-to-manage-hybrid-credentials-rus">How to manage hybrid credentials</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/computer-security-fundamentals-rus">Computer Security Basics</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/building-domain-network-fundamentals-rus">Basics of building a domain network</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/modernization-of-infrastructure-with-windows-server-2012-r2-js-rus">Upgrading the organization's infrastructure using Windows Server 2012 R2</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/licensing-windows-server-2012-r2-rus">Licensing Windows Server 2012 R2</a> </li></ul></li><li>  <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/ru-RU/evalcenter/dn205286">Download a</a> trial version of Windows Server 2012 R2 </li><li>  <a href="http://l.techdays.ru/go/getvs">Download</a> free or trial Visual Studio </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252309/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252309/</a></p>
