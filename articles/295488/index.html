Very often we can find articles on how to monetize your skills using the Internet.  Interest in this topic is growing steadily. <br><br>  Remote work is now becoming an integral part of everyday life, gaining ever more tangible significance every year.  On the territory of the Russian Federation, users do not always understand how to teach themselves.  This is due not only to the lack of example, but also to the inability of individual resources to contribute to this.  For example, platforms that divide users into sellers and buyers (customers / performers) deprive people of a simple choice of offering or buying something being equal opportunity users. <br><br>  Such things as service and mutual respect are hidden somewhere far away and it is not always possible to find them.  You can find resources offering to purchase paid access to your database (or a paid account), which is clearly similar to a scam with a slight degree of absurdity.

      But let's leave aside the resources of this kind and move on to the users. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you have already achieved some success in any field, have experience and practical skills, then you probably realized that the prospects of your work directly depend on how you present yourself on this or that site.  Support for photo and video files, a flexible system of offering services and products (various additional options, bonuses and discounts) - all these features are not a small plus for both the resource and the user. <br><br>  Offering his services, the first thing that should bother the user is how he will look from the outside.  The simple phrase: ‚ÄúHello, my name is Alexey, and thanks for the interest in my gigu *‚Äù - at least indicates that the user is polite and knows where to start. <br><br>  The text of your gig should be readable, language-literate, and important points should be highlighted in bold.  But this does not mean at all that you need to be prim and dull, to follow a certain pattern in the description of your proposal. <br><br>  Say, if you propose a correction using Photoshop, in addition to the portfolio view, specify the file formats with which you work.  The undoubted advantage when working with video is to support the resource of its own video channel, and not a link to Youtube, since in the latter case you will have to upload the video first on Youtube, having first registered there.  Or another example: promising to send a press release to 300 popular news sites and magazines, indicate what kind of resources these are, note that their topics will correspond to the release. <br><br>  It would not be superfluous to mention that an order should be made only after prior approval, and for this the platform should have a communication system with the seller.  Having found an offer that interests me, I always strive to discuss, say, the possibility of delivery or the speed of work, using a system of communication within the site. <br><br>  Try not to lose the stated deadlines for execution, think in advance how much time you will need. <br><br>  Control the number of orders in the queue, do not go for what you can not cope with in the short term. <br><br>  If you are doing everything right, your gig will not be sent for revision, and you will receive funds to the account, plus a positive review almost immediately after the order is completed.  Also to such a coincidence of circumstances will result in communication between you and other users directly in the process of order execution. <br><br>  * GIG / GIG ‚Äã‚Äã- this tag indicates the offer of goods and services on the network, it is synonymous with the word work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295488/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295488/</a></p>
