It helps to write on the back side of the paper so that the marking lines do not dominate in the drawing. <br><br>  - Why do you use such a simple command system in your cars? <br>  - You see, it's all in my memory.  - I can not understand the complex system of commands, it does not fit in my head - complained Cray. <br><br>  Once, a problem occurred with one of the Cray supercomputers.

Engineers called technical support for Cray Computer Corporation. <br>  - We have a problem, on our Cray-1 flew downloader. <br>  - The situation is abnormal - the first time we are faced with such a problem.  Please wait on the line, I'll see what can be done. <br>  ... <br>  - This is a very old model, and we can not now find a bootloader to send it to you.  Please do not worry, I will connect you now to Mr. Kreus. <br>  ‚ÄúAnd how will he help, in fact ...‚Äù <br>  - He will help. <br>  ... <br>  - Seymour Cray is listening. <br>  - Hello Mr. Cray, we lost the bootloader, and in technical support they said that you did not have his code ... <br>  - Write. <br>  - What? <br>  - Take a pen and write.  A0 BF 10 05 ... <br>  Cray dictated 4 kilobytes of the loader from memory. <br><br>  - Mr. Cray, how do you manage to make such fast computers? <br>  - You know, once I spoke with a friend of a physicist.  And he said, ‚Äúyou know, Seymour, every time when stagnation begins in physics, God invents new elementary particles.‚Äù  It seems to me that something similar is happening with supercomputers. <br><br>  - Tell me, Seymour, I saw your Ford in the parking lot - why did you buy this particular car?  I now think what kind of car I should buy, and in no way will I choose ... <br>  - It's simple.  I went to the nearest car dealership, walked over to the nearest seller, pointed my finger at the nearest car, and said: I buy it. <br>  ‚ÄúBut ...‚Äù <br>  - This is the best way, colleague.
