  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Children's fiction with a human face</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/edee2477/3b23c5c6/1b559930/1f5e94ec.jpg" align="left">  Science fiction has long gone out of fashion.  It may be because those happy years have passed, when any literate person could at least approximately navigate modern science and technology, as was the case in Jules Verne‚Äôs time.  Since then, science has gone far ahead.  Or vice versa, 95% of the population has learned to read, but to understand what they read - no.  One way or another, mass culture has gone along the line of least resistance, stamping kilotons of vampires, zombies, pokemons, genetically modified alien robots from the eighth dimension, and other elves with Bakugans and ancient writings. <br><br>  But during this pseudo-and anti-scientific holiday of ignorance there are people who do not want to indulge intellectual laziness.  Science fiction writer Nick Gorkavy (astrophysicist in combination, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences Nikolai Nikolaevich Gorkavy) is not shy in the expressions: ‚Äúspherically symmetric collapse of the Universe‚Äù, ‚Äúbifurcation point‚Äù, ‚Äúhydrodynamic Navier-Stokes equations in partial derivatives‚Äù.  And the plot of his trilogy "Astrovityanka" - the adventures of a teenage girl who, as befits the heroes of children's adventure literature, cracks down on villains just as well as Chuck Norris, saves the world, falls in love ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A mixture of "Harry Potter" and "Children of Captain Grant" generously seasoned with modern scientific theories and words, the meaning of which most teenagers will have to clarify in the encyclopedia - a pleasant and refreshing contrast with the monstrously illiterate "scientific" blunders of popular cinema and paper fiction.  ‚ÄúScience is cool!‚Äù Reads between the lines of his books. <br><br>  A few months ago, the third book about Astrovityanka was published.  I am glad that Gorky has a positive attitude towards the free distribution of his books on the Internet.  According to him, "pirates" only contribute to the growth of sales of the paper version.  Therefore, I, without any remorse, give a <a href="http://lib.rus.ec/a/32311">link to the page of Gorky on Librusek</a> .  Read on health!

    <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/da4e5df1/75c2bb84/bb732594/7092aa80.jpg" align="left">  ‚ÄúThe butterfly was created,‚Äù Nikki said quietly, ‚Äúof two kinds of chemical elements: hydrogen, which arose during the Big Bang and is more than ten billion years old, and carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, which were formed much later - during massive fusion burning stars  At the end of their evolution, these stars exploded as supernovae, and shock waves sprayed in space and threw chemical elements heavier than helium ‚Äî carbon, oxygen, and others ‚Äî into the solar system.  During the outburst of a supernova, the heaviest chemical elements ‚Äî from iron to uranium ‚Äî were formed, which can also be found in the butterfly.  This frivolous insect consists of an ancient foreign substance.  The butterfly carries in itself both the traces of the first minutes of the birth of the universe, and the life and death of many stars ... <br><br>  Professor's thick eyebrows rose higher and higher, and Nikki slowly continued: <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe stars shine during the day, so, besides the young sunlight, which flew in space for eight minutes, the ancient radiation of distant stars simultaneously falls on a butterfly.  This starlight left the photosphere of its luminaries hundreds and thousands of years ago, overcame a huge space and ended its existence on the wings of the Earth butterfly, slightly heating them with ancient heat, possibly already extinct stars.  The color opacity of the butterfly is spectrally conditional.  Cosmic and terrestrial radiation, including gravitational and radio waves, gamma rays and neutrinos, easily penetrate through chitinous armor.  The butterfly quickly flaps its wings and itself turns out to be a source of low-frequency sound and gravitational radiation.  It is located in a curved space-time around the Earth and moves, leaning on the air, thus the flight of a butterfly is a continuous escape from a fall along a geodesic line ... Enough?  Nikki Van Teller asked. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo ...‚Äù the old professor stretched enchantedly, ‚ÄúI would still listen ...‚Äù <br><br>  - Butterfly effectively operates with time and its energy.  According to the consequences of Einstein‚Äôs special theory of relativity, the butterfly and its wings, moving at different spatial speeds, have different speeds of time at each point of the wing and body.  Butterfly muscles, flapping their wings, change the speed of time along the wing.  Air molecules move with the greatest speed in space and with the lowest speed in time.  The result of the collision of air molecules with wing molecules is described in the language of classical physics as pressure or energy transfer, but it is more correct to consider it as the exchange of space-time parameters between atoms.  The fluttering flight of a butterfly is the dancing interplay of personal times and spaces of the butterfly, the gravitational field of the Earth and atmospheric molecules ... Continue?  Nikki asked again. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf you have something to add, then ‚Äî yes,‚Äù Van-Teller said, still interested. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell ... the butterfly is a thermodynamically open, self-organizing system according to Prigogine and has a whole bunch of instabilities, such as Turing instability in environments of diffusing chemical reagents responsible for the formation of structures of the butterfly's body and the pattern on its wings.  The nonlinear propagation of electrical impulses in the nerve cells, the wave instability in the form of intestinal peristalsis, and the formation of solitons in the long chains of protein molecules can be noted.  A butterfly is a metastable object formed by a bunch of structure-forming instabilities.  The butterfly is alive, while unstable - if it gets rid of instability, it will die.  An absolutely stable system is always dead. <br></blockquote><br><br>  PS For the first time I read <a href="http://my-tribune.blogspot.com/">about</a> Gorbav and his books <a href="http://my-tribune.blogspot.com/">in this blog</a> .  There is a lot of tasty - do not be lazy to dig in the archives. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113604/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113604/</a></p>
