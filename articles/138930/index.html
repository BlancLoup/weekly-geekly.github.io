  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Application Developer Days conference will be in May</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://blogs.byte-force.com/xor/images/add-logo-bird.png" alt="Application Developer Days" align="right">  On May 11-12 this year, the third conference of professional programmers <a href="http://addconf.ru/">Application Developer Days</a> (ADD) will be held in Moscow. <br><br>  What you need to know about the conference ADD to those who have not been to it yet?  Firstly, this is a conference about technologies: about programming languages, libraries, tools, architectural solutions and complex projects. <a name="habracut"></a>  There are almost no reports about managing people, about effective methods for manually finding errors, and about ways to convince the customer that there are no errors and everything is going according to plan.  For all the importance of such reports for the industry as a whole, they are boring for a programmer.  Imagine how, in all Agile radiance, you are developing the ATP Dispatcher Workstation on FoxPro ... Definitely, it‚Äôs better not to imagine some things. <br><br>  Secondly, Application Developer Days is, of course, not a conference for everyone.  If you are really developing an AWP on FoxPro, and plan to do this further, then ADD is not your case.  You will be disturbed by reports about incomprehensible languages, such as Erlang, Scala, Kotlin.  Some of them are being developed right now, which is generally beyond reasonable limits.  What for?  Are they missing FoxPro?  Some sort of distributed data warehouse, of course, you will never need.  We don‚Äôt even talk about cloud computing at all - you only have a secretary to the director in ATP.  So it is better to quietly see out until the end of the working day and go home. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Thirdly, ADD is not limited to any single language or development platform.  We are ready to discuss any languages, any platforms, any projects.  No one knows what each of you will have to face tomorrow.  A new challenge may be unexpected, like a bolt from the blue.  And it will need to take, or step aside.  We will teach how to be in the subject and maintain knowledge at the present level. <br><br>  Our world - the world of software development - is constantly changing, and in these conditions, each programmer must make a choice for himself: stop at what has been achieved, close his eyes and rest on his laurels, or keep his ears on top, follow the innovations and try to apply them to his practice.  Someone calmed down, having listened to a course at the institute, that is, in fact, without starting a search, and someone is looking every day.  Conference ADD - for programmers of the second type.  They are much smaller than the first, but the more pleasant it is to gather with them in one place. <br><br>  We invite all real programmers to take part in the conference.  Here you can listen to good reports of smart people and plenty to talk with the brothers in mind.  They will help you in finding a new one.  Because if you just read about everything that appears every day, then you will read all day, and you will not have time to take away even the wheat from the chaff.  At the conference there will be people who have already selected something useful for themselves and enthusiastically tell about it.  There is reason to listen. <br><br>  Section <a href="http://addconf.ru/list.sdf/ru/add_3/reports">"Reports" of</a> the conference site is constantly updated.  Already there are reports about Azure and AWS, about Scala and about the new language Kotlin, about how to draw 2D graphics and about computer vision. <br><br>  If you also have something to tell colleagues, then that's great.  Do you have an unusual, complex, large, interesting project?  Tell me about it!  Do you use a non-standard programming language, a new database, a fresh library?  Share your experience!  Invented a new architectural approach?  Teach! <br><br>  Making a report helps you systematize your own knowledge, and also gives you the opportunity to receive a well-deserved portion of respect from your colleagues.  In addition, the speakers participate in the conference for free. <br><br>  All conference reports are recorded on video, combined with screencasts of presentations and published on the site <a href="http://addconf.ru/">http://addconf.ru/</a> .  We recommend that you familiarize yourself with reports of past years, there is something that is still being discussed.  And your report will also be able to see hundreds and thousands of viewers.  Especially if it is a slaughter. <br><br>  As an example of the widely discussed reports, we suggest watching a video or reading transcripts: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/118088/">Report by Dmitry Zavalishin about Fantom-OS</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/erlang/114560/">Report by Max Lapshin on the development of video hosting on Erlang</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/development/117359/">Report by Vladimir Klimontovich on Apache Hadoop</a> . </li></ul>  <b>But do not forget that no video will replace a living human communication.</b>  <b>We are waiting for you at Application Developer Days!</b> <br><br>  PS Finally, read the review of the habrouser <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/andrey2008/" class="user_link">Andrey2008</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/118673/">about the ADD conference and communication</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138930/</a></p>
