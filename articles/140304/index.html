Many contemptuously relate to this service, so you should explain what is its strength.  The power of Twitter in a good search, in a large number of live, open to communication users and as simple as possible communication scheme.  In addition, it is important to understand the conceptual difference between a search on Twitter and a search on google. <br><br>  The more you understand the logic of his work, the closer the analogy with the work of associative thinking becomes.  But this is not the same philosophy, not the lyrics, so I will explain this comparison in the postscript. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/994/531/4d7/9945314d718066d7e5d85dc7c6a75a34.jpg">  "

      We proceed to practice. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I haven‚Äôt figured out the native interface and mobile apps yet, so I‚Äôll tell you how to use the Chrome extension: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/61f/75a/733/61f75a73346e6978787b4211e20be752.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/encaiiljifbdbjlphpgpiimidegddhic">SilverBird</a> extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/encaiiljifbdbjlphpgpiimidegddhic">is</a> written by Brazilian developer Rafael Car√≠cio, his Twitter is @cezarsa.  This is an open source project, <a href="https://github.com/rafaelcaricio/silver_bird">its code</a> is laid out on GitHub. <br><br>  Instead of the Home tab, which I do not use, I put the ‚ÄúUnified‚Äù tab (‚ÄúCommon‚Äù), the content of which is configured.  It displays the contents of the Home tab, plus @mentions and personal messages (DMs).  As you can see from the screenshot, all other tabs are search queries, which I will discuss in more detail below.  Managing tabs becomes apparent by right-clicking on a tab bar.  For tabs, drag and drop works. <br><br><h4>  Work with search queries </h4><br>  The difference between a Twitter search is that an information flow is often searched for on a given topic, and not an answer to a specific question.  When the stream is found, the request can not be changed for a long time and just follow the information flow.  Extradition is limited to five days from history (restriction introduced recently, I think, because of the high load).  It is easier for me to tell the basic techniques using specific examples of search queries. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>rizzoma OR rizzomacom</b> </li></ul><br>  On Twitter, you can quickly track what they write about your service.  Often users come up with direct questions.  We have the name of the service itself, <a href="http://rizzoma.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dfeed%26utm_campaign%3Dsilverbird">Rizzoma</a> , different from the name of the Twitter account: @rizzomacom.  Therefore, the request has both names. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>#confluence OR wrike OR streamwork OR "cisco quad"</b> </li></ul><br>  My work is closely connected with the tools of the collaboration.  This request allows you to monitor what people are saying about some services that are interesting to me in a given period of time.  I use #hashtag very rarely in requests: recently it was captured by vile spammers or the so-called SocialMediaMarket-lolog (SMM-sci).  Here is the latest <a href="http://www.nevillehobson.com/2012/03/09/twitter-hashtags-spam-magnets/">article about this issue</a> (in English). <br><br><ul><li>  <b>googlewave OR googlewave OR co-meeting OR waveinabox OR WIAB -google + -g + -google plus - # google +</b> </li></ul><br>  I keep track of everything related to Google Wave and Wave‚Äôs successor projects.  This query uses SMM garbage filtering about G +.  The request is supplemented with exceptions for new spam streams. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>kobzevvv OR kravtsovd</b> </li></ul><br>  We often answer questions with a colleague.  I use this query to not duplicate our responses. <br><br>  If you go this way and recruit search queries for yourself, then at some point the extension will start to fail.  This is due to violation of the server limit by the number of requests.  Go to the "Options" and increase the timeouts. <br><br><h4>  Ticket system to work with Twitter </h4><br>  We had an idea to send feedback from Twitter users to the ticket system for accounting and distribution within the team, followed by sending the response back to Twitter.  There are many such services.  We worked with Zendesk for a while.  As a result, they refused - work directly, through the above search queries, is faster and more flexible in settings.  I think this decision may well be suitable for a large team. <br><br><h4>  Russian-speaking segment of Twitter is small </h4><br>  I came to the conclusion that the Russian-speaking segment of Twitter is still too small and is not particularly useful for searching for ‚Äúinteresting things‚Äù.  But the Russian policy in it is Klondike for studying the work of information flows.  To better understand the promotion on Twitter, I recommend to study how Navalny works.  A lot of good tricks and ideas. <br><br><h4>  Facebook and Google Plus are uninteresting for now. </h4><br>  On Facebook, the search interface in public posts is too complicated for regular use.  Many people do not know at all that such functionality is there, and the search itself does not index all public content. <br>  In G +, by itself, the search works much better.  There is even an option to save search queries.  I have not yet found a convenient extension for the lazy ones, which frees them from walking through the pages.  I believe that, so far, a critical mass of an active audience has not been gathered, among the content of which it would be worth doing such a search. <br><br><h4>  PS About Twitter and Neocortex </h4><br>  At the beginning of the article, I compared Twitter with the work of the brain.  I will explain the comparison.  In the cerebral cortex there are two principles of organization of neurons.  One of them is the construction of tree hierarchies.  This principle is described in more detail in the book ‚ÄúOn the Intelligence‚Äù of Jeff Hawkins. <br>  The second principle is horizontal joins.  The fact is that neurons can have completely unexpected connections.  And these connections are constantly being completed and opened.  This behavior of the neurons resembles Twitter user connections (follow).  From this point of view, the limit of 144 characters looks reasonable, because Twitter is more a way of organizing information flows than the information itself. <br>  Anyway, I like this analogy.  Let me remind you that this is only a model, and it can be challenged from a thousand different positions.  I am sure that there are many other interesting analogies. <br><br>  Enjoy all diving in the information flows of global intelligence. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140304/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140304/</a></p>
