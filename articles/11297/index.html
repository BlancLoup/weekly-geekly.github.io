  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Virtual Vacation.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Normal morning: I woke up early, sat down for breakfast and turned on the news.  During the speeches of the presidents, a ‚Äúcontextual‚Äù banner called for engaging in the pre-election race of one of the distant sectors.  Hmm, thanks, don't ... I watch the news in the charts - as always, nothing new.  What is at work? <a name="habracut"></a>  - Five have not returned from vacation in virtual reality ... Fir-trees, I hope, not everyone will have to pull out. <br>  I settle for reclining and enter the portal interface.  Need to work.  Let's start with a more difficult case, for example, a three-day delay, a state employee AG. Trip to the twentieth century, a young "new Russian", cars, girls, riotous life.  - Clear.  How to return it if he is so passionate about the joys of life?  - Unclear.  Include physical inconvenience: a small accident, surgery, bed rest.  Well, he still thinks about the meaning of life, and I can see where he lives "in real life."  I come out of the portal and heading home to the ward, it seems to be close, 10 minutes. Elevator, escalator, another escalator, transfer, elevator to the third level, here is his apartment.  The door is opened by a crying aunt, well, the door will not have to open.  He says the medicine has given, massages the arms and legs all the time, but he does not return.  Hmm, they are watching the vacationer, the body is fine, okay. <br>  - It means, dear, that AG feels the unreality of that world, but does not want to leave, and the subconscious mind keeps it in the game, take note. <br>  And don't worry, I'll get him out in a few hours.  Our service guarantees the return of the client within 24 hours from the time of treatment.  Immersion systems have reached heights thanks to copying the work of the brain.  Nothing convinces the reality of sensations more than a projected stream of thoughts: eat, move one foot, yawn, blink, and so on without stopping.  New thoughts crowd out the old and virtual world takes you into tenacious embraces.  A rest in real life in a clean sector is too expensive for an ordinary employee, and there is no need for it, because the immersion program turns off the sense of reality by 100% and takes it away at any known time and place.  I‚Äôll have to pull this client out of the game, out of his world.  So that I myself do not hang in virtuality, we rely shell with a weak level of hypnosis.  A minimum of sensations is given in the service body - just enough so that I can realistically communicate with the rest, but I also did not forget where I really am.  Even if I forget why I came, the body without internal organs will not exist there for more than a day and I will be thrown into reality with minimal losses.  I connect to the game, cut a pofigistic mood to the client and materialize in his room. <br>  - How do you feel? <br>  - Who are you? <br>  - I came for you, the vacation came to an end, you need to return to reality. <br>  AG is not cut.  We must show him a couple of tricks. <br>  - See the spoon?  It does not exist, I am not here either, and you, too, this world is not real. <br>  I include invisibility in him and in myself.  The client is frightened, baptized, I return his visibility, leave to ripen and leave for reality.  It‚Äôs dangerous to pull out too quickly, you shouldn't disturb other people, so I have to close it from communication.  An accidental vacationer, having learned about the unreality of the world, can subsequently apply for a second rest, and they will fine me.  Immersing him in a dream ... </div>
