  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The second group of learning Java and our news</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In April, the first educational course for Java-programmers started on the educational platform Otus.ru, which will last for five months.  Classes go on as usual in the online format, programmers are trained in groups through webinars and homework.  Projects are as close to real conditions as possible: actual tasks are solved, the bias is made on practical skills.  The teacher of the course - a professional developer and experienced teacher Vitaly Chibrikov - such a combination is not often to be found, the more so it is valuable.  We consider it very important that in the process of learning a student gets the opportunity to work with a professional in his field. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now we pay special attention to the quality control of education, conduct surveys and develop an assessment methodology, simultaneously solving the technical nuances of the process.  It is very important for us to build the most flexible and effective teaching method and to produce specialists of an excellent middle level.  However, we have already stated this before. <br><br>  It is not for nothing that we declare that it is interesting to learn from us, but not easy.  At the end of the first month, a small percentage of students left us.  The dropout of students is inevitable and is a kind of indicator of quality - a successful program cannot receive an equal number of students at the entrance and exit, this fact will speak about the rating of training under such a program.  In most cases, students made a decision about graduation due to lack of sufficient time for study.  Those who have decided to go further, in surveys note the relevance of the material, its novelty and practical benefits, as well as the responsiveness of the teacher.  And for us it is a very important assessment. <br><br>  <b>What's new?</b>

      At this stage, there is a set for the second Java stream, the start of which is scheduled for June 3.  Despite the fact that before the start of classes there are still two weeks, the recruitment of the group is in full swing - we were once again convinced that we are on the right path.  The project‚Äôs geography is quite extensive and interesting: Moscow, San Jose, Kazan, Kiev, Nizhny Novgorod, Stockholm, Vologda, Simferopol, Chelyabinsk, Tallinn, Cheboksary, Krasnodar, St. Petersburg, Saratov, Cherepovets, Ufa, Vladivostok, Orenburg, Kolomna and this is not all the points that are already marked on our map.  Also, the second group is joined by those who did not have time to enroll in the first set, which we undoubtedly welcome.  The number of places in the first course had to be limited, as there were significantly more applicants than could be enrolled in the group without reducing the quality of education. <br><br>  We have planned two Open Doors Days - May 27 and June 1, where we will be happy to answer all the questions of interest and, according to the experience of the first set, play places in the group, as well as discuss training conditions.  Want to take part in the Open Day?  Welcome <a href="http://otus.ru/dod%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Daffilate%26utm_campaign%3Ddod">here</a> . <br><br>  A group was created in Slack, where everyone (not only students - any successfully passed the test user), can get access to the professional community.  The group discusses Java cases, reviews the code, shares useful materials, discusses various solutions to problems, and simply shares experiences and communicates on professional topics. <br><br>  <b>What are your plans?</b> <br><br>  The five best students who completed the course will be invited for interviews with top IT companies.  At the time of the start of the project, among them were Luxoft, ABBYY, IBS, CROC and EPAM, for the first month of work HH, the Laboratory of Cloud Technologies, also became our partners.  And the list of famous companies continues to grow. <br><br>  Another news is that in the near future a new course on Python is being prepared for launch, the selection of candidates for the position of teacher and the coordination of the program of the course have been completed.  The teacher will be Stanislav Stupnikov - programmer of the advertising system in Mail.Ru, in his professional piggy bank 6 years of industrial development experience, including the creation and maintenance of web applications, infrastructure solutions, high-load systems, data pipelines and analytical systems.  3 years of scientific development for large government customers with contracts on the subject of large data analysis.  Programming experience in Python, Go, Lua, C, JavaScript, Perl.  A wide range of professional interests, ranging from building distributed systems to machine learning.  More than 5 years of teaching programming in Python to students of MSTU.  N.E.  Bauman.  4 years of teaching a DBMS course at Mail.Ru Technopark  He graduated from MSTU.  N.E.  Bauman on the specialty "Information Security Specialist" in 2013. <br><br>  And even on this we do not plan to stop.  In the foreseeable future, it is planned to launch the courses ‚ÄúInformation Security‚Äù, ‚ÄúDeveloper C ++‚Äù, ‚ÄúDevops‚Äù and ‚ÄúFrontend Developer‚Äù, but more on this later. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328856/</a></p>
