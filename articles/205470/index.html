  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Green eyed internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The expression "green-eyed taxi" came from the fact that free cars are often denoted by the included green flashlight.  In the new LTE / Wi-Fi mobile router MegaFon MR100-2 green light means a working Internet and ongoing data transfer.  I will tell you about the capabilities of this router and once again about the MegaFon LTE network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/876/8e0/879/8768e08793a23e8d7d83196f4994ddb1.png"><br>  <i>Internet is enough for everyone</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Application </h4><br>  New opportunities generate new needs - this is the driving mechanism for progress.  The proliferation of mobile Internet leads to the fact that it is required by an increasing number of people - and devices.  In principle, the function of the access point is in smartphones, but the issue of battery consumption has not been canceled.  So, to provide the Internet with a small fleet of devices somewhere far from a wire, a mobile router remains a popular solution. <br><br>  MegaFon MR100-2 can work as: <br><ul><li>  LTE modem for laptop, computer and any other device with USB port </li><li>  Wi-Fi router for private network </li><li>  Wi-Fi router for open network </li></ul><br>  - in the MegaFon network, distributing Wi-Fi to 10 devices.  The built-in battery of the router with a capacity of 2100 mAh (larger than that of some smartphones) makes it a completely autonomous device.  The MR100-2 lies in a pocket, in a backpack, on a windowsill, in a car glove compartment or in a desk drawer, flashes with a green eye - and does its job.

    <h4>  Design </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c53/095/98b/c5309598b32350d6ad52cb39378c5ad7.png"><br><br>  <i>In addition to the router in a small box, only the user manual is quite compact, completely in Russian and, importantly, useful.</i>  <i>However, after reading this post, there is no need to look in anymore;)</i> <br><br>  The gadget itself is small and elegant;  its dimensions - 97x66x13 mm - are very close to the dimensions of an average 2.5-inch HDD.  It weighs only 99 g. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d93/8c9/c4d/d938c9c4d74ad0b331a2afad286c5231.png"><br><br>  The body is made of smooth plastic.  The upper end of the gadget is given under the e-ink display, showing the network mode and battery charge, and the mode switch button.  The red dot under the button cuts through. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2b/229/1d6/b2b2291d613613cf33e5d32e5ea2f36e.png"><br><br>  The MR100-2 supports two Wi-Fi modes ‚Äî a private network and a private network + open network, switched by a button at the top.  Position in the center - off, to the left - a private network, to the right - open.  In the second case, the Wi-Fi devices around will see two networks: private, as you call it when creating a password, and MegaFon Free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d16/3cb/6f2/d163cb6f25e00e0adb4ed5ba3a17747b.png"><br><br>  At the bottom of the case - a retractable USB connector.  More precisely, it is not just a connector, but 3-in-1: it is a SIM card slot, it is also combined with a microUSB port on the reverse side, and also hides access to the microSIM connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8f/84d/48c/f8f84d48ceb211f4624d26dacb49a53d.gif"><br><br>  Front - illuminated inscription 4G MegaFon: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/798/055/f20/798055f20acb8366f81065c58d92689a.png"><br><br>  Behind - nothing but a sticker with information that is worth remembering and ungluing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df8/e82/8ec/df8e828ecbec28a6c6af3bc124fad91c.png"><br><br><h4>  Beginning of work </h4><br>  The router is already sold with microSIM and 2 weeks of free 4G Internet.  Then you will need to choose a package <a href="http://moscow.megafon.ru/internet/">with the desired amount of traffic</a> . <br><br>  - Insert the SIM-card to the characteristic click lock.  To remove it - you need to press it with your fingernail until the ejector spring triggers.  However, it can be difficult to pull it out with bare hands, but it will save any object at hand. <br>  - The battery must be charged. <br>  - Press the power button, choosing one of two modes of distribution of Wi-Fi: in a closed or open network - and you are on the Internet. <br><br>  Like any new device, it is desirable to customize the router after switching on.  From a smartphone / tablet that caught Wi-Fi from a router or laptop you need to go to <a href="http://status.megafon.ru/">status.megafon.ru</a> .  Wi-Fi mobile device is caught immediately, because  By default, both Wi-Fi modes are non-password protected.  It is logical that for the private network mode it is better to quickly set the password: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/706/d1d/4d2/706d1d4d209248687db67d7b43f19f46.png"><br><br>  We also decide whether we need foreign roaming through this router, which network mode we prefer, whether we need a logo backlight and the ability to see the current battery level - which is especially convenient when the router is somewhere far away. <br><br>  Then you should go to megafon.ru - at the top of the page you will see the phone number and account balance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8c/1d3/736/c8c1d37360c2f416cacd7904759dba68.jpg"><br><br>  Here, after 2 weeks of free Internet, you can choose the appropriate amount of Internet for a month and replenish the balance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8bf/870/142/8bf870142f419717a3d5014f0c9fa13a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Networking </h4><br>  I have already tested LTE MegaFon in Moscow recently on the new iPad Air.  MegaFon MR100-2 just confirmed the quality of the network: at the height of the working day at Tula 42 megabits - this is very decent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/283/7ae/38f/2837ae38f0226d0cbcebd5d87944babd.jpg"><br><br>  It's funny that the router and ipad see LTE MegaFon better than my Xperia - the usual mobile network.  However, here it is possible, the matter is already in the gadget, and not as a network. <br><br>  A battery is also an important advantage of a separate router over a smartphone distributing a network.  MegaFon says that one of the tasks in developing a new router was to find a solution to ensure the longest battery life.  Compared with the previous model MR100-1 battery capacity increased by 50%, reaching 2100 mAh.  The battery consumption occurs only in the data transfer mode (when the green light is flashing), therefore, in general, the gadget's operation time is very high: in the working mode (more reading Habr and other sites, working with mail without downloading heavy files), the router lasts 12 hours and above, the minimum device operation time is 5 hours in continuous download mode.  On average, it turns out that with equal use mode, the router works 2-3 times longer than a smartphone that distributes the Internet.  This is enough to ensure the whole working day of a small company in the open air. <br><br><h4>  Additional features </h4><br>  In addition to controlling the functions of the router, the <a href="http://status.megafon.ru/">status.megafon.ru</a> page allows you to use it in a quasi-telephone mode - for example, send USSD requests (balance, option management), send / receive SMS, determine the phone number of the SIM used. <br><br>  All these functions are available only in the mode of connection via USB or via a private Wi-Fi network.  Those who are connected to an open network (Wi-Fi free mode) will not be able to get to the status.megafon.ru page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41c/7e8/9cb/41c7e89cbf55f45b4855fdec3f2c9d5b.png"><br><br>  You can purchase a router in the MegaFon online store in <a href="http://moscow.shop.megafon.ru/modems_g__g_33_tree_1008_82759.html">black</a> (like our test device) and in <a href="http://moscow.shop.megafon.ru/modems_g__g_33_tree_1008_83412.html">white</a> colors at a price of 4900 rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205470/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205470/</a></p>
