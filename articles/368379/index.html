  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is Google doing in the financial technology market?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2b/59b/cf8/f2b59bcf8adf49bba36d390bed7a7f79.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  As financial technologies spread to new industries, information technology companies are beginning to realize that now it‚Äôs time for them to enter the game in order to fully enjoy the benefits of innovation and remain competitive.  Of course, technology companies are directly interested in fintech-development, allowing them to significantly reduce costs and optimize operations.  And if the entry into the game of traditional players in the financial industry is quite expected, the big technology companies, on the contrary, do not seek to advertise their "intrigues" in the fintech market. <br><br>  We already know about one dark horse on the market - Microsoft - and a wide range of its FINTECH initiatives, as well as significant company advancement in working with the blockchain.  But there is another good example - Google, although it is not as active in the blockchain sphere.  For us at <a href="https://wirexapp.com/">Wirex</a> , a Fintech startup providing payment and remittance services without banking intermediation, the list of companies invested by Google in this article seems to be very interesting and worthy of attention.  So welcome under cat.  The post was prepared on the basis of <a href="http://letstalkpayments.com/what-is-google-doing-in-fintech/">LTP</a> materials. <a href="http://letstalkpayments.com/what-is-google-doing-in-fintech/">After</a> reading it, you will see that very soon the banks may face open and tough competition from many other players. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, the first thing that comes to mind at the mention of Google and fintech is Android Pay.  However, today we will focus on Google‚Äôs venture capital investment in financial technology, which the company implements using <a href="http://www.gv.com/">Google Ventures</a> , which has already received the status of one of the ‚Äúcoolest‚Äù fintech investors in the United States. <br><br>  Google Ventures is the investment division of Google, through which the company searches for startups from many different industries to invest in them.  Google Ventures recently went through a rebranding, changing its name to GV and turning its color, made in the visual style of the parent company logo on a modern black and white.  As a rule, Android Pay is the only Google fintech initiative that we hear about, but the GV already today has an interesting and deserving closer examination of the investment portfolio.

Most of them (43%) are consumer services companies.  They are followed by corporate solutions, which occupy 29% of the portfolio.  But the most interesting are investments in fintech startups.  Venture businesses operating in the financial technology market account for about 13% of the total amount of invested funds distributed unevenly across different segments of the FINTECH market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/623/1dd/aff/6231ddaff4b84bbdacedfc84bc9367de.png" alt="image"><br><br>  GV Portfolio contains a number of interesting FINTECH startups working on authentication tools, security, API for banking services, cryptocurrency, lending, payment technologies and other areas.  Healthcare technologies are represented by several interesting startups, including <a href="https://www.hioscar.com/">Oscar</a> .  As for the blockchain technology, then the venture company cannot be called generous in this relationship: the GV portfolio is represented by only one company working with the sensational technology - Ripple Labs.  Lending and payment technologies, by contrast, are represented by quite a large number of companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5d/286/375/f5d2863753c540739203f2443b7ac21f.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  25% of fintech portfolio is occupied by ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù - single companies working on authentication technologies, blockchain, digital currencies and other areas.  It is curious that analytical companies are most in demand with GV investment partners.  Start-up groups that specialize in providing security and personal savings tools (shopping, budget management, control over personal finances) have 13% each. <br><br>  And now let's take a closer look at some of the fintech companies that GV works with. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.corduro.com/">Corduro</a> offers a wide range of payment services for online transactions, mobile and traditional retail operations. <br><br>  <a href="https://rally.org/">Rally</a> is a social fundraising tool that allows you to create your own Internet project and gather an online community around it. <br><br>  <a href="https://ripple.com/">Ripple Labs</a> is a company working to reduce the cost of all types of payments.

The startup intends to quote option contracts for digital currencies. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kensho.com/">Kensho</a> - offers professionals in the field of finance and economics special software for market research. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.lendup.com/">LendUp</a> - is an improved version of the loans "to paycheck."  LendUp purposefully issues loans only online or through mobile devices, offering a convenient, fast and easy alternative to traditional microcredit. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.upstart.com/">Upstart</a> is an online lending platform that determines the borrower's solvency on the basis of not only a credit rating, but also indicators such as attending educational institutions, academic performance, work specialization, and employment history.  The internal solvency assessment system determines the most high-quality borrowers despite their limited credit rating or limited work experience. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.shapesecurity.com/product/technology.html">Shape Security</a> - works on new types of web security products, rethinking the economic factors of cybersecurity. <br><br>  <a href="https://jet.com/">Jet</a> is an online consumer club that allows its customers to access the lowest prices in the network of retail partners by working to find the optimal combination of different retail chains based on the contents of the order. <br><br>  <a href="https://duo.com/">Duo Security</a> is a proven provider of a full range of two-factor authentication solutions. <br><br>  <a href="https://digit.co/">Digit</a> - offers automation services for saving personal funds, analyzing the nature of the user's expenses and sending a small amount to his savings account every week. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.inventure.com/">InVenture</a> - helps people from developing countries who do not have access to formal financial identification get access to loan capital and analytical tools for doing business using mobile and Internet technologies. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.abacus.com/">Abacus</a> - provides an easy way to manage your business expenses.

Judging by the structure of the fintech portfolio, GV has a great interest in payment and credit start-ups, as well as developers of analytical tools.  Nevertheless, the GV CEO encourages diversity: <br><br><blockquote>  I asked our team to ignore the precedents and the pressure they experience in the course of their work.  Our goal was simply to find the best ways to help companies succeed. </blockquote><br>  See you in the blog Wirex.
