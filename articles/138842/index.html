  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ranking pages by importance for the online store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is some design experience, and the implementation of online stores that we decided to summarize.  We were surprised by the conclusions about the importance of sections in the online store, but took note of them.  In each new project we go through this list and in that order.  We explain to the customer why we should start with the description of the ‚Äúaudience‚Äù, and not from the ‚Äúmain page‚Äù of the site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Catalog page </h5><br>  If the target audience chooses and compares a lot, then this page is the most important in your store (It works in segments where the buyer is not an expert on the product and where a wide range of products: household appliances, jewelry, clothing, electronics).  The page should provide maximum functionality for the right choice.  Intuitive filters must be presented.  Filters should work quickly under difficult conditions and on large amounts of data.  Now the general trend is the use of filtering after adding each new condition to the filter with AJAX processing.  But this is not always convenient, since on large volumes of the nomenclature there will be delays, and often the buyer knows exactly what he wants, enters a lot of parameters and wants to get the result after all the criteria have been specified.  A very important tool after filters is the sorting mechanism.  The minimum that should be is sorting by price.  They often do a lot of sorting by popularity and bestsellers, but, in my opinion, it now works where the audience doesn‚Äôt know exactly what it wants and relies on the majority opinion (‚ÄúAdvise me ...‚Äù): it‚Äôs very typical for women‚Äôs goods, booksellers .  Each product should be presented simply a photo + name + price + buy + compare, but also its competitive advantages, as a last resort, key characteristics.  The main purpose of this page is to generate trust, pleasant emotions from use and transfer the visitor to a detailed page.  ~ 1% of cases who add items to the cart from the catalog page. <br><br><h5>  Product page </h5><br>  The most important page, if your audience knows exactly what it wants, and also if the audience is diverse: from novice users who are afraid to buy on the Internet, to professional users of the goods sold.  The audience needs to be convinced to buy here from you. <br>  Purchase with the order in 99% of cases comes from a detailed page, so the requirements for it are the most stringent. <br><ol><li>  This product must be submitted high-quality photos, they should be enough.  Photos should represent the product with the best hand.  Online stores are very inferior to the real in this regard - here you can not touch the goods, so the photos must be of the best quality to compensate for the lack of the ability to "touch the goods." </li><li>  If the product has video footage, this is another huge plus. </li><li>  It is necessary to correctly show the price - as I said, for this you need to know the audience - to whom we sell.  It's all on the conclusions and experiments there are no uniform rules.  Someone needs to show the price of large + crossed out, someone is petty and unobtrusive, if the price for the audience is not the decisive factor. </li><li>  You need to correctly show the "Buy" button on the same principles as the price. </li><li>  What is important is the unit characteristics of the product and description.  Not so important block to give him the best place, so it‚Äôs better to show the first few, and the rest only on demand. </li><li>  The ‚ÄúCompare‚Äù service is important, but it should be used only for the goods being compared, I also note that it is better to compare in the catalog, and if the visitor has already arrived at the detailed page, he needs to sell. <br></li><li>  Now everyone loves to put the services "evaluation" and "reviews" which in life are always despondently empty with the statistics "There are no reviews for the product yet", "The number of votes is 0".  These services are really needed, but if there is a community at least&gt; 4000 </li><li>  For the goods the information must be available "guarantee", "delivery conditions", "conditions of return" - this is important but it should be shown unobtrusively, only if the visitor needs it, he should easily find it, but no more. </li><li>  This service should be in second place in importance.  Services "UpSell" or "DownSell".  But I will tell about it in one of the following releases.  Who wants faster, <a href="http://eepurl.com/ipB-Y">look here</a> <br></li><li>  Widgets of social networks also like to put everything.  If there is no attendance, then there is little point. </li><li>  Service "similar products."  A very important and necessary service, if only there is information about the quantity of goods - for example, there is no product, and if a similar product is presented adequately - now, in many stores, it feels like the choice is made by a random number generator. <br></li></ol><br><br><h5>  Basket </h5><br>  Important page, mistakes are expensive here.  The main goals are: ‚Äúto place an order‚Äù, ‚Äúnot to let the buyer get distracted‚Äù, if he has failed, then ‚Äúto get some contacts‚Äù.  Under the basket, you need to make a separate template, ideally - so that it does not have a cap and a footer, so that there is not a single link, except for ‚Äújust forward to the design‚Äù.  Your cart must contain: <br><ol><li>  Selected products are presented: name, photos, price of each product, quantity, amount </li><li>  Discounts </li><li>  the total amount of the order </li><li>  Optionally, but now it works very well: loan conditions and calculator for calculating monthly payments </li><li>  Most importantly: the basket is the best place for UpSell.  If you show here, for example: ‚ÄúOnly now complete with what you are buying, you can buy goods XXX with X% discount‚Äù - you will be surprised at the conversion.  This is the simplest example, the most interesting, if you are interested, write in a personal. <br></li><li>  In the basket it is very useful to duplicate information: "warranty", "delivery terms", "return terms" </li><li>  The function of deleting an item‚Äôs position from the basket is important, it is often forgotten about it and in order to delete it is necessary to put the quantity ‚Äú0‚Äù </li></ol>

    <h5>  Checkout </h5><br>  The most important page, errors here, are catastrophic.  According to the specifics, the buyer is required to take action to enter data: name, e-mail, etc.  People do not want to type, scribble down the screen to find out: ‚ÄúHow many fields are there in general ...?‚Äù And the main thing here is not to show all the fields at once, to make the input natural, not to enter what is not necessary based on the previously entered (for example, if payment only cash, then delivery is only self-pickup, and you will not need to know the address anymore. There are quite a few such relationships and all of them need to be worked through).  Slip the field as needed, and only those without which nothing. <br><ol><li>  Full name - or better just a name </li><li>  e-mail, phone - one thing </li><li>  payment method </li><li>  delivery method </li><li>  delivery address </li><li>  comments </li></ol><br>  All the time of registration, you need to show the composition of the basket and the ability to add UpSell or delete what is already there. <br><br><h5>  Home page </h5><br>  The page is not of first importance.  Strange conclusion, right?  However it is.  Shops are not branded or image sites.  The traffic basically ‚Äúlands‚Äù on detailed pages and pages of the catalog.  Such is the specificity of the current time.  Everyone buys context, SEO and landing a dear visitor to the home is meaningless. <br><br><h5>  findings </h5><br>  Perhaps I am not right about our page ranking in order of importance for an online store, but in reality it turns out like this. <br>  I emphasize that this assessment of the composition and importance of the components is given specifically for an online store focused on high conversion and sales. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138842/</a></p>
