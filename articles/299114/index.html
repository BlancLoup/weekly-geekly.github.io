  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gamification in business - a new direction in marketing on the example of case studies of companies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Gamification is a new business concept that helps attract and retain customers.  It uses the best ideas from loyalty programs, game mechanics and behavioral economics.  The task of the marketer is to attract the user's attention and make him spend as much time as possible on the site or in the application.  Entrepreneurs are constantly looking for new ways to attract customers: the classic tricks are losing their popularity. <br><br>  Also, gamification is suitable as a source of new income.  The more time a person spends on the site, the more advertising he will see.  Consequently, it is more likely to purchase a product or service.  The use of new mechanics requires less cost than the classic.  In addition, services for setting targeted advertising lose their effectiveness.  One of the operating mechanisms is word of mouth and competitions of a competitive nature. <br><br>  One of the new and increasingly popular ways to gamify businesses is quests.  We remembered which quests created brands to grow our business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>MTS RED QUEST</b> <br>  According to the legend of the game, the future of the Earth is in danger.  Performing tasks and earning points in the game, the participants.  During the quest, the participants are immersed in its history and mythology.  In addition, users will learn about special offers from MTS, and by connecting tariffs and using its options, they receive additional points in the game. <br>  In less than two months, Red Quest visited more than 3.5 million unique users, and over 1 million participants registered in the game.  The recognizability of the tariff plan has grown to 83%.  In the period of the promotion, the sales of the tariff increased by 20%, and the level of the outflow from the tariff decreased by 15%.

The task involved the active use of bank cards.  In total, the game had seven tasks.  The first task was received by all owners of the cards selected by the bank.  After completing the task, the client received an SMS with the description of the next task.  The more difficult the task was, the more bonuses the client received.  The last task: "Pay with your card in Sochi for 10,000 rubles or more." <br>  More than 15 thousand bank customers took part in the quest, 444 participants completed all seven tasks.

With the help of the application, the child searched and scanned the subjects necessary for the study on the quests of the quests in order to prepare the character for school.  Having coped with the quest, the children received a mini-set of lines LEGO. <br>  In the first days of the project, more than 200 children took part, more than a hundred participants completed the quest and received kits from LEGO.  The participants actively shared photos with the characters, created videos and uploaded information about the action to social networks. <br><br>  <b>Online service for creating and passing quests</b> <br>  We also believe in this direction and therefore we continue to work on creating an online service <a href="http://surprizeme.ru/">Surprise Me</a> , where anyone can create and complete quests: choose a ready-made script or create your own.  We plan to develop in the direction of b2b, so that companies can easily and quickly create quests for large promotions and events. <br><br>  Now the project is almost ready to start, we are at the testing stage.  In honor of March 8, we created mass quests for St. Petersburg and Moscow, with the help of which we just test application functionality and get feedback, which is very important to us! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> For all those who are not indifferent, I propose to write in the case studies and examples that you have encountered or read about them.  Let's expand the list together! <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> We invite everyone to test our quest builder for free.
