It is known that this operating system is more often used on servers than on user computers.  Thus, the goals pursued by cybercriminals in attacks on Linux, have their own specifics, different from the usual attacks on Windows-based systems. <br><br>  In the first part, we will talk about Linux / SSHDoor.A, a threat that is used by attackers to gain hidden access to a compromised server and to steal information.  The second part of the material is devoted to the investigation of attacks conducted on Linux servers that use Apache as a web server. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2be/b39/38d/2beb3938d7fc2c5ee573581373ee3ffa.png">

      <b>Linux / SSHDoor.A</b> <br><br>  Recently, an interesting sample for analysis was submitted to our anti-virus laboratory.  It is a malicious version of the SSH daemon for Linux.  This daemon contains the backdoor functionality and allows attackers to access the compromised server. <br><br>  Recall that the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a very popular protocol used for secure data exchange.  It is widely used in the Unix world for file transfer, management of remote servers, etc. The modified SSH daemon described here is <b>designed to steal user names and passwords, and also allows access to the server</b> through either a hard-coded password or via a special SSH key. <br><br>  Strings that compromise a legal binary file, thereby allowing it to detect its secretive or malicious behavior, are encrypted using the usual XOR algorithm.  We found 16 such lines.  The figure below shows the part of the code responsible for decrypting this hidden data (using the constant 0x23 to decrypt). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/627/765/2db/6277652db4bae2888d46cfa6a66a7c59.png"><br>  Fig.  The code for the decrypter of the strings that the malicious code uses. <br><br>  The HTTP protocol is used to send stolen data to a remote server.  The data is encrypted using a 1024-bit RSA key, which is stored in a binary file, then encrypted again using Base64 and sent to the server via an HTTP POST request. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef5/a38/c42/ef5a38c421d7a3ec1421a78d86021e23.png"><br>  Fig.  An example of a POST HTTP request, through which stolen data is sent to the server. <br><br>  The binary file that we analyzed contains two domain addresses of servers used for data collection: openssh.info, linuxrepository.org.  Probably, both of these names were chosen specifically to avoid suspicion on the part of administrators of compromised servers.  At the time of analysis, these names pointed to the server located in Iceland with IP 82.221.99.69. <br><br>  When the daemon is running, the malicious code sends to the remote server the IP address and port number under which it runs, as well as the host name of the server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fc/132/974/9fc132974a110a7d6fadfcddc27f03d6.png"><br>  Fig.  Backdoor service data. <br><br>  Whenever a user successfully logs on to a hacked server, the username and password are also sent to the remote server.  In addition to identity theft, the backdoor provides the attacker with control over the compromised server in two different ways.  First, it has a hard-wired password embedded in the code.  If a user tries to log in using this password, he automatically gains access to the compromised server.  The figure below shows the code that is responsible for comparing the passwords between the wired code and the one that the user typed when trying to log in. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/efb/bb5/688/efbbb5688b4f85835d129d6c8ef3a615.png"><br>  Fig.  Malicious password comparison code. <br><br>  Secondly, the modified binary file contains an SSH key.  If a user logs on to the server using a private key corresponding to the public key embedded in the code of the threat file, access is automatically granted. <br><br>  The backdoor can also receive configuration data from the /var/run/.options file.  If such a file exists, the malicious code uses the host name, password and SSH key stored in this file. <br><br>  <b>Linux attack using Linux / Chapro.A</b> <br><br>  Below we describe the attack on Linux servers that use the Apache web server (more than half of those in the network).  We were seriously worried about finding a specialized Apache malware module.  <b>This module is used to embed malicious content into web pages</b> displayed by a compromised web server.  We also found that this <b>malicious code was used in a scheme to steal confidential data related to credit cards and online banking</b> . <br><br>  The analyzed Apache malware module was added by us as Linux / Chapro.A.  Its main task is to introduce malicious content into web pages that are managed by this compromised server.  The study revealed that through the introduction of a special iframe, attackers redirect the user to a hidden installation of one of the modifications of the famous Win32 / Zbot banking trojan, which is usually used to steal banking secret information from infected machines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/90e/a74/323/90ea7432387c774b44ce48d22f9371fe.png"><br>  Fig.  Diagram of an attack using Linux / Chapro.A. <br><br>  We also found that this module has a number of interesting features that successfully hide it from system administrators.  In addition to analyzing this malicious Apache module, we will present an analysis of the malicious content that it was implementing, and an overview of the main payload, the Win32 / Zbot trojan. <br><br>  <b>Linux / Chapro.A webpage infector</b> <br><br>  Malicious code is a special Apache module - x64 binary file.  It uses the obfuscation technique of its strings using the XOR-algorithm and a 12-byte key.  It also contains a number of features aimed at hiding its presence from system administrators - for this, the module performs a series of checks before sending the web page with malicious content to the user. <br><br>  First, the browser user agent is checked for the presence of well-known bots and browsers that are not vulnerable to the exploit kit used to infect the client system.  If the client browser that accesses this web page has a user agent recognized by the malicious code as a web crawler, then the malicious content (iframe) is hidden from the client. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b6/725/539/7b6725539c46c52afd5ddd9f4b074d16.png"><br>  Fig.  List of user agents from which malicious code hides embedded content. <br><br>  Secondly, Linux / Chapro.A checks all active SSH sessions on the Linux system on which it is running in order to determine the IP addresses involved in this connection.  If a visitor views a page from a system that has an IP address from the list of SSH connections, it will also not redirect the client to malicious content.  This technique helps to hide this content from system administrators or web developers who could work on this web server. <br><br>  Thirdly, before embedding a malicious iframe into the contents of a Linux / Chapro.A web page, it sets a cookie (cookie) in the client‚Äôs web browser environment.  Malicious content will not be transmitted to the client if the client browser already contains similar cookies.  With this approach, the same visitor will not receive malicious content every time you access the web server, which also complicates the investigation of the causes and methods of infection. <br><br>  And finally, fourth, Linux / Chapro.A stores a list of IP addresses that have already received malicious content.  If a user visits an infected website twice from the same IP address, he will receive such content only once.  It also creates additional difficulties to identify the causes of infection of the client. <br><br>  <b>Injected using Linux / Chapro.A content</b> <br><br>  As we mentioned, the main task of Linux / Chapro.A is to embed malicious iframes into web pages served by the Apache web server.  To receive such an iframe, the malware sends an HTTP POST request to its command C &amp; C server at intervals of 10 minutes.  The following figure shows one of these requests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71f/431/887/71f4318870522cd736035806d3fbb2f6.png"><br>  Fig.  Request for C &amp; C server by Linux / Chapro.A. <br><br>  At the time of our analysis, this C &amp; C was located in Germany.  The request sent to the server is quite simple and includes the version of the malicious program, as well as the version of the OS in which it runs.  The command server responds to these requests with an iframe transfer, which must be implemented using the malicious Apache module.  This transmitted iframe is encrypted using base64 and XOR.  If the visitor of the compromised server does not fall under one of the lists that we talked about in the previous section, he gets a copy of the web page with an embedded iframe that was downloaded from the C &amp; C server. <br><br>  The figure below shows the HTML code for the iframe that compromises a web page.  What is interesting, in order to avoid the attention of the user, this malicious iframe is located outside the area displayed by the browser. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2af/97c/ac7/2af97cac7b7e4f6b5164e5dc59c189ac.png"><br>  Fig.  Malicious iframe. <br><br>  <b>A set of exploits used in the attack.</b> <br><br>  In the course of our analysis, we found that the iframe, which is implemented using Linux / Chapro.A, redirects the user to the ‚ÄúSweet Orange‚Äù exploit set.  At the time of our analysis, the page (server) that contained this exploit pack (landing page) was located in Lithuania.  These exploits are trying to exploit the following vulnerabilities in modern browsers and plugins: <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi%3Fname%3DCVE-2012-5076">CVE-2012-5076: Java JAX-WS Class Handling</a> <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi%3Fname%3DCVE-2012-4681">CVE-2012-4681: Java getField Method Class Invocation Privilege Escalation</a> <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi%3Fname%3DCVE-2006-0003">CVE-2006-0003: Internet Explorer MDAC</a> <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi%3Fname%3DCVE-2010-0188">CVE-2010-0188: Adobe Reader LibTiff Integer Overflow</a> <br><br>  If an exploit kit has the ability to exploit one of these vulnerabilities, it executes a malicious payload on the victim‚Äôs machine. <br><br>  <b>Attack payload</b> <br><br>  The ultimate goal of the attack is to install one of the modifications of the Win32 / Zbot banking Trojan (commonly known as Zeus).  In our case, Win32 / Zbot targets European and Russian banking institutions.  The screenshot below shows the form used by one of the banks to provide customers with online access to a bank account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02f/4ee/af1/02f4eeaf1463d7a51c9d1fe3847dc00f.png"><br>  Fig.  The original web form used to log in to the online banking system. <br><br>  As we see, the banking system warns the user that the online banking system will never request additional, strictly confidential information in the form of a PIN code, CVC / CVV code or other data directly related to the bank card and belonging only to its owner .  However, when a user visits this page from a computer infected with Zeus, this warning is successfully removed from the displayed form.  The screenshot below shows just such a case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55f/5fc/a43/55f5fca430ff3a09a412084d29168e96.png"><br>  Fig.  Web form on a compromised web page that does not contain additional warnings for the user. <br><br>  Once the user successfully logs into the banking system under his account, the malicious code displays a pop-up window, in which he will be asked to enter the CVV code of the card.  Just about the inadmissibility of this and warns the information in the original, not compromised web form.  Next, the malicious code will try to send the credentials of the user and his CVV to attackers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4a/ef5/529/f4aef5529795d04a0e2ef42a4f35ed34.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169297/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169297/</a></p>
