  <section class="page js-page"><h1>According to the technical task</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good evening, the creative part of Habr! <br><br>  As a developer, I constantly work with technical specifications of clients and my first post is a small essay, an analysis of such a thing as ‚Äútechnical task‚Äù. <br><br>  So, when the company-customer comes to the contractor and orders ‚Äúintangible something‚Äù, the latter makes a lean look and asks for a technical task (brief, description, specification).  An enthusiastic customer begins to splash it on paper and this is a good start, because the <strong>technical task is a wonderful thing!</strong>

With the help of those.  tasks we can organize thoughts, correctly set the task and see the contradictions at the earliest stages.  Despite the fact that the term itself is more often used in business, its essence extends to almost all aspects of our life.  Formulated in one way or another, those.  the task from time immemorial serves people to convey information about their needs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In everyday life, we constantly feel its usefulness: ordering a chocolate cake, describing the perfect hairstyle to a hairdresser or choosing a wife who should be cute, witty and able to cook.  The widespread use has generated countless ready-made, typical technical tasks.  For example, in a coffee shop it is enough for us to say ‚ÄúCappuccino!‚Äù And not to tell the waiter about ‚Äúan espresso-based coffee drink with the addition of milk and foam‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e5/770/445/1e5770445a5a499cc7ffc94f3bf77a33.jpg"><br><br>  The only pity is that, full of undeniable advantages, Tech.  The task contains a pair of large and fat "but." <br><br>  Giving an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat the <strong>product will do</strong> , the technical task is completely incapable of describing <strong>how well it will do it</strong> .  Even the most detailed TZ contains a lot of places for free interpretation - places that the performer often interprets in the direction of decreasing efforts. <br><br>  Take, for example, a roll of toilet paper.  The simplest object with an elementary technical task and understandable to every functional.  However, on the shelf of the supermarket you can find completely different paper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/932/939/5d3/9329395d361c0cc360c42b1f8c4ee8c4.jpg"><br><br>  One will be dirty-gray, another - snow-white;  one is worth a dollar, the other is three times more expensive!  Choosing one - you earn hemorrhoids, choosing another - you will reach unprecedented heights of thought. <br><br>  Moving from household examples to business, you can look at the tender purchases.  System based on those.  specifications and the natural desire of business to save money, literally squeezes out good suppliers, reducing trades exclusively to price competition. <br><br>  As a result, the failure of those.  tasks as a quality regulator of work, coupled with the cheapest performer, lead the customer to a paradoxical result: a product that fully meets the requirements specification, works so poorly that it is simply impossible to use it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a4/f7b/337/0a4f7b33768638ee4b08f8a92a9cd894.jpg"><br><br>  The situation is well illustrated by the well-known parable about the miserly man who brought a piece of material to the tailor and asked him to sew a hat.  When ordering, the miser asked if there was not enough material for two headgear?  Having received an affirmative answer, he asked about three, four ... and bargained, finally, at ten.  A week later he received his order.  There were really ten caps, but they all barely made a little finger. <br><br>  Perhaps a hat that can not be worn on the head is an excellent sketch of the main trouble of a bad product: the <strong>nominal presence of poorly functioning functionality is in most cases equal to its absence</strong> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6dc/d72/489/6dcd724895735c3424dbe80f379c3e42.jpg"><br><br>  And, if the parable seems a bit absurd and divorced from the current realities, the reader will easily find a lot of modern examples (for example, among multi-functional electronics). <br><br><h4>  Reasonable use </h4><br>  TK, with all the pros and cons - is, above all, a tool that requires proper application.  It is appropriate in its pure form when it comes to a highly standardized solution - for example, the supply of cement of known composition and grade in a clearly defined time frame. <br><br>  The construction of technical specifications in principle - destructive for the product. <br>  Once the author met with the Customer, who claimed that the description of his task does not allow any discrepancies and nothing depends on the performer.  On his desk were proposals from different contractors and he chose the most budget.  At the same time he was dressed, for some reason, not in the cheapest clothes and, sitting in a comfortable chair, drank fragrant Pu-erh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d6/160/800/7d6160800a21ae10db4e3e12f9932861.jpg"><br>  I urge the Customer to remember that TK is a useful thing, but it describes the <strong>lowest level of solution quality</strong> .  A good, really good product requires a human attitude to itself at all stages of creation.  Love it, take your time with the release, and it will certainly turn out amazing! <br><br>  Images taken from sites: <a href="http://pt.wikinoticia.com/">pt.wikinoticia.com</a> <a href="http://cultofmac.cultofmaccom.netdna-cdn.com/">cultofmac.cultofmaccom.netdna-cdn.com</a> , <a href="http://www.popwuping.com/">www.popwuping.com</a> , <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">www.thinkgeek.com</a> <br><br>  PS I'm not sure about the chosen blog, but I haven‚Äôt found a more suitable one. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138131/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138131/</a></p>
