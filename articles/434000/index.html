  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most significant data breaches in 2018. Part Two (July-December)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  In the <a href="https://habr.com/company/devicelockdlp/blog/432354/">first part of the</a> survey of leaks in 2018, I considered the most significant data leaks for the first half of the year and now the time has come for the second part. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p8/7a/ub/p87aubymh3qjfeceyqgc_t9f49s.png"></p><br><p>  As mentioned earlier, only major cases of information leaks around the world were reported to the review and the month of the incident is not indicated according to the time of its occurrence, but according to the time of disclosure (public announcement). </p><br><p>  <em>Let's see how the second half of the year proceeded ...</em> </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4 id="iyul">  July </h4><br><ul><li><p>  <strong>Fashion nexus</strong> <br>  Personal data of 1.3 million customers of British online fashion stores (brands such as Jaded London, AX Paris, Elle Belle Attire, Perfect Handbags, Dirty Little Style Bitch and Traffic People) served by Fashion Nexus and its White Room Solutions subsidiary flowed away. . <br>  Names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, MD5 and SHA-1 password hashes have suffered. <cut></cut></p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Macy‚Äôs</strong> <br>  The American trading network Macy's warned customers who have accounts on the retailer's website that unknown persons had access to these accounts. <br>  After logging into the account, the attackers received such client data as the full name, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, payment card number and expiration date. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Level One Robotics and Controls</strong> <br>  Incorrect configuration of the rsync program, designed for remote backup and file synchronization, led to the leakage of 157 gigabytes of confidential information from automakers such as Toyota, Tesla, GM, Ford, VW and many others. <br>  The data was left in the open access by the Canadian manufacturer of robots Level One Robotics and Controls. <br>  Leaked assembly line schemes, plans and shop layout, robot configuration, personnel access request forms, non-disclosure agreements, personal data and documents (driving licenses, passports) of some Level One Robotics and Controls employees, invoices, contracts and banking information. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Singhealth</strong> <br>  In Singapore, hackers broke into a database of patients who visited the SingHealth clinic network from May 1, 2015 to July 4, 2018. <br>  The names, addresses, gender, race, date of birth of more than 1.5 million people have been stolen. <br>  In addition, stolen data on medical prescriptions of 160 thousand people. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Telefonica</strong> <br>  The attackers took advantage of the vulnerability of the computer network of the largest Spanish operator Telefonica and managed to get all the personal data of millions of the company's customers.  Telefonica is one of the 10 largest telecommunications companies in the world. <br>  Leaked data includes names, contact information, contact numbers, payment data, and everything that contains a standard bill for communication services. <br>  Telefonica customer data is easily downloaded as an unencrypted spreadsheet (CSV). </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Timehop</strong> <br>  The Timehop ‚Äã‚Äãservice, which collects ‚Äúmemories‚Äù from social networks, revealed a data leak of 21 million users. <br>  Leaked user names, email addresses and authorization tokens in social networks. <br>  A small number of entries included the name, phone number and email address, and a slightly larger number ‚Äî the name and phone number, and a larger number ‚Äî the name and email address. <br>  This leakage was made possible by the compromise of an administrator account for accessing the cloud computing environment. </p><br></li></ul><br><h4 id="avgust">  August </h4><br><ul><li><p>  <strong>Huazhu hotels group</strong> <br>  Data leakage from Chinese hotels has affected about 130 million people. <br>  13 hotels owned by the management company Huazhu Hotels Group, suffered from leakage of customer data. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>ABBYY</strong> <br>  The 192 gigabyte MongoDB database file belonging to one of ABBYY‚Äôs customers and containing more than 200 thousand scanned documents was in free access. <br>  The database contained contracts, confidentiality agreements, letters, internal documentation and other documents recognized using ABBYY OCR. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Data trust</strong> <br>  The 14.8 million Texas voters were publicly available.  A total of 19.3 million voters are registered in Texas.  Database file size of about 16 GB just left on the open server. <br>  The database was originally collected by the Data Trust analytical company serving the Republican Party. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>T-mobile</strong> <br>  Personal data (names, email addresses, postal addresses, etc.) flowed out of 2 million accounts of the US mobile operator T-Mobile. <br>  The data leakage was caused by an error in the code for interaction between the Apple online store and the T-Mobile server responsible for checking user accounts.  The check function allowed an unlimited number of checks entered by the user of the data, which allowed attackers to search through PIN codes and the last 4 digits of the social security number. </p><br></li></ul><br><h4 id="sentyabr">  September </h4><br><ul><li><p>  <strong>Facebook</strong> <br>  Facebook has officially confirmed the data leakage of 50 million accounts, with up to 90 million accounts potentially affected. <br>  Hackers were able to access the profiles of the owners of these accounts thanks to a chain of at least three vulnerabilities in the Facebook code. <br>  In addition to Facebook itself, those services that used accounts of this social network for authentication (Single Sign-On) suffered. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Alibaba Group</strong> <br>  More than 10 million records containing user names, phone numbers and mailing numbers were stolen from the Cainiao Network company, which is part of the Alibaba Group holding. <br>  It was discovered that attackers had installed malware that stole personal data in barcode scanners.  Then the stolen data was resold on the black market. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Veeam Software</strong> <br>  In open access in the Amazon cloud, a Mongol database owned by Veeam was discovered. <br>  The 200 GB database contained 445 million records containing names, email addresses and in some cases IP addresses.  Data was collected for the period from 2013 to 2017. </p><br></li></ul><br><h4 id="oktyabr">  October </h4><br><ul><li><p>  <strong>Google</strong> <br>  The error in the Google+ social network API allowed developers to get access to such data of 500 thousand users as: logins, email addresses, places of work, dates of birth, profile photos, etc. <br>  Google claims that none of those 438 developers who had access to the API knew about this error and could not use it. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Sberbank</strong> <br>  An online archive of Sberbank‚Äôs files containing official documents on the integration of software development and operation processes, in particular, data on checks of the bank‚Äôs systems, was found in the Internet. <br>  In addition, an open source CSV file with an Active Directory upload, containing the names and e-mail addresses of approximately 420 thousand Sberbank employees, was released. <br>  Sberbank itself does not consider this incident a leak.  However, the bank notified the European Commission of the incident, as among the compromised information were data from EU citizens. </p><br></li></ul><br><h4 id="noyabr">  November </h4><br><ul><li><p>  <strong>Quora</strong> <br>  Quora's social knowledge sharing service reported a data leak of 100 million user accounts. <br>  External penetration into the service system was discovered, which resulted in: names, email addresses, hashed passwords, data from connected networks (Facebook, Google);  public content, including questions, answers, comments, positive voices;  non-public content, including requests for responses, communication between users, negative votes. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Marriott</strong> <br>  Marriott International said that hackers gained access to the Marriott-Starwood Hotels database, which contains personal customer data from 2014 to the present. <br>  In total, the data of 500 million guests who used the services of Starwood Hotels leaked, while the 327 million leaked records contain passport numbers, email addresses, postal addresses, and in some cases even bank card details. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>American Express India</strong> <br>  The American Express payment system allowed the leakage of personal data of 2.3 million Indian customers through a freely available MongoDB database. <br>  The database contained Aadhaar identifiers (the unique identifier of a citizen of India), names, email addresses, addresses, names of relatives, account numbers. </p><br></li></ul><br><h4 id="dekabr">  December </h4><br><ul><li><p>  <strong>Nixi Technology</strong> <br>  The Chinese company Nixi Technology, which produces the Boomoji mobile app for creating animated 3D avatars, has made publicly available two Elasticsearch databases with personal data of 5.3 million users of iOS and Android versions of Boomoji worldwide. <br>  In addition to the data (user name, age, gender, country, phone model, and even the name of the institution) directly by the application users themselves, 125 million contacts of their address books (a copy of the phone numbers) were stored in the databases, as well as the history of geography for 375 thousand. users. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>French MFA</strong> <br>  On December 5, unknown persons gained access to a database with contacts (names, email addresses and phone numbers) for emergencies, all (540 thousand) registered in the Ariane system. <br>  Ariane is an online service, created in 2010, which allows French citizens traveling to ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù countries to notify the country's foreign ministry. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Data &amp; Leads</strong> <br>  Another leak of personal data of US voters.  The open Elasticsearch database contained almost 60 million records containing names, surnames, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers and IP addresses.  The total amount of data exceeded 73 GB. <br>  The database is most likely owned by a Canadian company, Data &amp; Leads, which collects and processes data. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Sky brasil</strong> <br>  Names, addresses, passwords, phones and other personal data of 32 million customers of the Brazilian pay-TV operator and the mobile Internet Sky Brasil were found in the freely accessible Elasticsearch database. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Freeze pro shop</strong> <br>  Freeze Pro Shop‚Äôs Scottish ski shop online leaked 4 million personal data records (names, email addresses, postal addresses, phone numbers and order details) to its customers, leaving the Elasticsearch database publicly available. </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Google</strong> <br>  Another vulnerability in Google+, which led to data leakage of 52.5 million users. <br>  The vulnerability allowed applications to retrieve information from user profiles (name, email address, gender, date of birth, age, etc.), even if this data was private.  In addition, through the profile of one user it was possible to receive data from other users. </p><br></li></ul><br><p>  Regular news about individual cases of data leakage, promptly published on the channel <a href="https://tele.click/dataleak"><strong>Information Leaks</strong></a> . </p></div>
