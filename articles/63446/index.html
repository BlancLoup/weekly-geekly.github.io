Like many newbies, I quickly got hooked and sometimes I can‚Äôt tear myself away, burrowing deeper and deeper into the chains of discussions :) The most important advantage of this resource, in my opinion, is its API and, therefore, a huge number of various clients for many platforms.  For myself, I chose the excellent <a href="http://mobileways.de/products/gravity/gravity/">Gravity</a> software, in my humble opinion, the best client for Symbian.  But not all my friends have smartphones, and therefore there was a need to find a decent client for Java2ME, which made me puzzled. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

Mobi Twitter</b> <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/70/62/43/946593/0/superscreenshot0003.png" alt="image">  . <img src="http://img2.pict.com/47/44/42/946595/0/superscreenshot0004.png" alt="image"><br>  The application of the Canadian company Cascada Mobile.  Some GUI is present, mainly in the form of a background (with a logo) and a graphical menu.  Not pretentious to resources, good speed, no brakes, but given the meager set of functions it could weigh less (272 KB).  Taymlenta presented in the form of simple text (no manipulation in the taymlenta field is not allowed, the nickname and time of sending the tweet are highlighted in blue, see screenshot).  There are no settings as a class, if the login and password are not considered as such (the password is stored in the clear, even the asterisks are not closed).  You can only read and post.  Retweet, follow / unfollow, DM and Reply (!) Are missing. <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://www.breezeapps.com/applications/view/%3Fa%3D/MTWITTER/74573/133/">www.breezeapps.com/applications/view/?a=/MTWITTER/74573/133</a> <br><br>  <b>2. jTwitter</b> <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/1f/97/78/947124/0/superscreenshot0007.png" alt="image">  . <img src="http://img2.pict.com/6b/b9/3d/947129/0/superscreenshot0010.png" alt="image"><br>  A very simple application, in the graphics interface is absent as such (except, perhaps, splashscreen and boot animation).  From the settings there are only 2 items, whether to remember the login and what time-tape to show at startup.  The number of functions and the lack of interface justifies the size of just 35 KB.  Timelta as text (tweets strictly in one line, see the screenshot), it is possible to navigate by choosing one or another tweet.  When clicking on a tweet, the full text of the message with the user's username opens.  You can only read and post.  Retweet, follow / unfollow, DM and Reply (!) Are missing.  If you inadvertently go to the menu, then you will not be able to return back, just re-login.  It is possible to see a list of those you follow, from the list you can open each timeline.  There are numerous glitches. <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://www.jtwitter.com/">www.jtwitter.com</a> <br><br>  <b>3. Twittai</b> <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/4d/71/cb/947407/0/superscreenshot0013.png" alt="image">  . <img src="http://img2.pict.com/c4/1a/6e/947408/0/superscreenshot0015.png" alt="image"><br>  The first is quite a full-fledged client.  There is some GUI (there are even effects a la OperaMini) and almost a complete set of necessary Twitter-functions.  The timeline already looks more like the original Web, with the exception of userpics (see screenshot), you can navigate through tweets, by clicking on a message, the user‚Äôs timeline leaves (in the upper right corner of the userpic).  Reading, posts, retweet, follow / unfollow, DM and Reply are fully featured, and you can also add to favorites, watch user‚Äôs friends, profiles, watch your friends / followers.  Of the settings, only the manipulation of fonts and clearing the cache.  Last update more than a year ago, the project seems abandoned. <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://www.twittai.com/">www.twittai.com</a> <br><br>  <b>4. JibJib</b> <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/41/2b/60/947966/0/superscreenshot0018.png" alt="image">  . <img src="http://img2.pict.com/d2/bf/49/947967/0/superscreenshot0019.png" alt="image"><br>  There is no graphical interface at all, at first glance it looks like jTwitter, but unlike its colleague, it has much more functions and settings.  There are no userpics, in any submission, a timeline in the form of text with one-line tweets (see screenshot).  On the timeline you can navigate, by clicking on the tweet, the full text appears with the options Reply and Toggle Favorite.  You can read, post and respond, DM is only in view mode, follow / unfollow is absent, you can view the timeline of a separate user.  There is no such thing as ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, all navigation is accompanied by a full reload.  In the settings you can specify the length of timelists, startscreen, as well as gateway.  Last beta was May 5, 2009 <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://jibjib.org/">jibjib.org</a> <br><br>  <b>5. TinyTwitter</b> <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/f9/84/a1/954524/0/superscreenshot0035.png" alt="image">  . <img src="http://img2.pict.com/56/57/5c/954533/0/superscreenshot0038.png" alt="image"><br>  Finally, full timelists with userpics, but tweets are still in one line.  On the timeline, you can navigate, by clicking on a tweet, a pop-up window appears with full text and one single ‚ÄúOk‚Äù function.  For some reason, the settings are not in one place, but scattered around the menu, you can customize fonts, the time of the update of time tapes, as well as some features of the UI (userpics on / off, sound notification).  You can read, post, reply, follow links from tweets, DM only in view mode.  There is an opportunity to see the selected user timeline.  All the time something loads and unloads, for the same reason it closes for a long time.  Last beta was in March 2009 <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://www.tinytwitter.com/">www.tinytwitter.com</a> <br><br>  <b>6. Twibble</b> <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/81/39/ff/954581/0/superscreenshot0040.png" alt="image">  . <img src="http://img2.pict.com/0c/67/13/954598/0/superscreenshot0039.png" alt="image"><br>  One of the most sophisticated clients, there is almost everything.  Full timeline (userpic, tweets completely), normal navigation (everything is intuitive, joystick navigation, a full set of hot keys).  There is GPS support (you can set your location, see the user's location, if it is installed).  The most complete set of all the necessary Twitter-functions: tweet (you can do it from the browser), retweet, reply, DM, follow / unfollow, favorites, searches.  Its interface, support for those.  A good set of settings: update frequency, notification methods, gateway, userpics on / off, templates (text for tweets).  All this beauty is only 106 Kb and works quite quickly.  Last updated early May 2009 <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://www.twibble.de/">www.twibble.de</a> (they have a client for the desktop on Adobe Air) <br><br>  <b>7. Twim</b> <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/90/fd/76/954833/0/superscreenshot0041.png" alt="image">  . <img src="http://img2.pict.com/af/84/81/954834/0/superscreenshot0048.png" alt="image"><br>  There is a GUI, funny timeline in the form of balloon's (see screenshot), but there are no userpics.  You can navigate through the timeline, by clicking on a tweet, a menu with possible actions drops out.  There are main functions: tweet, reply, retweet, DM, favorites, no search.  You can open a separate tweet in the browser, it is possible to upload photos (directly from the camera, or already saved, services: yfrog, TwitPic, Twitgoo).  There are no settings available.  Last updated May 2009 <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://www.substanceofcode.com/">www.substanceofcode.com</a> <br><br>  <b>8. Twitteresce</b> <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/57/5b/1b/955478/0/superscreenshot0050.png" alt="image">  . <img src="http://img2.pict.com/51/f1/7f/955479/0/superscreenshot0051.png" alt="image"><br>  There is no GUI, almost a clone of jTwitter and JibJib combined (although, judging by dates, it is the other way around).  I could not connect, assuring me that Twitter is not available at the moment.  Judging by the menu, you can post (delete), read and view DM, this ends the functions.  There are a couple of settings points: which timeline to display and the update period.  Last updated November 2007. The project is abandoned. <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://wiki.github.com/madpilot/twitteresce">wiki.github.com/madpilot/twitteresce</a> <br><br>  <b>9. TwitterGPS</b> <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/66/d6/2b/955570/0/superscreenshot0061.png" alt="image">  . <img src="http://img2.pict.com/46/20/49/955572/0/superscreenshot0064.png" alt="image"><br>  The name speaks for itself.  You can post and read, post in two versions: with coordinates and without, the tweeting functions end there.  There are some settings for GPS and separately for Twitter (update frequency, fonts), everything is very neat.  Able to open links from tweets.  He does not understand Cyrillic (see screenshot).  Last updated June 23, 2009 <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://www.getjar.com/products/16595/TwitterGPS">www.getjar.com/products/16595/TwitterGPS</a> <br><br>  <b>10. uTweetMe</b> <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/52/97/03/955644/0/superscreenshot0053.png" alt="image">  . <img src="http://img2.pict.com/18/bc/23/955646/0/superscreenshot0059.png" alt="image"><br>  Cute <a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project">Tango</a> icons, a strange menu item for a Twitter client, more like an email program.  Timelta in the form of text with notes on reading (possible mass marking / removal of marks), tweets are not fully visible.  You can navigate through the timeline, a full text can be opened by clicking on a tweet.  The main functions are present: tweet, reply, retweet, DM, no search and favorites.  It is possible to save the selected tweet as a template (you can, of course, create your own templates).  Opens links from tweets.  There are no settings, despite the presence of this menu item.  Last updated in June 2009, the project is actively developing. <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://utweetme.navetke.ru/">utweetme.navetke.ru</a> <br><br><h6>  On this kind of everything that I managed to find from highly specialized clients, all kinds of combines like IM-monsters Nimbuzz, Fring and applications like ‚Äú2GO‚Äù I did not consider for the purity of the experiment (there is still <a href="http://www.jargong.com/">Jargong</a> , but there and the project seems abandoned).  And as a promised bonus, I want to show you a small alternative, these are aggregators (also on Java2ME) and FlashLite, all of which also work on regular phones. </h6><br><br>  <b>1. Snaptu</b> <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/76/84/1d/955933/0/superscreenshot0024.png" alt="image">  . <img src="http://img2.pict.com/c6/fd/4d/955934/0/superscreenshot0027.png" alt="image"><br>  The aggregator is a container application where you can add / remove various applications available from the manufacturer.  I‚Äôll say right away that in this aggregator the best Twitter client for Java2ME (nothing prevents you from leaving it alone :)) Look at the second screenshot, beautiful and, most importantly, convenient timeline, smooth scrolling (very much like <b>Gravity</b> ) and thoughtful navigation.  There is a complete set of all necessary functions (there are even groups (!) And a preview of pictures).  Recommend :) <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://www.snaptu.com/">www.snaptu.com</a> <br><br>  <b>2. goojet</b> <br>  Here, even the screenshots did not do.  Customer aggregator.  An annoying service to get to the application I needed, I had to go through a bunch of registrations, get tons of SMS with instructions (unlike Snaptu, which is simply downloaded and installed, without any registrations), etc.  As a result, they found several Twitter applications in their stores, but in actual fact they turned out to be, to put it mildly, not competitive even in comparison with Twittai (at least), while this all terribly slows down and constantly contacts its server. <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://www.goojet.com/">www.goojet.com</a> <br><br>  <b>3. ShoZu</b> <br>  Screenshots did not do.  Customer aggregator.  Position yourself as ‚Äúyour personal media hub in your pocket.‚Äù  The client is installed (rather cumbersome), then you can add the necessary applications.  After the launch I demanded to indicate how I will upload the photos, apparently this is a priority direction.  Further registration got sick to go. <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://www.shozu.com/portal/index.do">www.shozu.com/portal/index.do</a> <br><br>  <b>4. MobiTile</b> <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/b9/d8/86/956196/0/superscreenshot0070.png" alt="image">  . <img src="http://img2.pict.com/0b/7a/2c/956197/0/superscreenshot0073.png" alt="image"><br>  Nice and easy FlashLite application (* .swf file).  Three services are supported: Twitter, Facebook and LiveJournal.  We add the necessary account and forward.  What can Twitter-component?  There are: tweet, retweet, reply.  Oathly claims that the user is none other than the chosen one and can post as many as 170 characters, instead of 140 characters.  You can view user profile (userpic is displayed). <br>  <i>Home:</i> <a href="http://www.mobitile.com/">www.mobitile.com</a> <br><br><h5>  That's all.  As a result, he himself stopped at <b>Snaptu</b> , his friends also liked him very much.  As you can see, there is practically no choice, but what a wide field for activity!  :) Good luck and good choice to all. </h5><br><br>  If someone wants to invite a Hosco user to our community, send an invite to him by email: <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/090702/6542/LaTWWwTYhW.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63446/</a></p>
