  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Heated universe, or under-driven internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Human history, as many know, is linear.  It would seem that you can build a clear schedule of ‚Äúprogress‚Äù in which every year we are better able to manage information, store and process informational traces of our life.  But no.  We know much more about the era of Rome than about the five following centuries.  The ancient Russian churches of the XII century reached us much more than the churches of the XIV century.  As a result, some eras remain in the memory of mankind, while others, seemingly having a historical memory, are in no way less right, disappear, dissolve in time. <br><br>  It would seem that with the beginning of the information revolution these information fluctuations should disappear: after all, we have accumulated so many means and methods for collecting and storing information: disks, floppy disks, CD / DVD, tape drives, etc.  etc.  Nevertheless, the phenomenon of fluctuations overtakes us here too.  The information recorded on vinyl records can be read (listened) to almost any of us, if such a desire exists.  But to read the information recorded on the CD of the first generations, it is almost impossible to read.  It is obvious that the labor efficiency of those who transferred data on these CDs that are vital for humanity, tends to zero, to ‚Äúwarm the universe.‚Äù <br><br>  History is repeated in the Internet space.  The hot debates of the Usenet era are fully available in Google archives, but how much information, especially multimedia, remains on the sites of the 1990s?  Forums of the early 200s?  The endless changes of design and content have led to the fact that a lot of information from this period is simply unavailable, or disappeared altogether.  Of course, we can ride a waybackmachine, and admire the front pages of sites, sometimes even get a little inside, but what‚Äôs the share?  5 percent of the information entered?  ten?

      How old is your site?  Registration year?  1999?  A working archive of materials?  Until 2003? <br><br>  In which period do web-services live today?  Are we not like the very collectors of content for the CD, whose work today is available only to a narrow group of historians of science?  What will allow us in the future to consider what we write valuable?  Tagi, chaotic and meaningless? <br><br>  When Tim Berners-Lee began work on designing the Semantic Web, then, in addition to creating a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù web, his goal was to create a system that could remember itself, to keep its history.  Alas, as we well know, the high speed of technological change does not allow really big projects to take root on the Internet, to change it.  Most of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù projects today play the role of chaos, successfully resisting attempts to streamline the Internet and increase the efficiency of our contribution to it. <br><br>  In the community of "subarovodov" on auto.ru very disdainfully treat their comrades "mazdovodam."  "Under-full" they say.  It is sad to live in the epoch of under-full Internet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4460/</a></p>
