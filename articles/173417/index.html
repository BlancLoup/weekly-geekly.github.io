  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The ideal job for the developer. How to evaluate?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is no secret that the demand for developers is constantly growing.  Along with him, wages grow and companies literally "hunt" for classy specialists.  Therefore, each more or less worthwhile developer constantly receives many offers of job changes, even if he does not seek to change it.  All jobs are different and it is difficult to understand which offer is better and which is worse.  I will share my ‚Äúmagic formula‚Äù that I have been using for a long time.  To whom it is curious, I ask under kat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/300/7e7/a3c/3007e7a3c1493c51dc801c86b0f5af00.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I did not change my job so many times, but several times I had an insistent desire to change it.  However, I receive fresh offers several times a week.  Many of them sound attractive and, willy-nilly, they make you think about a possible change of work.  Someone offers a big salary, someone has excellent social conditions or a new modern office with a bunch of buns, and someone just has an interesting promising project with a bunch of new technologies.  The choice is perhaps the most difficult thing in life.  It makes you suffer, reason, weigh the pros and cons, worry.  And at the same time it is often necessary to compare "apples with oranges" (a good office with new technologies).

      In order not to suffer, I invented a ‚Äúmagic formula‚Äù for myself, which helps me to make decisions quickly and not worry about them.  At once I will make a reservation that the formula works for me and is purely individual.  If you like the ideas embedded in it, then you can concoct yourself the same very quickly. <br><br>  So, the basis of the formula is the desire to bring all the factors to one scale.  I chose money as a scale (you can choose time or other abstract units).  My job is to exchange my time and skills for money (plus the opportunity to earn new skills), so this scale I liked the most.  The basis for the assessment is salary (this is a standard monthly payment for a 40-hour working week). <br><br>  We now turn to the factors.  Let's look at some of them that affect the formula.  First we take the distance to the office.  I consider the average time to go to the office and back for each day, and then I divide it by 8 (8 hours a working day) and multiply by salary.  That is, with time on the road in the region of 2 hours, I will spend a quarter of the working day extra on work-related activities.  Everything is quite simple.  Next we consider the number of days of paid vacation.  Here you can do a little smarter.  Take a certain average number of vacation days in the market, for example 21. This will be considered the norm.  Each missing day will give a negative amount, and each additional day will give a positive amount.  You can also multiply by the "importance of vacation" for you. <br><br>  Next come social factors.  It turns out that insurance, gym, English courses, swimming pool, parking, training and other nishtyaki easily converted into money.  Take the cost of the same services in places acceptable to you and make the calculation of costs per month.  Often the surprise is that a large number of cool social factors easily fit into $ 150 monthly expenses.  Add to our formula. <br><br>  The last category is the most difficult - it is an office, an interesting project and people in the company.  With the office, you can simply do - make a fixed rate for a cool office or the same with a minus for a bad office.  To better reflect your growing expectations over time, it is better to make it a percentage of your salary.  The interest of the project and prospects in the company can be assessed as an office, and you can go a little further (for far-sighted comrades).  Try to build for yourself a career plan for the next couple of years and use your finger in the sky to evaluate its reachability in this company.  For a basis, you can again take the difference in salary today and after a year or two.  From this difference you need to take a certain percentage and use it in the formula.  It's simple! <br><br>  As a result of this work, you will get a really useful formula that will help you quickly understand whether this or that job is interesting for you compared to your current job.  The formula is inaccurate, but it will give you a primary idea, which is enough to continue the conversation with recruiters or the categorical "NO."  Is someone else using this approach?  What indicators do you still take into account? <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : In the comments I was reminded of another important factor that should be taken into account by those involved in activities on the side - this is the time of possible distractions from work.  It is not even about the very time of distraction, but about opportunities in principle.  Many companies block access to Skype, social networks, and other resources.  This can obviously go to a minus with a certain coefficient, because it limits your possibilities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173417/</a></p>
