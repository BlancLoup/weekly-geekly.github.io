  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of trends in the market of video recorders</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello dear friends!  We continue to analyze the Russian market of video recorders and today we will ‚Äútalk‚Äù about the development trends and innovations in this rapidly developing segment.  So, in the beginning, I would like to highlight several trends in the development of automotive ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/40e/41b/ffc/40e41bffcb5493938e2861414185d506.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The first trend</b> - Full HD is no longer the benchmark for resolution.  There are gadgets that can shoot video as Super Full HD (2 304 x 1 296 pixels), in which the picture is one and a half times clearer than when recording in Full HD.  Undoubtedly, this trend of transition to a higher quality of shooting will be continued.

      <br>
      <b>The second trend</b> - hybrid recorders moved from the category of "rarity" in the category of popular models.  ‚ÄúHybrid‚Äù devices can be divided into three large groups: ‚ÄúDVR + Navigator‚Äù, ‚ÄúRecorder - Sports Camera‚Äù and ‚ÄúRecorder + Radar Detector‚Äù.  It is worth noting that the latter group is in the greatest demand, because in addition to shooting video recorders reduce the risk of receiving a ‚Äúletter of happiness‚Äù from the traffic police. <br><br>  <b>The third trend</b> is the emergence of "smart" DVRs with full-fledged traffic safety systems.  For example, some recorders are able to monitor the lane and when abruptly changing or intersecting the double solid line, the gadget will start to emit sharp warning sounds. <br><br>  <b>The fourth trend</b> is the demand for such functions as the G-sensor (shock sensor) and the GPS module and, as a consequence, the appearance of many models supporting these functions. <br><br>  But these are all common features.  To create a more detailed picture, we suggest you divide all DVRs into classes, starting from their price: <br><br>  - budget - up to 4 thousand rubles <br>  - ‚Äúgolden mean‚Äù - from 4 to 8 thousand rubles <br>  - premium class with a price tag of 8 thousand rubles. <br><br>  Well, consider each class separately. <br><br>  <b>The first class</b> - budget DVRs, whose share in total sales previously reached 40-50%.  But the demand for these models is steadily declining, since the models in this segment are practically not improved and are distinguished by a scarcity of functionality.  Also, low-end models are usually equipped with cheap matrices that shoot low-resolution video (VGA - 640 √ó 480 pixels), and the promised HD quality or even Full HD is achieved by programmatically stretching the image to the desired size.  There is also a dubious build quality.  What awaits this segment?  We will wait for lower prices for more advanced components, which will allow them to ‚Äúmigrate‚Äù to this class and improve the quality of shooting. <br><br>  <b>The second class</b> - the average price category.  This class is the most numerous and rapidly developing, which means that it accounts for the bulk of sales.  And this is not surprising, because it is in this price category that the ‚Äúplayers‚Äù are pleased with honest HD or Full-HD resolution, and the rich choice makes it easy to choose a ‚Äúgadget‚Äù with the necessary functions, up to the GPS module.  Separately, I would like to note that in this price category you can already find hybrid video recorders and pretop models that are distinguished by a rich bundle and wide functionality.  And undoubtedly this segment will continue to develop and improve. <br><br>  <b>The third class</b> is premium.  In truth, a rich class.  Representatives of this part of the market give a natural Full-HD-resolution or Super Full HD.  Premium class DVRs are notable for high quality performance, advanced filling, stylish design solutions, as well as a rich bundle.  In this price category, I ‚Äúplay‚Äù also hybrid and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù DVRs, well, and, of course, recorders with two cameras.  All models are already in the ‚Äúbase‚Äù have a wide functionality that allows you to use the gadgets to the maximum.  In what direction will this segment develop?  Obviously, manufacturers will strive to improve the quality of shooting, installing new matrixes and even more advanced optics on their models.  Also, it is on the premium models that the latest technologies are implemented, which are inherited by models from the average price category. <br><br>  As you can see, the situation is extremely interesting.  Gradually, the recorder from the car gadget is increasingly turning into a universal device, the scope of which is much wider.  Such applications become possible due to the fact that more and more manufacturers are completing their devices with additional accessories for "non-car" use, and also include special modes in the firmware of the devices. <br><br>  <b>Let's sum up!</b>  Technologies are constantly moving forward and most manufacturers strive to make their devices more advanced, while not ‚Äúinflating‚Äù the price tag.  Every day, new high-quality and technologically advanced models with the broadest functionality come onto the market.  And, obviously, this is far from the limit and manufacturers will continue to improve the DVRs, and we can assume that in a few years the recorders will turn into whole complexes for ensuring road safety! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375025/</a></p>
