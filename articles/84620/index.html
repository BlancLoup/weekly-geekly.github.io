Say, we have finally been able to connect your house and now all the benefits of civilization are available to you for so many rubles. per month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/296/e6d/c62/296e6dc622a4c7ddad91f06a342a19eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Usually the call is distributed on your phone that you leave on the site, in a special form.  I heard several times that calls were made to a landline, but everything was always jammed by the dialing error, the carelessness of those I heard about, and other factors.  Well, except when the Internet was offered by MGTS, in this case, all calls are made exclusively to the home phone number, and these calls are always cold.

      And I, for example, almost two weeks ago, called on a mobile phone, and offered to connect the Internet from the company Akado to the address of my registration (I live there exactly).  I did not fill out the forms, and in general, I do not have the desire to connect to this provider, because it is so-so.  He does not satisfy my needs in almost any of his areas of activity, and how he does it, too. <br><br>  But this is not the point, but the fact that Akado‚Äôs company, in an incomprehensible way, had a bunch of {mobile number} + {my place of residence}.  In no way, I try very hard, I do not distribute this information.  Apart from the cellular operator, the provider, well, and obvious places, such as the company where I work. <br><br>  Frankly, I did not immediately realize such a discrepancy.  And only in the third minute, explaining that Beeline tariffs (from Hi-Light club) more than suits me, I thought of asking where did Akado company get my phone from.  To which I was told that they were given a special program, and the call-center operators do not even suspect how the information gets there.  That, in general, is logical. <br><br>  The logical step, as it seemed to me, is to call the company first and ask me to switch to someone from the administration.  And it is sitting in another city, at godless prices (went for a weekend to friends in St. Petersburg).  As it turned out, the site has only phones for connection and service TP. <br><br>  Further, I did not find an email address such as info @.  I was told on the phone that all administrative issues should be solved only by arriving at their offices, which is generally strange for an Internet provider.  As a result, having decided that the parent organization will be able to help me, or at least redirect the letter where it should be, I wrote to info@akado-group.ru. <br><br>  The letter, on the basis of a cup of tea, turned out like this: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  I did not find the email address of the Akado company itself, which deals with the Internet + TV connection.  However, there is a very important question that I wanted to clarify with you. <br><br>  Just today, an employee of your company called me with a proposal to connect to Akado.  She told about tariffs and stuff.  Milo talked.  However, in the third minute of the conversation it occurred to me that I had never left the connection request, and Akado could not know my mobile phone (it was the call that was made to him). <br><br>  I clarified the information from Beeline, of which I am a subscriber, Beeline employees confirmed that the company provides relevant information only in cooperation with our valiant competent authorities. <br><br>  I am the owner of the housing that I was offered to connect to, my number also has been with me for years.  No one except me would have raised this question (although I specifically clarified with my 70+ year old grandfather and my ex-common-law wife). <br><br>  Accordingly, the question arises, how does the company Akado know a bundle of my mobile phone + passport data (in particular, the address of my residence where I live). <br><br>  Counting on your early reply. <br><br>  And yet, I warn you right away that this correspondence will be given in my blog (in the signature), on habrahabr (under my nickname absolvo) and on my twitter (nickname is the same). <br></blockquote><br><br>  Here it should be clarified that the information from the staff of Beeline, at first, I did not receive through official channels.  I just called friends and asked if they were friends with Akado bases. <br><br>  By the way, the letter was not answered to me.  Exactly, like no answer came from any bot with the number of the ticket delivered to the letter.  Generally lost, in general.  Well, to clear my conscience, I certainly tried to write to them on Twitter.  No sense whatsoever. <br><br>  It turns out to be an amusing situation, which I have already mentioned briefly above, that if you are not a client of the company, then the maximum is how you can communicate with someone other than girls from the call-center on connection issues and TP (they also refuse to talk to TP, think) only arriving at the offices of Akado.  No email, no phone, nothing.  21 century in the yard, the capital of Russia, is immediately visible.  Excuse me, but I really don‚Äôt have time to go to the offices, although if I‚Äôm invited to discuss the situation that I am describing, I will come over a cup of tea.  But it seems to me that Akado‚Äôs company is incapable of such a move. <br><br>  By the way, in order not to seem unfounded, I will also publish a letter to Beeline, and just below the answer that was sent to me.  He is typical, and they answered me, most likely, with paste-paste.  However, they responded, unlike Akado, and responded quickly. <br><br>  Here is what I wrote in Beeline: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  I am your client, as well as mobile communication, so already both wire and wireless Internet. <br><br>  I would like to comment on your letter, which I wrote in Akado.  Do not worry, just read :) <br>  I want to ask, since I will publish your answer on my web on my blogs, introduce myself and indicate the position (although you have it in the rules of good form). <br><br>  In short, in which cases you can transfer to the party the private information about the client, in particular the connection between the telephone number and his place of residence. <br><br>  Below is a letter in Akado. <br>  Then I quoted the letter in Akado that you read above. <br></blockquote><br><br>  But Beeline's answer: <br><br><blockquote>  Dear Dmitry Alexandrovich! <br><br>  Thank you for contacting us. <br><br>  According to the rules of our Company, personal data of Beeline Clients (for example, the owner‚Äôs surname, first name and patronymic under the Agreement) are classified as confidential information, the protection mode of which is established by the owner of information resources in accordance with applicable law. <br><br>  Thus, in its work OJSC VimpelCom strictly adheres to this rule and respects the confidentiality of information related to the maintenance of the radio telephone under the Agreement on the provision of cellular radiotelephone services. <br><br>  We hope for an understanding of our position. <br><br>  Your ‚ÄúBeeline‚Äù. <br></blockquote><br><br>  What conclusions did I draw for myself?  First, someone could commit a mean joke, and on my behalf send a cookie on Akado's website, as well as sign me up for a daily gay subscription.  But honestly, I rather doubt it.  The fact is that my phone is in the public domain on my blog, and it‚Äôs pretty easy to come up with much nicer and more pleasant things.  And it's not disgusting, just a call. <br><br>  Secondly, the conclusion may be hasty, they illegally use various private databases, such as the database of subscribers of cellular operators.  Well, I do not see any other option. <br><br>  However, this post is written for several tasks.  I want to convey this information to Akado, and get at least some feedback, as well as, suddenly come to someone else, in which other way the gentlemen of Akadov could learn information about me, precisely in this combination. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84620/</a></p>
