Especially the technical community.  This topic, which he touched on several times yesterday during the Q &amp; A session on Google I / O. <br><br>  Decision?  Among other things, Larry wants a place in the world in the spirit of Burning Man (the annual festival of contemporary art in the United States) for the freedom of action of crazy creators.  A place with less public pressure, a place without unyielding obsolete laws. <br><br>  Earlier in his speech, Pagege rebuked the technical community for focusing too much on the competition between Company A and Company B:

    <blockquote>  ... We are doing about 1% of the possible.  Despite the rapid changes, we are still moving slowly, according to our capabilities.  I believe that all this is connected with the negative ... Every story I read is Google against someone.  It's boring.  We need to focus on creating something new. </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Even when something is initially done as an experiment ‚Äî as is the case with Google Glass ‚Äî we all begin to make fun of it. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNobody needs this!‚Äù Shouts one site.  ‚ÄúThis is another Segway!‚Äù, Shouted dozens of others.  ‚ÄúBut at least they are trying to do something awesome (crazy),‚Äù you will not hear that from anyone. <br><br>  Is Google Glass something weird?  Of course!  Damn weird.  But it is also a rare example of when a company uses available funds to try something unusual.  Sergey Brin became our "Tony Stark".  It should inspire.  Product must not win or lose.  Several companies have the resources and talent to create something incredible (perhaps seemingly stupid).  You can just try to see what happens.  And only a few of these few have a desire to try. <br><br>  In response to the question of how to change the situation and make the world a more positive place for people creating unusual new things, the head of Google answered: <br><br><blockquote>  Yes, this is a really good question.  I believe that people by nature think about change.  We are changing rapidly, but some of our laws do not change with us.  Laws [regarding technology] cannot be correct if they are 50 years old - more than the Internet.  Perhaps many of us need to enter other areas to help them improve and understand technology. <br><br>  We do not want our world to change too fast.  But perhaps we could separate part of the world.  I like visiting Burning Man, for example.  A place where people can try new things.  I believe that as technical specialists we must have safe places where we can experience new things and reveal their impact on society.  Identify the impact on people until the product is distributed throughout the world. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78f/983/796/78f9837962ad988adc03d0b2fe59e5d9.jpg"><br><br>  (If you think about it, this is exactly what Google does with Glass, being constrained by limitations due to the lack of special space for the experiment). <br><br>  Maybe Dr. Island Moreau would do?  Of course, although I would have attracted more missiles and robots than leopard people and other beastmen.  But I would buy a house there ‚Äî or, at the very least, I ordered an annual trip. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180005/</a></p>
