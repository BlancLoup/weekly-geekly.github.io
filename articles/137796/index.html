  <section class="page js-page"><h1>When Business became Social</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Social Media is like teen sex.  Everyone wants to do it, no one really understands how, and when, finally, it happens, everyone is at a loss as to why it happened so-so.  More than 2 years ago, this ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù was given by Google analyst Avinash Kaushik on his twitter.  IMHO, since then, things have not changed much. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The attitude of the business community to Social Media is reminiscent of a layered B-52 cocktail.  The top layer is those people and companies who are familiar with the subject superficially, the presence or absence of them in the networks of the weather does not.  Although, there are less and less of each month - even Luzhkov has a sickly page with 40 likes. <br><br>  The middle stratum is made up of those who work in networks, but so far have neither a clear work strategy nor the corresponding team.  They are the majority, they still do not see much benefit from working in networks, but they cannot pass by.  If you search on facebook, you will see that now Gazprom has its own page.  Even I do not understand why it is for them, apparently there is no place to put extra money.

      The deepest layer of the cocktail is those people who ‚Äúgrew up‚Äù with the networks, or they understood what changes were coming and decided not to miss their chance.  When you look at their pages, it seems that they literally live in social.  networks.  Especially you start to believe in it, if you start with some American guru like Paul Greenberg, who has almost 11,000 tweet messages.  Paul and the company are constantly engaged in educational work in the direction of B2S (Business to Social) - they are trying to resolve the issue of the effective use of social media in business.  I must admit that they do it very successfully, because  speak in simple language and tell interesting things from the life of adherents of social networks. <br><br>  Talking about business-to-social, Mr. Greenberg says that consumer behavior has changed, and now it‚Äôs your customers who are the actual owners of your brand.  That is, now it is the users who form the image of the company, describing their experience of communication in their blogs, microblogs, statuses and leaving likes.  As a result, such a trend in the mass consciousness of the consumer must be taken into account by the business at the time of choosing a strategy for communicating with customers.  This strategy was the strategy of Social CRM. <br><br>  Born in the depths of blogs, the name Social CRM quickly leaked to the business-oriented part of the Internet.  The idea was interpreted very freely and twisted as the "experts" of all stripes wanted, so the concept of sCRM was incomprehensible, forgive me for the tautology.  In such an environment, attempts by domestic minds to ‚Äúadopt‚Äù the best practices, clearly, did not succeed in any particular way. <br><br>  We could not calmly observe this picture, so we decided to put bullet points above all i in this question.  And the point is not in our ‚Äúacademic‚Äù interest, but in the fact that for a company the issue of using sCRM has become an edge.  At a certain point, we realized that without a competent and well-thought-out ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù work strategy, we are missing opportunities to manage customer experience (aka Customer Experience Management).  To close the gap in strategy, we invited a guest with a report from the author of the sCRM idea, who will show a complete picture of what is happening and help you understand how best to build a business in the existing conditions. <br><br>  Constantly communicating with other companies, we are well aware that the majority are faced with a similar problem of understanding the laws of sCRM and do not know what steps to take.  Therefore, we decided that it would be right to make a report open and conduct an online broadcast of this event. <br><br>  Terrasoft Customer Forum will be held in Kiev, on March 6, in the conference hall of the Hyatt Regency hotel.  Information on the event you can get <a href="http://www.terrasoft.ru/tcf">here</a> , on the same page is the registration form.  See you later! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137796/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137796/</a></p>
