  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Emigration to Poland as a student or as a freelancer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/164765/">Having commented on a</a> good <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/164765/">IT-emigration</a> article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/164765/">in the very heart of Europe,</a> I immediately received many letters <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/164765/">in Slovakia</a> via internal mail with questions about this, and with requests to tell more.  Seeing such a stir, I decided that it would not be superfluous to try to paint in detail for a wide audience. <br>  Since I moved with a girl who was traveling here to study for a magistracy, I have the opportunity to describe both ways of moving, together with the pitfalls we encountered.  Thus, the article is divided into 2 parts - moving the freelancer, and moving to study. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Moving Freelancer </h2><br><h4>  Effortless efforts </h4><br>  When there was a need to move to Poland, and even to its capital, Warsaw, I started trying to find information about possible ways to move, and of course I was overwhelmed with information that was not useful to me and spending time on developing which did not make sense.  Since I myself am a fan of reading about the wrong ways to make a light bulb for understanding the nuances and results, I will include them in my article. <br><br>  On a tourist visa, you can stay in the country for 30 days (or 90, it doesn‚Äôt matter) a year, and every day should be well-documented housing.  This can be a printed confirmation of your reservation from the hotel / hostel.  In any case, for full relocation of the tour is not an option.  Having a tourviz you are not allowed to do business and work. <br><br>  On a guest visa, the situation is almost the same.  You can stay within the country up to 90 days a year, for a guest visa you need either an invitation from someone who has the status of a resident of Poland, or an invitation from a Pole.  It is not very frustrating to do, all our friends go to us like that.  But as in the case of a tourist one, it will not work and do business on a visa of this type.

      <br>
      Then I tried to make myself a Pole card, because I heard that someone-there once-there was a Pole of the purest blue blood.  I found out such a detail that is not written on the websites of consulates - the map of the Pole can be made only in a straight line and only up to the third generation.  I mean, if my grandmother is polka and I have documentary evidence of this, I can get a Pole card;  if the sister of the grandmother is polka, I can not;  if the great-grandmother is polka, I can't either.  It happens that the documents are lost somewhere, for this, as it turned out later, you can hire a private detective who will find all the relatives, and rummage through the old paper archives in order to find all the necessary documents, if they exist, of course. <br>  For those who do not know - the Pole‚Äôs card is such a document which gives almost the same rights as citizenship, with the exception of the right to vote.  You can get it not from all countries, but from most of the CIS countries you can, see the list on the website of the consulate.  To get it, you need to meet the generic criteria, pass the Polish exam at a basic level, and verbally at the consul solemnly say that you recognize Poland as your country.  In this case, the native passport is not selected, it is just a formality.  But it is worth noting that for the patriots of their country, this formality is the basis for refusing to get a card, so that it performs its function to the full. <br>  In general, the idea with the map of the Pole I failed because it turned out that my Polish roots are much deeper than the third knee. <br><br>  While spending time on everything described above, I was also very actively looking for companies in Warsaw who would like to invite me to work with them.  I wrote to all the companies that I found, even compiled resumes in Polish, I went to many funds, and also to several clubs of Ukrainian-Polish businessmen.  But it's a bad thing. <br>  First of all, the Russian companies there wept, and go find them again. <br>  Secondly, even despite the fact that almost all Poles speak fluent English to some extent, they still prefer to work and speak Polish, except in cases where companies are working in the English-speaking market. <br>  Thirdly, in order to hire you, such a company must submit a formal request to find an employee to the appropriate authority, and refuse at least 30 Polish citizens (if memory serves), only in this case the company can accept a foreigner.  At the same time, they should also make a document in which the reasons for accepting you to work are written, it should be described why exactly you approached, and the citizens of Poland did not approve.  In short, the procedure for the company is not the most desirable. <br><br><h4>  Righteous path, though not the best </h4><br>  As it turned out, from countries such as Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and further down the list, if a simplified visa entry to work that, let's say, is somewhat distant from the field of IT.  These are stone cutters, builders, diggers, steelworkers, milkmaids, and other representatives of workers of heavy physical labor for a penny.  In order to go to Poland by such an employee, an invitation is made to work for half a year (with the option to extend the work by another half a year, if the head gives the go-ahead) of the appropriate level according to a special program, which is designed to fill Poland with cheap labor, and this the program fully justifies its existence. <br><br>  Without further ado, I decided that I am not a princess on a pea, and in general a man decorates work.  Therefore, I started looking for how to go there in this way.  Immediately I came across several firms in Ukraine that are engaged, if I may say so, to recruit these workers to Poland.  I chose the Job West Kharkov office.  In fact, it is quite convenient to turn to such a company, compared to finding such work yourself.  They are engaged in paperwork, freeing you from the time spent and a lot of unnecessary and incomprehensible information.  Your business is to contact them, come to the office, sign a number of documents, pay money through the bank (a year and a half ago it was about 400 dollars in 2 stages - 200 immediately and 200 when they found you a job).  They are looking for a job for you up to 2 months, as soon as they find the documents sent by the delivery service, and already with them you can go to the consulate to make a semi-annual visa. <br><br>  But do not really rush to contact them if you want to really work as they suggest.  In Warsaw, I did not receive any promised calls from employers, and on Skype, representatives of Job West suddenly froze, after a week they disappeared altogether.  But at least I was already in Warsaw, and in the next six months I had to decide how to stay here for the next six months. <br><br>  Summing up the money and time to spend on the move with the first month of life: <br><ul><li>  payment for the ill-fated Kharkov company - $ 400 </li><li>  visa fee - $ 30 </li><li>  train Kiev - Warsaw - $ 110 </li><li>  insurance for six months - $ 50 </li><li>  riding to Kharkov and back - $ 50 </li><li>  first month of life in Warsaw - $ 1000 </li></ul><br>  <b>Total $ 1640</b> <br>  A little further, I will talk about more human ways of arrival, which I learned already being here.  For the money, even a little less work. <br><br><h4>  Upon arrival, a little about life here </h4><br>  Since the girl arrived about a month earlier than me, by my arrival she found and rented an apartment.  If there is no one to find and rent an apartment, then the expenses should be added 2-3 days in the hostel while you search for an apartment, this is another 15 bucks a day.  A decent studio by my standards in a 3-minute walk from the metro and 2 metro stations from the center costs 1,200 zlotys, which is about $ 400 (it should be noted, we were lucky with the apartment, usually this costs $ 100 more).  Utilities + Internet per month approximately total less than 100 dollars.  Food prices are very affordable, as are the restaurants (if you don‚Äôt go to fashionable restaurants), and $ 400 is enough to eat as you want and what you want, sometimes go to places, sometimes smoke hookah. <br><br>  A separate paragraph should be told about the Internet.  Here, in contrast to Ukraine and probably Russia, there is no such thing that you simply connected to the provider, and then you wanted to disconnect and switched to another.  Here all companies work on contracts, the minimum contract period for the Internet which I found was 1 year (now this company has already been swallowed up by Orange), as a rule, contracts need to be concluded for a year or two.  The address can be transferred freely, that is, if you have decided to move to another address, then this most likely will not become a problem.  But it may be that your provider does not work at the new address.  In case of refusal of the company's services ahead of time, you will have to pay a fine, the amount of which directly depends on the remaining term of the contract.  As a rule, the penalty is to pay the entire remaining contract period + they throw in a percentage, say 20%. <br>  Internet speed is good, stability is high.  But it is significantly more expensive than Ukrainian, I pay about $ 25 a month for 60Mb / s. <br><br>  If you want to go exactly to Warsaw, and plan to do it by spring-summer, then I recommend to immediately buy yourself a bike of the Dutch or urban type, in Warsaw it is an archiological transport, because  the city is adapted for this more than, and there are heaps of parks.  Upon request, I can recommend excellent Italian restaurants and several other cuisines for my taste, as well as a good hookah, I know that IT specialists, as a rule, love it. <br><br>  A little bit about the Polish language.  He is a member of the Slavic language group, so for people who know Russian or Ukrainian, studying it is not as difficult as for the rest.  It has many similar words, and many similar rules with Russian / Ukrainian.  For myself, I made such a conclusion regarding the time of learning the language, perhaps it is not correct: <br><ul><li>  if you live among the Poles and communicate all the time with the Poles - 2 months </li><li>  if you do not live among the Poles, but you are constantly forced to communicate with them, whether it be work or study - six months </li><li>  if you communicate fully Polish only 2 times a week in Polish courses - 2 years </li></ul><br><br>  There are many programs and funds that help foreigners to integrate into the country - they teach Polish, help with consultations on certain issues.  But they need to be found, they need to sign up, they need to actively ask questions, they will not run after you of course.  Thanks to my girlfriend, I was lucky to get into one of these foundations, I have been going for free a year 2 times a week for Polish language courses, and I am very pleased.  Therefore, I recommend everyone to do the same. <br><br><h4>  More about moving, for those who read </h4><br>  Now about a more convenient way to move, about which I learned already lived here for almost six months.  I met with good people, owners of a business incubator who is designed to facilitate the integration and expansion of business in Poland.  In addition to its main activity, this company can issue work invitations, on the basis of which you can make yourself a one-year visa.  To make such an invitation costs about $ 100, and the same amount you have to pay monthly for being in this fund.  In general, the procedure for creating such an invitation will take about a month, + a week for a visa, and you can go.  Maybe with numbers or deadlines, I'm a little confused, for detailed information you can contact the mail <a href="">anastasia.work1@gmail.com</a> .  The option is checked by me personally, since I myself have been a user of their services for a long time, and now I continue to consult with them. <br>  In addition, in the near future I will most likely need developers of iOS, Android, php, UI-designer, artist, and even then I myself will be looking for people from the CIS to come, so if you are interested in working in Warsaw, follow <a href="http://hantim.ru/">Khantim</a> . <br><br>  At this point, the story of moving a freelancer to Warsaw is over, I hope that I did not miss any important points.  Further the story of the girl about moving for study on a magistracy. <br><br><h2>  Student relocation </h2><br>  A little about my experience as a Polish student and how it actually happened. <br><br><h4>  Why precisely Poland? </h4><br>  A rather subjective decision, but for him I had several reasons: first, after studying for an international program for 3 months in Tallinn, in Ukraine, the prospects began to seem more and more vague (both in terms of the quality of education and in terms of the future job search ).  Secondly, I did not see a better way to pull up languages.  Thirdly, since it doesn‚Äôt matter where you studied all 3-4 years in the bachelor‚Äôs degree, you will still be judged by your diploma after graduation.  And having a European diploma in Europe breathes somehow more freely (I do not argue that experience is more important, but for the start it was also significant for me).  Choosing between the EU countries, especially after cold Estonia, I really wanted something closer and dearer.  Poles are simple people, so it‚Äôs not difficult to adapt and you don‚Äôt have to break yourself. <br><br><h4>  Where to begin? </h4><br>  First of all, it is important to decide which language you would like to learn.  At the time of admission, my Polish level did not have time to move from scratch, largely because of the spontaneity of the decision on admission.  I really didn‚Äôt want to lose a year to study it, so the priorities were definitely English.  One of the advantages of learning is in English, I can say that being in Poland you cannot learn the local language, especially when you start working.  And here, simultaneously with studying Polish (which is quite easy for Russian speakers), it is possible to improve English, which significantly increases the further field of activity. <br><br>  Choosing where exactly to go for a master's degree, I suddenly found out that there are quite a few universities in Poland that offer training in English, there are even special resources for finding them, for example, Study in Poland, as well as numerous international exhibitions on training abroad.  But most of those universities that are offered on such resources where they do all the hard work for you (like filing documents, your admission, preparing documents for a visa invitation, etc.) cost unreasonably expensive.  This narrowed my search to more affordable options, I decided to do the whole flow myself, and I strongly advise everyone to do it on their own, too - there will be a minimum of difficulties. <br><br>  I stopped at the university according to the ‚Äúcapital‚Äù criteria (there are always more chances to find a job, well, we live more fun here), ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù (the cheapest university turned out to be coincidentally the best economic university).  I give a link to his website: <a href="http://www.sgh.waw.pl/index_en.html">www.sgh.waw.pl/index_en.html</a> .  Tuition is 6,200 euros for 2 years (the first 1,700, the rest 1,500 per semester).  I will not describe the learning process, but it‚Äôs really interesting and, most importantly, practical, Baltserovich, the CEO of various financial institutions, teaches, there is a course in Deloitte and DB Schenker. <br><br>  The university is very popular international exchange programs.  I mean not only ERASMUS, but such as CEMS (the best universities around the world select their representatives based on competitive criteria, then each of the selected people chooses a country where they want to go for half a year or a year and receive a second higher education there The main condition for getting there is fluency in 3 languages, but in spite of all the selections I don‚Äôt know anyone who would like to get there and couldn‚Äôt). <br><br><h4>  Part-time job </h4><br>  If we take into account the fact that study still takes a substantial part of the time, plus Polish 2 times a week, there is not much time left to work.  Therefore, the first thing I did was get a internship in the marketing department at a school of foreign languages, I found a vacancy at a university resource (I worked mostly in English, I listened more to Polish).  By the way, practices in Poland are very popular, so many, having worked for a short time for a nominal fee in a solid company, make this their resume much more attractive.  Then I found another company operating in the Russian market, and then another one, in which the rate of learning Polish is growing.  Therefore, if you want to work in Poland and with the Poles, then the best way to learn a language faster and to get experience is to go to a 1-3 month practice (somewhere it is paid, somewhere it is not), but Start is what you need. <br><br>  In general, for me, as a person who is quite far from working online, studying in Poland made it possible to get a European diploma, find a job, pull up languages ‚Äã‚Äãand generally adapt in the country and make various acquaintances. <br>  To think about enrolling in such a university in Poland as mine is necessary from the end of spring (but still, the sooner the better).  Over the summer, you need to have time to apply to the university and start preparing documents, the most time-consuming of them is to take the IELTS (I attended preparatory courses at the British Council, I passed 6.5, which was the minimum) or TOEFL, then everything on the list: translation of diplomas (including a school certificate), confirmation of university accreditation (apostille), medical certificates ... I will not try to remember all the necessary documents, as I‚Äôm probably missing something, the list of documents at the university is usually provided upon request. <br><br>  On the basis of all these documents, in September you are credited and I send you a one-year invitation, which is the basis for obtaining a visa for approximately a week.  And starting in October, you are a student.  The main thing to remember is that if you are traveling as a student, then in addition to some privileges, there are some drawbacks - for example, that you can work officially only in summer or during holidays, you cannot work during the rest of the time.  The good news is that there is a possibility of formalizing your work activities as a long practice, it may even be listed as free. <br><br><h2>  In conclusion </h2><br>  Warsaw is a beautiful city for living both by yourself and with your family, it‚Äôs quite easy to get a child to a local school, and there children grasp the language about 600 times faster than adults.  The city itself is littered with skyscrapers, everywhere there is a lot of greenery and parks, free wifi and hammocks are everywhere (hammocks less often, and in parks).  Riding on bicycles here turns into pleasure, because absolutely everywhere on the edges there are ramps for bicycles and wheelchairs, roads and pavements are even and without potholes. <br>  The most pleasant thing is of course, people who are very polite, always disposed to help each other, and smiling as a rule. <br><br>  <b>Upd.</b>  Thanks to <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/kwull/" class="user_link">Kwull</a> for the detailed information. <br>  For a Pole card, at least 25% of Polish blood is needed, i.e.  great-grandfather and great-grandmother enough, but you must be both.  If a grandfather or grandmother, then one is enough.  Supporting documents are fairly easy to find in the archives.  Most often they request documents about participation in the elections to the Seym (the fact that a grandmother or grandfather voted) or about the service of the Polish army.  There is no need to hire any detective, at least in Brest :) And then there will be enough birth / marriage (divorce) certificates from you to a relative. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164783/</a></p>
