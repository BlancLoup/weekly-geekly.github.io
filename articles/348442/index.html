  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Raiffeisenbank begins the second set of Java school</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Scrum, smoothie, edzhil, blockchain, big date, "in which department the card was drawn up, go there and go."  Well, in general, we all heard that now in the trend in the banking sector. <br><br>  Where can you get into it and gain a critical mass of knowledge for a young developer?  In the Raiffeisenbank Java school: here they will quickly learn everything, tell, show, and even pay. <br><br>  What is our <a href="http://1.changellenge.com/javaschool%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Djavaschool">Java school</a> ?  This is a three-month paid internship at one of the largest banks in Russia for undergraduate and undergraduate students.  In a short time you will learn how to work in a team on the SCRUM methodology, get / hone your skills in Enterprise development, increase your speaking skills, stumble on all the pitfalls of team work on a single project using version control systems and argue with the team, what is better, GIT or subversion.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vg/le/a7/vglea7ugotltulvtpiek00rovso.png"></div><br>  Next - an eyewitness account.  From the first, so to speak, hands. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the first day you plunge into the work environment.  When I arrived, they gave me the data of my account and told me where to call to activate it.  It was possible to choose a workplace from free to your taste - everyone works on thin clients.  Gradually, the rest of the team members were brought up, and we were called to the first MeetUp.  In the dining room. <br><br>  At lunch, I had to meet with the team and solve organizational issues.  We were given the first task: to determine your schedule (time of arrival at the office, lunch, etc.) and schedule the time for the ‚Äúdaily‚Äù (daily meeting of the SCRUM-team), talked about corporate style of clothes and SCRUM values ‚Äã‚Äã- this interaction, flexibility , transparency, trust, openness and respect. <br><br>  After that, we were invited to a meeting where the company's employees discussed the introduction of the SCRUM methodology and its pitfalls.  After a heated discussion, our team was instructed to prepare a presentation on SCRUM, so that we could figure it out ourselves and tell us what it was and what it was eating with. <br><br>  And then it started.  For two days we studied and prepared, discussed, rehearsed, drew a presentation.  Nobody could imagine that, for example, the SCRUM-team and the development team are close, but still different things. <br><br>  Fortunately, on the review they helped us to make out all the strange moments. <br>  Further training, we were "sprints" with a length of one week. <br>  We had four developers, one product owner, a whole school of SCRUM masters in the neighborhood, dozens of multi-colored felt-tip pens, several boards, a mountain of stickers, drawing papers and other equipment, and a few more meeting rooms and two dozen technologies that needed to be studied.  It‚Äôs not that all these gadgets (except technologies) were needed in real life, but once I started building a team, you need to take the maximum. <br><br>  The only thing that bothered me was the deadline ... Well, you understood. <br><br>  When planning each sprint, we learned to assess our strength and independently recruit tasks for the week.  Of course, in the first times the matter did not go quite as expected by the experts who accepted our work, and we urgently needed to finish or change something.  And due to the fact that SCRUM gives not so much an increment at the end of the sprint, as empirical experience for the team members, we quickly figured out what was happening and learned to understand what was expected of us as a result. <br><br>  We studied the Spring Framework together, looked at annotation versus XML, dependency injection, control inversion, aspect-oriented programming, learned how to write tests covering the maximum of code.  For review on all topics, test cases were written and speeches were prepared for people far from IT technologies.  Each team member at the end of the sprint could not only show his code, but also tell in human language what this code might be useful for. <br><br>  For three months at school, we had working SOAP and REST WEB-services working with XML and JSON, connections to databases, Active MQ-based queues for communication between WEB-services, and megabytes of useful for further work, laid out on general git. <br><br>  After the final training review, our team was set the combat task of transferring some of the functionality from the old corporate system to the new one.  The task involved both the implementation itself and the initial collection of business requirements, which added new colors to the workflow.  This allowed each of us to consolidate the results, to feel the real value of the knowledge acquired in recent months, as well as to improve our position before the upcoming interviews with local SCRUM teams. <br><br>  Summing up, I want to say that Raiffeisenbank, as a young developer, gave me a good starting point.  And if you want to develop as an application developer in the banking sector, then <a href="http://1.changellenge.com/javaschool%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Djavaschool">Java School</a> is what you need for a quick and effective start.  And our team is a direct confirmation of this. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ws/wt/4p/wswt4psarzezdpfd72877pjxthe.png"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348442/</a></p>
