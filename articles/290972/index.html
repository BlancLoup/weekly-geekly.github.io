  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The cost of implementing a Wi-Fi connection in the Moscow metro can reach 2 billion rubles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Slon.ru publication conducted <a href="https://slon.ru/posts/51918">its own investigation</a> , during which it turned out that the Maxima Telecom company, which had become the only winner in the state tender for providing Wi-Fi connectivity for Moscow Metro passengers, had already invested about 2 billion rubles in the project. expects to return the money within seven years. <br><br>  Thus, the company was the only participant in the 2013 auction, the winner of which was to provide access to ‚ÄúInternet resources‚Äù on trains moving at a speed of ‚Äúup to 80 km per hour with a delay of no more than 500 ms‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Maxima Telecom was registered in 2004, one of the co-founders at that time was the system integrator of ZAO ‚ÄúEnvision Group‚Äù, currently not participating in the capital ‚ÄúMaxima‚Äù and owned by Sistema.  NVision in this project was engaged in laying cables, having received a construction contract from Maxim Telecom. <br><br>  The base "SPARK" reports that before the loss of 16.2 million rubles on the results of activities in 2013, the company was profitable.  Ilya Grabovsky, head of the PR department of Maxima Telecom, told Slon correspondent that 1.8 billion rubles had already been spent on the project.  It is also known that none of the major players took part in a similar competition in 2012, finding the project unprofitable.  The point is in the unique implementation of the connection: a base station is installed every 450 meters along the length of the tunnel, there are antennas in the first and last cars of the train, which roam between stations.  In the heads of trains there are also stations transmitting a signal to access points in each car.  In total, more than 5,100 cars are connected in Moscow, at speeds up to 100 Mbit / s.

      Also, the project costs include a monthly rent for the Moscow metro, the size of which is not disclosed.  In the 2012 competition, the amounts indicated were 19,032 rubles per month for each equipment location in the tunnel and 109,659 for each kilometer of optical fiber.  Given the scale of the Maxima project, this would total for the company 204 million rubles in annual deductions in favor of the Moscow Metro. <br><br>  Maxima Telecom tries to earn money by advertising on the authorization screen and banners placed on the vmet.ro portal (the latter make up more than 60% of the company's advertising tools), as well as full-screen pop-up banners when switching from domain to domain.  According to market participants, the company needs to earn a minimum of 20-21 million rubles a month on advertising in order to return the borrowed funds within seven years, for which the project was implemented. <br><br>  The correspondent of Slon.ru concludes in the publication that the project is obviously unprofitable and in order to cover the enormous costs of the project in the coming years, Maxima Telecom will have to win another state auction from the Moscow Department of Information Technologies in order to pay debts and ensure the work of the infrastructure and increase the number of Wi-Fi users in the Moscow metro. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290972/</a></p>
