For example, by sending a request for an interview to Apple‚Äôs Russian representative office, each time we received one answer: ‚ÄúSorry, but this is not our format.‚Äù  Yes, each company has its own corporate ethics, its own requirements, its own laws, and you need to respect this. <br><br>  However, by an old friendship, we managed to contact Alexey Badaev, the former head of the Russian representation of Apple.  We met with Alexey and talked on various topics.  We are very pleased to bring the chronicle of this communication in the form of an interview to your attention. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Our dossier</b>

    <ul><li>  1996 - 2006  - in various positions in the Russian representation of Microsoft. </li><li>  2006 - 2010  - He headed the Microsoft department for the promotion of software and hardware entertainment platforms (Entertainment &amp; Devices). </li><li>  2010 - 2012  - The head of the Russian representation of Apple. </li><li>  Since 2012, Managing Partner of Taiga Entertainment. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Question</b> : Alexey, I greet you, thank you for agreeing to give an interview to our readers!  Alexey, let's start with the story.  In 2006, you became the head of the department for the promotion of software and hardware entertainment platforms (Entertainment &amp; Devices).  How and where did you come to this post? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : Before going to E &amp; D, I had been working for a company for 10 years, I was responsible for building Microsoft regional business.  To be honest, I was going to do something else, as several large projects were completed, my efforts and the efforts of my team were rewarded with various awards and special awards, a long way was made and I wanted some changes.  At that moment I was offered to launch a new business for Microsoft Russia.  I agreed. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : If it's easy to tell us what your Entertainment &amp; Devices department at Microsoft was doing. <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : The Department for the Advancement of Software and Hardware Entertainment Platforms (Entertainment and Devices) worked with several Microsoft product lines with me.  The IEB group (Interactive Entertainment Business) presented a game line - an Xbox 360 console, games and accessories for this console, Games For Windows.  Specialized Devices and Applications (SDA) focused on Microsoft hardware peripherals (mice, keyboards, webcams) and a very special product - Office for Mac.  Finally, the WPO group (Windows Platform and Office), promoted the main Microsoft product - Windows and Office.  In addition, E &amp; D around the world is engaged in musical direction, not represented in Russia.  The main distribution channel is retail networks, so we can say that we worked with the end user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dff/74e/052/dff74e052437661b5a4bfc6bc0b5c4f4.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Question</b> : We know that you are a serious gamer and with experience, still play mostly on the Xbox 360 or did you buy a PlayStation after all? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : So far, the Xbox 360. It is on it that go out exclusively or earlier than on other platforms, my favorite games. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : Computer, how do you recognize a gaming platform or think that the time of such games has already come out? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : I have always said that Microsoft is a platform holder of two platforms at once.  PC games will be as long as PCs.  Millions of users play social games.  networks are actively growing casual genres.  But PCs are unlikely to be the platform for which developers will specifically write games - the current priority areas for them are mobile devices.  Again, do not forget another powerful player - Apple.  Since the Marathon appeared on Mac computers (the first one, by the way, FPS ever), leading developers from Activision, EA, and others write games for Apple. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : What are your favorite games and genres, what do you like to play the most? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : I play, like I played mostly in shooters, there‚Äôs usually not enough time for something more serious.  From the drive almost does not remove the latest version of Call of Duty. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : Do you often play on iPad or iPhone, if so, what do you prefer? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : Mostly I play on airplanes, but I prefer to read from the devices mentioned.  Favorite games - mostly from Rovio and Days of Wonder. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : Sure, the daughter is definitely not letting go of the iPad and iPhone.  What are her preferences? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : Very carefully studying educational programs, such as "Luntik" from 1C and all kinds of "princess games" for girls.  Through the games I began to learn English. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : In general, do you think the iOS platform has a real and serious gaming future? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : I think so.  The number of devices running iOS is huge, the developers write a lot and with pleasure.  The business model is built, everything is clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c00/a02/6e4/c00a026e41175e6819bb3d7086556bd8.jpg" hspace="7" vspace="7" align="left"><br>  <b>Question</b> : How do you feel about Mac games? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : Exactly the way I play on the console, but I bought Diablo III for my home Mac. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : Do you still use Apple devices in your everyday life or are you back to Windows? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : I have a whole set of platforms in my family.  At work I use MacBook Air, on business trips I take an iPad.  There is a PC, already old, and a home server on the Intel platform. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : Alexey, let's move on to 2010.  How difficult was the decision to leave Microsoft and leave to work at Apple? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : The decision was difficult, since I worked for almost 15 years at Microsoft, it gave me a lot in terms of professional growth.  I had a lot of friends at that time. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : Now, after the arrival of several years, do you regret that you left Microsoft? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : I do not regret, I am not used to doubting what has already been done. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : By the way, why did they leave for Apple?  Was it a good offer that you cannot refuse or was it just interesting to try yourself in this company? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : Both the offer is worthy, and the strength of the brand at the company is amazing, and the products that appeared were very interesting. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : What is so positive about the two years of work at Apple as the head of the Russian representative office? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : Products, people with whom he worked.  Product quality is fantastic. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : Did Apple leave at will or as they say ‚ÄúI was asked‚Äù? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : I left myself, I maintain normal relations with my bosses and former colleagues, we meet. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : You are currently the managing partner of Taiga Entertainment.  It seems our readers have little understanding of what this company is doing, please tell us. <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : Taiga helps to work in the market for those Western (and some eastern) companies that are not ready to maintain a full-fledged office in Russia, do marketing and PR.  We also take on some of the functions of communicating with partners.  Very similar to the IMC form of interaction. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : What exactly do you do and what range of issues do you decide in your current position? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : The company employs only a few people, a typical start-up.  Engage have to all. <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : Alexey creative plans for the future? <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : Perform the planned tasks and step to the next level along the path of conquering world domination. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167705/</a></p>
