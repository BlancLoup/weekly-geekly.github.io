  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The choice of LED lamps. 1. Manufacturer selection</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this methodological material I want to discuss the logic of the selection of LED lamps (SDL) of the "corn" type.  The choice of the type is completely arbitrary, and I do not specifically decode the names of the manufacturers.  In this case, the task is to understand how the optimal choice is made (and not to find out the name of some manufacturing company). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Naturally, a search query is first compiled.  In our case, it will be something like ‚ÄúLED bulb corn E27‚Äù.  The search engine of the online store will dump you a bunch of answers, from which you need to make the choice of the most promising candidates. <br><br>  It is carried out according to different criteria: <br><br>  - quality of the description of the lamp by the seller (including contradictions and notorious lies), incl.  completeness (especially sellers do not like to give the value of the CRI color rendition index);  photos must be of decent quality and in sufficient quantity; <br>  - number of orders and rating of the lamp;  countries where customers live; <br>  - driver type: it is easy to distinguish them by what range of permissible operating voltages the seller indicates.  There should be a wide interval, for example, 80-260 V. Information like 200-240 or just 220 V most likely means that the quality of the driver is low (I cited an example in another article) <br>  - the type of SMD LED used.  This is an important issue, but we will not discuss it in this article.  I will simply list my preferences in descending order: 1) 5736SMD, 2-3) 5733SMD / 7020SMD, 4) 5730SMD.  Naturally, you can look at other types yourself.  It is advisable to choose lamps from different manufacturers on the same type of LED, if possible. <br>  - quality of materials - in particular, it is preferable that the chips of the DM are located on an aluminum substrate, this improves the heat sink; <br>  - the design of the protective cap - there must be not just holes in the upper part, but through cuts of different lengths; <br>  - product price and delivery terms.

      Those lamps from the issuance of the search query that you are interested in, you open in a separate tab.  As a result, after a preliminary analysis of the results you should have no more than 3-5 candidates.  They should be ordered to assess consumer qualities. <br><br>  For this article, I took 3 lamps rated at 15 watts.  Why 15?  Because it is a difficult task in the ‚Äúcorn‚Äù construct on the E27 base.  I will give an example: in front of you there are 20 blockheads, you need to single out the three most intelligent ones.  It makes sense to ask the test, how much will be 2x2?  No, because the correct answer will be given by everyone, and your task will remain unfulfilled.  You need to set a task that will force the subjects to strain seriously. <br><br>  The following table summarizes the key to select information about all three lamps (warm light, T ~ 2900 for all, the assessment method is described <a href="http://www.twirpx.com/file/2175185/">separately</a> ).  Everywhere are used SD 5736SMD.  Operating voltage 85-265V.  Pulsations when viewed through the camera of a smartphone are not visible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c20/758/83f/c2075883fb5ae9543e47cced35205725.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Consider the transient characteristics. <br><br>  <u>Dependence of power consumption on time</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a58/2f4/e44/a582f4e4458a5d04a4f3b695dd109f84.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Here the analysis is complicated.  Lamp AT seems to be the most "honest", the working power of 13.2W.  But while warming up, it loses the most - 15% (this is clearly seen on the yellow inset, where the data are normalized).  But the lamp AB almost fits into 10% recession. <br><br>  <u>Illumination data</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b71/b21/a69/b71b21a695a14e16fca88fc3b502fec0.png" alt="image"><br>  At this stage, the red sample (lamp MT) is eliminated - it is too little light to give.  But AT and AB are very close. <br><br>  <u>Temperature versus time</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/918/fb6/ab2/918fb6ab257efcdefb381e5cb32b4055.png" alt="image"><br>  Here you need to understand that the design of caps is slightly different.  And it is impossible to fix the thermocouple in a strictly similar place.  (To this end, some suggest drilling a hole in the base, but I thought it was unnecessary. We agreed that we would not ‚Äúfinish‚Äù the lamps.) All this means that the data on the AB lamp looks understated.  Actually, after warming up, she was very hot (her hand was burning, that is, the temperature was over 80 degrees). <br><br>  The main conclusion from this graph is again about the low quality of the MT sample.  Giving the least light, she managed to warm up to 103 degrees.  Those.  inside temperature was over 110 degrees.  Such a SOM obviously cannot serve for a long time. <br><br>  As a result, we have 2 applicants at the "finish line": AT and AB. <br><br>  The strong point of AT is the luminous flux (at the same time, the buyer is deceived by 39%, and for AB it is 46%).  The color rendition index, however, does not reach the declared value, it is quite acceptable. <br><br>  The strength of AB is a surprisingly high color rendering index. <br>  To make the final choice, look at the prices of these lamps: AT - 248 rubles.;  AB - 333 rubles. <br><br>  Thus, at this stage of the search for the SOG, we identified the most promising manufacturer.  And they made for themselves the conclusion that buying 15W corn doesn‚Äôt make much sense because  The declared luminous flux of any of the lamps did not show. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401273/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401273/</a></p>
