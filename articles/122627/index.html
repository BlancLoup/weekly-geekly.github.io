Imagine yourself a southern bird hovering above the planet at exorbitant heights.  Imagine the view that opens to you from above.  Submitted?  All this can be experienced live, if you find yourself inside the highest structure in the history of mankind - the Burj Khalifa towers in Dubai.  And do not tell me that this is not high technology! <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5908/samsungrussia.5d/0_66d78_1661e598_L.jpg" width="500" height="334"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To date, the Burj Khalifa has left far behind all the skyscrapers, radio towers, stellae and lighthouses, flying up to 828 meters from the earth's surface.

      Over five years of construction, more than $ 4 billion was invested in the project, but this is not the most impressive figure in the reputation of the tower. <br><br>  Burj Khalifa - a new business heart of Dubai, accommodating residential "areas", hotel complexes, offices and shops.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe premises is 3,595,100 square meters.  In simpler terms, at the 37-storey Armani Hotel there is a 60-storey apartment building, apartments for 700, and on top this ‚ÄúKulichik‚Äù is crammed with office space.  And so - only 164 floors.  Think about it.  164. Without technical. <br><br>  All this space is plowed by the fastest elevators in the world in the amount of 57 pieces.  True, from the first to the last floor only one goes - service.  Ordinary inhabitants of a skyscraper have to ride <strike>on the bombs</strike> with transfers. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5506/samsungrussia.5d/0_66d79_b250f5f6_L.jpg" width="500" height="334"><br><br>  <b>Building</b> <br><br>  No less than the result of construction, it affects its process.  The construction division of the Korean concern Samsung - Samsung Engineering, which built its own headquarters, as well as record-holders of its time - Taipei 101 and Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur were chosen as the general contractor for the project. <br><br>  A special building has a special concrete: especially for Burj Khalifa, an improved concrete composition has been developed that can withstand temperatures up to +50 ¬∞ C (for Dubai it is quite important).  It is poured only at night, and ice is added to the solution.  During the operation of this concrete was used quite a lot - 330000 cubic meters.  There - 31,400 tons of steel bars. <br>  The foundation piles are driven into the ground at more than 50 meters. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5508/samsungrussia.5d/0_66d7a_745ef800_L.jpg" width="500" height="328"><br><br>  The life support system in the tower is thought out and executed no worse than anything else.  Recycled rainwater is used for water supply.  The tower generates electricity for itself through a giant turbine rotated by the wind, as well as solar panels with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 15 thousand m¬≤. <br><br>  But with the southern sun you need to be careful, so at the same time the building is equipped with a system of protection against overheating.  In addition, the tower is ‚Äúventilated‚Äù with air along its entire height and cooled with the help of underground modules. <br><br>  In fairness, I must say that the top of the Burj Khalifa is crowned with a 180-meter spire, but at the same time, it is functional and provides telecommunications for the entire tower. <br><br>  The tower was opened in January 2010: thus, the construction lasted about 6 years.  Imagine how long a similar project in Russia would take.  Objectively - we have something to learn! <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5011/samsungrussia.5d/0_66d7c_e03ef6bb_L.jpg" width="332" height="500"><br><br>  Burj Khalifa Tower has won many records.  Omitting such purely statistical details as the difference between a building and a detached building, a building and a ground structure, etc., we say that there was nothing higher and more expensive in the entire history of construction. <br><br>  It seems that Burj Khalifa has set such a high (in all senses) bar for modern architecture that it suggests rethinking.  True, it did not make itself wait: enterprising Japanese have long been carrying out plans to build a 4000-meter city, which, thanks to a 100-meter platform, will be located right above the sea and will accommodate parks, forests and up to a million people.  Remember the movie ‚ÄúThe Island‚Äù with Evan McGregore and Scarlett Johansson?  Soon it can be reshoot in real scenery! <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5506/samsungrussia.5d/0_66d7b_c40920b2_L.jpg" width="380" height="500"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122627/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122627/</a></p>
