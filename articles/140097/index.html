There are many such methods, but I want to talk about their most important aspects. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The visual component of the application</b> <br><br>  The way your application looks, greatly affects its success and, accordingly, its sales. <br>  When creating a design, you should try to pay attention to detail.  The interface should be beautiful and attractive, and at the same time as simple and understandable for the average user. <br>  Special attention should be paid to the application icon, since the icon is what the buyer sees first.  It should display the most important "feature" of the program.  Suppose if your game has a ‚Äúfruit theme‚Äù, you do not need to display just a fruit on it, you need to show what you can do with this fruit in your game (the developers of the game Fruit Ninja did it very well).

      <b>Promotion by Apple</b> <br><br>  If you come up with a unique idea with an original performance, high-quality and beautiful design, then there is a big chance that Apple will want to promote your game.  Therefore, before releasing an application in the AppStore, it is worthwhile to once again think about how your application is better than its analogues (if there are such ones, of course) and whether this is enough to <s>conquer the world to</s> conquer the vast spaces of the AppStore. <br><br>  <b>Reviews on sites</b> <br><br><h6>  Pre-release </h6><br>  You say, why is this necessary? <br>  At first I thought so too.  In fact, it turned out that it was due to the prereleases that your program would already be heard, and if it came out into the world, many more people would start downloading it because they already know about it and are waiting for it. <br><br><h6>  Review after the release of the program </h6><br>  If you come under the ‚ÄúApple's eye‚Äù (in the Featured or New &amp; Noteworthy sections), then reviews will start writing without your participation. <br>  If this does not happen, then there are two ways: you can pay or not pay. <br><br>  If there is no desire, or, more often, money for a review, then you should try to ask sites to write a review for free.  It usually works if you have free promotional codes and your product is interesting and new. <br><br>  If your program is at an average level (it is good, but there are similar analogues), then you should think about a paid review. <br><br>  I want to pay special attention to how to choose sites that are worth paying for. <br>  First you need to know the price lists of such sites, you never need to send money to the first available site. <br>  Always check how much your site is visited!  To do this, there is a resource ( <a href="http://mysitecost.com/">mysitecost.com</a> ) that allows you to see the number of unique visitors to the site per day (it makes no sense to look anymore, since the publication will not hang on the first page for a very long time) and its cost.  Based on the data obtained, you can build a table of returns from the money invested in the review. <br><br>  <b>Advertising</b> <br><br>  About advertising on Habr√©, a lot has been said (especially about AdMob), but I want to add something: <br>  If you decide to promote your application using advertising, then you need to understand which audience will view it.  Actually, the biggest problem AdMob is in this.  Since its banners hang mostly in free programs, the audience that shakes them is people who do not want to pay money for software.  You need to do an advertising campaign on those resources whose readers may be interested in your product (say, if you created an iPad application, it is <a href="http://www.ipad.appstorm.net/">better</a> to pay for advertising on a site that targets an iPad audience, for example, <a href="http://www.ipad.appstorm.net/">ipad.appstorm.net</a> ). <br><br>  PS <br>  Try to invest money wisely.  Universal strategies do not happen, you always need to choose the most suitable for you. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br><h5>  Update: </h5><br>  At the request of the "workers", I post a list of sites for which you should send a review of the application. <br><br><h6>  Free: </h6><br>  <i>Russian segment:</i> <br>  iPhones.ru - 107388 unique visits per day <br>  iGuides.ru - 43754 unique visits per day <br><br>  <i>English segment:</i> <br>  AppStorm.com - 143988 unique visits per day <br>  148apps.com - 51566 unique visits per day <br>  AppCroc.com - 1099 unique visits per day <br><br><h6>  Paid: </h6><br>  <i>Russian segment:</i> <br>  PlanetiPhone.ru - 71634 unique visits per day, price - 5000r. <br>  MacDigger.ru - 26577 unique visits per day, price - 1500r (1000r. With your text). <br><br>  Lists will be added! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140097/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140097/</a></p>
