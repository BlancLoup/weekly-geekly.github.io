      But in most cases, everything is completely different.  Most often, life resembles a whirlpool of events, a wobbly train moving along roller coasters that have seen views that is too slow, now too fast.  Here, deep descents alternate, during which you hold your breath, and you mentally whisper a brief prayer, and high peaks that make you feel as if you rule the world. <br><br>  Life is ambiguous.  It doesn't matter how strict you are, how well-groomed the lawn is on the plot, or how clean the house is.  You still can not give life a neat, clear and well-organized form, subject to your control.  No  Life is messy.  Take a look at the kids and you will see its essence.  They are sloppy, inconsistent and go from serenity to horror in 0.2 seconds. <br><br>  How do you perceive life?  Are you able to get on with her, allowing yourself to give up, if you can not endure further, and have fun when everything is fine?  Do you believe that you will find yourself where you need to go, even if the road is steep?  Or are you upset and end up trying to fit your life into a clear idea that exists in your dreams? <br><br>  Despite the fact that perfectionism would be very tempting to ignore or be called "good faith at work", it is too harmful.  It creates unnecessary stress and prevents us from <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-zabavnykh-uprazhneniy-kotorye-pomogut-vam-stat-bolee-uspeshnym-predprinimatelem/">realizing our potential</a> and enjoying even a chaotic, but amazing journey - life. <br><br>  Here are a few techniques that will help get rid of the need to do everything perfectly and teach just to enjoy the road. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Let me show my creative side.</font> </h2><br>  Any kind of art is a mess coming from the heart.  Perfectionists with their burning desire to control everything keep their soul on a very short leash.  But to be happy and live a really bright life, you need to allow yourself to take off the mask and remain naked, sincere.  Using the creative component is a great way to express your true self. <br><br>  Do not look for a type of creativity that allows you to feel comfortable.  On the contrary, find something that will both delight and frighten.  The combination of inspiration and mild fear is an excellent sign that will help you grow by pushing to the right degree out of your comfort zone.  As the basic truth of life states: if in doubt, choose one that delights you and scares a little. <br><br>  <b>Task for you:</b> <br>  Embark on a quest for creative activities that shock you while inspiring you.  Trust your intuition and try not to interfere with the fear imposed by the opinions of others.  Then <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-privychek-tvorcheskikh-lyudey-2/">do this work</a> at least twice a week for at least a month, concentrating on sensations, and not on mastering technology. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Accept failure</font> </h2><br>  I bet: as a perfectionist, you are ready to flee.  But listen to me before you close this page. <br>  Failure is a nourishing ground for growth.  In your clear and controlled expectations, there is no place for failure.  But you know what?  As I said, life is messy.  One of the main components of the enjoyment of it is the ability to always get pleasure from failures, because they present the lessons leading to development. <br><br>  You can not realize your dreams, bypassing the mistakes.  Failures are the necessary building blocks of success.  If you want to be successful and live a fantastic life, you need not only to admit the possibility of failure, but also to accept and even actively seek it. <br><br>  Let me give you an example.  I am a relatively young personal growth instructor.  However, in the last 10 years I have actively sought out my own fears, doubts and internal demons.  I deliberately pounded myself in a situation where I could act like a fool, get angry or upset. <br><br>  In doing so, I gained life experience, which many have formed much later.  Doing all this intentionally and constantly receiving developmental lessons, I could very quickly learn <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-ostavatsya-produktivnym-kogda-vse-idet-k-chertyam/">from these failures an invaluable experience</a> . <br><br>  Difficult?  Yes.  Was it worth it?  Oh yeah!  Would I do the same again?  For sure. <br><br>  <b>Task for you:</b> <br>  Give yourself a "day of courage."  Chase this day for failure.  Interfere in personal conversations, behave foolishly, do not get out of the house and order a pizza for lunch.  Create difficult situations and do not do what you usually use to maintain comfort (such as manic cleaning). <br><br>  You will receive several valuable lessons, and not least among them will be the realization that failure is not so terrible.  Periodically repeat this exercise until the opposition to the blows of fate turns into your second nature. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Make gratitude a part of your life.</font> </h2><br>  Yes.  Take a look.  You have a roof over your head and an amazing life.  You may have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat it should be, or different goals and disappointments.  But this is only your perception.  And it is mobile.  You can change it at any time by choosing a different focus. <br><br>  Instead of concentrating on the hysteria that your daughter recently arranged, put into focus the fact that you have a daughter, that she is beautiful, intelligent and sincere.  You can admire her amazingly strong personality.  Or remember the days when it was placed on your hand.  Or imagine the moments when she grows up. <br><br>  Gratitude is associated with the realization that you have a choice.  Regardless of what is happening, you decide how to interpret it. <br><br>  Do not whine due to the fact that your husband incorrectly laid out the dishes in the dishwasher.  Instead, be grateful that you have a husband who did what you would otherwise have to do. <br><br>  Every situation has a positive side.  Each <br><br>  <b>Task for you:</b> <br>  Every day during the week, start and end with gratitude.  Before you get out of bed or go to sleep, take a few minutes to think about everything that makes you thankful.  Do not just list these points, but actually take the time to dive into the feeling of gratitude.  Feel it every cell. <br><br>  Additionally, select at least one ‚Äúthanks day‚Äù per month.  Regardless of what happens to you on this day, find a reason for gratitude in everything.  Do not say anything bad to yourself or others.  Be kind, <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/prinyatie-sebya/">especially to yourself</a> .  Do not reproach and do not blame yourself for anything on this day.  Feel gratitude not only to everything and everyone in your environment, but to yourself in particular. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Before we part ...</font> </h2><br>  If you actively follow these three tips for at least a month, then I guarantee: you will see the results.  You will enjoy life more and worry less about the little things.  You will become more open, supportive and loving in relation to yourself and others, and you will see positive results due to the fact that you allowed yourself to establish a connection with your own intuition and soul. <br><br>  But before you start doing these exercises, I want to get your answer.  Do you fight perfectionism?  How does it affect you?  What would your life be like without him? <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/pochemu-bolshie-dostizheniya-ne-sdelayut-vas-schastlivee-i-chto-s-etim-delat/">Why great achievements will not make you happier (and what to do about it!)</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299706/</a></p>
