  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Simple tips for the beginning freelancer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Before solving the problem of a truly Shakespearean scale - to be or not to be a freelancer, each of us goes through seven circles of hell, mixed up with doubts, fear and uncertainty about the future.  On this account, there is always a polarity of opinion among those who are ready to defend freelancing as a form of a business with rich opportunities - on the one hand, and see in it a dubious idea - on the other.  Freelance supporters rightly believe that if your professional experience and education cover several areas of activity, then, potentially, you may have several sources of income, rather than putting all your eggs in the basket of one employer.  After all, freelancing allows you to plan your life to your liking, rather than stealing time from yourself, sitting out all day in the office. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of course, when you are a freelancer, your temporary work stoppages are wholly and completely owned by you and are no longer paid by the employer, and this is perhaps the most difficult question - what to do in cases of no orders?  However, it is more reasonable to ask yourself the question not ‚ÄúHow can I avoid downtime?‚Äù, But - ‚ÄúHow can I use them?‚Äù.  Answer: "Working on your portfolio." <br>  Portfolio is the product that you offer to the client, it is your financial asset.  A good portfolio will allow you to decide when to work and how work will fit into your life plans, and not vice versa.  A good portfolio meets the following criteria: <br>  1. Attracts the "right" customers.  Such clients pay well and / or can move your career in the right direction. <br>  2. Helps to minimize downtime, providing a stable income. <br>  3. Helps to build a positive professional reputation. <br><br>  Portfolio is a serious argument that can increase your chances and help minimize the risks associated with your new lifestyle.  But for the successful work of one portfolio is not enough.  You will be helped by four success factors of a novice freelancer: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Factor 1: Trumps <br><br>  Famous brands, high-profile projects, non-standard solutions - these are your professional "chips", the essence of your portfolio.  You are proud of and show them, selling yourself as a specialist.  Trumps are carefully selected and cultivated, they are readily shown to one and all, as this is the best incentive for a client to choose you, and not another freelancer.  Trumps - is the support of your professional reputation, your priority. <br><br>  Factor 2: Communication <br><br>  Communication is an incubator of your income, it will help to attract customers, even if you still do not have trumps in your portfolio.  Before the advent of "chips" you can earn income through the inflow of low-cost projects, gradually enriching the customer base.  Everyone can become your potential customer - your friend, classmate, former colleague, etc.  There are also a large number of Internet sites, every day publishing a lot of announcements about remote work.  The more emphasis on communication you make, the faster you will improve the tactics of attracting customers, building long-term contacts, always staying positive. <br><br>  Factor 3: Calculation <br><br>  For a freelancer, the ability to prioritize and confidently call a decent price for their work is very important.  Time is the same commodity as your professional experience or effort spent on work.  Therefore, one of the most convenient and simple ways to evaluate the work of a freelancer is to determine your standard hour, i.e.  units of labor.  Calculate it easily.  It is enough to determine the desired salary level (A) - to begin with, even the size of your salary at the last place of work will fit and divide it by the number of working hours per month.  Get A: (24x8) = B (cost of your hour).  Now, in order to evaluate your work, it remains to determine the exact amount of time (in hours) that you will need for a specific project, taking into account approvals and improvements.  Be mercantile - this will help create a certain financial reserve that will support you in a period of forced downtime. <br><br>  4 factor: Growth <br><br>  This is a factor of your professional maturity, readiness to go further, loudly announcing your capabilities.  The factor of professional growth involves building long-term contacts, partnerships and business alliances that will bring you considerable income in the future.  And here the most interesting begins: professional seminars, thematic evenings, master classes, lectures, own books, articles and blogs - everything that will help your professional image and expand both your own opportunities and the possibilities of your business.  Be ready to participate in various tenders, contests, social and non-commercial projects and promotions.  They are not always paid, but by expanding your horizons, you replenish your portfolio and use temporary downtime to your advantage. <br><br>  Constantly improving your skills, participating in various projects, communicating and developing connections, you competently build priorities, increasing your income.  As a result, there are new, ambitious tasks, solving which, you will get irreplaceable experience and skills, entering all new victories and bright achievements into your professional register.  The use of all four factors will soon bear fruit - customers, projects and freedom of choice when to work and when to rest - for what, in fact, become freelancers.  Good luck to you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167325/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167325/</a></p>
