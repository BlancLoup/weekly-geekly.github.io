  <section class="page js-page"><h1>t2ru.com - a simple translator for mobile phones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many habra users, for certain there was a communicator from which they refused in favor of a regular phone.  For me personally, the main reason for the rejection of the HTC P3300 was the disgustingly slow recording speed of a new phone number of a random pretty stranger.  You stand in front of a girl, fill out fields with a stylus, you feel like a complete idiot and God forbid you make a mistake at least once - you can not even count on the next meeting. <br><br>  Now I have a completely simple Nokia 2330, which I charge only once a week, instead of the daily battle for the battery on the communicator.  This phone has solved my problem, but the functionality somehow turned out to be not enough. <br>  How can I extend the functionality of a mobile phone without having any knowledge of Java? <br>  That's right, you need to make a very simple and convenient web application, which, by the way, will work on any phone with Opera mini or Opera mobile browser, the benefit of such a lot. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One day I decided to go to one wonderful country where they speak Russian poorly, but they speak English quite tolerably.  But since my colloquial English is far from ideal and I can explain myself with the locals only on the fingers, it was necessary either to take a thick Russian-English dictionary or to rely solely on luck and adaptability.  The option to take a communicator, the battery of which sits at half a day of active use, was not even considered. <br><br>  Resolved!  It is necessary to find a service for a convenient and, most importantly, fast translation of texts from English into Russian, and from Russian into English.  I poked several mobile sites, but on average, it took 5 clicks to translate the text into two sides.  I think the majority used mobile services and know how long initialization of a single request can take. <br>  No, this is definitely not my way, so again I will feel like an idiot, like with that girl at the beginning of a note, poking in the browser with the words ‚ÄúOne moment please!  Just another moment! ‚Äù

      If you want something to be done well, do it yourself. <br>  My goal was to minimize the number of clicks required for the transfer. <br>  These are theses I have turned out: <br><ul><li>  It is not necessary to give the opportunity to choose the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the translation (this can be left to the big brothers-translators); </li><li>  The service has been sharpened for a Russian-speaking audience, and therefore translation from any language can only be into Russian. </li></ul><br>  Based on the thesis, it became clear that: <br><ul><li>  The interface is one field and one big button; </li><li>  These <s>boundless</s> large fields should be on the main page.  And not somewhere below, under the advertising mass, like some (angrily poking a finger at competitors), but at the very top of the page; </li><li>  Translation is made from any language into Russian, and from Russian into English; </li><li>  The language you want to translate from Russian can be replaced with any other language from <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/ru/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/reference.html">this list</a> , by entering something like: <a href="http://t2ru.com/%3Flang%3Dfr">t2ru.com/?lang=fr</a> in the address bar </li></ul><br><br>  The translator itself was decided to be based on the <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/ru-RU/apis/ajaxlanguage/">Google Translator API</a> , thanks to which I only implemented a prototype in the evening.  Well, then the matter remained for the small: domain, hosting (by the way, thanks to Alexander Beloglazov for the kindly provided site), a bit of senseless and merciless layout for mini opera.  And the project is ready. <br><br>  In general, initially, the service was conceived solely to meet its own needs and was not designed for everyone to see. <br>  The project is completely non-commercial and in no case is not going to become it.  This is all to the fact that I would be just happy if someone else with similar needs needed such a wonderful, simple and convenient service. <br><br>  Actually, the link for inattentive and lazy <br>  <a href="http://t2ru.com/">t2ru.com</a> <br><br>  UPD: thanks for QR <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/yasonby/" class="user_link">YasonBy</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a6/478/2c9/6a64782c996e3944d5461c2ed8efe013.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95594/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95594/</a></p>
