  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wikileaks posted more than 400 thousand documents on the hostilities in Iraq</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e1e3aa6e/abb83b3c/ffa563ca/58bbee30.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the fact that earlier the project manager Wikileaks called rumors that the service would soon publish hundreds of thousands of documents about the US military campaign in Iraq fiction, all this turned out to be true.  Tonight, the Wikileaks did indeed publish all these documents, despite the intimidation of Essendge by the US authorities, or the Pentagon‚Äôs request not to publish these documents.  The project did not listen to anyone and still published all the collected materials.  Interestingly, the Pentagon had previously asked Wikileaks not to cooperate with representatives of other media, but journalists who were susceptible to sensations, of course, did not listen. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  And the documents are really interesting - for example, according to Essendzh, the number of officially declared deaths in Iraq is much less than it actually is.  The Wikileaks team was not engaged in thorough analysis of the documents received (which is understandable - who is able to analyze almost half a million documents in a few weeks?), But according to preliminary data, at least 15 thousand people died in Iraq more than those claimed by the US authorities.

      The documents also contain information about the ill-treatment of the US military by the residents of Iraq, who were shot at the slightest suspicion of an attempt on their part.  In addition, prisoners of war were killed if they did not provide the necessary information to the US military. <br><br>  Essendzh held a press conference, where he answered many questions.  It is clear that the head of Wikileaks did not answer the question about the origin of the documents.  In addition, he remained silent when journalists asked questions about the preparation of documents, their placement and editing.  The total number of published documents relating to the period 2004-2010, is 391,831. <br><br>  Let me remind you that over the past month only lazy did not discuss the possibility of putting all the above-mentioned documents by Wikileaks service - some even thought that all this was fiction or the intention of the service to attract attention to itself with a ‚Äúduck‚Äù.  As you can see, most of the rumors were unfounded, and the documents - more than real. <br><br>  Now, unverified information that Wikileaks provided the US military with the opportunity to verify that all documents are real, slipped into the Web before putting it in open access.  In exchange, Wikileaks closed down the names of all US informants who appeared in published reports.  Over the test, according to the same unverified data, hundreds of Pentagon workers worked. <br><br>  It is also worth noting that at the press conference convened, Essendzh promised to soon publish 15,000 documents that are military military journals from Afghanistan. <br><br>  It is clear that after the publication of the data, the Pentagon immediately issued a statement about the illegality of such publication and that Wikileaks‚Äôs actions undermine the foundations of US military security.  True, service workers edited the published documents in order to erase the names of specific soldiers or local residents of Iraq.  The original documents, without editing, can be provided to journalists by special request. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288802/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288802/</a></p>
