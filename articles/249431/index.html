As a bonus, the method was not the only one.  However, all these algebras did not give an answer to the question: <b>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs inside or why we don‚Äôt show it?‚Äù</b> <br><br>  While the ancient <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">knitted knots</a> , this question <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">could not arise</a> .

However, we do not have a repetition of the school course of arithmetic here. <br><br>  The material is designed to highlight the structure of arithmetic.  We will bite into it from different sides and tear off the layers.  The goal is to understand what lies there. <br><br><h1>  2. Truth is somewhere nearby </h1><br><h2><anchor>  2.1 Why bother? </anchor></h2><br>  To rush back into the wilds, I would like to understand why this question periodically arises and why it is worth looking for an answer. <br><br>  Let us remember the school years, the time when we were first told: ‚ÄúIt is impossible to divide by zero, this is so categorical.  - You can not and everything!  But before that in mathematics everything was logical and consistent.  They folded the watermelons and read the melons, the apples rolled.  From nowhere, at the very start of the study of mathematics, the first forbidden fruit appeared. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The classic answer set only upsets</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  ‚ÄúAll is not possible!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúCheck on the calculator‚Äù - without comments.  Special pedagogical methodology. <br><br></li><li>  ‚ÄúApple can be divided into two.  You and friend Kohl.  It is possible for three.  And if a person is divided into zero, how many times should it be cut? ‚Äù- yes, it is not clear.  Yes, and a question to answer the question indecent.  And the teacher for what?  They say that the mathematics is ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù, the mathematics is ‚Äúthe queen‚Äù, and there is such an embarrassment. <br><br></li><li>  ‚Äú2 ‚àô 0 = 0 and 3 ‚àô 0 = 0, we divide both equalities by zero, then it turns out that 2 = 0/0 and 3 = 0/0.  So 2 = 3 or something? ‚Äù- an example, of course, illustrative.  But such examples not only do not give an answer to the question, they also sow the fear of science.  But what if it is impossible to divide or multiply.  And what if I slip.  Or maybe the teacher himself did not understand? <br><br></li><li>  ‚ÄúTo understand you need a lot of knowledge.  This is studied at an institution of higher education, and not all of them ‚Äù- well, yes, but why can't it be divided?  Up to this point, our causal relationships have not been violated, they went from simple to complex.  But zero is a number as a number.  Division is an operation as an operation.  Ban on level ground! </li></ul></div></div><br>  But the education system does not spare anyone ( <a href="http://nbspace.ru/math/">proof</a> ).  There is no other way but to go further and learn new knowledge.  A ‚Äúleap of knowledge‚Äù occurs in the head, as if the millennium of the evolution of mathematics had been missed.  And this is just the beginning. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/032/fe5/ba3/032fe5ba3d9146eca88cf95745118906.png"></div><blockquote>  " <i>... there is no need to show unnecessary haste, you need to give time to the student to get used to the inner revolution that takes place in it as a result of the act of knowledge</i> " - F. Klein, "Elementary mathematics from the point of view of the highest" </blockquote><br>  Formulas of a circle and triangles, a discriminant, trigonometric identities, etc., appear in high school from nowhere.  What unites them?  They all came from above, completely unknown from where.  They just need to be used, in the worst case to notch. <br><br>  Once in high school, the majority, instead of returning to the missed material, studies the ‚Äútower‚Äù with a bias in the specialty.  The volume of formulas that came from above does not bother you at all. <br><br>  Yes, the education system can be understood.  The specialist is paid for the result, and not for what he knows from where the exhibitor in his calculations. <br><br>  As a result, we do not come to conclusions, as mathematicians do.  At the moment of the ‚Äúleap of knowledge,‚Äù that is, when we discard a part of logical chains, the sacrament is decided.  We take on faith what they tell us.  The textbook turns into a scripture! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a34/098/a0f/a34098a0f0a54032b9468326d2012ea3.png" height="220"></div><br>  The prohibition of division by zero is the first and most intrusive ban on mathematics.  Therefore, it is remembered for a lifetime.  This is also a pedagogical problem that leaves an imprint on the whole of mathematics, as if on a ‚Äúmystery covered in darkness‚Äù.  This is a difficult problem, compared to it, to find the majority of the missing logical chains is not difficult. <br><br>  You can turn a scripture back into a textbook.  The reason for the ban should be strictly defined.  The task of teachers to present it clearly.  Science should not sow doubt. <br><br><h2>  2.2 What is division? </h2><br>  Captain Obvious asserts that to divide by zero you need to know what division is and what zero is.  Sadly, Google suggests that many adherents of the "division by zero magic" do not even go through the first round of this hell.  Namely, to understand what they are going to do and with what.  Take a look at Wikipedia: <br><blockquote>  <b>Division (division operation)</b> is one of the four simplest arithmetic operations, the opposite of multiplication.  Division is an operation that counts how many times one is contained in another. </blockquote>  What follows from this: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_(%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0)">The division is</a> not an independent operation.  It is determined by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">multiplication</a> .  If you look at the definition of multiplication, it is determined by addition.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Subtraction</a> is also defined by addition.  Addition independently and does not depend on anyone. <br><br></li><li>  There is no mention of zero in the definition.  With the widespread prohibition of division by zero, it is very strange.  By the way, there is no mention of zero in the definitions of the other arithmetic operations. <br><br></li><li>  The second part of the definition is not part of the definition, it is just an explanation.  You can make sure by comparing with analogues in <a href="http://bse.slovaronline.com/%25D0%2594/%25D0%2594%25D0%2581/10400-DELENIE">other trusted sources</a> . <br></li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f70/ba5/046/f70ba504666c44ea94354fff3863fd94.png" height="150"></div><br>  It seems that the most useful thing we have found here is the connection between operations.  It can be said that division is the third spinning wine, multiplication and subtraction - the second, and addition - the first.  Perhaps for this reason, the division began to fail when working with zero. <br><br><h2>  2.3 generating operations </h2><br>  So, only the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">addition</a> operation contains a rule about how to determine the result of the operation (the sum) using two initial arguments (terms).  All other arithmetic operations use this rule (matching numbers), but in addition impose their <b>‚Äúadditional conditions‚Äù</b> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/022/0b8/94d/0220b894d21742499eb73fa16f4fd620.png" height="230"></div><br>  Depending on the ‚Äúadditional conditions‚Äù arithmetic operations can be divided into <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">direct</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">inverse</a> : <br><ol><li>  Direct operations: this is addition, multiplication and exponentiation.  Expressing these operations through addition, all terms remain known.  Determining the result of any of the operations is not difficult. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b70/42b/a62/b7042ba625604da49f766645427ffc37.png"></div><br></li><li>  Inverse operations: subtraction, division, taking the root (logarithm).  These operations take the corresponding direct operation as a basis and ‚Äúinvert‚Äù it.  Thus, expressing the operation through addition, at least one of the addends is unknown.  This term is the result of the operation.  The amount is usually known. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/985/b4f/a7d/985b4fa7d18942a68cb0f957efb1cd49.png"></div><br>  Determining the result of the operation, in general, the task is not trivial. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbd/a2a/187/dbda2a18738042bc830860341830ff8e.png" height="220"></div></li></ol><br>  All direct operations have the same property.  They are <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE">closed</a> .  That is, the type of result is completely determined by the types of input numbers (it is impossible to obtain a fractional result from the product of two integers). <br><br>  Inverse operations are only partially closed (the value of the root of an integer can be an integer, or it may not).  In those cases where the result fails, the operation is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_(mathematics)">undefined</a> .  This problem has long been solved in a simple way: consider the resulting operation record and numbers as a new type of numbers: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fd/b38/7b3/1fdb387b3a34461fadba5a691223f7ca.png" height="24">  . <br><br>  Thus, we can say that the inverse operations and ‚Äúgenerate‚Äù new types of numbers. <br><br>  <b>Mathematical language:</b> <blockquote>  In general, the use of the term ‚Äúinverse operation‚Äù is not acceptable to indicate the ability of an operation to generate new types of numbers.  For example, ‚Äúadditional terms‚Äù can: <br><ul><li>  place the result of the operation in one or more terms (as shown in the example above); </li><li>  to determine the result of the operation as an answer to the question how many terms participated in the operation (fractional numbers, irrational numbers using the root); </li><li>  determine the result of the operation as the sum of an infinite number of terms.  Moreover, all addends are known (Pi number and Euler number). </li></ul></blockquote>  The division is one of the generating operations.  Perhaps something went wrong during the birth process and the newborn was injured.  In order to answer this question, you need to understand where the division came from and where the zero came from. <br><br><h2>  2.4 The evolution of arithmetic </h2><br>  Let us try to structure our understanding of arithmetic operations and the types of numbers they generate.  For clarity, let us present one of the options, how the evolution of arithmetic can go. <br><br><h3>  2.4.1 Scope </h3><br>  We are in a cave.  With the ability to count, no one was born.  However, in the process of ‚Äúcontemplation‚Äù, an understanding emerged that such a <b><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">concept is ‚Äúquantity‚Äù</a></b> .  That is, we know that two mammoths and two apples have something in common and we can express this by bending our fingers.  Accordingly, nothing but natural numbers at this stage we do not know. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c45/28a/138/c4528a138328415eb5cba3ffdc3727a7.png"></div><br>  The set of natural numbers is marked with an asterisk ‚Äú*‚Äù <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE">for uniqueness</a> .  Hereinafter, the absence of the concept of ‚Äúzero‚Äù is emphasized. <br><br>  There are <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE">several formal definitions of the</a> sequence of natural numbers.  We will take <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE">Peano's axiom</a> as a basis.  It is remarkable that these definitions were not described by the ancients.  They appeared only in the 19th century, and after they passed the refinement procedure (in the original version there were nine, in the modern form already five). <br><br>  Consider the formal definitions and their essence within our task (the traditional verbal description can be found <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE">on Wikipedia</a> ): <br><br><ol><li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49b/2e7/909/49b2e79097154fa892ba4c8871ae0e54.png" height="24"><br>  There is a number "one" and it is natural. <br><br></li><li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/429/abf/b0f/429abfb0f6fb4a8bb11fbf5291c780df.png" height="24"><br>  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successor_function">following function</a> is introduced S (x).

But the approach does not always work.  For example, to estimate stocks for the weekend, the hunter bends seven fingers for the rest, straightens five fingers for Saturday (the rate of consumption per day) and ‚Äútries‚Äù to open it for Sunday. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98f/90b/463/98f90b4631204c908aa3183df1f0c01c.png"></div><br><br>  At this point, an ‚ÄúarithmeticException‚Äù occurs between ‚Äútry‚Äù and ‚Äúcatch‚Äù.

To get rid of the requirement ‚Äúa&gt; b‚Äù, we introduce a <b>‚Äúpermutation rule‚Äù</b> .  That is, let us interchange the position of what is decremented and subtracted.  But in order for the identity to remain true, the result needs to be marked with some sort of marker, for example, a minus sign.  Any markers for mathematics are common (for example, the sign of the absence of zero in <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be6/d0b/089/be6d0b08933247a6b25a3572e6de2049.png" height="18">  ). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16c/0a2/78a/16c0a278a1834642817937811b44cb62.png"></div><br><br>  Due to the auxiliary operation ‚Äúpermutations‚Äù we came to the first abstraction - ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE">negative numbers</a> ‚Äù.  Marking in the form of a minus sign in a natural number is nothing more than a sign of deferred subtraction (but this is only for now). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/baa/a03/0b8/baaa030b8a894211946ac7214fb8fc68.png"></div><br>  We have only one non-definite case, when the diminished and subtracted are equal.  If we want to define it, then we will have to answer the question what is the <b><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE">concept of ‚Äúnothing‚Äù</a></b> .  Although what all these difficulties are for, let us denote ‚Äúnothing‚Äù by the symbol ‚Äú0‚Äù (later we shall fully understand). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/051/654/270/051654270b834b2490d2ccab606d8172.png" height="220"></div><br>  It remains to fix our decision in the form of <b>‚Äúrules for addition / subtraction of zero‚Äù</b> .  They follow from the definition of zero after a couple of simple permutations: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/540/321/f49/540321f490bd4ccbb86770a7766ea73c.png"></div><br>  Let's see how well the rules entered.  Solving equations, we can always find the unknown third from two known numbers.  It does not matter in what part of the equation it is, the solution is always unique. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdd/c7c/c3c/bddc7cc3c1b7476b99e7253ec0d95fc4.png"></div><br>  Negative numbers appeared as a result of the permutation, zero filled out ‚Äúnothing‚Äù.  Negative numbers and zero are born in different ways.  Next, we will consider two branches of evolution: separately all numbers without zero and separately zero. <br><br><h3>  2.4.3 Multiplication </h3><br>  Multiplication is by definition a shortened record of addition.  Multiplying the natural numbers, the result can only be natural.  At this stage of evolution, the usefulness of the definition for us ends. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebf/3ce/521/ebf3ce52167241f68d65dc88ca153623.png"></div><br>  For negative numbers in the definition there is not a word about how to multiply them.  These rules were formed gradually <a href="http://www.tutoronline.ru/blog/minus-na-minus-dajot-pljus-a-pochemu">in the course of solving applied problems</a> .  In the modern interpretation, they are known as an addition to the multiplication in the form of <b><a href="http://mateshka.ru/matematika/pravila-znakov.html">‚Äúrules of signs‚Äù</a></b> .  They are defined so well that by applying them to non-zero integer numbers, the operation remains closed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cb/579/4a7/1cb5794a7f89470983799934f65f9017.png"></div><br>  In the case of zero, the situation is radically different.  One more rule is introduced: ‚Äúthe rule of multiplication of zero‚Äú (multiplication of any number by zero gives zero).  But this rule only seems new.  <b>We cannot introduce any other rule.</b>  The definition of multiplication strictly connects us with addition.  Expanding multiplication through addition, we use the ‚Äúrules of addition / subtraction of zero,‚Äù respectively, we can get nothing but zero. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7da/30b/838/7da30b8382f14f0aa3cfeb63add632d4.png"></div><br>  <b>Mathematical language:</b> <blockquote>  If we compare the operations of addition and multiplication in arithmetic and general algebra, we can notice one serious difference.  In arithmetic, these operations are related by definition.  Distributive law is a consequence of these definitions.  In general algebra, on the contrary, operations are described independently of each other, and already in the definition of a field (rings, to be more precise) are associated by distributional law.  Consequently: <br><ul><li>  In the definition of the field there is a requirement for the inverse element.  In addition, for multiplication and addition, the requirement is described not symmetrically.  The absence of the inverse element by multiplication for neutral elements by addition is allowed, but not vice versa. <br></li><li>  To give symmetry in the description of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_theory">wheels, we</a> had to abandon the usual distribution law, and therefore from operating the field. </li></ul>  The field, the crown of universality, ‚Äúbehind the ears‚Äù is drawn to elementary arithmetic.  But to get rid of this support (to describe the requirements for operations symmetrically) it is necessary to expand the definition of the distribution law (starting from the ring of course).  There is reason to believe that another algebraic system may become the culmination of universality, for which the field will be a particular case. </blockquote><br><h3>  2.4.4 Division </h3><br>  Division is the inverse operation of multiplication.  In equations with positive and negative numbers, it becomes possible to substitute non-multiple numbers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/755/ae5/e55/755ae5e55ffe42c297462bad1dba552b.png"></div><br>  As a consequence, the operation generates <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE">rational numbers</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7a/dc6/e7f/f7adc6e7f6314226bada1972081475b5.png"></div><br>  To inscribe them in arithmetic, the set includes <a href="http://www.bymath.net/studyguide/ari/ari11.html">‚Äúrules for actions with ordinary fractions‚Äù</a> .

For the reference actual infinity, we take the ‚Äúspeed‚Äù at which the following function reaches any arbitrary number.  We denote this number <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/892/ffd/63d892ffd88348c38f0a4a7ad6554e61.png" height="24">  .  Not to be confused with potential infinity. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdb/284/dc3/cdb284dc352c4f4a9c32486201845138.png" height="24">  She is still unattainable. <br><br>  To obtain various actual infinities, we will use the notion of the limit of a function when tending to the number <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/892/ffd/63d892ffd88348c38f0a4a7ad6554e61.png" height="24">  .  We will not reject infinitesimally (of lower order) and will not absorb constants with infinitely large quantities, as is customary in classical analysis.  We will save all the information component number.  Accordingly, we have the opportunity to compare infinitely large numbers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25f/c88/a84/25fc88a84b754cb5b151deafdbdb39ba.png" height="400"></div><br>  Raising the number <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/892/ffd/63d892ffd88348c38f0a4a7ad6554e61.png" height="24">  to negative degrees, we get infinitely small numbers.  In fact, this is our infinite set of zeros, which can be compared with each other and used in arithmetic (as opposed to an infinitely small value in classical analysis). <br><br>  <b>Mathematical language:</b> <blockquote>  From the point of view of general algebra, our algebraic system is not a field, since there is no zero (neutral element).  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7">Non-standard analysis</a> operates with similar actual infinities, they are called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE">hyperreal numbers</a> .  Zero (neutral element) is one of the hyperreal numbers.  Accordingly, the algebraic system of nonstandard analysis operates with a field. <br><br>  Our reference infinity <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/892/ffd/63d892ffd88348c38f0a4a7ad6554e61.png" height="24">  represents one of the numbers of non-standard analysis.  However, instead of the simplified concept of ‚Äúspeed,‚Äù in a nonstandard analysis, numbers are equivalence classes of infinite sequences.  Since in our concept all algebraic operations can be expressed in terms of the following function, it means that any actual infinity formed arithmetically can be expressed through <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/892/ffd/63d892ffd88348c38f0a4a7ad6554e61.png" height="24">  . <br><br>  In fact, the limits practically cease to be simplified, in the form to which we are accustomed.  Now we just replace the variable with <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/892/ffd/63d892ffd88348c38f0a4a7ad6554e61.png" height="24">  .  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE_%25D0%259B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F">The rule of L'H√¥pital</a> is also not applicable.  In the first part, it was shown how in the classics, when defining a derivative, an infinitely small quantity is discarded.  However, it is worth noting that the concept of limit in non-standard analysis still exists, but is defined somewhat more broadly. </blockquote><br>  If there is a practical need, we can define a subtraction operation and for equal numbers (instead of the ‚Äúreduction‚Äù defined by us above).  For example, it may be a lower order number than the original numbers. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/253/d70/2dc/253d702dc88446cb8a4329d277ba520f.png" height="24">  (analogue of the equation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_theory">wheel</a> ).  Arithmetic will be closed.  But you need to be aware that the sum of two twos will immediately be equal to four with a tail.  This is somewhat similar to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">addition of speeds in the theory of relativity</a> .  Another example is thermodynamics and the concept of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%258B">absolute zero temperature</a> .  Having stopped molecules, atoms continue to move.  Having stopped atoms, quarks are still moving, etc.  Immersion is infinite. <br><br><h2>  Epilogue </h2><br>  We are between the past and the future, between the micro and macro world.  In all areas, sooner or later we find a limit beyond which we can not go and this is normal. <br><br>  In math it's not like that.  We are told that zero is a number.  Then put it on par with all the other numbers.  Then we are told that the length of the path from minus one to one is two.  And at this moment our consciousness finally dissolves zero among the other numbers. <br><br>  We cannot divide by zero, because we have forgotten that once the notion of ‚Äúnothing‚Äù and the notion of ‚Äúquantity‚Äù were mixed. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Useful literature</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  F.
