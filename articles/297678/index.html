    <hr><br><h2>  1. Risks of changing the company's management </h2><br>  Sooner or later in the life of a successful big company with a <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20202/">long vertical of power</a> there is a change of the CEO. <br>  This process generates specific risks that would be well taken into account by all its participants. <br>  Making a mistake with the choice of a new gene.  Director, the owner of the company runs the risk of lower profits, in neglected cases can lose the whole company.  But, having sold the rest of the company, most likely he will live comfortably, except without a second yacht and a football club. <br>  The new CEO will receive a guaranteed reward, the question is whether he gets a lot or a lot.  It‚Äôs not a fact that his reputation will suffer - maybe he will leave on time.  In any case, all of its shoals, if possible, will be hidden, justified by external factors.  In the absence of a scandal, as a rule, everyone is interested, including the owner, who is interested in hiding the deplorable state of affairs of a company in order to sell its remnants at a higher price. <br><br>  <b>The most significant risk for the employees of the enterprise is that they will suffer the destruction of what they have created by their work, the reduction of income, dismissal of staff reductions and the subsequent search for means of subsistence.</b> <b><br></b> <br><br><h2>  2. The emergence of a universal pseudo-effective manager </h2><br>  The choice of the candidacy of the general director is determined by familiarity with the owner and the presence of trust between them.  And the more important this relationship, the more skeletons in the closet of the company. <br>  If there are no people with the right profession among the authorized representatives, then relatives, sports coaches, country neighbors, classmates and classmates are called upon.  In general, people tested in small, trust to manage large.  But often large is not the same thing as small: a newspaper is not the same as a factory. <br>  The owner of the company reassures himself with the argument that his appointee will cope, he is a good universal manager - one of those who, although he does not know the subject area, has completed an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D6B8jJaSnogw">MBA course</a> and can successfully manage with the help of advanced people management skills.  All you have to do is monitor the ‚Äútraffic lights‚Äù in reporting: who of the subordinates got the red light of non-fulfillment of indicators should be called in, demanded eliminated, punished, dismissed. <br><br>  Let's deal with the truth of this stereotype, using a close analogy to us from the field of IT. <br><blockquote>  <i>Suppose a sysadmin leaves a company with a well-developed IT system ‚Äî several servers, software, network equipment, and telephony.</i>  <i>Who should he take as a substitute?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And here the owner of the company decides - I‚Äôll take my buddy-marketer - he installed the boxed Windows, so he has experience.</i>  <i>And in general, the system has already been adjusted, but you don‚Äôt need to maintain much of your mind - a universal ‚Äúreset‚Äù technique is enough, the old admin always did it.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>For some time everything will work by inertia, the new employee will report on the next successfully completed calendar period of work, will receive his award.</i>  <i>But if at least one really complicated accident arises for which the reboot of the equipment will not be enough, will it eliminate it?</i>  <i>Can he develop the system?</i> <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Not to develop is to degrade.</b>  These are the laws of both IT and business in general. <br><br>  Of course, you need to hire only those who can understand the many interrelationships of the elements of the system, and their internal settings, possible modes of operation.  We need someone who can build a model of the system in her head, and therefore, if necessary, and recreate it.  For example, if a virus or intruders destroyed everything. <br><br>  In our example, someone who positions himself as a humanist (marketer, historian, philosopher, journalist) is not suitable for managing an IT system.  If IT was not interested in IT before, then it is unlikely that it will even delve into the new job while everything works by inertia. <br>  As soon as something breaks, he will move to another place of work ‚Äî not to waste his life on creating an uninteresting system for him, which he does not fully understand, and does not want to understand. <br><br>  In addition to this ‚Äúpsychological‚Äù argument, I have suspicions that it is in fact only a manifestation (rationalization) of a deeper reason. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/272617/">Not everyone can be programmers</a> , not everyone can be theoretical physicists, not everyone can fit in his head a large technical system.  Not everyone can fit in his head a system that represents relationships in the work of the divisions of a large organization.  Not in the sense of someone who has hooked someone, who has a relative, where financial flows take place, etc., but the interconnection of units in the production process.  Otherwise, E. Goldratt would not have to write a series of ‚ÄúThe Goal ...‚Äù. <br>  Why, there - not always the director can realize what kind of service his company produces.  If Yandex couldn‚Äôt understand ‚Äúwhat it is worth‚Äù the ‚ÄúFilm Search‚Äù it bought and decided to turn it into another online cinema ... <br><br>  Why is it important to fully understand the work of the entire organization?  Because otherwise, its work cannot be optimized - the already mentioned E. Goldratt in his ‚ÄúTheory of Constraints‚Äù proves that independent sequential optimization of individual sections will <u>guarantee</u> non-optimal work of the whole enterprise. <br><br>  However, even if it is not optimal, at least there was some kind of work.  But our case is harder. <br><br>  So, for the new director, the work of some divisions is a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù, i.e.  he understands only the inputs and outputs, the requirements-requests and the desired results.  He may mistakenly believe that he understands them or understands them in 5 minutes ‚Äúif necessary‚Äù - here <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D1%258E%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">the Dunning-Kruger effect will</a> help him. <br><br>  For example, for a new marketing director, IT will be the black box.  Here we will keep this situation in mind. <br><br>  Let's see how trying to manage a partially incomprehensible company, the new director will lead her to destruction. <br><br><h2>  3. Such unreliable reporting </h2><br>  To manage the need information about the state of the company.  And here comes a huge problem - how can you make sure that the reporting is correct? <br><br>  <b>Reporting on the results achieved, the current state, and especially the forecasts, are worth something only if they were made by an expert to whom there is confidence.</b>  <b>More precisely - if there is confidence in the entire chain of information processing, coming from reliable primary sources.</b> <br><br>  I will give 4 examples <br><br>  1. About Beeline write: <br><blockquote>  <a href="https://www.iguides.ru/main/services/vimpelcom_poteryal_1_milliard_dollarov_na_korruptsii/">"... all statements of the company about business, operating activities and prospects cannot be considered correct</a> . <a href="https://www.iguides.ru/main/services/vimpelcom_poteryal_1_milliard_dollarov_na_korruptsii/">"</a> <br>  And do not recognize the income of a billion dollars!  <a href="https://lenta.ru/news/2016/02/19/vimpelcom/">And they take a fine of 750 million dollars!</a> <br></blockquote><br>  2. An example of the state.  management: <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://kungurov.livejournal.com/131860.html">... all experts make forecasts only in accordance with what the authorities want to see.</a>  I work in the AP six years.  During this time, hundreds of analyzes, forecasts and plans have passed through my hands.  I have not seen ANY negative forecast during this time.  All the experts sing in chorus "Everything is fine, beautiful marquise ...". <br></blockquote><br>  3. And here is my favorite Satyam / Maytas case, with expensive, very expensive <s>leeches</s> from PWC auditors: <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://fictionbook.ru/author/maks_bazerman/iskusstvo_zamechat_sekretyi_nablyudateln/read_online.html%3Fpage%3D4">On January 7, 2009, Raju announced to the board of directors of the company that he had been manipulating financial statements for many years.</a>  In the end, he confessed that in total he had overstated the company's assets in the financial statements by $ 1.47 billion.  For several years, the company's revenues were ‚Äúadjusted‚Äù almost every quarter. <br>  PricewaterhouseCoopers has been auditing Satyam reports since June 2000, right up to fraud recognition - that is, about nine years.  Interestingly, Satyam paid for PWC audit services almost twice the average price for the industry.  If one of the four largest audit firms for nine years did not notice this large-scale fraud ‚Äî and Merrill Lynch discovered it in less than ten days ‚Äî it is worth taking an interest in the integrity of the auditing industry. <br></blockquote><br>  4. About the fake reporting in the Soviet era, you can search for the keyword "postscript". <br><br><h2>  4. Parallel management structures </h2><br>  The problem of trust in reporting from the category of eternal, <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">... and one of its possible solutions has the same limitation period.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚Äú <a href="http://putnik1.livejournal.com/4686616.html">Of all the arts, the most difficult thing is the art of reigning ...</a> How often it is beneficial for four or five advisors to unite and deceive their sovereign!  He is fenced off from people by high dignity, and therefore the truth is hidden from him;  he can only see with their eyes, he hears only their false explanations.  He puts on the most important posts vicious and weak, and keeps virtuous and worthy subjects in disfavor.  Because of such shameful tricks, the best, the wisest rulers are rendered helpless before the corruption and corruption of the courtiers. ‚Äù <br>  It is not surprising that Diocletian considered his solution to this difficult question to be his main task, which he eventually found.  He correctly reasoned that it is easy to deceive one, two more difficult, and four, if they are honest and like-minded, is impossible at all, he called his most faithful, brave and reliable friend and shared with him power over the Empire, not dividing the Empire itself, after which both of them they chose two young, talented, reliable generals and adopted them, thereby transferring to him a portion of the Farrah and making him co-rulers. </div></div><br>  <b>The new director himself as his subordinates and advisers will invite their "proven people."</b> <br><br>  By the same principle, the process of leadership change cascades to the lower levels of power in the Company ... <br><br>  But you can't just take off and remove the old leaders of the black boxes.  Suddenly, they are doing something important, and the time for ‚Äútheir own‚Äù to accept current affairs needs to be given. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/01/28/625816-mts-po-novomu-vzglyanula-regioni">All managers can be immediately removed unless the branches, before closing them.</a> <br><br><img align="left" width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3f/fcf/4c5/b3ffcf4c53ef46ffbf514edfec540d9a.gif"><br>  Therefore, inviting your friends to senior positions translates into an increase in the company's management staff and the creation of parallel management structures. <br><br>  The new structures created for soft interception of company management, trying to understand business processes will load divisions with additional expanded reporting.  In essence, it will be confusing reporting - in order for reporting to be sensible, you must thoroughly understand the production process.  The reaction to confused work is irritation from the additional ‚Äúwork in the trash can‚Äù, a decrease in trust in the company‚Äôs management, and a reduction in the quality of work is possible (as the management still does not understand what the work is). <br><br clear="all">  <i>Plans for a hidden replacement of management personnel can grow to the restructuring of the entire organizational structure, ostensibly for the sake of efficiency.</i>  <i>Type really did not have time to enter, but already found inefficiency.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In this case, there are risks to get even more chaos - up to a misunderstanding of who submits to whom, how the new divisions and new posts are called, and for what the person is responsible "here in this post."</i> <br><br><h2>  5. Additional control over financial flows </h2><br>  For financial flows, the director will need separate special control.  Remember about unreliable reporting?  Therefore, new <u>additional</u> contours of control over financial flows will be created. <br>  All purchases must be coordinated by a committee of people checked by the new director.  So that everyone and everything will buy only from the right suppliers. <br>  And how will the new trusted people figure out, is it necessary to buy something requested for work from the ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù at all, or can they be denied and thereby saved? <br>  And let's arrange another committee for this to protect the need for procurement, etc.  We will meet once a month. <br><br>  The result is a slowdown in the production process, real financial losses from delays in deliveries ... But no one will take this into account. <br><br><h2>  6. Black box.  Where does the need for staff reductions come from </h2><br>  The new director will put his people in high positions, in the central office - s / n, premium, and other status support must be at the highest level, otherwise what will be their <u>influence</u> , who will listen and respect them? <br>  He will also need to find funds for a higher premium to the board of directors - they control his work, and should feel positive trends in their pocket. <br>  And also gold parachutes fired from the old team ... <br>  <i>So, something is already too much spending coming out.</i>  <i>Golden parachutes should be cut off, and it is better without scandal, "of their own will."</i>  <i>Put pressure on their ... conscience.</i> <br><br>  <b>An increase in the staff of top managers is burdening PLT, and the new director hardly promised the owners an increase in personnel costs, rather the opposite</b> . <br><br>  Therefore, no matter how cool you are, in order to maintain the same level of financing as personnel costs, you will inevitably have to make a decision about a small reduction in ‚Äúworker bees‚Äù. <br>  How are we going to cut - the same percentage for all divisions, or will we figure it out, and we will reduce only the ‚Äúwrong bees‚Äù that bring little honey?  You understand that it is simply indecent to ask such a question to an efficient manager.  So the question is how to distinguish the drones from the right bees. <br><blockquote>  <i>We give a task: each manager must compile a report on the work of his subdivisions, in which he <u>will prove</u> with the help of calculations the amount of resources he needs.</i>  <i>Decompose the work into elementary actions, multiplies by coefficients of labor intensity, etc.</i>  <i>At the same time and find out who does what, what processes the company lives.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So, we look ... In native and clear areas everything is normal, well done.</i>  <i>Well, in some places attributed, but in moderation.</i>  <i>Here is a reserve for the planned development of the direction, and this is a buffer for training young personnel ... Everything is justified, manageable.</i>  <i>OK, accepted.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  And what about the "black boxes", are now transparent? <br>  Nope  They bring calculations, but they are still not clear how to check.  They muddy the water about different personal productivity of programmers, about training, stretched for 2 years. <br>  They lead to an average level of performance, and it turns out that they should not be reduced, but should be expanded! <br><br><blockquote>  There is nothing to catch, but obviously they are lying - they are now doing their work with a smaller number. <br>  <i>Insolent.</i>  <i>No, I feel that we will not work together.</i> <br><br>  <i>Why did they write nonsense, they told you that drivers should be simple, clear to management.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Listen to me - you still need to cut.</i>  <i>Difficult economic times in the country, it is necessary to increase efficiency.</i>  <i>We will not reduce sales units, they bring revenue, and your units only consume, you have only expenses in terms of indicators.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We are one team.</i>  <i>What exactly can you do for the company?</i>  <i>Cost Savings?</i>  <i>Well, here and save.</i>  <i>Especially now it is important to save staff costs.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Stop the idle talk, what obligations to reduce your unit you take on yourself?</i>  <i>You are the manager, understand yourself who to cut.</i>  <i>Yes, under your responsibility - we are talking about your area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility.</i>  <i>No, it is not ambitious enough.</i>  <i>Either you can do it, or if someone else does it in your place, there will always be those who are willing to find such a salary.</i>  <i>Twice more cut?</i>  <i>Until what date do you intend to complete the reduction?</i>  <i>OK, take action.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  And they will no longer argue, and they will fulfill the order ... that is, <u>their</u> reduction <u>goal</u> . <br>  If ‚Äútheir people‚Äù the new director comes to leadership positions from small companies, then they may not be ready for the increased flexibility of downstream managers ( <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/20202/">see clause 2.2</a> ).  Focusing on the usual amount of feedback from subordinates, they easily bent over in their "reforms". <br><br>  And in the reporting will be "everything is fine," until the very end - because  responsibility for the success of the cuts was shifted to the managers of the black boxes. <br>  Besides, to whom should they now talk about internal problems?  Those who previously did not want to listen to their arguments, those who in fact created these problems, but shifted responsibility from themselves to them?  And what will it do besides harm? <br><br>  We fix: <br>  <b>The new director will strive first and foremost to reduce what he does not understand, that for him he is a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù.</b> <br>  <b>Psychological pressure, he will seek from the leaders of the "black boxes" consent to the reduction of their employees.</b> <br>  <b>The black box managers will have to independently develop plans to reduce their units and take responsibility for all subsequent risks of their implementation.</b> <br><br><h2>  7. False optimization criterion ‚ÄúCost minimization‚Äù </h2><br>  The reductions will take place under the flag of increasing efficiency, otherwise, but due to a lack of understanding of the internal laws of the functioning of ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù, they will not even be able to formulate criteria for this efficiency, except for the poor ‚Äúcost minimization‚Äù. <br>  Minimizing costs is not at all a criterion of efficiency.  The criterion should either be a nonlinear function with a minimum at a non-zero cost, or be supplemented by reasonable restrictions on the allowable range of values ‚Äã‚Äãof its arguments.  Otherwise, the desired value will be found at the point where "costs = 0".  And this is a stopping point, the death of an enterprise, which has nothing to do with the optimal mode of its operation. <br><br>  <b>The goal of minimizing costs without additional reasonable restrictions is the goal of destruction.</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>Oh, effectively how the company will earn, if all of them are reduced and left in the staff of one director.</i>  <i>EBITDA as trampling up ... all competitors will be envious.</i> <br></blockquote><br><br><h2>  8. Abbreviations in the branches </h2><br>  Personnel cuts will take place primarily in the branches, for each manager strives to have his subordinates nearby.  He knows them, emotional contact is established with them, they are really useful to him, it‚Äôs pitiful to cut them. <br><blockquote>  <i>What are they doing in the provinces?</i>  <i>We are poorly seen from the Capital, but there is a reasonable suspicion that they relaxed there.</i>  <i>So they can be, they are not sorry, and the cries of those being reduced to us will not reach - our sleep will be calmer.</i> <i><br></i> <br></blockquote><br>  <b>The main downsizing is in black boxes in the branches</b> <br><br>  ... and it may turn out to be unexpectedly high. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">We will carry out a model calculation ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Abstract company for 10 thousand people.  The head office in Moscow is 2 thousand plus 8 thousand - branches in the regions of the country. <br>  Board of Directors of 10 people. <br>  Black boxes - 50% of the total (the lower the percentage, the worse they will be). <br><br>  We hire 10 "our" trusted managers in the head office in Moscow.  This is only an increase in the total number of 0.1%.  But you need 1 million of costs for each "own" per month.  There is nothing less - top management, Capital (I know that in reality is higher). <br>  A specialist in the province costs 50 tr.  per month (z / p + premium). <br>  Therefore it is necessary to reduce these provincials in the ratio of 1:20 - i.e.  total we cut the number of 200 "units." <br>  200 out of 4000 thousand is 5%.  Tolerant.  You can simply freeze the job, and the natural loss of employees will do everything herself. <br>  Oh, I forgot about the award to the Board of Directors.  Annual bonus, at least twenty each more than usual.  Total 200 million - i.e.  minus another 8% - this is 330 "established units."  In the army, enemy soldiers are not called people, but ‚Äúliving force‚Äù - so that conscience does not interfere with killing.  With similar goals in slang, HR employees are called ‚Äústaff units‚Äù or ‚Äúresources‚Äù. <br>  So you need to make cuts of 13% in these provincial black boxes. <br>  To wait until 13% go away for a long time, but they can hint, for example, cut down the social package. <br>  This is a model calculation, in life it will surely soften - they will cut a little and the ‚Äúwhite bone‚Äù in Moscow;  will reduce not only the number, but also a premium in the branches.  They will try not to overstep the psychological barrier of 10% (15%, 20% ...). <br>  For a larger reduction, it would be good to have a reinforced concrete foundation, but we have just the case when doubts remain.  (I would know for what - I would kill, and so - from you so far only 10%). <br></div></div><br>  I also propose to consider the truth of a stronger statement: <br>  Almost always, reductions in a large successful company in Russia are associated with the desire of top management to increase their salaries and bonuses. <br>  I ask you only to distinguish such cuts from the filtering mechanisms of the labor market, when the same Google or MS gains thousands, and thousands periodically dismiss. <br><br>  Take into account that there is such a rule for large stable companies - the total wage fund (FOT) should not grow faster than the total profit.  In this payroll, both billions are added up for bonuses to members of the Board of Directors, and pennies on ordinary staff salaries.  According to my estimates, top management easily eats from 20% to 35% of the total payroll.  And in our country, inflation ... and influential boys want to compensate for it ... but they can do it only at the expense of the rest ... <br><br><h2>  9.

Western consulting companies </h2><br>  The new leadership will feel that it does not have the credibility of the old employees who understand their site of work thoroughly (and even more so - several sites). <br>  Once I saw the results of an anonymous independent survey among employees - the statistics there was such that the longer the employee worked at the company, i.e.  the more he understood exactly how it worked, the less he had confidence in the actions of the new leadership. <br>  You understand that relying on such results of the survey will only increase the desire of the new leadership to get rid of these inert clever people who are resisting their ‚Äúingenious‚Äù designs to do ‚Äúas they were taught at MBA‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>A typical solution to the problem of a lack of technical knowledge in a new director and his team is the assistance of western consulting companies.</b> <br><br>  Already with their help the director is not afraid of any deception from the ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù. <br>  At the same time, these ‚Äúblacks‚Äù will have less nose to bully in front of the new leadership. <br><br>  <abbr title="It does not mean the famous meme">A friend of mine</abbr> told me about Beeline that financing the costs of network development there is carried out according to a certain ‚ÄúDevelopment Model‚Äù, which for Beeline was developed by consultants from the international consulting company McKinsey. <br><br>  Everything supposedly happens like this: <br><blockquote>  Detailed plans for the development of the company and the layout of the necessary expenses for the next year, calculated by Beeline‚Äôs technical specialists for each region, are given to McKinsey consultants ‚Äúfor verification‚Äù.  And they answer, it corresponds to all of their ‚ÄúDevelopment Models‚Äù, or else it is necessary to reduce the planned costs somewhere, since  Required too much. <br>  Their model McKinsey kept secret even from the leadership of Beeline, the reason is called ridiculous - so that the technicians of Beeline could not, having studied the model, find a way to "deceive her", and therefore the management of the company.  Yes, yes, and then deceived, and they purchase unnecessary equipment, and the connection will be better than necessary, and EBITDA - lower than possible. <br></blockquote><br>  Guess what this secrecy really hides? <br>  There are no such secret models.  If the model were, then in this case - only linear, and for one, maximum two budget campaigns, all its coefficients could still be calculated. <br><br>  Most likely, McKinsey does not conduct calculations for its invisible model, which does not exist.  Instead, McKinsey consultants take the calculations of Beeline experts and tell Beeline‚Äôs management where to cut costs, i.e.  degrade network quality in the medium term. <br>  Beeline paid for the development of the model, but instead received external control from a foreign company. <br><br>  <b>Transferring responsibility for financial and organizational decisions on technical units to Western consulting companies leads to a situation of external management, and without any responsibility for the decisions made.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Yes, this management is not tough, and has big limitations, but if you influence slowly, then in a few years ... we get the result: Beeline ditched its IT, Beeline sells towers, management does not believe in the prospects of the company and the wireless communications industry as a whole. <br>  Oh yes, the ability to directly blow in the ears of a technically illiterate leadership decides a lot. <br><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/icover/blog/270222/">Google believes</a> in the prospects of wireless communications, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/238101/">Facebook believes</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/241172/">Ilon Musk</a> believes, and Beeline now lost faith. <br>  Do you know what Google, Facebook and SpaceX might need to create a good network of billions of subscribers in addition to their satellites, balloons and gliders?  <u>Ground infrastructure.</u>  The one that Beeline and MegaFon are now thinking of selling.  Plus it would be good to get a data transport network in the kit. <br>  Hmm, an American consulting company recommends selling towers that American companies will need in a few years ... Is there a match here? <br><br>  The second variant of events - if Google really gets <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/29/project-skybender-google-drone-tests-internet-spaceport-virgin-galactic">the exchange rate between drones more than 4G 40 times</a> , then the use of ground infrastructure for it will lose its meaning. <br><br>  In this case, the partial loss of control over their infrastructure by the opsox still plays into Google‚Äôs hands - there is a way to convert it into a deterioration in the quality of services, their appreciation, and hence the subscribers ‚Äôreadiness to switch to the Google network (albeit less speed, but flat tariffs or free , and works more stable). <br><br>  By the way, another ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù - the Boston Consulting Group - is engaged in personnel management in Beeline. <br>  Implements the principles of regulating the number of IT and technical staff, according to which once a year there is an adjustment - to dismiss or redeem specialists.  It's so great when IT positions or techies are reduced to open them again and recruit new employees in a year.  They are just like janitors - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D6pV-8q6JZTs">a new form has been issued</a> , 1 day for training - showed the site, and on the 2nd day 100% return is already from them, right, right? <br><br>  <b>McKinsey and BCG present MelaFon and MTS for Beeline‚Äôs ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù as an exemplary, already run-in, successful optimization of the company.</b> <br><br>  If you say that I‚Äôve gotten too close to it, that there can‚Äôt be such that Beeline is run by foreign consulting companies, then it turns out that <a href="http://andrey-ka23.livejournal.com/946103.html">you don‚Äôt know exactly about this</a> . <br>  You do not know that the <a href="http://www.eg.ru/daily/politics/45827/">US Central Bank is governed by the United States</a> , and that in all the ministries of the Russian Federation, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Delloitte, Ernst &amp; Young are engaged in consulting and auditing. <br>  You do not know that even the laws of the Russian Federation are <a href="http://www.promved.ru/articles/article.phtml%3Fid%3D1463%26nomer%3D51">developed with the money of these consultants</a> , more precisely, they are both the sponsor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRGkYjsqYQJw">and the developers</a> . <br><br>  In these conditions, on the contrary, it would be strange if Beeline were independent. <br><br>  I agree with the opinion that headings like <a href="http://publizist.ru/login/return_url/64-L2Jsb2dzLzEwODI2NS8xMTM4MS8t">Killing us with our hands are the goal of America</a> , too ‚Äúyellow‚Äù. <br>  I do not think that pragmatic people will go to such extremes.  But our place in the global economy is clearly not advanced, and <u>managing the</u> competitiveness of Russian enterprises is the mandatory goal of foreign consulting companies. <br>  <b>The goal of foreign consulting companies is to build Russian companies into the global economy in the place that think tanks have identified to them of the Western elite.</b>  And so that no one jumped above the bar they set, did not create unnecessary competition to Western companies. <br>  For example, one may assign the role of an <a href="http://www.aif.ru/politics/world/posol_ssha_potreboval_ot_ukrainy_stat_selskohozyaystvennoy_superderzhavoy">agricultural superpower</a> , and the other the role of a gas superpower.  And why non-core enterprises such superpowers? <br><br>  At this moment we will stop - this was an article about the typical mistakes of people who turned out to be ‚Äúnot according to Senka's hat‚Äù, but a separate conversation is needed about the advice of the consultants. <br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Further in the program: </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/312702/">Councils of Western consulting companies.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/312702/">Part 1.</a> </li><li>  What should the new director do to correct the consequences of the board of the previous pseudo-effective manager and his team. </li></ul><br><hr><br>  UPD.  2016.03.10 - Corrected the errors. <br><br>  UPD.  2016.10.27 - Put a link to the continuation of the article - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/312702/">Tips of Western consulting companies.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/312702/">Part 1</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297678/</a></p>
