      Lars was not from Friday to Monday.  Silence was the answer to all requests.  He returned refreshed and ... surprised that he (oh, marvel!) Is still waiting for these strange Russians! <br>  True, he immediately confirmed his participation in the online final part of the marathon.  Results below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3c/ecb/cfd/a3cecbcfd06dbbb987aee01dfb73499d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  gdd09ru, Lars Rasmussen and Stephanie Hennon with vadbars, sergey.moiseev, Poseidon, elGephest, Den4 <br><br>  <b>Ask Lars - online!</b> <br><br>  Start online on December 2nd at 11:00 MSK! <br><br>  Holds <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/kyiv-gtug-center%3Fpli%3D1">Kyiv GTUG Center</a> <br>  Marathon team: Vladimir Ivanov (elGephest), Maxim Vasilyev (qMax), Oleg Bozhenko (mrGALL), Vadim Barsukov (vadbars). <br>  Wave-Marathon announced on the official blog of <a href="http://google-ukraine-blog.blogspot.com/">Google Ukraine</a> <br>  Basic electronic resource: <a href="http://ukrwaves.com/">Ukrainian Hvil</a> <br>  Informational partner: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-wave-russia%3Flnk%3D">Google Wave Russia</a> <br>  Information sponsor: <a href="http://www.itc.ua/node/42633">ITC.UA</a> <br>  Prize Fund Sponsor: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">Habrahabr</a> <br><br>  elGephest: <br>  <b>Hello!</b> <b><br></b>  <b>This happened!</b> <b><br></b>  <b>we start online with lars</b> <b><br></b>  <b>First, he will answer the few remaining questions (so that everyone remembers why they came)</b> <b><br></b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Ya_bodya: <br>  <b>Google Chrome is very innovative and supports not yet fully approved HTML5, which indicates that Google is not satisfied with the standards that exist on the Internet today.</b>  <b>Based on this question: How would Google and you, in particular, want to create the Internet (redo it or re-create it) if you don‚Äôt need to think at all about backward compatibility with everything that is already created for the Internet and work in it?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Lars: <br>  First, we would never sacrifice backward compatibility.  The best feature of the Web - the availability of a very large amount of information and without backward compatibility is necessary. <br>  We believe that more and more applications and services will start to live on the Internet, and they will be rich or richer than traditional desktop applications.  The web is the OS in our understanding.  Web or cloud computing has much more potential than services limited to one computer ... <br><br>  Denis Sheremetov: <br>  <b>Was the wave idea born as a continuation of the concepts of SemanticWeb or is it something else?</b> <br><br>  Lars: <br>  I do not think so.  We use many of the same techniques that made Google a great search engine, spell checker and (soon) for translation.  We use machine learning and statistical linguistics for this ... <br><br>  Denis Sheremetov <br>  <b>To clarify, I mean agents, as well as work on the spell checker, which seemed to me more lexical analyzer from the presentation, if it shows good results, it is theoretically possible to build ontologies based on the wave, are there any works in this direction?</b> <br><br>  Lars: <br>  Not yet, but we discussed it.  We have a team (we call them ‚Äúvagrants‚Äù) for just such things ... <br><br>  Denis Sheremetov: <br>  <b>But in your opinion, when can it be said that the wave project has already exceeded expectations?</b> <br><br>  Lars: <br>  Hmm, it will take some time :) I have high hopes for Wave.  I think [it will happen then] when Wave takes as much or more space in our heads / minds than E-mail for my generation.  Thousands of Wave providers, perhaps billions of users (not all in Google Wave, of course, but in some Wave systems).  My brother Jens sometimes describes our wildest dream, when Wave will be for the digital world what paper for analog has become.  This is a very big dream :) <br><br>  Light Templar (aalexander@googlewave.com): <br>  <b>Is it possible right now to add to the wave tools for a ban of certain bots and accounts and give access to them to people who have already proven themselves well here?</b> <br><br>  Lars: <br>  It will be.  We know that we are still very weak in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãrights and control.  In practice, this makes public waves a bit complex.  We are working very hard on different tools and we hope to launch some of them in this or next month. <br><br>  elGephest <br>  <b>Is there an ideological affinity between Google Maps and Google Wave?</b>  <b>If so, what is it?</b> <br><br>  Lars: <br>  In both cases, we tried to find areas that were popular, but somewhat inert.  And then we tried to start from scratch, and not to improve the existing paradigms.  Of course, we like to think that both Maps and Wave help move the Web forward.  We are trying to be at the limit of browser capabilities and hope that this will push browser developers to improve the Web in such a way that our type of applications will become really natural for development. <br><br>  elGephest <br>  <b>Great, probably, to work as a brother?</b>  <b>Lars - tell me about Jens!)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>What are you different in what are you like?</b> <br><br>  Lars: <br>  Sometimes working together is difficult.  We argue a lot :) But it seems that good things come out of these disputes.  It helps that we are quite different and have different strengths.  Jens always has great, fantastic ideas.  And I'm better at performance.  We agreed from the very beginning that we would share all awards (money, fame or whatever) equally and always always put friendship above work.  That is what makes our work possible ... <br><br>  elGephest <br>  <b>If it were not for programming, what occupation in life would you choose?</b> <br><br>  Lars: <br>  I once wanted to become a veterinarian.  Also thinking about politics.  I learned math, but not good enough in this. <br><br>  elGephest: <br>  <b>Google Maps - two Danes, Google Wave - two Danes, Gogle Chrome - another Danes.</b>  <b>Lars - comment!)</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Lars: <br>  Ha ha :) I'm not sure.  I noticed that the level of Lars in Google is quite stable since my arrival 5.5 years ago - 1 Lars per 2,000 Google employees. <br><br>  elGephest: <br>  <b>Ta-damm!</b>  The last question of our marathon with Lars Rasmussen and the Wave-bridge Kiev-Sydney! <br><br>  <b>"Everythyng's shiny, Cap'n"?</b> <br><br>  Lars: <br>  HA!  Still: do not worry!  I recommend everyone to watch the movie ‚ÄúSerenity‚Äù, although I will deny any connection between this movie and the name of my product :) But this is also a great movie :) <br><br>  elGephest: <br>  <b>OK, if you liked it with us - invite your fellow countryman and namesake from the founder of Google Chrome, Lars Bak, from your own and our name to the next Wave Marathon.</b>  <b>And right here and now we are sending our invitation with the hope of a positive response to the product manager of Google Wave (and earlier - Google Mail) Stephanie Hannon!</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Lars: <br>  Ok, I'll ask ... No promises. <br><br>  elGephest: <br>  <b>Thank you, Lars!</b> <b><br></b>  <b>And who is the BEST?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Lars: <br>  Look below) (he has already managed to post his list) <br><br>  elGephest: <br>  <b>Thanks, Cap'n!</b> <br><br>  Lars: <br>  No, no, thank you for organizing this marathon!  And thanks for your great questions!  I really enjoyed answering your questions today and during the past week. <br>  I'm afraid that in any case, I already have to go.  Thanks again to everyone for their interest in the wave.  I know, it's still very green and damp, but I promise, we are working hard to bring everything in proper shape for launch next year.  Best wishes to all of you (especially those with whom we met at GDD in Moscow - this is a vivid impression of our trip to Europe!) <br><br>  elGephest: <br>  <b>Thank you, Lars!</b>  <b>Thanks for the Wave and for our real Wave Marathon!</b>  <b>We started in the fall - and now it's winter!</b>  <b>Hello from Sydney Kiev!</b> <br><br>  Lars: <br>  Fine!  You guys are great!  I hope to meet again!  Happy swimming on the wave! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77303/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77303/</a></p>
