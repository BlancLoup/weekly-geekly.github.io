  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Denmark: Country of Victory of Common Sense</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For six months now, I live in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark.  In this article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/yasno_tv/">I</a> want to show why I consider this country to be the kingdom of the undecided. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTrust but verify‚Äù is about Denmark. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  The trust </h5><br>  In the shopping center under the strange name "Magasin" I asked how they control the theft - because surveillance cameras are not visible at all.  The answer was simple - but there are no cameras.  At some stage, they came to the conclusion that the level of thefts does not exceed the permissible threshold, and it is <i>more profitable for</i> them <i>to</i> refuse to observe and simply trust people. <br><br>  Somehow I decided to rent a boat ride through the canal.  When I asked which documents to bring, they answered no, ‚Äúwe in Denmark trust people‚Äù was the answer.  It is understandable - you can‚Äôt swim away far away on the oars anyway, but it is captivating, you won‚Äôt say anything.

      If the taxi driver says that ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs about CZK 200, it will turn out‚Äù, then 150 can come out. <br><br>  In the subway there are no turnstiles - just get on the train and go. <br><br><h5>  Control </h5><br>  Trust does not mean licentiousness.  Danes are all very well controlled. <br><br>  On the one hand, the police are almost invisible - an annoying police / police squad, as we do, at each metro station, no.  GAI I have never seen. <br><br>  On the other hand, there are verifiers.  For example, the fact that there are no turnstiles in the metro does not mean that everyone strives to drive a hare.  Just the opposite.  A special checker walks and carefully, not forgetting to smile and thank, looks at the tickets.  Those who have run out of tickets, or those who have forgotten to pay for transporting a bicycle, are displayed on the platform and they are charged with a considerable fine - 700 kroons ($ 125). <br><br>  My colleague was once charged with a red light bike ride - 1000 kroons ($ 175). <br><br>  The travel ticket on the metro is made in such a way that you do not undermine it: it‚Äôs such a plastic book, on the one hand a permanent ticket listing the available metro areas and your photo, on the other hand a removable ticket for the current month, and the control number for both parts is the same. <br><br>  I saw 2 people in uniform and a flashlight walking down my street in the evening - checking parking tickets under the windshield. <br><br><h5>  true </h5><br>  As is known, in the USSR there was neither sex nor prostitution, nor homosexuality, nor drug addiction.  Everyone, of course, understands that they were present and that those in power, using statistics and fraud, tried to make a good face on a bad game. <br><br>  In Denmark is not the case.  In the station area, in the evenings, there are black women, in the city annually gay parades are held, in the central quarter and at the same time the self-proclaimed country of Christiania you can freely and cheap buy a shovel.  However, the authorities do not pretend that this is not the case - they chose to localize the problem: you can smoke in Christiania, but preferably only there. <br><br><h5>  People </h5><br>  The standard Russian rich man is, as a rule, an insolent pot-bellied guy in a jeep.  The standard rich Dane - in very good sports form, smiling, taking the subway or taxi.  In the line of my bosses and investors, everyone runs 10 km in no more than an hour, many running marathons.  In general, sport is very popular - on the way home I meet up to a dozen runners, even now in January. <br><br>  Most Danes, from teenagers to old women, speak English. <br><br>  All on the drum, how you look and what you do.  I saw girls in a fur coat and on heels riding a bicycle (we wouldn't have it in our head somehow).  In addition to regular bicycles, adult guys can ride bicycles, scooters, and roller skates with a skate, and even ski sticks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d6/780/d21/9d6780d21258107c61583ef5016a0759.jpg"><br><br>  Let me compare Russian and Danish programmers.  From my experience, the authorities can play on the sense of responsibility of the Slavic engineer, and when finding an important bug, our person can decide to stay after work and finish with an all-rounder.  And the Dane will responsibly begin tomorrow with a fresh mind. <br><br><h5>  Study </h5><br>  What struck: students of the department of architecture do graduation works not on abstract themes, but design real architectural forms that will stand in Copenhagen.  They can poke a finger into the map of the city and say that, they say, there will be parking for bicycles near the central square, the sketch of which I am now drawing. <br><br><h5>  Power </h5><br>  In general, such an <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD_X_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8)">urban legend is</a> indicative: in the Second World War, Denmark surrendered without a fight, but when the Nazis ordered the Jews to put on patches with the ‚ÄúStar of David‚Äù, the Danish king put it on publicly, and simple Danes followed it. <br><br>  I remember driving a convoy of some bumps.  No traffic jams for several hours - 4 motorcyclists drove up, blocked the key points of the intersection, showed them with signs to those who did not understand or did not see, stop.  A motorcade drove past, and in front of them was another four motorcyclists who went to block the next intersection.  Starred - went.  The whole procedure took 1.5-2 minutes. <br><br>  I was impressed by this photo at the exhibition (sorry for the quality).  It depicts Jens Otto Krogh, who at that very moment took the post of prime minister.  At the same time in the foreground is visible the erased sole of his shoes.  Maybe, of course, PR is like Obama's cheap watches, but impressive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90f/5b7/da6/90f5b7da6d366c1bbf700ef1515b1419.jpg"><br><br>  About the army.  I once talked to a Dane who served in Afghanistan.  This cheerful guy recalled contract service as a resort - yes, they were shooting, but they had everything - the best provision and food, good housing, a big salary.  Wants to go yet. <br><br><h5>  Technology </h5><br>  Metro - one of the best in the world, unmanned, that is, front and rear - the windshield;  the tunnels are brightly illuminated, so that the front seat has a great overview. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82f/95c/d8c/82f95cd8c46d1854d22780f08a15e79b.jpg"><br><br>  You can buy a ticket on the subway by SMS. <br><br>  In the suburban trains S-Train is wi-fi. <br><br>  Beautifully organized queues.  You come up, press a button on the device, take a ticket with a serial number that appears and wait until it appears on the scoreboard (usually quickly).  With us, this also begins to appear, and here it is everywhere - in the ministry, in the exchanger at the station, and in the post office, and in the confectionery.  A technique like ‚ÄúI only ask‚Äù loses its meaning. <br><br>  Another sketch of an established system.  I didn‚Äôt complete the scheduled payment in the client bank.  So that I find out about this, the bank sent me a notice by paper mail.  I received this letter in the evening of the same day. <br><br>  Speaking of letters.  When you deliver a letter to the post office, the sender‚Äôs address is crossed out with a pen - in order to save time on the ‚Äúparsing‚Äù of the recipient‚Äôs address. <br><br><h5>  Water saving </h5><br>  In Kiev, there is a place - "Museum of Water".  So, it was created with the support of the Danish Ministry of the Environment to raise public awareness about the value of water resources. <br><br>  In Denmark, almost no baths.  The bathroom is usually very small, combined with a toilet.  Thus, the Danes save water. <br><br>  Drinking water flows from the tap here - it‚Äôs not a sin to save. <br><br><h5>  Electronic money </h5><br>  Then I was somehow given a cool wallet, but the irony is that it is not needed in Denmark.  I take it out only when I fly to other countries.  As a rule, with me I have to carry only a bank card, well, plus a travel card.  You can pay with the card almost everywhere - not only in shopping centers, but also at the post office, in the sandwich maker, and in the taxi. <br><br>  You can not pay with a card only for travel on the bus (alternatively, the subway and the S-Train) and everything that is sold from the hands - a thing at the flea market, gifts to Christiania, etc. <br><br><h5>  Transport </h5><br>  The transport system has been established so clearly that there are special sites with which you can pave the route from point A to B with transfers up to minutes.  These include the metro, the S-Train suburban trains, buses and river trams. <br><br>  In S-Train there is a special car for bicycles. <br><br>  Bicycles are a whole song.  I will not tell you for all of Europe, but it seems to me that there are more of them here than, say, in the Netherlands.  And single, and tandems, and with a cradle in front, and with a saddle for the baby in the back, and reclining with pedals in front.  Of course, there is infrastructure for this - everywhere (not only in the center) there are wide bicycle lanes, marking, special traffic lights, and free hoses with compressed air. <br><br><h5>  "Luxury Tax" </h5><br>  Beer in a supermarket costs 8-10 kroons ($ 1.5), in a bar - 50-70 ($ 9). <br><br>  The tax on the purchase of a car is 100-200% (yes, one hundred two hundred percent). <br><br>  In general, the payroll tax is 36-40%, and it is clear where this money is spent.  For example, foreign children who go to the preparatory class of an international school carry a taxi at public expense, and a taxi here is very expensive. <br><br>  In general, Denmark has made a lasting impression on me with its sanity.  I am <a href="http://ru.yasno.tv/">learning</a> from the Danes while doing <a href="http://ru.yasno.tv/">my educational project</a> . <br><br>  If modern Peter I decided to send students to study in Europe, I would wish him to choose this particular country. <br><br>  Continued: <ol><li>  " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181690/">Language learning system in Denmark</a> ", </li><li>  " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/166123/">Moving to work</a> ." </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285526/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285526/</a></p>
