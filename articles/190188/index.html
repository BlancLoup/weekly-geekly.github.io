But I think we could just look at Bookface. <br>  <b>007</b> : What? <br>  <b>M</b> : Bukfeys, haven't you heard of him?  Well, you and the dinosaur, 007. A few years ago, to find out what the people of the country were doing, it was necessary to conduct all sorts of secret operations under cover.  Now you can just look into Bookface. <br>  <b>007</b> : So they tell their secrets?  Idiots <br>  <b>M</b> : I know.  It seems that the average citizens are just happy to share every aspect of their lives, personal information, every opinion, deed and desire.  In exchange for the opportunity to tell friends and family that they have just poked, or to show them a cute little kitty with a funny caption below. <br>  <b>007</b> : So you say, M, that you don‚Äôt need me anymore? <br>  <b>M</b> : No, 007, not needed.  I just connected to Bukface's servers and launched a search for all the people who updated their status and wrote ‚ÄúStole the giant Cosmic Laser ... lol, <abbr title="Weapons of Mass Destruction - weapons of mass destruction">#WMD</abbr> ‚Äù there.

      I am guilty as well as everyone else.  I communicate with my family on Facebook, with my friends on Google+, and with my colleagues on Twitter.  I keep documents in Dropbox, notes in Evernote and photos in Picasa.  My contacts are in iCloud, calendar in Gmail, tasks in Wunderlist, passwords are stored in Lastpass.  I even allowed Apple to track my movements in case I lost my iPad, and Google tracks me when I need to know where to find the nearest McDonalds. <br><br>  I signed up for a myriad of services, they all seem to be ‚Äúfree‚Äù, but in reality, I acquired services by paying with personal data.  It may be outraged that this data is available (by any method) for the NSA in the States, and for the <abbr title="Government Communications Headquarters - Government Communications Center">GCHQ</abbr> in the United Kingdom, but you need to ask yourself - who is really to blame here?  By providing our data to corporations (which are subject to the laws of the countries in which they operate), we have presented overly accessible opportunities to the secret services.  It's like a virgin sheet of dimpled polyethylene, they just can't help it.  They are forced to start pushing these bumps of privacy. <br><br>  Instead of getting angry or upset, I decided to act. <a name="habracut"></a>  Get rid of them all.  Take control of my data and run away from the clouds.  To some extent, the cat has already been taken out of the bag, perhaps with a strange expression of the muzzle and with a funny signature below.  My data is no longer with me, but I can stop distributing it. <br><br>  I'm not going to tie it on the sly.  I will act in the style of the Big Bang.  Get rid of all my online accounts this weekend. <br><br>  1. Facebook - like two fingers.  There I have nothing valuable, so deleting an account is not a problem.  And I mean it is the deletion, not the deactivation.  I have already made this mistake before, while it is too tempting to go back.  Just see who showed or posted a picture of a kitten that looks like it poops. <br><br>  2. Dropbox - harder.  For years I have cherished the 20Gb free space on Dropbox, and it will be sad to part with them.  However, the promise is made, so it should happen.  The first thing you need to find an alternative.  <a href="http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html">BitTorrent Sync</a> , it seems, is still up to it.  I installed it on my MacBook and MacMini and transferred my files to the newly created BTSync directory.  Then logged into Dropbox via the web interface, and deleted the account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c5/834/f54/9c5834f544ed0556f58f0ff7a978bc84.png" alt="Sad dropbox"><br><br>  3. Browser - I use Chrome, and usually logged in to Google.  Installed Firefox and sent Chrome to the Trash. <br><br>  4. Search - no more Google.  It is quite simple.  Removed standard search services from Firefox and installed a search with the strange name <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a> .  I also changed my privacy settings: always in anonymous browsing mode and do not accept cookies. <br><br>  5. Browser plugins - to slightly improve privacy, installed <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/">AdBlock Plus</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/">NoScript</a> . <br><br>  6. Internet - I know that I am not <abbr title="1337 hacker"><i>an</i> hacker</abbr> , but I am almost sure that if I need privacy online - then I will have to hide IP sometimes.  It was once played with Tor, but it's too slow.  Also, I'm not going to use SilkRoad, because  My drug is sold in packs of 4 each in supermarkets.  Chose VPN.  <a href="http://btguard.com/">BTGuard</a> seems to be quite a respected provider, I paid three months in advance and set up a Mac. <br><br>  7. Microsoft - this is simple.  I don't use Skype or Windows, and my XBox account is not connected to anything else.  The only pity is that as one of the first users of Outlook.com, I will lose a couple of cool email addresses.  However, when I try to close my account, it says that I need to cancel paid subscriptions (which I don‚Äôt have), and since there‚Äôs nothing to cancel, I‚Äôm locked in a vicious circle.  After a nice conversation with Microsoft's ‚ÄúAgent‚Äù, I was told that in 3 weeks they would be engaged in this and the account would be closed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4c/e7a/01f/d4ce7a01f472dcf40856471a32dfcbb6.jpg" alt="Correspondence with the &quot;Agent&quot; Microsoft"><br><br>  8. iCloud - easy.  First you need to transfer all iWorks documents from iCloud to the BTSync folder.  After that, I turned off syncing with iCloud in the calendar, notes, contacts and just keep them on my Mac. <br><br>  9. LastPass - this password manager has been in use for about a year, and I like it.  However, to synchronize passwords between devices, it stores them in the cloud.  <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> is like a <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">reasonable</a> alternative, so I forked out 17 pounds in trifles and set it up.  Password transfer - through the usual export / import of CSV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/799/d48/b9f/799d48b9f19985e41b9026fa254f69d4.jpg" alt="Sad LastPass"><br><br>  10. Phone - everything is tricky here.  Let's start with my device.  This is the Nexus 4, so it is strongly tied to Google services.  Fortunately, since this is a Nexus, there are alternatives.  Chose Ubuntu Touch.  Now the OS is far from ready, but since I got the opportunity to make calls, receive / send SMS and use the browser, you can wait until the OS acquires capabilities.  Execution of instructions from the Ubuntu website was quite simple, because  The phone was already root.  I had a small heart attack when the phone went into an endless reboot, but the wipe and manual installation solved the problem and I now have a cool new toy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2a/075/84b/c2a07584b1510ad4a0bb1fdcc2be6d53.jpg" alt="UbuntuTouch @ Nexus 4"><br><br>  11. Google - my main (non-work) email address was on Gmail.  Also used G + for photos and for communication with people.  I decided that it would be wise to use Google Takeout to export all the data.  I do not have the fastest Internet, so it takes several hours to download 20Gb of data that was on Google servers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3f/023/abd/a3f023abda85539402b0cb49b8f1e2b9.png" alt="Google takeout"><br><br>  I have mail on the school domain, which will now be my only personal email address.  I didn‚Äôt tell anyone about the address change, I just made sure that the new address is being used by all my accounts.  If someone needs to contact me - they can call me (if my phone still works on Ubuntu).  I downloaded GPG for Mac Mail and installed it for extra security when I need it. <br><br>  There is still something to clean up.  Removed other accounts, such as Evernote and Wunderlist, decided to use SublimeText for this later. <br><br>  Something like this.  I am free.  My data is now mine.  There are a few things left to deal with.  I would like to have access to a secure social network - perhaps built on P2P technology with <abbr title="end-to-end encryption">inter-end encryption</abbr> , set it aside for the future.  For the time being, I continue to use Twitter, because it is already all public, with no complaints about privacy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190188/</a></p>
