For example, the service has a field to fill in a letter - an answer to a vacancy, but there is no elementary template for writing a letter - a title, briefly about yourself, answers to requirements for a vacancy. <br><br>  If not, you have to do it.  After all, a JS specialist will not be involved in Copy-Paste operations many times when he knows that they can be automated without even burdening the site service.  There are tools such as custom scripts. <br><br>  <b>UPD 12.1.2016</b> : The script is extended to career.ru sites (HH clone with the same client base), <a href="http://itmozg.ru/">itmozg.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.superjob.ru/">superjob.ru</a> .

      At first, of course, I had to copy it, until regularities came to light and the <a href="https://greasyfork.org/ru/scripts/10338-hhfiller">user <b>script hhFiller</b></a> did not work.  The response pattern, in my opinion, should contain: <br>  1. Headline greeting.  After it will go immediately handwritten text, a lively response to a vacancy of 2-3 or more lines. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  2. Briefly about yourself.  Probably, we can assume that the author of the vacancy will look at the page of the applicant and see everything.  But it is more polite to say about it immediately, without burdening the employer with the need to look into the link.  This text is, for the most part, the same for all letters, and it always has to be inserted (maybe for a vacancy on a different profile you will need different text or delete some lines from the template).  Here we also place a link to our examples of works and familiar technologies. <br>  3. Signature.  This is also a part of the politeness protocol that does not change for different letters. <br>  4. Responses to job requirements.  With this part it is more interesting, because it must be copied from the text of the vacancy and diluted with your answers.  Without answers - it is impossible, otherwise it will turn out dry and patterned, copy by Ctrl-C - yet, for a long time.  JS allows you to simply copy the selected text to which we want to respond, and then it is inserted into the template with a script. <br><br>  That's all that is needed to facilitate the job of compiling a response to a vacancy.  A similar technique can be applied to any other sites. <br><br><h3>  Technical side </h3><br>  To implement this, a custom script (user script) or browser extension works.  The extension is inconvenient because for each browser it is necessary to write it individually, and user scripts are more versatile: it runs in all major browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Opera (old and new), Safari and others.  By specifying the site hh.ru as the target site, we will ensure the launch of the script only on the indicated site, after the site loads its page.  Further, the script looks at the page, searches for the field where to enter the letter template, and if there is one (and if it is empty), enter it. <br><br>  Due to the characteristics of each site, the goal is not always achieved equally and simply.  For example, on hh.ru, the response field does not initially exist on the job page, you have to wait for it.  But these are optional technical details if the script is already there and working.  Once it was written - it remains to be corrected in case of a change in the page layout on the target site. <br><br>  There remains a question with the text of the template - it is for each applicant, his own, individual.  Where to write it?  The simplest thing is to write directly into the text of the script.  But then after installing the user script, you will have to look into the code, which is not very common for non-specialists in JS.  Let's expand the circle of users by first asking the script what the template should be (this is just a single block of text), and then store it in the browser memory (localStorage).  Then the applicant will not have to work with the script code.  In case of erasing the browser or the need to install a script on another computer, it is advisable to copy the template to your computer into a text file in order to use it later. <br><br><h3>  Now the way to work with vacancies is as follows: </h3><br>  1. Download <a href="https://greasyfork.org/ru/scripts/10338-hhfiller">user <b>hhFiller</b></a> . <br>  2. Open a vacancy (need authorization on <a href="http://hh.ru/">hh.ru</a> ). <br>  3. If the template has not yet been communicated to the script, it will ask how to fill in the answer field.  We fill the answer field with our (individual) letter template.  (Like that.) <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/019/83c/60f/01983c60fc004194b9e4732d120ba303.png"></div><br>  4. (Optional.) So that at the end of the letter your answers to the vacancy requirements appear, select the text of the requirements on the page. <br>  5. Press the button "Respond to the vacancy."  Now a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù will occur: the selected text is not simply copied to the end of the letter template, but at the end of each sentence the answers ‚Äúyes‚Äù appeared. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/268/105/605/2681056051d94580a85984a3aacd31ee.png"></div><br>  Because most often you answer so.  But then, of course, it is necessary to clarify these short answers as a matter of fact of each requirement, and some - delete or replace with ‚Äúno‚Äù. <br>  6. We finish the letter template to the full answer to the vacancy.  Best of all - if there is something to say at the very beginning about yourself, so that it looks advantageous against the background of other responses. <br>  7. We send the made response. <br><br><h3>  Some tips </h3><br>  * <b>How to supplement the response</b> if it has not yet been sent?  On the website hh.ru there is a feature that the response is made out in a pop-up, while the text of the vacancy is partially visible.  You can return to the text of the job by clicking outside the popup.  In this case, the typed text does not disappear.  The response text can be opened once again (with the same button ‚ÄúRespond to the vacancy‚Äù) and added. <br><br>  * <b>How to return to the original template</b> with the requirements (a copy of the selected text)?  It is enough to select the entire response text and delete it.  An empty field is immediately (script) filled with the template text and the selected text below it. <br><br>  * <b>If you do not want to use the</b> template, but do not disable the script for this job?  Similarly, we delete the text, but not with the Delete button, but by entering a character so that the field immediately becomes non-empty. <br><br>  * <b>How to copy to the response</b> more than one selection?  In the old way - via Ctrl-C.  At the same time, the way of copying through selection (Selection) of requirements for a vacancy provided by the script is not canceled.  True, it will work either for the first time (when the response is first opened), or after clearing the input field, as described above.  So it is provided that there was no repeated automatic input of the selected text. <br><br>  * Need <b>to change or edit the template</b> ?  In the browser console, being on the site hh.ru, the expression ‚ÄúlocalStorage.tmpl‚Äù can display and read the template text (this is one line).  Expression localStorage.tmpl = "" - delete the template.  After that, reloading the page, we have the opportunity to enter a new template text. <br><br>  * The template can be <b>entered into the script</b> .  Instead of the line "Uv.  job seeker  Please ... ‚Äùwrite down your template (note, it will be erased when updating the script from the Internet, so save it separately).  To make it easier to read, use "\ n".  For example, here is the "template template" for the script: <br><br><pre><code class="html hljs xml">',  !\r\n\' +'\r\n\' +',  ,        ,        .\r\n\' +'\r\n\' +'  : HTML, CSS, JS, plain text, Photoshop, PHP, Perl, Apache.\r\n\' +'\r\n\' +'    : http://yandex.ru/search/?text=%20%20html .\r\n\'' +'\r\n\' +'--  ,\r\n\' +' ,\r\n\' +'email: <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">CENSORED</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag"> </span><span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-attr">-</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">     &gt;</span></span>'</code> </pre> <br><br>  If the template is entered into the textarea input field during execution in the "Message from hhfiller.user.js ..." window, the "\ n" characters, on the contrary, will be unnecessary. <br><br>  Everything, the script helped us not to perform routine work, and employers had the opportunity to experience your ability to work with information. <br><br>  * <b>To run in Chrome,</b> you need to place the manifest.json file next to it and install it as an unpacked extension (in developer mode, by checking the checkbox on chrome: // extensions /). <br><br>  File manifest.json: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">manifest.json</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="xml hljs">{ "content_scripts": [ { "exclude_globs": [ ], "exclude_matches": [ ], "include_globs": [ "http://hh.ru/*", "http://career.ru/*", "https://moikrug.ru/*", "http://itmozg.ru/*" ], "js": [ "hhfiller.user.js" ], "matches": [ "http://*/*", "https://*/*" ], "run_at": "document_idle" } ], "converted_from_user_script": true, "description": "     hh.ru|career|moikrug|itmozg||superjob   ", "name": "hhFiller", "version": "8.2016.1.12", "manifest_version": 2 }</code> </pre></div></div><br><h3>  The feature of the engine hh.ru </h3><br>  The web engine of this site has one unpleasant and uncontrollable feature by the applicant, which he himself cannot see without having an employer account.  And there is this bug for at least more than 2 years.  About him is very rare, but employers mention the words "you have everything merged into one line."  And this is with the manual filling of the response, without any scripts.  The competitor does not see the bug - under the link ‚ÄúView Response‚Äù he observes a decent formatted text, correctly divided into paragraphs. <br><br>  And somewhere in the depths of the pages of the employer when viewing the same response, he sees the text, put together in one line!  (Once, about 2 years ago, someone even sent me a screenshot of what happens. And now, according to reviews, the bug has survived.) Therefore, until it is corrected, it makes no sense to form long lists of your achievements - all of them, imagine that they will be read put together in one line.  As a result, the applicant will win, who writes relatively briefly, and not vice versa. <br><br>  I think everyone will be grateful if the management of the site and the company corrects, finally, this bug. <br><br>  Improvements to the script for use on other sites are welcome. <br><br><h3>  Supplement: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/259787/"><b>moikrug.ru</b></a> </h3><br>  While writing text and debugging the script before publication, a <b>new moikrug.ru</b> appeared in the design of the TM team. <br><br>  Well, this format, of course, is still very unstable, but there is a good opportunity to try and apply the same technique with a pattern and responses on another site. <br><br>  From the peculiarities, it turned out that here the field for response is already open on the vacancy page, so to insert the selected text ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù we stop (to confirm) with the question: do we need to change the answers to the requirements for the vacancy? <br><div style="text-align:center;"> <nobr><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/089/5da/b29/0895dab29a2c4f9981d0af5ed257b529.png"></nobr> </div><br>  If the selection was for other purposes, we say "No" (cancel the action).  In general, the interface on this site is more user-friendly, since  further shows in what form the letter and related data are submitted to the employer, the process of reading the letter by the recipient does not look like a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Feedback </h3><br>  Question to readers.  I would like to know which works services involved the use of a letter template through the site, without the need for such scripts? <br><br>  Another question: on which sites I would like to have a similar script and template? <br><br>  Do you need such a script at all?  Or on the site, the interface should be so perfect that the need for a script does not arise?  In general, as done on ... where? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259881/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259881/</a></p>
