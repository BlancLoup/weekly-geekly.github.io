Among all this diversity there are those devices, without which an ordinary person can no longer imagine his existence.  This, for example, a smartphone or headphones.  For many, this is entertainment, a tool for work and much more.  And there are gadgets purely for geeks, among which there are devices, without which it is possible to do without, but which attract the attention of a person to whom modern technologies are close and understandable. <br><br>  Among such systems are ‚Äúlevitating‚Äù devices.  We are talking about a whole category of devices that, thanks to magnetic induction, can float in the air without any visible support.  And there are a lot of such gadgets.  Maybe you already have something like that?  In any case, let's see what the market now offers in this direction. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  MAG-LEV Audio </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/se0XO3780Pg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  This device can be called a system for the geeks squared.  Not only is MAG-LEV Audio itself a vinyl record player, the device also consists of two parts, one of which is floating in the air.  Namely, the ‚Äúspinner‚Äù itself flies (while being quite reliably tied to one place), on which the record is put. 
      <br>

      When the player is turned off, it is held on four supports.  But if the user decides to listen to the music, the supports smoothly go into the body, and the record starts to float in the air.  To make your device even more futuristic, the developers added an unusual design and lighting. <br><br>  If you already thought about a power outage, then in this case there is an emergency battery.  Energy is stored in it just enough to have enough to raise the pickup and slowly lowering the "turntable" with the plate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d9/956/69f/2d995669f19e9073e454bf497e57c0cd.jpg"><br><br>  It uses Pro-Ject 8.6 tonearm and Ortofon OM 5E pickup head (very high quality, it should be noted).  The system supports two playback modes - 33 and 45 revolutions per minute. <br><br>  The creators of the player tried to do everything to ensure that the sound was of high quality, so the device should appeal to both vintage audiophiles and geeks who like futuristic devices.  The funds for the creation of this player, its developers have collected on Kickstarter.  Instead of the originally requested $ 300,000, the project team received more than $ 400,000.  This is despite the relatively high price of the player. <br><br>  Pre-order MAG-LEV Audio can be done in the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/mag-lev-audio/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating_gadgets_podborka%26utm_term%3Dmag-lev-audio">store Madrobots</a> . <br><h3>  Levitating "Death Star" </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/585/b0b/a84/585b0ba8408bf83ca726641e27449b88.jpg"><br><br>  The developers of the device received an official license for the production of thematic gadgets from the owner of the copyright in Star Wars.  And the very first device of this company was the "Death Star".  No, not a real destroyer of planets and civilizations, but a levitating wireless speaker, whose dimensions, however, are not so small: 143 * 143 * 30 mm. <br><br>  The speaker is equipped with a Bluetooth 4.1 wireless communication module.  The range of the device is 10 meters.  The speaker during operation does not just hover over the stand, it also rotates.  Unfortunately, the device is not equipped with wireless charging, so the device‚Äôs batteries must be recharged every 5 hours of operation. <br><br>  Charging is done with the help of the same Star of Death base. <br><br>  Developers estimate their device at $ 182.  It is available now and is sold both in regular stores and online. <br><br><h3>  Lyrix Axis Wireless Speaker </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33e/60e/a53/33e60ea539b37ea66ed1aa879b4179d0.jpg"><br><br>  Three times cheaper than the notorious destroyer of planets and civilizations is another wireless speaker, Lyrix Axis.  Its great advantage is the ability to wirelessly charge, so there is no need to interrupt the playback of music to recharge the battery.  The device charges directly while working from its magnetic base. <br><br>  The device looks good, especially in the dark: the developers have equipped their system with lighting.  The base can also be used for charging wired devices, for this it has a USB port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e9/22d/ac7/0e922dac7a000c6664db68c3325ac0fb.jpg"><br><br>  The system is capable of reproducing sounds with a frequency from 40 Hz to 20 kHz.  Distortion - only 0.5%, which is quite decent for a portable system.  The range of the Bluetooth speaker is 10 meters from the signal source. <br><br><h3>  ASWY Air Speaker WA-102 </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtAGezNOqL0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And another wireless speaker, which also deserves mention.  This is a portable wireless device compatible with Bluetooth 4.0 protocol.  The range of the speaker - 10 meters.  Output power 5 watts.  ASWY Air Speaker WA-102 also charges through the air, so there is no need to think about recharging the batteries, everything happens in automatic mode. <br><br>  If there is such a need, it is possible to work with ASWY Air Speaker WA-102 without a stand using the speaker as a mobile speaker.  At the base of the device there is a magnet that can be fixed on any magnetic surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/883/0d3/f23/8830d3f23babad357928c09fda7a3f59.jpg"><br><br>  Now a wireless levitating speaker can be purchased on pre-order <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/aswy-air-speaker-wa-102-v2/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating_gadgets_podborka%26utm_term%3Daswy-air-speaker">in our store</a> . <br><br><h3>  Levitron globe floating in the air </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/93f/c58/16f/93fc5816fb33b43276fad08b58f56bd3.jpg"><br><br>  This device has been released for a long time, but remains popular.  The globe floating in the air can be used both as a decoration and as a tool for studying geography for children - this system attracts attention immediately.  And adults can plan a guided tour using Levitron AG. <br><br>  Like previous devices, magnetic induction works here, which allows the globe to stay in the air. <br><br>  Levitron AG has several analogues, so there are plenty to choose from.  The cost of such devices starts at $ 30-40. <br><br><h3>  LePlant Levitating Plant Pot </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7pNDt9ew0No" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  What just do not come up with people.  Levitating systems are also created for lovers of home flowers and plants.  LePlant Levitating Plant Pot provides comfortable conditions for plants of any type that can be grown at home.  The diameter of the pot is 90 mm. <br><br>  The pot stand is trimmed with wood, its dimensions are 150 * 150 mm.  The magnetic base of the pot interacts with the electromagnetic part of the stand, the pot hovers over the supply at a short distance and rotates smoothly. <br><br>  LePlant pots are available in various modifications for different plants, including bonsai trees. <br><br>  Now <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/leplant/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating_gadgets_podborka%26utm_term%3Dleplant">we can arrange</a> for a pre-order pot. <br><br><h3>  Universal Levitating Platform </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1gMMM62NC-4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Crealev company produces not specific devices - speakers or globes, but a platform that can hold in the air any objects weighing up to 9 kilograms.  It can be anything from a pillow to a chessboard. <br><br>  The same company is engaged in the creation of flying displays for computers, it also produces levitating light bulbs.  Crealev has a rather large set of flying devices, so there is something to choose - for the home and for the office, there is something for everyone. <br><br>  Why not hang in the air a stack of favorite books, so as not to forget to read them from time to time? <br><br>  In general, the set of levitating devices on the market is very large, everything is here - from toys to hi-tech devices.  Despite the fact that the principle of magnetic induction is known for a very long time, gadgets of this type attract attention right away.  This is a great decoration for your desktop, flying system will be happy and an adult and a child. <br><br>  In general, we work with a large number of levitating gadgets, not all are listed in the selection.  Here is an example of what we have yet: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rL4eeLwDOzA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Soon we will publish the second campaign, manufacturers are now producing a lot of impressive devices. <br><hr><br>  We remind you that for all our readers there is a promotional code GEEK, giving a 5 percent discount on any product from <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dlevitating_gadgets_podborka%26utm_term%3Dmain_page">the Madrobots store</a> .
