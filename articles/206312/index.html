  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top 10 books to understand the stock market device</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The modern stock market is a large-scale and rather complicated area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge.  For beginners, it is not easy to understand all the intricacies of relationships that arise between people when they are on the stock exchange and learn the basics of online trading.  At the same time, many investors, who are already active, do not have a sufficient set of basic knowledge.  In our today's topic there is a list of books that will help you to grasp the basic concepts of the stock market (and indeed the financial field) to beginners and allow more experienced traders to broaden their horizons and deepen their knowledge. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Trading Philosophy </h4><br>  <b>Fooled by randomness.</b>  <b>The hidden role of chance in the markets and in life - Nassim Talleb</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b7/738/ad3/5b7738ad34f0105ea069fb5e0c8cf954.jpg" alt="image">

      The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/5566717/">book is</a> very unexpected for the absolute majority of people - if a person is lucky in life, then it is quite likely that he is not such a genius who developed a successful strategy, but a simple lucky one.  On the stock exchange, everything is the same as in life - there are trading strategies using which someone breaks a bank, but no one knows about the multitude of investors who, following them, did not succeed.  The book is very useful for the formation of the correct attitude to life and the stock market, in particular. <br><br>  <b>Memories of a stock speculator - Edwin Lefebvre</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9e/da6/816/b9eda6816ee374ec2c7e3176afd889b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A classic <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/2142763/">work</a> that will be useful to read even to those who are not interested in the stock market.  The story of the protagonist, the prototype of which was made by the real merchant Jessie Livermore, fully reflects the life of anyone who decided to link their fate with the exchange trade - ups, followed by falls, which are extremely difficult to survive.  The book was first published in 1923 and still accurately reflects the nature of the market, describes the thinking patterns of stock traders and describes their typical mistakes. <br><br>  <b>Quanta. How wizards from mathematics earned billions and nearly collapsed the stock market - Scott Patterson</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63e/555/fdc/63e555fdc96eb937df3028c1c32ad88b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/22685935/">The book is</a> about those who became the cause of the crisis of 2007, and now derives from it the world economy, earning billions from this.  The book has become a bestseller and, although it is more related to the genre of journalism than the actual exchange literature, it is necessary to read it in order to understand what serious opponents you will have to deal with as soon as you find yourself on the market. <br><br>  <b>Stock Trading.</b>  <b>The classic formula for timing, money and emotion management - Jesse Livermore</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cc/3f9/7a5/6cc3f97a50c0df47af66df5924cbae08.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The logical continuation of the book Lefebvre.  A very useful <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4182841/">book</a> - it contains, as the name implies, the ‚ÄúLivermore formula‚Äù with an example of its use in the case of stock trading.  Of course, in today's market, in which robots and high-frequency traders play an increasing role, you can hardly use it, but it will be extremely useful for understanding the structure of the market. <br><br>  <b>Investor dancer.</b>  <b>How I earned $ 2,000,000 in the stock market - Nicholas Darvas</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/898/41a/76e/89841a76e11369fe5c0d51089abbb5d9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nicholas Darvas is considered one of the best traders of the second half of the twentieth century.  The personality is very interesting - a professional dancer who managed to develop a method of choosing stocks, which was ideally suited to beginners, because he did not require special knowledge from them.  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/6210282/">The book was</a> first published in 1961, reprinted many times and from it you can still learn a lot of valuable knowledge. <br><br><h4>  Theory and Practice of Trading </h4><br>  <b>Secrets of stock trading - Vladimir Tvardovsky, Sergey Parshikov</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b4/67f/3a4/1b467f3a42afdabe20b42c0dfb1df206.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A very good <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/7347188/">book</a> about working in the Russian stock market.  The authors, one of which is the chairman of the board of <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/education/articles/literature/">ITinvest</a> Vladimir Tvardovsky, have created a real e-commerce textbook, which contains not only theory, but also illuminates many practical issues. <br><br>  <b>New market mages.</b>  <b>Conversations with America's Best Traders - Jack D. Schwager</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad2/b2f/a0f/ad2b2fa0f8072ddcc44b7f482a7ea64e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Conversations with leading portfolio managers and traders who have achieved outstanding success in trading on the stock exchange.  In the <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/1720835/">book,</a> they talk about their trading methods, investment ideas and receptions - information that will be extremely useful for beginners and experienced investors. <br><br>  <b>How to predict the collapse of financial markets.</b>  <b>Critical Events in Complicated Financial Systems - Didier Sornette</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b38/94d/10c/b3894d10c82467fbdd18243f68ed080b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3657954/">book</a> is that if, with the help of new scientific concepts, to understand the financial failures that have happened in the past, then it will be quite possible to predict them in the future.  The author set as his goal the creation of a scientific method for predicting both market failures and its individual elements such as currencies or stocks. <br><br>  <b>Long-term secrets of short-term trading - Larry Williams</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/016/d70/a24/016d70a244488fd7a6f9eaf6c3920999.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The author is a recognized master in short-term speculation - once at a competition during the year he turned $ 10k into $ 1.1 million. In his <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4374279/">book,</a> he describes his methods that lead to the best results, and also provides the basis for short-term trading.  The whole trading system is not presented in the book, however, from the point of view of the psychology of trading, it is an unsurpassed thing. <br><br>  <b>Chaos and order in the markets of the Capital.</b>  <b>New analytical look at cycles, prices and market volatility - Edgar Peters</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/117/972/4c3/1179724c3d6416b05b36548a0c76a2a4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/947092/">The book</a> is devoted to modern problems of nonlinear economic dynamics (economic synergy), it describes in detail and analyzes the processes occurring in the market under the influence of various factors.  A clear structure of presentation: a large amount of introductory material, coupled with a large amount of information directly on the topic, will make it useful and interesting for both beginners and experienced investors. <br><br>  PS If you think that some great book unfairly did not get into our list - share a link in the comments, we will do another topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206312/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206312/</a></p>
