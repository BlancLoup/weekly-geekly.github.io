Recently, my husband had a birthday, I wanted to make some unusual cake, I could not find ideas for making a penguin cake on the Internet, I had to dream a little.  Soon the day of the system administrator, perhaps this idea is useful to you.  The cake is easy to prepare, the main thing is to have patience and buy a good mixer for my wife (mother, girlfriend) :). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I make the cake three-layered, so first you need to cook 3 biscuit cakes.  You can make a double-layer cake, then you need 2 cakes. <br><br>  <b>Ingredients for sponge cake:</b> <br>  4 eggs <br>  a pinch of salt <br>  1 cup of sugar <br>  1 cup flour <br>  1.5 tsp baking powder <br><br>  <b>Cooking technology</b> (I know that there are other ways of cooking, but I do this. If you have a recipe for biscuit dough, which you can do, prepare it): <br>  Beat eggs with salt.  Add a glass of sugar, beat until the mixture is homogeneous.  Add flour mixed with baking powder.  Mix everything with a mixer.  In one of the cakes, you can add cocoa.  Cover the bottom of the form (I have 26 cm, detachable) with baking paper, sprinkle the sides with flour.  Put the dough.

      <br>
      Bake at 180 degrees for 35-40 minutes.  Willingness to check with a toothpick or a match, pierce the dough with it, if it is dry, then the dough is ready. <br>  Cool the cakes on a lattice or a wooden board covered with a towel, in any case not to stack each other. <br>  I usually make cakes in one day, and collect the cake on another.  So that the cakes do not dry out during the night, I cover them with towels.  If the top of the cake or the sides are hardened, carefully cut off the hardened pieces. <br>  Each cake should be cut horizontally into 2 cakes, I cut with a long knife. <br><br>  Next, you need to cook the cream, I do the brew, you can cook another. <br>  <b>Ingredients for cream:</b> <br>  4 cups milk <br>  2 cups sugar <br>  4 eggs <br>  6 tablespoons flour <br><br>  <b>Cooking technology:</b> <br>  1) 2 cups of milk, eggs and flour to move with a whisk.  It should remain as little as possible lumps, the remaining will disperse with further heating. <br>  2) Combine 2 cups of milk with sugar in a saucepan, bring to a slow boil. <br>  3) In the boiling mixture (2) pour the mixture (1), bring to a boil, stirring constantly. <br>  Turn off and do not stop stirring for 5 minutes.  The cream is ready, it must be cooled.  In the cream, you can add vanilla, cocoa, citric acid. <br><br>  <b>Putting the cake:</b> <br>  You will need a 30x40 cm tray / dish to fit the penguin stencil. <br>  So, if you had 3 shortcakes and you cut each of them in half, you got 6 shortcakes.  3 of them must be cut in accordance with the stencil.  It is a little crooked, as drawn by hand, you need to align when cutting) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f11/7fe/e9c/f117fee9ce923ca2ceebd0fa6ce155ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I printed the stencil on the printer, then transferred it onto cardboard and cut out the templates.  The body of the penguin is a cake, it remains to add the legs and head. <br><br>  We spread on the tray the penguin's head, torso (whole cake) and legs.  Next, soak the cakes with juice, about 2 teaspoons per 1 cake.  Lubricate the cake with cream, especially the seams between the parts of the penguin.  We spread a layer of fruit of your choice on top of the cream: currants, raspberries, cherries (cut in half and remove the bones), strawberries, bananas, kiwi ... Since I got sweet cream, I put currants and raspberries. <br>  From above we lay out one more exactly the same layer: cake, impregnation, cream, fruit. <br>  Next, another layer of the layer, on top of the cake lay out a little cream, just to keep the fruit.  Next comes the hard work of decorating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e93/eed/e05/e93eede05543263d3bb3cd20b99f48aa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The black part is black currant, the white part is white currant =).  I enlarged the image of the penguin to the size of the cake, printed and cut out the patterns: eye, beak, white body and paws. <br>  I made the beak and legs of marzipan (bought from the store), so I laid them out last. <br><br>  Fruits are poured over a jelly bag cake.  Cool the jelly until it freezes on a spoon taken out of it for 5 seconds. <br>  Fill the pieces on which the fruit laid out, jelly.  Put the marzipan on top. <br>  Next, I prepare the cream from the package, and decorate them with the sides of the cake.  It is advisable to leave the cake in the fridge overnight so that it becomes saturated and tastier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb1/18c/3e6/bb118c3e61f700e3284b7ed1198c2da7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main thing in the cake form, cakes, cream, you can use any.  Enjoy your meal! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63650/</a></p>
