It began with an accident: the company's founders Alexander Borovsky and Stanislav Buyanov were engaged in the development of corporate web systems, and did not have a relationship with smart houses, when one of his friends complained about the problems with the ‚Äúsmart house‚Äù of his boss. <br><br>  As it turned out, the previous integrator did its work rather mediocre: the reliability of automation left much to be desired, problems constantly arose, which were corrected for a very long time.  And the system itself, installed just three years before, was already essentially outdated.  The size of the object is impressive: 14 rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 250 meters and the attached seven rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 150 meters.  From the point of view of the integrator, this is no longer an apartment, but a whole polygon.

      The customer wanted to maximally modernize and increase the reliability of the existing smart home control system, and to automate new attached premises.  This is where iRidium comes into being.  Based on iRidium software and iPads as control panels, Borovsky and Buyanov created their own automation system, which is in no way connected with the existing one, and developed a smart home control interface, which became BeeToo Home. <br><br>  Now in this apartment BeeToo controls the light in all rooms, curtains, multimedia, microclimate and remote opening of the front door: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGfXLSiJUVE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhinunpRaIoIx5L0etW1bNnShWsXoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the plans - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">selector communication</a> between rooms, control of a landline phone and increased security - for example, connecting emergency control sensors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ad/c2d/558/9adc2d558861489c9c953e951953e6ca.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">6 more screenshots of the interface</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab6/7dd/8c5/ab67dd8c56ba4cba84f72bfcb82106f6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/312/94a/364/31294a3645e94399825322f8136fe73a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/198/9ed/5fa/1989ed5fafbc40209139816ce88a7382.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e1/879/6be/6e18796be0d7421992e732dcee33d8c7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90a/e63/b72/90ae63b7249e4e5b8ebe72b5b4f58f4c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/138/2e2/c09/1382e2c09c0044568ad990f50e12f656.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  <a href="http://www.iridiummobile.ru/projects/beetoo-home/">Full description of the project on the iRidium website</a> . <br><br>  The iRidium competition turned out to be a good opportunity to declare oneself as a company using non-standard methods of work.  Especially for participation in it in BeeToo they were confused by the creation of a beautiful video representing their system in action (the above video is an expanded version of that winning video).  The submitted works were evaluated by the iRidium mobile team for the uniqueness and beauty of the interface design, as well as the complexity and uniqueness of the project.  BeeToo was the best in both categories. <br><br>  The competition <a href="http://www.iridiummobile.ru/blog/itogi-konkursa-proektov-iridium-awards/">was quite strong</a> : from December 17, 2013 to February 28, 2014, 18 applications were received from 10 countries of the world - Russia, Belarus, Brazil, Vietnam, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France and Saudi Arabia.  Many users and companies in the automation market followed this competition, and after the victory BeeToo became interested in buying their interface - for a startup it was a real breakthrough.  The guys appreciated the importance of high-quality promo their work. <br><br>  Now BeeToo has more than ten employees, new customers have emerged, and a sharp dislike for the phrase ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù has emerged, which, in their opinion, has discredited itself: on the one hand, it is associated with something prohibitively expensive, on the other - many users already Obed on the poor quality work of integrators, who were often interested more in selling expensive equipment than its proper operation.  As a result, if in the West smart homes are developed primarily for the sake of saving and more efficient use of resources, then we have them more suitable for boasting to friends than for everyday use.  Therefore, in BeeToo for ‚Äúhome automation‚Äù - as a term without a heavy background of past experiences in creating smart homes. <br><br>  This year, they <a href="http://www.iridiummobile.ru/blog/vyigrayte-iphone-6-i-stante-uznavaemymi-c-iridium/">will</a> again <a href="http://www.iridiummobile.ru/blog/vyigrayte-iphone-6-i-stante-uznavaemymi-c-iridium/">take part in the competition</a> , promising to present the BeeToo Cinema project - a home theater automation project that is suitable for simple TVs and full-size systems.  We are waiting for videos. <br><br>  Advice from BeeToo to those wishing to participate in the iRidium competition: the description of automation projects is rarely exciting, so it is important to compensate for their boring nature by creating videos of the ‚ÄúKickstarter‚Äù level.  Do as for yourself - and everything will turn out. <br><br>  This year, accepting applications at the request of participants is extended from February 28 to March 5.  Follow the announcements <a href="http://www.iridiummobile.ru/blog/">on the iRidium blog</a> , where the results of the competition will be announced in March - and, of course, in the iRidium mobile blog on Giktimes. <br><br> <a href="http://www.iridiummobile.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b25/670/de3/b25670de3b05466c8c118471205ca3fb.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153851/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153851/</a></p>
