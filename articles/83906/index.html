  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Become a successful programmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>1. Do not stop learning</b> <br><br>  I assume that you would not even read this post, if you did not have at least an elementary education, and you would not even want to know how to become a successful programmer without a higher education.  If you are a programmer now, why stop studying? <br>  It is simply forbidden.  One important thing here: <b>Standing in one place does not mean that you are standing still - this means you are moving backwards.</b>  Just moving forward does not mean that you are moving forward - it only means that you are not lost with losers somewhere in the end.  To move forward, you should learn all the time ‚Äî not just moving, but RUN. <br>  Here is my short list that falls under this item: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Read books <br>  ‚Ä¢ Subscribe to RSS and read various articles <br>  ‚Ä¢ Try different programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand things you've heard <br>  ‚Ä¢ Go to seminars and prepare your own presentations. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Learn anything that can help you move. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Teach others as it teaches you. <br><br>  <b>2. Determine your goal and follow the correct path.</b>

      I think it‚Äôs hard to run if you don‚Äôt know where to run.  The main task is to clearly represent your goal.  Your goal should be long-term and big.  And after you already have a vision of your goal, take it and break it into small tasks - that is, build your card to success.  You should make a list of tasks that you MUST complete in a month or a year.  Once you have it, just follow it clearly. <br><br>  <b>3. Any problems are possibilities.</b> <br><br>  In everyday work, you always encounter different Trouble.  You get new tasks or bug reports from testers.  You get new projects from Project Managers.  Your employee asks for help.  You need help.  These are all examples of problems.  And the really important question here is: how do you meet them?  You can say, ‚ÄúOh, but I‚Äôm not getting rid of bad, annoying work.‚Äù  You are absolutely wrong here.  <b>Remember that your bosses will be happy to give you more difficult work as soon as they see that you are coping with current tasks.</b> <br><br>  <b>4. Be positive</b> <br><br>  You have to look at everything positively.  If you find that you made a mistake just accept it easily - everyone makes mistakes.  <b>Do you like people who whine when they have problems?</b>  How do you think you will look in the eyes of others, if you say: ‚ÄúYes, guys, I did it - I will decide it, give me a minute‚Äù and later you come back and start fixing your mistake with a smile on your face.  As soon as you solve the problem you will be just happy. <br>  Your road is good and you move forward quickly.  Never, never think that you will not reach your goal - this is the essence of this item. <br><br>  <b>5. Find a mentor</b> <br><br>  This does not mean that you need a person who will help you to do your work - because it‚Äôs just a teacher or a more experienced developer.  This means that <b>you need a person who is where you want to be.</b>  You need to take an example from this person.  If this person is not high enough - just find someone more serious.  Also have friends who will help you move along the way.  Or just use the support of a woman or girl. <br><br>  <b>6. Become famous</b> <br><br>  <b>If you do not show others that you are cool and that you deserve more, how will they know about it?</b>  There is a simple solution - start blogging, ask and answer questions, make sure Google knows you.  Spread your knowledge in your team and on the project.  If you learned something new, why not share it?  You will forget these new things if you do not try them. <br><br>  <b>7. Follow your tasks, be sure that you are still on your way.</b> <br><br>  From time to time you should check you are doing everything right.  Make sure you complete the tasks.  If not, quickly find the causes and work on them.  <b>Find your weaknesses and fight them.</b>  This may sound ridiculous, but I know a good programmer with good theoretical knowledge, but his code rate is just awful.  Why?  Because he has just a terrible keyboard and he does not want to spend 10-20 hours behind the simulator.  Isn't that stupid?  Friend, if you read this article, promise that you will overcome this slack. <br><br>  <b>8. Do gymnastics</b> <br><br>  I did a little self-survey when I wrote this article.  And "Do gymnastics" hit the list.  I am young enough and spend a lot of time at the laptop and at the other machine at work and I cannot bring myself to do gymnastics.  But it‚Äôs like turning blades.  There is such a story about two woodcutters who argued about who will cut down more trees.  One woodcutter was healthy and big, and the other was thin, like me.  Strong was sure that he would win, because he had cut down trees for 8 hours without a break, and thin, he took a break for 15 minutes.  every hour.  But the fight won the thin - he cut down 150 trees at the time when the Strongman cut down 100. The secret was that he sharpened the blade when he rested.  <b>Your health is your ax and if it is stupid you will not be able to cut down the road to success.</b> <br><br>  <b>So let all your axes be sharpened!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83906/</a></p>
