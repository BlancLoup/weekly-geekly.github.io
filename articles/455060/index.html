  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Homer or the first ever opensource. part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It seems that Homer with his poems is something distant, archaic, difficult to read and naive.  But it is not.  We are all imbued with Homer, the ancient Greek culture from which all of Europe came out: our language is replete with words and quotations from ancient Greek literature: take at least such expressions as ‚ÄúHomeric laughter‚Äù, ‚ÄúBattle of the gods‚Äù, ‚ÄúAchilles heel‚Äù, ‚ÄúApple of discord‚Äù and our native: "Trojan horse".  It's all somehow from Homer.  And about the influence of the Hellenistic culture, the language of the Hellenes (the Greeks did not know the word "Greece" and did not call themselves so, this ethnonym came to us from the Romans) and there is no need to speak.  School, academy, gymnasium, philosophy, physics (metaphysics) and mathematics, technology ... choir, stage, guitar, media theater - you can‚Äôt name it all - these are ancient Greek words.  And you did not know? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02b/271/8c8/02b2718c8d71da642305b1b6d7f7bd90.jpg" alt="image"><br>  ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And it is also argued that the Greeks were the first to invent money in the form of chased coins ... Alphabet, as we know it.  The first money was minted from a natural alloy of silver and gold, which they called electr (hello to electronic money from the past).  The alphabet with vowels and so on.  the transmission of all sounds of the word when writing is undoubtedly a Greek invention, although many consider the ancestors of the enterprising Phoenicians (Simit people living in the territory of modern Syria and Israel), who did not have vowels.  Interestingly, the Latin alphabet came out directly from the Greek, like the Slavic.  But the later alphabets of Western European countries are already derived from Latin.  In this sense, our Cyrillic alphabet is in the same place as the Latin one ... And how many are Greek in science, literature?  Iamb, trochee, muse, lira, poems, stanza, Pegasus with Parnassus.  The word "poet", "poetry", finally - they are all obvious now from where.  Do not list all!  But the title of my text gives the pathos (ancient Greek word) of my "discovery".  And so, I will hold my horses and go to Namely, I argue that the first opensource (so be it, add) with git'om appeared far in the past: in ancient Greece (more precisely in archaic ancient Greece) and the brightest representative This event is the well-known great Homer. <br><br>  Well, the introduction is made, now about everything in order.  Disclaimer: I will give the original meanings of the above Greek words at the end of the text (they are unexpected in some places) - this is for those who read this text to the end.  So let's go! <br><br>  Homer. <br>  The poems of the great Homer are usually dated to the end of the 9th beginning of the 8th century BC, although these texts apparently began to appear immediately after the events described in them, that is, somewhere in the 13th century BC.  In other words, they are about 3 thousand years old.  Directly Homer attributed "Iliad" and "Odyssey", "Homer's hymns" and a number of other works, such as the poem "Margit" and "Batrachomyohia" (satirical parody of the Iliad, which literally translates as "War of mice and frogs" (Machia - fight, strike, miss - mouse. According to scientists, only the first two works belong to Homer, the others, like many others, are attributed to him (why I‚Äôll tell below), according to others, Homer belongs only to the Iliad ... in general , the controversy continues, but one thing is certain - Homer was definitely and accurately  the events described by him near the walls of Troy (the second name of the city of Ilion, hence the Iliad)

      How do we know this?  At the end of the 19th century, Heinrich Schliemann, a German who made a huge fortune in Russia, realized his old childhood dream: he found and excavated Troy on the territory of modern Turkey, literally turning over all previous ideas about those times and texts on this topic.  Previously, it was believed that the Trojan events that began with the escape of the beautiful Helen with the Trojan prince Paris (Alexander) to Troy are all myths, because even for the ancient Greeks, described in the poems of the event were considered to be very antiquated.  However, not only the walls of Troy were excavated and found the most ancient gold ornaments of that time (they are in open access to the Tretyakov Gallery), later clay tablets of the most ancient Hittite state neighboring Troy were discovered, in which famous names were found: Agamemnon, Menelaus, Alexander ... So literary characters became historical, as these tablets reflected the diplomatic and tax realities of the once powerful Hittite state.  What is interesting, neither in Troas itself, nor in Hellas (funny, but this word did not exist in those days too) there was no writing at that time.  That is what gave impetus to the development of our theme, oddly enough. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/974/fc8/e88/974fc8e88957cb6e20a96e9bd41166ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, Homer.  Homer was an aed - that is, an itinerant singer of his songs (aed - singer).  Where he was born and how he died is not known for certain.  This is also because no less than seven cities on both sides of the Aegean Sea fought for the right to be called the homeland of Homer, as well as the place of his death in ancient times: Smyrna, Chios, Pylos, Samos, Athens and others.  Homer is not really a proper name, but a nickname.  It means from the most ancient something like a ‚Äúhostage‚Äù.  Presumably, the name given to him at birth was this: Melesigene, which means born Melesius, but this is not accurate.  In ancient times, Homer was often called so: Poet (Poetes).  It is with a capital letter, which was denoted by the corresponding article.  And everyone understood who we were talking about.  Poets - means ‚Äúcreator‚Äù - another ancient Greek word in our piggy bank. <br><br>  It is considered that Homer (Omir after Old Russian) was blind and old, but there is no evidence of this.  Homer himself did not describe himself in any way in his songs, nor was he described by conditional contemporaries (the poet Hesiod, for example).  In many ways, this presentation is based on the description of the Ades in his Odyssey: old, blind, gray-haired old men in their declining years, as well as on the widespread care of blind people of that time to wandering singers, since the blind man could hardly work, and at that time not invented. <br><br>  As already mentioned, the Greeks did not have writing at that time, and if we assume that most of the Ades were blind or weak-sighted (they had not thought up any points yet), then it would have been to them, therefore, the AED sang their songs solely from memory . <br><br>  It looked like this.  The wandering old man, alone or with a disciple (guide), passed from one city to another, where he was warmly welcomed by the locals: most often the king (basil) or a wealthy aristocrat in their homes.  In the evening, at the usual dinner or at a special event - symposia (symposium - feast, booze, party), the aed began to sing his songs and did it until late at night.  He sang to the accompaniment of the four-stringed formingo (the progenitor of the lyre and late kithara), sang about the gods and their lives, heroes and exploits, the ancient kings and events directly related to the audience, because they all certainly considered themselves direct descendants of those mentioned in these very songs.  And there were many such songs.  ‚ÄúThe Iliad‚Äù and ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù have come down to us completely, but it is known that only the whole epic Kickle existed about the events in Troy (the cycle, in our opinion, the Greeks didn‚Äôt have the letter ‚Äút‚Äù, but to us many Greek words Kickle, cynic came in Latinized form: cycle, cyclops, cynic) from more than 12 poems.  You may be surprised, reader, but in the Iliad there is no description of the Trojan horse, the poem ends somewhat earlier than the fall of Ilion.  We learn about the horse from ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù and other poems of the cyclic cycle, in particular from the poets ‚ÄúThe Death of Ilion‚Äù Arktin.  Everything is very interesting, but it does not lead to a topic leading away from the topic, therefore I speak about it only in passing. <br><br>  Yes, we call the Iliad a poem, but it was a song (until now its chapters continue to be called songs).  Aed did not read, but he sang protrudingly to the sounds of the strings from the bullish veins, using a polished bone - plectrum as a mediator (another hello from antiquity), and the enchanted listeners, knowing the outline of the events described, savored the details. <br><br>  Iliad and Odyssey are very big poems.  More than 15 thousand and more than 12 thousand lines, respectively.  And so they were sung for many evenings.  It was very similar to modern TV shows.  In the evenings, the listeners gathered again around the aade and with a sinking heart, and in some places with tears and laughter listened to the continuation of the stories sung yesterday.  The longer and more interesting the series, the longer people stay attached to it.  Thus, the aads: lived and fed from their listeners while they listened to their long songs. <br><br><blockquote> "The cloud collector Zeus Kronid, the lord over all, the hips burned, <br>  And then sat down for the richest feast ... and enjoyed. <br>  The divine singer sang under the banding, Demodek honored by all people.  " </blockquote><br>  Homer.  "Odyssey" <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a53/ba6/d49/a53ba6d49e25e81e8adb050380428bee.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  So, it's time to get straight to the point.  We have a craft of aedov, aadov themselves, very long poems-songs and the absence of writing.  How did these poems come down to us from the thirteenth century BC? <br><br>  But before one more important detail.  We say ‚Äúpoems‚Äù because their text was poetic, poetic (verse is another ancient Greek word meaning ‚Äústructure‚Äù) <br><br>  According to the historian of antiquity, Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Evgenievich Surikov: poetry is much better remembered and passed down from generation to generation.  ‚ÄúTry to memorize prose, especially a large piece, and poetry ‚Äî I can immediately reproduce a number of poems that I learned back in school,‚Äù he told us.  And it is true.  Each of us remembers at least a few verse lines (or even poems) and few people remember at least a complete paragraph taken from prose. <br><br>  The ancient Greeks did not use rhymes, although they knew it.  The basis of poetry was rhythm, in which a certain alternation of long and long syllables formed poetic dimensions: yabm, trochee, dactyl, amphibrach, and others (this is an almost complete list of the poetic dimensions of modern poetry).  The Greeks of this size was a huge set.  They knew rhyme, but did not use it.  But the rhythmic variety gave a variety of styles: trochei, sponday, sapphic verse, alkeyeva stanza and of course the famous hexameter.  My favorite size is iambic trimeter.  (joke) Meter - means measure.  Another word to our collection. <br><br>  Hexameter was a poetic size for hymns (hymnos - a prayer to the gods) and epic poems like Homer's.  You can talk about him for a long time, let me just say that many, and much later, including Roman poets, wrote with a hexameter, for example Virgil in his ‚ÄúAeneid‚Äù - an imitation poem ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù, in which the main character Aeneas escapes from destroyed Troy in their new homeland - Italy. <br><blockquote>  "He is a river - and it became bitter to Pelid: a mighty heart <br>  In the hero of the vlasat between two waves of thoughts: <br>  Or, without having pulled the sword straight from the vagina, <br>  Oncoming to scatter him and kill the lord Atrida; <br>  Or to humble the savagery, curbing the grieving soul ... " </blockquote><br>  Homer.  ‚ÄúIliad‚Äù (trans. Gnedich) <br><br>  As I think it said, the Ades began to sing the events of the Trojan War almost immediately after its completion.  Thus, in the Odyssey, the title character, being away from home, in the tenth year of wandering hears a song about himself in the Aed and begins to cry, hiding tears from everyone under the cloak. <br><br>  So, it turns out, the songs appeared in the XIII century, Homer sang his ‚ÄúIliad‚Äù in the VIII century.  Her canonical text was recorded 200 years later, in the 6th century BC in Athens under the tyrant of Pisistrat.  How did these texts arise and reach us?  And the answer is the following: Each subsequent edit modified the source code of previous authors, and often ‚Äúforked‚Äù other people's songs and did it for granted, as it was considered the norm.  Copyright at that time not only did not exist, very often and much later, with the emergence of writing, the ‚Äúcopyright opposite‚Äù functioned: when a little-known author signed his works with a loud name, since he believed, with good reason, that he would ensure success of his work. <br><br>  Git'om for the dissemination of the source code served as students and listeners of airs, who later became singers, as well as contests of airs, which were held periodically and in which they could hear each other.  So, for example, it was believed that once Homer and Hesiod reached the final of the poets and that, according to numerous judges, Hesiod won the first place, oddly enough.  (why I omit here) <br><br>  Each performance of his song by the aedom was an act not only performing, but also creative: he composed his song every time from a whole series of ready-made blocks and phrases - formulas, with a certain amount of improvisation and borrowing, polishing and changing pieces of the ‚Äúcode "On the fly."  At the same time, since the events and persons were well known to the audience, he did this based on a certain ‚Äúcore‚Äù and, not unimportantly, in a special poetic dialect - a programming language, as we would say now.  Just imagine how this looks like a modern code: introductory variables, condition blocks and loops, events, formulas, and all this in a special dialect different from the spoken language!  Following the dialect was very strict and after centuries of different poetic works were written in their own special dialects (Ionian, Aeolian, Dorian), regardless of where the author came from!  Just observing the requirements for the "code"! <br><br>  So from borrowing each other canonical text was born.  Obviously, he himself borrowed Homer himself, but unlike those who had sunk into oblivion (summer is one of the rivers of the underworld of Hades, which threatened oblivion) ‚Äã‚Äãhe did it brilliantly, by compiling one of many songs, making a single, bright, imaginative and unmatched content option.  Otherwise, his name also remained unknown and would have been replaced by other authors.  It was the genius of his ‚Äútext‚Äù that was memorized by generations of singers after him (it was undoubtedly overworked, but to a much lesser extent), which ensured him a place in history.  In this regard, Homer became such a difficult peak, a standard, figuratively speaking, a monolithic ‚Äúcore‚Äù of the entire ecosystem of songs, which, according to scientists, reached its written canonization in the version closest to the original.  And this seems to be true.  It's amazing how beautiful its text!  And how it is perceived by the prepared reader.  No wonder, Homer was admired by Pushkin and Tolstoy, so that Tolstoy, Alexander the Great himself, never a day parted with the scroll of the Iliad - just a historically recorded act. <br><br>  I mentioned above the Trojan cycle, which consisted of a series of works reflecting a particular episode of the Trojan War.  In part, these were peculiar "forks" of Homer's Iliad, written in hexameter and completing the episodes that were not reflected in the Iliad.  Almost all of them either did not reach us at all, or reached it in fragments.  This is the court of history - apparently, they were much inferior to Homer and did not become so widely distributed among the population. <br><br>  Summarize.  A certain strict language of songs, formulas of which they were formed, freedom of distribution and, most importantly, their openness to constant modifications of others - this is what we now call opensource - originated at the dawn of our culture.  In the field of copyright and at the same time collective creativity.  It is a fact.  In general, much of what we consider to be ultramodern can be found in centuries.  And what we consider new may have existed before.  In this regard, I recall the words from the Bible, from the "Ecclesiastes" (attributed to King Solomon): <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúSomething happens that says:‚Äú look, this is new, ‚Äùbut it was already in the centuries that were before us.</i>  <i>There is no memory of the former;</i>  <i>Yes, and that will be, there will be no memory of those who will be after ... "</i> <br><br>  end of part 1 <br><br>  School (schola) - entertainment, free time. <br>  The Academy is a grove not far from Athens, the seat of the school of philosophy of Plato <br>  Gymnasium (hymn - naked) - gymnasium called sports halls for training the body.  In them, the boys were engaged in naked.  Hence the common words: gymnastics, gymnast. <br>  Philosophy (phil - to love, Sophia - wisdom) - the queen of sciences. <br>  Physics (physics - nature) - the doctrine of the material world, nature <br>  Metaphysics - literally "Out of nature."  Aristotle did not know where to count the divine and called the work like this: ‚ÄúNot nature‚Äù. <br>  Math (Math - lesson) - Lessons <br>  Technique (tehni - craft) in Greece - artists and sculptors, as well as manufacturers of clay jugs, were technicians, craftsmen.  Hence the "craft of the artist" <br>  The choir is originally a dance.  (hence the choreography).  Later, since the dances were performed with the singing of many, the chorus - the many-voiced singing. <br>  Scene (skene) - a dressing tent for artists.  It was in the center of the amphitheater. <br>  Guitar - from the ancient Greek "cifara", a stringed musical instrument. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455060/</a></p>
