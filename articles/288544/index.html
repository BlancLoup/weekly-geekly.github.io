I decided to take a break from the struggle of popular bloggers for new readers and just to pamper you and myself with pleasant intellect-friendly texts that are nowhere to be found in blogs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll start <a href="http://evilcartman.livejournal.com/378560.html">with a personal appeal to every moron</a> .  No, it's not me that rude attitude to my favorite readers, and Angry Cartman - negatively to illiterate people.  Tough, but fair: ‚Äú <em>You think that you are throwing a worthy challenge to those who require you to at least briefly turn on your brain and begin to respect your culture? Do not be surprised when the people around you start to overstep you over like a smelly, stupid pig. Believing that you hide it your incomplete development behind the monitor screen, you decide to go across the rules that existed before you for decades. Prepare to be crushed and mixed with crap, which you deserve</em> . " <br><br>  Do you know that there <a href="http://pavel-slob.livejournal.com/24651.html">will be war</a> in Germany in 2015?  The war between Muslims and Christians.  A vivid example of world paranoia that overshadows the mind.  To all appearances, tolerance is becoming so fashionable that under its influence people become stupid and take any statements at face value.  Perhaps it is time to prepare for war.

      Every correct parent can <a href="http://snandulija.livejournal.com/86842.html">talk endlessly</a> about his beloved child.  By the way, my mother also told me that if I‚Äôm small, I‚Äôm quiet, so expect trouble - either the wallpapers are painted, and my mother‚Äôs favorite lipstick, or I play a submarine with my father‚Äôs camera.  Under the link you will find a small collection of stories about children.  I was particularly impressed with the photo album: ‚Äú <em>Dad! I have a present for you!‚Äù The boy Ignat cried to papa. He handed out an album for drawing. From first to the very end, the album was plastered with rows of beautiful oval portraits of worthy people: there were several George Washington. one is Abraham Lincoln, from the Alexandrov Hamilton page, Andrew Jackson, Willis S. Grant, but, basically, as is customary in Russia, Benjamin Franklin. Papa Dima then wept. Then - because at first he almost had an apoplexy blow</em> " . <br><br>  The exposure of the century takes place right next to us, and <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/_adept_/48362.html">we do not even suspect</a> !  "The <em>stunning news is that any computer collected after 1993 and connected to the network via Ethernet can remotely listen to and remove any information from it, and the number of firewalls, gateways, routers between the victim and the hacker is irrelevant In addition, you can determine exactly where and at what address this computer is located. From now on, no one can feel safe!</em> "We are all like a friendly crowd like a herd of frisky pigs, we‚Äôll follow the link and find out all the details.  As I wrote two paragraphs above, paranoia blooms and smells, take care of your fingers, beware of open spaces and twisted wires. <br><br>  If Pushkin were our contemporary, what would <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/zhaba_elite/14054.html">he look like</a> ?  Hell fotozhaba.  Over the sweetest Alexander Sergeyevich, they mocked with gusto and with some charm.  Two pages of comments with a person familiar with the textbooks of Russian literature.  And how do you see Pushkin?  Maybe we at the expense of the editors to stir up a similar contest about Francis ‚ÄúPrinting Everything Any‚Äù Skaryna? <br><br>  The theme of the images continues with the next entry in the diary.  I want to have <a href="http://cypa.livejournal.com/4060634.html">such a calendar</a> !  A wonderful synthesis of photos 50-60 with funny captions.  For example: ‚Äú <em>Wow! We have celebrated the New Year, and this morning, no hangover, and all the holidays are ahead!‚Äù Svetlana rejoiced, not knowing that today is January 14th</em> . <br><br>  How to make money enough for everything and a little left or just <a href="http://alekcei.livejournal.com/20651.html">about loot</a> .  Handbook for beginners and continuing misers, greedy and just zealous people.  For an entire eleven points, it is told what absolutely cannot be done to protect your finances.  Something with which I fully agree: ‚Äú <em>With feminine stupidity to fight the ruble. Girls are what they are - oh, you have to buy it, oh, you have it, everyone has it, but we don‚Äôt have it, you don‚Äôt have to wear it, the child needs it, the child needs it ... Most women in my head the statement: ‚ÄúI want my child to be the best.‚Äù I used to think that the phrase ‚Äúthe best‚Äù was in this phrase. Over the years I realized that I was wrong. For women, the key word is ‚Äúeverything.‚Äù They need just everything. Therefore, the only way to fight it is to make a woman pay for her own stupidities. First, on her</em>  <em>you don‚Äôt buy a lot of nonsense wages, and secondly, when you earn money by work, but you don‚Äôt take it in a bedside table, nonsense dissolves very quickly. Love is a mutual feeling and it is confirmed first of all by real deeds, not by whispering sweet words in your ear. ‚ÄúLet the woman work, too, and not sit at the window, waiting for her beloved, with painted nails. Especially since women have been fighting for equal rights with men for so long</em> ." <br><br>  And again <a href="http://lagira.livejournal.com/72522.html">about the children</a> .  Also about the little ones, but this time the look of the teacher.  The leitmotif of the text is a special perception of the world by children, with specific examples: ‚Äú <em>Vovka is small, disheveled. Old grandmother leads to classes, combs, kisses ... And after a minute he is disheveled again, like a little sparrow. Mom is an alcoholic. Son beats with mortal combat. Then he cries, asks for forgiveness. He drinks and again thumps mercilessly. At class I talk about hares. I always ask children "What do you think, and why does the little hare of its young hare-leaf-leaves leave alone under a bush? Feeds and leaves?" Puff, keep silent, will come</em>  <em>flushes, how to justify a hare ... "Can I say, zaychiha - bad mother?" Vova gets up, wiping the tears on the cheeks (zaychatok sorry), yells: "Nooo !!! Moms are not bad !!! Do not come in!"</em> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/users/karmilan/post26430673">The dialogue of the student with the professor</a> .  Is there a god?  Is there evil?  Cold?  Dark?  The answers to these, undoubtedly, very important questions for us now you can find here.  And also the answer to the question whether it makes sense to be excreted in the presence of Albert Einstein. <br><br>  To all hockey fans, Hockey On Red Square, <a href="http://drugoi.livejournal.com/2034208.html">Russia - World Team</a> .  Just a joy for the eyes of any fan, beautiful photos of idols of past years, again dressed in the shape of the USSR - Fetisov, Tretyak, Nemchinov, Kasatonov, Larionov, Makarov, Yakushev, trainers Tikhonov and Yurzinov and many, many others ... We look and feel nostalgic! <br><br>  And again about the children, the book " <a href="http://aperto.livejournal.com/38459.html">How the King went to the girls</a> ."  No comments. <br><br>  Someone is already starting to sum up, <a href="http://drugoi.livejournal.com/2034461.html">2006 in photos</a> .  It is very interesting to look at frozen moments and remember.  Zidane and Materazzi, caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed, Olympics in Turin, war in Lebanon, funeral of a soldier, Voskresenskaya mine, Agassi: Goodbye Tennis, Madonna in Moscow, snowy winter in Japan, Francesco Totti and the World Cup and much more what got into the lens this year. <br><br>  <strong>Alexey Albertovich Khaletsky</strong> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006500601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 50, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288544/</a></p>
