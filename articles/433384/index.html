The topic is very topical and I am very glad that the text I wrote made thousands of people think, not only habravchan, but also in general readers far from IT. <br><br>  All this is very informative and interesting, but only when it exists only on paper and in the form of stories from the Internet.  Absolutely different impressions when something starts to touch you personally.  Ironically, this story happened to me last month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ew/fj/ny/ewfjnyegxgelelijumcabxdmc3m.jpeg" width="700">

      For a start, a little background.  Five and a half years ago I moved to Germany and now I rent an apartment in Moscow.  Residents planned to move out, so it was time to do some repairs before inviting new ones.  However, for several years, I was haunted by the desire to make not just repairs, but quality repairs with a small redevelopment, thereby improving the living conditions of my future residents, who will receive premium housing. <br><br>  Who would have thought that the elementary act of drawing up redevelopment documents would lead to a meeting with hellish corruption and the most blatant disregard for personal data laws? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Corruption schemes with real estate in Moscow </h1><br>  I did not have time to deal with bureaucratic problems for a long time, so I listened to the council to go to one of the offices, which would prepare a redevelopment project for Moszhilinspetsii.  This project, in turn, I planned to carry myself to Moszhilinspektsiyu, and then, having received permission (redevelopment elementary), bring the final package of documents to the MFC. <br><br>  I came to the office and told in detail about my case.  He showed his own schemes and drawings, sketches, which remained to arrange in a well-designed project.  For Germany, the situation is absolutely standard: to delegate work to professionals with engineering education who will do everything correctly.  How wrong I was thinking that this approach was also common in Russia. <br><br>  The girl manager smiled sweetly and assured for a long time that "everything is under our control," mentioning "the most reliable contacts in Moszhilnspektsii and BTI."  It turns out that you can carry out all the documents without my presence and even without the repair itself.  And you can make repairs, and spend on the documents later!  Anything you want can be.  But not what I needed. <br><br>  To be honest, I had little experience with the Russian bureaucratic realities, since I left Russia immediately after graduating from the university.  Looking at things through the eyes of a European person, I found all these loopholes to bypass the lawful order of things ... very specific.  I will not say that I was very surprised, but the situation was unpleasant. <br><br><h1>  So what about personal data? </h1><br>  I didn‚Äôt need these tricky schemes.  I had to do everything according to the law!  Just a draft to make and correctly execute.  But the manager continued to assert: ‚Äúwhy should you waste time, we will prepare the project and conduct it through inspections‚Äù (the word ‚Äúspend‚Äù during the conversation sounded 20 times).  In the end, she called the sum with four zeros, which "only" need to pay for the "turnkey service!" <br><br>  Realizing that I‚Äôll turn around and leave, the girl changed her tone and angrily said that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come to our people anyway, everyone works through us, our base is in Moscow, everything is cheaper for us‚Äù. <br><br>  This of course made me angry enough, I already thought of looking for a firm better and more decently (there are such people! I don‚Äôt believe that they aren‚Äôt), but ... The second half of the sentence seemed more interesting to me.  <b>BASE.</b>  <b>EVERYONE HAS.</b> <br><br>  Oh, in vain you, girl, mentioned such.  Politely promising to consider the proposal, I left.  And then he got a taste, giving free rein to the imagination and talent of social engineering! <br><br>  Two days later I decided to call the company, introducing myself as an employee of a construction company, who often faced clients' requests for redevelopment.  I was advised by partners!  Let's collaborate!  Is it possible to get access to the database of real estate transactions in Moscow?  We give you clients a redevelopment bureaucracy, and you give us clients who need repairs themselves. <br><br>  They actively greet me and begin to switch for a long time, they take me to a manager (well, at least not the girl who killed my brain for two hours), who turned out to be in an incredibly good mood.  Still would!  Call for fruitful cooperation. <br><br>  I was asked to send an email with specific offers of interest, which I did on that very day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ev/ry/ux/evryuxrt-wx4larieoj4locm7ce.jpeg"><br><br>  The next morning I received a response. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/cu/yk/bhcuykspg5m4aa99nlhyovqpnt4.jpeg" width="800"><br><br>  Awesome, isn't it?  And not only a bunch of spelling errors and layout a la MS Word 97 are great here ... <br><br>  It seems that this corruption scheme is actively working in Moscow, and probably all, in other Russian cities.  Without a doubt, except for rogues from the lodged offices, the employees of Moszhilinspektsii, Moscomarchitecture, BTI, and Rosreestra share in the share.  I will add that I came across offers on similar ‚Äúdownloads‚Äù on websites where they sell personal data, but here everything is too frank and impudent.  And it is expensive, by the way, that speaks of a whole chain of intermediaries in kickbacks. <br><br>  If, even solving such a trivial problem, there is a huge corruption infrastructure offering ‚Äúevery whim for your money‚Äù, is it any wonder the demolition of historic buildings in cities, construction of terrible shopping centers and unsuitable for life ant-towers outside the safety standards? <br><br>  Having spent two weeks in Moscow, I went back to Berlin, so, unfortunately, without having resolved the issue with the big renovation of my apartment.  Apparently, he will be postponed for another couple of years. <br><br>  What is the moral of this whole story? <br>  Moral propose to make readers. <br><br>  <i>PS: When compiling the material, I thought for a long time, but in the end I did not advertise the names of the managers and the name of this unscrupulous company.</i>  <i>Googling redevelopment services in Moscow - you will quickly find all these "turnkey services".</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Firstly, for reasons of my own safety and the security of my property, since they have the address of my Moscow apartment (and knowing how bases are sold, I understand perfectly how you can find out about my border crossings).</i>  <i>Secondly, in order not to violate the rules of Habr, even in an indirect way (yet Habr was and remains "Habr is not a complaint book").</i> <br><br>  <i>The article for Habr was prepared by Chris The Rebel (Vladimir Adoshev)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433384/</a></p>
