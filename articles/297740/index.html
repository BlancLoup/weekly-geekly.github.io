  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electronic document management in the enterprise</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From school I dreamed of making a living by programming.  But now programming helps to organize their own and other people's projects, gives only a small income.  The main time I spend on working with documents in a fairly large enterprise.  For two years of work, I studied in detail the ‚ÄúCase‚Äù system from the EOS company and superficially got acquainted with the document management solution from the 1C company.  Under the cat, a comparison of these two systems is given and my <i>subjective</i> opinion is expressed. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Why do we need a document flow? </h2><br>  Each enterprise is a structure.  The larger the firm, the more complex and confusing the structure becomes.  The addition of structure, the more internal orders, orders, acts created in the company.  All of the above documents create a huge flow of paper in the company.  In the case of decentralization of such a document, to track the movement of securities is impossible, therefore, the company may experience serious problems.  It is possible to centralize paper documents, but it is very expensive, since it is necessary to maintain a huge staff.  The human factor also makes it possible to hide from the manager the real situation in the enterprise.  The other side of the issue of managing a large enterprise is tracking the execution of orders given in orders and instructions.  In the case of a large number of non-structured instructions it is difficult to track and verify the implementation.  And a fire or other loss of documents can result in critical losses for the enterprise.  Thus, the use of paper workflow for a large company is not the right management decision. <br><br><h2>  And what are the options? </h2><br>  Based on the above prerequisites, it is logical to use electronic document management systems that will ensure the transparency and visibility of the management processes taking place in the company.  There are a lot of document management systems, in my article I will compare two such solutions: the ‚Äú1c: document circulation‚Äù system and the system from the EOS ‚ÄúDelo‚Äù company.

      <br>
      1C: document circulation began to develop in 2010.  Since then, the system has undergone many changes and, the current version is number 2.0.  During this time, the document management system from 1c has managed to gain sufficient influence on the market of document circulation systems.  Such software products are used by such companies as Gazprom, Petrovsky Autocentre and others.  In turn, the Matter program from the EOS company, which has been developed since 1994, is owned by many government organizations such as the State Duma, the Federation Council, the Investigation Committee, the local government of many cities and regions, and other state structures.  Also, this program is used by many representatives of large businesses in Russia, such as VTB Bank, the international airports of the city of Ufa and Kazan. <br><br>  Thus, from the above information, we can conclude that the ‚ÄúCase‚Äù is a large, time-tested, scalable office management system.  A solution from the company 1c younger, modern, flexible software. <br><br><h2>  And what about the money goes? </h2><br>  For an in-depth comparison of these solutions, consider the issue of deployment and operation of these systems.  After the firm or enterprises, or other structure are determined with the need to use the workflow system, the question of purchase arises.  When buying a system, an important factor is the price of the system.  It is impossible to say which system is more expensive or cheaper, since both manufacturing companies provide individual business proposals for each buying company, depending on the structure of buying companies.  The price depends on the number of users, on the set of various options, modules, on the duration and types of license (untimely license or license for a period of several years). <br><br>  To compare prices, we take a conditional commercial enterprise in which 400 employees will use the document flow.  The price is made up of three factors: the cost of the 1C configuration: Document flow, the cost of the 1C server license: Pre-Enterprise and the cost of the client license 1C: Pre-Company.  Thus, the cost of the workflow system for our conditional company is more than half a million rubles.  If you divide this cost by the number of employees, it turns out that buying a license to work in 1C: Document management costs the company no more than an office chair for each employee.  If the company already uses 1C: Enterprise, then start using this program can be much cheaper.  The individual configuration cost is about one hundred and fifty thousand rubles.  However, after purchase, the system cannot be immediately exploited.  This system must be implemented in existing business processes.  To do this, many of the business processes taking place in the enterprise need to be changed.  This requires a long time of work of a whole team of 1C programmers and several auditors.  As a rule, for the implementation of this system, firms use the services of third-party firms.  The cost of the services of these companies vary in the region of 2500 rubles for one hour of work.  According to approximate calculations for our company, the cost of implementation will be about two hundred thousand rubles.  Having added some administrative expenses, connected with the transition to an electronic document management system, we get that the budget of a conditional company for the implementation of an electronic document management system from 1C company needs to include at least two million rubles. <br><br>  Consider the approximate cost of implementing the Cases system in the same conditional company.  In the minimum configuration, if there are 400 people working in the Case system, the cost of a license for one person will be 7,200 rubles.  Thus, the purchase of this system will cost 2880 thousand rubles.  However, the introduction of this system is technically simpler process, the company can cope with it using the work of full-time IT staff.  Thus, the introduction of the Case system from the EOS company, including management expenses, will cost the company around three million rubles. <br><br>  The cost of launching an electronic document management system from the EOS company is one and a half times more expensive than launching a similar product from 1C. <br><br><h2>  Something is all confused.  So what to choose? </h2><br>  Compare the capabilities of these software products, to make recommendations on the choice of workflow system. <br>  First consider the <i>common points of</i> both systems. <br><ol><li>  Both systems provide the opportunity to learn how to work in the company's offices, and provide demos. </li><li>  Common to systems is the ability to log in via a mobile device or browser.  However, in the program from the company EOS these options are purchased separately. </li><li>  Integration with other programs of the company 1C.  Naturally, the system 1C: Document management is able to do this.  But the Case program also has this ability: for a fee, the EOS company provides an API that allows access from 1C to the documents and modules of the Case program.  Thus, the interaction between Cause and 1C: Enterprise is no more difficult than the interaction between 1C: Document circulation and 1C: Enterprise. </li><li>  High security.  Both programs support SSL protocol, access through a couple of login and password, delegation of rights, audit of the log of all actions and file encryption.  It is also worth noting that the Case System supports input via the electronic signature key and the signing of files. </li><li>  The ability to control the execution of orders.  Both of these programs own out of the box. </li><li>  Both programs comply with all requirements of Russian legislation and national standards. </li></ol><br><br>  Now we will spend time studying the <i>differences in</i> these systems. <br><ol><li>  The system from 1C is a configuration for the 1C enterprise system.  As a result, the entire configuration code is open and can be changed during deployment.  This is both a plus and a minus at the same time.  On the one hand, open source gives more flexibility to the system, but, on the other hand, leads to higher costs for implementation and maintenance.  Any programmer is not immune from errors, and to find such an error is sometimes very difficult, and, therefore, expensive.  The system from the company EOS passes multiple testing and is operated in a number of large companies and, in unchanged form, is delivered to the buyer.  The possibility of a programmer's error, with such a development of events, is practically excluded. </li><li>  The system from the company EOS is sold and, therefore, maintained, centrally, while the system from 1C is distributed through a network of partners, which creates a risk to meet an unreliable supplier, which, in turn, may face untimely support, configuration errors and other financial problems. </li></ol><br><br>  Based on the above, I recommend using the 1C system: Document management for small and medium businesses, as it is a cheaper system in operation, provides greater flexibility and possibility of changes.  Instead, it loses its reliability and ease of use.  I recommend to large business and government agencies to use the Case system, which, to the detriment of price and flexibility, provides greater reliability.  A loss of finances due to price differences is not so significant for such huge structures. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297740/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297740/</a></p>
