But if the hunt for changing places does not allow you to enjoy the familiar look for a long time, one of the solutions is to buy a motorhome, at the same time a vehicle and a comfortable dwelling for rest.  Traveling in motor homes is popular in Europe.  In today's Russia, rest on wheels has not gained mass popularity, but as the necessary infrastructure appears, this gap can be filled in a short time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/677/a2e/968/677a2e9681277448ed0b617236d294e0.jpg" width="450" height="299" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Technique and fiction</strong> <br><br>  The motorhome market is mainly represented by foreign models.  Motorhomes produced on the chassis of well-known car brands (Mercedes Sprinter, Ford Transit, Fiat Duato, etc.).  According to Andrei Leshin, the owner of Auto Travel, the entire list of manufacturers of motorhomes takes from 45 to 105 lines.  European ones are Adria, Burstner, CI (Caravans Internasional), Chausson, Dethleffs, Eura Mobile, Fendt, Hobby, Hymer, Knaus, LMC, Rollerteam, Tabbert, and others. Statistics on the high demand for motorhomes: in 2005 Europe, they were sold 80,237.

      In Russia, the figures are much lower.  According to Evgenia Levinskaya, marketing director of the Hymer representative office in Russia, more than 100 autohouses have been sold since the company first appeared on the Russian market in 2003.  The company "World of Kupava" noted that unit sales accounted for the motorhomes.  Among the buyers are not only individuals, but also organizations. <br><br>  For example, motor homes on the basis of "GAZelle" "Kupava-3780" acquired circus "Chapito", "Mosfilm", studio "TRITE" Nikita Mikhalkov.  The production of motor homes was set up in Belarus, having purchased technology and equipment in Europe for these purposes, and the chassis from the Russian GAZ-3302. <br><br>  In motor homes of integrated type from serial cars, only the engine, transmission and suspension are used.  The cabin is combined with the living space of the motorhome.  Integrated motorhomes have excellent maneuverability and speed characteristics, are distinguished by luxury in the interior decoration.  In semi-integrated homes, a residential compartment is installed on the chassis of a production car.  Due to the absence of an alcove in the residential building (a niche above the cabin where a berth is equipped), as provided for in the alcove motorhomes, the car has increased maneuverability and speed characteristics at lower fuel costs. <br><br>  Produced autohouses also differ in size, gross weight, number of beds, engine size, capacity of drinking water tanks and other indicators.  One of the most compact models - Hymer Van (based on the Ford chassis) belongs to the family of Hymer.  The length is 597 cm, the width is 207 cm, and the height is 275 cm. As standard, the car is equipped with airbags for the driver and passenger, ABS and reinforced tires.  However, only two people will be able to embark on a comfortable journey on this car. <br><br>  The Kupava-3780 motorhome is also one of the most compact models: its dimensions are 630 √ó 220 x 277 cm. But unlike the German motorhome in Russia, depending on the model and equipment, it can travel from two to five people. <br><br>  The model range of the Hymer B-Star-Line concern, manufactured on the chassis of the Mercedes Sprinter 316, includes five models from 639 to 740 cm long. Burstner motorhomes on the Fiat Duato 18 chassis are 685 to 821 cm long and can comfortably fit four up to six people. <br><br>  Motorhomes are equipped with motors of different power.  In the base "Kupava" one of the most low-powered was installed - only 95 liters.  with.  In the motorhome Ahorn Camp TF 620 on the chassis of the Ford Transit 350 - 115 l.  with., and in the model Ahorn Camp M 690 on the chassis of the Mercedes Sprinter 313 - 156 liters.  with. <br><br>  <strong>Sim, open up!</strong> <br><br>  According to Andrei Leshin, motor homes, like hotels, are ranked by the number of stars - from one to five.  What class is chosen autohouse, so will be its interior.  Individual models have up to 160 types of various layouts and lineups, and several dozens of types of fabric and leather are used for decoration. <br><br>  The interior space of the motorhome looks like a very small apartment, where every inch of space is functional, but everything looks homely in general. <br><br>  In the Kupava motorhome, the situation is rather ordinary, resembling an inexpensive hotel room.  The basic package includes a kitchen unit that includes a gas stove, autonomous water supply system of 50 liters with heated water and a small refrigerator of 70 liters.  In the bathroom there are a washbasin, a shower with a tray and a toilet.  The living room is located built-in wardrobe with mezzanine, luggage compartment.  Sleeping places are transformed into a table and a sofa for seating.  The optimal temperature conditions provide air conditioning and heating system. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b60/318/70d/b6031870d1791d0a28db0abd279155df.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  KUPAVA 3780 based on GAZ 3302 chassis <br><br>  Salon Hymer Van - this is exactly the apartment.  The dining group with a sofa and swivel chairs, a transverse bed at the back of the motorhome, a spacious luggage compartment and a wardrobe, a transformer shower cubicle is built in the bathroom.  The kitchen is equipped with a gas stove, refrigerator, sink, clean water supply - 80 l.  The cabin has a ventilation hatch, a heater with a built-in boiler for 12 liters of water.  The windows and doors of the cabin mosquito and blackout blinds. <br><br>  A more luxurious B-Star-Line model is distinguished by a spacious wardrobe, special sections for storing luggage, in the cabin there is an increased thermal protection of the walls, a 130-liter drinking water tank.  Furniture upholstery is made to order from 17 options, including two types of leather. <br><br>  The most prestigious mobile homes are Hymer S-class models.  Analogue is a suite of 5-star hotel.  All motorhomes are equipped with adjustable <br><br>  height with driver's and front passenger's belts and airbags, spacious luggage compartments, heated rear-view mirrors, potable water tanks of 120 to 160 liters, two residential compartment batteries and one starter battery, as well as heaters for heated water heating floor, air heating and water heating and heating the driver's cabin.  In such a house you can comfortably travel in summer and winter. <br><br>  The standard equipment of the S-Class motorhome includes a 17-inch LCD TV.  The kitchen is equipped with a gas stove with three burners, an oven, a powerful extractor hood, a 150-liter two-door refrigerator, a sink, a retractable bar with fixtures for glasses and bottles.  But the dishwasher is installed only on special order. <br><br>  <strong>Who can afford?</strong> <br><br>  "Kupava-3780" in the base version costs about $ 17,000, but there are more expensive models.  Prices for European autohouses are much higher.  However, as the dealer network of companies selling high-quality goods increased, it became possible to buy motorhomes on credit.  Currently, Hymer has six official dealers in Russia.  Three companies operate in Moscow (Caravan Center, Kemper Center, Comtransavto), one each in St. Petersburg, Ufa and Yekaterinburg. <br><br>  A popular model of motor homes in Russia - Hymer Camp Classic, alcove motorhomes.  In the West, B-class motorhomes are best sold.  This is due to the fact that abroad this kind of recreation and travel has existed for many years, and Europeans value comfort and quality when traveling.  For example, the Ahorn Camp TF 620 model, designed for four people, on the Ford Transit chassis (115 hp engine) costs about 48,000 euros.  The representative of the same lineup Ahorn Camp TF 690, but designed for seven people, is sold for 52 970 euros.  Motorhome Ahorn Camp M 690 on the chassis of the Mercedes Sprinter 316 with an engine capacity of 156 liters.  with., calculated on six, costs about 60 000 euros. <br><br>  The prices for the Bursher Elegance model motor homes on the Fiat Duato 18 chassis exceed 80,000 euros.  According to Andrei Leshin, the most expensive middle-class autohouse (body type integrated), taking into account all customs duties, costs 150,000 euros. <br><br>  All exclusive motorhomes are made to order, like a yacht.  Motorhomes S-class chassis Mercedes cost about 200,000 euros.  In the Russian market, depending on the configuration, the cost of the S-Class ‚Äúhumer mobile‚Äù can vary from 180,000 to 250,000 euros.  The most expensive house in the luxury series - Niesmann-Bieshoff costs from 500,000 euros.  But in Russia it is not represented.  In general, prices for Luxury Bus can reach up to 2.5 million euros. <br><br>  <strong>House for rent</strong> <br><br>  But buying a motorhome is not necessary.  It can be rented.  Rental services in the capital alone are provided by several companies.  As was reported at the representative office of Hymer, the fact that the rental of motorhomes was a turn this summer is indicative of the positive dynamics of demand for motorhomes in Russia, the entire rental fleet was in demand.  According to Levinsky, only one metropolitan dealer of the Hymer company, who opened the rental of motorhomes, from April to May issued a lease for more than 200 people. <br><br>  Rental rates are closely tied to the seasons and the lease term.  For example, in the "Auto Travel" in the high season, falling on the summer months, renting a house on wheels, where four people can comfortably travel for 3-11 days, will be 180 euros per day.  In the middle season (this is April - May and September), the rental day will cost 145 euros, and the lowest (from January to April and from October to January) - 125 euros.  In the company "World of Kupava" you can rent a Russian autohouse, the rental conditions are discussed individually. <br><br>  The minimum cost of one day rental at official dealers Hymer is 160 euros.  For example, in the company "Caravan Center", the autohouse Hymer Exsis for four people for a period of three to seven days will cost 180 euros, and from 15 to 30 days - 160 euros per day.  The price includes insurance of CTP and CASCO with a deductible, compensation for possible minor repairs caused by normal wear and tear on the way.  But the route of the proposed trip must be previously agreed with the rolling station. <br><br>  In Europe, where an extensive network of companies renting out motorhomes has been established, the rates are at least a quarter lower than in Russia.  For a weekly use of a comfortable recreation facility, on average, they will take from 450 to 1,200 euros. <br><br>  Get a car for rent in Russia is easy.  For example, in the company ‚ÄúAuto Travel‚Äù in the winter and off-season order is carried out for two weeks, and in the summer - for four weeks.  The cost of booking is 20% of the rental amount.  Security deposit - 30 000 rubles.  At Hymer dealers, the conditions are almost the same, but the deposit is 500 euros. <br><br>  In Russia, a motorhome can only be rented by a person who has reached 23 years old and has a driving experience of at least two years.  A passport and driver's license of category B will be required. For comparison: in different countries of Europe there is also an age limit of 21-25 years, and the required driving experience is 1-3 years. <br><br>  <strong>Where to stay?</strong> <br><br>  Advantages of traveling in specially equipped cars - motor homes in Western Europe have long appreciated.  At present, in 17 countries, including Germany, Italy, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, etc., there are about 950 campgrounds, where they are ready to take on parking and provide thousands of autohouses with everything they need. <br><br>  Campgrounds, like hotels, have their own classification.  For example, camping on the territory of the Santalahti recreation center in the southern part of Finland is 5-star.  There is a cafe in the landscaped area, household buildings with a sauna and a laundry have been erected.  The grounds under the shed are equipped with a grill, a playground is organized.  Electric sockets are connected to the parking lot, there is a connection to cable TV and the Internet. <br><br>  The 3-star Rastila campground is located in the eastern part of Helsinki, 12 km from the city center.  Camping services are used year-round by autotourists from other countries, part of the route of which is visiting the Finnish capital.  On the territory there are 165 electrified parking places for mobile homes. <br><br>  Leading positions in the number of existing campgrounds are Germany, Austria and Italy.  For example, in Italy, 12 km from Naples, in a pine grove there is a tourist center, which includes a recreation center for local and foreign tourists and a camping area with extensive equipped parking.  On the territory there is a restaurant, several bars, equipment rental and equipment.  In the evenings, entertainment evenings are organized for all vacationers, discos for adults and children are held.  For traveling with animals in the campsite built enclosures where you can leave your pets for a while.  Nearby is a large equipped beach with a swimming pool, cafes and shops. <br><br>  Austrian camping "Arlberg" awarded "5 stars".  On the territory there is a parking lot, where next to the parking space there is a detached house with a bathroom.  The campsite also has a heated swimming pool, a sauna, a solarium, a barbecue area, a laundry room, a restaurant, shops, and a playground for children.  Cable TV is available. <br><br>  Currently, companies selling auto-campers themselves make up routes for tourists.  For example, in November and December 2006, the Karavan Center company offers two motor races in Europe.  For 22 days it will be possible to visit Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, France, Germany.  The trip includes not only rest with a stop at campgrounds (‚Äú3-5 stars‚Äù), but also an extensive excursion program.  The length of the route is 7342 km, the cost is 1500 euro per person.  Accommodation - from two to six people in one motorhome.  The payment includes the cost of visas and parking throughout the route.  Meals, gas and car fees are not included in the price. <br><br>  In Russia, the network of campgrounds is underdeveloped. According to experts, out of the existing campsites, the majority only with a stretch meet European standards.  At best, these are small recreation centers or simply equipped parking for cars. <br><br>  In the Russian representative office, Hymer gave only a few addresses where they are ready to receive and serve motorhomes.  So, in Moscow in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Rowing Canal is camping Krylatskoe.  On its territory there is a mini-hotel, restaurant, bar, bowling, billiards, sauna, equipped beach, there is a boat rental service. <br><br>  There are several campgrounds within a radius of up to 400 km from the Moscow Ring Road.  The closest to Moscow (140 km from Moscow Ring Road) is located in the Kaluga Region, 7 km from the city of Tarusa, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Brave Camp.  Territory - an open area on the banks of the Oka, where gazebos, barbecues, a sports ground are built.  Motorboat rental services are provided, as well as river cruises on the Oka river are organized. <br><br>  Camping "Suzdal" is located in the same city of the Vladimir region, 220 km from Moscow, on the territory of the Alexander Monastery.  For tourists there are gazebos, a Russian bath, barbecues, you can order an excursion program. <br><br>  In the Yaroslavl region opened two campsites.  One of them - "Major Pronin" is in with.  Zasechye, at the site of the confluence of the Pronya and Oka rivers, 255 km from the Moscow Ring Road.  A cafe, a bar, a billiard work on the territory, gazebos, a bathhouse, a smokehouse, barbecues are installed.  Provided by <br><br>  boat and snowmobile rental services.  The second is located in the village of Nikola (340 km from Moscow Ring Road) on the Rybinsk Reservoir and is called ‚ÄúSergey Vasilyevich‚Äù.  A tavern with a fireplace, billiards, a bath - this is the set of the proposed infrastructure.  Here is organized rental of boats, boats, fishing gear, snowmobiles.  For hunters are provided services for jaeger accompaniment. <br><br>  In the campsite "Upper Volga" on the lake Vselug in the Tver region (400 km from Moscow Ring Road) catering facilities are represented by a cafe and bar.  Entertainment - billiards, disco.  On the territory there is a football field, a sandy beach, organized rental of boats, boats, snowmobiles and fishing gear.  Additional services offered in Verkhnevolzhye include horse riding, sleigh rides, snowmobiles, horse riding lessons, motorboat excursions. <br><br>  The new hotel-tourist complex ‚ÄúRussian settlement‚Äù, where there is a parking for traveling in autocampers, recently opened in the south of the Valdai nature reserve, 360 km from Moscow.  The complex is stylized as an old Russian settlement and includes a restaurant and leisure center, where there is a gym, billiards, two Russian baths, and a dock. <br><br>  In the south of Russia, in the Astrakhan region (p. Selitrennoe), on the river Akhtuba, there is a camping ‚ÄúCool Coast‚Äù.  A mini-hotel, cafe, bar, billiards, smokehouse, sauna are open on the territory, food, boat and boat rental are organized. <br><br>  But in order for the number of Russians who prefer to travel in mobile homes, increased, existing campgrounds are not enough.  Currently, companies selling and renting motor homes in Russia are trying to change the situation on their own.  As Leshin said, Avto Travel is building a campsite on the coast of the Gulf of Finland, about 100 km from St. Petersburg.  It will be the first camping in Russia built according to the European standard.  The goal is ‚Äúto visually show what real camping is and how it is exploited.‚Äù <br><br>  Camping will be designed for the simultaneous stay of about 50 motorhomes.  An important detail - this campsite is specially built for caravaners from St. Petersburg.  For guests there will be only 10 places.  According to Andrei Leshin, the cost of the project is $ 400,000. According to the calculations of the company's specialists, the campsite will fully pay off for three seasons and will start making a profit in the fourth year. <br><br>  Parking of motor homes on the territory of camps operating in Russia is paid.  In the Moscow camping "Krylatskoe" parking space costs 1000 rubles.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">per day, in the "Russian settlement" in Valdai - 600 rubles. per day, in other campsites the fee is divided into two components: 700 rubles. - for parking and 300 rubles. - organizational fee, including services for garbage collection and cleaning of the territory. For comparison: in Europe, parking on the campsite will cost from 14 to 20 euros.</font></font><br><br>                   .              .    ,  PR-  ¬´ ¬ª,       .   ,     ‚Äî     ,          ,          . ¬´          -¬ª, ‚Äî  . <br><br> <strong>  </strong> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unlike a solid country house, located on its own plot of land, mobile homes are deprived of a certain place of residence.
