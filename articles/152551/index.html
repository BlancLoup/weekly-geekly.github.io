We know that many habrayusers like games and devote a lot of time to them - both those who can afford to work remotely or freelance, and those who have free time during the working day at the office. <br><br>  Taking this opportunity, we want to offer an alternative to variegated fun farms in social networks and faceless BBMMORPG, presenting a browser strategy from our team.  Get acquainted, <a href="http://mlgame.ru/%3Fstate%3Dregister_simple%26ref%3Dhabr"><b>‚ÄúMu Lands: Black Game Hunting‚Äù</b></a> is a winner in the nomination ‚ÄúThe Best Browser Game‚Äù of 2010 and 2011 according to the version of <a href="http://awards.confog.org.ua/">ConfOG</a> and a game in which you can exchange virtual pearls for real money.  Especially for Habr, one of our players wrote a review - his own view of the game, which we present to you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dca/423/bb6/dca423bb69999fb44d7828aa8a56c8cb.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once upon a time, in a distant, distant galaxy, in one kingdom, there were four races - good and nice <b>Knights</b> and <b>Elves</b> , and a few less good and cute <b>Demons</b> and <b>Dark Elves</b> .  They lived, however, in love and harmony, ate butterflies and popped a rainbow, embraced in every way and built a bright future.  Exactly to the very moment when some scum did not spoil everything by discovering the local oil-gas - <b>Black Pearl</b> .  Quickly realizing that the new resource is not only beautiful jewels but also the <b>Source of Unprecedented Power, the</b> Empire promptly divided into two factions on the basis of whiteness and fluffiness, each of which began active attempts to crush all the deposits of ChZ, as the players called it for short, without disdaining in this case, if necessary, tangle the allies, albeit with penalties.  However, it is worth it, because you can buy all sorts of premium bonuses for this resource, pay for a subscription and, most importantly, convert it into real currency, and what a respected Dark Elf will refuse to change a thousand or two pearls for a couple of hundred evergreen bills, even on WebMoney a little bag  In general, everything is like in real life, just a little more fighting and about elves.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/342/dd9/7ef/342dd97ef21e81468d886ac636ad739d.jpg"><br><br>  It is against this background that the player has never worn a string and will have to begin to establish dominance over the surrounding reality.  However, the plot in this game is a purely secondary matter, a very pleasant graphical performance, subtly reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic II, and the gameplay itself are of much greater interest.  After a short <a href="http://mlgame.ru/%3Fstate%3Dregister_simple%26ref%3Dhabr">registration, the</a> player is asked to choose one of 17 currently existing servers of three types - ‚ÄúThe Dawn of Civilization‚Äù, which focuses on economic development, the ‚ÄúBattle of the Titans‚Äù, designed for active hostilities and the ‚ÄúWar of Factions‚Äù, which, unlike The first two have a lifespan - either until the destruction of the Citadel of Evil, or after four months of real time.  The latter, however, is available only to experienced players who have completed a special line of quests on a mining or combat server. <br><br>  After choosing the habitat, the player is invited to join one of the four races sounded above, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages, as well as the native type of land, which also has positive and negative sides. For example, <b>Demons are</b> faster than others to mine a stone, and their mercenaries have the highest rate of attack, and the <b>Dead Earth</b> , on which the horned begin their power, are completely unsuitable for the extraction of forests and grasses, but to dig a stone on them is a pleasure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e44/f5d/36a/e44f5d36afcbde05b3b21589b59e2e76.jpg"><br><br>  Upon completion of manipulations with the choice of race, the player enters the capital management screen - his first and so far only city, representing a hexagonal field, the number of cells of which depends on the level of the <b>City Hall</b> , one of the two buildings initially available in the city.  The second is the <b>Gate</b> , which - lo and behold - behave like the most ordinary gate, in an open state (to which it is necessary to live - for the initial opening with the solemn cutting of the red ribbon, it is necessary to study the corresponding science, which is far from the beginning of the research tree) to perform combat missions, send workers to slaughter in the villages, explore the territory, establish new cities, in a word, do everything that requires the creatures to leave the city walls.  However, as with any gate, there are two sides.  If you can get out of the city, then you can enter the city, and not only well-wishers.  Simply put, in this state, a player‚Äôs abode can be made a daring attack, if the battle for which the city is lost, is lost, but some resources will be stolen, and part of the civilian population will be enslaved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cf9/d1c/50c/cf9d1c50c6dd0e6386c69812a286d742.jpg"><br><br>  The gameplay itself is quite standard for this type of games - the player in every way equips his possessions, builds and improves buildings, which are divided into five types: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Mining</b> - all sorts of mills and quarries, extracting the main resources - <b>gold, wood, stone, cereals</b> and <b>iron</b> .  Incidentally, these include alchemists' laboratories, which produce <b>units of science</b> - the greater their quantity and quality, the faster research is conducted. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Municipal</b> houses, which include various types of dwellings for the <b>population</b> , resource warehouses, a tavern for hiring <b>heroes</b> - one of the last major innovations in the game, which made a significant change in the gameplay, as well as all kinds of temples with dungeons. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Combat</b> , in which the army of the player trains, eight types of different units, each with its own abilities and the scheme of interaction with other types of troops. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Special</b> - these buildings are used to hire all sorts of non-combat creatures - the explorers of the territories, the colonialists who found new cities, the guilds of spies and anti-spies. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Protective</b> - in this tab there are only three buildings - fortifications and two types of towers, simple and magic, which significantly help in protecting the city from the encroachments of enemy armies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d25/526/3c9/d255263c9198decd0c25bd716745ba6a.jpg"><br><br>  Initially, only a small part of the buildings is available for construction - for the construction of the rest it is required to carry out the relevant research.  The tree of science in the game is extremely voluminous and branchy, so it is necessary to approach the sequence of research, which often takes quite a long time, with particular care.  Also, it is not at all superfluous to engage in the formation of alliances and attend to the search for clans: the support of other players is an extremely important and valuable thing, but more on that next time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/095/583/3ef/0955833ef6dcfe79197984c36d26c637.jpg"><br><br>  After the player has sufficiently developed the capital, has equipped it with settlements and opened the gates, you can begin to expand their areas of influence: searching, arranging and protecting from the encroachments of opponents of external possessions - mines, adits and gold veins, where the resource extraction rate is much higher rather than in cities, founding new cities, finding ruins and salt lakes, which is perhaps the main task - after all, the last two types of locations bring the same <b>black pearls</b> .  To obtain the treasured jewels from the first, it is necessary to raid ancient ruins and show the monsters guarding the <b>ruins</b> , whose dignity is longer and thicker.  <b>The salt lake</b> works like any other external possession - it brings a stable amount of black pearls in a certain period of time.  Another way (except, of course, the purchase of black pearls for real currency), the extraction of the treasured resource is an auction, where lots of gold with the sale of PCs regularly appear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bae/fad/634/baefad634a16dd3ca9f5e88add84242f.png"><br><br>  Now about the most interesting - the possibility of displaying game currency in real currency.  After registration, the player is given a promotional period, during which he decides for himself whether he wants to play for free, but without the possibility of withdrawing funds, or pay a subscription (including black pearls earned in the game) and play with a premium account, which provides quite convenient additional features such as creating a queue of research and construction of buildings and, most importantly, the ability to display game currency in real.  Subsequently, the subscription can be stopped to pay and go to a free game scheme, but the transition from free mode to premium is not possible - the decision must be made immediately after the promotional period, otherwise you will have to start all over again.  The withdrawal scheme is quite simple, Black Pearl from an account on a particular server is converted into a common internal currency <b>ML $</b> (that is, you can play on different servers in parallel and withdraw accumulated BJ to a common in-game account), and already <b>ML $ is</b> transferred to a WMZ wallet from 5% commission. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d7d/4e1/2a5/d7d4e12a5158084076731208dfc1f0eb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a0/2f3/edb/2a02f3edbd9810adcd884a9756f69af0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4de/189/6a2/4de1896a228a9f3fa28de336c91a9293.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e0/e4e/639/6e0e4e6391dfc0c3bc120283e26f85ac.jpg"><br><br>  In our next posts, we plan to talk about how games are being developed and promoted, as well as to describe My Lands in more detail, and to describe the expenses and incomes that arise in the process of passing. <br><br>  However, rejecting the financial issue aside, one can say that even in the free mode of the game <a href="http://mlgame.ru/%3Fstate%3Dregister_simple%26ref%3Dhabr">MyLands</a> is a very pleasant pastime that can be practiced without interrupting the work process. <br><br>  See you in the kingdom! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152551/</a></p>
