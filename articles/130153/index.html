  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social apps - now on mobile devices</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>When analyzing the functionality of the long-awaited Facebook application for the iPad, it is easy to miss the more important innovation - the expansion to the mobile versions of Facebook of the opportunities that the Facebook Platform provides to the developers.</i>  <i>Here is a review of these innovations:</i> <br><br>  Today, the Facebook Platform has been extended to mobile versions of Facebook, which means accessibility for mobile sites and applications of all those channels that have already helped apps and games to ‚Äúreach out‚Äù to hundreds of millions of users on the web.  As a developer, you can offer your application to 350 million people who use Facebook every month on mobile devices, including the iPad, iPhone, iPod touch and the mobile version of our site. <br>  We are starting to deploy applications under the Facebook Platform to mobile devices.  These features are still under development.  They will change as we learn more about how to make the most of mobile devices to communicate on the network.  In addition, in the near future, we will extend native support to other mobile platforms, such as Android.  We are interested in seeing which applications you will create using these functions and we are ready to work with you to improve them. <br><br><h5>  Social channels on mobile devices </h5><br>  <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/channels/">Social channels</a> such as bookmarks, invitations, and news <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/channels/">feeds</a> play a leading role in how people discover applications, and how applications are spread through the Facebook Platform.  Until now, these channels have been available only to Facebook sites and applications in the ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù version of Facebook.  Below we describe the main changes that we have implemented to make social channels available on mobile devices. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  Bookmarks </h5><br>  <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile/">Bookmarks</a> are one of the key mechanisms for re-engaging users on Facebook.  When a user contacts your application, a bookmark is automatically added to the navigation bar on Facebook. <br>  Now people who use Facebook on the iPhone or iPad, as well as the mobile version of the site ( <a href="http://m.facebook.com/">m.facebook.com</a> ), will see bookmarks leading to mobile versions of these applications.  When a user clicks on the bookmark icon in our application on an iPhone or iPad, either the corresponding iOS application will start (if it is already installed) or the user is redirected to the App Store.  Bookmarks on the mobile site will lead to the mobile web version of your application. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/93b/4ce/cf5/93b4cecf57bc6ad9849a4a75b0a80386.png" alt="image"><br><h5>  Invitations </h5><br>  <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile/">A new invitation dialogue</a> in the mobile version allows users to invite their friends to the application.  Friends will be able to receive an invitation to any of the platforms where this application is supported.  For example, if a user plays your game on Facebook.com, his friends will be able to answer his request from his iPhone.  As in the case of bookmarks, users will click directly on the invitation to the mobile version of your application, be it an iOS version or a mobile web version. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/643/b73/399/643b733995c274cbb8e9742784207f0c.png" alt="image"><br><h5>  news feed </h5><br>  It was possible to use the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile/">news feed dialog</a> so that applications could publish messages about some important events, however, until this point, users could not interact with these messages in the feed on their mobile devices.  Now, having seen some interesting message from some application in my tape, you can click on it and get directly to the mobile version of this application, be it an iOS version or a mobile web version. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bea/45f/c46/bea45fc46e9d9b62873ec2b7d4c0710a.png" alt="image"><br><h5>  Authenticated Links </h5><br>  <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/beta/authentication/">Authenticated links is</a> a new feature that provides authentication of all traffic from Facebook to your application.  When users search and find a new application, or click on a link in the news feed, or respond to an invitation from a mobile application that they have not used before, they will be asked to log in (log in) to Facebook before going to the application.  This will give developers the opportunity to provide users with the most personalized approach from the very beginning of working with the application. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b7/66c/67e/1b766c67e76bf5d7a078d16f37b1ead8.png" alt="image"><br><h5>  Facebook Credits </h5><br>  Also today, we are spreading support for <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/creditsapi/">Facebook Credits</a> to mobile apps.  Facebook Credits is a payment system that gives users a safe and easy way to pay for virtual and ‚Äúdigital‚Äù purchases.  Mobile applications are subject to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/policy/credits/">the same rules</a> as Facebook applications, including the requirement to use Facebook Credits as the only payment mechanism.  Facebook Credits are not allowed for iOS applications or mobile web applications running inside a Facebook application on iOS. <br><br><h5>  Where to begin </h5><br>  Of the 350 million people accessing Facebook every month from mobile devices, about half use the web version and half use apps for various mobile operating systems.  Social apps are primarily a way to communicate with your friends, and the best of them are those that have both iOS and a web version, so we recommend that you think about how to ensure the most complete coverage of your Facebook audience with both versions. <br>  If you already have an iOS application, the integration will be very simple - you just need to implement Single Sign-On using our <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile/ios/">iOS SDK</a> .  If you are creating a mobile web application, you can use the HTML5 features to create an application that works on all modern devices, as well as implement additional functions using technologies such as PhoneGap.  Check out our <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile/">documentation for mobile developers</a> to learn more. <br>  We worked closely with a number of leading developers to create cool mobile web applications and this is just the beginning.  Already today you can try the Audiovroom, Branchout, Flixster, Gilt Groupe and Huffington Post apps, as well as games from EA, Moblyng, Storm8, Wooga and Zynga.  You can try these applications by clicking <a href="http://fb.me/mobileappshowcase">fb.me/mobileappshowcase</a> from your phone or tablet.  Most of them are built on HTML5, which provides them with the same functionality on iOS, Android and other mobile platforms. <br>  And on October 28, we will hold a Mobile Hack conference in Silicon Valley so that developers can learn more about these new features and create super applications.  Register for the conference <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform%3Fformkey%3DdGYtRl9XWGczQlV0Vm95S1c4QkFSaXc6MQ%26ifq%26ndplr%3D1">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130153/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130153/</a></p>
