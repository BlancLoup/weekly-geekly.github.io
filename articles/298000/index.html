  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The body that works as a programmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is my third attempt to write about the programmer as a person.  A person who lives in an artificial environment and is engaged in a well-defined activity most of his time.  In this article I will turn to such authority in body-oriented psychology (TOP) as A. Lowen.  He considers the psyche and the body as a whole, and, more precisely, this very division, in his opinion, is absurd.  The psyche is a projection of the body, just as the body reflects the psyche.  So, for example, if a person has a chronically tense head, then A. Lowen, following V. Reich, calls it a ‚Äúneurotic head‚Äù, and, most likely, this tension entails a disturbance in the emotional sphere.  The reverse effect - depression affects the overall tone of the person. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In my opinion in the IT field, there is an obvious pattern (set of actions) for resolving psychological problems (collectively called prokastination).  This article will show you an alternative way to solve your own problems. <br><br>  In the case of a ‚Äúneurasthenic cap,‚Äù for example, it is harmful to force yourself to work, this leads, at best, to crowding out problems and chronic fatigue at the very beginning of the day, at worst, usually to a change in character towards irritability, reticence, unwillingness to take on new tasks (that would somehow unload the head). <br><br>  There are seven such ‚Äúbelts‚Äù of the body V. Reich:

      Frontal part (‚Äúcap of neurasthenic‚Äù) <br>  Maxillary clamp - unexpressed, understated, squeezed aggression. <br>  The neck is all that is associated with self-identification. <br>  Chest belt - feelings <br>  The diaphragm zone is the border of awareness of emotion. <br>  Umbilical zone - feelings associated with pleasure, fear <br>  The pelvic area is sexuality. <br><br>  Pay attention to who is sitting.  If he is hunched, then, most likely, the person unconsciously blocks his emotions, since this will disturb the movement of the diaphragm and, in principle, breathing.  What is the position of the neck, is this position comfortable for it?  In the neck are all the blood vessels for the head, and due to the fact that it has few nerve endings, it seems that everything is in order.  But many of my friends IT people took pills to improve their blood supply. <br><br>  Sometimes it seems (and sometimes it is) that the employer assesses your work according to whether you are at your workplace or not, and I saw a person prone to walking while thinking (legs are a natural pump of the blood supply), whatever he might have been mistaken for a parasite. <br><br>  As for the example of ‚Äúwho sits like me‚Äù, it will be objected that it is impossible to sit with a constantly straightened back so much time, and I will agree.  And add that to sit 8 hours a day, our body is not fit at all. <br><br>  Often, body-oriented therapy refers to yoga, physical education, gym, and sport in any form.  This is not true.  But they also greatly contribute to the coming to a fuller living of life.  A. Lowen writes that the purpose of his therapy is not some kind of spiritual experience or super-experience, but ordinary life. <br><br>  To begin with, let us introduce a certain criterion of how a healthy person feels according to A.Lowen and V.Rayhu.  And for this criterion, we take the way a person is going through an orgasm.  I will reveal this topic a little differently in the original form of the article (it is under the cut at the very bottom).  They say that orgasm is accompanied by involuntary, uncontrolled movements.  It is also noted that in the process of therapy, an increase in the freedom of movement, expression, and emotional maturity is observed. <br><br>  Why do you need to pay attention to this?  Often, protective reactions that are produced in childhood are remembered by the body.  And in order to return to this state, it is enough to take the same position.  So, for example, a father's cuff, in front of which the child strained at the back of the head, and then caused an offense and a sense of injustice, may affect the state during work.  For example, it got colder (they turned on the air conditioner), the person naturally tensed his neck and occipital region, which, in turn, caused these emotions, and since they don‚Äôt have a place in this situation, he ousted them.  Bad mood secured.  During the independent exercise, you can remove these ‚Äúclips‚Äù.  I'm not talking about relationships with children (which, by definition, ‚Äúwalking emotion‚Äù) or the opposite sex. <br><br>  From the point of view of TOP, any rigid (rigid) construction is harmful for psychological health.  We do not have rigid crossbars for such structures, all these schemes are performed by the same material as everything else. <br><br>  Exercises from the TOP are not done more than 15 minutes a day.  This, of course, is not ‚Äúput the mouse in the other hand,‚Äù but a real way to feel yourself. <br><br>  There is much more to be said about the body-oriented approach to myself, but I have no task to retell everything.  I just want to draw your attention to your own state and, perhaps, to interest such a direction in psychology as TOP. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The article is more trolling, but with practice ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This article rather excursus_explains includes experiments that will show you a certain state of "animal principle", which is not accepted to be guided by during the working time.  (There will be - seed and experiments, excluding theory). <br><br>  I devoted my first articles to Jung's psychoanalysis, and tried to show in them how each type (according to Jung's typology) feels like being a programmer, to show that this sphere is more than logical-intuitive, which entails a number of professional deformations.  And also the fact that according to the theory of K.G.  Jung's logic excludes feelings, and intuition - sensory perception. <br><br>  And to the factor that when failing to solve a problem by known methods, it is natural to experience stress (and for long failures - frustration), I will dedicate only this paragraph.  In other words, if the known patterns of behavior do not work, we get annoyed. <br><br>  The text below is an excerpt from the book ‚ÄúLove and Orgasm‚Äù by A. Lowen.  You can disagree with him (and with me), however, remember that these thoughts are confirmed by many years of practice in body-oriented psychology. <br>  To begin with, we introduce a certain criterion of how a healthy person feels according to A. Lowen and V. Reich.  And for this criterion, we take the way a person is going through an orgasm. <br><blockquote>  <i>During the orgasmic climax, self-consciousness disappears (ego-</i> <i><br></i>  <i>consciousness).</i>  <i>This temporary blackout of the "Ego" is not overshadowed by the feeling</i> <i><br></i>  <i>abandonment.</i>  <i>We do not lose consciousness in the process of orgasm.</i>  <i>It would be more correct</i> <i><br></i>  <i>talk about the loss of personal self.</i>  <i>I (self) disappears, dissolving into</i> <i><br></i>  <i>love object: love reaches its ultimate goal.</i>  <i>Here arises not</i> <i><br></i>  <i>only a feeling of complete unity and unification with a partner, but also appears</i> <i><br></i>  <i>consciousness of oneself as part of a single pulsating universe.</i>  <i>Last thought</i> <i><br></i>  <i>confirms the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãReich that in an orgasm a man realizes himself as one</i> <i><br></i>  <i>whole with cosmic processes.</i> </blockquote><br>  It is worth noting that this is not a unique experience, but the norm.  The norm to which A. Loewen led his patients for six months.  To prove my words, I cite an excerpt from one patient‚Äôs review: <br><blockquote>  <i>Next, we give what one woman told who survived this</i> <i><br></i>  <i>phenomenon;</i>  <i>her description is short and precise: ‚ÄúOnce upon a time</i> <i><br></i>  <i>intercourse I experienced something so different from everything else that I</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I thought that I could never again feel satisfaction while it</i> <i><br></i>  <i>did not happen to me again.</i>  <i>During this experience, without any</i> <i><br></i>  <i>of effort and effort on my part, my body seemed to be moving from the inside, and all</i> <i><br></i>  <i>was wonderful.</i>  <i>There was a rhythm and a feeling of ecstasy from the realization that I was part</i> <i><br></i>  <i>something much bigger than myself, and finally a reward in the form</i> <i><br></i>  <i>real satisfaction and peace. "</i> </blockquote><br>  Those who expect that further there will be a text aimed at improving its effectiveness as a programmer can close it.  I will give a description of what are self-deception and problems, according to A. Lowen.  There is no direct connection between programming and these problems.  )) <br><blockquote>  <i>The most common sexual disorder in men is premature ejaculation.</i>  <i>As usual, no precise guidance on this.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>about nowhere, because no one has defined what it is</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"Premature" and what should be the "normal" duration</i> <i><br></i>  <i>process.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Alfred Kinsey states: "Probably three quarters of all men</i> <i><br></i>  <i>an orgasm develops two minutes after the start of sexual intercourse, and some</i> <i><br></i>  <i>can survive the climax in less than a minute or even ten</i> <i><br></i>  <i>or twenty seconds after coital penetration. ‚Äù</i>  <i>I can confirm</i> <i><br></i>  <i>that a third of the men I had to treat suffered from it</i> <i><br></i>  <i>frustration.</i>  <i>Its effect goes beyond the male deficiency.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>satisfaction.</i>  <i>In severe cases, premature ejaculation deprives</i> <i><br></i>  <i>woman's ability to achieve a vaginal orgasm, even if she is capable</i> <i><br></i>  <i>experience it.</i>  <i>The overall result is manifested in the form of incomplete sexual</i> <i><br></i>  <i>relationship for both partners leads to tensions in their relationship and</i> <i><br></i>  <i>often leads to dissolution of marriage.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It should now be clarified why many premature sufferers</i> <i><br></i>  <i>ejaculation, not aware of it.</i> </blockquote><br>  Another ... <br><blockquote>  <i>Another form of orgasmic impotence in men is known as technical</i> <i><br></i>  <i>called "inhibited ejaculation" (ejaculatio retardans).</i>  <i>In this case</i> <i><br></i>  <i>ejaculation is restrained or does not occur until excitement subsides.</i>  <i>AT</i> <i><br></i>  <i>As a result, of course, there comes a very weak climax, which does not bring</i> <i><br></i>  <i>feelings of orgasmic satisfaction.</i>  <i>Compared to this violation, with</i> <i><br></i>  <i>which often has a sense of climax absent, premature</i> <i><br></i>  <i>ejaculation may seem the pinnacle of excitement.</i> </blockquote><br>  3 form of discharge according to A. Lowen: <br><blockquote>  <i>Ejaculation is not premature and not inhibited, it happens</i> <i><br></i>  <i>just at the moment of the onset of involuntary movements.</i>  <i>Full sense</i> <i><br></i>  <i>satisfaction eludes a man because his body is not entirely</i> <i><br></i>  <i>included in the sexual response.</i>  <i>He is motionless.</i>  <i>However, what feels like</i> <i><br></i>  <i>while experiencing a higher moment of excitement, it is pleasant, and for this</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The reason is that such a reaction is usually not considered a deviation.</i>  <i>WITH</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In terms of orgasmic potency, this should be considered as</i> <i><br></i>  <i>partial orgasm.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>This is the local ....</i> </blockquote><br>  Yes, I can be blamed for the fact that this is a problem not only for programmers, but also for workers in any other fields (and will be right).  To this I will object to the fact that it is the programmers who have a worsening of the emotional state when, after rehabilitation and recovery, they start programming again (without a passion associated with a movement or other activity).  Further I suggest you to read the book of A. Lowen (mentioned above), which is written in simple language and will be understandable even to an unprepared person. <br><br>  It should be noted that there are very few qualitative studies of the impact on a person of this kind of activity (or rather, I found only one).  And all my thoughts are based on my own observations. <br><br>  <b>Practice.</b> <br>  As an experiment, I suggest that you do the following exercise, which is called ‚Äúbasic grounding‚Äù: <br><blockquote>  <i>Stand with your feet apart at a distance of about 25 centimeters and turning the toes inward so as to slightly pull the gluteus muscles.</i>  <i>Bend forward and touch the floor with the fingers of both hands.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Knees slightly bent.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>All body weight should fall on the foot, do not carry it on your hands.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Relax your neck as much as possible, allow your head to hang loose.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Breathe your mouth freely and deeply.</i>  <i>Watch your breathing carefully.</i>  <i>For the time of the experiment, forget about breathing through the nose.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Let your body weight "flow" forward so that it falls on the front of the feet.</i>  <i>Heels can barely lift off the floor, but only slightly.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Gently straighten your legs until your hamstrings stretch.</i>  <i>The legs, however, should not be straightened out completely, and should not be blocked.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Hold this position for about a minute.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Now ask yourself the following questions:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ Do you breathe freely or does something interfere with your breathing?</i>  <i>If breathing is restrained, vibrations will not occur.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ Do you feel vibrating activity in your legs?</i>  <i>If not, try to bend your knees slightly, and then straighten them, taking the starting position.</i>  <i>Repeat this action to allow the leg muscles to relax.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ What is the nature of the vibrations?</i>  <i>Are they weak or strong, uniform or impetuous?</i>  <i>In some cases, people literally bounce, unable to contain arousal.</i>  <i>Has this happened to you?</i>  <i>We will suggest doing this experience again when you read the next chapter.</i> </blockquote><br>  In the process of this exercise, you can feel how pleasant it is for you to come in contact with the lower part of your body, with the part that contains the instincts.  Most of your emotions are there.  Here is what Lowen writes in this book, ‚ÄúA Collection of Bioenergy Experiments,‚Äù about this exercise: <br><blockquote>  <i>Most westerners are centered in the upper body, mostly in the head.</i>  <i>We perceive the head as the ‚Äúreceptacle‚Äù of the ego, the center of consciousness and deliberate behavior.</i>  <i>The lower, or pelvic, center, where the hara is located, on the contrary, is considered the center of unconscious and instinctive behavior.</i>  <i>It can be said that this is the animal center (as Todd suggests).</i>  <i>The significance of this center becomes obvious if we remember that only 10% of our movements are conscious, while 90% are unconscious.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>An analogy will make this more understandable.</i>  <i>Imagine a horse and a rider.</i>  <i>The rider - the ego - deliberately gives instructions and controls the speed;</i>  <i>the horse - the lower center - is strong and ready to deliver the rider wherever he wants.</i>  <i>If the rider (ego) suddenly loses the ability to act consciously, the horse (lower center) will most likely still take him home unharmed.</i>  <i>But if the horse falls, the rider will be virtually helpless.</i> </blockquote><br>  Daily ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù and ‚Äúarching‚Äù can significantly reduce the level of tension in the body. <br><blockquote>  <i>"Arch"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>This experience is similar to the previous one.</i>  <i>The difference is that it causes the body, under the influence of stress, to open its breath and load its legs more.</i>  <i>Its correct implementation helps to get rid of the tension in the stomach, which is exactly what creates the "belly".</i>  <i>The same exercise is performed by those practicing Tai Chi.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Stand with your feet apart at a distance of about 50 centimeters, slightly turning the toes of the legs inward.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Now press your fists in the lower back so that the knuckles of your thumbs are turned upwards.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Without lifting the heels from the floor, bend both knees as far as you can.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Reach back, not removing fists from the waist, but as if on top of them.</i>  <i>Be sure to ensure that the weight remains shifted forward and falls on the front of the foot.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Breathe deeply while exercising your belly.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ Do you feel some ‚Äútightness‚Äù in your lower back?</i>  <i>If so, this means that there is a very significant tension in this part of the body.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ Does pain or tension feel in the base of the hips or around the knees?</i>  <i>If your legs are relaxed, you will not feel tight anywhere except for your ankles and feet, which hold your body weight.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ Do your feet begin to vibrate?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ Is it possible to maintain the maximum curved position?</i>  <i>Backward or forward pop?</i>  <i>In both cases, you have broken the arch of the arch, and energy and feelings cannot flow unhindered into the feet.</i> </blockquote><br>  With this, I will end a small excursion into the practice of A. Lowen.  All exercises of bioenergy practice are very simple, and you can find them in any of the books on body-oriented psychology (TOP).  More extensively writing about the TOP in this article is harmful, since it is better to read the original.  From the experience of previous articles, I understand that this article will meet a lot of negative feedback (this is not a habr format, ‚Äúyes, we are not such‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat have programmers‚Äù), however, it seems to me that it is important for everyone to pay attention to their psycho-emotional state , and even more so - for programmers. <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298000/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298000/</a></p>
