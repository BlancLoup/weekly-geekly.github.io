  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Freelance. 10 problems when working with customers. Part 1.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In response to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/pm/27099.html">habrahabr.ru/blog/pm/27099.html</a> I want to give a look at the situation from a freelancer. <br><br>  Over the years working with customers, I have accumulated a small ‚Äúcart‚Äù of problems when working in freelancing.  It's time to systematize this knowledge a little.  Let's get started <br><br>  <strong>Problem 1. Lack of technical specifications.</strong> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, 99% of customers have no technical requirements at all.  Therefore, it makes the realization of the final product difficult, and generally speaking, it makes it practically impossible to achieve any originally planned result for the simple reason that in words a client may want one thing, and as a result, either another or a lot of problems will turn out. <br><br>  The fact that the technical specification is missing is a major headache for the implementer, because there is no way you can later prove that what was needed was exactly what was done. <br><br>  <em>Solution methods:</em> <br><blockquote>  offer to write a technical task as a separate service and put it into the project budget </blockquote><br><blockquote>  ask the client to return when he has a technical assignment </blockquote><br><blockquote>  suggest to describe, more or less formally, in textual form, what is nevertheless required (This is an order of magnitude better than if the task is formulated only orally). </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Problem 2. Problems with finances.</strong> <br><br>  The main part of customers for this day in freelancing - individuals.  This is a limiting factor in terms of payments - very often the budget of an individual customer is lower than if you did it for a company.  And firms have their problems with freelancers - they almost don‚Äôt rotate cash, and a freelancer can only accept payment by bank transfer if it is registered as a private entrepreneur.  Therefore, in terms of budgets - there are some limiting factors.  Fortunately - the situation is changing for the better - those physical persons who previously entered the market have invested some part of their finances - and now they are earning from their own projects, which makes it possible to attract more finance to develop new, refine / improve old projects. <br><br>  <em>Solution methods:</em> <br><blockquote>  Register yourself as a private entrepreneur.  But not every company has yet to contact a private entrepreneur - there are nuances with payment. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Search for "spun" individuals, offering them their services. </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Problem 3. Unwillingness to pay a prepayment.</strong> <br><br>  By the way, it will be said - without prepayment you shouldn‚Äôt work with any client at all.  Is that only at the beginning of the freelance path.  Or perform a small piece of work on the project (during, for example, an hour) to show that you are able to the customer (as an alternative - a test task). <br><br>  Customers do not wish to pay an advance payment for several reasons: <br><br>  a) do not want to lose time and money <br>  b) this customer is scam and wants to get a finished job and not pay anything <br><br>  <em>Solution methods:</em> <br><blockquote>  You can offer to use the service of third-party services for a secure transaction. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  if the customer does not want to pay due to b) (checked by ‚Äúat random‚Äù) - do not work with such a customer. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  to become a trusted freelancer with a lot of positive reviews and satisfied customers - then the risk for a customer to lose time and money is&gt; 0. An honest freelancer who values ‚Äã‚Äãreputation will never throw a single customer, crossing out this year of work for reputation. <br></blockquote><br>  <strong>Problem 4. Communication.</strong> <br><br>  It is very difficult to communicate with a certain number of clients - it is difficult to find a common language - for example, they do not write correctly, are not clearly expressed, are overly emotional, and sometimes the freelancer is not at all respected, considering him almost his servant if he is paid some amount of money. <br><br>  <em>Solution methods:</em> <br><blockquote>  to try to avoid such customers - in my experience - doesn‚Äôt shine with such people in the end. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  take a manager and transfer communication with the client on his shoulders. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  work only with increased pay for work (to compensate for problems in communication). </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Problem 5. Distrust.</strong> <br><br>  Clients do not trust anyone.  Even to themselves.  This is amazing - but true.  Although most of them calm down after the first stages of work - a certain percentage do not trust to the very end - what they are looking for is a trick - slips into any of their phrases, in any letter, which significantly complicates the work with such a client. <br><br>  <em>Solution methods:</em> <br><blockquote>  Show the client that you are a professional.  Do everything by 5+ and even more than was required on the instructions. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Trying to negate negativity with the help of communication - find a common language, common themes, try to endear a person emotionally. </blockquote><br><br>  To be continued. <br><br>  The original is <a href="http://malkin.com.ua/2007/09/04/freelance-10-problem-pri-rabote-s-zakazchikami-chast-1/">here.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14887/</a></p>
