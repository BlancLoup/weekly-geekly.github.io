Innoprom is such an all-Russian industrial exhibition, which is held annually in Yekaterinburg.  This year, the exhibition was devoted to intellectual technologies, all kinds of robots and automation systems. <br><br>  Then, in 2013, the exhibition was remembered by several worthy exhibits, including the humanoid robot from Android technology and FlyKit, a company engaged in aerial photography from multicopter.  Exactly one year passed, and we were able to participate in this large-scale event with our own booth!  I will briefly tell you about the experience of participation and the projects we have presented in this photo article. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  What did we have on the stand </h4><br>  First, of course there were 3D printers.  Due to the fact that in our hackspace the concentration of these machines is several times higher than the average in the city, we were given a 9 square meter stand for free.  And the organizers of the industrial design forum, which taxied the 1st pavilion of the exhibition, did this good deed, for which they are very grateful. <br><br>  So, I needed a trouble-free printer.  For these purposes, we chose Chinese Duplicator 3. We take it to all the seminars and master classes on 3D printing, and it prints and prints like a clock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed3/de7/674/ed3de7674428dae6e0500f9b8298ec60.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, at the exhibition we mainly printed such cats here :) This is a three-dimensional copy of a cat with our certificates for 3D printing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/898/2db/385/8982db385b28a98e35f8473e7b175637.jpg"><br><br>  Further, I wanted to show that our hackspace did something like this in the field of 3D printing.  Especially for the exhibition, we have assembled a new printer, with an atypical positioning system.  In fact, they moved the step for the X axis from the moving carriage to the body.  As always, everything was done on the last day, so that the working prototype of the machine was installed on the stand only by the beginning of the second day :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f07/fb1/921/f07fb19217872da6d8e156eb179ca590.jpg"><br><br>  But the chocolate printer for the time since the winter 3D-Expo has practically not undergone any major changes.  Replaced only electronics.  We drew chocolate on paper with text and strange patterns, to the delight of visitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/841/c30/9aa/841c309aa7a9d5544515c1764db40c2d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Educational robotics is another area in which we have been actively working throughout the last year.  At the stand, we placed our omnipresent blue walking robot and the new model of multiplo-compatible robot MR-K-2.  The latter is the second version of the mobile robot, for which we are doing courses on robotclass.ru.  About this our venture, I will write later in a separate article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76d/426/b08/76d426b08ed6ab2c7dfaeba798d71137.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/760/841/2f4/7608412f44b338fd32970ffd09841ecb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And of course, we brought our Karel (aka Fritz) to the exhibition, who closely followed his future victims to the exhibition visitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/838/faf/864/838faf8642b606756dee82b8812887bd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, Fritz became a member of a significant event.  One of the curious visitors expressed interest about our 3D printers, and casually said that a little engaged in machine vision.  In response to my phrase, that we are also engaged in machine vision.  For example, we use the popular OpenCV package.  The man modestly said that he created OpenCV.  It was Gary Bradski - President and CEO of the OpenCV Foundation.  Photograph: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fa/ec6/b5c/3faec6b5c8ddbd777aeebc8d84f9c712.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We exchanged mail, we will cooperate :) Very cool acquaintance for our hackspace. <br><br>  But these legs were brought to us by their creator and our colleague Dmitry Popov!  It is seen that the entire structure is printed on a 3D printer.  In the nodes of the legs are robo-serva with a moment of 18kg / cm.  The next step is to attach at least some basin and make them walk.  That is, 1% of all the work has been done so far, but the author is determined :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce4/d60/395/ce4d6039574f8af1123d0cf0ef89cdd2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b1/1a7/57b/3b11a757b5e3878c9684c5fa70eda702.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another creation of Dmitry - hexapod.  I will not call him a spider, for two more legs are missing.  Stuck turned out very high quality.  At hand was only duralumin 2mm, and a milling cutter, so that the body turned out with excessive strength, but you can at least send to battle.  In addition to the robot itself, Dmitry has developed a glamorous control interface for a tablet with a touchscreen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff7/afa/e1b/ff7afae1bc0e904c8f9e7510fd0356e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  More printers </h4><br>  Our 3D printer (again Chinese, but already Malyan) was on the UBRD bank stand.  Printed two-color logos surrounded by charming beauties :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/069/966/c1d/069966c1d800b07f24390210effe2684.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Printers were also seen at the Sberbank stand.  Also printed logos :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e4/23b/fa8/1e423bfa8f33fc25150d379db8aac048.jpg"><br><br>  Ural Federal University did not stand aside.  They showed at the exhibition two printers: regular FDM and gypsum polymer.  The latter, by the way, is commanded by another of our colleagues Yuri Avraamov, director of the center for prototyping and prototyping UrFU (in the second photo). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/756/aad/24e/756aad24ed12dfca2c067762c443bee9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc0/929/6a0/cc09296a0cdb4fb6e3cdbc924b1b233e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What other robots and automata were at the exhibition </h4><br>  Right next to our booth lived tracked robots, on which the authors rode periodically :) (see video at the end of the article) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/720/22b/0c3/72022b0c3b8b4817dcfeb7b8b0e0e632.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/836/d62/179/836d6217915d6f693c6497e36b12aa93.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4e/6e4/09d/c4e6e409d7c1ab9a0bd155f0306b044b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a49/a2a/644/a49a2a6443bb51ff8a18d2f91d505189.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One even talked to visitors with the eerie accent of the Shelezak planet.  Around him, the whole exhibition was crowded with people, trying to get an answer out of it to the main question of life, the universe and all that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca5/29f/085/ca529f085cd2caf5b2437e71ce0590df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There were a number of industrial robots that are constantly present at such exhibitions: Kuka, Fanuc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a03/834/45a/a0383445a58728ba3ef0b506f3dd4c4a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f41/597/373/f41597373b35476ce642aecfb3c5a662.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e73/6c3/6ef/e736c36ef1d0204c986c7079d0130a1f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A couple of multicopters.  Unfortunately, without much innovation, standard components.  In general, we wanted to bring our quadrocopter, but did not have time to pretour it, because the printer took away all the resources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/245/76e/35a/24576e35ac17b2608e811fe84eaaeaf3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1e/d5a/bd0/a1ed5abd0f064ddca9434a923e970fa3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the cluster ‚ÄúRussian Robotics‚Äù, in the third pavilion, EMERCOM robots were seen.  Can extinguish a fire, grab someone with claws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f0/a69/8a7/0f0a698a7e43c4ba426c36174fb3cfa3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8c/995/ed3/c8c995ed36ec73d754b6b1476bb1d9aa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There, in the endless waltz, a vigorous turret circled :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95d/9ac/e0c/95d9ace0c9cb54526abb7cfdd38b8e12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff3/723/972/ff37239726dcf19d694c616fbc2be202.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In different pavilions, here and there, strange robots misinterpreted.  Distributed to people advertising booklets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2e/1e1/e1d/b2e1e1e1d2e6ba64e171fb0d054e41e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There was our old friend android from Magnitogorsk, whom we saw at the last exhibition.  Next to him was another robot that could repeat the movements of the operator in the exoskeleton. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6da/6a3/a22/6da6a3a22bb1d3664e73ca730654846d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Finally, the exhibition had stands at all well-known local schools of robotics.  The robothomes of our Palace of Youth were also presented there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e9/034/4bc/7e90344bc71958ed31a0a78302058591.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc4/b29/733/fc4b297334a69c8c97302fb623152d7c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fac/f5b/d08/facf5bd08df7db5516e8c5708e08b683.jpg"><br><br>  In general, there were a lot of young people, and it pleases.  Children crowded around all the stands, where something was moving and talking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ff/946/278/4ff94627880870b7d6fc0db7394f4cbc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd2/da9/f88/cd2da9f8837177f1bfb4a5a6a2ee56f2.jpg"><br><br>  A small video of what happened around our booth all four days of Innoprom. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bjbYXhy6Qp0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiSeBkSsQ1BQ3bDpuh12YMwS7I74Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In general, the exhibition for us was not in vain.  First, we introduced a lot of people to 3D printing.  I hope soon every literate citizen will know what it is.  Secondly, they met a bunch of interesting people who came to the hackspace right after the Innoprom.  Third, we found potential buyers and investors for our developments.  So we are waiting for another innoprom, new projects from MakeItLab! <br><br>  By the way, as promised, after the innoprom we begin to prepare the next conference on robotics in Yekaterinburg.  Plus, this Sunday we organize collective flights on multicopter and helicopters.  Announcements will be in social networks ( <a href="http://vk.com/makeitlab">VK</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/makeitlab">FB</a> ) and on the <a href="http://makeitlab.ru/">website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230463/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230463/</a></p>
