With all their imperfections, they have a huge plus - cheapness! <br>  I, like a happy father then another 2 - year old child, thought - the perfect toy! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have matured a plan of action: <br>  1. Take a Chinese tablet <br>  2. We write home application that will run at startup and replace the shell. <br>  The application must have bookmarks: <ul><li>  Games </li><li>  Video </li><li>  Books </li><li>  + Parenting section with separate button and password for entry. </li></ul><br>  3. We write our market ... well, you understand :) For games we make categories age / area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge, etc.  Well, he would be together with the library and the video library, but you need to look at the copyright.  The market sounds a bit frightening at first, but in fact it‚Äôs just a regular online store with electronic goods. <br>  4. We write on the tablet an application that will send everyone to our market. <br>  5. We write a basic set of games and give developers interfaces for interacting with our market. <br>  6. Such cute things as purchasing, shipping, branding, sales, service, and so on to infinity. <br><br>  The toy will be good because: <br>  1. The possibilities are very great - new games, updates of old games, books with ‚Äúlive‚Äù illustrations and so on. <br>  2. 7 inch tablet lies well in the hands of a child <br>  3. Due to the fact that the tablets are very inexpensive, the cost of the initial piece of iron can be made very small (I expected approximately 7.5 thousand rubles) <br>  4. Games for children at this age are very simple, which makes them easy to develop; in fact, they can be written right after Hello World <br>  5. Games for children at this age are not dynamic, which drastically reduces the requirements for the speed of iron and its responsiveness, it is extremely rare for the gameplay to need multitouch, although such tablets also appeared. <br>  6. It is much more convenient than a laptop for cartoons and games - the child does not need to deal with the mouse, IT is compact, you can safely play in the queue to the doctor, sitting on a cart in the supermarket and so on, it‚Äôs easier to take a tablet so that you can take a child by walking on a visit or restaurant. <br>  7. This is better than an iPad or a phone with an android because it is a child's toy, which costs a lot less and does not participate in the business processes of the parents, and therefore the child is not afraid to give it up and that's all.  And even if he drops it / comes / drowns it is not a disaster, but simply the breakdown of one of the toys. <br>  8. It is not necessary to convince anyone that the children play with gusto in them on the tablets, the topics jumped on the habr. <br><br>  Now the story. <br>  After thinking it over, I caught fire and immediately bought the most eerie tablet from China, he braked mercilessly.  From the Chinese market I downloaded several games, including Kids connect the dots and Kids and numbers, in addition to this, hammering mice into holes and so on.  My daughter accepted it with enthusiasm and very willingly played with a new toy.  I must say that since such glands almost never fall into the hands of children, there are still very few games for young children.  I‚Äôll also say that I didn‚Äôt show anyone the particular toy, but if the children saw it, they would immediately and very willingly start playing.  In particular, once we were in the queue at the clinic and, despite my reluctance to show the toy in public places, we took it out and started playing just in the numbers - 3 more children immediately gathered near us, much more adults, who also shouted out answers and they poked at the screen and their moms got very excited that my daughter solves simple arithmetic examples a little better.  Of course, this is simply because she didn‚Äôt play for the first time, but even then I had three mothers who hadn‚Äôt heard anything about the tablets and were looking to buy this miracle for their children. <br>  The inhibition of the tablet caused problems only at the stage of launching the application, but it was not childishly slowed down.

      My problem is that I am not a programmer at all, so from the very beginning I was thinking how to put together a team. <br>  Immediately make a reservation that I was afraid to shout loudly about the idea to everyone, because I began to act in detours. <br><br>  He started with two friends, it turned out badly.  We can say that it did not work out.  I think that everything is to blame, and I, too, I beg you not to be offended at me, if that.  Looking ahead - I want to try to call people here, and if they want to join, I will be very, very happy. <br>  We did not have a finished home application or market. <br>  Along the way, I found a tablet maker in China, which we approved, bought a test copy.  An order of magnitude more nimble, able to connect to the TV, without any problems turns the video, lives about 5 hours.  It was before the new year, I think now there will be better tablets. <br><br>  In general, time passed and I decided to implement plan B - make money and assign the task in parts to freelancers.  But while I was focusing on the first part of this plan, I saw that precious time was irretrievably lost. <br>  I read that actually 1 in 1 idea will be implemented already by this summer, <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/news/nedorogoy-planshet-leappad-explorer-dlya-malenkih-i-lyuboznatelnih/">you can see for example here</a> <br>  I was very upset then.  By the way, the appearance and price - just the same unattainable ideal :) <br>  Then I thought: <br>  1. They, too, have not done anything yet. <br>  2. They are of course great, but our platform may be open to third-party developers, and they, apparently, will not have this <br>  3. Well, who knows about them in Russia in general, and the games will not be on the great and mighty <br>  4. It‚Äôs not forever to give up without even trying <br>  5. A great way to test the approach ‚Äúto loudly talk about the idea is not ready yet‚Äù and whether you can try to put together a team in Habr√© and do something commercial, big and worthwhile together <br><br>  Accordingly, the call of everyone!  Write to me in a personal or oskolade@gmail.com, who you are, how can you help the project. <br>  If this is of interest and you are considering not to take part - short principles at once, so that later there will be no disappointment. <br><br>  1. I want to make a project at least a break-even, and better profitable <br>  2. To make it more fun, all business information will be available at least to the benefit of team members, as well as the maximum for everyone to get acquainted. <br>  3. Sorry if this jars on someone, but I want to reserve the right to make a final decision.  I don‚Äôt know how to organize everything differently, I think otherwise it will be a mess.  At the same time I promise to be as democratic as possible within reasonable limits.  :) <br><br>  Even in conclusion, anticipating the angry comments about the toy itself - I first subscribe to the fact that people need to educate people, not TV, laptop or tablet.  But all children play games and it's good when these games are interesting and develop our kids. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> If you just want to receive information and news - also write.  Be sure to provide. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117841/</a></p>
