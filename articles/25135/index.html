    <blockquote>  Dots can be horizontal, vertical and diagonal. </blockquote><br>  Once again I want to emphasize that the ellipsis is a separate, independent typographical mark and, however it may be, it differs from three points.  In this case, the ellipsis can be formed both by an exclamation mark and a question mark. <br>  What is the difference between the ellipsis and the three dots that led to its appearance?  When typing three points, they seem to merge into one solid line, so that this does not happen, the points begin to fight off from each other with additional spaces.  Thus, the set began to look more smooth and pleasant to the eye.  This is the eternal ‚Äústruggle‚Äù of incidental fonts with text: a text font always strives for even gray, as if trying to turn into a ribbon, and an incidental font tries to be as bright and unusual as possible, to cheer the line up to attract the reader‚Äôs view. <br><h2>  Technical Reference </h2><br>  Whatever the dots in the ellipsis do not merge into a solid line, they beat off from each other (the distance between the points increases).  The exception is monospaced fonts, where each character has the same width, <nobr>so</nobr>  the ellipsis fits into one symbol and becomes shorter, and the three points, respectively, into three symbols!  But this means that when typing in monospaced font, you need to use punctuation marks focusing on their further fate: if these are texts for a site that is most likely not decorated in a fixed-width font, you should use ellipsis, and if the comments in the code are three dots. <br><blockquote>  It has <nobr>UTF-code</nobr> 2026. <nobr>HTML-codes</nobr> &amp; hellip;  and &amp; # 133;  and <nobr>ASCII code</nobr> 133 (Alt + 0133) </blockquote><br><h2>  History reference </h2><br>  Ellipsis was used <nobr>before BC.</nobr>  and to name the exact dates of the appearance of this symbol is not possible and is not necessary in the context of this article.  Ellipsis was used in ancient Greece to replace the ‚Äúthat everyone understands,‚Äù for example, with the ellipsis it would be possible to end the phrase ‚Äúdo not put your nose in your business‚Äù, like this: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt put your nose on ...‚Äù.  This is the most primitive example; you can think up an analogy yourself.  Similarly, the Greeks and Romans used dots in syntactic constructions that looked unfinished and in constructions due to the characteristics of Latin. <br>  But even understandable constructions with dots in the case of their multiple union turn into a bundle of disconnected words that have no boundaries.  What <a href="http://b23.ru/pxl">Quintilianus</a> (Quintillianus, in Latin) said in his writings, calling for the use of ellipses only in those cases where ‚Äúeverything is already clear‚Äù!  This, of course, caused controversy: how to figure out where it is clear, and where not.  I want to repeat that these problems were caused, in many respects, by the peculiarities of the language and are peculiar to the European community, but not to Russian, the Russian language is distinguished by language constructions. <br><br>  The first to use dots in Russia was Karamzin in the XVIII century.  And initially it was used as an artistic device, mainly in prose, for expressing the emotional component, and only then migrated into ordinary texts as a symbol of understatement and incompleteness, intermittentness, <nobr>etc.</nobr> <br>  <nobr>The</nobr> prelude is <nobr>finally</nobr> over and we can get down to the real questions of the application of the ellipsis in practice.  Hooray! <br><h2>  Terms of Use </h2><br>  When dots are used? <br><ol><li>  To display speech hitches (even in the midst of words): </li></ol><br>  To indicate that the beginning or end of a quote does not coincide with the beginning or end of a sentence in the quoted text, for example: <br>  <em>Pushkin, evaluating all his predecessors, wrote: "... Some odes of Derzhavin, despite the incorrectness of the language and the unevenness of the syllable, are filled with gusts of genius ...".</em> <br><br><br>  To indicate a pass within a quote, for example: <br>  <em>Marx wrote that "language ... is practical, existing for other people and only by that existing also for me, real consciousness".</em> <br><br><br>  At the beginning of the text or sentence in order to reflect the inconsistency of thought, or a large time interval separating the sentence from the previous one. <br>  <em>‚Äú... Wha ... wa ... wa ... Your Excellency," Popov whispered.</em> <br><br><br>  In places where the end of the phrase is well known, for example: <br>  <em>"With whom you will lead ..."</em> <em><br></em>  <em>"We wanted the best ..."</em> <br><br><br>  To indicate the intervals (along with a dash and a division mark &amp; ‚Äã‚Äã# 247;) <br>  <em>+ 7 ... + 9C</em> <em><br></em>  <em>15 ... 19 kilograms</em> <br><br><br><h3>  In math </h3><br>  To skip numbers in sequence: <br>  <em>1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10</em> <br><br><br>  To record periodicals or transcendental numbers: <br>  <em>1/3 = 0.33333333 ...</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Pi = 3.14159 ...</em> <br><br><br><h3>  In RuNet </h3><br>  To display an ongoing list of pages, for example, in search results, it is sometimes drawn up as a link: <br>  <em>... 2 3 4 5 6 7 ... <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25135/"><sup>1</sup></a></em> <em><br></em>  <em>1 ... 15 16 17</em> <br><br><br>  As a list of item numbers displayed on the current page or following in the page navigation list: <br>  <em>1 ... 15 16 ... 30 31 ... 45 <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25135/"><sup>2</sup></a></em> <br><br><br>  In the news, in addition to the ‚Äúfurther‚Äù: <br>  <em>more ... <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25135/"><sup>3</sup></a></em> <br><br><br><br><h2>  Terms of use </h2><br>  How to use it correctly? <br><ol><li>  Dots bounces off the next word with a space and does not bounce off the previous word: <br>  <em>Around the darkness ... and only the small lights of the city in the distance ...</em> <br><br></li><li>  When in one place there are both ellipsis, and a comma, the comma is absorbed by ellipses: <br>  <em>My work ... but, by the way, we will not talk about it.</em> <br><br></li><li>  When ellipses, and question or exclamation marks are found in one place, they are combined using the point of the question or exclamation mark: <br>  <em>Well, what are you thinking again? ..</em> <br>  At the same time, the distance between the question mark and the point should be reduced.  And if there is an <nobr>exclamation question</nobr> mark, then one point is added! <br>  <em>Yes, how much can you dig, at the <nobr>end of something</nobr> ?!.</em> <br><br></li><li>  In direct speech, if after a dot there is a dash, then it (the dash) does not beat off with a space from the dot: <br>  <em>‚ÄúHave you thought? .. Are you sure? ..‚Äù she said in a weakened voice.</em> <br><br></li><li>  If quotes or brackets are after the ellipsis, then they are not beaten off with a space from the ellipsis: <br>  <em>He said: "I do not understand your words ..."</em> <br><br></li><li>  If an ellipsis is found in the header, highlighted in a separate line, then, like the exclamation and question marks, it is not omitted.  It is worth noting that the point in this case is omitted. <br>  <em>In search of truth ...</em> <br>  or <br>  <em>Will Microsoft buy Yahoo ...</em> <br><br></li><li>  If the ellipsis is at the beginning of the sentence, it does not bounce off with a space: <br>  <em>... The night passed and the first rays of the sun began to play on the tops of the trees.</em> <br><br></li><li>  In the set to discharge, the spaces between the ellipsis and the previous word should be unchanged: <br>  <em>Again and again‚Ä¶</em> <br>  but not <br>  <em>Again and again ‚Ä¶</em> <br><br></li><li>  In numeric intervals, the ellipsis does not beat off with spaces: <br>  <em>1 ... 3</em> <em><br></em>  <em>+ 29 ... + 31</em> <br><br></li><li>  If the quotation is not fully cited, the omission is indicated by an ellipsis, which is put: <ul><li>  before the quotation (after opening quotes), syntactically unrelated to the author's text, to indicate that the quotation is not given from the beginning of the sentence: L. N. Tolstoy wrote: <br>  <em>"... in art, simplicity, brevity and clarity is the highest perfection of an art form, which is achieved only with great talent and great work";</em> <br><br></li><li>  in the middle of a quote, when part of the text is missing inside it: <br>  <em>Speaking about the virtues of the language of folk poetry, the speaker recalled: ‚ÄúIt is not by chance that our Russian classics ... recommended reading fairy tales, listening to popular speech, learning proverbs, reading writers who have all the richness of Russian speech‚Äù;</em> <br><br></li><li>  after quotation (before closing quotes), when the quoted sentence is not fully provided: <br>  <em>Speaking in defense of the culture of oral speech, Chekhov wrote: ‚ÄúIn fact, for an intelligent person, speaking badly should be considered just as impropriety as not being able to read and write ...‚Äù</em> <br><br></li></ul></li><li>  After the quotation ending in ellipsis, the point is put if the quotation is not an independent sentence: <br>  <em>M. V. Lomonosov wrote that ‚Äúthe beauty, splendor, strength and wealth of the Russian language is evident enough from books written in past centuries ...‚Äù.</em> <br><br></li><li>  If quoting cut out large parts of the text or whole sentences, it is customary to surround the ellipsis with angle brackets: <br>  <em>The article was sharp, sharp, but although Pushkin, starting the publication of the magazine, did not ‚Äústrive to exacerbate journalistic polemics &lt;...&gt;, Pushkin appreciated the article by Gogol and took it in the first issue, advising the author to soften the most sharp expressions‚Äù</em> quote was taken from <a href="http://www.ruthenia.ru/document/528674.html">articles by P. Reifman</a> . <br><br></li></ol><br><h2>  Note </h2><br><ol><li>  /&gt; </li></ol>  /&gt; This option, I generally propose not to use, too cumbersome and poorly remembered even with the current work, for such a numbering there are items on the pages you are viewing, isn‚Äôt it? <br><br>  In general, such a formulation has recently been used less and less, replacing it with a suitable phrase: <br>  <em>Some time ago we told you about the launch of the Mooteam.ru service and, having received a lot of useful comments, we decided to tell about the new feature on the site - dating service - and once again listen to constructive criticism.</em> <br><br>  /&gt; Paragraphs 10, 11 are completely copied from <a href="http://www.booference.pochta.ru/punct_xxxii.html"><nobr>¬ß 125.
