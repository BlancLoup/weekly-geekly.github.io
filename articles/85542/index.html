      The Final Fantasy series of games has always been famous for its quality, duration and development time ... as well as being known as one of the most expensive manufactured in Japan.  Because the amount of 48 million looks here quite organically - and this is not counting the cost of advertising. <br><br>  8. LA Noire: 50 million dollars <br><br>  LA Noire - thanks to the statement of the President of the Association of Australian Game Developers - Tom Crago - is currently known as ‚Äúone of the most expensive games in production at the moment‚Äù - all of this, thanks to serious financial support from the company Rockstar (expressed in currently the amount of 50 million), trying to create a truly cinematic game, designed in the style of the 40s of the last century. <br><br>  7. APB: 50 million dollars <br><br>  Dave Jones (the founder of Realtime Worlds, the company responsible for developing this unusual MMO, has said many times that APB is the most expensive game he has ever worked on ... 50 million were needed to problems overpower long development, stretching for 5 long years.  In addition, it is planned to spend a million dollars a year to maintain and finalize the game after its full launch. <br><br>  6. Halo 3: 55 million dollars <br><br>  The first two parts of Halo were so successful that, theoretically, Halo 3 had an unlimited budget - if only by the time the game was released, it was as good as possible in all its aspects.  As a result, 55 million spent on development and another 200 million on advertising support for the game. <br><br>  5. Metal Gear Solid 4: 60 million dollars <br><br>  The largest, most beautiful and complex game from the Metal Gear Solid series is the long hours of cut-scenes, outstanding visual performance for its time and 4 years of development. <br><br>  4. Too Human: more than 60 million dollars <br><br>  During the development of the game its creators - Silicon Knights - faced with many difficulties, entailing an increase in the budget several times.  One of these ‚Äúdifficulties‚Äù was a trial with Epic Games, regarding the use of the Unreal Engine 3 in the game - which ended with the ‚Äúsilicone knights‚Äù had to redo the game engine from scratch at the moment when it was almost finished.  All this added to the total cost of development, at least - 10 million dollars. <br><br>  3. Shenmue: 70 million dollars <br>  The budget of this game, released for the SEGA Dreamcast console, was unheard of for electronic entertainment of that time - for 10 years no one could move Shenmue from the top line of the most expensive games ... huge spaces for exploration, dynamic weather change system, incredible attention to detail - even now games are not done with such "thoroughness."  However, for one reason or another, many did not notice or did not appreciate all that the game could offer.  As a result - unreasonably low sales. <br><br>  2. Gran Turismo 5: 80 million dollars <br><br>  The fifth part of the Gran Turismo is preparing to become the largest and coolest racing simulator in the history of video games - this is 5 years of development, 1000 modeled cars and the ultimate realism in everything.  In mid-2008, $ 60 million was already spent on creating the game, two years later this amount will increase to 80 million - which will allow it to become the second in the list of the most expensive games in history. <br><br>  1. <b>Grand Theft Auto 4: 100 million dollars</b> <br><br>  The main thing here is the scope.  About 1,000 people worked on the game for 3.5 years - this includes many months of walking around New York with a camera in their hands, trying to capture all the features of traffic and people's behavior, and negotiations with thousands and thousands of people responsible for granting rights to use music that appeared in the game (only the presence of the melody in the game itself costs about $ 10,000, not taking into account the purchase of licenses and royalties).  The game has enough content to keep the average gamer at the TV screen for 100 hours ... well, $ 100 million ... and GTA 4 is the most expensive game in history. <br><br>  <i>by rick_casey</i> <br>  <i>taken: <a href="http://www.qeek.ru/">qeek.ru</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85542/</a></p>
