  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In the beginning was the Word</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the last <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/148665/">post about freelancing</a> , on the basis of my categorically negative attitude to work, as to an occupation for slaves, a discussion flared up, the meaning of which is that not everyone can be a business owner, someone should be a hired employee.  Yes, no doubt it is.  People are different, some can brilliantly organize, others are not able to operate with this vast array of information, risks and decisions, but they are able to create masterpieces in a narrowly sharpened direction and there is nothing wrong or shameful about it.  To each his own. <br><br>  But still, I continue to insist on the view that work is for slaves.  This is hidden in the very name of the word.  Work is what is done from want, through power.  Under pressure of circumstances.  What a person would not do if he had the opportunity.  Work can not be loved - it is self-deception. <br><br>  In opposition to work, there is another word - deed.  The point is something that captures, brings pleasure.  What would a person do even if he had to pay for it.  What can be proud of, that is the subject of self-realization.  Favorite business reveals the potential of man, frees monstrous performance and dedication.  The desire to make better and more perfect.  And if so, then the quality and efficiency of labor is sharply increasing.  And, naturally, the income from business increases.  For the quality is ready to pay each of you, I have no doubt.

      And do not confuse business with a hobby or business, then only special cases.  Rocketry for the Queen was neither a business nor a hobby and, of course, it was not a job.  It was a business, a life business, for which it was worth living.  And only in this case there can be a sense and something great will be born. <br><br>  Everything else is a waste of life, killing people for hateful work or for a flawed business, which brings only irritation and anxiety.  And the essence of the matter is unimportant - a professional sysadmin may, with trepidation, strive to create and perfect control over a colossal network, an ordinary engineer can develop a steel-made squiggle perfect in all respects for the landing gear of the new aircraft.  It is not important, if only it delivered. <br><br>  Recently, in Auchan, I paid attention to the design of the wheel of a commodity cart, which rolls in a straight line and firmly stands on the inclined surface of the travelator.  It‚Äôs just a wheel of some kind of fucking cart, but I would be incredibly proud if it were I who had such a brilliant design that came to mind in its simplicity, reliability and manufacturability. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Do you make for yourself the difference between work and work?  Inside, on an everyday level.  It would seem, what's the difference how to call?  Even so, even though the essence seems to be the same.  There is a difference - different words, different meanings, different emotional coloring.  Emotions affect perception and, ultimately, the motivation and satisfaction of work.  On the result. <br><br>  For me, it all started with the fact that I clearly, to the shiver, realized this difference.  I appreciated what I do.  Can I call this my business.  I could not.  Immediately quit and seemingly did the same thing, but there was a nuance.  It was already a deal.  The fact that I love, what is rushing me.  The same, but mine.  Nothing has changed, but at the same time everything has changed. <br><br>  Since then, I have avoided the words ‚Äúwork‚Äù, ‚Äúearned‚Äù, ‚Äúearnings‚Äù and all derivatives in relation to myself.  Aloud, in thought, in the text - everywhere.  It is difficult, habits, their mother, but this alone changes thinking, makes you pull yourself up and look around.  Ask questions, and if I even do?  Do I need this?  Warns against mistakes and wrong ways, getting into a rut of habit and routine. <br><br>  Are you still working?  Maybe it's time to quit this useless killing of life and get down to business? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148686/</a></p>
