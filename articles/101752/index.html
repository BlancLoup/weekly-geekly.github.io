  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT economy. How not to stay out of progress</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The IT industry is the fastest growing sector of the economy at the moment, and this is no secret to anyone.  With all the positive aspects that this industry can give to an employee or a company, it is worthwhile to realize that the speed of development and the information flow can act as a negative factor in development. <br><br>  In this article I will try to identify the main points of human development, which is engaged in the IT field and the development of the industry as a whole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/95e/079/e35/95e079e352f4b9ac62933ba4e91dc57a.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Indicators </h4><br>  As indicators, I chose the following: <i>my own estimate of value</i> , <i>level of interest,</i> and <i>time</i> .

      Why exactly these?  Over time, I hope, questions will not arise, since all the processes in our world occur in time, which is a feature of the dimension of our Universe. <br><br>  <i>Own cost estimate</i> is the level of payment claimed by the programmer, coder, database administrator or system administrator.  This is not necessarily the real level, this desire.  Everyone has quite a normal desire to receive over time more and more wages. <br><br>  Sometimes the desire curve coincides with real incomes, especially if the person is modest and is satisfied with the increases that the employer makes.  Sometimes the desired is strongly at variance with the real, but this is not important, since the essence does not change.  The employee always tries to realize his desire to receive an adequate assessment of his knowledge and skills, expressed in currency notes, wealth and so on. <br><br>  This curve ( <b><i>a</i></b> ) at the same time is an expenditure part for companies and shows well the level of costs for labor and intellectual resources. <br><br>  <i>The curve of interest</i> ( <b><i>b</i></b> ) shows the level of interest of people in those or other technologies.  This may be the interest of the industry as a whole, or the interest of a particular person to a particular technology. <br><br>  Using these indicators, you can calmly describe the processes that occur in the industry and in the development of each person. <br><br><h4>  Interconnection </h4><br>  Consider the option when the curve a shows the interest of the industry to some technology.  In the initial stages, this curve has a very strong growth.  This growth can be stimulated through the media, overheating the market in anticipation of miracle technologies or miracle solutions.  Some time the technology develops, and while there is a development, interest growth continues.  The cost curve <b><i>b is</i></b> growing very weakly, since the new technology requires some accumulation of knowledge and skills. <br><br>  Over time, interest in technology fades away as the market becomes saturated.  As the market becomes saturated, there is an increase in labor costs for qualified specialists, which leads to a decrease in the business profit margin from using this technology.  The intersection of curves <b><i>a</i></b> and <b><i>b</i></b> (shaded area) shows the profit margin.  It is quite possible that a decline in interest in some technology occurs when there is a decrease in business profitability. <br><br>  Point <b>A</b> on this graph shows the economic death of technology.  No, it will not be abandoned for some time, since there is a lag in development, but it is no longer necessary to wait for large capital investments in it. <br><br>  That the employee, who plans to learn something new, that a company that collects or uses technology in its products, must clearly understand how much time this technology has left to live on the market.  Otherwise, you can very quickly fly into the tube. <br><br>  Stimulating the growth of interest in technology (curve <b><i>b '</i></b> ) will give a temporary increase in profitability, to which employees will instantly react, increasing wage requirements. <br><br>  If the technology died before the employee's maximum desires were reached (curve <b><i>a '</i></b> ), then an interesting effect arises: specialists who knew the old technology were in demand for some time because it was necessary to maintain the old systems, programs, devices, and the employee receives a unique a chance to raise wages because of the uniqueness of knowledge, until point <b>C</b> is reached, after which demand is reduced to nothing. <br><br>  On the other hand, curve <b><i>a</i></b> shows the interest of the employee to study or use certain technologies, at the same time shows the interest in this specialty, and simply the interest to work. <br><br>  The intersection of the lines <b><i>a</i></b> and <b><i>b</i></b> in this case will show the cost of training a specialist.  At the beginning of the development of a specialist, there is almost no increase in personal assessment, since the process of knowledge accumulation is going on.  Over time, with the growth of an employee in professional terms, his wishes in wages will grow until he reaches the point of loss for the company, or until a person loses interest in this technology or the industry as a whole. <br><br>  If you try to temper employee requests, and move the curve to <b><i>a</i></b> , the company will not particularly benefit, since the decision to change jobs or a specialty will be made due to the extinction of the employee‚Äôs interest in the work itself.  The growth of interest leads to a rapid appreciation of the cost of the employee, reaching the point of unprofitability <b>B</b> and, as a result, dismissal. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  What conclusions can be drawn from the above? <br><br><ul><li>  Employees and the company must keep their ears open so as not to miss the decline of interest in technology.  The IT industry is developing very rapidly, and what was relevant two years ago may be the last century tomorrow. </li><li>  It is best to pay close attention to new technologies, since the costs of studying and using them remain low for quite a long time, and profitability is growing. </li><li>  The staff turnover, the increase in the cost of labor, the extinction of interest in work were, are and will be.  In order to minimize these processes, you need to try to return to the zero point of interest.  This is achieved by changing the profile of work (the same career growth), the study of new technologies and other things. </li><li>  Startups with the use of new technologies will be more profitable if the technology succeeds. </li></ul><br>  The processes that occur in the economy, very easily fit into two or three graphics.  The same graph can describe dozens of processes.  This suggests that everything is closely connected with each other, the system balances itself, and the imbalance can lead to sad consequences for all. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <i>thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/kirgudu/" class="user_link">Kirgudu</a> for the bug found</i> <br>  <b>UPD2:</b> <i>restored the link to the picture</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101752/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101752/</a></p>
