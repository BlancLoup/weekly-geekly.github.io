      The most interesting thing about MIPS is running in technologies.  They just don‚Äôt come here with an idea, don‚Äôt ask for investments based on a prototype - we need an already working technology.  Therefore, the exhibition does not have ‚Äúnothing like this has ever been seen before,‚Äù but many solutions are ready for implementation here and now. <br><br>  This year, two trends are clearly visible: automation of systems and introduction of video analytics. <br><br>  Automation concerns buildings, vehicles, access control systems and fire and security systems.  This trend is developed within the framework of the IoT concept and is presented by: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ sets of devices for smart homes: temperature, humidity, air pollution sensors, video surveillance cameras; <br>  ‚Ä¢ intelligent vehicle control systems: GPS / GLONASS trackers, gasoline consumption sensors, cameras; <br>  ‚Ä¢ automated access control systems, intercoms and barriers, <br>  ‚Ä¢ automated security and fire alarms and smoke and gas detectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/310/556/93e/31055693eeec418aad3d1946110bd017.jpg"><br>  <i>On the left is a photo from one of the open-air presentations, on the right - pictures from the stand at MIPS</i> <br><br>  The robot "Tral Patrol 4.0" replaces the guards in closed areas.  The wheeled robot moves around the object without operator intervention, stopping at predetermined points of the route that are optimal for observation, is able to identify a person at a distance of up to 120 meters, and at a distance of up to 60 meters to recognize a face. <br><br>  If a human figure is recognized in the detailed image of the PTZ camera, the robot issues an alarm to the security post, where the guard decides: to reset the alarm, turn on the siren or strobe on the robot, or personally follow the intrusion site and deal with the intruder. <br><br>  When using several robots on the same object, their mutual movement is synchronized so that at any time under video surveillance there is as much as possible the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe protected object.  Operating time without recharging 12 hours at a maximum speed of 15 km / h. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6f/fca/bf5/b6ffcabf5dac404a8ea6817aaa26304a.jpg"><br><br>  Multisensor distance monitoring system.  Detection range up to 1100 meters.  In addition to the camera itself, there is also a thermal imager.  The system rotates both vertically and horizontally.  Additionally, it can be equipped with a zoom lens - zoom lens (with variable focal length). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32a/60c/5f2/32a60c5f2ba04f51b2c6c0dcf47ff63e.jpg"><br><br>  Explosion-proof chambers made of stainless steel with heated glass and other specialized chambers for working in hazardous areas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f79/728/311/f797283118114d1cb747d4c0e5d53f4f.jpg"><br><br>  PanoVu 360 ¬∞ camera with hardware stitching images from Hikvision. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0e/ef2/586/e0eef258607b42c9a83a9de8b3f49082.jpg"><br><br>  Cameras, frightening violators with one of their kind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/843/d11/242/843d112428814f3fa96d4045654b3770.jpg"><br><br>  Test benches, demonstrating the interaction of video surveillance systems and transport infrastructure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/243/16e/95f/24316e95f62a4fe68bff9d57d782d709.jpg"><br><br>  Clutching look advertising, where without it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f46/433/a89/f46433a8904e470a9f7774ff133703d1.jpg"><br><br>  Colleagues from China showed a miracle flashlight - not only the source of light, but also a ‚Äúsafety tool‚Äù.  At the exhibition, Chinese companies occupied about 25% of the territory.  They brought a variety of equipment, including everything needed to create their own brand of video surveillance cameras from the stage of creating a chip at the factory.  Lack of knowledge in the field of the Russian language did not bother anyone - <a href="https://translate.google.com/">translate.google.com</a> will always come to the rescue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/135/1f4/fde/1351f4fdead34157b932453cf8d46e1d.jpg"><br><br>  Israeli startup Tarantula Technologies brought Hunter 1. This is a warning system that prevents the placement of explosive devices under vehicles, providing 360 ¬∞ protection under the body.  Ziko is a portable / stationary warning system for the security of open spaces, with a wide coverage of up to 10,000 (horizontal) / 5,800 (vertical) square meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c14/fe2/1e7/c14fe21e73624a479757f48265a082f1.jpg"><br><br>  Employee search and detection system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92f/af9/575/92faf957530e4b08b70b980393630600.jpg"><br><br>  Two ways to see in the dark are a thermal imager and a laser camera with a range of up to 5 km. <br><br><h2>  Copters and drones protection </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/957/e8b/80c/957e8b80cf7940b192401c0bdc4b8549.jpg"><br><br>  Security and video surveillance includes drones.  Saw them at Hikvision and Dahua.  Top photo - drone Dahua.  A 4K camera or a thermal imager is attached to the copter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c15/9f6/b4f/c159f6b4fe9246d2a3e720304cc7b7a5.jpg"><br><br>  Hikvision drone ‚ÄúHawk‚Äù: flight speed 80 km / h, radius of action 10 km, continuous flight up to 33 minutes.  At the end of 2016, Hikvision began to actively develop the direction of drones and showed already a whole series of flying vehicles, including even hex coppers.  At Dahua, for example, while only one model operates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a0/ae9/2d7/6a0ae92d725245b88c1a8ec50775dccd.jpg"><br><br>  Showed a gun to "kill" the drones.  The device is capable of forcibly planting a drone operating at a frequency of 2.4 GHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a0/73b/47f/0a073b47fbe2440eae48332b46cb1979.jpg"><br><br>  Drones can not only control the territory, but also to spy.  There are companies specializing in the protection of all flying. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcd/a67/c04/dcda67c041cc41cf8c3f4a8ca51c83d7.jpg"><br><br>  Stopdron - complex detection and neutralization of UAVs with a range of up to a kilometer. <br><br><h2>  Most discussed </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/649/568/bff/649568bffb534473a1291a88d33aa877.JPG"><br><br>  Most of the reports of the conference ‚ÄúPossibilities of cloud technologies and the Internet of things for business‚Äù, one of the moderators of which was Ivideon CEO Andrey Yudnikov, were devoted to the development of smart homes, building automation, video analytics as an effective tool for the retail, restaurant business and security in general. <br><br>  According to estimates of the Berg Insight analytic group, the IoT market volume grows to $ 19 trillion by 2025, of which $ 14.4 trillion is in the private sector.  The main contribution to growth will be provided by transport, industry, health and consumer sector <br><br>  We talked about our own business products and trends in the development of cloud solutions (and in particular video surveillance) in the world and in Russia.  Links to presentations and video presentations by other participants will soon appear <a href="http://www.securika-moscow.ru/ru-RU/business-programme/cloud-iot/Programm.aspx">on the MIPS 2017 website</a> .  Ivideon's talk can be heard below. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNVmbm9eDk0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In addition to the video surveillance service itself, we showed other solutions for business: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ video surveillance on moving objects; <br>  ‚Ä¢ partner programs for installers, integrators, distributors, telecom operators (the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/article/285344/">project with MegaFon</a> ) and service providers; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ivideon Enterprise Cloud; <br>  ‚Ä¢ video surveillance under your brand - Ivideon White Label; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ivideon/blog/314138/">MIMO antennas</a> for signal amplification: allow you to organize video surveillance where there is no stable signal, but there is a base station at a distance of 20 km; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ivideon/blog/306714/">open API and mobile SDK</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ivideon/blog/286168/">visitors counting and queue control</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ivideon/blog/285948/">integration with cash systems</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ service updates: remote setup of cameras, grouping of cameras, mobile layouts, linking cameras through mobile applications, release on Windows 10 Mobile, support for operation of Axis cameras. <br><br>  From this list have not yet been told only about video surveillance for transport and Ivideon Enterprise Cloud.  The last service allows you to store data on your own server / in the data center - to build "your own Ivideon" in the way you want it.  Novelties interesting and soon we will write about them separately. <br><br>  If you didn‚Äôt manage to ask your question to our managers at the stand, call 8 800 555 42 97 or <a href="">write</a> - we will discuss everything that interests you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370339/</a></p>
