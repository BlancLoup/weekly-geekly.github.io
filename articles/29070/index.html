Pour yourself some tea and sit back. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So let's start with the fact that most people blame politicians for everything from wars to the untidy landing. <br>  My opinion on this issue (after close communication with some politicians): <br>  The policy in our countries is in a state of ‚Äúunstable equilibrium‚Äù and when we try to seriously intervene there, as it seems to us, in the end we‚Äôm pushing some of them a little bit, giving money to others.  But this does not mean that in general it is necessary to sit and be silent; without our help, whatever the government, it cannot keep track of everything from Topol-M missiles to "Drinking husband of Aunt Nyura from the 3rd floor."  Assistance, for example, can be expressed in informing higher authorities about problems in the field.

      Some adhere to the opinion that here is what a trifle and clean up the landing? <br>  Again, look above, and no one bothers you if it‚Äôs so bad to refuse the services of an unscrupulous housing office and take care of your improvement (there were precedents, but it‚Äôs not as easy as it seems).  Well, at least at least let's "not litter", i.e.  do not create problems for yourself and people without a reason. <br>  Yes, and as we know, whatever a huge structure (program) begins with the first brick (line of code) that someone needs to put in, and so far no one will do it and it will be empty. <br><br>  The essence of the foregoing is that one does not have to wait for the solution of one‚Äôs own problems with ‚Äúotkudato‚Äù and blame someone for one‚Äôs failures, one has to figure them out and try to fix it.  And also there is nothing wrong with a properly done act.  Let it be just a cigarette butt thrown out of you in the urn.  Even there may be too much thanks to the girl in the stall.  Let's set the first stone, and maybe build a castle in which we will live happily with you <br><br>  <b>Well, in the end I would like to propose the following idea, because</b>  <b>We are IT front workers, I propose to pile up and do the following:</b> <br><br>  <b>The crux of the problem:</b> Often we see in the news a description of any resonant events.  Over time, these events leave the category of interesting and they are forgotten.  As a result, the guilty are not punished, the story is forgotten. <br><br>  <b>My suggestion: I</b> propose to make a simple site sign: <br>  Problem |  Actions taken (chronology of events) |  Total <br>  And fill it all together.  Something like a global to-do list. <br>  For example, I will cite a story with downed people in Kharkov at a trolleybus stop.  As a result, it was not possible to find the end of this story on the Internet, since  the investigation lasted a long time and everyone who was not involved had already managed to forget about it, but for the media it was not so interesting. <br><br>  <b>What we get from this:</b> And we get from this, beyond anyone, a good tool for tracking events.  And also amuse our self-esteem that we have done a good political affair. <br><br>  If anyone is interested in this idea, please unsubscribe. <br><br>  It turned out a bit messy, I did not express a lot of thoughts (maybe I will insert something along the way). <br><br>  Well, I will not change my style: <br><br>  PS: Please do not touch the karma, i.e.  do not increase (because I want to dismiss this sim from the suspicion that I wrote it all for the sake of karma and decided to sort of like "swim on the wave of this topic").  and do not lower because  with this you will create dysbalance (i.e. no one raises, although it may, but you lower it).  Those.  like, read, think, offer.  Do not like it, pass by or minus the topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29070/</a></p>
