  <section class="page js-page"><h1>First, the "skeleton", and then the "meat", or why startups are unsuccessful</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  First, the "skeleton", and then the "meat". <br>  First the process, and then the tool for the process. <br>  Automation of chaos gives chaos. <br><br>  These are all different formulations of one simple idea.  An idea that is often overlooked in many things. <br><br>  For example, consider startups.  It usually happens like.  A person has the idea that a certain process will be interesting to a group of people.  And a person creates a startup, a site where these people will have to use the site as a tool for the process. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      The following points are not taken into account. <br>  1. The process itself can exist only in the imagination of the creator of the startup.  For example, the aggregation process of CSKA match results may not be needed at all by the fans of this football club, no matter how a start-up would imagine it.  Therefore, it is important to be in the process itself, to understand which process is real and which is not. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2. The process itself may be wrong.  For example, in a company this is the case when a manager makes contracts.  The task of the sales manager is to sell.  And to create contracts there must be a separate unit - the contract department.  Thus, if you automate the wrong process, then after transferring the process to the correct (more precisely, more optimal) process, the tool will have to be thrown out and redone in a new way.  The process modification itself, by the way, in business is called business process reengineering. <br><br>  3. The tool may be created incorrectly, not taking into account the specifics of the audience.  As in part of the architecture of the project, its structure, and in terms of the user interface.  In general, Alan Cooper, a well-known expert in the development of projects, in his stunning work ‚ÄúMental Hospital in the Hands of Patients‚Äù called this science an interaction design.  At the same time pointing to the increasing role in connection with the widespread use of computers, and, as a consequence, an increase in the percentage of their interaction with man. <br><br>  The bottom line is that computers work according to one law, the human brain and psychology work according to others.  And in order to create a convenient and effective process of interaction between a person and a computer, you need to be an expert in both areas.  And not only in the field of computers, as is happening now.  And why we just see a huge number of uncomfortable and complex programs and interfaces, with rare pearls like Apple products. <br><br>  Thus, the probability to create a startup from these points is made up of the product of the probability of passing each stage: P = P <sub>1</sub> * P <sub>2</sub> * P <sub>3</sub> . <br><br>  Therefore, for a successful startup, you must either be yourself an expert in these three tasks - exploring possible options, which are or can be processes;  the ability to build the right process flow diagram and the ability to create the right tools for the processes, or be able to organize and monitor specialists in these areas. <br><br>  It is empirically known that even in each of the three areas there are terribly few specialists, a little more organizers, but also not enough.  Compared to the number of people trying to create websites.  Therefore, the percentage of successful startups is extremely small. <br><br>  The same applies to business.  The reason is not at all in the mythical talents of the businessman, but in the fundamental science - the science of thinking.  And personal qualities, of course. <br><br>  Of course, the reader can say - what about sales, marketing, usability, bookkeeping?  You can answer quite simply.  If you ask a person who is an outstanding expert in his field, whether it be music, vocals, business, drawing pictures or accounting, he will be able to explain the essence of this or that phenomenon to you "on your fingers".  For the basis of traditional things are simple ideas and objectives.  Both the sciences and art themselves were initially simple, and only later evolved into more complex ones.  It works everywhere, with rare exceptions. <br><br>  Therefore, when a thick textbook on economics is studied, knowledge is learned and attempts are made to apply recipes, without understanding the essence of the phenomenon, the result will be negative.  Until a person empirically, or by studying the experience of others, is not aware of the wisdom inherent in his knowledge, he will not miss a chip, as it is now fashionable to say. <br><br>  And the first in this case is from practical steps - correctly asked questions and searching for answers to them. <br>  For, as the great writer Robert Sheckley wrote in his story ‚ÄúThe Right Question, <a href="http://www.nesenenko.narod.ru/BOOKS/SHEKLY29.html">‚Äù ‚Äúin order to properly ask a question, you need to know most of the answer.‚Äù</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139530/</a></p>
