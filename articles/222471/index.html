  <section class="page js-page"><h1>By 2019, two-thirds of smartphones will be developed by hardware platform vendors.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Today, in certain circles, it is considered good form to talk about the lack of innovation in the field of smartphones, as well as about the huge number of secondary solutions.  One can argue about innovation for a very long time, but it‚Äôs hard to disagree with point two.  You go to the store, and on the shelves dozens of similar smartphones from local domestic brands.  Among them are almost complete twins, and almost identical models with minimal differences (for example, a camera in one by 3 megapixels, and in the other by 5). <br><br>  It is clear that most of our megabrens are tarnished in the same factories, Chinese merchants are extremely rare in building Chinese, they [businessmen] are used to take what they give.  So it turns out that smartphones resemble each other like two drops of water.  It‚Äôs time to exclaim: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want a dull Chinese thing, take Samsung, HTC or even Nokia!‚Äù  Yes, today the products of these and a number of other firms stand out against the background of products sold under our brands.  It will stand out, as a rule, with design, ergonomics, camera quality and software chips, but in terms of hardware it is inferior at a comparable price.  (More details, for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/216259/">here</a> ) In the meantime, the average buyer still believes in the power of the brand, due to which the inexpensive products of major manufacturers are still selling well, although the "locals" <a href="http/habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/202924/">gradually eat off their share.</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51a/0a9/ed0/51a0a9ed0094fd38b8b8368c8d8a7ea6.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Besides the fact that some kind of uniqueness and convenience - perhaps the strongest features of inexpensive smartphones of A-brands - over time, risk partially or completely disappear.  Such a conclusion can be drawn from a <a href="http://digitimes.com/news/a20140505PR202.html">note on the site DigiTimes</a> - one of the most trusted sources from the world of Asian electronics, which refers to a study of the analytical firm ABI Research. <br><br>  In 2013, more than a third of smartphones sold in the world were based on reference designs proposed by chipset developers.  (At the same time, 69 percent of such devices cost less than $ 200.) That is, in Qualcomm, MediaTek, Spreadtrum and other companies make some basic versions of smartphones on their platforms, which are then allowed to produce Chinese and Indian factories.  The latter, due to the lack of engineering experience, cannot do anything sensible, and this option is excellent for them.  Then these "clones" can be sold under their own brand, but you can "sell" our merchants.

      It would seem that in this bad?  And that's what.  In large companies - developers of smartphones (Samsung, HTC, LG, Nokia, and so on) there are whole groups of engineers responsible for the so-called user experience - a complex concept, implying that the device is convenient to use and it does not cause sharp rejection.  Meanwhile, Qualcomm, MediaTek, Spreadtrum and others like them seem to be quite difficult with this - otherwise there would be no cheap 5.5-inch or 6-inch smartphones with a power button on top of the market. <br><br>  <b>So, it would seem, what side here are A-brands?</b>  The thing is that the process of ‚Äúeating away‚Äù the market share with local brands of A-brands is rather tired, and the mastodonts of the market cannot oppose small, but daring companies.  That is, for example, LG has gathered to develop a smartphone for 100 bucks.  She will invest a lot of money in software, develop a unique design, select the correct case materials, ensure the absence of serious glitches even in the first firmware.  And then it turns out that the budget is spent by two thirds, and this device will have to put a frail processor, a 3-inch screen with low resolution and 512 MB of RAM.  The counterpart from the Russian brand / Chinese manufacturer will have glitches and materials less wear-resistant, and the camera is worse, but the display is 5-inch and RAM is gigabytes.  As a result, customers increasingly prefer "Russian Chinese." <br><br>  <b>All this leads to the following:</b> according to ABI Research of Nokia, Samsung, HTC, LG, Huawei and ZTE, very reluctantly, but still begin to use <u>reference device designs offered by chipset developers.</u>  The reasons are simple - saving your position in emerging markets by offering low-cost devices that would win in numbers from similar-priced smartphones of its own design. <br><br>  The question is how seriously these manufacturers will take to finish the reference designs and self-select components.  (Apparently, Qualcomm, MediaTek and Co. not only offer a certain basic smartphone describing its performance characteristics, but also give recommendations - from whom to buy components.) Yes, Samsung, LG and other grants will not bring frank crafts to the market - here, As they say, image is more expensive.  But the desire to save money and compete with the Chinese in the lower segment will also play a certain role.  So, it may very well be that the characteristics of low-priced A-brand products will improve in the future, but user experience will deteriorate somewhat.  At the same time, the design of such ‚Äúnon-native‚Äù smartphones from first-tier manufacturers, most likely, will retain the firm features.  It is enough to remember that even the Russian Highscreen (and in scale it is not Samsung and not even ZTE) for the Zera smartphone line has <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/218105/">developed</a> its own unique design that is not found in devices from Chinese brands.  Plus, he dopilil standard mediatekovskaya platform, crammed, for example, into the budget model Highscreen Zera F 1 GB of RAM instead of 512 MB.  This suggests that the opportunity to dodge and finish something with A-brands will also be, that's just how and how much they will use it ... <br><br>  <b>ABI Research predicts that by 2019,</b> two or three smartphones will be based on reference designs of chipset developers.  23 percent of such devices will cost more than $ 200, the rest - cheaper.  It emphasizes that models priced at more than $ 400 will mostly be developed from scratch by first-tier companies themselves: you can‚Äôt allow chip makers to create them, because the output may not be what the user who paid more than $ 400 expects to see. <br><br>  Personally, this is not something that upsets me, but it does not cause much enthusiasm.  Perhaps because I found the times when each gadget was a kind of piece of engineering.  Now this very art has become a conveyor, and in the foreseeable future, it will also catch up with the main current "sculptors" in the world of electronics. <br><br>  What do you think about this? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222471/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222471/</a></p>
