I also realized that working with this as part of an online marketing course is necessary, but only with those who really need it.  Otherwise, after completing the course, such a person will stay on at home and do not dare to take steps. <br><br>  In one of the classes: <br><br>  - How will I offer my services after your course, if I have just finished it? <br>  - And how did you search for the first job?  Second?  Third? <br>  - Well, as for friends, via the Internet, but I also didn‚Äôt have experience there ... <br>  - What happened? <br>  - I don‚Äôt know, I was just young. <br>  - And ambitious? <br>  - Maybe! <br>  - Sell me yourself!  Right now. <br>  ... <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      It is not important that you think, if I know the subject, I understand it, I can offer and sell my services.  What is the difference on what my positioning is based on, there are technologies, there are templates, what's the difference? <br><br>  And the difference is, and it is very great! <br>  If you can‚Äôt sell me a product, you don‚Äôt believe in it, if you can‚Äôt sell me yourself, you don‚Äôt believe in yourself.  And a person who does not believe in himself will not be a priori successful. <br><br>  What is success? <br><br>  I asked this question to my students.  The answers were different, the main part was taken to enumerate personal qualities, and not just their own, but the qualities of famous people. <br>  Another part listed its own qualities and passionately believed that they were successful and continuous development was the key to success. <br><br>  - However, - I dared to object, - the fact that you came to a marketing training course or a web design course does not make you a developing person at all.  It makes more likely a walking library of knowledge that you don't really understand. <br>  I was objected and I offered to try this objection, to try to start selling myself, to praise, to list everything that a person knows, that he can, that he tried and tested. <br><br>  In response, silence and only an attempt to describe his own illusion of reality, in which this person is worth something, but only in his own ideas. <br><br>  In fact, no one knows about this person.  Only he and his relatives.  Can one call such a person successful?  - not! <br><br>  And can he become one - YES! <br><br>  Success is realized once-potented information plus energy realized in efforts.  Expressed in an objective result. <br><br>  Do you agree? <br>  <b>The value system of a successful person</b> <br><br>  What is most important to you?  And what was the main thing for Steve Jobs? <br>  We can answer the first question if we don‚Äôt lie to ourselves, but on the second we can only guess what values ‚Äã‚Äãhave prevailed in Mr. Jobs. <br><br>  Try to answer yourself - what matters most to you.  What value is included and leads you to those moments when you achieve success. <br>  Remember this state and turn it on as soon as you need it. <br>  The answer to the question about the system of values ‚Äã‚Äãof a successful person, no.  And never was, that would not say psychologists, coaches and other craftsmen. <br><br>  Why? <br><br>  Because success for all of us is something different, different, different from our common social ideas - get rid of the illusions of community!  Success can be achieved by the individual, while remaining kind and sympathetic, but living only according to his own laws of the universe, which he established himself. <br><br>  <b>And what next?</b> <br><br>  Identified leading value?  Determine the value of your client / employer, check for compatibility.  Try to align your values ‚Äã‚Äãand then, no matter what you say, you are accepted.  They will work with you. <br><br>  Believe in yourself <br><br>  Believe in yourself, in your strength.  Faith needs to be supported on something, it just does not work out of thin air, and if it turns out, it does not change the system of your values.  Find a foothold in the knowledge you gained and develop a pattern for yourself. <br>  For example, I learned a course on SEO, but I have no experience, for, that is, knowledge that I can, in theory, use.  I am quickly trained, ambitious and accustomed to achieve goals, both my own and the goals of my employers (did you realize the goals of the enterprise in which you worked?).  This all can create a summary of my personal tool for developing myself in ... some sphere / niche. <br><br>  Try to treat yourself as a tool to achieve goals, a tool that has no history, and therefore no experience, both positive and negative, and therefore self-assessment is not an important question at all. <br>  You begin your journey and you can make it bright only by believing in it and realizing it. <br><br>  Good learning! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298566/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298566/</a></p>
