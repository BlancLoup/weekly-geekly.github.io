The company Dadzhet provided me with a Seek Thermal Compact PRO thermal imager for testing and use in my lighting laboratory.  He has a good resolution matrix and decent functionality.  The review reviewed various lighting lamps.  One of the important parameters is the heating of LEDs in LED lamps, lamps, searchlights.  I especially want to mention the led lamps for Philips MZ LED cars.  Phillips size 1,5x2 mm, and heating can reach 180 degrees.  With such small dimensions it is very difficult to measure the temperature, the mini-pyrometer is the best.  The ideal way to measure heat is a thermal imager, which among the many will show the most superheated, having poor heat dissipation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Special features</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/467/b1f/d17/467b1fd1711e4fa5a5a19012efb467b4.jpg"><br>  <i>Coin size comparison</i>

      A feature of the use of a thermal imager for LEDs is the ability to shoot from a short distance, macro photography.  Such measurements require the ability to adjust the focus, otherwise the boundaries will be blurred.  Blurring affects the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe object being measured and decreases the measurement accuracy. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><blockquote>  Parameter Seek Thermal Compact PRO <br>  Resolution 320 √ó 240 <br>  Range up to 550 m <br>  Temperature range -40 ¬∞ to 330 ¬∞ C <br>  Viewing angle 32 ¬∞ <br>  Focus adjustable <br>  Refresh rate 15 Hz <br>  Price 49950 rub <br>  System Requirements Android 4.4 and up, and OTG </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/20f/199/72c/20f19972c17143bc9020e98ccd940b51.jpg"><br>  <i>Size comparison with a coin and a finger-type battery</i> <br><br>  Number of pixels for different models: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 206 * 156 = 32.136 for the previous ones <br>  ‚Ä¢ 320 * 240 = 76.800 for the new PRO <br>  ‚Ä¢ 76800/32136 = 238% <br><br>  The resolution of the matrix has increased by 238% compared to previous models, the picture is very good, there is very little noise.  The resolution of 320x240 is used on devices of the average price category from 100 to 300 tons. Rubles.  In the more expensive 640x480 and higher is installed, but they cost more than 600 thousand rubles.  To find out the value of any material emission, it is necessary to heat it to a known temperature.  To do this, cook a halogen light bulb in boiling water until it is fully heated and measure degrees.  Boiling water occurs at 100 ¬∞, respectively, and the light bulb will be the same.  immediately measure and calculate the indicator we need. <br><br>  <b>USB connection</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/76b/3e6/427/76b3e64271644c23bb46bc39c96c31fd.jpg"><br>  <i>Packaging, Smartphone and Imager</i> <br><br>  The tested thermal imager has 2 variants of execution, for smartphones on Android and iPhones.  I tested the version for Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b14/c52/37e/b14c5237e4ac48148cba639ebe16b1b7.jpg"><br>  <i>Thermal imager and smartphone</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/db2/41d/fe7/db241dfe74454cc9bb500169a3a82dea.jpg"><br>  <i>Thermal imager and smartphone</i> <br><br>  I encountered 3 small problems that were solved in a short time. <br><br>  Problem number 1.  Work requires at least Android 4.4, so the application refused to install, saying that the device is incompatible.  I am an electronics engineer by education, I‚Äôm careful about electronics, so all smartphones and tablets turned out to be elderly on Android 4.2. <br><br>  Problem number 2.  The second problem was the lack of OTG in half of my Android devices. <br><br>  Problem number 3. There was only one option, to reflash the Explay i1 tablet on Android 4.4.  The firmware change was successful, the application was installed and <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/seek-thermal-sompact-pro/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dseek-thermal-sompact-pro%26utm_content%3Dseek-thermal-sompact-pro%26utm_campaign%3Dseek-thermal-sompact-pro_721">ThermalSik PRO</a> turned on.  But the microUSB port turned 180 degrees.  The result is a thermal imager for selfie. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d55/5dd/32f/d555dd32f5544eb08bb1b79d202c2e8d.jpg"><br>  <i>Thermal imager and tablet</i> <br><br>  For the imager to be directed in the right direction, that is, not for me, an OTG adapter or a micro USB OTG extension is required.  The Chinese, they are sold in a large assortment of 50-100 rubles.  In order not to wait for the delivery, the extension cord was soldered from improvised cables and plugs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/779/49d/ee6/77949dee6d044607bb39d148426865e1.jpg"><br>  <i>Thermal imager and adapter</i> <br><br>  Such an extension cable may be required for the rear camera mode of the android device.  In this mode, the screen is divided into 2 parts, the image from the camera on the right, and the imager on the left.  This is very convenient when it is difficult to distinguish objects from the thermal image and find the right one.  For short distances of 10-30 cm, it is desirable that the lenses are as close as possible to each other.  Otherwise they will look at the object from different angles and the picture will be different. <br><br>  <b>My arsenal</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ed2/1b1/1bd/ed21b11bd14f4d9e8688814e92abcaf5.jpg"><br>  <i>Pyrometers, minipimeters, thermocouple</i> <br><br>  In my arsenal, I have the usual pyrometers, minipimeters, thermocouple.  For measuring a small area of ‚Äã‚Äã2x2 mm, a mini pyrometer is better suited, its diameter is 3.5 mm. <br><br>  <b>Instrument Settings</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c16/acb/9e6/c16acb9e617243f6a7240030519c977f.jpg"><br><br>  The functionality of the <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/seek-thermal-sompact-pro/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dseek-thermal-sompact-pro%26utm_content%3Dseek-thermal-sompact-pro%26utm_campaign%3Dseek-thermal-sompact-pro_721">imager is</a> very different from previous models, greatly expanding the scope of application. <br><br>  The most important setting is the emission factor.  Only predefined options are available, the ability to specify an arbitrary value was not available.  Perhaps this will be fixed in the future in the new application. <br><br>  Possible options: <br><br>  1. matte - 0.97; <br>  2. semi-gloss - 0.80; <br>  3. semi-gloss - 0.60; <br>  4. glossy - 0.30. <br><br>  Depending on the choice will vary.  By lowering the emission factor, you can increase the maximum measured heat.  For example, setting 0.3 instead of 0.9, you can get a maximum of 990 ¬∞ instead of 330 ¬∞.  Then calculate the real value. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bbc/bd4/c04/bbcbd4c04bd246409032f89f1757f6d3.jpg"><br><br>  Temperature can be displayed in 3 options: <br><br>  1. Fahrenheit; <br>  2. Celsius; <br>  3. in kelvins. <br><br>  The aspect ratio of the resulting image can be 4: 3 and 16: 9. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cff/382/147/cff3821479a047d2bb68902716ebbd66.jpg"><br><br>  Additional options: <br><br>  1. you can hide the temperature panel; <br>  2. save information about the location of the image received via GPS; <br>  3. remove Thermal Seek watermarks in the lower right corner; <br>  4. Enable anti-aliasing. <br><br>  <b>Modes of operation</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0e5/557/6dd/0e55576dd15641aeac869413fce1dbf1.jpg"><br><br>  On the red bar are selected modes of operation, from left to right: <br><br>  1. experimental mode, the screen is divided into 2 parts, on the left is the image from the camera of your smartphone or tablet, on the right is thermal imaging; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8d6/349/1b4/8d63491b48724b189cf67c6af3433254.jpg"><br><br>  2. pyrometer mode, temperature measurement only in the center of the screen, a pointing cross appears; <br>  3. the coldest and hottest points are automatically detected with indication of the number of degrees; <br>  4. graphic mode, an indicator appears on the scale not only at the top and bottom, but also in the middle; <br>  5. second graphic mode, more dense marking of the correspondence of colors and degrees; <br>  6. on the right side of the screen, a second scale appears on which the required temperature range is selected, for example, only objects with a range from 41 ¬∞ to 47 ¬∞ are shown. <br>  7. The functionality of the last three modes has not yet been clarified exactly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1f7/cf3/1b2/1f7cf31b2a3b4e67a4305e237ff342f1.jpg"><br><br>  There are 9 gradients for coloring the thermogram, from black and white to rainbow. <br><br>  <b>Examples of measurements</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e40/386/a3e/e40386a3e9b44725a04dd7c58724b02d.jpg"><br>  <i>The battery in the photo turned out great</i> <br><br>  My laboratory specializes in lamps, spotlights, light bulbs and LED car lamps.  As examples I will conduct measurements of various lighting engineering.  Many people will find out how strong xenon and halogens are heated in a car headlight. <br><br>  As an example, temperature measurements will be taken: <br><br>  1. halogen autolamps of a passing beam on 55 W; <br>  2. 35 W xenon, which has a luminous flux of 2,800 lumens; <br>  3. LED autolamps of a passing light on Cree and Philips LEDs; <br>  4. LED car lamps for dimensions; <br>  5. led floodlight; <br>  6. Diode lamp Nanosvet 15 W; <br>  7. powerful led auto light for daytime running lights, DRL. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e5a/c8b/24d/e5ac8b24dd6e41d6825e2e7c4103b878.jpg"><br>  <i>On the street</i> <br><br>  <b>Halogen autolamp</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e0f/53e/e90/e0f53ee900dc47caa49caabcfe337074.jpg"><br><br>  Measurements of a 55 W halogen lamp with an H7 base used in low beam cars.  Measuring range is not enough to fix the maximum.  The result rests on the ceiling at around 330 ¬∞.  Large pyrometer captures 390 ¬∞. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bd3/7d5/091/bd37d5091143494690e9f60b38f4887c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Xenon lamp</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/84b/de6/90b/84bde690b29d478381887e8f06d75ebb.jpg"><br><br>  A standard xenon light bulb with a 35 watt ignition unit is used.  In ordinary glass, the emission factor is about 80. At xenon, special heat-resistant glass with a low emission factor.  The miniprometer showed 275 ¬∞, although not according to its characteristics, a maximum of 220 ¬∞.  A large pyrometer with a working range of up to 400 ¬∞ showed that the range was exceeded, displaying ‚ÄúHi‚Äù on the screen.  Many believe that xenon is not heated, but it is not.  It also burns out reflectors of headlights and lenses as from halogen ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7a1/e5a/a5f/7a1e5aa5f2174303a6a9e02e3be48149.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5ae/42a/ea4/5ae42aea40e94de480f20d06c63aff62.jpg"><br><br>  In the second picture, the emission value was changed, because of this, the picture changed, the spot in the center became grainy.

The number of pixels of the thermal matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe same as that of professional devices, the price is 3-6 times higher.  Adjustable focus will allow you to take thermal imaging of electronic components and multi-storey buildings with equal efficiency.  The minimum shooting distance I got about 7 cm, that is, you can consider the miniature SMD resistors and capacitors on the board.  The USB interface will turn your ordinary Android or iPhone smartphone into a thermal imaging device.  When using the tablet, the usability is improved, already 2-3 people can see the thermal image.  There is a 10% discount on the GT-STPRO promo code for the purchase of a thermal imager for 14 days.
