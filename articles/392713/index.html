But, the experience of the whole world shows us that this did not stop at this - literally every first, more or less significant store in the whole world was involved in this story, and Russia is no exception.  The number of connected stores in the largest cashback services in Russia is already more than 700. And how many online stores do you buy?  And did you know that in all these stores you can return some of the money spent?  We consider the cashback service in detail using the example of the <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/vg">LetyShops</a> company, whose services are already used by more than 3 million people every month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ca/319/ab7/1ca319ab7ac37d555374626b583e54f8.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There are several points in the cashback service that you should pay attention to.  It: <br>  - the percentage of payments (for this they came) <br>  - reliability (confidence that the money will be paid) <br>  - usability (in order not to complicate your life, returning money) <br>  - stability (or else they will close tomorrow?) <br>  - service (nice when they think about your convenience)

      So let's sort through what LetyShops is offering. <br><br><h2>  1. Payout percentage </h2><blockquote>  - at registration, the payout percentage is 30% higher <br>  - the more you buy - the more you return <br></blockquote><br>  LetyShops have already connected more than 730 stores and the cashback percentage in them is certainly the most different.  In some cases, it can reach up to 30%, but as a rule, we are talking about a 5-10% return.  The exact percentage of return depends on many factors, including the financial structure of the store, product margins, the goals of the advertising campaign, and so on.  In any case, the larger the partner, the more the advertiser is ready to give for attracting a client.  That is, our task, as buyers, is to find the largest cashback service and get the most profitable return percentage there. <br><br>  We have already chosen the largest one, and now it‚Äôs not difficult to get a higher payout percentage, since each new user of the system receives a premium account, increasing the payout percentage by 30% for 7 days. <br><br>  And when 7 days are over, you can increase your payout percentage at the expense of new purchases.  That is, if you buy a lot via the Internet, then very soon you will have a constantly <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/loyalyty">increased percentage of payments</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/23e/c74/2ad/23ec742ad856e9f2c9b411338a0cb501.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  2. Reliability </h2><blockquote>  - More than 3 million visits per month <br>  - Hundreds of positive reviews <br>  - Large company at the base </blockquote><br>  Periodically, someone calls me or writes with requests to evaluate the reliability of a particular store, but in fact it‚Äôs not at all difficult.  You need to evaluate its attendance, see reviews, maybe check the date of domain registration and try to find out what people are behind the company. <br><br>  <b>I will show on the example of LetyShops:</b> <b><br></b>  1. Attendance - 3 million visits per month ( <a href="">According to Similarweb</a> ) <br>  2. Reviews - positive (A simple <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fsourceid%3Dchrome-psyapi2%26ion%3D1%26espv%3D2%26ie%3DUTF-8%26q%3DLetyShops%2520%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%26oq%3DLetyShops%2520%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%26aqs%3Dchrome..69i57j0.3384j0j7">request</a> to the search engine and we see excellent characteristics on the largest otzovik sites (otzovik.com and irecommend.ru) <br>  3. Date of registration - 05/29/2014 (look through <a href="https://www.nic.ru/whois/%3Fdomain%3Dletyshops.ru">Whois</a> ).  That is almost 2 years on the market, which is very significant for cashback service. <br>  4. If you have friends in this area, then you can simply ask how the company is doing.  I took an interest and found out that they are included in a holding of one company, whose name I cannot name yet, but I will say that this company made almost 15 billion rubles in 2014, the data for 2015 is not disclosed, but I think there is from 30 to 50 billion turnover .  In general, the problems with money in LetyShops is not exactly foreseen in the near future. <br><br>  In total, the company is about 2 years old, it is rapidly gaining momentum, the reviews are 99% positive and have solid ground under their feet.  So you can definitely trust. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e9b/fd9/6fd/e9bfd96fd111f243703ff201d9d4cc9d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  3. Usability </h2><blockquote>  - Training new users hintami <br>  - Modern design <br>  - Automatic crediting to the account <br></blockquote><br>  It is difficult to call the cashback service an intuitive mechanism, so that the elements of learning are still needed.  After registering at LetyShops, you immediately find yourself in a friendly modern design and of course you immediately read the tips, which in a couple of minutes explain everything easily and then there are almost no questions about how to get your money back for the purchase.  Moreover, the mechanism itself is as automated as possible and the buyer simply has to click on the right link, and the money for the purchase will be credited automatically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57c/052/989/57c0529896269907190dd4a0ca0aaa45.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  4. Stability </h2><blockquote>  - 2 years on the market <br>  - 10 million rubles paid <br>  - stable growth <br></blockquote><br>  No less important is the fact that the company did not appear yesterday and all the reviews are positive, which means that all the years that they have been working honestly fulfill their obligations to customers.  Disputes are promptly resolved if something goes wrong and, judging by the incredible growth, they are doing everything right.  A couple of weeks ago, I showed a screen attendance, there were 2.6 million per month, and today there are already 3 million. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad1/dad/f14/ad1dadf14448d9beba04dfb3c0ac7e12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  5. Service </h2><blockquote>  - more than 730 stores <br>  - Application to the browser, so as not to forget to return the cashback <br>  - Support service available 7 days a week (both in chat and on the phone) <br>  - Quick withdrawal by any method <br>  - Shares that increase cashback 2 times <br></blockquote><br>  No less important is the fact that the company does not only the main feature, but also simplifies the life of the client as much as possible at the expense of other services and actions.  A support every day is ready to answer questions, that is, it works without holidays and weekends.  The guys made a browser application that helps on the whole process of getting money.  ( <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/chromes">More here</a> ) And, of course, this money can be withdrawn in many different ways.  And they also constantly carry out promotions of increased cashback, that is, if you simply register and track - you can get a very decent cashback in the most famous stores.  All promotions can be found in the email-list, so it is almost impossible to miss something interesting. <br><br>  And most importantly, a good cashback service offers purchases not only in one place, but collects hundreds of stores in one place.  This is convenient, because even when I find a new store for myself - I can immediately get an increased cashback there, because they have already connected all the significant companies that sell through the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/adf/386/b63/adf386b635b0c24a512be213b47e247e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  We reviewed the main indicators for analyzing cashback service.  I hope everyone became clear what it is and whether you need it.  I personally add that if we buy gadgets in China, then it is <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/vf">necessary to have a cashback</a> , because the payout percentage on all sites of Chinese online stores is very interesting. <br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.  Do not forget to subscribe to our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/">blog</a> , there will be many more interesting things. <br><br>  ps To hell with money, we put things in order here: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tUEWNRpT39I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392713/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392713/</a></p>
