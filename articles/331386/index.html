We give seven reasons why video content should be included in the marketing strategy, and it‚Äôs better to hurry with this. <br><br>  <b>Transferred to <a href="https://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dvideos-transform-content-marketing">Alconost</a></b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The video captures all the great spaces: today it is both viewing news and chatting with friends.  To understand that the video on the Internet has settled down seriously, just look at how Facebook news has changed in recent years.  The numbers speak for themselves: <a href="http://www.insivia.com/50-must-know-stats-about-video-marketing-2016/">1.5 million Americans watch videos on the Internet</a> , with the average user watching at least <a href="http://www.insivia.com/50-must-know-stats-about-video-marketing-2016/">16 minutes of online video advertising</a> per month.  Both bloggers and businessmen should understand that today without using video <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/296296/">in content marketing strategies, they</a> are nowhere.

      Obviously, the video is now at the peak of its popularity - just look through the tape of any social network.  Take at least YouTube, where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/en-GB/statistics.html">over a billion users</a> , or, for example, Facebook, where the news feed has been redirected <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/274590">to video content</a> : the network promotes its own video functions, including Facebook Live and the choice of the target audience, and now its algorithms will prefer rather one-minute video, than an article for 500 words.  Instagram is also not far behind: it was recently announced that the <a href="http://techstory.in/14042016-insta-update-focuses-videos-compete-fb/">length of the video</a> in the application is increased to one minute. <br><br>  And social networks are not alone: ‚Äã‚Äãmore and more companies and bloggers are realizing the enormous advantages of adding their own videos to the site.  If you have not started posting video content on your website or blog, you should do it - and here's why. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Increase traffic</b></font> </h3><br>  Video, quite simply, increases the traffic coming to the site.  The ratio of the number of clicks to the number of views of an email is <a href="http://www.switchvideo.com/infographic-basic-facts-of-video/">increased by 200‚Äì300%</a> if there is a video in the letter.  It is also shown that if there is a video on the page, then the normal traffic from search engines <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253917">increases by 157%</a> .  It doesn't matter if you promote - a personal blog or your own brand - the video can give the site <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253917">three times as many visitors</a> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Great way to introduce your brand.</b></font> </h3><br>  If a company creates its own brand, the video will play an important role in this: with its help, you will not only give the target audience the information it needs about your own services, product or brand, but also share your interest and inspiration with it. <br><br>  The loyal audience of your blog‚Äôs subscribers is more likely to <a href="https://smartblogger.com/blog-video/">be word of mouth</a> and talk about your blog and how cool you are.  By including video creation in branding events, you will give the audience an opportunity to take a look at ‚Äúyou are real‚Äù, which will build confidence in what you are going to say and offer. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Motivation</b></font> </h3><br>  Video can seriously affect the audience and significantly increase the likelihood that the user, after watching the video, <a href="http://www.insivia.com/50-must-know-stats-about-video-marketing-2016/">will take any action related to it</a> : for example, look for additional information or buy the mentioned product. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.insivia.com/50-must-know-stats-about-video-marketing-2016/">According to studies</a> , video is a very important part of filling the site: almost 60% of respondents say that product videos reinforce the intention to buy, and this reduces the likelihood of return of goods. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Memorability</b></font> </h3><br>  You will be surprised, but the video is remembered better than the text.  Numbers say that <a href="http://www.switchvideo.com/2013/05/16/60-seconds-dollars-and-senses/">we keep in memory only 10% of the read</a> .  And when watching a video, both the auditory and the visual channel for receiving information are used, which increases the memorability <a href="http://www.switchvideo.com/2013/05/16/60-seconds-dollars-and-senses/">to 68%</a> .  And this should push you to create videos that really deserve to be remembered. <br><br>  <i>Translator's note: we somehow even made a video on this topic in Alconost:</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7y6IrUlcy4o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>To attract attention</b></font> </h3><br>  Businessmen and bloggers know how difficult it is to stand out among the rest.  The reality is that few companies have enough creative abilities to <a href="http://www.intechnic.com/blog/ten-benefits-of-adding-custom-video-to-your-website/">present</a> their brand and their products or services <a href="http://www.intechnic.com/blog/ten-benefits-of-adding-custom-video-to-your-website/">vividly and vividly</a> on the site.  If you keep up with the times and decide on sincerity in communicating with the target audience, and also remember the importance of creating <a href="https://problogger.com/how-to-beat-your-competition-online-by-trying-this-one-thing/">exciting and interesting content</a> , you will have a serious advantage. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Videos easy to share</b></font> </h3><br>  Sharing video content is becoming easier, so a creative and memorable video will cover more people than any text could cover.  The length of time in which the video is loaded is crucial: it is noticed that many Youtube videos are <a href="http://www.rendrfx.com/video-marketing-statistics">embedded, linked and distributed</a> on Tuesday between 11:00 and 13:00.  Creating a "catchy" and a dull movie, you provide future traffic without making much effort.  Thanks to the video, one click can easily turn into a hundred. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Video continues to gain popularity</b></font> </h3><br>  Video content has been present in the media space for some time, but now it is becoming more and more interesting and attractive, so it is clear that in the near future we will not get away from the video.  According to forecasts, by 2019 <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/326944/">80% of all Internet traffic</a> will be streaming video. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Summary</b></font> </h3><br>  This year has shown us that the video is becoming a familiar tool for marketers, bloggers, businessmen and almost everyone who wants to attract the attention of the audience to their site.  By creating your own video, you can be sure that after its publication you will immediately receive traffic, audience interest and much more.  By incorporating video into your content marketing strategy, you gain many benefits, so there is no reason to postpone - it's time to take on video content! <br><br><br>  <b>About the translator</b> <br><br>  The article is translated in Alconost. <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dvideos-transform-content-marketing">localization of applications, games and websites</a> in 68 languages.
