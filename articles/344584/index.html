  <section class="page js-page"><h1>When Bitcoin stops growing: tokens are a real alternative to Coin</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  While Hip around Bitcoin is gaining incredible heights, ever more strongly resembling modern fever in modern gold, it's time to look into the future: what can replace Bitcoin itself?  The correct answer to this question is the purchase of tokens, that is, the second most attractive route to enrichment on cryptocurrencies, by itself, after the invention of the time machine and the journey into the past for bitcoins of a few cents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rp/r_/h9/rpr_h9cgfefcoobu2xrk9cycfu4.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Not bitcoin one </h3><br>  The head of Sberbank, German Gref, recently announced that he had bought bitcoins in his time.  Sberbank itself has been studying the potential of cryptocurrency and the blockchain for several years now and sees a crypt (not to be confused with crypto) a great future.  The Winklevoss Twins, famous for their litigation with Mark Zuckerberg for Facebook rights, became billionaires thanks to cryptocurrency.  A few years ago, they spent $ 11 million to buy bitcoins (then they cost about $ 120 per coin, wow), which have since increased many times in price against the dollar, and Pavel Durov's 2,000 bitcoins <a href="https://ru.insider.pro/topnews/2017-12-12/pavel-durov-zarabotal-na-bitkoine-35-mln/">are</a> now <a href="https://ru.insider.pro/topnews/2017-12-12/pavel-durov-zarabotal-na-bitkoine-35-mln/">valued</a> at $ 35 million. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now everyone is excited by the growth of Bitcoin.  But this process has its dark side.  The rapid growth of the cost of cryptocurrency number 1 causes problems for altcoins.  The fact is that the current capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is relatively small on the scale of the financial world - about $ 480 billion. Two thirds of them accounted for the capitalization of Bitcoin only, and its share is growing - because the cryptorok in general cannot grow at the same rate as Bitcoin so, with its growth, it ‚Äúdries‚Äù other currencies.  The latter in the process lose the potential investors who are massively invested in Bitcoin.  As an example, we can compare the dynamics of the course of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past six months:

And scary. <br><br><h3>  Tokens - An Alternative to Coin </h3><br>  Tokens are smart contracts issued by various cryptocurrency companies, the sale of which should finance their projects in exchange for bonuses and chips for token holders.  The ICO series - tokens' public offerings - became the second most powerful cryptograph of the year after the growth of Bitcoin.  Unlike other cryptomonet, tokens are provided not with speculative interest, but with specific assets - material or digital, existing or planned - of the issuing company.  The ICO boom did not arise from scratch: some companies that successfully completed it have already grown incredibly, becoming the "unicorns" of business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/md/r7/1j/mdr71jncejos4mdaxwdhy0izskk.png"><br><br>  "Unicorns" are called companies, the capitalization of which reached $ 1 billion. And among them more and more of those who most recently spent ICO.  This, for example, the company OmiseGO (OMG).  At the time of ICO, the company‚Äôs tokens were worth $ 0.27.  Now the price of OMG (not to be confused with OMFG) has already reached $ 11.  This means that the course has grown more than 40 times.  In turn, this means that the company that conducted the ICO has become a ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù.  The project itself is engaged in the provision of financial services.  OmiseGO is an Ethereum based publicly available financial technology designed for use in ordinary digital wallets.  It allows you to combine currency exchange and payment services in real time, which are located in different jurisdictions and organizational repositories for both fiat and decentralized cryptocurrencies. <br><br>  The same can be said about Qtum, whose tokens at the time of launch cost $ 0.30, and a few weeks after the completion of the ICO reached a rate of $ 17.  The company is engaged in combining the Bitcoin protocol with Ethereum technology.  The open source project integrates the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) with the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide">Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)</a> table of unspent bitcoin outputs and plans to provide smart contracts for companies around the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0c/y2/kg/0cy2kgaqmxpo5ibv3chhapy7ntu.png"><br><br>  There are other tokens, the price of which has increased many times since the ICO. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dg/2j/oz/dg2jozdkznambhm5qdjhhfynrbk.png"><br><br>  In line for them, as I want to think, there is another project that released their tokens and is preparing for a massive crowdsale in January 2018.  In the Hamster Marketplace ecosystem, tokens are not only a crowdfunding tool, but also an important element of the future decentralized management mechanism through the blockchain.  However, at first the HMT functions on the Hamster will be more utilitarian: tokens will be required as the main means of payment between the manufacturers represented on the platform and the site itself.  With the help of HMT will be paid, for example, the tools of internal promo - priority display in search results, promotional blocks and banners, the creation of surveys and other features. <br><br>  As in the case of other successful projects, Hamster Marketplace tokens are provided not with speculative, but with real business: decentralized trade in niche gadgets, inventions and DIY electronics from all over the world without intermediaries.  Participating in the <a href="https://hmstr.io/">Hamster Marketplace crowdsale</a> is a great opportunity to support a good project and IT brothers, both collecting cool pieces of iron ‚Äúin the garage‚Äù, and designing boards of a new, beautiful electronics that should be available to everyone.  And tokens in general - are a very attractive alternative to cryptocurrency now. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344584/</a></p>
