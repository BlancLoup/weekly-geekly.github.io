Why is it possible?  The fact is that in consultation with endocrinologists, not all of them were aware of this sugar substitute, so we‚Äôll tell you briefly. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cf4/687/cdf/cf4687cdf2fc4e70b2112ecc213c40a9.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Faced with type 1 diabetes in private life, of course, I had to go for some restrictions.  In Russia, mainly from sweeteners recommend Stevia.  It is easy to find, it seems to be recognized as the best natural sweetener because of the smooth effect on the level of sugar and less calories. <br><br>  They do not recommend fructose, because it is not a sugar substitute, but one of the natural sugars.  Urge to be careful with maltitol, because it has a delayed effect.  Say, the chocolate on maltose will give nothing at once, then you eat another piece - and again nothing, and after 50 minutes it can cover you ...

      But this is all the lyrics.  To the fact that with an abundance of recommendations on sugar substitutes about erythritol in endocrinology, you hear less often.  Or do not hear at all.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythritol">Erythritol</a> - sugar alcohol, which in Russia is sold in ‚Äúcrystalline form‚Äù - as usual sugar, and in the form of syrups, and as part of carbohydrate sweets. <br><br>  It is proved that neither diabetics nor <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8039489">healthy people</a> it does not cause side effects and does not affect the glycemic index, in other words: it does not increase sugar.  At the same time, it tastes sweet enough in its pure form with no obvious aftertastes. <br><br>  According to my feelings: there is something like a cooling effect, if there is a spoonful of crystals.  As part of the syrup no discomfort in the mouth, even the cooling effect.  In the composition of carbohydrate-free sweets behaves differently.  For example, in carbon-free meringues it seemed that there was a slight astringent effect.  In the low-carb candies "Cow" - this was not. <br><br>  Erythritol as a dietary supplement (despite the fact that it <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4995183/">is considered a</a> non-food sweetener) is approved by the medical community of the European Union, approved by the FDA, however, they estimate its caloric content a little differently: the FDA assigns 0.2 k / gram, the European Union - 0. Erythritis is not only considered as a safe sugar for diabetics, but also as a non-nutritive sugar in principle: for those who follow the figure, is engaged in fitness, etc. <br><br>  It is also being studied in dentistry, finding sorbitol for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5011233/">oral hygiene</a> rather than classic xylitol.  And in some other areas, including botany as a means of getting rid of some pests! <br><br>  Products known to me, which include erythritol and what was really eaten, such as: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A photo</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fba/2a1/7ed/fba2a17ed0694ab3851f3bb2500f1bec.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/23a/84f/2eb/23a84f2eb8f94966a75063228e7727a8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e8b/55e/944/e8b55e9440de4ddf8978143a840508cc.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  Brands that are familiar: Exscess Free, Fit Parad.  The latter, for example, can be found in retail islets in shopping centers, but there is a nuance: you should look at the composition, since from the front side it is usually written ‚ÄúBased on natural ingredients‚Äù.  And from the backside: ‚ÄúAs part of erythritol.‚Äù <br><br>  In general, for those who have problems with the level of sugar, or are familiar with similar problems, I recommend erythritol for studying, but it is better to write right in English, because we write about it only for advertising purposes and this is not very informative. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403991/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403991/</a></p>
