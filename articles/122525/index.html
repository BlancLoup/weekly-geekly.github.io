We bring to your attention a new model of the electronic book Lbook V60.  We have long been waiting for the release of this device.  Here is the official <a href="http://muk-ua.livejournal.com/11376.html">announcement</a> , as well as the most detailed and most valuable <a href="http://www.slovary.ru/ab_translater.php%3Fsec%3DArticle%26art%3D15">review of the</a> device.  We will not repeat, under the habrokat explanatory note from the manufacturer illustrated with photographs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da7/335/210/da7335210dd02c0bd393630ca20a464e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Here is the actual device

Good or bad, time will tell and operating experience.  So far, only the best impressions, especially in terms of the stability and convenience of porting applications and the development of the software interface. <br><br>  So it sounded the main word "interface".  The device control interface is not very clear.  When developing it, we wanted to achieve the following goals: <br>  - make maximum use of graphic icons and a minimum of text, this minimizes the time spent on localizing the device (now, in the device software, you can find almost 4 dozen localization options) <br>  - to control the interface to use the programmable function buttons F1-F5 <br>  - standardize the management interface for all device applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40b/e39/171/40be39171c8e65f7f98eb4abf9e04c46.jpg"><br>  You can flip through with your left hand. <br><br>  You can flip through with your right hand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0db/47d/d9b/0db47dd9b0377cdf0238ad426e225dcb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We think we should say a few words about the case cover.  Remembering old troubles, this time we approached this issue very seriously.  A super cover was applied to the front panel with the property of repelling grease and dirt.  So, white lovers can not worry about the virginal purity of their favorite book - there are no fingerprints left - it is always white and beautiful.  This is guaranteed.  In combination with a contrasting Pearl screen, the white version of the book looks very attractive.  For fans of the ‚Äúblack‚Äù version there will be a device with a dark asphalt surface, ‚Äúal-I Kindle‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f8/cc3/302/8f8cc33021825b426848cf959245aea3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The reverse side of the device is covered with a soft-touch coating - because of which the device can be pleasantly and firmly held in the hands. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/173/be8/099/173be8099820f2e63c10a7d4f2b8e986.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The book is equipped with two high-quality micro speakers, it provides quite comfortable listening to audio books in difficult traveling conditions.  A joke, of course, but who knows, maybe someone will come in handy.  For example, bedtime stories for children on vacation, scroll. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94c/3b7/44e/94c3b744e34334fdcbf2d46562d43f54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Open the lid <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1d/fc9/25b/c1dfc925b6761a723d27ae15f5828eb0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can put the 3G module.  There is also a button to turn off the battery to the left, if, for example, you want to turn off the device for a long time, then to prevent the battery from discharging, this switch physically disconnects the battery contacts. <br><br>  Keyboard V60 consists of 5 programmable function buttons F1-F5, located directly below the screen.  Standard alphanumeric set of QWERTY and 4-button joystick.  The buttons are perfectly made, reliable and convenient to use.  Unfortunately, due to the lack of sufficient space under the buttons, we did not label 4 Ukrainian letters.  But, with certain skills, this, we hope, will not cause great difficulties when typing in Ukrainian, these characters are in their ‚Äúusual‚Äù place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e5/866/f5f/0e5866f5fbd481499a201c225c2dbe70.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In contrast to the ‚Äúkeyboard‚Äù books of Chinese competitors, in the V60, the keyboard is quite functional and is not a decorative design element for a greater resemblance to Kindl.  We tried to make using the keyboard as logical and simple as possible.  There is only one related combination of Shift + Alt for switching layouts.  In all other cases, just one click of a button.  From the interface of V3 shifted the use of long button presses.  But here we tried not to overdo it. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b3/7dc/c4e/2b37dcc4e3c95876f49fb27d68d0b57a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The e-book is clicked off the cover.  Left small button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/657/bfa/7a1/657bfa7a1240fb01255a8827584de632.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device supports RSS feeds. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b87/cfc/abe/b87cfcabe339e9243eb7c1f57664f158.jpg" alt="image"><br>  PCC can be configured to load: a) headers only;  b) titles and annotations;  c) headlines and the whole body of the article.  Very convenient - somewhere connected to WI-FI, downloaded RSS and read in the subway <br><br>  There is a full built-in mail client.  You can even customize spam filters on it. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b01/5f2/4a8/b015f24a8172604286e1a8a09b29d7bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Wi-Fi works as it should - WebKit-based internet browser <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c51/e1d/baf/c51e1dbaf8c3ce3478c8362cb2055bdc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to the use of the database, we got practically a built-in virtual library: five types of sorting, search by book title, author, book series, display of book or file names, developed tools for working with files and folders.  In combination with an external librarian program, this gives an excellent result.  Metadata on the file is displayed - when it shows the name of the file (below it the name of the book, the author, etc.) in small print.  This made it much easier to work with book files (especially FB2).  And plus to this, you can sort files / books in alphabetical order AZ / ZA or AZ / ZA - the first button in the menu.  In our plans to make a synchronization module with an external library.  But, so far there is no definitive solution how to best implement it and who needs it at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e8/d72/ceb/0e8d72ceb87d6ec4274e6ee54b1376ae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first button is sorting the files that were mentioned.  The second button is a file search, the 3rd button with an arrow is a search inside a file (select the required one in the file list and go directly to the required page).  Button to switch between the SD card and the built-in memory and settings.  The program of the file manager "Bookshelf" also did not avoid the "changes".  Externally, it differs little from a similar application in V3 / V5.  The main external difference of the "Bookshelf" is only that the screen displays 10 positions instead of 8, as before. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5a/5e5/dd4/f5a5e5dd4f769de6dd8eed564644e967.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second menu.  The first button to switch between books and files.  The second button (open / closed eye) is to show / hide system files, select a language, select a font (which can be uploaded), adjust the screen. <br><br>  There are also 5 personal user profiles.  Each profile has 18 settings - from font size, screen layout and text indents, to line and line spacing. <br><br>  In our opinion, we were able to make a fully functional interface.  Yes, the user will have to first look at the manual to the book more than once, but after a few days, the need for this will disappear.  Tested on a dozen test users and even 3 blondes.  So, we ask novice users to bravely endure the first shock and believe in a happy near future.  Everything will be fine.  Moreover, the entire interface is designed so that all the basic functions are available at the first level, and all the ‚Äúfine‚Äù settings are removed ‚Äúin depth‚Äù and do not interfere with the work with the book for novice users. <br><br>  I would also like to mention the redesigned screen driver.  You will immediately see this by the speed of updating pages and the quality of drawing fonts. <br><br>  Brief technical data: <br><br>  Screen: 6 ‚Ä≥ E-Ink Pearl, 600 √ó 800 px, 16 grayscale <br>  Processor: 400 MHz Samsung ARM9 <br>  Operating system: Linux OS 2.6 <br>  Built-in memory: 2 GB <br>  Expansion slot: SD up to 16GB <br>  Switching: USB 2.0, WiFi 802.11a / b / g, 3G (optional) <br>  Text formats: FB2, EPUB, PDF, DOC, DJVU, RTF, TXT, HTML, PPT <br>  Graphic Formats: BMP, JPG, PNG, GIF, TIF <br>  Audio formats: MP3 <br>  Audio: 3.5mm headphone <br>  Battery: Lithium Ion 1600mAh <br>  Dimensions: 185.2 x 124.6 x 10.9 mm <br>  Weight: 240 gr.
