However, the clumsiness of the methods used in blocking leads to the fact that the Wiki, which has been using the HTTPS protocol for quite some time, falls under the whole block, instead of restricting access to a separate page of the site. <br><br>  It happened this time.  The regulator represented by Roskomnadzor spotted on the Wiki page with another extremist text, recognized as such by a court decision back in 2010.  This is the text ‚ÄúProtocols of the Elders of Zion‚Äù, which was entered into the register of prohibited information as of July 26, 2010, by decision of the Leninsky District Court of the city of Orenburg.

Stanislav Kozlovsky, executive director of the Wikimedia RU, responded to the situation in his twitter in the following way: <br><br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ru" data-twitter-extracted-i1551430330553874446="true"><p lang="ru" dir="ltr">  Roskomnadzor made to the Registry Wikisource.  In addition to it, Wikipedia, which has the same IP, can be under attack.

In 2010, Wikipedia was not a party to the case, and the court did not consider any claims about the work itself.  The extremist brochure was recognized, in which, apparently, besides the work, there were some anti-Semitic appeals to Jewish pogroms.  Therefore, the community is not obliged to comply with the unlawful demand of the department. <br>  The main issue in such cases is the limitation period of requirements for the execution of court decisions.  In this regard, the blocking legislation is somehow out of the general principles of the civil process.  The enforcement of court decisions is the task of enforcement proceedings.  To this end, the law provides for a general three-year statute of limitations for filing an application of this kind. <br>  At least, if Roskomnadzor, bypassing the bailiffs, makes court decisions directly from the courts to enforce them without requesting the writ of execution, in any case, the law should be applied by analogy with the calculation of the 3-year time limit for submission.  Otherwise, soon we will be able to see the judicial acts of the Soviet courts, submitted to execution, which, by the way, no one has also canceled. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Apparently, someone missed the resonant reports of blocking the main Internet encyclopedia of the planet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396443/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396443/</a></p>
