And, of course ... rejoice for Leo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c40/402/bee/c40402bee7274810a11c72093abad957.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For us, as for the telephone sales service team, the most iconic film with Leo was ‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street‚Äù, shot according to the memoirs of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker with a fate as cool as a roller coaster.  Thanks to the talent of persuasion at the age of 24, he became a millionaire, but, stepping on a crooked path, at 35 he lost everything.  We walked over kilometers of interviews with Belfort and made a brief guide to successful sales. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A person trusts you - 10 points

      A person trusts your company - 10 points <br><br>  Man loves your product - 10 points <br><br>  TRANSACTION BE! <br><br>  <b>How to earn credibility?</b> <br><br>  So, the first condition: you must be trusted.  This means that you have to transmit confidence to customers during the sale.  Your confident and calm tonality is about 45% of success.  It is the voice that forms trust.  Body language is also important in telephone sales, despite the fact that the client does not see you.  This is another 45% of success.  But the words that you say - oddly enough, only 10% of success. <br><br><blockquote>  In sales, <b>what‚Äôs</b> important is not <b>what</b> you say, but <b>how</b> you say it. </blockquote><br><br>  Confidence comes from a person who is fluent in product information.  Therefore, Belfort says: ‚ÄúYou have to become an expert in your product!‚Äù And recommends that you come up with five different ways to present your goods.  It should be really different stories with different selection of words. <br><br>  Trust arises when the buyer is not in a sales car for bonuses at the end of the month, but a real person with his own story.  Therefore, Belfort advises, do not hesitate to say a few words about yourself.  Remember your attempts to talk to a girl on the street.  She turns away and says that she does not communicate with strangers.  To this, an experienced pikaper immediately answers: ‚ÄúI am Jordan.  Here I am no longer a stranger. ‚Äù  Add a couple of facts about yourself, and the girl smiles, ready to continue flirting. <br><br>  People are more likely to come into contact and trust more to the person with whom they have something in common, such as a hobby, musical preferences or even the same pets.  Let the client know that you are ‚Äúon the same wavelength‚Äù - if he calls to consult, for example, about a vacuum cleaner, tell me that a relative you bought the same model a month ago after the most picky choice and is very pleased now. <br><br>  <b>How to share with the client love for the product?</b> <br><br>  First of all, you need to convince yourself that you are selling the really best product.  And then, fall in love with the client in your product.  It is necessary to convince him in two ways. <br><br>  At first - by logic: ‚ÄúMy product is the ideal ratio of price and quality‚Äù. <br><br>  Then - feelings. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSuppose I want to sell Ferrari,‚Äù Belfort explains.  - First, I will talk about the five-year warranty, about the service, about prestige.  This is the logical, rational part of the sale.  Then go to the feelings.  I will definitely give a test drive, put a person in the car and say: ‚ÄúAnd in a year, imagine, you are driving in Monte Carlo with this beauty in this car,‚Äù I create a positive image of the future with my product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27e/d10/17e/27ed1017e1d34810b5efd20ab47ae496.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  - Absolutely without logic.  You will flood the client about a happy future, and his brain will pulsate: "Fuck ... bullshit ..." You need to start a conviction with logical arguments. <br><br>  But what about those who always find objections?  Belfort offers to send a virus into their dark program.  ‚ÄúI myself am telling him the negative scenario‚Äú What will happen if everything goes bad ‚Äù, so that the person turned in his head not his bad film, but mine.  And then, as if by chance, I switch to the advantages of a good script.  And I open a new, happy world to a person, which he will enter by purchasing my goods, ‚Äùthe‚Äú wolf ‚Äùfrom Wall Street will conclude. <br><br>  When we talk about feelings, their description always requires emotional colors and possession of intonation.  Belfortu is credited with the richest range of intonation.  When he describes the product, he lowers his voice, as if it is scary secret information and he is afraid that someone else will hear it.  Before reporting important information, it slows down speech.  His voice becomes very quiet. <br><br><blockquote>  This is a great rule: to talk about important things quietly - then a person begins to listen more attentively. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>How to grow trust in your company?</b> <br><br>  Your company is the team and the product that it creates.  Belfort is sure that if you correctly explain why to people, they will always find a way how.  Therefore, he does not regret the time for explanations, which are more like motivational speeches or sermons with a crowd beating in ecstasy.  With his sincerity he infects the staff, and that in turn - the customers.  The seller must communicate sincerely: ‚ÄúListen, I do not hide anything from you.  Of the goods you need, there are five pieces left in stock.  I know that he interested you the other day.  And calling to warn: have time.  The next delivery will be in six months. ‚Äù  In addition, it drives the customer to make a purchase decision, he understands that the product is in good demand, which means quality. <br><br>  The most famous salesman in the world warns young people against dealing with conscience: ‚ÄúWell, of course, sales alone are not evil.  Sales turn this world.  Nothing happens until something is sold.  The main question is how ethical sales are?  For me, everything is very simple.  If the seller puts his own benefits and interests above the interests of the person whom he convinces, this is called crossing the line of ethics in sales. ‚Äù <br><br>  At <a href="https://pozvonim.com/">Pozvonim.com,</a> we <a href="https://pozvonim.com/">stand in</a> solidarity with Jordan and support more experienced and wise salespeople to have the opportunity to control the quality of the communication of their young wards with calling customers.  Therefore, in our system there is a very useful option for recording conversations made through a callback widget.  The heads of sales departments can not only track the belief system of their sellers, but also adjust it, suggesting the best scenarios for closing deals, as Jordan Belfort did. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f1/bd0/a09/0f1bd0a09ebd4fb098391eef8d62c6f6.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299072/</a></p>
