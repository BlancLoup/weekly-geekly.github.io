Yes!  Two full years since launch. <br>  Fruitful, partly funny, tense, but not fully productive years. <br>  In the bottom line, we have several tens of thousands of registrations and about 18 thousand of actually confirmed and completed profiles of the Contractors and Customers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To date, 1603 moderated orders, some of which, unfortunately, remained without performers. <br><br>  Before launching the project, we made ambitious plans to reach 1000 orders per month.  This is about 30-35 orders per day.  Excellent result ... would be, but for now we have an order of magnitude fewer orders.  But if you want to receive a translation, order copywriting or find a tutor for a particular language, then you definitely should <a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/projects/check"><u>create an order</u></a> on our platform.

      Most ordered translation services.  Expected, dominated by Russian, English, German, Spanish.  Also many people order copywriting, but in Russian.  In other languages, there are very few copywriting orders. <br><br>  If someone is following our project, he will remember that initially there was the role of a guide who, in the language of a tourist, could have an excursion in a certain city.  At a certain stage of our project, this role was turned off, since users perceived the concept of ‚Äúlanguage guide‚Äù as difficult to perceive, and the focus of our resource is precisely on solving language problems and overcoming language barriers.  We did not refer to tourist guides, therefore this role was turned off. <br><br>  The role of the translator was eventually divided into written translations (translator) and oral (interpreter).  Were introduced vacancies, their publication on a fee basis.  Fully demanded feature. <br><br>  It is noticed that users from the CIS have some post-Soviet habits, most of the customers are not ready to pay for the service of the service, perceiving almost any service, not only ours, as something "communist and free by its nature." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24e/b33/bc6/24eb33bc6975db077e6f2b3648fab472.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the same time, users from the UK, Germany, the Czech Republic and even Poland have perfectly demonstrated their willingness to pay for the service.  It is quite probable that, in addition to the low cost of services by their standards, they have a developed culture of payment for the services provided, including the services of the guarantor of security of transactions. <br><br>  During the existence of the service, we have made a certain pivot (reversal) development strategy.  The service has remained an excellent thematic platform for searching for performers (translators, copywriters, tutors).  But in 2016, we focused on the work on the B2B2C system - working with services (business) for their clients. <br><br>  A vivid example is the provision of copywriting services or translations through plug-ins to ready-made site management systems (CMS), such as Wordpress, Joomla, Opencart, etc., where the client can order and, most importantly, receive translation or text directly to your site, without attracting content manager for this and not spending your own time to post the received materials. <br><br>  We parted with more than 320 translation bureaus from different countries, accumulated a certain base of translation directions, with an understanding of the cost of professional translation services for various topics, including narrowly thematic areas. <br><br>  Developed API for partners, you can integrate with other systems.  But the integration process is not as fast.  Due to both software and various legal and logical inconsistencies between different platforms. <br><br>  We continue to develop this area, and we will be grateful if there are enthusiasts among the readers to help us improve the product or possible future partners.  All interested, please write to the mail ceo@2polyglot.com. <br><br><h3>  What awaits us next? </h3><br>  Work, a lot of work.  Growth in the number of performers, growth in the number of customers, improvement of the platform software, partnership with other services, so that each side will receive only a win. <br><br>  In the course of work, we turn to our partners, including the Internet marketing agency <a href="https://bbukva.com/">Bolshaya Bukva</a> , software development company <a href="https://v-jet.net/">V-Jet</a> , a number of publications and websites providing information support, for which they are very grateful. <br><br>  But most of all <b>we are grateful to you - our Artists, Customers, Customers and Partners</b> . <br>  Continue to order the necessary services on the platform 2polyglot.com, and we will make every effort to ensure that your orders are completed on time, with proper quality and safe for any party! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328746/</a></p>
