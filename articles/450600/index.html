reverse side of the moon‚Äù channel, a separate and special repeater satellite is needed for communication. <br><br>  With the help of the repeater satellite it was planned to perform the tasks: <br><br>  - to organize (the first in the world) data channel "the reverse side of the moon &lt;-&gt; Earth"; <br><br>  - to organize tracking of the ‚ÄúChang'e-4‚Äù descent vehicle and data transfer when the vehicle performs lunar maneuvers and landing procedures on the reverse side of the Moon; <br><br>  - transfer to the MCC on Earth the full control of the vehicles (Chang'e-4 module and Yuyuta-2 rover) lowered to the back side of the Moon using the tracking, telemetry and control command transfer subsystem (TT &amp; C - tracking, telemetry and command subsystem) ; <br><br>  - to receive scientific data independently on separate communication channels from the descent module "Chang'e-4" and the rover "Yuyu-2", to send this data to the MCC on Earth; <br><br>  - to conduct their own scientific experiments (using an onboard low-frequency spectrometer) and transfer the obtained scientific data to the PCO on Earth; <br><br>  - carry out shooting on the onboard camera of outer space and transmit photos to the MCC on Earth; <br><br>  - maintain the data transmission channel ‚Äúthe reverse side of the Moon-Earth‚Äù in a working mode for at least 5 years after the start of the satellite‚Äôs operation in orbit beyond the Moon (the maximum estimated service life is up to 10 years); <br><br>  - the software and hardware of the satellite is designed to work with the equipment not only for one Chang'e-4 project, since the life of the Chang'e-4 descent module is one year, and the Yuuta-2 rover is designed to work for three months , but almost doubled this time already, so after the end of the Chang'e-4 project, the satellite repeater will be further involved in new research and for organizing communication channels with new devices on the back of the Moon. <br><br>  <b>Decision</b> <br><br>  A unique satellite repeater satellite was developed, which was planned to be put into halo-orbit around the special gravitationally stable Lagrange point Earth-Moon L2, from which it will maintain direct visibility with the Earth and the back of the Moon at any time, withstanding a temperature difference of 300 degrees Celsius. <br><br>  The engineers of the Chinese Academy of Space Technology (CAST) had only 30 months to develop a repeater satellite. <br><br>  In December 2015, design work began, two years later, the final satellite prototype was produced, which, after testing and testing, was prepared for launch into outer space. <br><br>  The space communications team worked together with a group of scientists and engineers who developed and implemented lunar vehicles for the Chang'e-4 project ‚Äî the Chang'e-4 landing module and the Yuytu-2 rover, the link with which was the main task of their project. <br><br>  For 2015, the team of space engineers and communications engineers of the Chinese Academy of Space Technology already had experience in the development of satellites, remote space communications equipment and control of lunar spacecraft: <br><br><ul><li>  On November 7, 2007, the first Chinese lunar satellite, Chang'e-1, was launched; </li><li>  On October 1, 2010, the Chang'e-2 research satellite was launched, which until July 9, 2011, worked in lunar orbit, and then left it, in 77 days to reach the Lagrange point L2 of the Sun-Earth system (1.5 million kilometers from Earth) for scientific experiments; </li><li>  the landing module "Chang'e-3" and the rover "Yuytu", which were successfully planted on the visible side of the moon on December 14, 2013, and the landing module "Chang'e-3" still communicates with the MCC on Earth. </li></ul><br>  However, the communications engineers of the Chinese Academy of Space Technology had a hard deadline, the launch time of the repeater satellite and its launch into the working orbit could not be disrupted, because in any emergency or abnormal operation of the satellite elements - the launch of the Chang'e 4 spacecraft with the lunar rover "Yuytu-2" on the reverse side of the moon would be impossible in the planned period, postponed or even canceled. <br><br>  In general, the year 2018 was very tense with the Chinese space communications operators. <br><br>  But they did it all - a 425-kilogram repeater satellite called ‚ÄúTseyutsyao‚Äù (in translation - ‚ÄúShorter bridge‚Äù) in the Chinese Academy of Space Technologies was designed, produced at its own facilities (even engineers from the Netherlands were connected for a joint scientific additional load - installation of a special low-frequency telescope-spectrometer on the satellite repeater) and launched at the appointed time and with full functionality. <br><br>  The CAST-100 platform from the Chinese Academy of Space Technologies was used to create the Tseuqiao satellite transponder, and the <a href="http://cast.cn/Item/list.asp%3Fid%3D1814">specialists of the Chinese company DFH Satellite Co., Ltd</a> were involved in its design and production.  (DFHSat), which works closely with CAST and is owned by China Spacesat. <br><br>  <u>Satellite platform CAST-100 includes:</u> <br><br><ul><li>  three-axis stabilization system, navigation control system, thermal control system; </li><li>  a single-component power unit with 100 kg of anhydrous cesium fuel (hydrazine), with a total load of 130H (newtons), 12 engines ‚Äî 8 engines of 5H (two for each of the lower sides of the cube) and central 4 engines of 20N; </li><li>  the power supply system of the on-board systems consisting of two solar batteries (the maximum output power of the solar battery is about 800 W) with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3.8 m2 and a high-energy lithium-ion battery pack of 45A / h. </li></ul><br>  The total weight of the satellite transponder is 425 kg, it has a cuboid shape with a size of 1.4 m √ó 1.4 m √ó 0.85 m, its body consists of an aluminum honeycomb sandwich structure. <br><br>  <u>The following systems were added to the CAST-100 satellite platform as a payload (primary and secondary):</u> <br><br>  1) The main load is a radio repeater. <br><br>  The radio repeater system of the Tseutqiao satellite transponder operates in the X-band and in the S-band. <br><br>  X-band is used to communicate with the landing module "Chang'e-4" and the rover "Yuytu-2" - four channels are organized with a data transfer rate: <br><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúRover \ Landing Module &lt;-&gt; Repeater Satellite‚Äù direction 256-280 kilobits / s; </li><li>  ‚ÄúSatellite Repeater &lt;-&gt; Rover \ Landing Module‚Äù direction is 125 bps. </li></ul><br>  S-band is used to transmit data to Earth - one channel is organized with a data transfer rate of 2 megabits / s. <br><br>  TTC &amp; C telemetry data (USB + VLBI) is transmitted at a speed of 1000/2048 bps. <br><br>  The structure of the radio repeater includes a unique parabolic antenna with a diameter of 4.2 meters, which opens up like an umbrella after the relay satellite enters the working orbit. <br><br>  2) additional load: <br><br><ul><li>  The Netherlands Low Frequency Experimental Radio Telescope (NCLE) with three five-meter antennas, with which the low-frequency radio emission of the early Universe will be recorded to study its structure; </li><li>  a wide-angle laser reflector for measuring the distance between the spacecraft and the ground station, developed by Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong Province in southern China and will be used to conduct the longest distance measurement in the world using a laser between a satellite-transponder and an observatory on Earth;

Therefore, the engineers had to find a balance between the bandwidth of the communication channel, the dynamic change in the positions of the three vehicles (satellite, landing module and rover), as well as the power control system of the radio repeater. <br><br>  The optimal working scheme for them was as follows: telemetry data is transmitted at any distance from the devices on the surface to the repeater satellite, but the transfer of scientific data (large amounts of data) is organized when the orientation of the two devices (satellite-rover or satellite-landing module) is relatively stable and the power of all devices is enough to organize a channel with the necessary bandwidth. <br><br>  For example, Yuytu-2 rover antennas need to be configured so that they point to a satellite repeater in order to correctly send and receive control signals, while the rover‚Äôs solar panels must be optimally tilted to get a lot of sunlight on them, so that maximize power generation at the time of the data transfer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3bc/a73/384/3bca733849fc7d6e2bf00ef4d8bc04bd.gif"><br><br>  In the shoulder of the communication channel ‚ÄúSatellite Repeater &lt;-&gt; MCC on Earth‚Äù, after a satellite retransmitter reaches a halo orbit around the Lagrange point L2 of the Earth-Moon system, the accuracy of the guidance of the relay antenna (distance 4800000 km) is performed. <br><br>  In the process of calibration, the repeater antenna of the repeater satellite was sent to the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  From Earth, the signal is monitored using a 65-meter ground antenna.  The test results show that a high gain relay antenna has a pointing deviation of less than 0.1 ¬∞, which meets the requirements for this project. <br><br>  The satellite relay conducts a daily self-test of its systems ‚Äî checks key functions and performance indicators (RF modulation characteristics, acquisition time, transfer delay, and data format) of the relay system.  Test results are sent to the PCO on Earth, where they are analyzed for compliance with design requirements. <br><br>  Calibration and testing is necessary because, for a satellite transponder located in a working halo orbit, due to thermal deformation and other factors, the actual orbital orientation of the relay communication antenna will have deflection variations that need to be corrected and checked for changes. <br><br>  The calculated thermal deformation of the antenna elements (in mm) at different temperatures: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vs/ft/f5/vsftf5bvqr3hbn5-svjy9rvz2zm.png"><br><br>  The cost of designing, manufacturing and launching the missions of the Chang'e-4 mission was severely limited.  And the ability to even slightly exceed the costs - not something that was not, but on the contrary, the engineers were motivated to minimize parts and elements of the project, refine and expand their functionality in order to reduce the total cost of production and reduce costs. <br><br>  Therefore, the satellite repeater was originally designed with a relatively small weight (425 kg), so that the cost of its production and launch were minimal. <br><br>  Have backup satellites been made?  This is an interesting question - as an option, several prototypes were made, but only one was launched, the most proven one. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What happens if in space the satellite repeater fails? Of course, in its composition there are several backup elements that are most critical for the project - part of the on-board computer, the power supply system and the radio repeater. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the satellite reaches its working orbit beyond the Moon, then its efficiency will be maximum here and the service life may be up to 10 years. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The biggest problem that can occur with a satellite repeater is the fatal damage to the antenna, so it was made in the form of a giant umbrella with a mesh inner coating that micrometeorites can damage without disrupting the functional part. And the chance that a large meteorite will collide with a very little satellite transponder.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, if this happens, then within 30 days it will be possible to restore the communication channel ‚ÄúEarth the Other Side of the Moon‚Äù by launching a new repeater satellite and bringing it to a working orbit beyond the Moon. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The engineers of the Chinese Academy of Space Technology had the following new tasks after the creation of the repeater satellite:</font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> prepare a satellite repeater for launch on a launch vehicle and accompany the launch; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> track its trajectory and send a satellite

style="vertical-align: inherit;">The satellite relay can remain in its orbit for a long time due to the relatively low fuel consumption, since the gravity of the Earth and the Moon balances its
