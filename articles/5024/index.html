  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yahoo Branded Universe: everything you wanted to know about ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In October, when millions of game console fans from the legendary Nintendo were already beginning to eagerly twitch in anticipation of the brand new Wii, Yahoo Media Group (YMG) first decided to try out their latest concept of content organization on the Web.  Branded Universes is a phrase that is difficult to translate briefly into Russian, but the essence of the idea hiding under this beautiful name is easy to understand, and then it is even easier to start admiring it. <br><br>  Numerous Yahoo services contain a lot of interesting things.  But if you want to find out everything that is possible about a particular subject, it becomes difficult to put together pieces of scattered information. <br><br>  In order to maximally facilitate this process, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmini-sites was invented, each of which will be aimed solely at covering one single thing.  More specifically, one single brand, because Yahoo is a commercial organization and wants to make money.  Thus, each <b>Branded Universe is an information resource with specialized vertical content.</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Theoretically, this project has all the chances of success: users get a hodgepodge from all sources that Yahoo can give (from search to Answers), and the company is just an ideal advertising platform where exactly those commercial offers can show the target audience they are looking for themselves with interest. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe do not connect points for users on Yahoo.  So, the Branded Universe was created to solve this problem, ‚Äùsaid Vince Broady, head of Games, Entertainment and Youth (one out of 10) at Yahoo.  Its direction was chosen to test the effectiveness of a promising model. <br><br>  The first experiment, the <a href="http://wii.yahoo.com/">Nintendo Wii Universe</a> , proved to be uniquely successful.  The page with the most complete information about the console, which readers could initially get only through the Yahoo Games website, collected 1.2 million unique views in a month without promotion. <br><br>  On Wednesday, a new phase of the program was <a href="http://clickz.com/showPage.html%3Fpage%3D3624815">announced</a> .  At this time we will see already 6 sites that will be devoted to the TV series "Lost" and "Office", the films "Harry Potter" and "Transformers", as well as the games "Halo" and "Sims".  YMG has no plans to advertise in new Branded Universe projects and, interestingly, in the future also allows the creation of non-commercial mini-sites.  Now we are talking about a hundred of such resources. <br><br>  Even more interesting is that the company is so confident in the popularity of its creation among potential advertisers that it is going to select brands to work with them.  At the same time, as they say in YMG, there can be no talk of license deductions to trademark holders, because they are going to use only information that is already lying on the Web.  But if they reject Yahoo‚Äôs offer, they won't create Universe for them. <br><br>  I think time will show that this idea is worthy and this time Yahoo was ahead of all its competitors.  It will be more interesting to see their answer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5024/</a></p>
