Part 1: Introduction</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to you, dear users of the resource Habrahabr.  Starting today, I will start writing a story about a young man who is fond of computers and trying to change his life for the better and the attempts, prerequisites and tasks that he sets for himself.  Each part will be short, so that there is no tension and fatigue from reading, and the text is written simply, without frills and complex phrases.  More precisely, I will try to stick to the spoken language.  Further, if you like it, I will try to make the story better and better.  I am pleased to hear your comments and suggestions. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Legend:</b> <br>  <i>- Phrase third-party hero</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* Phrase protagonist</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* No sign * - thoughts of the main character</i>

      <b>Chapter 1. Part 1: Introduction</b> <br><br>  - Kohl, get up, Kohl! <br>  * Yes, yes, well, mom!  I get up now! <br>  Oh dear ... eye, one more eye, eh!  Close!  Light ... oh my goodness ... open your eyes!  What time is it?  7?  Damn, I slept for 3 hours!  My head hurts‚Ä¶ <br>  - Get up already come, and then you will be late for study! <br>  * Already getting up! <br>  Damn, how much a headache, I do not understand.  My head is empty.  Again I spent half a night at the computer.  It's time to finish with this.  Before the good will not bring. <br>  - I cooked you a porridge, eat it.  That's all, I'm going out! <br>  * Good luck today, mom. <br>  - Thank. <br>  So, fine, I was able to get out of bed, now ... yes, damn it, I again first turned on the computer.  It is already on the machine.  I do not even understand how to do it, but I understand what I did.  Well, before the release of another hour, I will have time to put myself in order, to eat, and I can even sit on the Internet for a while.  And, here, the computer was loaded.  What we have here ... so, the mail: ‚ÄúYou have become the winner of the lottery lohotronus2000!  In order to receive your prize in the form of a million dollars, you need to send $ 200 to our account for paperwork and delivery of your cargo ... ".  Yeah, you found the fool ... you don't even know my address, and I have won this lottery for six months in a row.  Millionaire fucking ... more ... spam ... spam ... spam ... so, a letter with a reminder of the birthday of a friend ... yes, it is convenient, otherwise it would have forgotten inadvertently.  Anyway, the friend is "best."  If you can call the person you see every six months.  Damn you computer, my "best friend version 2". <br>  Heh, and already the hands themselves are gaining the address of this site, this black hole of time called "vdire.rus".  Everything is there, even if I really wanted to communicate with people live, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to pull out into the street because of him.  Oh, yes, of course, you can always see new photos, videos or listen to pirated music, which is issued as a trial, ugh, idiocy ... and you see, everything is like a drug. <br>  So, who is in our network ... Vasya, Dima, Masha, Rita ... news ... oh, Masha began to meet Vasya ... damn it, lucky him.  But I like her.  No, who needs someone like me, a man obsessed with a computer.  I will never have a girlfriend.  Or maybe the devil knows, but probably this is really cool.  I would spend more time on the street ... or rather I hope that I would spend it at least a little ... my walk is usually the way from home to school and from home.  Something I began to think about something else, Dima has new photos.  Yes, rest, barbecues, nature, friends ... and my friends communicate with me only if I write the first one and all communication is online, online.  Again, you need to change something in life.  Although how many times have I told myself that?  But it always turns out the same: history repeats itself anew, you act as you are used to doing and only think about what needs to be done. <br>  And the time we have is 7:36.  Great!  I again do not have time to eat!  And it seems to wash!  Damn, turn off the computer.  Every time when I sit down for him in the morning all the plans fall apart, I don‚Äôt have time for anything!  Heck!  Heck!  Heck! <br>  Teeth, spit, chewing gum will save!  We must throw something in an empty stomach.  The kitchen should be cooked porridge mom.  Yes, there really is, but ... already cold.  Damn her, eat it. <br>  To get dressed ... I wanted to get dressed normally today and again I don‚Äôt have time to do anything!  Yeah, take this, this and this.  Spit that crumpled, stretch!  Everything, the computer is turned off, the teeth are not cleaned, the stomach is full of cold porridge, wrinkled and old clothes are worn, the standard day begins! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86796/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86796/</a></p>
