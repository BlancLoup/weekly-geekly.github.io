  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sale of the Sex.com domain for $ 13 million confirmed</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a4bce43f/7fe6a45d/c1868a33/338405ca.jpg"><br><br>  An online auction of domain names Sedo confirmed the sale of the domain name Sex.com for $ 13 million.  This is the most expensive domain name in the entire history of the Network, given that only the domain is sold, and not the assets of the company that was the former owner of the domain.  It should be noted that the Caribbean company Clover Holdings, registered in the offshore zone in the state of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, acted as a buyer.  This is the second largest sale in 2010, the second place by cost is the domain slots.com, sold for 5.5 million dollars.  The price of the last domain is determined by its gambling affiliation. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The domain domain Sex.com transaction was conducted by Sedo's domain broker Jeffrey Gabriel, who conducted a search for a potential buyer for three months on behalf of Escom, the former domain owner.  The latter sold the domain due to its own bankruptcy, confirmed by a California court.

      ‚ÄúWe are pleased that our domain, although it was sold due to the bankruptcy of our company, was sold for a record price.  It rarely happens that domains in a similar situation are really sold at real value, and we are glad that in this case everything went smoothly.  We are also grateful to the Sedo online auction, ‚Äùcommented on the sale of the domain Del Anthony, Escom executive director. <br><br>  It is worth noting that Escom bought the Sex.com domain in 2006 for $ 11.5 million.  It was a record price for a domain, and this record was broken only this year, after re-selling the specified domain.  This whole situation is a reflection of the actual needs of customers in premium domains, this is the opinion of experts. <br><br>  Unfortunately, Escom could not return the money spent on the domain purchase.  The company's management could not make this domain as profitable as planned, and the company declared itself bankrupt. <br><br>  Due to the fact that the domain for several years has risen in price by only 1.5 million dollars, experts raise a number of issues related to this transaction: <br><br>  - was the price for this domain overpriced in 2006? <br>  - perhaps domain prices in the .com zone are stable? <br>  - perhaps now the domain had to be sold at a lower price due to the fact that Escom simply did not have a choice? <br><br>  In any case, the situation with the sale of the domain is really interesting.  Over the past few years, only 2-3 deals with a similar price level have been made.  In 2008, the fund.com domain was sold for US $ 9999950, and in 2007, the porn.com domain was sold for 9.5 million dollars. <br><br>  Of course, there were more significant sales, but then it was about selling the domain and assets of the company to which this domain previously belonged.  This was the case with the domain insurance.com, sold for 35.6 million dollars. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.domainnews.com/en/sex.com-%2413m-sale-confirmed.html">domainnews</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108399/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108399/</a></p>
