  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problem with QIWI</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last night there was a need to replenish the purse on Webmoney.  Nearby was the QIWI terminal.  I decided to replenish through it. <br><br>  At first I was surprised that in order to replenish Webmoney you need to register in their Personal Account (LK).  Then it smiled that the system writes the amount on the account, but when you pay, you indicate the amount you need to put.  It does not spell how much will be written with%.  Later, a message is displayed that there are not enough funds.  As a result, in the operations log on the terminal I saw that the operation was not performed. <br><br>  I go home, I go to the site QIWI.  In the reports I see the error "Number does not exist."  I think, you never made a mistake, copying the number directly from Webmoney, I repeat - the same mistake.

      I call the caliper (at 20:00 Moscow time).  I wait for a long time (min. 10-12), then the girl picks up the phone, asks a lot of stupid questions and connects with those.  by service.  The call does not reach them, the girl says that try the operation again and call back in an hour, because  Specialists can not answer. <br><br>  An hour later, everything is repeated 1 to 1. Okay.  I think that specialists have long been eating buckwheat porridge at home. <br><br>  I call today in the morning at 9:30 Moscow time.  Again a bunch of stupid questions.  In the end, they say that we need to call back in an hour and ask specialists, because  they (!!!) work from 9 to 17. I say that already 9: 30 ... Pause.  Answer: "They have not come yet."  Ok, I think I'll call from work. <br><br>  It's 11:05.  I call.  New girl, even more questions.  I'm telling everything again.  Then I explain what I was told in the morning to call those back.  to specialists.  She connects.  Answer: ‚Äúthey cannot answer.  Call within an hour. ‚Äù <br><br>  The finish. <br><br>  Money in QIWI account.  I need to make a prompt payment today.  You can probably withdraw money through Contact, but the loss is 4% (min. 72 rubles).  Then again, you need to give% for entry.  By the way, the OSMP terminal (blue background, orange buttons) used to pay into its wallet, there were never any problems.  Enrollment took place in a couple of minutes. <br><br>  PS: 12:30 I got through to one more girl.  Redirected to webmoney.  I call there <br><br>  PS2: 12:45 Spoke with Webmoney support.  So that all so it worked!  All on business, politely and patiently.  It seems like something with a client.  They said where to look.  I will come home - I will be picked.  And QIWI would do well to post a schedule for their ‚Äútech.  specialists, ‚Äùand not to say that in an hour they will be. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53710/</a></p>
