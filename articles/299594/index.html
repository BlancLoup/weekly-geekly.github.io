      I cannot say what exactly is wrong, and here are a few examples - the head of Sberbank of Russia publicly criticizes his own automation projects and wants to buy only the technology of tomorrow.  Another example is that you can easily sell the SaaS service, to the marketing department of a large holding company and the head of the department will pay out of pocket.  Cloud technologies - infrastructure, PaaS and SaaS have become so accessible that a startup of 4 people can pay for all this.  The client is not the same - the client is changing. <br><br>  In my opinion, all today's changes are in the matrix "People in the organization or Employees - Consultants - The very structure of the organization - Technology."  Each component has an impact on the other components, and together they change the company, making it better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3aa/72f/680/3aa72f680c08400180e1dab72802feda.png"><br><br>  Today I will focus on the changes of the company under the influence of employees and technology.  Changes in people are habits and behavioral patterns that directly affect their performance of functional duties or the characteristics of generations.  By habits, I mean preferences for the better.  An illustration of such changes - if at home an employee uses all the latest innovations in the world of gadgets and software, then why in the office should he work on a desktop computer?  About the features of generations, I generally keep silent - 30-year-old "all the stars", and 20-year-old unmanaged, in principle. <br><br>  In my opinion, the impact of technology on changing a company is not as great as that of employees, and this is why - even when changing IT paradigms, for example, the emergence of cloud technologies, business objectives do not change.  At the same time, the proposal of new technologies implies a change in the consumption model of business automation services or IT infrastructure, and this is already changing the company - the tasks and structure of IT departments, for example. <br><br>  The tangle of change is only confusing. <br><br>  <b>Chicken or egg</b> <br><br>  While it is not quite clear to me how and to what extent the components of the ‚ÄúMatrix of Changes‚Äù influence the changes in the company, but it is obvious that they are closely connected with each other and equally affect the change in the company.  For example, a startup, as a temporary structure according to S. Blank, implies the maximum use of technology in the work due to a banal shortage of people. <br>  The paradox of my hypothesis about changes is that the company may not be aware that changes are taking place, because  everyone is used to operating the concept of external and internal factors affecting the company.  Why this can happen - for example, in a mature company all processes are built, KPIs are performed, training is adjusted and everything seems to be working, but the IT strategy has not changed for a long time and there are mobile workplaces in it, although the majority of employees come to work with tablets.  People have changed and come to work with their well-established habits, and perhaps the introduction of mobile jobs will increase the performance of the company at times? <br><br>  <b>7 reasons to change with employees - Citrix research</b> <br><br>  In 2015, Citrix <a href="http://www.globalcio.ru/experts/1215/%3Fsetstat%3D1%26from_digest%3D173%26item_id%3D173">conducted several studies</a> on the development of mobile technologies in companies and the attitude of employees towards remote work.  Excerpts from the research will help see the influence of employees and technology on changes in the company. <br><br>  <u>How will the workspace change? - WorkAnywhere</u> <br><br>  In 2016, more and more workspace designers will abandon the traditional office organization model based on open space divided by partitions.  The choice will be made in favor of the working environment created on the principle of universities - with places for interaction of user groups in common areas (hubs), common places (laboratories) and separate zones (libraries). <br><br>  Follow-me technologies have reached a level of development to ensure a high degree of user satisfaction at low cost for widespread use. <br><br>  <u>Results of work in new conditions</u> <br><br>  In the course of the research, 43% of employees indicated an increase in productivity, and 91% of users noted a significant increase in morale during the transition to the Remote. <br><br>  <u>Consumption model moves to mobile</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/321/3a0/567/3213a0567ead4bf69ca9514e051b3a9d.png"><br><br>  <u>Mobile users - all employees are divided into groups</u> <br><br>  The first group is the top steering.  The second group is traditional employees working outside the office.  They are almost all the time working in the mobile mode, so they also need access to data.  The third group of employees: traditional office staff, who only occasionally work remotely, but who still need an increasing number of services, including applications for exchanging short messages and files. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e4/0b6/14e/6e40b614e8164723ace3439b3a772d1f.png"><br><br>  <u>Trends in the development of IT departments</u> <br><br>  The ‚Äúbehind-me-follow-up ...‚Äù template, data, applications, telephony and printing services, with the mandatory provision of corporate security in 2016, will be decisive.  Primary in the approach of people who have already changed or are changing. <br><br>  <u>Security does not fade into the background</u> <br><br>  The security policy scenarios that companies choose for the listed major user groups, <br><br><ul><li>  28% of respondents plan to define special user roles and corresponding access / privileges. </li><li>  27% plan to implement security monitoring tools on a contextual basis. </li></ul><br>  This applies to companies that are already working in the direction of mobile security of employees, and 1/5 of respondents plan to begin such work in 2016. <br><br>  <u>Mobile Security Management Tools</u> <br><br><ul><li>  Mobile Device Management (58%). </li><li>  Corporate mobility management (37%). </li><li>  Using VPNs (35%). </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Personal experience</b> <br><br>  According to Microsoft research, people ‚Äústopped‚Äù working during office hours in the office, and began to work at home during off-hours.  This does not mean that people do nothing at all during office hours in the office, but rather that employees are ‚Äúdistracted‚Äù, ‚Äúnot in a mood‚Äù or at some other time during working hours.  This is a paradox, but it exists and the only way out in the company is to give an opportunity to work in a combined office-home format. <br><br>  An example from my practice - I work on all types of devices - a desktop PC, tablet, smartphone, and in each I focused on a signature that informs the recipient that I send mail from a smartphone and the answer may not be completely complete or superficial .  After a while, I removed these accents, since the answers did not differ in their completeness from different devices. <br>  The second example.  One time I went to the office from the far suburbs.  The road took a lot of time.  Every day I came to the office with completed tasks of the day and all the working time was resting from work (may the employer forgive me).  Case confirms the fact that if a person wants to work and is properly motivated, then the place and presence in the office is not so important for him. <br><br>  <b>How to sell cloud solutions to changing companies</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Understand the changes and not only technological and talk about them to potential customers. </li><li>  Research can be an excellent argument in working with potential customers towards the choice of cloud, SaaS or mobile solutions. </li><li>  Changes in a company (to make a company mobile, for example) requires project work, at least in the direction of managing mobile devices, infrastructure and security, i.e.  sales are project in nature. </li><li>  Medium and large business does not change the rhinestone - IT will always crush IT and optimally start selling the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãchange for each component of the ‚ÄúMatrix of Changes‚Äù. </li><li>  Select complete solution providers that close all changes.  My personal preferences are <a href="https://www.citrix.ru/">Citrix</a> solutions covering all planes ‚Äî access, storage and data management and mobile work. </li></ul><br>  All my recommendations are confirmed by sales of <a href="https://dentalcloud.pro/">Dental Cloud</a> in a very conservative segment of the automation of dentistry, as well as projects to create private clouds in clinics, which I will discuss in the following posts.  Today I looked at the changes of the company through the prism of Employees and Technologies.  In the next post I will try to show several case studies through the Structure and Consultants.  <a href="http://knopka.com/">I</a> will call the <a href="http://knopka.com/">button</a> ! <br><br>  Previous materials of the author. <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Megamind</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Habrahabr</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299594/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299594/</a></p>
