But lately, the growth rate of computing power and the introduction of new features have slowed down a lot.  Probably, the thing is that the vast majority of gamers are quite satisfied with the current quality and realistic game graphics.  Let's see this Friday how the graphics have changed in games for 45 years.  Attention!  The amount of video and nostalgia inside is rolls over. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3 id="spacewar-1962">  Spacewar!  (1962) </h3><br><p>  One of the first computer graphics games in history.  It was written for PDP-1 computers.  The gameplay was simple: two players controlled spacecraft, and tried to hit each other with rockets.  In addition, it was necessary to avoid a collision with a star that attracted players' ships to itself.  Ammunition and fuel for maneuvering were limited.  The game was very popular in the 1960s, and was ported to various platforms. </p><br><p>  So Spacewar!  looked at the present PDP-1 (yes, the monitors were still those): </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eePWlLKm_Bg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  But if we discard the imperfection of the display, the game looked like this: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FtW_QmzOjqc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  By the way, the starry sky was not generated from the baldies, but was a scheme of the real starry sky, which included stars up to the fifth magnitude. </p><br><h2 id="era-arkad">  Era of arcades </h2><br><h3 id="pong-1972">  Pong (1972) </h3><br><p>  Primitive arcade table tennis simulator.  The first game created by Atari, and in combination one of the most popular video games of that time.  Here, two players controlled the "rackets" by turning the knobs, trying not to miss the ball.  There was a single player mode.  There were versions of the game for the <a href="">set-top box</a> and in the form of a <a href="">gaming machine</a> . </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fiShX2pTz9A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="space-race-1973">  Space Race (1973) </h3><br><p>  This is the second after Pong game developed by Atari.  For two or one player.  It was necessary to fly on rockets, dodging obstacles.  Who did not have time to evade - lost.  Produced in the form of set-top box and gaming machine. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDtdKxZ9vWk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="tv-basketball-1974">  TV Basketball (1974) </h3><br><p>  This game was the first in three "nominations": </p><br><ul><li>  the first ever basketball game; </li><li>  the first game in which sprites are used; </li><li>  The first game in which the image of people appeared. </li></ul><br><p>  Purpose of the game: moving the "basketball players" to beat the ball so that it falls into the basket. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BMV_meVa7m8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="gun-fight-1975">  Gun Fight (1975) </h3><br><p>  Game-Western, in which it was necessary to defeat the enemy in a duel with pistols.  The first game, which depicts the battle of man with man.  Each player had two joysticks: one was controlled by a character, and the second was a pistol.  The number of rounds was limited - 6 per drum. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7A5DR5NOE0Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="death-race-1976">  Death Race (1976) </h3><br><p>  In the 1970s, people were not so spoiled yet, so after their release the game was widely criticized for promoting violence.  One or two players drove cars with steering wheels and pedals, and crushed the so-called ‚Äúgremlins‚Äù.  The more you crush, the more points you earn.  In place of the innocently killed, a cross appeared, and soon the screen turned into a graveyard.  It was necessary to avoid raids on graves.  After 20 years, the game idea will form the basis of the epochal Carmageddon. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aBBtt72aJLA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="canyon-bomber-1977">  Canyon Bomber (1977) </h3><br><p>  One or two players enthusiastically flew over a canyon filled with spherical stones.  They had to be bombed, and the more accurate the hit was, the more points you earned. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4b48yoIRkg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="space-invaders-1978">  Space Invaders (1978) </h3><br><p>  The era of the game, has gained immense popularity and ported to many platforms.  When these gaming machines appeared in Japan, there was even a shortage of coins of suitable denomination, there were so many people who wanted to play Space Invaders.  The goal was simple: it was necessary to shoot hordes of invading aliens, gradually descending to the ground and also shooting at you.  At the same time, the player‚Äôs gun was moving behind a row of four protective covers that were gradually destroyed by aliens.  As you progress through the levels, the enemies maneuvered and went down faster and faster. </p><br><p>  Despite the primitiveness of the graphics, the developer Tomohiro Nisikado had to create his own hardware platform based on the Intel 8080 processor. But he still didn‚Äôt cope well, and the rendering speed of the sprites slowed down significantly when there were many more aliens on the screen.  The author turned this flaw into a feature - the less enemies remained on the screen, the quicker they became and the more difficult it was to get into them. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/axlx3o0codc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2 id="stanovlenie-gonochnyh-simulyatorov">  The formation of racing simulators </h2><br><h3 id="speed-freak-1979">  Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãFreak (1979) </h3><br><p>  One of the first racing games in the first person, and the first world vector race.  The goal is to reach the finish line without crashing into obstacles and oncoming traffic, without departing from the road. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/syDQ1GEM-s8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="pac-man-1980">  Pac-Man (1980) </h3><br><p>  In terms of the degree and duration of influence on popular culture, this game can be compared with a megaton explosion in the middle of a megacity.  The player had to manage the ever-hungry Kolobok, crawled into the dungeon, teeming with unfriendly fauna.  In total, the game has 255 levels, and the kolobok is sometimes thrown up with useful nishtyaki, increasing speed and even making it temporarily invulnerable to ghosts. </p><br><p>  Pac-Man became the founder of a new genre - "chase in the maze."  As Toru Ivatani, one of the game designers, later admitted, they wanted to make a humorous game without any violence, so that it would be comfortable for the widest possible audience to play.  Although Pac-man was originally in his native Japan - then he was called PUCK MAN - he was met with absolutely indifference.  But in the US, the game broke all the patterns, charts and sales records.  As a result, Pac-Man began its triumphant march around the world. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uswzriFIf_k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2 id="nachinaetsya-era-platformerov">  The era of platformers begins </h2><br><h3 id="donkey-kong-1981">  Donkey Kong (1981) </h3><br><p>  One of the early representatives of the genre of platformer.  A character in a cap named Mario was supposed to save a certain mamzel named Pauline from the aggressive gorilla Donka Kong.  Later, Mario will be one of the most popular characters in video games, if not the most popular.  And he began as a fighter with monkeys. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pp2aMs38ERY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="pole-position-1982">  Pole Position (1982) </h3><br><p>  Racing "Formula 1": it was necessary to first pass the qualifying race, and then participate in competitions.  The configuration of the racing tracks repeated the real tracks.  This game set the standard for displaying racing games for many years to come: sprite graphics, a third-person view. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_xN8BaqbAd0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="tapper-1983">  Tapper (1983) </h3><br><p>  Bartender simulator: you need to throw full circles in time to hungry visitors, and grab the empty ones.  If one of the unfinished clients reached the end of the bar, the bartender was thrown out the window.  By the way, appreciate the inscription on the <a href="">cover</a> : "The most innovative game for slot machines 1984". </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q47Zz0AMgVE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="duck-hunt-1984">  Duck Hunt (1984) </h3><br><p>  Another icon game.  The Duck Hunt slot machines and Nintendo Entertainment System consoles (made before 1995) were equipped with pistols that operated according to the ‚Äúlight pen‚Äù principle.  On the screen, ducks flew out of the undergrowth, which had to be shot with a minimum of misses.  And the dog happily snapped the prey.  If desired, it was possible to switch to the plate shooting mode.  In terms of sales, the game ranks second on the NES platform - 28 million copies. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x-daxzVxrQI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="super-mario-bros-1985">  Super Mario Bros.  (1985) </h3><br><p>  Four years after the release, Donkey Kong, an Italian plumber who is not afraid of vicious primates, began to conquer the world.  In this arcade, it was necessary to manage a mustached peasant plumber Mario in a jumpsuit and a cap and his brother Luji.  When traveling around the world, you had to dodge enemies or defeat them, jumping on their heads, as well as collecting hidden coins along the way.  The goal - to reach the end and save the princess. </p><br><p>  This game is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the best-selling in history - 40 million copies.  Actually, not a few other game characters can compete with Mario in recognition.  Echo <del>  of war </del>  The popularity of Mario still hovers in popular culture. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aw4JccvxU-s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="the-legend-of-zelda-1986">  The Legend of Zelda (1986) </h3><br><p>  This game marked the beginning of the eponymous, very popular series of games produced for many years.  The main character - someone Link - must save the kingdom from the invading army of the Prince of Darkness.  He travels the world in search of a magical Artifact, fights enemies, pumps features and uses inventory: hello, RPG! </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Fp0OsEv20c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2 id="rascvet-faytingov">  The flowering of fighting games </h2><br><h3 id="street-fighter-1987">  Street Fighter (1987) </h3><br><p> And this game gave rise to a whole era of fighting games - games in which you had to fight hand to hand with each other or with enemies.  Here there were combo attacks and six-button control of the character.  In Street Fighter, it was necessary to win in fights, each round lasted for 30 seconds (if none of the fighters had time to knock out, the one who had more health left behind won). </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTngm3O3CDo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="galaxy-force-1988">  Galaxy Force (1988) </h3><br><p>  Third-person shooter in which you had to manage a futuristic space fighter, fighting with the troops of the evil Fourth Empire.  Fights were fought both in space and on six planets. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hYSzt0MKdZg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="prince-of-persia-1989">  Prince of Persia (1989) </h3><br><p>  Another legend of the world of games.  Making your way through the labyrinth of dungeons, you were to save the princess with the help of the Persian blond prince.  You had only one hour to do this.  On the way lurked traps, puzzles and enemies.  The game was incredibly popular and ported to many platforms.  For technologies of that time, the character had surprisingly realistic movements, and the game itself was very atmospheric.  The MS-DOS version soon hit the USSR and quickly spread across institutes and factories, often paralyzing the work of entire departments.  I met this game in 1993, and it made an indelible impression on me.  I still remember that Shift was responsible for the sword strike. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bOC193hQs2I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="castle-of-illusion-1990">  Castle of Illusion (1990) </h3><br><p>  Platform for consoles company SEGA, in which Mickey Mouse saved his mouse passion Minnie Mouse, which the evil witch kidnapped and imprisoned in the castle.  The game was distinguished by a variety of opponents, each type of which needed to find its own approach in terms of destruction, although in general the gameplay was similar to the games about Mario. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s33_kMCGa2Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="sonic-the-hedgehog-1991">  Sonic The Hedgehog (1991) </h3><br><p>  In the early 1990s, this game was the face and icon of the Sega consoles in post-Soviet Russia.  A piece of the gameplay was shown in television advertising, and it was very cool and colorful, where there are Chinese clones of Dendy.  Still: 16-bit Sega was a bit higher in quality graphics and special effects than 8-bit Dendy.  The protagonist of the game - charged with incredible adrenaline, jet hedgehog Sonic, who was driven by a thirst to find a villain named Dr.  Eggman, a scientist who sharpened animals inside robots and stole the magical Chaos Emeralds. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLhCGP0mLRs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="mortal-kombat-1992">  Mortal Kombat (1992) </h3><br><p>  This is one of the best in the history of fighting games, which actually set a new bar for the quality of animation, the variety of combo attacks, and at the same time poured tons of blood on players.  Initially, the game was developed for slot machines, but was ported to set-top boxes and personal computers (the graphics were better there).  In Mortal Kombat there were a lot of game characters between which fights took place.  Each character had his own tricks, his own strengths and weaknesses.  The game was incredibly entertaining, playable and bloody.  We had so much adrenaline during the fights, as if we ourselves fought with each other in the ring.  Just an epic litter, you can not say otherwise.  An excellent means of relaxation after a hard day‚Äôs work, like all games of the Mortal Kombat series.  By the way, you will be surprised, but there is even a storyline in this fighting game. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ThRuSjkJIG0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2 id="pobednoe-shestvie-3d">  3D march </h2><br><h3 id="doom-1993">  Doom (1993) </h3><br><p>  Once there was no need to explain to anyone what a Doom is.  Everyone knew about this game.  In the course was even a meme "I will go on <strong>thinking</strong> ayu".  Doom has set the standard for first-person shooters for many years.  The plot is primitive, and the game itself is not disclosed.  In fact, you play as a special commando on Mars, who shoots with extreme cruelty hordes of monsters that came to the planet due to an unsuccessful teleportation experiment that opened a portal to hell. </p><br><p>  Compared to Wolfenstein 3D, released from the pen of the same id Software just a year earlier, Doom looked like an expensive foreign car next to a nondescript zhigulenok (although both of them seem like twenty years old): </p><br><p>  Wolfenstein 3D: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDCltwlG0t0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Doom: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jP2jI0BVG0w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="tekken-1994">  Tekken (1994) </h3><br><p>  A bright representative of Japanese fighting games, with a specific character design.  However, unlike other fighting games, in Tekken, players could control each arm and leg of a fighter separately.  Curiously, the game was originally created as an internal project of the Namco company, designed to test 3D-animation.  But in the end it turned into a full-fledged simulator of melee fights. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q1-f22hOzWQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="time-crisis-1995">  Time Crisis (1995) </h3><br><p>  First-person shooter in which you had to play with a pistol (which is a ‚Äúlight pen‚Äù).  The game itself controlled the movements of the camera, and the player needed to shoot all the opponents on the screen. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nTnjNL1c9c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="quake-1996">  Quake (1996) </h3><br><p>  Heir Doom, much surpassed his ancestor.  The first truly three-dimensional shooter in which you could approach the enemy's corpse and view it from different angles - in the same Doom it was just sprites that were displayed on the screen equally from any angle.  It was with the release of Quake that such a thing as e-sports emerged, because this game has reached a new level of realistic graphics and demands on the players' reaction.  In the people he was affectionately called "quake".  And there was a rocketjack in Quake!  This is when the player jumped up and fired from the rocket launcher while running, so that the explosion would raise him higher and throw him further, even at the cost of decreasing his health.  So it was possible to move much faster and jump on the heights inaccessible in the usual way. </p><br><p>  The plot is even more primitive than in Doom: you are some kind of abstract soldier, destroying the monsters that move on your military base.  But Quake was originally created based on the multiplayer mode.  True, at first only in local networks, because in those years the Internet was still a wonder, and modems and telephone lines did not provide the required level of delays. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHT2TgMX7Rg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="gran-turismo-1997">  Gran Turismo (1997) </h3><br><p>  This game marked the beginning of a whole series of racing games.  The real samples of cars were modeled here quite thoroughly for that time, the features of their behavior on the track were simulated.  An existing tuning system was implemented, which allowed the car to change its behavior by tuning / replacing various components. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X6DePq3nvSk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="final-fantasy-vii-1997">  Final Fantasy VII (1997) </h3><br><p>  Fantastic Japanese RPG, one of the many games of the very popular Final Fantasy series.

In the course of an unsuccessful scientific experiment in the top-secret Black Mesa research complex, aggressive aliens get into our world.  You - the scientist Gordon Freeman, an employee of the complex, begin to fight the creatures, in the hope of correcting the situation. </p><br><p>  The game was innovative from the point of view that the plot was told as the game progressed, in conversations between characters and other scripted scenes, and not through video inserts or text blocks.  Half Life has become one of the first games where the player has allied characters as they pass.  Moreover, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãmanaging them acted surprisingly sensibly, which was one of the breakthroughs in computer games.  The plot and its unusual presentation were so exciting that Half Life is considered by many to be one of the most exciting games in history.

Progress is not only impressive, it is like the evolution of life in miniature: from primitive graphic forms to the most complex models of the world with the highest level of graphic and physical simulations.  So much so that even processors and video cards no longer show the same performance growth rates.  Of course, partly because of the difficulties that engineers face, but in many respects due to the decline in demand from the gaming industry.  After all, far from all games use at least 90% of the capabilities of modern hardware. </p></div>
