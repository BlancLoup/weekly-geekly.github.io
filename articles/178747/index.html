      No, you say, it's not at all true, right?  Geeks help each other!  Well, um, maybe sometimes we help, but most of the time we are part of the most cruel, critical and indifferent community of all that I know.  How many sites in a day do we shit?  How many clients do we want to go to hell?  How much do we mock at the crooked photoshop? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The insane amount of posts per day is written about how everyone is doing everything around wrong!  Enough to use Comic Sans, damn you!  What are you, illiterate?  Grammar natsi have become implanted in our culture, and not to take into account what was written with a little ochepyatka ( <i>there was an interesting play on words, but to adequately translate it, unfortunately, it is not possible</i> - note lane.) deed <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúYou make up the tables?  Now what, the 90s in the yard?  Ha ha ha! ‚Äù </blockquote><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThis design looks like MySpace ate Friendster and spit it all out at Geocities!‚Äù </blockquote><blockquote>  ‚ÄúDo you use the standard MySQL hash algorithm instead of bcrypt?  I think you need to stop coding and check if workers are being hired at the nearest factory, because sir, it‚Äôs not only programmable that is contraindicated, but even just to touch the computer. ‚Äù </blockquote><blockquote>  ‚ÄúGod, how I hate the Arduino - this is not for labor developers!  To use this garbage is the same as going to the nearest radio shop ( <i>in the original - going down to Target; apparently, this is a network of department stores selling electronics and electronics, among others</i> ), and it‚Äôs stupid to buy what you going to build.  Arduino is made for idiots who don‚Äôt know how to program, because they‚Äôre too stupid to figure out how to plug an LPT cable into a breadboard.  Lord, today's children are just incredible IDIOTS. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  All of this is a slightly hyperbolic variation of these comments, which I actually saw. <br><br>  What the hell guys?  Why is this attitude so common?  And what's more, this all goes beyond the simple criticism of other designers, home-builders and developers.  Why does every wise guy I meet really hates hipsters?  Or the same "bratyun"? <br><br>  Are we all back to high school? <br><br>  I want to talk about how I communicated with people from other parties, especially with athletes.  I already talked about this, so if I repeat - forgive me.  When I was 16, I was a huge (literally, I was physically huge) zadrot.  I'm not sure, maybe it's because my school was very small, but somehow I managed to make friends with a pair of skateboarders.  After I went to the local skatepark with them several times and helped to shoot some promotional videos, I decided that I should learn to skate too - so I took and bought a skateboard. <br><br>  It must have looked ridiculous from the outside.  Thick Nerd, who obviously would be more comfortable messing around with the interpreter of Python than on a skate ramp, reels out around the parking lot meaninglessly. <br><br>  But nobody told me that I sucked, or that I was too fat to do this, or that I should give up all my attempts.  In fact, it was quite the opposite.  Once I was sitting in a skatepark, and just watched others ride, in my heart dreaming that I was not here.  One of my friends, Steve, approached me and asked what the hell I was doing. <br><br>  <i>- I suck ride.</i>  <i>Probably, I better train at home or something like that.</i>  <i>I do not want to be confused by anyone under my feet.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- What?</i>  <i>Dude, you look like a crank when you sit on a place like this and you don‚Äôt learn anything just by looking at the others.</i>  <i>If I see again that you are just sitting on the railing and doing nothing, then we will not call you again.</i> <br><br>  Of course, he said it a little more harshly than I recounted, but the main message was just that. <br><br>  I have never seen such an approach among geeks.  It always came down to ‚Äúyou do everything wrong, and you have to score for it, because you get suck‚Äù, or ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt use <b>$ new_crush_ language</b> , then you are a horse‚Äù. <br><br>  Why do you guys do that?  Most of us were zadroty in youth, and the attitude in the spirit of "you are not cool enough to be among <b>$ cool_designers</b> or in the circle of <b>$ cool_programmers</b> " - this is exactly what we had to fight.  It feels like we're all sitting in the school cafeteria again. <br><br>  I have a suggestion for you: in the next 30 days, try to be more like my friend Steve.  Instead of pushing in every possible way that your acquaintances are sloping coders, because they don't manage memory manually, or that your customers are illiterate idiots, and generally they dare to question your professionalism, try better to give people constructive criticism.  If their design is bad, tell them how to make it better.  If their code is bad, offer them a patch, and make it better.  If their pronunciation or grammar is wrong - just hammer on it. <br><br>  And please, tie this irrational hatred of hipsters.  Most of the hipsters I know are crazy about geek culture, and would be delighted if someone showed them a laser cutter. <br><br>  Yes, I understand that this post is also full of criticism.  How ironic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178747/</a></p>
