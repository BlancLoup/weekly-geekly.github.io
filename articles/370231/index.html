  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How it is done. Coworking</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How to organize a workplace?  Whether it is an office, coworking or a home office, many factors influence the formation of an ideal atmosphere for productive activity.  Here and maintaining order on the tables, and properly selected colors of the environment, and light and sound.  The correct working environment adjusts the mind to the desired rhythm, and you yourself can‚Äôt do it without knowing it more than you even expected. <br><br>  In the home office, only you are responsible for your comfort, your employer is in the office.  And in these two cases, sometimes it depends on you only the order on your desktop.  But in co-working, we are directly interested in your work being as productive as possible.  In this article we want to tell you what principles we were guided in when creating our Co-working <a href="https://coworking.ru/"><b>14</b></a> working space, and how this is all managed now. <br><br><h2>  Glass and light </h2><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/coworking14/blog/286534/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11d/8c3/b1c/11d8c3b1c8ab7efc8174b007aa577aee.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On 2000 square meters of our coworking, we have placed 240 work areas.  To delimit the space, ‚Äúisland zoning‚Äù was arranged using rounded podiums.  But in order to truly allocate jobs for teams, we seriously approached the problem of lighting.  We do not have an ordinary office, where cheap fluorescent lamps are often used.  Properly selected lighting allows us to positively influence the mood and health of our residents, increasing their concentration and productivity.  This is achieved on the basis of data on the biological characteristics and the emotional impact of light on humans.  For example, in work areas we use cold color, it increases concentration.  In recreation areas, warm light is used, it is ideal for relaxation.

      It is very important to choose the right light level.  300 lux is enough for general lighting, but lamps should be installed in the work areas, which will give at least 500 lux.  And it should be light not only from a ceiling lamp or a desk lamp.  Lighting should be combined.  We are also considering the possibility of adjusting the color temperature and light intensity for individual work areas. <br><br>  In addition to artificial light, one should not forget about the natural, which in itself has a beneficial effect on the human psyche.  Natural light stimulates the metabolism, blood circulation, respiration and activity of the central nervous system.  All this directly affects high performance.  Tables in many of the Coworking 14 work areas are located sideways to huge windows, which provides excellent natural light. <br><br><h2>  Temperature and humidity </h2><br>  You probably noticed that in the room where many people are sitting and all the windows are closed, most of the employees behave like sleepy flies.  Everything is simple - internal ventilation does not cope, oxygen in the air becomes less, and the temperature more and more.  In such conditions, the brain falls asleep.  The most comfortable temperature for productive work - 22 degrees Celsius.  It is also not worth doing colder, as it is important for many people to work in comfortable clothes, which most often does not imply some sweaters and warm socks. <br><br>  We at Coworking 14 carefully monitor the temperature and humidity in all rooms: from the common space to meeting rooms and conference rooms.  In addition to the good mood and spirit of the collaboration, our high-tech assistants take care of the state of the office atmosphere: <br><br><ul><li>  system of supply and exhaust ventilation Gea (Germany) with heating and air cooling <br></li><li>  central air conditioning system chiller-fancoil "Carrier" (USA) <br></li><li>  heating system with redundancy on the basis of convectors and radiators Kermi <br></li><li>  Johnson Controls dispatch and remote monitoring system. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d0/c2f/8a4/2d0c2f8a466b5bbf44ce907c1a830465.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Colour </h2><br>  Separately, I want to tell you about the choice of colors for our work areas.  Psychologists say that bright colors distract and overload the nervous system, and variegation can cause headaches and increase fatigue.  We tried to collect in the design of our co-working calm warm and cold colors.  This combination helps to achieve several goals at once: <br><br><ol><li>  Visually expand the space.  We have it and so is not small, but people like to feel the spaciousness. <br></li><li>  Achieve the ideal for the work of psychological background. <br></li></ol><br>  Of course, this does not mean that everything is done in the same blue-gray tones.  In the orange cabins you can arrange brainstorming, this color perfectly enhances the mood, self-esteem and team enthusiasm.  And if you are tired, then welcome to a small table by the window.  The walls there are made in light green tones, which has a positive effect on vision, and promotes concentration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/934/59a/906/93459a906564bfc4631f938532cd796c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Tables and chairs </h2><br>  How does everything start when you just come to work?  From the desktop.  There should always be order.  No climbing cable bundles, scattered piles of paper, stationery.  It would seem that these are all attributes of ordinary working activity, but in reality the disorder on the table greatly demoralizes.  You, of course, will not count, but your subconscious has already decided everything for you. <br><br>  Therefore, not only do we carefully monitor the order in our coworking, we also approached with great care the selection of tables, chairs and the organization of the working space around them.  First, the tables.  They are open at the bottom, it allows our guests to move freely, sitting behind them, without fear of hitting.  No extra shelves for keyboard or paper.  They always become just dust collectors and are practically not used for their intended purpose. <br><br>  Secondly, the chairs.  They are all soft, with a comfortable back and often with armrests.  We understand that our residents spend most of the work day in a sitting position, so that a properly selected chair will save you at least from back problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e7/3d5/0ab/0e73d50ab67d323120fb1da844db3074.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  21 century.  You can make the office very convenient and comfortable, but without full technical support it will be useless.  Many companies buy office equipment as needed, which often leads to downtime.  We immediately bought all possible equipment for Coworking 14 and its maintenance is a huge amount of work performed by our administrators and technical services.  For the workers (and not only) of the needs of the coworkers, we have: <br><br><ul><li>  printers, scanners, copiers <br></li><li>  projector and projection screen <br></li><li>  Smart TVs <br></li><li>  adjustable lighting <br></li><li>  access control and time tracking devices <br></li><li>  refrigerators, microwaves, dishwasher, etc. <br></li><li>  light and sound for mass events, photo and video shooting <br></li><li>  equipment for organizing online broadcasting, webinars <br></li><li>  even a soldering station, Orange Pi, Mediatek Development Board and more ... <br></li></ul><br>  Well, where to without the Internet.  Wi-Fi is available throughout the entire co-working, and a very serious technique is responsible for its availability on 27/7.  We use equipment from the company MikroTik - this allowed us to create a high-speed, seamless Wi-Fi coverage throughout covorking.  The cable from the Russian manufacturer of TPD Paritet from Podolsk helped us to connect the equipment with each other. <br><br>  And, of course, we must not forget about security.  Many of our residents conduct their business from our coworking, which means that no one and nothing should intercept traffic from our network.  Equipment from the company MikroTik allows you to solve the problems of protection of any level. <br><br><h2>  Administration </h2><br>  What do coworking administrators do?  This is a great service that works in many directions: from tracking the cleanliness and to never ending coffee to providing technical equipment and equipping work areas. <br><br>  The administrator of our coworking is not just an administrator, in the first place it is a friend of the resident who is able to help him in any aspects of work in coworking. <br>  The tasks of our administrators include not only monitoring cleanliness in common areas and monitoring the availability of water in the coolers.  His responsibilities also include the preparation of space for events: testing the operability of technology, the logistics of the organizers at the event, and so on.  Often, filming and control of this process are conducted in our coworking, often also lies with the co-working administrator. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370231/</a></p>
