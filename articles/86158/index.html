  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AKG K-518 - DJ or not DJ?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the life of everyone there came a time when it was time to choose new headphones.  My old men AKG K-55 began to pass slowly, so I went to the vast expanses of the Internet to find high-quality, inexpensive, comfortable headphones. <br>  Here is my choice. <br><br><img src="http://s19.radikal.ru/i192/1003/01/3553edc54ed5.jpg"><br><br>  And preludes and impressions inside. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, I have 3,000 rubles in my hands and I need to find headphones for the house.  That is, it should not be liners and plugs, and good closed "ears". <br>  Those that I had were classic monitor headphones AKG K-55, which at one time were very good, but now they just become obsolete.

I chose AKG.  First, I worked with them before (not only K-55), when I worked as a DJ, so it‚Äôs impossible to doubt their quality, in contrast to number 3, with the brand of which there were often problems in mini-jack. <br><br><img src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i201/1003/c2/b1c45f31c57d.jpg"><br><br>  According to the characteristics, in principle, all 3 are the same, but this is what attracted me to AKG, which distinguishes them from the remaining two: <br>  -Maximum sensitivity (115 dB vs. 104-106 dB) <br>  -Maximum power (2000 mW vs. 1500 mW) <br>  -Ease <br>  - Built-in bass level control <br>  - Folding design <br>  -Adapter on 6.3 included (sometimes needed) <br><br>  Of course, this is not the main and not very different options.  But together they influenced my choice.  Particularly pleased that they add up, because  This is very important in the conditions of my small apartment. <br><br>  And now, actually, the review itself <br><br><img src="http://s49.radikal.ru/i126/1003/b7/ffb3dd9ce345.jpg"><br><br>  The box I received did not contain anything special.  There were only headphones, adapter, case, warranty card and mini instruction. <br><br>  So, I immediately began to get acquainted with the headphones. <br><br>  By tradition - characteristics: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b9e/9b2/a7a/b9e9b2a7a22857c40224483ae64e866f.jpg"><br><br>  The most important thing that I liked about them was increased mechanical stability, since  In all previous headphones, either the attachments to the speakers were broken or the wires were frayed.  Probably, in a couple of years, I can tell you for sure if they have any opposition to such loads, but so far, the ‚Äúears‚Äù look very well-built, very pleasant to the touch. <br><br>  What else was pleasantly surprised is that they are really very light, which is why they are not strongly felt on the head, and this gives you additional comfort. <br><br><img src="http://s15.radikal.ru/i189/1003/6d/2a4a489627b4.jpg"><br><br>  They sit tightly and comfortably on the head, the only thing that upsets a little is that they do not completely cover the ears and, to be audible, they press a little, but this is only noticeable after a long, at least hourly continuous wear. <br><br>  It is strange that this is observed in headphones that are designed for DJ, which should not be discomfort.  However, I can say in their favor that when the music is turned on outside, the headphones isolate very well from noise, in fact, I heard only what was playing in my player, and not what was heard throughout my apartment from 5.1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a78/d04/e81/a78d04e81c84586794173a204ab84cc5.jpg"><br><br>  The wire is solid, black, pleasant to the hands, I hope, it will not break fast. <br>  Mini jack 3.5, standard, gold plated.  All right.  There is an adapter for 6.3 for DJ installations or old old players from the USSR. <br><br>  Separately, of course, I want to say about the sound, because for it, in fact, any headphones are bought.  Well, short, the sound is excellent, at 5+. <br>  And in detail it is difficult to choose epithets, but I will try.  The sound is heard with extreme clarity, all instruments are heard separately and they can be easily distinguished (and this is great!).  The sound is generally very powerful and lively.  I would say that high frequencies are floating a little, although the bass can be heard very loudly and clearly.  Acoustic guitar sounds great. <br>  Listened to loseless format.  It turned out that before that I was listening not to loseless.  In AKG, it really sounds great =) <br><br>  As a bonus, I want to say that the headphones are warm enough, so I recommend to those who walk in the winter without a hat and take care of their ears, just remember that they don‚Äôt close their ears and they are harmed.  Accordingly, in the summer they will be a little uncomfortable, because it will be stuffy.  For the summer, generally good gags.  So, sorry, distracted from the topic ... <br><br>  Headphones stacked up.  It is useful during transportation or storage.  Included in the kit is a fleece case into which they fit perfectly. <br><br><img src="http://s61.radikal.ru/i171/1003/76/6ecff1d0f312.jpg"><br><br>  The price of this item varies from 1980 rub.  up to 3490 rubles  I personally bought for 2690. <br><br><h3>  Summarize. </h3><br>  <strong>Pros:</strong> <br>  -Characteristics in comparison with other models <br>  -Quality, power and clarity of sound <br>  - Folding mechanism <br>  - Two-sided sound insulation <br>  - Reasonable price <br><br>  <strong>Minuses:</strong> <br>  - High Frequency Oiled <br>  -Davit with long wearing <br><br>  So, my subjective assessment of these headphones 5-.  These are good ‚Äúears‚Äù of the initial DJ level, which will suit everyone who wants to enjoy high-quality sound for an average standard price. <br><br>  Yes, after the purchase I was given to listen to Sennheiser HD 215. In general, you know, I absolutely did not regret.  The sound in them is much worse.  Yes, and you can not fold. <br><br>  Headphones tested on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/80920/">iPod Classic</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/82042/">Trascend 320</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86158/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86158/</a></p>
