  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Naumen became a partner of the conference PyCon Russia 2014</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the first working days of the summer, representatives of the IT community who are keen on developing in Python, met at the conference PyCon Russia 2014. Instead of a frosty Ural winter, this time an unpredictable Ural summer.  The event was held at the recreation center "Oriole" on June 2-3, near the city of Yekaterinburg. <br><br>  The conference was attended not only by our compatriots, but also by foreign guests.  The reports were in both Russian and English, workshops, round tables, and lightning talks, already loved by everyone at this conference, were also held. <br><br>  The program director of the conference was our colleague, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/apatrushev/">Anton Patrushev</a> : <br>  ‚ÄúI want to tell you a little about the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the conference PYCON.RU. <br>  When we started planning the Russian conference, I had already attended several Ukrainian conferences, where about 30% of the participants were from Russia.  In 2010-2011, in Kiev, on the afterparty, a long time ago they raised the issue with active participants of the Russian python community about creating a similar event in Russia.  In late 2011 and early 2012, IT people supported the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãholding this event.  We were inspired and conducted several local python events ( <a href="http://ekbpy.ru/">ekbpy.ru</a> ).  Then we realized that we were able to organize a large conference. <br>  This year we decided to change the season and hold a conference in the summer.  The same exit format for 2 days, as last time. <br>  In the program of this year I mainly dealt with speakers from Russia.  Our approach is not much different from other conferences.  We announce the set and at the same time invite all the well-known and cool speakers to speak at PYCON.RU  This year we managed to bring several Python Core Developer's at once.  I think that communication with them brought quite a lot of benefit to the participants of the conference. <br>  What can you say about the last Pycon?  We can say with confidence that everything turned out perfectly.  Although not without problems and difficult tasks.  This time we met with difficulties inviting foreign speakers, I think everyone knows the current political situation. <br>  In general, according to subjective feelings, the reports this year were at a high level.  The audience also showed considerable interest in master classes.  For those who were at the conference for the second time, it became a meeting place with already familiar people from different parts of our (and not only) country.  The success of the first conference can be considered an accident, the current one - a coincidence.  To turn this into a pattern, we must try.  Therefore, in preparing the next PYCON, we want to spend much more time preparing content.  This task needs to start doing now. "

      At Pycon, there is always a lot of entertainment and gifts from partners; everyone can find something to do on the evening of the first day.  Naumen traditionally partner with Pycon.  This time there were several PR-actions that took place during coffee breaks and afterparty.  Participants enjoyed refreshments from Naumen: juices, fruit drinks, cold coffee, had the opportunity to capture the bright moments with the help of photo booths.  And the strongest and most skillful in the evening was waiting for the ‚ÄúRope Course‚Äù, where everyone could briefly feel like a real rope tamer. <br><br>  Thank you all for the hot start of the summer, see you at the next Pycon.ru! <a name="habracut"></a></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/229485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/229485/</a></p>
