      In 1884, the Harvard philosopher, William James, said: "If you want to have some character trait, act as if you already have it." <br><br>  And scientific studies increasingly confirm this. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">The science of living, "as if ..."</font> </h2><br>  In his new book, ‚ÄúAs if Principle: A Radically New Approach to Changing Your Life‚Äù (Richard Wiseman) summarizes his research and explains how actions can determine feelings. . <br><br>  Researchers recommended that people smile.  What is the result?  Those felt happier. <br>  From the book "The Principle of" as if ": a radically new approach to changing your life": <br><blockquote>  More than 26,000 people were interviewed.  All participants were randomly divided into several groups and asked to perform various exercises designed to make them happier.  When it came to raising the level of happiness, those who resorted to changing facial expressions were in the forefront.  This is powerful evidence that the ‚ÄúAs if‚Äù principle is capable of evoking emotions outside the laboratory, and that these feelings are strong and last for a long time. </blockquote><br>  Why are photographs better when people are asked to say cheese?  The sound "s" makes your lips blur in a smile. <br>  From the book "The Principle of" as if ": a radically new approach to changing your life": <br><blockquote>  Researchers at the University of Michigan were inspired by photographers where people smile after asking to say ‚Äúcheese.‚Äù  They asked the participants to repeatedly pronounce the sound "s" in such a way that a smile appeared on their face, or so that the face expressed disgust. </blockquote><br>  What happens if people are injected with Botox, which provides a happier facial expression?  It relieves depression. <br>  What happens if, according to the Hollywood traditions, people inject so much Botox that they can hardly move the muscles of the face?  They lose the ability to experience a fullness of emotions. <br><br>  From the book "The Principle of" as if ": a radically new approach to changing your life": <br><blockquote>  The results of studies of patients with spinal injuries and women with Botox injections are unambiguous: the suppression of human behavior and facial expressions prevent people from experiencing certain emotions.  Among the disadvantages of this impact is that people are less likely to experience positive emotions such as happiness and joy.  However, the plus is that they are also less likely to experience negative emotions, such as anger and anxiety. </blockquote><br>  Fun fact - the brain is programmed to interpret what the body is experiencing, and it does not always cope well with it. <br>  This is called ‚Äúwrong attribution of emotions‚Äù and can serve as an explanation of the ‚Äúeffect of cancellation‚Äù after a break up. <br><br>  From the book "The Principle of" as if ": a radically new approach to changing your life": <br><blockquote>  When relationships end, people often feel particularly uneasy.  If they meet a new potential partner soon after parting with the previous one, they may misinterpret their anxiety as a sign of passion.  This is proved by the results of studies where a group of men were asked to undergo a personal test, after which they received positive (so that they feel good) or negative feedback (so that they <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/7-neozhidannykh-veshchey-kotorye-mogut-pomoch-vam-uspokoitsya/">feel anxious</a> ).  Then the men were asked to wait in the cafeteria;  while they waited, an attractive woman approached them.  Men who had just received negative feedback found the woman especially attractive, as Schechter had predicted. </blockquote><br>  This can also explain the Stockholm syndrome in hostage situations. <br>  From the book "The Principle of" as if ": a radically new approach to changing your life": <br><br><blockquote>  People who have had to become hostages often develop a strange feeling of affection for their captors.  This effect is surprisingly common - according to the information system of the FBI database on situations with hostages and barricaded persons, some signs of the syndrome show just under a third of the hostages.  Interestingly, this effect usually develops only when the invaders show some degree of kindness to the hostages.  So, the effect may well be the result of the fact that the hostages mistakenly take their anxiety caused by the restriction of their freedom as a sign of sympathy for the kidnapper.  This idea may also help explain why some individuals are attracted to partners who have a bad relationship to them. </blockquote><br>  Moving as though you are a mighty person, you really feel stronger - and this increases your pain tolerance. <br><br>  From the book "The Principle of" as if ": a radically new approach to changing your life": <br><blockquote>  It is noteworthy that those who portrayed the strongest were able to endure tighter cords than those who "rolled into a ball."  The behavior of strong and strong people helped them to discard unwanted emotions and showed that the old expression ‚ÄúAbove the head!‚Äù Is true in the literal sense. </blockquote><br>  But enough theory.  How can all of the above be used in practice to change for the better?  What works? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Ten things worth trying</font> </h2><br>  Wiseman graciously shares the most effective techniques. <br>  From the book "The Principle of" as if ": a radically new approach to changing your life." <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">Motivation: attract and repel</font> <br>  Repulsing an object from yourself (and behaving as if you do not like it), you actually begin to feel antipathy towards the object, whereas, by pulling it towards you (behaving as if you like it), you begin to experience it more positive emotions.  The next time you find yourself face-to-face with a sweet breakfast cereal or chocolate chip cookie, just move the plate away from you and feel the temptation weaken. <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">Dieting: Using a non-dominant hand</font> <br>  When you eat with a non-dominant hand, you are unusual.  Because of this, more attention is paid to action.  There is no mindless eating, so less is eaten. <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">Willpower: strain</font> <br>  When you strain your muscles, it <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-prostykh-sposobov-razvit-silu-voli/">stimulates willpower</a> .  The next time you need to give up a cigarette or a piece of cake, make a fist, tighten your biceps, squeeze your thumb and index finger, or squeeze a ballpoint pen. <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">Perseverance: Sit up straight and cross your arms.</font> <br>  In several experiments, researchers set volunteers with difficult tasks and noted how long they stood.  Those who sat up straight and folded their arms on their chests, held out about two times longer than the others.  Make sure the computer monitor is slightly higher than your eye line, and when it is hard, cross your arms. <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">Confidence: posture force</font> <br>  To increase your self-esteem and confidence, take a position of strength.  If you are sitting, lean back, look up and clasp your hands behind your head.  If you are standing, put your legs flat on the floor, move your shoulders back and chest - forward, and keep your arms in front of you. <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">Procrastination: start</font> <br>  To <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/formula-provala-kak-perestat-sabotirovat-sebya/">cope with self-sabotage</a> , behave as if you are interested in what you are doing.  For a couple of minutes, try to endure what you are avoiding, and you suddenly feel a strong desire to complete the task. <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">Creativity: act outside the box</font> <br>  If you need new ideas, act in a new way.  Take a short walk, but make sure your path is winding and unpredictable.  If this has not activated your creative mind, try acting as if you are a talented artist or sculptor. <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">Justification: Get an approving nod</font> <br>  Researchers have found that when people raise and lower their heads during a conversation (that is, they nod as if they agreed with the arguments), they are more likely to agree with the point of view expressed.  When you want people to agree with you, nod your head slightly when talking.  They will perceive this movement and find that your train of thought strangely attracts them. <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">Negotiations: warm tea and soft chairs</font> <br>  When people think that they are connected with someone, then a physical sensation of warmth arises.  And when you ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù someone with a cup of tea or coffee, it becomes friendlier.  By analogy, hard furniture is associated with heavy behavior.  In one study, participants sat on soft or hard chairs and then discussed the price of a used car.  Those who sat on soft chairs offered a lower price and were more flexible. <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">Guilt: wash away your sins</font> <br>  If you feel guilty about something, try washing your hands or taking a shower.  In several experiments, people who committed an immoral act and then wiped their hands with an antiseptic, felt much less guilty than others. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/vse-chto-nuzhno-dlya-togo-chtoby-razvit-dinamicheskoe-myshlenie/">Everything you need in order to develop "dynamic thinking"</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297974/</a></p>
