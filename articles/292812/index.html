  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thing in itself</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is a saying: ‚ÄúAn extrovert IT person is one who, during a conversation, does not look at his shoes, but at the shoes of the interlocutor.‚Äù  True truth!  We are for the most part deep introverts, with communication skills that are significantly lower than the average human ones.  And our professional activity develops this tendency even more.  Those of us with whom communication is not so difficult, who manage to ‚Äúlet out a part of the pair‚Äù of the pair, quickly get out of control.  This is our interface with the outside world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Our impetuous wordiness, which sometimes erupts in a chamber atmosphere, is deceptive.  It is right next to us to appear a real natural extrovert, as it becomes clear: in the depths of our souls, we do not want and do not know all this.  We do not like big meetings and working groups.  They seem to us empty chatter.  We are much more effective in small groups, and sometimes alone.  To talk, we need some space.  Fighting for him, interrupting and pushing aside other speakers, is an impossible task for our psyche.  When we have to do it, we get clumsily, passionate and rather stupid. <br><br>  Those of us who read a couple of books about the importance of networking for career growth sometimes look funny, trying hard to follow the advice of people made from a completely different test.  In this field, we do not take the volume, pressure, charm.  Like so much else, we need to make it smarter, not bigger and more energetic.  We never fit <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/mif/nevereatalone/">alone</a> .  Such a commitment to us against the coat, it destroys us, deprives the balance and costs us a lot of mental stress.  Because even the most enchanting communication is energy-consuming for us. <br><br>  Sometimes we are damn arrogant.  We love funny (from our point of view) stories about the epic folly of users.  Those, in comparison with which we in human relations are small children.  We are convinced that they do not know how to formulate and do not know themselves what they want.  They are insensitive to our logic, and therefore we sincerely consider ourselves smarter.  So sometimes our wounded pride manifests itself - from being at the very bottom of corporate food chains, from lack of respect for our truly complex, diverse and interesting world and from our inability to tell about it properly.  Forgive us.

      We think badly at a pace, on the go (in the course) of the conversation.  We need to think more thoroughly, our immediate reaction to something really atypical means little.  Elevator speech is not our thing.  We almost never have easy wins.  The process of our thinking is powerful and wide, it is not a game of ping-pong, but the launch of jet aircraft from an aircraft carrier.  We can cool play blitz only when the material is pre-studied and lived.  And often it is.  All our impromptu - the tip of the iceberg. <br><br>  Like fish in the sand, we look helpless in a strange, uncharacteristic role.  Our real life, our drive is completely different.  This is a meditative trance in front of the monitor, lasting hours or weeks.  This is a creative game, an opera in many actions, full of special harmony and special functional beauty.  We are impressed by the complexity of this world and our ability to ride it.  Unthinkable diversity - and our craving to classify and organize.  The multi-caliber of objects - and our striving to collect the whole universe from these cubes.  And not to compare with anything the fledging, when the complex technological solution we produced into the world becomes, in the apt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%2527s_three_laws">expression of</a> Arthur Clarke, indistinguishable from a miracle.  Which lives on by itself.  Without us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7c8/784/14e/7c878414ecb012dbcab2bca37753e125.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292812/</a></p>
