  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Octodon tries his hand at MotoModoStroenii</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  Thanks to those who still follow the news of the development of the company Octodon. <br><br>  After the unsuccessful launch of the campaign on Kickstarter in 2014, our resources and enthusiasm were thoroughly undermined and the project fell into hibernation.  That is, we sawed little by little the technology of 3d-printing octodon production, but in view of the background structure of this process, it is very slow. <br>  Despite this, we still could not get past the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/campaign_collections/transform-the-smartphone-challenge">Transform the Smartphone Challenge</a> contest, announced by Lenovo in conjunction with IndieGoGo, and decided to shake it up a little. <br><br>  Indeed: Lenovo / Motorola's <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/moto-mods">Moto Mods</a> is one of the few modular systems available for smartphones.  Accessories (motorcycle fashion) are interchangeable rear covers, communicating with a smartphone through a proprietary connector.  Changing modules does not require rebooting the phone, and in general, for developers of modules, the system is very convenient.

      And since the Octodon was originally planned as an attachable back keyboard, and even ‚Äúahead of the rest of the planet‚Äù was implemented as an interchangeable back cover for the Samsung Galaxy S, it would be simply unacceptable not to try your hand at motoring. <br><br>  Well, we tried.  Since it was in the vicinity of the day of St..  Valentine, it turned out like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa8/635/b30/aa8635b309244a91a3a74c4435742714.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, this design is based on the working mechanics of the latest telephone prototypes that were developed before Kickstarter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/972/f4b/cb3/972f4bcb32f34fe38ea7b1561f983a25.jpg"><br><br>  But we are considering instead of a folding design and the possibility of implementing a sliding system, similar to our pioneering prototype for the Galaxy S (but much more convenient to use in view of the latest developments). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f31/fad/b73/f31fadb7303a4a4794d13bfbde3d08b1.jpg"><br><br>  If it is possible to solve the issues of production of normal sliding mechanics in small quantities, this implementation has its advantages (all joysticks are hidden when folded, the movement of bringing the keyboard into working state of the valves is more economical) <br><br>  So, with this we are among the finalists of the competition and got the Moto Z Force and the Moto Mods Development Kit (MDK) developer kit - the reference moto mod, by the way, very conveniently implemented.  The reference processor with the necessary strapping is connected via a proprietary connector to the phone, USB connectors are brought to the MDK-mod housing, including the USB-Host connector, and the controller's GPIO feet are connected to a connector to which you can connect so-called  Personality board is a prototype board that implements prototype-specific functions.  In fact - a modular system within a modular system.  It looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd9/fd4/9cb/cd9fd49cbc5c4fa4bf5ccd53af238945.jpg"><br><br>  That is, to realize the flasher with LEDs, work with sensors and much more at the level of the prototype can be very quickly.  And it will even look quite civilized if all the components and bundles of wires fit under the cover.  You can also develop several prototypes with one MDK, and different Personality boards.  Although for the implementation of oktodona, of course, everything is not so fun because of the specific binding mechanics. <br><br>  Architecturally, MDK provides communication mechanisms that notify the application in the smartphone about module changes, the ability to update the firmware of the moto-mode controller from the application, and much more that you have to deal with.  In general, the documentation is rich.  The speed of development is somewhat slowed down by the fact that more detailed information required for developing and calculating the cost of a product (the estimated cost of specific components - connectors, microprocessor, etc., 3D models) falls under the NDA and is not freely available.  To obtain it, you need to get Lenovo partner status.  Therefore, Octodon is now a Lenovo partner. <br><br>  In accordance with the terms of the competition, we launched our fundraising campaign.  And since the relative number of Moto Z users is not too large, we brought to the contest a universal bluetooth model, unchanged from the last Kickstarter.  After all, most of the materials demonstrating the technology were made for it, and collecting and removing a live octodonomotome under conditions of limited preparation time (the projects participating in the competition should start from January 2 to March 6) was not possible. <br><br>  Here are the news. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321936/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321936/</a></p>
