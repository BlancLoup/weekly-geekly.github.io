  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reflections on Personal Information Management</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of years ago I came across an article in which the topic of using PIM in real life was considered. Since then, this topic has not left my thoughts.  I read and thought: here it is the Grail of personal effectiveness.  During this time I have read quite a lot of articles on this interesting topic, but I haven‚Äôt found the only one yet.  The authors of the articles reflect on what it is, this PIM, but no one has a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat it is from itself, nor is there any software that fully implements the ideas of PIM. <br><br>  Ideas in articles on PIM: <br><br>  1. PIM, as a static, structured database of materials of interest to the user. <br>  2. Others focus on organizing data in the form of MindMaps, on which it is convenient to display logical connections, to generate ideas based on the displayed data. <br>  3. PIM, as personal task manager, focused purely on the implementation of the principles of GTD. <br>  4. PIM, as an expert system, in which the knowledge that a user gets in the course of his professional activity is accumulated. <br>  5. PIM, as a diary, in which the user describes his ideas, feelings.  Such a "blog for yourself."

      I will try to formulate my requirements for the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù PIM, as I imagine it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Setting goals and organizing a list of tasks </h2><br>  I'll start a little from afar.  What is motivated by human activity?  There are many theories: biologists, marketers, behaviorists, psychoanalysts, existentialists, etc.  formulated their points of view on this question.  Abraham Harold Maslow is closest to me, he has everything quite simple: a person has a so-called ‚Äúpyramid of needs‚Äù and his activity is motivated by satisfying these needs.  Those.  the basis is need, everything else is primary, secondary, etc.  goals that depend on the education of a person and the traditions of the surrounding society.  It turns out that a person conducts daily continuous activities aimed at achieving goals related to his needs, continuously structures, changes the surrounding space in his favor. <br><br>  For example, the need for protection.  It can be expressed in the form of a goal to have your own home.  This goal needs to be smaller: get a mortgage loan, find a property, make a deal.  These are also quite large goals that need to be broken down into smaller ones: find a job, find a bank, find an agency, etc.  we decompose to the level of feasible goals.  As a result, we get hundreds of small intermediate goals that need to be implemented.  And so for every need. <br><br>  The first task of PIM is to store a multitude of stated intermediate goals on the way to the main goal.  Focusing user attention on current, medium and long-term goals.  To store them in the form of notes, notebooks, in memory is inefficient, unreliable.  Notebooks are lost, tasks are forgotten, it becomes inconvenient to track progress. <br><br><h2>  The accumulation of materials containing useful information </h2><br>  To achieve the goals you need to perform tasks.  You can work as a doctor, designer, architect, programmer, etc.  To perform the tasks, knowledge and some level of qualification are necessary, it will allow you to perform tasks faster, more efficiently and in greater volume. <br>  There is a whole ocean of information related to different areas of activity, but this is untapped, unprocessed information, which in itself will not be of use. <br>  Information can be stored in a variety of forms: books, articles, videos, etc. <br><br>  The second task of PIM: storage of materials related to the scope of tasks performed.  The materials are presented in the form of electronic documents of various formats, videos, audiofiles.  From the materials, a base should be formed, according to which further information can be searched for by keyword. <br><br><h2>  Recycling and analysis of accumulated materials </h2><br>  From the accumulated materials you need to "squeeze" useful information, useful information is usually only 20% of the document. <br>  We need some kind of human-friendly interface for processing a ‚Äúraw‚Äù document into a squeezed note with your notes, notes, and additions. At the same time, you need to perform many small operations: translate text fragments, make notes and comments, move small fragments of text throughout the document, add screenshots. <br>  Similar functionality is implemented in the so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_management_software">Reference Management Software</a> , but this software is sharpened for writing term papers and other scientific works. <br>  Perhaps you need to implement the algorithms of the so-called data mining software. <br><br>  Overall, another PIM task is to provide an interface to the database of electronic documents, which will allow extracting and processing information into a document containing only useful information from the user's point of view. <br><br><h2>  Aggregation of information and task flows </h2><br>  New / important / useful information can come through many channels of ICQ, IRC, Telegram, RSS, e-mail, sms, phone calls, etc.  New input data can initiate new tasks, significantly change the process of performing current tasks, or even make it impossible to complete existing ones.  Therefore, it is important to aggregate all the existing flows, filter out the excess, maybe some even write scripts that will track keywords and perform some actions. <br><br>  Total task: the aggregation of information coming from a variety of sources, the selection of only the information that leads to new tasks or affects the process of implementation of current ones. <br><br><h2>  Accumulation of personal experience </h2><br>  In the process of solving the problem, a script is also created for the solution, which indicates the intended sequence of actions to solve it.  Of course, during the actual execution of the task, the script changes many times and is supplemented with details. <br>  Thus, after completing the task, the solution scenario remains, and if it is rather complicated, it is valuable.  Faced with a similar or similar task in the future, you can extract the existing scenario and apply it to a solution with some changes.  At the same time, the script is supplemented with new details and details. <br><br>  Total pim task: accumulation of experience in solving problems in the form of scenarios for their implementation and related documents, contacts, materials.  Perhaps there should be some kind of Expert system implemented.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AD%D0%BA%D1%81%D0% BF% D0% B5% D1% 80% D1 %82% D0% BD% D0% B0% D1% 8F_% D1 % 81% D0% B8% D1% 81% D1% 82% D0% B5% D0% BC% D0% B0</a> <br><br><h2>  Implementation of the principles of logical information processing </h2><br>  Analysis / Synthesis <br>  Deduction / induction <br>  TRIZ <br><br><h2>  Versatility of the interface </h2><br>  PIM should have an interface and a set of algorithms for processing tasks and information equally convenient for everyone, regardless of the type of tasks and the scope of human activity.  PIM should be convenient to use to a schoolboy, student, artist, photographer, doctor ie  it should be implemented some universal principles for all activities.  Now, basically, a tablet / smartphone is used as a mobile device, so PIM should provide two interfaces for access: from a tablet and a desktop PC.  Perhaps this will be a web interface using ajax, which will work equally with PC and tablet. <br><br>  PIM task: implementation of a universal interface, independent of the scope. <br><br><h2>  Easy, intuitive use </h2><br>  As the author of one article put it, PIM should be ‚Äúat your fingertips‚Äù i.  when using it, it should not be thought that it is easier to write something on a sheet of paper than to open a bulky shell. <br>  Information should be recorded quickly and easily: handwriting, voice, picture right in the process of creating a note. <br>  Algorithms must be perfectly implemented and hidden from the user, all that can be done automatically and eliminate manual work.  The shell must somehow guess the user's intentions and enthrall the process of work. <br><br>  PIM task: ease, intuitive application interface. <br><br><h2>  Delegation of tasks </h2><br>  One person working on achieving the goal is good, a well-coordinated team working on one goal will allow you to achieve much faster and more efficiently, so PIM should ensure the exchange of tasks and knowledge.  Here, PIM becomes something like an ERP enterprise management system. <br>  Perhaps there should be implemented something like a task solution pipeline that passes through several people. <br>  The easiest example is joint purchases.  You and your other half go shopping, the same shopping list is opened on the tablets in which you make notes, you do not have to call up and buy the same thing twice by mistake. <br><br>  PIM task: support user group collaboration. <br><br><h2>  Information Security </h2><br>  PIM should implement information security principles. <br><br>  1) Encryption media that stores all the data structures that creates PIM, to avoid access to information by unauthorized persons. <br>  2) Availability of information.  Those.  you must have access to PIM at any time, as needed, and circumstances should not prevent it. <br>  3) Security of information.  The storage medium must have backup copies.  Those.  loss, theft, damage, breakdown of the carrier should not lead to the loss of all accumulated information. <br><br>  PIM task: preservation and availability of information.  Protection against unauthorized access. <br><br><h2>  PIM Ideas </h2><br>  PIM can significantly improve human performance.  PIM will not replace the brain, but should be its organic continuation, such as an exoskeleton for the brain. <br>  The brain is a workbench on which the current problem is solved, PIM is a huge warehouse of finished products, blanks, templates. <br>  PIM can improve the efficiency of interaction and work in user groups. <br><br><h2>  Software implementation </h2><br>  Now I will write a little about software, which, from my point of view, partially implements the requirements described above.  Free software or paid software with a fairly functional free version is mentioned here. <br><br>  1. File system.  Structure of folders, files, text documents in Word or OpenOffice format.  Rather primitive, but reliable.  It requires discipline to avoid confusion and turning the entire system into a dump of files in which it is impossible to find something useful. <br>  2. Emacs + Emacs org mode.  Close to this system did not work, but judging by the manuals it is a very powerful system, on the basis of which you can realize a lot of what I described.  But there are downsides: the system requires high qualification in working with * nix, the main users of such a system are a computer geek, it does not draw on the versatility of its use by specialists in various fields. <br>  3. Evernote.  Simple enough, intuitive.  Allows you to distribute tasks to several people.  But before starting work you need to create your own system from notebooks, notes, tags.  A good article on the implementation of GTD principles met somewhere on Habr√©.  Storage of a large library of materials is difficult, although once a month, 1G of personal space is allocated. <br>  4. Docear.  The so-called Reference Management Software, focused on scientific activities, mainly writing coursework, doctoral and other scientific works.  It is interesting because it was born from a project to build MindMaps.  Combines the process of accumulating the library of materials with the process of building MindMaps using automatically extracted markup from documents, it is possible to manually change the resulting structure and as a result, generate a document in PDF, DOC, etc.  based on the resulting MindMaps.  In this case, the project is absolutely free.  Here is an interesting video presentation of the project: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDAfcSHxjbM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi62khw1MPS0Pwjp8Db6p5jiiJfEw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  5. WikidPad is quite an interesting multiplatform wiki notepad with the ability to edit data in WYSIWYG mode.  Allows you to create a repository of materials. <br>  6. Thunderbird - I heard about an exotic way to use this email client as PIM.  Notes are implemented in the form of letters.  Tasks are also in the form of letters.  Letters are divided into folders, which allows you to implement work with tasks from different projects separately.  The fulfilled tasks / letters are moved to the appropriate folders.  The library of materials is stored in the form of letters with attachments.  Here it is enough just to send a letter / task to another interested person.  What is the principle of operation resembles work with Evernote. <br>  7. Diary or notebook.  For some time he used a notebook with interchangeable blocks on the rings.  The key point on the rings, because  I conducted each task on a separate sheet and after its implementation moved to the completed section.  It is quite convenient if the place of work is constant and you do not need to move a lot, otherwise there is a high risk of damage and loss, and it is not convenient to use the notebook on the go. <br>  8. Yahoo!  pipes <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">pipes.yahoo.com/pipes</a> , a project that, according to Yahoo experts, will allow to randomly combine, filter, and process information from a variety of Internet sources.  The combination of threads is carried out visually Drug'n'Drop.  You can add your own scripts.  But this project is a long-term construction project, it is still in the testing stage, and it seems that no one represents what it will end up with. <br>  9. Feedly, quite powerful RSS aggregator, well, after Google Reader, of course.  Has the ability to integrate with Evernote. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234837/</a></p>
