The Internet continues to offer consumers an endless range of digital solutions.  Each click, gesture, or mouseover becomes a decision that is made by the user.  The user is constantly faced with a choice: buy or not buy, approve or make fun, tell others or forget, complete or cancel.  You need to know what opportunities should be offered and how they are used by people.  You must understand all the latest and expected devices, platforms, and applications to assess their applicability in your solutions.  You and your team must do everything possible so that Alice falls into the rabbit hole and finds herself in Wonderland. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Strategy - the ability to tie everything together.  It requires you to evaluate past events, real events and make reasonable predictions about the future.  People involved in strategy development should be curious, objective and fearless.  They must take risks, tirelessly pursue their goal and strike accurately and accurately. <br><br>  The UX strategy, or interaction experience strategy (UX, User Experience), lies at the intersection of UX design and business strategy.  This practical methodology increases your chances of creating a successful digital product much more than if you crossed your fingers for good luck, sketched a couple of frame models, and then wrote code. <br><br>  This book provides a reliable basis for the practical application of the UX-strategy.  It is specially adapted for creating innovative products and consists of a series of simple techniques that can be applied regardless of your work environment.  Do not think that the basic principles of business strategy - theoretical knowledge, for the comprehension of which requires a degree in business administration.  Strategy, as well as design, is known only in practice.

    <h3>  Who is this book written for? </h3><br>  This book bridges the gap between UX design and business strategy.  In the course of working on it, I was guided by the following types of product creators: <br><br>  <b>Entrepreneurs, digital project managers and intrapreneur teams.</b>  You want to lead your team ‚Äî designers and UX designers, developers, marketers ‚Äî to create a successful product with outstanding UX quality.  Nevertheless, time, finances and other resources are limited, which means that you will have to direct the efforts of your team to the field of applied simplicity, or the application of the most important and budgetary tools.  You understand the principles of a lean startup methodology and want to save on research and evaluation, if possible, but you also know that decisions must be made on the basis of a conscious strategy.  This book will provide you and your team with the necessary uncomplicated tools for testing proposed value, finding opportunities to create value in the market, and conversion-oriented design. <br><br>  <b>UX / UI designers.</b>  You are depressed.  You feel like a gear in the mechanism, stamping standard solutions.  You would like to make your work more innovative and strategically meaningful, but you are not involved in defining the product at a strategic level.  You are afraid that your career has stalled because you have no economic education or marketing experience.  This book will show how to get on the right path if you find yourself in the following situations: <br><br>  - You have been instructed to create a site map and wireframe models of the product, which you think simply copy the existing product.  You do not want to spend half a year on inventing a bicycle.  This book will tell you how to create innovative value, systematically selecting all the best from the proposals of competitors. <br><br>  - You work with a key participant who is 100% sure of the correctness of his ideas about the product and orders to implement them in this form.  You want to conduct user research to help him move away from the original concept, but he does not allocate a budget for this.  The book will present various options for intrapreneur behavior (‚Äúinternal entrepreneurship‚Äù), with or without the support of management. <br><br>  - You have received a huge document with product requirements;  You are tasked with creating a design that improves conversion.  This book will show how to highlight the stage of user involvement and link the necessary actions with metrics. <br><br><h3>  Why I (Jamie Levy) wrote this book. </h3><br>  Although most of the time I do software design, I decided to write this book primarily because part-time I teach the evolving discipline of UI design and product development strategies.  Since 1993, I have taught courses for a wide range of audiences, from students to working professionals, who wanted to change their profile and get involved in a job more in demand in the labor market.  But all this time I did not have an ideal textbook that would give my students everything they need.  Instead, I had to constantly launch my presentations, sample documents, and templates.  In this book, I put together everything that I know about the UX-strategy, everything that I learned from my work in startups, agencies and large enterprises. <br><br>  I would also like to hope that designers and product creators who are interested in strategy will benefit from my many years of professional experience.  There have been many ups and downs in my career and personal life, and they shaped my attitude towards trial and error.  That is why I didn‚Äôt want to write a dry textbook on business or technology from the very beginning.  I wanted to write a book that would reflect the flexibility and energy of our experience in the real world of product development.  I wanted to reflect the spirit of entrepreneurship, which is not limited to the description of the achieved success or guaranteed working methods.  I wanted to talk about my path in the hope that you will be able to avoid many of the mistakes that I made. <br><br><h3>  Book structure </h3><br>  The presentation of the material in the book is determined by my method of teaching, honed over many years.  Accordingly, you can read the book as it was originally conceived, as a practical guide for creating innovative digital products.  If you choose this approach, it is advisable to have some idea or problem from the very beginning that you want to solve using the digital interface, because you can learn to swim in only one way: jump into the pool and gradually get used to cold water.  As you and your team become familiar with the material in the chapters, you will discover practical methods in a specific sequence.  And then, when you master all these methods, you will be able to apply them in the future in the order that suits you best. <br><br>  The book consists of 11 chapters.  Chapter 1 discusses what the UX strategy is and what it is not.  Chapter 2 presents the infrastructure of the UX-strategy, which will determine the use of all the tools and methods presented in the book.  Chapters 3‚Äì9 will teach you how to apply these UX strategy methods.  Chapter 10 provides four interviews with leading strategy specialists;  they give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãother points of view on the topic.  Finally, chapter 11 summarizes the whole topic in a brief conclusion. <br><br>  ¬ªMore information about the book can be found on <a href="https://www.piter.com/collection/all/product/ux-strategiya-chego-hotyat-polzovateli-i-kak-im-eto-dat">the publisher's website.</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549602577/978549602577_X.pdf">Table of Contents</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549602577/978549602577_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  For Habrozhiteley a 25% discount on the coupon - <b>UX</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325610/</a></p>
