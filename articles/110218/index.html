  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sales of goods and services through applications for Iphone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the moment, applications in the Russian segment of the AppStore can be divided into 4 types by the method of monetization: <br><br>  1. An application that is going to bring happiness to its developer by selling itself <br>  2. The application, as a new communication channel of the Internet sites - money from advertising or other models of monetization of these sites. <br>  3. The application that advertises goods or services - there is no task to monetize, <br>  4. Applications that represent a new sales channel for a product or service. <br><br>  I want to talk about the latter, touching on the experience of Western companies.  I will also give a practical example from a project that I am currently working on.

      To begin with, I decided to write about it and to whom it may be useful. <br><br>  At the moment, I am engaged in the development of new media channels (mainly social media) for <a href="http://mypizza.ru/">the Empire of Pizza</a> company within the AdComm agency, and as part of this activity, an <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id400983642%3Fmt%3D8">application for Iphone</a> was made not so long ago.  Accordingly, there is information, and there is a small but already operational experience of the application that you want to share. <br><br>  <b>To whom this may be useful:</b> <br>  Owners and top managers of companies selling goods and / or providing offline services, who are thinking about launching new sales channels. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  About the audience </h4><br><br>  If we talk about the world, the picture is astounding, namely - Analysts expect to see 100 million users of the Apple iPhone by the end of 2011. This is three times their number at the end of 2009. <a href="http://www.zoom.cnews.ru/news/item/396513">Source</a> <br>  If we talk about Russia, then everything becomes very confusing.  According to official data, <a href="http://www.planetiphone.ru/digest/news2.php">sales of Iphone 3G at the beginning of 2009</a> and <a href="http://www.cybersecurity.ru/hard/103732.html">Iphone 4</a> in total are pulling on 100,000 devices.  Sales statistics 3gs modestly silent.  Suppose that it was something in between, from which we get 150 thousand officially. <br><br>  If we talk about the unofficial - the <a href="http://www.sotovik.ru/news/skolko-iphoneov-v-rossii.html">figures for September 2009 are much more optimistic - 740,000</a> .  And these numbers cause much more confidence.  I regularly see Iphone in people in Moscow and St. Petersburg, this is not such a big bar :) <br><br>  I boldly assume that Iphone users in Russia are no less than a million, and most of them are in Moscow and St. Petersburg. <br><br>  On the social deme of IPhone users can say the following: <br><ul><li>  25% at the age of 23, 18% at the age of 24-29 years. </li><li>  -Iphone does not show its owner‚Äôs income </li></ul>  <a href="http://www.dailycomm.ru/m/10631/">A source</a> <br>  I can only draw conclusions on the behavior of iPhone users on the basis of international research.  Suppose they are more or less correlated with ours. <br>  ‚ÄúAbout 75% of phone owners regularly use e-mail, and 68% go online via Wi-Fi.  37% of iPhone owners look at the device video - this figure is ten times higher than the industry average.  Every fifth user plays online games, and every third uses instant messaging services. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.apple-iphone.ru/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D1%26t%3D3746%26view%3Dunread">A source</a> <br>  Why am I all this?  I mean, we get a million inhabitants of megacities who are technically savvy enough, surf the Internet, use applications, pay with cards (if they buy applications).  These people will definitely do their shopping from their mobile phones. <br>  Moreover, the phone is always at hand, unlike a computer, and this can lead to such pleasant things for the seller as an order from any place and at any time, constant access in a couple of clicks from the buyer, impulse purchases, etc. <br><br><h4>  Western experience </h4><br><br>  Major Western companies have long been in mobile devices and have already reported on their success: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/07/22/amazon-mobile-sales/">Amazon - sold more than 1 billion in a year through mobile devices (including the Kindle)</a> </li><li>  A little not a retailer, but still - <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/30/ebay-expects-to-sell-1-5-billion-worth-of-goods-through-mobile-devices-in-2010/">eBay suggests sales of $ 1.5 billion in 2010 through mobile devices.</a> </li><li>  From the PizzaHut application, orders were <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/business/news/index.cfm%3Fnewsid%3D27614">made for $ 1 million in 3 months from the start of the application</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  In general, in America it is a big trend.  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/02/04/mobile-restaurant-ordering-finally-hits-the-app-store/">Food delivery aggregators</a> , local restaurants such as <a href="http://info.mobilaurus.com/blog/bid/27207/Blue-Ribbon-BBQ-Launches-mobile-ordering-iPhone-App-with-MobiLaurus">Blue Ribbon BBQ</a> or <a href="http://info.mobilaurus.com/blog/bid/25468/Mobilaurus-releases-the-official-Restaurant-iPhone-ordering-APP-for-the-Boston-Kebab-House">Boston Kebab House</a> and <a href="http://info.mobilaurus.com/blog/bid/25860/Supershuttle-releases-reservation-mobile-ordering-iPhone-app-from-Mobilaurus">airport transfer organizers are also</a> released in the AppStore.  The list can be replenished long and hard. <br><br><h4>  What is the situation in Russia? </h4><br>  In Russia, everything is less saturated, but on the other hand, more promising :) <br>  From large retailers, we see a <a href="http://iphone.mforum.ru/pub/2010/26/081423.htm">semi-made application from ozon.ru</a> <br>  From food delivery - <a href="http://www.ru-iphone.com/node/6198">Tanuki, which are very pleased with the results</a> , and, in fact, the <a href="http://macradar.ru/iphone/pizza/">Empire Pizza</a> . <br><br><h4>  Our experience </h4><br>  What results can I tell you.  The application is in the AppStore month.  We started promoting it only from last week.  At the moment, the downloads of the application are only about 2000. At the same time, the application itself is not close to the ideal, and will actively develop further, and now it performs only the basic function - to order food home. <br>  The number of orders from the application is growing by an average of 50% per week.  Began to receive customer reaction, please new features.  At the same time, each installation is not a one-time order, but making contact with a potentially loyal client, and not somewhere else, but in his mobile phone, which is always with you.  Therefore, I very much believe the words of Tanuki‚Äôs remote sales director - ‚Äúthe number of orders is growing exponentially,‚Äù although we are now seeing a progression rather arithmetic. <br>  Now we are collecting statistics, and some time later I will share with you new interesting figures, on the basis of which it is possible to draw conclusions about efficiency. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  So there is a free market.  There are a significant number of users who lack solutions.  Have a positive experience.  And to use this channel or not - you decide. <br>  I would be grateful if you add in the comments, if you know something that I haven‚Äôt told, especially about the Russian experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110218/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110218/</a></p>
