And at least that's why it is interesting;) Meet - acoustic (2.1) laptop system, <b>ASUS uBoomQ</b> .

Postings - meter USB (B) -USB (A), instruction - on 45 pages and as many as 22 languages ‚Äã‚Äã(!), Including Russian. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c27/744/3bb/c277443bb49cda82425b1befeeb607dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And the speakers ... soon, correctly say "column") because it is only one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e4/6db/895/9e46db895379e297159833336b631ffc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  It is somewhat unusual to see such a device.  In any hardware store there are portable speakers and other docking stations for iPods, but in order from the ASUS pen :) Therefore, it even became interesting what would be the result. <br><br>  It will be easiest to describe the device dimensions with the word ‚Äúloaf‚Äù - there were no other analogies at the time of writing the article) A dark matte plastic loaf, assembled carefully enough.  From above and on each side there are oval perforated grilles, behind which speakers and a ‚Äúsub woofer‚Äù are hidden. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/683/6f5/c89/6836f5c89626456f1c27bfbe5b149345.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back is a USB-B connector (as on printers) for connecting to a laptop and a line-in port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15c/a65/31d/15ca6531d261ef123a2bfb81efdc345e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the wire from the kit allows you to remove the sound source from the laptop, I preferred to put them right behind the cover - even because of the netbook, they almost do not stick out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b6/056/8e1/8b60568e1d74ecec1a29de184309f42c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  <i>I have a very simple adapter,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So that in one jack two headphones instead of one.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Very useful for a laptop, if not enough sound.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Imagine: me and my girlfriend;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>On a summer night on the sea - comets fly across the sky;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We have a bottle of delicate something.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Noise waves, a laptop on his lap -</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The volume is full, and you can hear it barely.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So I'll turn on the two headphones in the adapter,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And we will see the movie amicably through them.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And without this little thing about the laptop - as there was never,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And without a laptop - the last century, little romance ...</i> (c) Caste <br><br>  With the connection there is no problem - we take the USB wiring from the kit, connect it to the laptop ... and ... that's it!  The fact that everything went as it should, will signal a blue LED on the speaker housing. <br><br>  We turn on the player on the laptop, turn on some track - the sound will go through the speakers already;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/70a/7d0/9e6/70a7d09e681a11764e2951d30922775c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  About the sound quality.  It just so happened that I already have more or less to compare with) Therefore, honestly and frankly, everything was expected and I was not surprised at all.  But compared to the usual netbook-notebook speakers (regardless of the manufacturer), the sound from this ‚Äúloaf‚Äù is much more interesting and louder.  You know how it happens - ‚Äú <i>Let's put one track on</i> ‚Äù or ‚Äú <i>Guys, have you already seen this video?</i>  <i>Not?!</i>  ‚Äú- you start and see how people in the office start to frown :) Indeed, in a noisy office or somewhere on the road, this sound will not impress anyone.  And here - it will be possible to listen without any complaints, no worse than from office speakers. <br><br>  Naturally, the sound of the speakers through this video will not be understood), but in general, something like this: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rxWcit8FFpY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhtOl-tdxlLswA--B4R7Xk5a__kCA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And yet, it is impossible to compare with office 2.1 - after all, there is much more modest size and weight without additional power +.  The positioning of the device is clearly visible, from where you can easily imagine the scope. <br><br><h2>  Pros and cons will not </h2><br>  <u>Liked</u> : <br>  - Careful attitude to the packaging of the device; <br>  - Matte plastic body, very futuristic appearance; <br>  - Work only from the USB-port - additional power is not required; <br>  - Good sound quality and volume for systems of this class; <br><br>  <u>Did not like</u> : <br>  - Meter wire allows you to distance the speakers from the laptop, but if they are close, it only interferes; <br>  - A carrying case in the kit would not be superfluous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/373/d90/66d/373d9066d94a36e7764e5afd7895145f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is my first acquaintance with devices of this type, so I can‚Äôt talk about the adequacy of the upcoming price (~ 45 coins with the inscription ‚Äú1 Euro‚Äù).  But if you rummage <a href="http://bit.ly/8dEwCA">around</a> on Yandex.Market in portable 2.1-columns (at the time of writing, 14 offers were found in the article), removing those that are not on sale, the price turns out to be very tasty.  Yes, in other models there is ipod support, remote controls and more power ... but there is mains power - then it is much more profitable to take the usual 2.1-acoustics. <br>  Here - mostly sharpening just under the laptop. <br><br><h2>  Opinion man from the next office </h2><br>  - I often take a laptop with me, while occasionally listening to music from it.  I would not carry this device with me - sometimes there is no place in my backpack even for more necessary items.  Yes, and headphones in my case would be preferable.  But for those who have a laptop at home at work, you can safely advise this device - for its unobtrusive dimensions, it sounds great.  Well, or you can take it to nature - it seems it‚Äôs not a pity, but it‚Äôs also with music;) <br><br>  Alternative <a href="http://www.overclock3d.net/reviews.php%3F/audio/asus_uboomq_notebook_speakers/1">review</a> from the Internet. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  The sound quality from such a device was very predictable for me, so there was no surprise screeching :) However, the sound quality is at a good level - better than what notebooks offer, whatever label they would be on.  About tweeters in the phones you can not even talk) <br>  On the other hand, it is rather difficult to come up with something really new in this issue, at least ‚Äúeating‚Äù only from a USB port.  Dimensions, weight - this parameter in such systems, as a rule, in the same range.  Sound quality?  In my opinion, ASUS has everything with these parameters.  Volume?  Perhaps it is even that achievable maximum, which in principle is possible through the USB port without additional power supply. <br>  This device loses in quality (more precisely, loudness) of sound to many loudspeakers of class 2.1, which it is advisable to buy for a stationary computer.  But if you squeeze, do not you take them with you?  ) So if you ever regretted that ‚Äúthere is not enough sound‚Äù or in the near future something like that is coming up - why not;) <br><br><img src="http://trendclub.ru//i/favicon.ico" alt="image">  All news regarding ASUS and Intel first appear on the <b><a href="http://trendclub.ru/">TrendClub</a></b> project - welcome! <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79324/</a></p>
