The whole list is not to be listed otherwise it will already be a system of a distant future, but there are already autonomous cars that themselves overcome the distances themselves without a driver.  Some manufacturers are slowly introducing car warning systems in the "blind" zone of mirrors.  I will make a short description of these systems to understand their narrowly targeted purpose. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>CITROEN</b> <br>  So, on the new Citroen C4 of the 2011 model year, a tracking system for the ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù developed by Bosch appeared. <br>  The system, called Side View Assist, uses ultrasonic sensors similar to those of parking sensors.  Sensors are installed in the corners of both bumpers - front and rear.  The rear, in fact, determine the presence of an object in the blind zone, which the driver does not see in the mirror.  At the same time, the Bosch system is intelligent.  In the field of view of the rear sensors and parked cars, and overtake, that is, those that the driver has already seen and is guaranteed to know about their existence.  But thanks to the front sensors, the system also already knows about these cars and does not respond to them.  But if the car in the "dead zone" appeared imperceptibly for the driver and thus creates a danger, Side View Assist will warn about it.  First, visually, by flashing the LED, and then, if necessary, by sound.  The system is also not active at speeds up to 10 and over 140 km / h. <br>  Side View Assist only warns the driver without interfering with the control of the machine.  However, automakers using Bosch systems as OE components can customize them differently. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sC9FHkVAYM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgVs-wGl4yXYMEZGVLuDkajt26p8Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      <b>Audi</b> <br>  Audi also has a warning system when changing lanes - Audi side assist <br>  The warning system, when rebuilding the Audi side assist, helps the driver when changing lanes.  With the help of radar sensors in the rear bumper, the system monitors movement in the ‚Äúdead zone‚Äù.  If the vehicle is approaching from behind, the LED warning light comes on.  The zone at the side and rear of the car is monitored by radar sensors at speeds above 30 km / h.  If there is a car in the ‚Äúdead zone‚Äù or it is rapidly approaching from behind, the LED signal lights up in order to warn the driver in the corresponding external rear-view mirror.  If the turn signal is on in this situation, the LEDs in the mirror start flashing, warning the driver about the danger of a collision.  The Audi side assist system does not actively interfere with driving, the driver can turn it off at any time by pressing the button on the driver's door. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZCOWkLSf3kY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhivGDQ743t6DOZ-0axg_sgo7TyrUA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Volvo</b> <br>  Volvo also keeps abreast of innovations from 2005, and will begin to provide, as an option on some models, a system warning the driver about cars or motorcycles in the danger zone - right and left, directly behind the car. <br>  The BLIS system consists of video cameras that take 25 frames per second, mounted on exterior rear-view mirrors and a computer that detects objects in these zones, 3 x 9.5 meters each. <br>  In the event of a dangerous approach, the system lights the yellow LED in the cabin - next to the right or left mirror, respectively. <br>  The complex tracks the cars that go for overtaking, and also reacts to those cars that, on the contrary, move more slowly, for example, those that fall into the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility during rebuilds. <br>  At the same time, the system does not respond to static objects that are in the field of view of the cameras, for example, when the driver reverses, setting the car in the parking lot.  Cameras are activated at speeds greater than 10 kilometers per hour. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wVZbukIKCIA&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiEELL1gLhaP3ZEPZTHtqppK2bcqw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Siemens LIDAR</b> <br>  The problem of ensuring safety in poor visibility - during fog, rain and snow - remains relevant to this day.  Without seeing a stopping car in front of him, the driver may not have time to press the brake pedal in time and stop.  To solve this problem, Siemens VDO has improved its earlier development - adaptive cruise control (ACC), teaching him to recognize the brake lights in front of the car and to work effectively in fog, rain and snow.  This was achieved thanks to the introduction of the LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor into the ACC system, which will make the system cheaper. <br>  Structurally, the LIDAR sensor consists of an infrared radiation source, a photodiode that serves as a receiver for the reflected rays of invisible infrared light, and electronics that process information.  The sensor continuously monitors the propagation time of the infrared rays emitted and reflected from the obstacle.  With this information at its disposal, the electronics calculate the change in the distance to the vehicle in front.  The LIDAR sensor is also able to detect particles of water (fog, rain).  On the basis of what the electronics makes a conclusion about poor visibility and makes a decision to reduce the speed.  To this end, the electronics can reduce engine speed and apply brakes.  The improved system also distinguishes vehicles from real estate. <br>  LIDAR is not afraid of rain, fog or snow - the laser beam pierces them to a distance of 250 m, which is quite enough.  And the computer that processes the reflected signal is so ‚Äúsmart‚Äù that it distinguishes moving objects from stationary ones. <br>  The algorithm of the driver is as follows.  Having occupied the desired lane, it sets the speed, which the tempomat maintains automatically.  In the event of a dangerous approach to the vehicle in front, the speed is automatically reset so as to maintain a safe interval.  The "trick" of the system is that this interval is determined not only by speed, but also ... by weather conditions.  If LIDAR notices that it is raining or snowing, the distance will be increased! <br>  What, however, until the system is able to - react to the suddenly impudent burglar in front of you, instantly violating all the calculations.  Well, that's what the driver behind the wheel.  Otherwise, the ride will be too boring. <br><br>  <b>More functional systems</b> <br><br>  <b>Projection display on BMW windshield</b> <br>  One second and 28 meters.  This is exactly what is required in order to translate the view from the road and read the speedometer at a speed of 100 km / h.  A full-color dashboard on the windshield projects the current speed reading directly into view on the windshield.  And BMW ConnectedDrive technology allows even more.  High Guiding and Lane Guiding are the names of features that simplify navigation in cities and on hard-to-see road markings.  A high-resolution, full-color image is projected onto the windshield directly into the driver‚Äôs field of vision.  If necessary, the Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãLimit Info feature can display the current speed limit along with the status of the current speed limits in the region.  Also, warning signs of help systems are always displayed, such as warnings about dangerous rebuilds and warnings about going off the lane, warnings about recognizing pedestrians by the BMW night vision system, and also warning about the likelihood of a collision with the rear of the car in front. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5Lug71nOA4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjRql2GB6hFE1IHYpnr7Df8i__gFg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Mobileye</b> <br>  Special attention is given to the technology presented by Mobileye, since 1999 they have been using mono-cameras and have achieved excellent results in ‚Äúmachine vision‚Äù.

So that she could collect data from many sensors, analyze them and provide the driver with the opportunity to make a decision or switch on the full or partial intervention mode.  But for this, the car should be completely under the control of the computer, and not those weak similarities of the calculator that are built into modern cars.  Information should come to the screen and be controlled by touch or voice (the cost of LCD panels is cheap now, and the sensor is no surprise now, and Google‚Äôs voice recognition is generally high), I even presented transparent information strips of OLED displays pasted on the front and side windows output important information (top or bottom), although BMW has projection displays, but they are not clearly visible during the day. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/371/b92/019/371b92019218f1d99993d31e034149e0.jpg"><br>  OLED displays <br><br>  And let's look further and presented that such a system exchanges information with other cars and data centers on the road, from where it receives important information about the condition on the road about other cars on the road.  This is already a single network between cars - autonet.  Such a network will help notify other road users about the accident that occurred.  Traffic police will facilitate the search for stolen cars.  Enumerate the advantages of this technology can be very long.  By making a software based system, you can add functionality.  ‚ÄúThis is not for our roads,‚Äù you say, this is exactly what we need.  Many accidents occur at pedestrian crossings when a standing car in a nearby lane closes a passing pedestrian.  Obtaining information about the movement of people around this car, you can avoid fatal accidents.  Many accidents occur in rain, snow or fog in low visibility, a laser beam, radar or wireless information from cars in front will help create information on the mini-map on the position of cars on the road and avoid collisions.  Many people fall asleep at the wheel and die, and with the help of autonet any abnormal car deviation will be recorded and transferred to the sleeping driver.  Perhaps these are dreams, but without them there is no progress. <br>  Is this fiction that we see in films about the future?  All of this technology can be implemented today, and reduce the death rate on the roads.  I think the problem is in car companies that want to make a lot of money.  Over the past 30 years, and maybe more, cars change only externally.  Auto giants are introducing miserable, single functions so slowly that the described functionality may be achieved by 2050. <br><br>  In the meantime, be careful on the road and take care of your life and the lives of others, we have one. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150053/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150053/</a></p>
