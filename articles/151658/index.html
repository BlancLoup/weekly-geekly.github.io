Many respondents participating in public opinion polls confessed that they would rather leave the house without a wallet than without a telephone.  However, with the popularization of contactless payment technologies, the smartphone will be quite capable of replacing the contents of the purse with you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/52c/7bb/3ee/52c7bb3ee553eb8c78bc8b964165b32b.jpg"><br><br>  With the development of mobile communications, the requirements for it from the end users have multiplied.  The penetration of cellular networks has also steadily increased, and it is much easier to meet people with several phones in large cities than they do without them. <a name="habracut"></a>

      If you have a personal number where conversations are carried out with relatives and friends, friends and relatives, you would hardly want to change it.  However, many companies resort to corporate services to optimize and control communication costs, and this automatically means receiving another SIM card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a3/1d6/3c3/1a31d63c39da180715fc0282af2a3370.jpg"><br><br>  Let two phones may seem safer from the standpoint of probability theory, but in terms of convenience and practicality, this is far from being the case.  It is necessary to monitor the status of data synchronization on both devices, to charge them in time and so on.  In the end, one device can be accidentally forgotten or lost, which will result in a waste of time, possible fines and unplanned expenses. <br><br>  Of course, manufacturers could not respond to the situation and demonstrated a number of solutions that can work with two SIM-cards.  Over time, these devices occupied their niche, but, as a rule, they never went beyond the budget segment. <br><br>  With the release of HTC Desire V, the alignment of forces has changed.  The device, capable of working with two SIM-cards, has never before been presented to the market in such an elegant guise.  Equipped with support for all modern cellular bands, the Desire V is only 9 mm thick, and its dimensions are 118.5 mm long and 62 mm wide, respectively.  The device weighs 114 g, leaving a pleasant feeling of quality materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ee/1a1/f8d/3ee1a1f8d9594385fbfa8af3ed096180.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c63/c2f/577/c63c2f5773f9d0086eb65a5eaf249245.jpg"><br><br>  The smartphone runs on Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich, and the convenience of working with it provides a proprietary shell HTC Sense 4.0.  Responsiveness of the device provides a combination of components such as the Qualcomm MSM7227A chipset, supporting ARM v7 instruction set, as well as 512 MB of RAM.  Built-in at the same time provided 4 GB, and another 25 GB you get in the form of cloud storage, represented by the popular service Dropbox.  The period of free use of this space is 2 years, but after the expiration of the time the files will not be deleted, it will not be possible to download new ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/389/259/1c0/3892591c0dbda9b94e099e5fe397edac.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f26/77e/684/f2677e68459feda98b537b43e39c9ba1.jpg"><br><br>  Bright and high-quality TFT-display with a diagonal of 4 "and excellent viewing angles built on technology SuperLCD, which guarantees realistic color reproduction and decent behavior in the sun.  The screen resolution is standard for these sizes and is 800x480 pixels, which allows you to run any popular games and applications without worrying about possible compatibility issues. <br><br>  The five-megapixel camera is equipped with autofocus and LED flash, and its interface is as convenient as in models of the One series.  Autonomy provides a battery capacity of 1650 mAh, so you can safely count on a full day with active use and up to two days in case of moderate use. <br><br>  If you are interested in the tests passed by the device, as well as more detailed characteristics, we ask you to familiarize yourself with the results of the popular benchmarks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/625/aec/45a/625aec45acc3ea0b395af4f2ce0cf0cd.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/195/23b/835/19523b83572d842179d95d264f59d191.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/249/cf2/04b/249cf204b404542aaccfc6806a2d005f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f7/a9e/5b9/7f7a9e5b900365a0628345caa93e4514.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/909/ff1/482/909ff1482564310be35acf6bacb502f0.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7fb/f7b/5d7/7fbf7b5d7a5b9d2e7df72fa4354ce45e.png"><br><br>  Having distracted from studying of TTKh, we will pay attention to the device.  Already mentioned subtlety combined in it with the usual features, and with the move Desire V can be mistaken for One S, and this comparison is definitely for the benefit of the new product.  Taking into account the diagonal of the display, the smartphone should be considered compact, and it is guaranteed to be easy to use with one hand, and you will not have to make any effort to reach the notification bar and the top edge of the screen. <br><br>  The thoughtful form of the case will not allow to miss a call if the device is on the table.  The back wall is slightly concave, so the sound from the ringing speaker will only increase, reflecting from a flat surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/718/a6b/ae5/718a6bae57ea05fbc805c990d46decc3.jpg">  Taking the phone in hand, you immediately feel the volume rocker, located on the right side, and you will find the power button, the place for which was found in the center of the upper edge.  To fill the device with various accessories, you only need to easily pry the back cover and gently separate it from the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d62/a60/295/d62a60295dcbe33e63b57aa2ba3ab31f.jpg"><br><br>  Your attention will open two slots for SIM-cards, which are mirrored relative to each other, and the connector for the ‚Äúflash drive‚Äù of the format microSD (supported media up to 32 GB) logically complements the picture.  Just in case, we give instructions with a clear illustration of the correct fit of the cards to the designated places: http://www.htc.com/help/ru/howto_iframe.aspx?id=188375&amp;type=1&amp;p_id=453. <br><br>  As you can see, there is nothing difficult in this, but you can forget about a card or a second phone for calls placed under the back cover, as if you had a bad dream.  It is enough to reboot the device (‚ÄúQuick boot‚Äù is enabled by default, so this procedure takes a few seconds) and, if necessary, enter PIN codes in order to fully enjoy the advantages of two SIM cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c99/763/cc7/c99763cc7036812b867baf71c23b8fac.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/06c/b45/7ac/06cb457acf07911d4629d7be78f9f119.png"><br><br>  A special section of settings is devoted to working with them, named just as ‚ÄúNetwork Manager‚Äù.  With it, you can set the preferred operator, enter arbitrary names for each card (up to 5 characters, so that the full name is guaranteed to appear in all menus) or disable one of them if necessary.  In addition, deactivating all wireless connections mode "In the plane" is now duplicated in this menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/feb/6da/ec5/feb6daec563f26af03671ea6d05c3d38.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a45/35c/b14/a4535cb143fac81b6f0997c29d8a7fe9.png"><br><br>  Going deeper into the settings, you can check the actual data transfer parameters, as well as launch a manual search for available networks or allow data transfer in roaming, if the tariff option or package allows it.  The cards will be named as it is convenient for you, but you need to keep in mind that Internet access at 3G speeds is available only in the first slot, and the second will allow you to communicate without restrictions using traditional methods.  Of course, the replenishment in the camp of SIM-cards was also reflected in the contents of the ‚ÄúUsage‚Äù section, containing information about data consumption and SMS accounting.  Switching between the cards, you can easily track the costs of each of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/910/17a/238/91017a238d64f61f87a4f57fd5661cc4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f2/947/ddc/6f2947ddc9b134b4b853cfbe1cd2b40b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/633/d75/087/633d750878db1314adfca025404bfaca.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e2/9c2/273/8e29c2273a1a1509ab69afe9c404f53c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e6/878/48b/7e687848b8afc9022fdea9ada2d198fa.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/413/066/183/4130661837858e6c10bce6335f5829e6.png"><br><br>  A tool for managing SIM-cards organically fit into the familiar design of the interface Sense, and all its wealth and beauty at your service.  Excellent personalization capabilities, coupled with access to the HTC Hub service, will allow you to choose exactly the design elements that you would like to see, and if you wish, you can easily change them for something fresher. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/309/65b/044/30965b044c0caf070f662a21131e1c32.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b7/a1a/b3a/7b7a1ab3a3cd3e3f563ba3b64105927d.png"><br><br>  Even if you pay increased attention to the phone, you can not worry about the level of charge until late in the evening.  For example, in the conducted test Desire V played YouTube video for almost 4 hours, and the display brightness was maximum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d20/d0e/a4d/d20d0ea4d03f196a15ceaee3b92c1398.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/185/869/afc/185869afc06d9bb7c5b0a0a0ca37d3e0.png"><br><br>  Integration of contacts from both SIM-cards and connected accounts works like a clock, and if necessary, it will not be difficult to copy contacts to the desired account or transfer them from one memory card to another, deleting random duplicates at the same time.  Of course, there is also the possibility of combining disparate information on one person into a single card, facilitating the search and sorting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef8/820/924/ef88209249623a3c95075354cb4ce58f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e77/ea6/e88/e77ea6e8881260518158ffd41830d15b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/178/05a/4bf/17805a4bf01adf10692048949d01ab4d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/894/22c/950/89422c950a65cf8404d6772ffe80d8c4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/13d/e7f/fe9/13de7ffe9a5391686c24e97ad90bdcae.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/962/326/d37/962326d374f7e80c244e6a0e7042c01c.png"><br><br>  Along with services running with a Google account, you have the potential to synchronize with a Microsoft account.  It is enough to create an account on http://outlook.com, how to conduct correspondence and schedule meetings will be possible with its help directly from your smartphone, while using standard applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/548/046/c33/548046c333168f37df0e05c08b1be461.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f9/310/58d/2f931058df1f9ae77df88fda32e1aeb2.png"><br><br>  Do not think that all the specifics of the device is exhausted in a single section of settings.  The familiar SmartDial dialer now contains not one, but two call-sending buttons, corresponding, respectively, for each of the SIM-cards.  As soon as the choice is made, the second card will become inactive due to the use of a single radio module, but upon completion of the conversation it will immediately turn on, not leaving you without connection for a second. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/857/601/0a3/8576010a35d275d638c83517c43bed8b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d1e/7a3/9bb/d1e7a39bb51cbfbc268d01d81498c462.png"><br><br>  In addition, received and sent messages are marked with a small, but informative icon indicating which card was being corresponded with.  Thus, despite the presence of two slots in one device, its interface did not become confusing or inconvenient, and the algorithms of operation are logical and simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bde/b1d/e4e/bdeb1de4e78c7144b495d65e90500fbf.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/380/a17/5f0/380a175f05c9f729e9176bcbce4dc0ba.png"><br><br>  With examples of photos you can find on the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bjgsnzaxhd447pt/EPfzY5Z2Uk">link</a> .  The source of the images was a test sample, while the quality of images obtained with commercial samples promises to be more balanced. <br><br>  Example video 800x480: <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZqOAdg2Kg2Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg-CKT94wVNmDvFwuTta8mSTjrEow" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e8/028/825/6e8028825b145811a876666666377df4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/814/7f1/1a7/8147f11a715b08ff4870cf0d1bba6dac.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e01/36f/e51/e0136fe5114f25b0db23a3c253480efe.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/60c/3ee/959/60c3ee959533ca0da0eddf521f4d5b5e.png"><br><br>  Music player will appreciate the updated interface and support for Beats Audio.
