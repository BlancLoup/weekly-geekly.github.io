      In SearchInform, he came to the position of a programmer in 2013 and worked on projects ProgramSniffer, Keylogger, ReportCenter as part of DLP.  In 2014, he became the team leader, after a year and a half he took the lead in developing all the company's products. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What do you do in the company?</b> <br><br>  As a development manager, I have to communicate a lot with specialists from different departments - from programmers, testers and technical support staff to managers, marketers and company management.  We develop three products - DLP-system, SIEM-system and time control program.  I am responsible for the development of the entire product line, so I perform managerial functions (I discuss the priorities for the development of the tasks and development directions with the management), and I also deal with technical problems and coordinate programmers. <br><br>  In addition, I write some critical parts of the code.  I work with what remains from the time when I was a programmer, but did not have time to transfer.  Usually, day to day is not necessary, but in general I manage to talk on average with 30 or more people. <br><br>  We solve various issues with the team: what to do if something does not work, how to write it better, set priorities, choose the best algorithms, discuss bugs and fix them, and so on. <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br><br>  Quickly. <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you spend on work?</b> <br><br>  About 10 hours. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  8 ocloc'k. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br><br>  Periodically, my breakfast is floating - between 8 and 12 hours. <br><br>  <b>What are you doing on the way to / from work?</b> <br><br>  I work in one of the remote offices of the company - in Rostov.  Those 15-20 minutes that I walk to work, I do nothing, listen to the radio or music. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  For personal tasks, I use the Sublime Text plugin. <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can't you do without?</b> <br><br>  If applications, then this is Skype, Far, if web services, then these are various online converters, calculators, password retrieval services, that is, those that I need to perform auxiliary tasks. <br><br>  <b>What kind of task manager / issue tracker / repository do you use in the company?</b> <br><br>  Redmine and the Git repository. <br><br>  <b>What other tools and software do you use at work?</b> <br><br>  My work environment is made up of several compilers, environments, four of which are for programming.  Some more DBMS.  And I use all this on one virtual machine.  This makes it possible to quickly migrate from one host computer to another. <br><br>  <b>Does the company have internal projects?</b> <br><br>  Domestic projects - task tracker, CRM, kanban-board, automation, distribution and so on.  We write and support all this on our own, mainly to ensure the security and high speed of ‚Äúreaction‚Äù to internal requests. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when you work?</b> <br><br>  Most annoying when distracted.  For example, when you are involved in the process and the Skype call is ringing.  Someone can refuse, but someone can not answer.  It is very annoying. <br><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  Each development area requires its own literature.  But there is a professional classic: for system programming - Jeffrey Richter;  for algorithms, data structures - Knut. <br><br>  An interesting database review book - <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/19383907/">‚ÄúSeven databases in seven weeks.</a>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/19383907/">Introduction to modern databases and the ideology of NoSQL</a> . <br><br>  I also recommend the Gang of Four.  From online resources I regularly visit Habrahabr, Stack Overflow.  If I need something specific, then I search on Google. <br><br>  <b>What do you prefer: electronic reading rooms or paper books?</b> <br><br>  At home I read paper books, on business trips - electronic ones.  But it's just a matter of convenience. <br><br>  <b>What technique and why do you prefer at work and at home?</b> <br><br>  There are no preferences in this matter.  I stopped watching ‚Äúiron‚Äù for a very long time.  Most importantly, it satisfies my needs - speed, memory, screen resolution.  Now I have a Hewlett-Packard computer, but this does not mean anything.  For me, in a computer, among other things, the characteristics of the monitor and quiet operation are important. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br><br>  When I work, I listen to the radio, where the presenters do not speak, but the background is music: usually it is Russian performers.  I like to work under Vysotsky. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  I have one - not to be distracted by trifles. <br><br>  <b>What kind of professional advice for the future can you give yourself?</b> <br><br>  This advice, rather, to my own past, I cannot say anything about the future.  And to myself five years ago I would say: ‚ÄúUse other technologies‚Äù.  After all, most of the code that the developer writes, after a while, he himself often recognizes, to put it mildly, as ineffective.  Today everything would have done differently. <br><br>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  Do not give in to what you fundamentally think is wrong.  Defend your position, no matter what. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321020/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321020/</a></p>
