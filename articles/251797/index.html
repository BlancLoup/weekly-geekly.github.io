  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Static hosting: life after death narod.ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One day I discovered that narod.ru, our everything in the field of the history of the Runet and the inexhaustible storehouse of vyrglaznyh sites, sold out!  Ucoz bought it.  Small trouble, I thought, after I re-registered all my old sites under ucoz and for a while forgot about the problem.  But just recently having learned about the existence of a <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">plethora of</a> static site generators, I decided to make another site about anything.  What was my surprise when it turned out that Ucoz.ru no longer supports uploading html files, dooming you to use its site builder against your will. <br><br>  Of course, you can buy hosting for a couple of dollars a month, you can find free hosting with perl, php and mysql.  You can even keep up with the achievements of the time and use the heroku or google app engine, getting into the load also the support of advanced programming languages.  But all this is not that.  No soul.  How can a lamp upload of updates via FTP be compared to a soulless publication with a single click in Wordpress?  Can not.  That is why let's see where and how today you can make a static site. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><h2>  A bit of argumentation </h2><br>  Static sites are still in demand.  Yes, after a large part of small and ultra-small businesses moved to VKontakte, the need for such sites faded.  But in terms of promotion, any site is still preferable than the group on VKontakte (in any case, I want to believe in it).  What does a client need?  Information about the company, price, examples of work performed, a list of products, delivery terms and contacts for more details.  Everything.  This will be enough for a studio, small wholesale base, toast-master, city library, cargo transportation, real estate agency, photographer, delivery of hot lunches, etc.  Here, free hosting and statics are perfect, without creating extra costs for hosting, domain and frames.  Especially since patching security holes in the code of open engines, in which sites for specified cases are made in 99% of cases, this is also labor-intensive.

      A separate class is the original local history sites, where someone either uploads photos of his native village and family archives, or keeps a diary of how he grows apricots in the conditions of the Far North.  This is partly favored by the fact that the average person starts learning web design with books that are in a store that doesn‚Äôt understand how quickly everything is becoming obsolete in this industry.  So, in the outback, according to some tutorial HTML of 2007, the year of release will be studied in 2020. From the point of view of security, free hosting is also a good option.  Not all hosting is of course, but it is very difficult to find abandoned sites on a paid hosting older than 3 years.  Guess why. <br><br>  In fact, this is a big problem - information is lost over time.  With all its flaws, narod.ru is what made it possible to create your website so that it stood for 10 years unattended - this is its main value.  Folk sites are still the place where you can find rare photos, documents, diaries, old versions of programs, etc.  A lot of information on almost any topic - just add inurl to the google request: narod.ru. <br><br>  No, but the truth is, if you know something / know, then where can you share it?  Suppose you know how <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/217309/">to catch hedgehogs</a> , and the more you do not know how, where you put it?  To the VKontakte page, where will nobody find it?  In a group of fans of hedgehogs of the same contact, which is likely to disappear in vain in a couple of years?  Maybe go to the forum of annuals, where the moderator will generally condemn you for cruelty to animals?  The example is exaggerated, but the average person in general learns little of his value in his life, what he could share with the rest for the benefit of others.  For a whole blog is definitely not enough.  But on a one-page site with well-placed keywords - completely.  In addition, if you are so concerned about the importance of your message to humanity, then mirroring static sites is not like dynamic ones. <br><br><br><h2>  Where to host? </h2><br>  Only hosters that do NOT support the execution of any scripts on the backend will be listed in this list.  Because, firstly, the post is not about this, and secondly, if you wish, you can google it in 5 minutes, well, and thirdly, I have not yet met a stable free hosting service with PHP, which would not fall off several times a week thanks to june talents, who are trying to deploy everything there - from irc-bots to password bruteforcers.  Resources are hosted to such servers by the residual principle, so it should not be surprising that sometimes even static will not be given. <br><br>  If you know other hosting providers that provide pure static hosting without scripts, then I‚Äôll be happy to add them. <br><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://free.1gb.ua/">free.1gb.ru</a> </h3><br><ul><li>  Free domain in ru.  Yes, second level domain.  But there is a reservation: </li></ul><br>  One project is randomly registered according to the results of one-hour bids.  You receive a notification about the results of your registration. Among those who have not passed the hourly quota, within the framework of the additional quota, socially significant projects are registered at the end of the day based on the descriptions provided. <br><br><ul><li>  no ads </li><li>  1 Gb places </li><li>  3 mailboxes, POP3 / SMTP </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://free.1gb.ua/">free.1gb.ua</a> </h3><br><ul><li>  Free domain in cc.ua, ltd.ua, inf.ua </li><li>  no ads </li><li>  Free hosting of 1 Gb </li><li>  3 mailboxes, POP3 / SMTP </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities.org</a> </h3><br><ul><li>  Free domain in neocities.org </li><li>  no ads </li><li>  50 MB of space and 50 GB of monthly traffic </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://parse.com/">parse.com</a> </h3><br><ul><li>  Free domain at parseapp.com </li><li>  20 Gb of space + 20 GB in the database, no more than 30 requests per second, 2 Tb of traffic </li><li>  own deployment CLI </li><li>  Database on js with access control system by lists (ACL) </li><li>  Ability to perform predefined functions on the server (sending mail, etc.) </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://divshot.com/">divshot.com</a> </h3><br><ul><li>  Free domain in divshot.io </li><li>  no ads </li><li>  100 MB of space and 1 GB of monthly traffic </li><li>  deploy with CLI tools based on nodejs </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.bitballoon.com/">www.bitballoon.com</a> </h3><br><ul><li>  Free domain at bitballoon.com </li><li>  form filling support - all sent forms are saved to the service database, no code is needed on the backend </li><li>  API for the site - for example, you can, for example, request all data from the completed forms to create a report once a day. </li><li>  API client for Ruby and JS, but no FTP support </li><li>  traffic and volume restrictions not specified </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://getforge.com/">getforge.com</a> </h3><br><ul><li>  Free domain in getforge.io </li><li>  no ads </li><li>  5 GB of traffic per month, how much space is not clear </li><li>  Dropbox sync </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.paperplane.io/">paperplane.io</a> </h3><br>  Registration only via twitter / facebook / github.  Requires binding to Dropbox.  Restrictions on the location and traffic like no. <br><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://admin.qsl.net/">qsl.net</a> </h3><br>  Static hosting for amateur amateur sites.  There are no restrictions on the size of the site.  But you still won‚Äôt get as many scanned datasheets. <br><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://pages.github.com/">pages.github.com</a> </h3><br><ul><li>  Free domain in github.io </li><li>  no ads </li><li>  1 GB of space, the limit on the file - 100 MB </li></ul><br>  There is also hosting from <a href="http://pages.bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a> .  Too program-specific solutions. <br><br><br><h2>  Interactivity problem </h2><br>  If you do not have a backend, then you are limited in the method of obtaining information from site visitors.  And you have several ways around this limitation: <br><br><ul><li>  Creating a form in google docs and integrating links to it into the site code. </li><li>  Use <a href="http://www.typeform.com/">typeform</a> service for forms. </li><li>  Use <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus">Disqus</a> for comments. </li><li>  Use free community <a href="http://ixbb.ru/">forums</a> . </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  It's 2015, and static sites can still be useful and you can even make money on them.  There is a huge number of generators of static sites - in many respects this is the merit of github pages, but even when the hyip will come to naught all the programs will remain.  And who knows, maybe by that time there will again appear some long-lived free hosting provider, the site on which will live longer than your cat, to whom this site was dedicated. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251797/</a></p>
