  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A little bit about Sberbank</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inspired by my trips to Sberbank over the past six months ... <br><br>  Explain why the main state bank of the country can afford to hire stupid workers and score on their training?  Why can different software be installed on computers in different cities (even in different departments in the same city)?  Why in general in different branches of the same bank are the principles of work radically different from each other? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The situation is as follows: <br><br>  Every month I send a small amount of money to my brother, who is studying in St. Petersburg.  Since my brother has a Mastercard card from Sberbank, it is quite logical that I put money on it.  Upon receipt of the card, the brother was given a piece of paper with the requisites with which you can put money on this card.  In this piece of paper:

      <b>Payee's bank:</b> <br>  North-West Bank of Sberbank of the Russian Federation <br>  St. Petersburg <br>  To / from bank 00000000000000000000 (20 figures) <br>  BIC 000000000 (9 digits) <br><br>  <b>Recipient:</b> <br>  INN 0000000000 (10 digits) PPC 000000000 (9 digits) <br>  "Management of Bank Cards of North-West Bank of the SB of the Russian Federation" <br>  R / s 00000000000000000000 (20 digits) <br>  OKPOO 00000000 (8 digits) OKONH 00000 (5 digits) <br><br>  <b>Purpose of payment:</b> <br>  Transfer to a card account <br>  Maestro No. 0000 0000 0000 0000 (16 digits) <br>  addressed to Ivanov Ivan Ivanovich <br><br>  First, explain why so much data?  I am transferring money to the same bank!  My opinion - you need ONLY the card number to uniquely identify the recipient.  Can there be two cards, even from different banks, with the same numbers?  Anyway.  Now briefly about the process: <br><br>  <u>Month 1.</u> <br>  I come to the bank ( <i>branch 1</i> ). The operator has been trying for a long time to understand what I want from him.  Having understood, long delves into his program.  Says: "The data is incomplete, you need a customer account number."  I pointed to the card number, he said "no, there is still an account number."  Calls the head.  She comes up, explains that he is trying to enter data from the third attempt, gives him to sign papers, cry, leave.  After 3 days the transfer comes. <br><br>  <u>Month 2.</u> <br>  <i>Branch 1.</i> Another operator.  "Incomplete data ...." The head, data driving, payment, leaving.  Translation comes. <br><br>  <u>Month 3.</u> <br>  <i>Branch 2.</i> Operator: ‚ÄúThe branch number of the beneficiary bank is needed‚Äù.  I: "O_o."  I explain that already sent.  Head: "We need a branch number, otherwise we do not know where to send."  She doesn‚Äôt care for the explanations: ‚ÄúYou apparently sent it to another department, we have different programs on computers‚Äù.  I am trying to figure out how these are - different programs, since the bank is one, I do not get a clear answer.  I contact my brother, find out the number of the branch, write it down, give them to them.  Scoring data.  A week later, the translation is still not reached.  Returning to the bank - where, they say, transfer.  ‚ÄúAnd you know, he came back.  Wrong data".  It turned out that the operator mixed up the fields, where to drive something.  I send again.  Translation comes. <br><br>  <u>Month 4.</u> <br>  <i>Branch 3.</i> Incomplete data ... Head: "We need an account number."  Already wearily explaining what is not needed, look for how to send.  After 5 minutes, around the operator are 4 people and are together looking for how to send.  Find the same, send.  Translation comes in 4 days. <br><br>  <u>Month 5. January</u> <br>  <i>Branch 1.</i> Incomplete data!  Head (already new): need an account number!  Trying to stay calm.  I explain that it is not needed, I have already sent it 4 times, including from their bank.  Name is two more people.  One guy, apparently the smartest, first says that it was never possible to send it like that (yeah, right), then he says that the program has been updated since January, and now you cannot send it without an account number.  The manager picks up: ‚Äúaha, carry the account number, then we will send‚Äù There is no force to swear, I leave.  The next day I go to another branch: <br>  <i>Branch 4.</i> Need account number!  And wait, here he is, on your paper.  (I - O_o).  Quickly clogs the data, pay, leave.  After 10 days there is no money on the card.  I'm going to understand.  The head: ‚ÄúOh, the translation is back.  That account number is the account number of the bank, not the client, the bank does not know where to put the money. ‚Äù  I give the same piece of paper, quickly fill in the data (without account number !!!), send. <br><br>  After 6 days I come - where is the money again?  Head: "I do not know anything, the translation did not return."  He calls somewhere, asks for another piece of paper, rewrites something from it.  "Tonight, tomorrow at most, the money should come." <br><br>  Tomorrow at lunch I call again ‚ÄúWhy has the money still not come?‚Äù - ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know, now I‚Äôll call, I‚Äôll find out.‚Äù  I warn you that if I have to come again, I will come with a complaint to the manager.  After 3 hours the money was on the card)) <br><br>  <u>Month 6. Our days.</u> <br>  <i>Branch 5.</i> Operator ‚Äúoh, but how can you send it?  This is not an account number, but a card number ... but although ... yes, you can. "  Fills the data, leaving.  2 days have passed, the translation has not yet arrived. <br><br>  Well, actually ... Initially voiced questions: <br>  - why can't a bank simply train operators how to make a simple money transfer to a card? <br>  - why in different branches different software (from the Tyumen region mother sent a transfer to the same card, using ONLY the card number and name, and the transfer income during the day)? <br>  - why bother to specify dozens of digits, if only a card number is enough for translation? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84598/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84598/</a></p>
