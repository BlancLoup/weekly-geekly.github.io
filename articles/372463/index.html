Consider these components in more detail. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Rocket real time operating system</b> .  At the very center of the scheme is an IoT application written for Rocket.  The OS is based on the Zephyr microkernel.  This is a stable, multi-threaded core, which, on the one hand, takes up little space, and on the other hand, supports many services and is able to interact with a developed ecosystem of services.  Rocket does not depend on hardware architecture, it can work on many platforms, for example, on Intel Galileo Gen 2 motherboard. Much attention is paid to security in Rocket, it supports a wide range of relevant protocols. <br><br></li><li>  <b>App Cloud Development Environment</b> .  The App Cloud makes life easier for IoT application programmers.  Using this cloud environment, you can create smart device firmware using a web browser.  The App Cloud provides the capabilities of an advanced IDE, but at the same time, thanks to the cloud architecture, you can use it wherever you have access to the Internet. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Environment for testing Lab Cloud applications</b> .  The App Cloud development environment is integrated with Lab Cloud, a virtualized hardware environment that can be used to test IoT applications.  After the application is compiled and linked to Rocket in the App Cloud, it can be downloaded to the virtual target device in the Lab Cloud and run.  In this case, the results of the application can be viewed in the App Cloud.  All debugging features that can be expected from the application testing environment are available here.  In particular, this is setting breakpoints and step-by-step code execution.  In this case, special attention in the Lab Cloud is paid to the high performance of the debugging environment and the possibilities of team development. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Secure deployment environment for Device Cloud applications</b> .  When the project reaches the deployment stage, you can use the Device Cloud system to automate this process.  This is a cloud platform that allows you to install applications on multiple devices.  At the same time, a secure connection of these devices with the corporate network is maintained.  Device Cloud allows you to monitor remote IoT devices with Rocket installed, and, at the same time, protects data collected from these devices for centralized analysis.  Device Cloud also helps solve the problem of remote application update.  Even in cases when thousands of devices need updating. <br></li></ul><br>  The figure below shows how the test application developed in App Cloud runs on a virtual device in Lab Cloud.  In this case, it is the QEMU emulator Intel Quark x86.  The black window in the center is the source editor.  Thanks to the tabs system, the editor allows you to work with several files, arranging windows with code in the way that is convenient for the developer.  In the upper right corner of the window you can see the inscription "TestDevice".  In our case, it refers to a virtual device ‚Äúbuilt‚Äù on the x86 platform.  A green dot indicates that the device is connected and ready to go.  The list of files with code included in the project is on the left, the debugger panel is on the right.  And finally, below the window with the code editor is the output area.  Here you can find information about the assembly of the application that runs on the virtual device, as well as view messages that the program displays. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/904/4d8/6f0/9044d86f0ab980cd58ec46856cf06cf6.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Wind River Helix App Cloud - IDE, to work with which you only need a web browser</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Rocket strengths</font> </h2><br>  Let's talk about the merits of developing, testing and deploying applications for Rocket using Helix Cloud Apps. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">- Rocket: Real-Time OS</font> </h3><br>  In Rocket RTOS, everything is aimed at supporting IoT applications.  Here you can find displacing, priority-based tasks and non-preemptive fibers (lightweight threads for performing performance-demanding actions).  The OS also supports a rich set of communication services, such as message queues and byte streams.  The organization of the tasks and fibers in the application is done by the synchronization service.  In addition, RTOS supports power saving mode, in which the central processor is not polled by an internal timer.  This allows you to reduce the energy consumption of IoT-devices, and therefore, for those of them that are in hard-to-reach places and work from their own energy source, increase the lifetime from one set of batteries. <br><br>  Rocket is amenable to deep configuration, in the minimum version it takes only 4 KB of memory.  The OS provides developers with a stable environment for hardware IoT solutions, such as wearable devices, industrial controllers, and devices with limited computing resources. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">- Wind River Helix App Cloud: development</font> </h3><br>  App Cloud simplifies the creation of applications, it provides the developer with a pre-configured IDE and tools designed for the right hardware.  Instead of first installing the development tools, then setting up, achieving the normal collaboration of various subsystems, thanks to App Cloud, you can, without any extra effort, get everything you need to get started right away.  These include, for example, boot images, SDK, OS Rocket, application compilation tools, debuggers for various architectures (the desired debugger is selected automatically, based on the target device used).  App Cloud can be deployed according to the needs of the developer.  So, the base for it can serve as a public server (for example, like Amazon Web Services), it can be a company's own server or a virtual private cloud.  For any of these options, App Cloud provides excellent opportunities to collaborate on projects, this environment is suitable for development teams of different sizes. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">- Wind River Helix Lab Cloud: testing</font> </h3><br>  The Lab Cloud environment is tightly integrated with the App Cloud.  This allows you to run and test IoT applications on virtual devices.  Work with Lab Cloud is conducted through a web browser, it supports many hardware platforms.  As a result, using this tool you can quickly and conveniently test Rocket IoT applications designed for different devices.  In addition, the Lab Cloud environment is designed for joint development, and thanks to the savings from using virtual devices instead of their hardware implementations, this application testing environment is equally effective in teams of various sizes.  When everything is ready, the same images that were tested in Lab Cloud can be flashed to physical devices without the need for any additional configuration. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">- Wind River Helix Device Cloud: Deployment</font> </h3><br>  Thanks to Device Cloud, the physical devices on which you plan to deploy applications can be easily and safely connected to a single control panel.  As a cloud platform, Device Cloud is an integrated set of services that covers a wide range of IoT devices, in particular, these include Intel gateways for the Internet of things.  At the same time for any work with the Device Cloud does not require additional software.  Everything you need is available through the browser. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Results</font> </h2><br>  Intel and Wind River (Intel owns this company) provide an environment that fully covers the life cycle of IoT applications.  App Cloud allows for collaborative development of projects thanks to a browser-based IDE, which requires only an internet connection.  The Lab Cloud environment simplifies testing tasks using various virtual devices, it scales easily, allows you to run and debug applications in a cloud environment.  When the project is ready for release, Device Cloud helps to automate the installation of applications on hundreds and even thousands of devices.  At the same time, the system provides secure access to devices and secure data transfer.  Including - supported remote update firmware devices.  At the center of this whole ecosystem is the hardware-independent, real-time OS Rocket.  On the one hand, it simplifies development, and on the other, it is fully integrated into the best-in-class set of cloud services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372463/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372463/</a></p>
