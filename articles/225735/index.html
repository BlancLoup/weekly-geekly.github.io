And we will not restrain ourselves in this! <br><br>  This article will be more interesting to developers, as well as to all those who are not indifferent to the beauty that is happening on the other side of the games. <br><br>  We have a lot of news: we have seriously grown over this period and have crossed the mark of 80 people, captured almost the entire floor in the BC and traditionally gave our artists the opportunity to decorate the new space with their inherent taste:

Well and, of course, we still have a lot to surprise those who like to cut the ropes and the monster of Am Nyam. <br><br>  Over the past year, we have significantly refined and run-in the internal framework, which allows us to write all the C ++ game code and build builds for iOS and Android right away.  Also over the past year, we began to actively use the features of C ++ 11, and, despite the obvious amount of legacy code in the framework itself, the use of the features of C ++ 11 in the design code of new titles becomes our standard.  In parallel, we are considering other development tools, such as Unity.  However, in our framework there are a number of advantages that we simply don‚Äôt want to give up. <a name="habracut"></a>  First of all, this is the system for creating animations, about which there was already an article on Habr√©.  This system for the past time has been seriously refined. <br><br>  It is no secret that the heights of programming (and not only) are reached by those who work a lot, including on themselves and their education.  In ZeptoLab, we try to create the space that is most suitable for this.  In particular, we recently had a corporate library, where you can find everything you need to get new knowledge, as well as an improvised reading room with sofas and armchairs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4a/a7e/a94/d4aa7ea949230cd5c39109b0d3078aeb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, in general: over the past year we have systematically approached the issue of employee education.  So last year, we had an internal C ++ competition, the winners of which received the coolest exclusive T-shirts, which our artists and designers made for us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70c/b3f/950/70cb3f9503522fa50297e2c7ed69ade6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since the end of May, Zeptolab has opened its own closed school, in which Codeforces creator and head Mikhail Mirzayanov teaches algorithms, a well-known personality in development circles: Misha has already trained a team that has become the world champion in programming, so you can imagine what horizons were to the developers of ZeptoLab and to the company as a whole.  In this format, Misha teaches for the first time;  in Russia and the world - units of analogues of a similar system of corporate education. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f76/1f4/d93/f761f4d932a19bcd5e0965042f6b1e7d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And since the experience of the competition was positive, we decided, together with Codeforces, to hold an open programming championship. <br><br>  And finally, your attention is the championship for the development of ZeptoLab Code Rush 2014. <br><br>  Nontrivial tasks, uncompromising developer struggle and cool prizes await the participants: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ac/f0d/afa/2acf0dafa9eb2070057b25e95ff36113.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For those interested - T-shirts will be like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/510/76e/9f1/51076e9f1ef973a7cd71d86151cde529.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, to add intrigue - there will be another prize: we will randomly hand over the iPad Mini Retina to those in the TOP-50 contest winners and will be chosen like this: we will sum up the times of all successful attempts of the three winners (in seconds from the start of the contest) and take line with number s% 47 + 4, where s is the sum found.  If the computed line will divide the space, then the one who passed the last of the solved tasks earlier will have priority. <br><br>  And for the sweet: the one who will show good results in the competition, will have the opportunity to get us in a simplified scheme.  On <a href="http://www.zeptoteam.ru/">zeptoteam.ru</a> about what it is like to be a part of ZeptoTeam.  On contact with the proposal we leave ourselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e37/ede/b06/e37edeb061a7922868f86eb6eed20696.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Championship will be held in one round.  The format of the competition - <a href="http://codeforces.ru/blog/entry/4088">according to the rules of Codeforces</a> . <br>  The round will be rated in the Codeforces system and common for both divisions.  Participants who have not previously participated in Codeforces championships are advised to register in advance on the site (this can be done through open OpenID, Gmail or VKontakte accounts) and deal with the system: you can take a virtual part in one of the past competitions. <br><br>  <b>Date and time of the event: June 13, 2014, time: 19-30 - 22-00.</b> <br><br>  In order to participate in ZeptoLab Code Rush, you need to <a href="http://codeforces.ru/contests/436">register</a> <br>  Registration will open on June 10 from 12-00 and will last until June 13, 19-25. <br><br>  Questions about the championship in the comments on the site Codeforces.ru. <br>  Write code with us.  Write us.  Write better than us!  Well, in general - write! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52d/a3b/d13/52da3bd13c12bae183380f321cceec60.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Your ZeptoTeam. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225735/</a></p>
