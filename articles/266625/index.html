  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cisco internship program - Cisco International Internship Program. How it was</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I want to talk about my annual internship at Cisco Systems in the USA, which I got in 2013 after 4 years of training at Moscow State Technical University.  Bauman.  I will touch upon the questions I was looking for answers to before applying, I will share the results of the trip, and in the end I will tell you about what needs to be done to get on this internship.  For me, the year spent in America was a great adventure and, of course, a unique opportunity to work among talented people from all over the world.  This year's enrollment for the internship program ends in a week and, perhaps, my article will become for someone additional motivation to apply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ca/cc2/a2b/7cacc2a2b8c249869327d9480580086d.jpg" title="All Program Members at Cisco Headquarters"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll start with a brief story about myself.  My name is Yevgeny Baghdasaryan, I am still a student at the Moscow State Technical University.  Bauman specialty "Automated control systems and information processing."  Now I am on the 6th year to get a specialist degree (yes, there is still such a degree, and yes, it‚Äôs necessary to plow for 6 years).  Experience before the internship was 6 months of work in the system integrator and 6 months of internship in an auditing company of the big four.  I am also a three-time scholar of the V. Potanin Foundation, which I am particularly proud of.  After the internship, I got a job at the Moscow office of Cisco and already work as an engineer. <br><br>  So, a list of questions that I wanted to know the answers before you go.  Despite their commonplaceness and evidence, I think it is very important that you ask them about yourself.

    <ul><li>  <b>What can you learn?</b> <br>  Anything.  Thanks to the corporate culture, you can communicate with absolutely all employees, regardless of their position, and since the interests of Cisco affect virtually all areas of IT, you can always find yourself an interlocutor and mentor in an interesting area.  For example, I worked in Boston, and in the evenings I went to lectures at MIT and Harvard.  That is, the possibilities are limited by your desires. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ea/219/d86/5ea219d869474a978ded7b33d6284e8b.jpg"><br><br></li><li>  <b>How will this help me in building a future career?</b> <br>  Here is not so simple.  International experience is an excellent line in the resume.  But in general, in terms of knowledge, work in Russia will not be very different.  I would say that the most valuable thing I learned is the life experience that daily tasks help me solve now, and thanks to him, I can work more efficiently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/535/0c0/345/5350c034559b4fdb9ce0d0ff6e98ae93.jpg"><br><br></li><li>  <b>How to organize all this?</b> <br>  A trip for a year while studying is almost exactly a sabbatical, but some guys agreed to study remotely with the dean.  Documents when passing through the final selection stage and getting an offer are prepared by experienced people for free, so there is no need to worry here either.  The main thing is to tune in and submit an application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14a/7b5/caf/14a7b5caf20d437586dff1002424febf.jpg"><br></li></ul><br>  Now to where many of us ended up after the internship.  I would add that in general the level of students from around the world is very high, advanced technical universities and smart and talented guys, but there were restrictions on citizenship and the list of universities.  You are more fortunate - now there are no such restrictions - a decision has been made to allow all universities from all countries to be selected. <br>  So, who got to where.  More than half of the interns, and there were already about 150 people in four years, remain at Cisco in various parts of the world.  Someone remains in the United States, and someone, like me, returns to finish their studies and works in local offices.  Fortunately, Cisco is a pioneer and leader of the telecommunications market (read about video conferencing technology - TelePresence, for example) - and this means that there are absolutely no boundaries or distances in such an environment.  Many guys went to work in startups or large companies;  someone connected their lives with science.  A year after graduation, I want to say that almost no one has any problems with building a career.  And yet, do not forget that communication or networking is always in price, and a year in America will help you to get them to the full. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/519/0f6/96d/5190f696dd2743d68f35a4e0ccd5d22b.jpg"><br><br>  Let's talk a little about the program itself and about the features of training.  I'll start with deadlines.  <b>Applications are accepted yes October 20th.</b>  The site of the program is <a href="http://myciip.com/">myciip.com</a> .  It is important to be a senior student, know English and have technical skills. <br><br>  Requirements for English are not very high, the submitter must be able to understand the question and give a reasonable answer.  High knowledge of English is an absolute plus, but resumes and motivations are much more important.  Interviews will be held only in 3-4 months.  This period is enough to remember forgotten words and phrases.  I think the most important thing in the program is the letter of motivation.  It needs to tell why and why you are interested in Cisco.  The more creativity and originality, the better.  It is important to know the goals of the company, and your technical or business experience must meet these goals.  I want to reassure that almost any experience in IT or related areas will be relevant.  Competition of about 30-50 people per place, so with a well-prepared resume and a motivational letter, the chance to spend a whole year in the sunny Silicon Valley is not that small. <br><br>  I became the owner of the most valuable life experience working in a team of professionals.  There were a lot of questions in front of me that were important to find answers before the trip, and after finishing finding my place. <br><br>  If you have any questions after reading the article - ask them in the comments.  I will answer with pleasure. <br>  Good luck to you! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c6/21b/ac5/3c621bac5ebb474d87f63d02422932f0.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266625/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266625/</a></p>
