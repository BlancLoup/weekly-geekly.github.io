  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Steve Wozniak: Actually, the film was basically a lie about me.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Actually, the movie was basically a lie about me.  I was an engineer at HP developing the iPhone 5 of that time, their engineering calculators.  There I had a lot of friends and a good reputation.  I created things for people all over the country for entertainment, including the first movie rental system for hotels and SMPTE timecode readers for the commercial video world.  More homemade pinball games. <br><br>  Among these things, Apple I was the FIFTH case, when something that I created (and not collected on the basis of someone else's scheme) was turned into money by Jobs. <a name="habracut"></a>  My game Pong gave him his job at Atari, but he was never an engineer or programmer.  I have been a regular member of the Homemade Computers Club since its inception, and Jobs did not know about its existence.  I took my schemes to the Club meetings and showed there, having great success.  I was not unsociable, although I was shy in relationships with others. <br><br>  I shared my schemes for free to help people who supported the idea that computers change lives in many ways (communication, education, productivity, etc.).  I was inspired by Stanford intellectuals, such as Jim Warren, talking about this at club meetings.

      Lee Felsenstein wanted computers to help organize antiwar marches that he organized in Auckland and I was inspired by the fact that these machines can help stop wars.  Other members of the Club had working models of this computer even before Jobs found out about it.  One day he came, and I took him to a Club meeting, not the other way around.  He saw the Club from the point of view of a businessman.  In addition, I told Jobs about the benefits that computers can bring to all mankind, and not to me.  I begged Steve to donate the first Apple I to a woman who introduced computers in schools, but he made it so that I had to buy it myself and donate it. <br><br>  When I first met Jobs, I already had ALL Bob Dylan albums, I was his big fan.  In addition, I had a bootleg.  Jobs knew several popular Dylan songs and what was related to the phrase ‚Äúwhen you have nothing, you have nothing to lose‚Äù.  I showed Jobs the lyrics and all the notes from the albums and then took him with me to the record stores near San Jose and Berkeley to buy a bootleg Dylan.  I showed him Dylan's brochures with quotes, articles and photos.  In general, I can say that I opened the world of Dylan to Jobs.  I traveled to Auckland to buy Dylan's concert tickets at midnight and take Jobs with me.  Somehow, at the beginning of our friendship, he asked: who is better - Dylan or the Beatles?  I didn't have a Beatles album.  We concluded that Dylan was more important because  he talked about important things and expressed significant thoughts.  So the Beatles fans were like stupid sheep for us.  Why did they portray us in the film, as if Jobs was listening to Dylan, and I was the Beatles? <br><br>  And when Jobs (in the film, but in reality the advice did) refused to share in the actions of the ‚Äúgarage team‚Äù (some were not even shown), I was surprised that they decided not to show how I gave a share worth about $ 10 million from my parts of the stock, because I thought it was right.  And 10 million dollars then was a lot of money. <br><br>  Also, notice the time period shown in the film when every computer Jobs developed was a flop.  And in each of these failures millions of dollars were invested.  My Apple] [was developed without any investment from the outside and built on a minimum of components.  Despite this, he was the only source of profit for the company during the first 10 years of its existence, even after Jobs left it. <br><br>  The film makes one think that the board members did not appreciate Jobs' excellent work on Macintosh, but when sales fell to several hundred pieces a month and the stock price dropped 50% in a short time, someone had to save the company.  The right course was to work out every possible direction, engineering and marketing, to make the Mac sell, while Apple] [supported us all this time.  This work was carried out by Scully and others, in addition, it also led to the discovery of Macintosh. <br><br>  The film shows that Steve was a motivator for the entire Macintosh team, but does not show that most of the team said that they would never work with him again.  The film does not show his contempt and attempts to destroy Apple] [, the source of our income, so that it does not compete with McIntosh.  The audience of the film would like to see a complete picture of events, and she may well say that in many places she was deceived. <br><br>  In addition, the simplicity of interacting with a computer came to the world most of the ideas of Jeff Raskin, in many things, and long before Jeff told us to look at the development of Xerox.  Jeff's character was severely distorted. <br><br>  And if you think that such our investor (as well as the shareholder and mentor), like Mike Markkula was Jobs' puppet, then, alas, you were deceived. <br><br>  Mannerism and Jobs phrases are motivational and you need a push to move forward.  But skill and craftsmanship are also important for this, in order to create products that are popular enough to be sold more expensive than the cost of creating them.  Jobs did not succeed in creating such products before the iPod (although OS X deserves mention in this context). <br><br>  Viewers would like to see such details in the film, and about Jobs and about Apple, but in the film it‚Äôs all shown completely differently. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209768/</a></p>
