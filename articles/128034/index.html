There are two types of goals. </h4><br>  The first is those that must be achieved.  It is necessary to earn money in order not to die of hunger, it is necessary to develop, to be in demand and so on.  It is obvious and few people have questions, such goals can not be achieved. <br><br>  The second is what you want.  This is the motivation.

      If you are interested in how to get the maximum result in the shortest possible time, specific tips for gaining motivation and experience, both personally and famous people, welcome <a name="habracut"></a>  under the cut <br><br><h4>  Why don't people fly like birds? </h4><br>  Because there are no wings.  Why do most people quit after the start or do not start doing useful things for themselves?  Because there is no motivation.  There is no desire for long-term activities.  A year ago, I ran into a terrible, as it seemed to me then, problem - I didn‚Äôt have enough time and desire for absolutely anything.  I started reading a book and threw it in two days, started jogging in the morning and suddenly found myself loaded with urgent matters, I started my studies and work so much that I ended the session at best with half marks ‚Äúgood‚Äù and missed all the possible work as a copywriter. deadlines and eventually lost it. <br><br><br>  It was then that one intelligent person strongly recommended me to read the book by Daniil Granin ‚Äú <a href="http://flibusta.net/b/239869/read">This strange life</a> ‚Äù, a kind of biography of the famous Soviet scientist <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D1%258E%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Alexander Alexandrovich Lyubishchev</a> .  At first it was wildly boring, but gradually I got carried away.  So much so that the book ultimately turned my whole life, put it on my head from where it should go - on my feet. <br><br><br>  What is her secret?  This is not another guide ‚ÄúHow to become effective and not be afraid of your goals in 15 days‚Äù, not a collection of rules, not even a book with magic spells stolen from Hogwarts.  The most interesting thing is that there is no secret, it is just an unusual biography of an unusual person.  It ‚Äúsimply‚Äù tells that Lyubishchev, at the age of 18, understood the undoubted importance and necessity of planning and what he did from that moment to the end of his life. <br><br><br><h4>  Draw a map on the map. </h4><br>  Remember the lines from the wonderful radio play of the USSR times ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland‚Äù: <br><br><br>  <i>"To avoid being trapped,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>To not get lost in the dark</i> <i><br></i>  <i>To land in the right place, splash down -</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Draw a map on the map. ‚Äù?</i> <br><br><br>  Despite the humor and humor, the advice is incredibly good and useful.  Only comprehensive planning and quite a bit of luck help us not to fall into the traps and get out of the pits into which we sometimes drive ourselves. <br><br><br>  At one time, the article ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gtd/38434/">Rules for personal effectiveness from ED</a> ‚Äù, an excellent motivating article, caught my eye.  Instantly the desire to do something lights up and to do it is 100,500% better than before.  Only I have this desire as a fire, and went out.  After I learned about good planning (this is not hyperbole, the ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù methods used by most people often take a lot of time and effort, the Lyubishchev system was perfected by him for himself for many years of his life) and analyzed the situation it became clear what I lacked initially. <br><br>  Specifically, that article helped clarify the head and see, even if not immediately, what I want and should do, it helped a lot in setting goals.  This was not enough, but I have already taken the first step.  Half a year passed before I read Granin‚Äôs book and began to step on carefully.  The next step was to break down the goals into concrete actions.  The goal was to ‚ÄúLearn to swim,‚Äù until the age of 20 I couldn‚Äôt swim down.  But he was able to learn, thanks to the implementation of actions - ‚Äúto find the nearest pool‚Äù, ‚Äúto find out the mode of operation and the price per lesson‚Äù, ‚Äúto find an intelligent trainer‚Äù and ‚Äúto start classes from the second of July‚Äù.  This goal was achieved, everything went perfectly. <br><br><br>  From the beginning of the use of the planning system, I have also been failing, only the lesson of the article on high efficiency has already been learned.  Each failure was thoroughly analyzed - ‚Äúhow?  What?  Where?  Why?  Who is guilty?  What to do? ‚Äù, There were always reasons for the failures.  And the subsequent planning with their account helped to achieve the goals in full. <br><br><br>  There is one small, but weighty ‚ÄúBUT‚Äù - to achieve a sustainable result, it is necessary to live in a frenzy (as people see it from the outside) the cycle of ‚Äúthe goal - the planning - the implementation - the analysis - the new goal‚Äù for some time.  From the first time I did not succeed, I tried again a month later, time after time the uncertain step turned into quite confident running through life.  I remembered that there is no such wonderful pill, magic word, ‚Äúunique working in one week‚Äù method.  I tried and made mistakes, until finally I came to the point that I am now - there are no problems with studies, an interesting job was found by a translator, regular physical education makes itself felt very good health, constant reading of books increases erudition and broadens the mind. <br><br><br>  And that helped me a lot, served as a support and gave confidence in the result - that was experience.  The experience of other people who set incredible goals and achieve them.  This is not only the already mentioned Lyubishchev (although he gave the main impetus), but also the famous politician Benjamin Franklin with his <a href="http://flibusta.net/b/198841/read">famous autobiography</a> , and the main character of the story ‚ÄúThe <a href="http://flibusta.net/b/80502/read">Bricks</a> ‚Äù by Daniyar Surgalinov, and King George VI, who is familiar to many in the film ‚ÄúThe King Says‚Äù, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Deuh-9WBXDO4">wrestler Dustin Carter</a> , left without limbs, and just the people around him. <br><br><br>  Yes, look around and look at everyone more closely - each of us is surrounded by many people who are seeking their own.  Why not try it yourself? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128034/</a></p>
