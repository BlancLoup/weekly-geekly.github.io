  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Goodsoft.eu - independent :) technical support service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the past couple of years, people have often asked me to help them with their computer-related problems.  Well there, install the driver, configure Windows or ‚Äúclean the computer, so as not to slow down.‚Äù  There were more and more appeals, but less time, and there was a need to somehow systematize the appeals.  So the thought was born of creating a small web service to help the suffering computer users.  Then other IT specialists will be able to connect to the consultation process, because one head is good, but many are better. <br><br> <a href="http://www.goodsoft.eu/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fc/86c/f52/7fc86cf52787fde8ee435ff42fc52f56.png"></a> <br><br>  And here it is a miracle here :) Meet <a href="http://www.goodsoft.eu/">Goodsoft.eu</a> - the center of free, professional technical support for computer users.

      For minus comrades, I don‚Äôt want to shove an article into Startups blog, because it‚Äôs still a long way from a startup, but I‚Äôd like to hear an objective assessment :) Thank you. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I cannot boast with great knowledge in PHP, but it was enough to write this simple site, to fasten an SMS-payment system (absolutely voluntary) and a few small lotions to it.  The whole previous month the site was in the ‚Äúclosed beta test‚Äù mode (oh, how beautifully it says!), In which my friends and acquaintances participated.  And now the website is in test mode, open to all comers. <br><br>  For me, this site is a sample of a pen with ink from a can labeled ‚ÄúPHP‚Äù.  For a long time, I thought, ‚ÄúWhat would create such a thing?‚Äù.  And here it is - under the nose :) The problem faced by many people, has caused the site to appear.  I don‚Äôt think that now all users will tumble down on my site to ask questions (after all, there are Answers. Google and Questions. Mail.ru), but he will definitely find his clientele.  As well as there will be those who on a voluntary basis will advise users. <br><br>  What is the feature of the site?  From a social point of view, Goodsoft.eu is a one-time site.  The client will contact us only if he has any problem with the computer.  The second time the client will contact us only if his first problem is solved quickly and professionally.  That is why there is no registration on the site (in general, it is, but well disguised) and advertising (available only in two places - social, so far). <br><br>  What is the vision?  I think the immediate plans are to improve the payment system so that you can make a donation in favor of a specific consultant or even for a specific consultation.  It was also thought to make a boxed version of the system.  support, to attract those who want to develop it, and put it in free access.  But as they say, the necessary condition has not yet been received, and so far it is very distant plans. <br><br>  From habrasoobshchestva would like to receive criticism and suggestions both on the part of the site itself (design, etc.), and on issues related to its future. <br><br>  Be happy! <br><br>  <b>[upd:]</b> I see that there are many who want to see ‚ÄúWhat's inside‚Äù ‚Üí and as a result - a lot of strange and strange questions.  You can see what and how ‚Äúinside‚Äù can be done by entering the email address <i>test@test.gg</i> on the main page. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125176/</a></p>
