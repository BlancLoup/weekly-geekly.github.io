  <section class="page js-page"><h1>8 Parameters of the social life of the team: how to measure the immeasurable</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About half a year ago, the book Charlie Pelerin came into my hands. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-NASA-Builds-Teams-Scientists/dp/0470456485">How NASA builds teams</a> .  The book described the social problems of large technology projects that cost millions of dollars in the US space industry. <br><br>  In Charlie's book, I underlined a number of ideas about measuring the social context of a project.  And made some observations with agile development teams.  I think the best <a href="http://www.4-dsystems.com/">NASA 4-D system is</a> best used for thematic team <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">retrospectives</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/03a/99c/c09/03a99cc09227222b55ebb4e02d6ba54a.jpg" align="left">  However, regardless of the process used and the maturity of the team, the 8 social parameters described below are quite interesting to discuss.  Talking about them can give a number of ideas about strengthening teamwork and social success factors of the project.

      For each of the points I described the basic value of the ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù.  Reading the description of social parameters, try to ask the question: ‚ÄúHow well does this aspect of the social life of our team function?‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Expression of thanks and recognition.</b>  People like to feel recognition of achievements and gratitude for the work of others.  Through an expression of sincere recognition, an atmosphere of mutual respect is created. <br><br>  <u>Maximum:</u> Recognition and gratitude are expressed regularly, sincerely, in a timely manner, specifically and proportionally to the contribution of participants. <br><br>  <b>2. Knowledge and use of common interests.</b>  People prefer interaction to personal interests when they understand the common goals and benefits of working together.  Interests are an expression of values ‚Äã‚Äãand attitudes.  You can define common interests by asking the question: "What do they want, what do I want for them too?" <br><br>  <u>Maximum:</u> Team members know and use common interests, especially in resolving disputes and conflicts. <br><br>  <b>3. Proper inclusion in processes.</b>  It is important for people to feel ownership as well as recognition.  We feel the ‚Äúinclusion‚Äù through the exchange of information, delegation, expression and consideration of opinions.  A typical example of insufficient inclusion is the adoption of an important decision for all by an incomplete team.  An example of excessive inclusion is boredom at meetings and abuse of the CC options and ‚ÄúReply to all‚Äù in the mail. <br><br>  <u>Maximum:</u> Team members exchange information, make decisions, participate in implementation, avoiding inadequate or wasteful engagement. <br><br>  <b>4. Compliance with all agreements.</b>  People like to work in an atmosphere of trust, and trust develops through the observance of agreements.  In addition, the rules are adopted and implemented in order to improve work efficiency.  If it is difficult to adhere to the agreements, before abandoning or violating them, be sure to discuss the reasons and ways for their adjustment. <br><br>  <u>Maximum:</u> The team accepts only those rules that all participants agreed to abide by.  Team members strictly follow the arrangements. <br><br>  <b>5. Expression of realistic optimism.</b>  It is important for people to believe in a positive future.  Optimism is enhanced by understanding the final benefits and correlating temporary difficulties with them.  It is important to discuss issues openly and in a timely manner, in an atmosphere of support and sound optimism. <br><br>  <u>Maximum:</u> All participants understand the goals and believe in their achievement.  The team is optimistic, even when faced with difficulties. <br><br>  <b>6. Commitment to the ultimate goal.</b>  Focusing on the final goal increases the energy and involvement of the team.  People who are focused on the result experience a change in perception and begin to see additional opportunities (Perhaps there is a similar saying in Russian: ‚ÄúWhere attention goes, power flows‚Äù). <br><br>  <u>Maximum:</u> Team members demonstrate 100% commitment and common goals. <br><br>  <b>7. Rebuke to prosecutors and complainants.</b>  States of drama take too much energy.  Focus on solving problems instead of finding the culprits or circumstances.  Do not join the ‚Äúclub‚Äù of victims and aggressors and the team‚Äôs culture will become healthier. <br><br>  <u>Maximum:</u> It is not customary in the team to blame others or complain about circumstances.  Team members avoid these ways of avoiding responsibility and help others with it. <br><br>  <b>8. Clarity of functions, accountability and authority.</b>  Success is determined by meeting expectations or being able to exceed them.  Clarifying the roles, functions, accountability, expected results and the power needed to achieve them helps the team to work successfully. <br><br>  <u>Maximum: The</u> expectations for team member roles are clear.  Responsibility areas are allocated and provided with appropriate powers.  Expectations agreed with all important parties. <br><br><h5>  How to measure the social context? </h5><br>  How to determine the "maximum" of your team and how far you are from it?  To measure immeasurable things in our work we use a variety of scales and maps.  When it is impossible to accurately calibrate the rating system, you can measure your ‚Äúsatisfaction‚Äù or ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù.  By giving, for example, ‚Äú3‚Äù on a 5-point scale, you can explain to your colleagues what this assessment means to you, why you chose it.  Indeed, the purpose of such a conversation is not to obtain an accurate assessment, but to generate ideas for improving the process and teamwork.  The figure above shows an example of organizing a map with 8 scales to discuss the social context of a project. <br><br>  At the next <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/scrumguides/events/1503/">AgileBaseCamp: VALUE Driven Development</a> conference in Kiev, I will hold a small master class on team interaction amplifiers.  However, any constructive talk about these parameters may be useful.  If you are interested in this tool, but there is no opportunity to attend a master class, I‚Äôm happy to share ideas about using the scales and the NASA 4D system in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/natatara/">person</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161639/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161639/</a></p>
