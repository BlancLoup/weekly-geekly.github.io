It is convenient to use it and often you cannot afford to buy it, because the toad is strangling or you think ‚ÄúI will manage without it‚Äù.  It is very nice to receive such a gift from your wishlist.  This spurs you internally to further work, gives an additional incentive to get for yourself some more useful or just a pleasant thing, which you will use with pleasure. <br>  <strong>TRASH</strong> <br>  And if such useful pieces accumulate a great many?  The question is not correct - there are really not many usable things and it all depends on your ambitions and the size of your place of residence. <br>  On this account it is very useful to read the <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.rsdn.ru/Forum/message/2758086.flat.aspx">article by</a> Paul Graham "Stuff" and discussions in the section Lifehack on Habr√©. <br>  To clutter up your life and drag a pair of suitcases stuffed with a bunch of clothes, napkins, electric razors, electronic lotions on each trip - this is a great evil.  From the 2nd year of uni course I never take with me something that does not fit in my backpack - and that‚Äôs enough for me.  I feel dry and comfortable, because at least I took with me a toothbrush and a phone with which I can stay connected to virtually all protocols, read, listen to music, take funny moments. <br>  Unnecessary gifts clutter up the space around us, it‚Äôs a pity to throw them out, they sometimes cost a lot of money but in fact were intended only for sale as a gift.  I call it the hump.  The hump is abnormal, it is superfluous, it does not paint a person.  But in the case of things this pile of belongings can be raked. <br>  I'll tell you how I do it. <br><ol><li>  Get rid of excess food, leftovers in the fridge, which many people like to lay out in pialushechkam bowls and put in the refrigerator.  Anyway, this is unlikely to be eaten and thrown out only at the moment when the refrigerator starts to smell sweet). </li><li>  Clothing - if it looks unfashionable, shabby, sits not so well anymore ... in general - you can't go outside in it - it is worn at home.  I don‚Äôt buy clothes for the house on purpose ‚Äî she will be thrown out at the first moment.  Of course, I do not go in an old suit around the house (I stupidly do not have it).  I'm just a black hole for t-shirts and jeans.  How many do not buy - everything is small) This problem is simply solved by ruthless throwing out or using as rags.  And I do not buy cheap clothes - its quality annoys me.  Appearance - before the first wash.  From my parents it looks like I'm a dude - no, I invest in my own comfort and time.  The time of many hours of trips to the market is over.  Save time shopping. </li><li>  I do not store unnecessary information to me on the screw.  My disks just do not allow me such luxury (look at the <a href="http://blog.dmarkin.name/other/zhelezki-kotoryie-ya-ispolzuyu/">pieces of iron I use</a> ).  I do not need to rummage on the screw in search of the necessary document - I just know where it lies and never use Spotlight search.  I am an economist of information and resources.  At the moment, all I need for work is a browser and any text editor.  Organize the acquisition, filtering and assimilation of the desired material using Google Reader.  Tag, tag interesting, break into topics, regularly clean out subscriptions - not all of them are in fact useful and regularly updated.  And do not keep on hand a bunch of widgets, checkers, plug-ins and the like husks, which eats resources (and, accordingly, reduces the speed of your work). </li></ol><br>  <em>End up owning you.</em> <br>  <em>Shit we do not need.</em> <br>  <em>- Fight Club</em> <br>  Often it is so difficult to give up what seems useful - and you seem to even love and use it ... But deign to throw it out - and you will feel better)) <br>  I am waiting for comments about your ways of ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù your life. <br>  <a href="http://blog.dmarkin.name/we/poleznyie-podarki-hlam/">Crosspost in my new blog</a> </div>
