Satellites are all over the horizon, and in any case, legally that content is not for sale in Europe.  Why then I did not know about Netflix and similar services, although this is not really television.  American TV interested me primarily for the development of English, the second because there is all the most interesting, all the TV shows that I watched, so to speak, pleasant with useful.  Nobody canceled the torrents of course, but it is necessary to do something, search, download, know what to look for.  It is much more difficult than pressing one button and, having sent the telly to the background of brain activity, continue to do household chores.  Several years have passed, I now have television in English, but unfortunately it‚Äôs still there - or rather, as delicious content was limited to one country, it remains so.  New Zealand is agitating to use a proxy to bypass the geo-defense, not far behind her Australia, which also does not quite like to be off topic.  I don‚Äôt know how things are with this in the old Europe, although there‚Äôs still English no one‚Äôs native and with better content. <br>  In part, it is clear where such stupid restrictions come from at first glance - local content distribution not only makes life easier for large content-producing companies, but also creates local jobs due to which there are small but proud companies like the recently mentioned Cinema without Borders.  Let 10 people, but in business.  But all the rest of course from this neither hot nor cold.  In general, the dilemma is not quite the level of AvtoVAZ, but about the same series. <br>  Well, enough to whine, it's not about that.  To whom it is necessary for those who have long found everything and are looking, who do not - maybe it will be interesting to play. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Actually, all this somehow in my subconscious mind slipped in my head for microseconds when I tried to understand why I needed IPv6 at home.  I work with networks, it was interesting for me to play with him, but it was not clear whether this would make any sense to justify the investment.  I still bought the router myself - Cisco 1841 b \ y for $ 100 on ebay with delivery.  This beast, which is 100 years old at lunch, for some reason is still alive and even supports the 15th IOS, a kind of 2950 only router.  2950 by the way I bought a little later for 30 :)

      It was not a big deal to get IPv6, many times they wrote how to do it.  Hurricane Electric, the tunnel, and your personal / 48 (well, not quite personal, but at your disposal) network at your service.  Plus one more / 64 for a tunnel with two addresses, it‚Äôs necessary to put them somewhere ... The fact that / 48 is not completely personal is rather good, because it will be defined as HE, and therefore as being in America.  What we actually need. <br><br>  Netflix seems to support IPv6 quite well, well, this is generally known, with the exception of the truth of one address which, by luck, most likely non-randomness turned out to be the address of the authorization server. <br><br>  C: \&gt; nslookup signup.netflix.com <br>  Server: ordns.he.net <br>  Address: 2001: 470: 20 :: 2 <br>  Not credible answer: <br>  ecweb--frontend-302252202.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com <br>  Addresses: 184.73.162.201 <br>  23.21.178.236 <br>  23.23.242.206 <br>  Aliases: signup.netflix.com <br><br>  That is, without the usual ip all the same way.  I didn‚Äôt manage to find an open vpn server in the States that could be friends with a router, so I used free vpngate.net and a client on my computer.  The servers there, as I understand it, are supported by enthusiasts, there is no stability, speed too, but we get it and we don‚Äôt need it.  Having created an account (you can specify any ZIP, but it must be present, you also need to specify a credit card, although it will not be necessary for the first month) and having logged in the VPN you can turn it off, everything else continues to work over V6.  If V6 does not work, then Netflix will once again begin to swear that service is not available. <br>  In principle, such a solution is suitable to watch it on a computer, which of course is not a super option, but still.  I do not know how many cookies will live there, but it seems like quite a long time, so it will not be necessary to log in every day. <br><br>  For those who are not an IPv6 enthusiast, in fact, it has long turned out to be slightly paid ($ 5 per month) services like unblock-us.com.  Ingeniously and simply - you change the DNS server and the necessary addresses will go through unknown proxies.  Not very good in terms of security, but for some kind of Apple TV is fine.  The last one I could not get to work on v6, it looks like this wonderful box doesn‚Äôt support it very well.  But we must dig deeper, you never know.  In any case, it will be necessary to somehow bypass the authorization server, you will not run the VPN client on the apple tv ... <br>  For those who are very concerned, there is already heavily paid ustvnow.com, this is already television, and not just VOD, of course, if you are a US citizen temporarily living abroad;) <br><br>  Whether all of this is necessary or not, in general, the question is very personal, but at least there is at least one relatively useful application of IPv6 at the moment, though not completely self-sufficient.  In addition, I have so far noticed only Google and Gmail from constantly used websites that support V6.  But besides periodic problems with atorization, this brings nothing new. <br><br>  Reflections on topics are welcome :) <br><br>  Ps.  not sure about hubs, sort of more or less related to cisco and iptv <br><br>  The simplest configuration tsiski <br><br>  interface Tunnel0 <br>  description Hurricane electric <br>  no ip address <br>  ipv6 address 2001: 470: xxxx: 2/64 <br>  ipv6 enable <br>  ipv6 inspect ipv6 out <br>  ipv6 traffic-filter IPv6 in <br>  tunnel source Dialer1 <br>  tunnel mode ipv6ip <br>  tunnel destination 66.220.18.42 <br>  end <br><br>  IPv6 access list IPv6 <br>  permit icmp any any unreachable sequence 10 <br>  permit icmp any any packet-too-big sequence 20 <br>  permit icmp any any hop-limit sequence 30 <br>  permit icmp any any reassembly-timeout sequence 40 <br>  permit icmp any any header sequence 50 <br>  permit icmp any next-header (4 matches) sequence 60 <br>  permit icmp any parameter parameter option 70 <br>  permit icmp any any echo-request (117 matches) sequence 80 <br>  permit icmp any any echo-reply sequence 90 <br>  permit icmp any any dhaad-request sequence 100 <br>  permit icmp any any dhaad-reply sequence 110 <br>  permit icmp any any mpd-solicitation sequence 120 <br>  permit icmp any any mpd-advertisement sequence 130 <br>  permit icmp any any nd-na sequence 140 <br>  permit icmp any any nd-ns sequence 150 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189310/</a></p>
