    <br>  All happy families are alike, each unhappy family. <br>  unhappy in their own way. <br>  Everything was mixed up in the Oblonskys' house.  The wife found out that her husband was due to <br>  the French governess in their house, and announced to her husband that he could not <br>  live with him in the same house.  The situation lasted for the third day and <br>  it was painfully felt by both the spouses themselves, and all family members, and <br>  households.  All family members and households felt that there was no point in their <br>  cohabitation and that in each inn people randomly come together <br>  connected with each other than they, family members and Oblonsky households.  Wife not <br>  left her room, her husband was not at home for the third day.  The kids ran around <br>  the whole house is lost;  Englishwoman quarreled with the housekeeper and wrote <br>  a note to a friend asking for a new place to come to her;  the cook left yesterday <br>  from the yard during lunch;  the black cook and the coachman asked for a calculation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the third day after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevich Oblonsky - Steve, as <br>  his name was in the light, - at the usual hour, that is, at eight in the morning, he woke up <br>  not in his wife's bedroom, but in his office, on a morocco couch ... He turned <br>  his full, well-groomed body on the springs of the sofa, as if wanting to fall asleep again <br>  for a long time, on the other hand, he firmly hugged the pillow and pressed his cheek against it;  but <br>  suddenly he jumped up, sat down on the sofa and opened his eyes. <br>  ‚ÄúYes, yes, how was it?  - He thought, remembering a dream.  - Yes, how was it? <br>  Yes!  Alabin was giving dinner at Darmstadt;  No, not in Darmstadt, but something <br>  American  Yes, but Darmstadt was there in America.  Yes, Alabin was giving lunch on <br>  glass tables, yes, - and the tables were sung: Il mio tesoro, and not Il mio tesoro, but <br>  something is better, and some small decanters, and they are women, ‚Äùhe recalled. <br>  The eyes of Stepan Arkadyevich gleamed merrily, and he thought, smiling. <br>  ‚ÄúYes, it was good, very good.  A lot more there was great, but can not you say <br>  words and thoughts even in reality can not express. "  And, noticing a line of light, <br>  breaking out from the side of one of the wooded stor, he cheerfully kicked off his legs from the sofa <br>  found them sewn by his wife (a birthday present last year), put on <br>  in golden morocco shoes and the old, nine-year habit, without rising, <br>  I reached out to where the robe hung in his bedroom.  And here he is <br>  suddenly remembered how and why he sleeps not in his wife‚Äôs bedroom, but in the study;  smile <br>  disappeared from his face, he wrinkled his forehead. <br>  ‚ÄúOh, oh, oh!  Aah! .. ‚Äù- he moaned, remembering all that was.  And his <br>  imagination presented themselves again all the details of the quarrel with his wife, all <br>  the hopelessness of his position and the most painful of all is his own fault. <br>  "Yes!  she will not forgive and cannot forgive.  And the worst thing is that the fault <br>  I am to blame, not guilty.  That's the whole drama, he thought.  - Oh, oh, <br>  ah! "he said with despair, remembering the hardest for himself <br>  impressions from this quarrel. <br>  The most unpleasant of all was that first minute when, after returning from the theater, <br>  cheerful and contented, with a huge pear for his wife in his hand, did not find his wife in <br>  living room;  Surprisingly, I did not find her in the office either, and finally saw her in <br>  the bedroom with the unfortunate, who opened everything, a note in his hand. <br>  She, this ever-preoccupied, and troublesome, and not far away, what he thought <br>  her, Dolly, sat motionless with a note in her hand and with an expression of horror, <br>  despair and anger looked at him. <br>  - What is it?  this?  She asked, pointing to the note. <br>  And with this memory, as is often the case, tormented Stepan Arkadyevich <br>  not so much the event, but how he responded to these words of his wife. <br>  What happened to him at that moment is what happens to people when they <br>  unexpectedly caught in something too shameful.  He failed to cook <br>  his face to the position in which he stood before his wife after <br>  discovery of his guilt.  Instead of being offended, denying, making excuses, <br>  ask for forgiveness, remain even indifferent - everything would be better than what <br>  he did!  - his face is completely involuntarily (‚Äúreflexes of the brain,‚Äù thought Stepan Arkadyevich, who loved physiology), completely unwittingly <br>  suddenly she smiled at a familiar, kind and therefore foolish smile. <br>  He could not forgive himself that stupid smile.  Seeing that smile, Dolly <br>  flinched, as if from physical pain, broke out, with her characteristic <br>  fervor, a stream of cruel words and ran out of the room.  Since then she hasn't <br>  I wanted to see a husband. <br>  ‚ÄúThis stupid smile is to blame,‚Äù thought Stepan Arkadyevich. <br>  ‚ÄúBut what to do?  what to do? "he said to himself with despair and not <br>  found the answer. <br><br><br><br>  Stepan Arkadyevich was a true man in relation to himself.  He is not <br>  could deceive himself and assure himself that he repented of his deed.  is he <br>  could not now repent of the fact that he, thirty-four, handsome, <br>  an amorous man, was not in love with his wife, the mother of five living and two dead <br>  children that was only a year younger than him.  He repented only that <br>  knew how to hide from his wife better.  But he felt the brunt of his position and <br>  I felt sorry for my wife, children and myself.  Maybe he could better hide his sins from <br>  wife, if I expected that this news will affect her so.  Clear he <br>  never considered this question, but vaguely it seemed to him that his wife <br>  has long been aware that he is not faithful to her, and looks at it through his fingers.  His <br>  it even seemed that she, emaciated, aged, already an ugly woman and <br>  nothing wonderful, simple, only kind mother of the family, by feeling <br>  justice must be indulgent.  It turned out quite nasty. <br>  ‚ÄúAh, terrible!  Ah ah ah!  terrible!  - Stepan Arkadyevich repeated to himself and <br>  couldn't think of anything.  - And how good it all was before, how we are good <br>  lived!  She was pleased, sympathetic children, I did not interfere with her in anything, <br>  provided her to mess with the children, with the housework, as she wanted.  True, <br>  it is not good that she was a governess in our house.  Not good!  There is something <br>  trivial, vulgar in grooming your governess.  But what <br>  governess!  (He vividly recalled the black roguish eyes of m-lle Roland and her <br>  smile.) But while she was in our house, I didn‚Äôt allow myself anything., and <br>  worst of all, it is already ... Wow, this is all as if on purpose!  Ah ah ah!  Ayayay! <br>  But what to do? ‚Äù <br>  There was no answer, besides the general answer that gives life to all <br>  the most difficult and intractable questions.  The answer is this: you need to live with the needs <br>  day, that is, forget.  Forgotten sleep is no longer possible, at least until the night <br>  it is no longer possible to return to the music that the decanters-women sang;  has become <br>  to be, you have to forget the sleep of life, <br>  ‚ÄúIt will be seen there,‚Äù Stepan Arkadyevich said to himself, and, getting up, put on a gray <br>  a robe on a blue silk lining, knotted the brushes and taking plenty of <br>  air into your wide chest box, the usual brisk step of twisted legs, <br>  wearing his full body so easily, went to the window, raised the door and loudly <br>  rang the bell.  The old friend, the valet Matvey, immediately entered the bell, carrying <br>  dress, boots and telegram.  Following Matthew came the barber with supplies <br>  for shaving. <br>  - From the presence of paper?  - asked Stepan Arkadyevich, taking <br>  telegram and sitting down to the mirror. <br>  ‚ÄúOn the table,‚Äù answered Matthew, looked inquiringly, with participation, at <br>  and, having waited a little, he added with a sly smile: - From the host <br>  the cab driver came. <br>  Stepan Arkadyevich did not answer anything and only glanced in the mirror. <br>  Matthew;  in the gaze they met in the mirror, it was clear how they <br>  understand each other.  The look of Stepan Arkadyevich seemed to ask: ‚ÄúThis <br>  why are you saying  Do not you know?" <br>  Matvey put his hands in the pockets of his jacket, put his foot down and silently, <br>  kindly, smiling a little, looked at his master. <br>  - I ordered to come on that Sunday, and until then, so as not to be disturbed <br>  you and yourself in vain, - he said, apparently prepared phrase. <br>  Stepan Arkadyevich understood that Matvey wanted to joke and turn on himself <br>  Attention.  Breaking the telegram, he read it, guessing correcting the wrong, <br>  as always, words, and his face lit up. <br>  ‚ÄúMatvey, sister Anna Arkadyevna will be tomorrow,‚Äù he said, stopping <br>  for a minute the glossy, plump handle of the barber clearing the pink road <br>  between the long curly whiskers. <br>  ‚ÄúThank God,‚Äù said Matvey, with this answer showing that he understands <br>  as well as the master, the significance of this visit, that is, Anna Arkadyevna, <br>  Stepan Arkadyevich‚Äôs beloved sister can help reconcile her husband with <br>  wife <br>  - Alone or with a spouse?  - Matthew asked. <br>  Stepan Arkadyevich could not speak, since the barber was busy with the upper <br>  lip, and raised one finger.  Matvey nodded in the mirror. <br>  - alone.  Cook upstairs? <br>  - Darya Alexandrovna report where ordered. <br>  - Darya Alexandrovna?  - as if Matvey repeated doubtfully. <br>  - Yes, report it.  So take a telegram, tell them what they say. <br>  ‚ÄúYou want to try,‚Äù Matvey realized, but he said only: <br>  - I listen, sir. <br>  Stepan Arkadyevich was already washed and combed and gathered to dress when <br>  Matvey, stepping slowly with his creaking boots, with a telegram in his hand, <br>  returned to the room.  The barber was gone. <br>  - Darya Alexandrovna was ordered to report that they were leaving.  Let him <br>  they do whatever you like, that is, please, ‚Äùhe said, laughing only with his eyes, and <br>  putting his hands in his pockets and tilting his head to the side, he stared at the master. <br>  Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent.  Then a kind and somewhat pitiful smile <br>  appeared on his beautiful face. <br>  - BUT?  Matthew?  - He said, shaking his head. <br>  ‚ÄúNothing, sir, is formed,‚Äù said Matthew. <br>  - formed? <br>  - Yes, sir. <br>  - You think?  Who is there?  - asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, hearing at the door <br>  the noise of a woman's dress. <br>  ‚ÄúIt's me,‚Äù said a firm and pleasant female voice, and from behind the door. <br>  the strict pockmarked face of Matrona Filimonovna, the nanny, was stuck out. <br>  - Well, Matresha?  Asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, going out to her at the door. <br>  Despite the fact that Stepan Arkadyevich was to blame for his wife and <br>  he felt it, almost everything in the house, even the nurse, Darya's main friend <br>  Alexandrovna, were on his side. <br>  - Well?  He said dejectedly. <br>  - You go, sir, still obey.  Perhaps God will give.  Very tormented, and <br>  look pity, and everything in the house went wrong.  Children, sir, sorry <br>  need to.  Obey, sir.  What to do!  Love to ride ... <br>  - Why not take ... <br>  - And you do yours.  God is merciful, pray to God, sir, to God <br>  pray <br>  ‚ÄúWell, well, go on,‚Äù said Stepan Arkadyevich, suddenly flushing.  - Well, <br>  so let's get dressed, - he turned to Matvey and resolutely threw off his robe. <br>  - Matvey already held, blowing off something invisible, cooked by a yoke <br>  shirt and with obvious pleasure wrapped in her gentleman's sleek body. <br><br><br><br>  Having dressed, Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled himself with perfume, straightened his sleeves. <br>  shirts, in a habitual movement, stuffed cigarettes in his pockets, a wallet, <br>  matches, a watch with a double chain and key rings and, shaking a handkerchief, feeling <br>  clean, fragrant, healthy and physically cheerful despite their <br>  misfortune went out, slightly trembling on each leg, in the dining room, where he was already waiting <br>  his coffee and, next to the coffee, letters and papers from presence. <br>  He read the letters.  One thing was very unpleasant - from the merchant who bought <br>  forest in the estate of his wife.  This forest needed to be sold;  but now, up <br>  reconciliation with his wife, could not be about that speech.  Overall, there was more unpleasant <br>  that this mixed up the interest of money in the forthcoming work of his reconciliation <br>  with my wife.  And the idea that he can be guided by this interest, that he is <br>  sales of this forest will seek reconciliation with his wife - this thought insulted <br>  him. <br>  Having finished the letters, Stepan Arkadyevich pulled the papers out of his presence to himself, <br>  I quickly turned over two cases, made several marks with a large pencil, and <br>  having put things off, he took up coffee;  for coffee he turned another raw morning <br>  newspaper and began to read it. <br>  Stepan Arkadyevich received and read a liberal newspaper, not extreme, but that <br>  directions, which held the majority.  And, despite the fact that <br>  science, or art, or politics, in fact, did not interest him, he firmly <br>  held those views on all these subjects, which held the majority and his <br>  newspaper, and changed them, only when the majority changed them, or, better <br>  say, did not change them, but they themselves in him imperceptibly changed. <br>  Stepan Arkadyevich did not choose any direction or views, and these <br>  the directions and the views themselves came to him, just as he did not choose <br>  the form of a hat or coat, and took those that are worn.  And to have looks to him <br>  who lived in a certain society, with the needs of some thought activity, <br>  usually developing in summer of maturity, it was as necessary as having <br>  a hat.  If there was a reason why he preferred the liberal direction <br>  conservative, which also held many of his circle, it happened <br>  not because he finds the liberal direction more reasonable, but <br>  because it came closer to his way of life.  Liberal Party <br>  she said that in Russia everything was bad, and indeed, Stepan Arkadyevich <br>  There were a lot of debts, but there was definitely a lack of money.  Liberal Party <br>  She said that marriage was an obsolete institution and that it was necessary to rebuild <br>  he, and indeed, family life, gave little pleasure to Stepan <br>  Arkadyevich and forced him to lie and pretend that he was so disgusted <br>  in kind.  The Liberal Party spoke, or, better, implied that religion <br>  there is only a bridle for the barbarian part of the population, and indeed, Stepan <br>  Arkadyevich could not bear even a short prayer without pain in his legs and could not <br>  understand why all these terrible and pompous words about that world when and on <br>  this would be very fun to live with. At the same time Stepan Arkadyevich, who loved <br>  funny joke, it was a pleasure sometimes to perplex a humble person by saying that if <br>  already proud of the breed, you should not dwell on Rurik and repudiate <br>  from the first ancestor - monkeys.  So the liberal direction <br>  became the habit of Stepan Arkadyevich, and he loved his newspaper like a cigar <br>  after dinner, for the light fog that she made in his head.  is he <br>  I read a leadership article that explained that in our time <br>  it is in vain that a cry is raised that radicalism threatens <br>  devour all conservative elements and supposedly the government is obliged <br>  take steps to suppress the revolutionary hydra, which, on the contrary, ‚Äúin our <br>  opinion, the danger lies not in the imaginary revolutionary hydra, but in the persistence <br>  of the traditionality that inhibits progress, ‚Äùetc. He read another article <br>  financial, in which it was mentioned about Bentam and Millet and thin <br>  studs to the ministry. With the speediness characteristic of him, he understood <br>  the value of any stud: from whom and to whom and on what occasion she was <br>  directed, and this, as always, gave him some pleasure.  But <br>  today the pleasure was poisoned by the memory of Matrona's advice <br>  Filimonovna and that the house is so unfavorable.  He read and that <br>  Earl Beist, as heard, traveled to Wiesbaden, and that there is no more gray <br>  hair, and the sale of a light carriage, and the proposal of a young person;  but these <br>  the information did not give him, as before, a quiet, ironic pleasure. <br>  After graduating from the newspaper, a second cup of coffee and rolls with butter, he got up, shook off <br>  kalachka crumbs from a vest and, straightening his wide chest, smiled happily, not <br>  because he had something particularly pleasant in his soul ‚Äî joyful <br>  a smile caused a good digestion. <br>  But this joyful smile immediately reminded him of everything, and he thought. <br>  Two children's voices (Stepan Arkadyich recognized the voices of Grisha, the youngest <br>  the boy, and Tanya, the older girl) were heard outside the door.  They brought something <br>  and dropped. <br>  ‚ÄúI said you can't put passengers on the roof,‚Äù she screamed. <br>  in English girl - here are pick up! <br>  ‚ÄúEverything is mixed up,‚Äù thought Stepan Arkadyevich, ‚Äúsome children alone run.‚Äù  AND, <br>  going to the door, he clicked them.  They threw a box representing the train <br>  and went in to the father. <br>  The girl, a favorite of her father, ran boldly, hugged him and, laughing, hung from <br>  on his neck, as always, rejoicing at the familiar scent of perfume that spread <br>  from his sideburn.  Having kissed him finally on the reddened from inclined <br>  position and shining face of tenderness, the girl spread her arms and wanted to run <br>  back;  but her father kept her ... <br>  - What mom?  He asked, running his hand over his daughter's smooth, tender neck.  ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù he said, smiling at the hello boy. <br>  He was aware that he loved the boy less, and always tried to be even; <br>  but the boy felt it and did not answer with a smile at his father's cold smile. <br>  - Mama?  I got up, - answered the girl. <br>  Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed.  ‚ÄúSo, I didn‚Äôt sleep all night again,‚Äù thought <br>  he. <br>  - What, she fun? <br>  The girl knew that there was a quarrel between the father and the mother, and that the mother was not <br>  could be cheerful, and that the father should know this, and that he is pretending, <br>  asking about it is so easy.  And she blushed for her father.  He immediately understood <br>  this and also turned red. <br>  ‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù she said.  - She did not order to learn, and ordered to go for a walk <br>  with Miss Gul to her grandmother. <br>  - Well, go, my Tanchika.  Oh yeah, wait, he said, after all. <br>  holding her and stroking her gentle grip. <br>  He pulled from the fireplace.  where I put yesterday, a box of chocolates and gave her two, <br>  choosing her favorite chocolate and fondant. <br>  - Grisha?  Said the girl, pointing to a chocolate one. <br>  - Yes Yes.  - And once again stroking her shoulder, he kissed her roots <br>  hair, in the neck and let her go. <br>  ‚ÄúThe carriage is ready,‚Äù said Matthew.  ‚ÄúYes, the petitioner,‚Äù he added. <br>  - A long time here?  Asked Stepan Arkadyevich. <br>  - From half an hour. <br>  - How many times have you been ordered to report right away! <br>  - We must give you at least some coffee to eat, - said Matvey to those friendly <br>  in a harsh tone that could not be angry. <br>  ‚ÄúWell, ask soon,‚Äù said Oblonsky, wincing. <br>  The petitioner, Captain Kalinin, requested the impossible and <br>  stupid;  but Stepan Arkadyevich, as usual, sat her down, <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">attentively, without interrupting, he listened to her and gave her detailed advice to whom and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">how to turn, and even briskly and smoothly with his large, stretched, beautiful and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">clear handwriting he wrote her a little note to her face that could benefit her. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Letting go of the captain. Stepan Arkadyevich took his hat and stopped, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">remembering whether he had forgotten something. It turned out that he had not forgotten anything, except that </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">he wanted to forget - his wife. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúOh yes!‚Äù He lowered his head, and his beautiful face took on a dreary </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">expression. "Go or not go?" He said to himself. And the inner voice </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">told him that it was not necessary to walk, that, apart from falsehood, there could be nothing here </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, that it was impossible to fix, repair their relationship, because</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">it is impossible to make her again attractive and exciting love, or to </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">make </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">him an </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">old man, unable to love. Apart from falsehood and lies, nothing could </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">come out now; and falsehood and lies were contrary to his nature. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúHowever, sometime it is necessary; after all, it cannot remain so, ‚Äùhe said, trying to give himself courage. He straightened his chest, took out a </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">cigarette, lit a cigarette, puffed twice, threw it into the mother </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">-of- </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">pearl </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ashtray, with quick steps he passed the gloomy drawing room and opened </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">another door to his wife‚Äôs bedroom. </font></font><br><br><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Darya Aleksandrovna, in a blouse and with braids pinned on the back of her head, already </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">rare, once thick and beautiful hair with a drawn-out, thin face and</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">large, frightened eyes, posed out from the thinness of her face, stood among the </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">things scattered around the room before the open wardrobe, from which she </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">chose something. Hearing her husband's footsteps, she stopped, looking at the door and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">trying in vain to give her face a stern and contemptuous expression.</font></font> She is <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">she felt that she was afraid of him and was afraid of an upcoming date. She had just </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tried to do what she was trying to do for the tenth time in those three days: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">take away the children's and her own things that she would take to her mother - and again she </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">could not decide; but now, as in previous times, she told herself </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">that it could not remain so that she should undertake something, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">punish, shame him, revenge him with at least a small part of the pain he </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">did to her. She still said she would leave him, but she felt that this was </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">impossible; it was impossible because she could not let go of considering </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">him to </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">be </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">her husband and to love him. Moreover, she felt that if here, in</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">home, she barely managed to care for her five children, it would be </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">even worse for them where she went with all of them. And then in these three days, the little one </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">fell ill because he was fed bad broth, and the rest were yesterday </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">almost without lunch. She felt it was impossible to leave; but, deceiving herself, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">she nevertheless selected things and pretended to leave. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When she saw her husband, she put her hand into the drawer of the chiffonier, as if searching for </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">something, and looked back at him only when he came right up to her. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But her face, to which she wanted to give a stern and resolute expression, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">expressed lostness and suffering. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúDolly!‚Äù He said in a low, timid voice. He pulled his head into his shoulders and</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I wanted to have a miserable and humble appearance, but he still shone with freshness and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">health. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She glanced from head to foot with his quick glance at his radiant, fresh and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">healthy figure. ‚ÄúYes, he is happy and pleased!‚Äù She thought, ‚Äúand I?! .. And this </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">kindness is disgusting, for which everyone loves him so much and praises him; I hate that </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">kindness of </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">him </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, ‚Äùshe thought. Her mouth clenched, the muscle of her cheeks shook on the right </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">side of her pale, nervous face. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What you need? - She said fast, not her, chest voice. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Dolly! - He repeated with a tremor in his voice. - Anna will arrive today. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, what am I? I can not accept it! She cried. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúBut you must, however, Dolly ...‚Äù</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Go away, go away, go away! - without looking at him, she screamed, as if </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">this scream was caused by physical pain. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stepan Arkadyevich could be calm when he thought about his wife, could hope </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">that everything would be fine, in the words of Matthew, and he could calmly read a newspaper and drink </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">coffee; but when he saw her exhausted, suffering face, he heard the </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sound of voices, obedient to fate and desperate, he caught his breath, something </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">came to his throat, and his eyes glittered with tears. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- My God, what have I done! Dolly!</font></font> For God's sake!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all ... - he could not </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">continue, the sobbing stopped in his throat. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She slammed the chiffonnier and looked at him. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Dolly, what can I say? .. One thing: forgive, forgive ... Remember, unless </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">nine years of life can not atone for minutes, minutes ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She lowered her eyes and listened, expecting what he would say, as if begging </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">him to somehow loosed her. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúMinutes ... minutes of passion ...‚Äù he said and wanted to continue, but </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">at the same time, as if from physical pain, her lips again tightened and the </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">muscle of her cheeks on the right side of her face jumped </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">again </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Get out, get out of here! - she shouted even sharper - and do not </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tell me about your hobbies, about your abominations!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She wanted to leave, but staggered and took up the back of a chair to </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">lean on. His face widened, his lips swelled, his eyes filled with tears. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Dolly! - He said, already sobbing. - For God's sake, think about the children, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">they are not to blame. I am guilty and punish me, led me to atone for my fault. Than </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I can, I'm all ready! I am guilty, there are no words to say how guilty I am! But Dolly, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I'm sorry! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She sat. He heard her heavy, loud breathing, and he was inexpressibly </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sorry for her. She wanted to start talking several times, but she couldn't. He was waiting. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYou remember the children to play with them, and I remember and know that they </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">died now,‚Äù she said, apparently, one of the phrases she </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">had told herself more than once </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in these three </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">days.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She told him ‚Äúyou,‚Äù and he looked at her gratefully and started off </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to take her hand, but she pulled away from him in disgust. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I remember about children and therefore would do everything in the world to save them; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">but I myself do not know how I will save them: whether I take them away from my father, or what I </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">leave with a depraved father - yes, with a depraved father ... Well, tell me, after </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">that ... what happened, is it possible for us to live together ? Is it possible? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tell me, is it possible? She repeated, raising her voice. - After </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">my husband, the father of my children, enters into a love affair with the governess of </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">his children ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- But what to do?</font></font> What to do?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- he said in a pitiful voice, not </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">knowing what he was saying, and lowering his head lower and lower. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYou are disgusting to me, disgusting!‚Äù She shouted, getting more and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">more </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">hot </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Your tears are water! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You never loved me; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">you have neither heart </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">nor nobility! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You are disgusting to me, disgusting, stranger, yes, stranger! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- With pain and anger, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">she uttered this terrible word for herself a stranger. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He glanced at her, and the anger on her face frightened and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">surprised him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He did not realize that his pity for her irritated her.</font></font> She is <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I saw in him regret, but not love. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúNo, she hates me.</font></font> She is <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">don't forgive, ‚Äùhe thought. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- It's horrible! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Awful! ‚ÄùHe said. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this time, in another room, probably falling down, the child screamed;</font></font> Daria <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexandrovna listened, and her face suddenly softened. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She evidently remembered for a few seconds, as if not knowing where she was and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">what she should do, and, having quickly got up, she started off toward the door. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúShe loves my child,‚Äù he thought, noticing the change in her </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">face when the child cried, ‚Äúmy child; how can she hate me? ‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Äú Dolly, another word, ‚Äùhe said, following her. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- If you follow me, I will call people, children!

" Stepan Arkadyevich stood for a few seconds alone, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">wiped his eyes, sighed and, straightening his chest, left the room. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was Friday, and a German watchmaker turned on the clock in the dining room. Stepan Arkadyevich </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">remembered his joke about this neat balding watchmaker that the German ‚Äúwas himself </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">wound up for life, to wind the watch,‚Äù and smiled.</font></font> Stepan <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Arkadyevich loved a good joke. ‚ÄúAnd maybe it will be! Good word: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">formed, he thought. - It is necessary to tell. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúMatvey!‚Äù He shouted, ‚Äúso arrange everything there with Maria in the sitting room for </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anna Arkadevna,‚Äù he said to Matthew. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I listen, sir. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stepan Arkadyevich put on his fur coat and went out onto the porch. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Eat at home will not? - said Matthew. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- As it is necessary.

Do I give milk? Do not send for another chef? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oh, leave, leave me! - She said and, returning to the bedroom, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sat down again at the same place where she spoke with her husband, clenched her skinny hands with the </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">rings coming down from the bony fingers, and began to sort out</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">memories of all the former conversation. ‚ÄúLeft!

He got this place through Anna's sister's husband, Alexei </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexandrovich Karenin, who occupied one of the most important places in the ministry </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to which the presence belonged; but if Karenin had not assigned his </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">brother-in-law to this place, then through a hundred other persons, brothers, sisters, relatives, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">cousins, uncles, aunts, Steve Oblonsky would have received this place or another </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">similar six thousand salaries that he needed, so how are you doing </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">it. in spite of the sufficient condition of the wife, they were upset.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Half of Moscow and St. Petersburg were relatives and friends of Stepan Arkadyevich. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He was born in the midst of those people who were and have become powerful of this world.

It would have </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">seemed ridiculous to him if he had been told that he would not get a place with the </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">salary he needed, especially since he did not demand anything </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">extraordinary; he only wanted what his peers got, and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">he could perform this kind of position no worse than any other. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stepan Arkadyevich was not only loved by everyone who knew him for his kind, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">cheerful disposition and undoubted honesty, but in him, in his beautiful, bright </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">appearance, shining eyes, black eyebrows, hair, whiteness and blush</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the person had something that was physically friendly and fun to the people who </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">met him. ‚ÄúAha!

The main qualities of </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stepan Arkadyevich, who deserved this general respect for his service, consisted of</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">firstly, in extreme condescension to people, based in it on the </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">consciousness of its shortcomings; secondly, in perfect liberality, not the one </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">about which he read in the newspapers, but the one that he had in his blood and with </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">which he treated all people equally and equally to all people, whatever their </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">condition and rank, and , thirdly, - the main thing - in perfect </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">indifference to the business in which he was engaged, as a result of which he was never </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">fond of and did not make mistakes. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Arriving at the place of his ministry, Stepan Arkadyevich, accompanied by a </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">respectful doorman, with a briefcase, went to his small office, put on </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">his uniform, and entered the presence. The scribes and servants all got up, fun and</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">bowing respectfully. Stepan Arkadyevich hastily, as always, went to his </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">place, shook hands with the members and sat down. He joked and talked, exactly how much it </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">was decent, and began classes. No one, more truly Stepan Arkadyevich, was able to find </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">that border of freedom, simplicity and officiality, which is necessary for a pleasant </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">business. The secretary cheerfully and respectfully, like everything in the presence of </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stepan Arkadyevich, came up with the papers and spoke in that </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">familiar liberal tone that Stepan Arkadyevich had introduced: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWe did get information from the Penza provincial government.‚Äù Here, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">do not you like ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Finally got it? Said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laying down the </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">paper </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">with his finger </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. - Well, gentlemen ... - And the presence began.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúIf they knew,‚Äù he thought, with a significant look, bowing his head while </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">listening to the report, ‚Äúwhat a guilty boy half an hour ago was their </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">chairman!‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd his eyes laughed when reading the report ... Until two o'clock the </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">classes had to go without interruption, and at two o'clock - a break and breakfast. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was not yet two o'clock when the large glass doors of the presence hall </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">suddenly opened and someone entered. All the members from under the portrait and from behind the mirror, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">rejoicing at the entertainment, looked at the door; but the watchman, who was standing at the door, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">immediately expelled the man who had entered and shut the glass door behind him. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the matter was read, Stepan Arkadyevich stood, stretching, and,</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">paying tribute to the liberality of time, in the presence he took out a cigarette and went to </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">his office. Two of his comrades, the old handler Nikitin and the chamber junker </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Grinevich, went out with him. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAfter breakfast, we will have time to finish,‚Äù said Stepan Arkadyevitch. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúHow else we will have time!‚Äù Said Nikitin. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúA decent trick should be this Fomin,‚Äù Grinevich said about one </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">of the persons involved in the case that they were investigating. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stepan Arkadyevich frowned at Grinevich's words, making it feel that </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">it was indecent to make a judgment prematurely, and did not answer him. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Who is this included? - He asked the guard. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Some, Your Excellency, climbed without demand, only I</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">turned away. You were asked. I say: when members come out, then ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Where is he? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Neshto went out into the hall, and then everything went here. This same one, said the watchman, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">pointing to a very folded, broad-shouldered man with a curly beard </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">who, without taking off his lamb cap, quickly and easily ran up the worn out </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">steps of the stone staircase. One of the thin </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">officials, who were </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">descending down with a briefcase </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, paused, looked disapprovingly at the legs of the runner, and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">then looked inquiringly at Oblonsky. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stepan Arkadyevich was standing above the stairs. His good-naturedly shining face because of the </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">embroidered collar of his uniform brightened even more when he recognized the man who had run. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And there is! Levin, finally! - he said with a friendly, mocking</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">smile, looking over Levin coming to him. - How did you not scold to </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">find me in this den? Said Stepan Arkadyevich, not content with </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">shaking hands and kissing his friend. - How long? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I have just arrived, and I really wanted to see you," answered Levin, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">shyly and at the same time looking around anxiously and uneasily. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWell, let's go to the office,‚Äù said Stepan Arkadyevich, who knew the proud and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">embittered shyness of his friend; and, seizing him by the hand, he drew </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">him behind him, as if he were passing between dangers. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stepan Arkadyevich was on ‚Äúyou‚Äù with almost all of his acquaintances: with </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">old men of sixty years old, with boys of twenty years old, with actors, with</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ministers, merchants and adjutants-generals, so many of those </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">who were with him on ‚Äúyou‚Äù were at the two extreme points of the public </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">staircase and would be very surprised to learn that they have something in </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">common </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">through Oblonsky </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. He was on ‚Äúyou‚Äù with everyone with whom he drank champagne, and he drank champagne with </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">everyone, and therefore, in the presence of his subordinates meeting with his </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">shameful ‚Äúyou‚Äù, as he called jokingly many of his friends, with his </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">characteristic tact, was able to reduce the nuisance of this impression for </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">subordinates. Levin was not the shameful "you", but Oblonsky with his tact </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">felt that Levin thinks that he may not wish for his subordinates</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to show his intimacy with him, and so he hurried to take him to the office. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Levin was almost the same age with Oblonsky and with him on "you" not one </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">champagne. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Levin was his friend and friend of his first youth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They loved </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">each other, despite the difference in character and taste, as </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">friends </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">love each other</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29947/</a></p>
