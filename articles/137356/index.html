High quality speaker system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> To create this topic I was pushed through <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/131791/">this project</a> (It is of course done incorrectly, but only prof. Columnists will understand me, the filter must be calculated by measuring the frequency response and starting from the case).  In general, I thought that this is not interesting, but it turns out there is interest. <br><br>  Therefore, I want to share with you my design.  Description of the project and a lot of photos further ... <br><br>  The first thing I started with the assembly is of course the choice of speakers.  The system was conceived as a 4-way, so the following dynamics were chosen:

Measurements in the construction of acoustic systems are needed as well as the correct spelling of the dealloc method.  Otherwise, you will get a <s>box with speakers a</s> bad speaker system. <br><br>  For measurements, I used the <a href="http://cxo.lv/index.php/soft/comsoft/92-artasoftwarecomplex">following technique</a> written by my friend, for which a special thanks to him.  The parameters of the speakers spread here I think there is no need for anyone interested to see them <a href="http://www.vegalab.ru/forum/showthread.php/44240-%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-%25D0%2590%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-4-%25D1%2585-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2581-%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC-miniDSP">here</a> (first post). <br><br>  The next stage is the calculation, modeling and assembly of the hull.  I will not go into technical details about calculations and measurements since  it is difficult and long. <br><br>  Also, the system needs amplifiers and a filter.  Chose a <a href="http://minidsp.com/">digital DSP</a> filter <a href="http://minidsp.com/">.</a>  It has a very significant advantage over passive - you can reconfigure the system online.  To do this, connects the filter to the USB and through the software that comes to it we set up as you please.  Settings are applied on the fly i.  when music is playing! <br>  I use channel / multiband (as he calls) amplification, so each speaker has its own separate amplifier.  This gives a good increase in sound quality.  <a href="http://www.vidalgo.com/DYA/pcb-Mau2.htm">For LF-MF-HF channels, I took amps on the LM3886 (30W each).</a>  For SUBnch took <a href="http://audiomodule.com/amp48.html">on the chip LME49830 (100W each)</a> <br>  Well, all this should be put in the case, which I bought <a href="http://www.vt4c.com/shop/program/main.php%3Fcat_id%3D1032%26group_id%3D2%26hit_cat%3D">here</a> . <br><br>  I figured the design of the case, I want to understand how it will look about.  That's what happened (I did not draw). <br><br>  Here immediately marked volumes of cameras for each speaker. <br><img src="http://img848.imageshack.us/img848/4755/11203549.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The thickness of the MDF is 25mm (28mm in the photo above, but when I bought it in the warehouse, there was no other ...), the weight will not be small ... Well, I looked at it and thought that it suits me, but now the finish will probably be of a different color, so it happened ... <br><br>  <b>The assembly process, a lot of photos:</b> <br><br>

I gave the link somewhere in the text above.  Welcome. <br><br>  I just want to say that the most important thing that needs to be understood is that audio is a technology that is based on a solid scientific basis.  Audio is not art, and audio products are not characterized by any artistic characteristics with the exception of appearance.  Therefore, without measurements of the frequency response, phase response, impedance, Til-Small parameters and other "scary" to do anything worthwhile <u>will not work!</u>  Simply take the speakers, make any body for them and put some kind of filter - this will only lead to the creation of a box with speakers ... <br><br>  The sound of this system has turned out very good quality.  I am not a whale to describe what you need to listen, I can only say that if you want approximately the same quality, then the store needs to fork out at $ 10,000 - $ 15,000, these are industrial options. <br><br>  Thank you all for your attention and I am glad that you have mastered so many photo text. <br><br>  UPD: Thank you for inviting <b>sergeypid</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137356/</a></p>
