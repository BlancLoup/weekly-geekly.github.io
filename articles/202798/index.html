During this time, we carefully collected feedback and suggestions, implemented them in the new service.  Thank you for the suggestions you made.

Now you can earn extra money by posting a link to our services.  This post will tell you about 11 reasons why you should join our affiliate program.

If you are seriously engaged in attracting customers - welcome!  We will provide you with comfortable conditions. <br><br><h2>  Remuneration period </h2><br>  Many companies pay a fee only for a certain period.  For example, for the first year, for a month, or in general only from the first payment. <br><br>  Our view is fundamentally different from similar approaches.  We continue to pay fees for the entire period of the user.  As long as the client pays us - we continue to pay the partner. <br><br><h2>  Convenient ways to attract customers </h2><br>  Our affiliate program allows you to attract customers in three ways: <br><br><ul><li>  By referral link; </li><li>  Without a referral link, from a verified domain; </li><li>  Enter the referral number at registration. </li></ul><br><br>  You can use any method convenient for you. <br><br><h2>  Earn more! </h2><br>  The price of our services on VDS often exceeds the services of other providers.  We have never set ourselves the task of being cheaper.  Our main goal is to provide quality services.  We use fast and powerful SSD servers.  The unique control panel developed by us makes working with services pleasant and easy.  All this makes our service especially valuable to users. <br><br>  Due to this, the partner who has attracted a client to us earns more. <br><br><h2>  Second level referral program </h2><br>  In addition to attracting customers, you can attract other partners.  In this case, you will additionally earn 10% of the amount earned by the attracted partner from the first payments of his clients. <br><br>  This will allow you to earn income even when a partner invited by you engages customers. <br><br><h2>  AppleTime </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/447/32d/be7/44732dbe74f85f9603ce4a6f4aa01f87.jpg"><br><br>  For our partners, we hold a regular AppleTime campaign, on which we give gifts to our best partners.  Take part in the action can any webmaster. <br><br>  Reports on promotions we publish on the site: <br><br>  <a href="http://timeweb.com/ru/partners/apple_time_2/winners_2011/">timeweb.com/en/partners/apple_time_2/winners_2011</a> <br>  <a href="http://timeweb.com/ru/partners/apple_time_2/winners_2013/">timeweb.com/ru/partners/apple_time_2/winners_2013</a> <br><br><h2>  Quality services </h2><br>  Often partners recommend provider services on forums and their own sites. <br><br>  We do not save on equipment, constantly monitor the market and introduce new technologies.  Our servers are reliable and powerful, the updated control panel is convenient and fast.  Therefore, we affirm that our services are among the highest quality on the market. <br><br>  Members of our affiliate program can be confident in their recommendations. <br><br><h2>  Low minimum payouts </h2><br>  Often the affiliate program limits webmasters to the amount paid.  Until you accumulate the required amount - the money will be frozen on the account. <br><br>  We have a minimum amount of only 390 rubles. <br><br><h2>  We work with legal entities and individual entrepreneurs </h2><br>  We are able and love to work with partners - legal entities and individual entrepreneurs.  This will allow you to receive money directly to the current account and pay taxes yourself, which means you will receive exactly the amount that was accrued during the period of work of the clients attracted by you. <br><br><h2>  Transparent conditions and legislation </h2><br>  Working with us, you can always be sure that our joint work is in the field of Russian legislation.  All payments are officially through the bank. <br><br>  If you work as an individual, we pay income tax from the accumulated money, and we pay additional insurance premiums for you (i.e., they are not deducted from your money).  At any time you can get help 2-NDFL, which will indicate how much you earn. <br><br>  Thus, we can help you get a loan =) <br><br><h2>  Promotional materials </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/181/bfa/fd4/181bfafd443a06dd953c6a47348f466a.png"><br><br>  We have prepared an excellent set of promotional materials for our partners, which will allow to better attract customers.  You can get the source code to insert a banner or button in the control panel of webmasters: <a href="https://wm.timeweb.ru/pr/">wm.timeweb.ru/pr</a> <br><br>  We will be happy to answer all questions in the comments or by E-mail: <a href="">partner@timeweb.ru</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202798/</a></p>
