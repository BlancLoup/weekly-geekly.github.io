  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Platform for online tutoring in Russia: a view from the inside</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This time we will talk about how the project team <a href="http://www.tutoronline.ru/">Tutoronline.ru</a> developed a specialized software for online tutors and based on it created a new site in Runet. <br><br>  As you already know from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tutoronline/blog/142987/">previous article</a> , 2 years ago our startup appeared in RuNet, it allows schoolchildren and students to work with teachers on the Web.  It would seem, why do we need such a project when there is Skype and CMS like Moodle.  But in fact, for remote tutoring you need a lot more features: a database of teachers, their constant online presence, automatic distribution of client requests, a time counter for classes, recording of logs, connecting electronic payment systems, drawing tools and much more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a1/c0d/abb/1a1c0dabbe1b75a1c06f85c18203a7b0.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Initially, we planned to buy a ready-made platform, but then we decided to develop our own software.  This slowed down the launch, but in this way we were able to develop the project in the right direction and received intellectual rights to the result of the development. <br><br>  We found excellent programmers and jointly decided to work on the basis of JavaScript and the Microsoft Silverlight platform.  Of course, in this choice there is a big minus - users of our site should download a special browser plugin.  But, at the same time, they get a simple and understandable system with the necessary functionality: <br><ul><li>  video of all lessons </li><li>  fixing of payment and time of occupation, </li><li>  personal account of the teacher and student, </li><li>  ‚ÄúWhiteboard‚Äù is a training board for collaboration (here's a <a href="http://www.tutoronline.ru/whiteboard/practice.aspx">demo version</a> - go in, test it). </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98b/d69/87a/98bd6987ad8f64cfb2fca272385e79e5.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e29/b69/838/e29b69838717519d5a8d418636e89e67.jpg"><br><br>  In general, while we are satisfied.  ‚ÄúWhiteboard‚Äù had to be changed three times, each time connecting new functions.  At first it was an analogue of Peint, then we added mathematical formulas, the ability to share files, insert pictures and texts.  We also changed the position of the chat (at first it was up, now - on the right).  Plans to expand tools for mathematics and physics. <br><br>  The most difficult task is voice transmission.  Following the example of American companies, we abandoned the video link.  First of all, because of the ethical aspects of communication between the child and the adult.  Secondly, to create a more relaxed atmosphere of occupation (if you want, sit in a T-shirt and burst a sandwich). <br><br>  So good voice chat - that was task number one.  At the launch stage (last spring), our system was rather weak, we only finalized it by autumn.  As a result, we got an option that could actually be used for classes, without much fear for the quality of communication. <br><br>  But there is still a lot of work.  Two months ago, we ordered an audit of a technical platform, evaluated its scalability, and considered strengths and weaknesses.  Overall, the conclusion was good.  They gave a number of recommendations to the voice: we need to develop additional low-level voice data transmission protocols in order to achieve sound quality comparable to Skype.  We will introduce them this summer to create an updated version of voice chat for the new academic year. <br><br>  <b>How our system works on the site <a href="http://www.tutoronline.ru/">www.tutoronline.ru</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99c/edb/ac3/99cedbac31a97374bcf2e0f078bc0bad.jpg" align="left">  <i>What does the student see?</i> <br><br>  The scheme of work is standard: the student registers, chooses the desired subject, the class and formulates his question.  After that, he gets into the virtual classroom, where he communicates with the tutor via chat and uses ‚ÄúWhiteboard‚Äù.  At the end of the session, the time of the lesson is noted in the student‚Äôs personal account.  For convenience of payment, we have connected almost all electronic and cash payment systems.  And to test the service, all users get 25 minutes of free work with tutors. <br>  This year we also organized a section for students (in foreign languages, tower and computer science). <br><br>  <i>How does the project work from the inside?</i> <br><br>  We have freelance teachers.  They were selected, confirmed diplomas, completed verification sessions and testing on the subject.  Ideally, tutors in all school subjects should be online all the time to instantly answer any questions.  But, given the small download, we have brought online so far only the most popular subjects - mathematics and Russian, the rest are available on request. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/51f/2fb/367/51f2fb367df2d66b6ae2672cb21aa983.jpg"><br><br>  To ensure that user requests are processed within a minute, we have curators in the state in subjects.  They are at the same time teachers and directional managers, track each session of their ward teachers, find tutors for long-term classes and most importantly: they track how many teachers are online and whether they manage to answer users' questions.  If a student waits more than 90 seconds, the curator will accept the application and conduct the lesson. <br><br>  In our plans - to bring all the items online and go to work around the clock (currently working from 10 to 22 in Moscow).  As for the technical side of the project, here we expand the scalability of individual services of the project (with increasing load we include additional processing servers ‚Äî scale out, and in the future we want to bring individual services into cloud computing), and also realize the cross-browser ‚ÄúWhiteboard‚Äù.  Now supported browsers for Windows: IE, FF, Chrome, Safari (Opera is not in this list).  Also in the next release will be added support for Safari for Mac OS (we are not working with Linux yet). <br><br>  So, we briefly described the development of the project <a href="http://www.tutoronline.ru/">Tutoronline.ru</a> (we don‚Äôt want to bore you with the details in one article).  Perhaps you are interested in specific technical and organizational aspects of our resource - write, we will answer your questions in the comments and in the following articles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143284/</a></p>
