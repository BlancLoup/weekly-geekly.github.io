And for this anniversary, we would like to tell you - 22 unexpected, unique and just funny facts about the devices of this brand that you probably did not know. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  The design of the ThinkPad notebook was inspired by Bento's original Japanese lunch box.  Laconic, orderly, tasteful. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ac/6fe/e52/7ac6fee5208c4b5ea46dc3da56bad913.jpg"><br></li><li>  The very name of the ThinkPad also became the fruit of inspiration.  The look of the creator fell on ... notebook.  The usual notebook for records, leather-bound, on which there was only one word: Think (Think).  These notebooks were all employees of the company. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/335/a84/16a/335a8416af8b46679e0423d12f380fa8.jpg" width="189"><br></li><li>  By the way, the very first ThinkPad was a tablet.  (Yes, tablet!) The stylus for the ThinkPad 700T was created in 1992.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D99l1YR3DhCo">Listen to Howard Dulani's story about this.</a> </li><li>  A lot of ThinkPad notebooks are borrowed from automotive technology.  For example, they have a built-in motion sensor that tracks the sharp movements of a computer in space.  In case of danger, he gives a command to emergency stop the hard drive.  And top-end devices get a shockproof magnesium alloy cocoon operating on the principle of sports cars. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eXMAL-lWQBM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgySWhwZXtvFRlYrsaIwExwjW4Nig" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></li><li>  The material from which the casing of the ThinkPad notebooks was created is also used in aviation and in Formula 1 racing. </li><li>  What is common between a ThinkPad and an owl?  Night walk and owl watching put Lenovo's engineer on the operating principle of the internal fan.  The current blades of the coolers have a unique design, created on the principle of the feathering of the wing of this night bird.  Therefore, they work quietly, but effectively. </li><li>  The ThinkPad 701C had a reclining screen and a full-sized keyboard nicknamed the butterfly, which was noticeably wider than the main dimensions of the device when it was decomposed into a working state.  It was an innovation of the time, which you can find out by <a href="http://blog.lenovo.com/author/dwhill/">reading the blog of David Hill</a> , vice president of Lenovo Corporate Identity &amp; Design. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/526/4ae/c40/5264aec40d014db8b110e4ceb89c25b4.jpg"><br></li><li>  By the way, it is this very butterfly keyboard that has been part of the collection that has been assembled at the Museum of Modern Art in New York since 1995. </li><li>  And again about the butterfly.  The designer, engaged in the development of the keyboard, once played with his daughter in a puzzle.  And he was attracted by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa two-part keyboard, which would have been decomposed into a full-sized one when the ThinkPad 701C screen was opened.  This development, significant for that time, made it possible to equip a compact laptop with a keyboard, with which it would be comfortable to work. </li><li>  Bond  James Bond.  Pad  ThinkPad.  They met in the film Golden Eye in 1995. The agent contacted him using a laptop of the 701st model. </li><li>  In the films, ThinkPad 701 is <a href="http://www.starringthecomputer.com/computer.html%3Fc%3D205">not uncommon</a> .  For example, in ‚ÄúBlood Diamond‚Äù (Blood Diamond), this laptop helped Jennifer Connelly successfully play the role of a journalist. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c7/1f9/f06/2c71f9f0629f4489ae20f23d5025557a.jpg"><br></li><li>  Yes, and "Transformers"!  In the ‚ÄúDark Side of the Moon,‚Äù a Decepticon nicknamed ‚ÄúBrains‚Äù goes to the side of the Autobots.  And it was created from ThinkPad Edge.  See for yourself! <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TiMGxDMMPUA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgCee3gRJ7dKGQESW7xulYgdp6yRQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></li><li>  ThinkPad is also actively used in space.  The first flight of this brand's laptop made on the shuttle Endeavor on December 2, 1993, to take part in the repair of the Hubble Space Telescope.  And now, for example, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOe1MGTYM5uc">ThinkPad helps on the ISS</a> . </li><li>  The ThinkPad T400s survived and remained operational after an 11-ton truck rolled through it! <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZ12BGc72KI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiTTa9H_gYYQr0C2CTZPEdMw_Zb8Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></li><li>  At any time, there is a demand for special protected laptops, and you knew that many ThinkPad models easily pass the specialized test lab MilSpes?  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DZfuX8PE0mj4">Here!</a> </li><li>  And again, Japan.  This time the railway.  The updated textures for the ThinkPad touchpad, sample of 2009, are taken from special markup for the poorly seeing people with whom Japanese stations are equipped.  So it is more convenient to find it by touch. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/162/2f0/033/1622f003323a4ef198313c3defa52d6d.jpg"><br></li><li>  The shape of the rubber "legs" of the laptop on the bottom of the device appeared thanks to the cat's paw.  More precisely, its soft pad. </li><li>  In 1999, ThinkPad became the leader in the mini-laptop industry, as it had all the necessary ports for peripherals and a full keyboard. </li><li>  The world's first laptop transformer with a removable docking station was the model ThinkPad 570 in 1999 </li><li>  The ThinkPad W700ds, which appeared in 2009, was the first dual-monitor workstation in its class. </li><li>  For each component Lenovo ThinkPad is responsible a whole rather big department.  For example, a group of 10 people is responsible for that blue ThinkVantage button, which is a tool for self-restoring a laptop and helping the owner solve a problem far from civilization. </li><li>  ThinkPad notebooks are avid travelers: in 2006, the <a href="http://blog.lenovo.com/events-initiatives/thinkpad-on-mount-everest">ThinkPad</a> notebook <a href="http://blog.lenovo.com/events-initiatives/thinkpad-on-mount-everest">traveled to the top of Everest</a> with a team of researchers from Exploration Specialists, Inc., and in 2007 took a walk along the Nile with the Travel Club. </li></ol><br><br>  These are the interesting 22 facts that have accumulated over the 22 years of the ThinkPad.  What will be the next years and what facts will they fill?  While we do not know.  We can only guess that it will be something interesting and unexpected.  And we know for sure that for the next 22 years we are going to stay with our loyal users who are ready to take our devices anywhere - on Everest, in space, and under water.  And we know for sure that the ThinkPad won't let you down. </div>
