And, you will laugh - after watching an advertising video.  Moreover, after watching the video of the company in which I am currently working.  As a rule, by analogy with one of the signs that the girl is married (she wanted to get married before, but now she does not want), corporate PR products very soon begin to cause at least a rejection on a subconscious level.  And my today's ‚Äúkink‚Äù is not an exception: I didn‚Äôt really like the video, the girl is not in my taste, and it‚Äôs even somehow scary for Opera browser users - what a terrible future they are waiting for, hopeless dependence on software products logo in the form of the letter "O" ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But something hooked.  At first, I did not understand what it was.  I looked a couple more times.  And ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù gradually began - no, not in the sense that the advertisement worked.  I'm still far from marasmus, I hope.  Moreover, the initial viewing experience has not changed for the better.  But what is surprising: the fact that I was hooked, even, probably, was not included in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe authors of the video.  It is believed that such a turn of events indicates the talent of the author of the video - well, perhaps.  Then he respect and respect.  But the topic is still not about him.  And not even about his video (albeit about). <br><br>  First of all - about the future that is so rosyly described in the video.  As follows from the plot, it will be possible not to part with a mobile device for a whole day, while constantly using it to ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with the refrigerator, or to view the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù in the ‚Äúsocialist network‚Äù, or simply sharing the video signal with the boss.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/Ilya%20Shpan%27kov/files/ovideo1.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  But the first thing that immediately begins to "interfere" with the stupefaction: let, what the hell is the future, this is the same real present!  No, of course, it‚Äôs just as easy as a girl, if you don‚Äôt spend the day poking a mobile phone into clothes in a shop or into a TV. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/Ilya%20Shpan%27kov/files/ovideo2.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  And the present is because all these technologies are already implemented in Opera, it remains only to wait until the rest are pulled up.  But here, at the moment of this ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù, the very fright for the user is born: well, what is it for, is it like sticking a mobile phone to a hand from birth, all the same it will not let him go for a minute with such and such a digital surroundings.  However, I also figured out this question for myself.  By analogy. <br><br>  Here, for example, everyone saw this "parade of hangers" on the podium during some fashion show.  Yes, not a single girl in her right mind and in sober memory will come out in IT.  It is equivalent to moral suicide, at least.  But here are some of the <i>elements</i> of the presented nonsense of the next "Cardin" will still be in use.  That's absolutely the same thing with this abundance of Opera in the video: only a sick person will rush with a misted cell phone all day long, as the girl who hasn‚Äôt liked me many times already mentioned.  But to use this or that technology shown in the video in real life - and why, in fact, not? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/Ilya%20Shpan%27kov/files/ovideo4.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  For example, if you can use the same mobile phone to pay for goods in a store, I personally would like this feature.  But I‚Äôm a sane person and immediately begin to "warm up" about the security of such transactions, data security, and other blah blah blah ... And now comes the second "insight" - damn it, but the Norwegians were prudent and sometimes harm to the popularity of their browsers while maintaining the image of the safest browser.  And if you think a little, then the sluggishness of the development of Dragonfly finds its explanation: the Norwegians do it with a margin of demand in the future, with an eye to developing those same mobile applications and services that will then quickly help the girl who doesn‚Äôt like me to choose the product in the next boutique or order the refrigerator mineral water. <br><br>  And, you know, respect for these developers is added somehow.  They do not pursue short-term success, but purposefully solve their problems, knowing what the result should be.  Let today there will be a lag in something, someone will have time to enjoy a glass of champagne with a toast to another victory, but in the future ... And in the future, the former "champions" will be forgotten, but high-quality and reliable software will always be in price.  And, most importantly, timely, modern, and meeting current needs.  And even a little anticipating them. <br><br>  Here is such a stream of consciousness turned out.  Probably - it looks like a no less tedious PR, like the video itself.  But the word of honor is quite adequate and sincere thoughts.  Neither for money, nor under the promise to the administration, just like that.  I wanted to say - and said.  On behalf of the notorious ordinary user.  Therefore, I do not publish it in the ‚Äúfirm‚Äù opera blog, and I don‚Äôt give a link to the video from the principle - I'm not talking about the video, actually ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58502/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58502/</a></p>
