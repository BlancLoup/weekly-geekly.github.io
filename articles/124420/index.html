  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Month with a generator of beautiful QR codes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day we were visited by a funny idea - to analyze QR codes that are <a href="http://android-mobile.ru/qr-code/generator">generated by users</a> .  The results were, on the one hand, somewhat predictable, on the other - surprised, and on the third - even amused. <a name="habracut"></a><br><habracut><br><br><h4>  About prosaic </h4><br>  Most often, users encrypt names, data from their business cards, email addresses or links to websites.  And among the commonplace (a la Ivanov Sergey and Tatiana Sokolova) were also very peculiar names, surnames.  Kadygrob Denis, Shalava Olga Nikolaevna (interestingly, the maiden name or already “by her husband”), Pidosyuk Oleg Alexandrovich and Popandopulo Vyacheslav were especially remembered. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e7297f59/d9a67682/59024efb/b2e1534b.png">  The second, rather extensive category includes “about nothing” codes: “test”, “ytsuke”, “123456”, “qwerty”, “lyalyala”, “+++++” and the like.  Well, what do you say here?  Fantasy, alas, is not given to everyone.

      In third place in popularity - codes, expressions of feelings.  There were also the English "I love you", and the German "Ich liebe dich", and the French "Je T" aime.  Next to the encrypted "Sun, I love you" and "Little hare, you're the best" successfully coexist "Marseille, a fool" and "You poop tratata". <br><br>  I am glad that users who want to confess their love are 10 times more than those who, with the help of a QR code, strive to show their not-too-friendly attitude.  Someone even decided to tell his director about his exclusivity - “Irina, you are the best director”.  Strange, but no one guessed using the QR code to make an offer to the girl. <br><br>  It didn’t do without political sentiments, and here, most likely, the Belarusians brothers tried: “Look in the Ass”, “But father's furnace” and known today to every Belarusian “SCO”.  And the Russians let us down: the codes about one of the Putin-Medvedev couple never met. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/62d3324c/2f883eb1/ee751462/9d032fc2.png"><br>  Many users generated lines from poems.  The leader was “Our Tanya cries loudly” - they remembered about the sobbing girl already 5 times.  Things are much worse with the school curriculum: if Pushkin still knows someone (“I am writing to you, what is more”), then Lermontov, Yesenin, or Nekrasov are undeservedly forgotten at all.  It is also strange that it did not occur to anyone to generate lines of songs.  Of the “music” QR codes, only “Donkey, gopher, spider, and sodgy” and “before remi fi sol la si” were “caught”.  The last code, by the way, attracted by its blood-red coloring and menacing, written on the code itself, the phrase “I will kill”.  More confirmation of how our expectations are often completely at odds with what we received. <br><br><h4>  Go to the original </h4><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1f8dcd25/3a4f8bbf/e2187268/82853df9.png"><br>  QR codes are much less common, the creators of which showed a share of fantasy and humor.  But they are.  We managed to "catch": <br><br><ul><li>  call "Join the ranks of straights" </li><li>  warning “Spin cash from the state.  Caution - danger!" </li><li>  “Plan for the future” “I will soon go to the bazaar and buy a samovar.  I will drink tea " </li><li>  surprise "and you were not too lazy to decipher" </li><li>  a plea “And if there is an error?  If there was an error ... Only there would be an error ... ”. </li></ul><br><br>  Some users with the help of a QR-generator manage to conduct dialogue among themselves: <br><ul><li>  "Will you come today?" </li><li>  "Come today" </li><li>  “Karoche Katya chota is silent = (We’re getting tired again with you” </li></ul><br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7b8ee73c/61025c0d/8055ac9d/3c789865.png"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ebec434a/bf1fcade/24f59311/2d31150a.png"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/06e13ee6/9946eb2c/597ddb51/de49e371.png"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Probably, Katya represented the evening in a completely different way, so she was silent.  Try to offer "dinner and massage", you see, lady and agree. <br><br><ul><li>  “Kukusya sweet, where are you?” </li><li>  "I'm here" </li><li>  "And I'm here" </li><li>  "Maybe coffee?" </li><li>  "Maybe right away?" </li></ul><br><br>  True, what ended this communication, we do not know.  Hopefully, the girl appreciated the joke and the meeting was still pleasant. <br><br>  And we don’t know if one of the generated codes can be attributed to “the original ... But now we are the owners of these credit cards.  Yet our visitors would do well to be more careful. <br><br><h4>  Personal for developers </h4><br>  Some users generated codes targeting <a href="http://android-mobile.ru/qr-code/generator">generator</a> developers.  One was not too lazy to express expressively, “You’ve already kicked off with your cr codes!”  But there were much more pleasant messages: “Super Generator”, “Cool, I like”, “Hello developers - prog zashib”, “Guys, peshite ischo” versions).  In general, be that as it may, attention to our personalities always seduces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1ebc6b24/a46500f1/a09c17c6/cea49fd2.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/041a740e/bcea5201/e70d7df2/738a5d7e.png"><br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to highlight some users, in particular, our regular customers.  Almost every day codes are generated dedicated to the Darwin Museum and its website <a href="http://www.darwin.museum.ru/">www.darwin.museum.ru</a> .  By the way, in the Darwinian Museum, owners of devices with applications that recognize QR codes will not need a guide - all the necessary information is encrypted in the codes hung everywhere.  As well as an incredible activity is shown by the online store of moonshine, which encrypts not only the data on the models sold, but also introduces popular wisdom in the spirit of "Moonshine is your enemy, drive it yourself."  This resource was the first among those who hosted <a href="http://android-mobile.ru/qr-code/generator">our codes</a> . </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124420/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124420/</a></p>
