  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Elections 2010 in Ukraine. Inside view</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The evening of January 17, 2010 is the time when the presidential elections in Ukraine officially ended.  So, as it was on a specific example of me.  On Wednesday, I came from the capital to my hometown ‚Äî Nikolaev, in order to fulfill my civic duty ‚Äî to put a ‚Äúcross‚Äù on the candidate I supported.  But when I visited my polling station number 85 on the same Wednesday, January 13, in the premises of the boarding school, it turned out that my name was not on the lists.  Parents have, I "lost." <a name="habracut"></a>  After an on-site consultation, I was asked to go to the Board and apply for inclusion in the lists.  The next day, that is, on Thursday, the 14th, I, having spent an hour on the road, in snow and ice, wrote the application safely, the girls students opened my passport and with the words ‚Äúcall‚Äù, sent back. <br>  On Friday, ignoring the advice to "call", once again went to the polling station.  It turned out that last night they had the voter lists updated, but they still didn‚Äôt find me there ... Again, another official advised me to go to the Executive Committee again and check what happened with my statement.  And, like there ... "Our song is good, start from the beginning ...".  This time, the girls printed out and, with me, assured the head of the Notice that I and three other citizens needed to be added to the lists.  Moreover, the head himself called the polling station and said that these additional lists were sent to Territorial constituency No. 129. One thing remained unclear to me - who should have taken these additional lists - or sent to the polling station itself, or representatives of the polling station were obliged to take these documents?  One thing I know for sure if the Chairman of the commission rested his horn on his political views or principles, and would not accept these ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù from me, this piece of paper, I would have to run around the courts as a steamed horse on Sunday and prove that I am me.  Conclusion: the organization on the ground is zero, every gopher is an agronomist! <br>  In general, on Saturday night I had a notice in my hands, which gave me hope for tomorrow's will.  And on Sunday, I put the plus sign surprisingly without incident.  It turns out they did find those additional lists and my duplicate document was no longer needed.  So, already at 12 o'clock in the afternoon I went to wait for the announcement of the preliminary results of exit polls. <br><br>  And now about sore.  At 2:00 am, these results look like this: <br>  Yanukovych - 38% <br>  Tymoshenko - 27% <br>  Tigipko - 14% <br>  Yatsenyuk - 8% <br>  Yushchenko - 6% <br>  The results look like this, but their reliability is no longer important, in any case, they are constantly updated.  But the question is not even that.  For me it is absolutely not clear how, why, why?  Everything seems to me as in a caricature: a little man jumps over a large puddle and crashes into the wall.  Result: by inertia, the little man, covering his fifth point with a swamp, returns to its original position.  At what the start was standing, return - lying on the shoulder blades.  But I'm not talking about that.  This is all passing.  And to say that I am not happy with such a choice or even the absence of the upcoming choice in the second round is just a squeak against the wind. <br>  How it will be, in the near future we will see, and we can survive, and maybe we will have to go skiing and migrate, in any case, it‚Äôs worth preparing for migration now. <br>  Arguments?  Yes, having a less shaky one, only a weak business that has risen to its feet is under a government that strives to be, I think it will be swept away and not noticed.  And since I have no influential acquaintances of the ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù, I cry over the fragments of my financial formation.  And I do not even know what to choose - a fist or money?  Bandyuki or bandyuki?  Chic choice is not it?  I am not ready to just pay for my small desk, whose monthly income is barely enough for me alone, for official taxes to the state, and excuse me, to pay this and that and that, poke on my pockets ‚Äî I have no money. <br>  The second.  I am a citizen of Ukraine.  I spent my development as a person in an independent state.  As a lawyer by education, it is quite difficult for me to change my civil positions and personal values.  I am the whole - and without a sovereign independent homeland I can hardly imagine myself.  It is difficult to understand, but for most people I probably have a hypertrophied perception of reality.  I am not for the policy of the past president (let him build monuments of our history, I am against monuments to myself. I am against tsarism, I‚Äôm for having not only duties but also rights), but I don‚Äôt like the future candidates' main policies.  It is much more pleasant to conduct relations ‚Äúpresident = people‚Äù at the business level, but it‚Äôs even scary for me to learn how to work with a hairdryer.  I learned to live in the new law, I do not know how to go back, and I do not understand why.  Why resurrect the administrative - command structure of the government?  Why be meat, weak-willed human unit in the list? </div>
