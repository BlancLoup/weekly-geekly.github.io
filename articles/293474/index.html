We, as developers of CMS and SaaS platforms, share our experience on these two models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9d5/108/dc9/9d5108dc975982f655bd09449b3fd117.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Our company has been on the software market for more than 5 years.  During this time, we are well aware of the fact that for effective business it is necessary to constantly monitor modern technologies in the field of website management, marketing and conversion optimization.

      In addition, our online agency provides personalization service online store or corporate website.  Thus, we are always ‚Äúin touch‚Äù with our customers and partners, and their feedback and suggestions help to make the product as convenient and easy as possible. <br><br>  We will try to describe our user experience and the developer of various platforms in order to provide a comprehensive vision of the problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/099/49b/825/09949b8250cfc167a3391e1efdec40ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  User benefits of CMS </h3><br>  <b>1. The user gets access to the kernel files of the system and the ability to "finish" it for themselves</b> <br>  This feature is especially useful when you need to make a specific opportunity for your needs.  But there is always a nuance: if you change the kernel files of any platform, consider that from now on, updates are not available to you, or are only available through a developer. <br><br>  <b>2. The user has the opportunity to choose any hosting with any configuration.</b> <br>  This is an important option, since the myth is spread that the owner of the SaaS service also owns all the information of the user's resource, i.e., it is not possible to collect your data.  In fact, this is extremely rare, and most often it is simply an imperfect data import mechanism. <br><br>  <b>3. The user has a greater choice of modules, because there are always informal modules.</b> <br>  This moment can be partially confirmed by the fact that it takes a little longer for the SaaS platform administration to check its module.  In addition, the possibility of unofficial sale of the module under the "zero" platform is excluded. <br><br><h3>  Benefits CMS for the developer </h3><br>  <b>1. Limited responsibility for launching an online store</b> <br>  Developers are not responsible for other servers, for the stable operation of the platform after third-party changes.  The advantage is that it is possible to shift the responsibility for the work of the platform to the partners, and to devote more time to assembling the software product. <br><br>  <b>2. Limited support</b> <br>  On the established test period, support, of course, is provided free of charge.  This is followed by regular assistance with the established payment. Thus, an additional and permanent income of the company and a stable work of the technical support team are carried out. <br><br>  <b>3. Paid access to updates every next year.</b> <br>  Similarly with support: the ability to earn money on access to updates and new versions of the platform.  For the developer, this is a good motivation to constantly maintain and develop the platform. <br><br>  <b>4. Support for additional modules and customers by partners</b> <br>  This option will save on the support department and focus more on development and sales. <br><br>  <b>5. There is no need to raise the cloud infrastructure to support the platform as a whole.</b> <br>  Do not underestimate the complexity of "raising" the cloud service.  Full configuration, stabilization of modules and debugging of all processes took more than six months of work of our team.  In the future, all this infrastructure needs to be maintained, and therefore expanding the staff with additional engineers with a narrow specialization. <br><br>  <b>6. Large one-time payment by the client</b> <br>  A weighty argument, especially if you are launching such a product on your own, without investments capable of supporting your team for the first year or two.  On the other hand, it is possible to enter a longer period for the minimum payment.  We have chosen just such a way to provide users with more opportunities, and to ourselves - the means for active development of the SaaS service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/66e/c1d/7a5/66ec1d7a5094ee741a1a9671accdc4eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  User SaaS Benefits </h3><br>  <b>1. The user receives an optimized hosting for the online store.</b> <br>  Now, during the instability of the dollar, this is a particularly important factor.  The speed of the site, as well as the cost of server resources, directly depends on the correct server settings.  For some providers, the cost of hosting an online store (with the number of products over 10,000 and attendance over 1000 per day) can be much higher than the cost of the SaaS service. <br><br>  <b>2. Always up-to-date software</b> <br>  One of the most important indicators, because technology does not stand still and is constantly evolving.  In the case of using cms, the owner is expected to have regular expenses for programmers who will update the platform.  Or you can use ‚Äúautomatic‚Äù or ‚Äúmanual‚Äù update methods, risking your data. <br><br>  <b>3. Continued access to technical support</b> <br>  Payment of technical support is often included in the payment of SaaS-service, and this is another weighty argument in favor of this product. <br><br><h3>  Benefits of SaaS for a developer </h3><br>  In this case, you have control over all aspects of the business in your hands, with all the pros and cons. <br><br>  <b>1. Regular payment and the ability to focus on existing customers</b> <br>  A very important point, allowing in the long run to build a strong business with a steady income.  For us, this was the main choice in favor of developing a similar service. <br><br>  <b>2. Much lower cost of technical support</b> <br>  Valuable opportunity to simultaneously update all users of the platform or add some patch within all user accounts.  There is also no need to work with the configuration of various hosting sites, depend on third parties, etc. <br><br>  <b>3. No need to release new versions, patches, monitor user updates.</b> <br>  All these moments in the case of using the SaaS platform remain exclusively in the programming and testing department. <br><br><h3>  So what is the result? </h3><br>  In general, due to constant updates and feedback, the product on SaaS technology is developing faster, becoming more competitive.  And this is probably the main advantage of working under the SaaS scheme. <br><br>  As a rule, all these pros and cons are similar in other areas of business products, like CRM, ERP, Marketing Tools, Project Manager and others. <br><br>  Our products can be found below: <br>  <a href="http://imagecms.net/">CMS platform</a> and <a href="http://premmerce.ru/">SaaS platform</a> <br><br>  <i>What advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to using or developing software did you come across?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293474/</a></p>
