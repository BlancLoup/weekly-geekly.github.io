If you ask Starbucks, you will be told that the mobile and digital world is a great gift in the context of focusing on exceptional leadership.  Last year, the company said it had reshuffled its management specifically in order to release CEO Howard Schulz so that he could focus on integrating with digital technologies as a primary task. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  While Starbucks calls mobile advertising a key component of a large digital strategy, you can argue with whether mobile advertising is really important to make it the only component of the strategy.  In fact, many analysts recommend doing this, stating that mobile advertising is the first, if not the only thing that the company's digital presence should focus on.

      What makes a mobile so meaningful?  Most analysts cite such reasons as a great consumer experience.  And, moreover, this is the main way in which many people perceive the world today - where they get news from, where they communicate with families and friends.  This becomes the only way they receive information about your company, and this is the means through which your company can recognize a consumer based on the information you received from interacting with the phone. <br><br>  <b>Think strategically.</b> <br><br>  The next question you should ask yourself is what should be your mobile strategy?  And it all comes down to two things: applications or advertising.  Are you going to invest in a mobile application through which customers will communicate with you, or do you intend to invest in mobile marketing and advertising, which your business must demonstrate to customers?  Or do you choose both options at once?  If so, will you split the budget into equal parts?  Or which one give a little more? <br><br>  These are all important questions for any company, and especially for start-ups or small companies with their limited budgets for mobile presence.  And your answers will depend on your company and its goals.  This is not to say definitely which way to go, but you can highlight the attractive sides of both options, and this will help you make an informed decision. <br><br>  <b>Advertising creates awareness and pushes for action.</b> <br><br>  Mobile advertising is growing at an incredibly fast pace so that it is hard to believe that Nielsen began to conduct media measurements in this area only in 2013.  Since then, according to the eMarketer report, mobile advertising takes up more than half of the cost of digital advertising in 2015. <br><br>  Based on this, you might think that mobile advertising is definitely the way to profitable costs.  If your goal is to improve the parameters, such as the intention to buy or the desire to recommend you, you are right.  According to a comScore survey, mobile advertising is 4 times or more ahead of the desktop in these categories.  The indicators are also twice as high in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a positive attitude and almost three times as high as the induced recognition. <br><br>  <b>Applications increase customer loyalty and give a unique experience.</b> <br><br>  Mobile advertising is growing rapidly, but many companies today focus their attention on digital technology more than on digital advertising.  According to the head of Starbucks, applications increase the revenue of companies, because they provide a short and fast way to purchase goods.  E-commerce is a field in which mobile applications can prove themselves.  Moreover, many applications are fascinating and useful, and therefore create a high customer loyalty.  In addition, applications are a great source of customer information.  They can transmit information about where the consumer is at a particular point in time. <br><br>  So what to choose? <br><br>  Although the focus of your mobile costs depends on the goals of the organization, for most startups and small companies, a combination of the two methods could be an excellent option.  Think about what you want to achieve and make the appropriate decisions. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295662/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295662/</a></p>
