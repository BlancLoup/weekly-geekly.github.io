Rosnano is negotiating to participate in the Rusnano Ventures Fund II with international investors from the United States, Europe and Asia, <a href="http://www.finmarket.ru/news/4180659">writes</a> Finmarket. <br><br>  In October, the Board of Directors of Rosnano approved the creation of a Rusnano Ventures Fund I, LP venture fund and a general partner (management company) of Rusnano Ventures Fund I GP, LLC.  It is assumed that Rosnano design companies, which operate in North America, will be collected in the fund.  The fund will be up to $ 235 million. <br><br>  ‚ÄúVenture fund is a business based on trust and using previous experience.  External investors need to be shown that we can work in the structure of the fund: here is the fund, here are the companies, here is the management company.  The fund that we create is restructuring, during which we create a structure that is understandable to external investors, companies, regulators, ‚Äùexplains President Rusnano USA Dmitry Akhanov. <a name="habracut"></a>

      According to Rosnano, two new funds will have to invest in companies working with the so-called material technologies: optoelectronics, new materials, biotechnologies and new things at the interface of hardware and software.  "That is, we will not invest in projects related to the Internet or e-commerce," said Dmitry Akhanov. <br><br>  At the end of 2010, Rosnano created a subsidiary company Rusnano USA, Inc., which was supposed to represent the interests of Rosnano and its design companies in the United States and Canada, as well as assist in promoting Russian nanotechnology products to world markets.  Rusnano USA also provides assistance to the programs of the Fund for Infrastructure Educational Programs Rosnano in the United States and Canada. <br><br>  According to Akhanov, problems with attracting foreign investors due to the foreign policy situation are not expected: ‚ÄúWe are doing business.  If we talk about the average level, then people adequately assess the risks, the volume of their investments and the amount of benefits that we can receive.  They (investors) think not with emotions, but with quite calculated things, and if they have confidence in the profitability of opening an R &amp; D unit in Russia, then they will open it.  Especially now, when engineers and developers of comparable qualifications in Russia are cheaper than anywhere else. ‚Äù <br><br>  Last year, Rosnano approved a new strategy for 2014‚Äì2020.  In accordance with the new strategy, the task of Rosnano is to create investment funds of the following types: funds at the growth stage, venture funds under the direct control of the UK Rosnano and funds under self-government.  During this period, the company plans to invest about 63 billion rubles in new funds and attract third-party investments in the amount of 150 billion rubles. <br><br>  This is what Anatoly Chubais, the head of Rosnano, said in his <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20770/">interview</a> in this <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20770/">interview</a> : <br><blockquote>  We are on such an important transition, on which this proportion will change.  Its essence is as follows: until recently, we invested directly from the balance in projects with partners.  Of course, 80% of partners are Russian partners, I think that 20% are foreign partners, not more.  At the same time, respectively, 20% of our businesses are located abroad, in Silicon Valley, including, in Korea, in China and other countries. <br><br>  About a year and a half ago, we adopted a new strategy, within the framework of which we will act only and above all through investment funds.  We will create investment funds or, in classical world terminology, private equity funds.  Creating these private equity funds, we start with the proportions of 50 to 50, that is, 50% of our money, rosanovsky, 50% - not our money.  Actually, the first funds have already been created. </blockquote><br>  OJSC Rosnano is a Russian company established in 2007 for the development of nanotechnology.  Headquarters is located in Moscow.  The company invests in private projects to create new nanotechnology production. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297262/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297262/</a></p>
