No matter how much we write ‚Äúwe are looking for a programmer,‚Äù programmers no longer become.  How try to "lure" to the work of a typical programmer, ordinary recruiters? <br><br><h5>  Typical advertisement: </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffc/c59/cfd/ffcc59cfdab587e2bb67788d07dc1bcf.png"><br><br>  It sounds almost like an ad from the anecdote "We need workers for work at work, payment in money." <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      To which of the questions a potentially interested person answers this announcement? <br><ol><li>  What project is invited to? </li><li>  What technology stack? </li><li>  In what city? </li><li>  What are the work conditions? </li><li>  What salary? </li></ol><br>  What does a typical programmer think when he reads the name of the Yandex company?  Big company - big bureaucracy.  Minus one ball.  The local company is Russian management.  Another minus ball. <br><br><h5>  Typical job description: </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/264/da3/6c3/264da36c31de26627714f1c5e8e46b45.png"><br>  Imagine that you are reading an ad on a dating site: <br>  <i>Recently, I decided to start a girl who will surpass all previous ones.</i>  <i>I really need her, so I am casting.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>What will you do:</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>Cook three times a day, clean, wash, go shopping, bring beer.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The main (but not the only) area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility is to keep an eye on the house.</i>  <i>Keywords: Kitchen, Children, Church.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Required experience:</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>Culinary experience from 2 years.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Good knowledge of the Kama Sutra.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Loyalty and understanding that men are polygamous.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Understanding of male psychology.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Experience in housework.</i> <br><br>  The question immediately arises - who will lead to this?  No, well, if all the announcements are like this, then there could be more.  But candidates are unlikely to line up after seeing this. <br><br><h5>  Typical project description: </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d2/a59/56f/8d2a5956f0ceaf8edeb4cac98cf1682a.png"><br>  God, thank you.  Yes, this is a project of my dreams!  - people will never cry when they read this.  If you read it, of course. <br><br><h5>  Typical recruitment letter: </h5><br>  <i>Hello, I am an EMAP recruiter, we need employees in a banking project, the essence is this ... An employee who is needed can be a tester, java programmer or manager.</i>  <i>If you can test, then in the room you will have terminations to test remotely, programmers then commit bugs, and you test them.</i>  <i>If testing, then QA Automation should be.</i>  <i>You can actively use scrum.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And rallies are such that every morning but it can be from home if you want or sick there.</i>  <i>You can free schedule or 20% of the time as in Google.</i>  <i>Both JIRA and TDD are all used.</i>  <i>If you are a programmer, then you need to do as a tmlid, and before the release all are required and the customer who comes in must be heard as he says.</i>  <i>But scrum is necessary.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Well, if you as a manager ... then testers and programmers need to be built, they do what they want, and not that they feed.</i>  <i>or you can make their weekends work if needed.</i>  <i>We have 4 projects in total.</i>  <i>Those.</i>  <i>the first project is the frontend (jQuery is required and HTML5 is there), the second is the server (where is the base), but Oracle is there, the 3-project is an integration with third-party communications (but there is SOAP, REST, API are different), 4 is a release that must be released every month (as the customer wants)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If the tester works a lot, then it is necessary for him to team up in front of everyone and a gift so that he will be happy, and if it is bad so that he will not be happy and work more.</i>  <i>Also, programmers should work well, even if there is no bug, test it yourself or teach others, but if they don‚Äôt do anything to drive out for a long time or let them do other work, or the best thing is ... hire a team leader to teach and work.</i>  <i>Well if you timlid, timblid is very necessary.</i>  <i>Sportaz pay and bonuses.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Business trips are still there ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We are year old looking for someone like you.</i> <br><br><br><h4>  And what is wrong? </h4><br>  It's the economy, stupid (c) Bill Clinton <br><br><h5>  The basics of a market economy: </h5><br>  Entering the market, we find ourselves in the position of either the buyer or the seller and the labor market is no exception.  If demand exceeds supply, then sellers set the tone for the market.  And when supply exceeds demand - buyers. <br><br><h5>  The basics of a market economy for recruiters: </h5><br>  If there are fewer vacancies than offers, then potential employees compete with each other for a vacancy, seeking to please, and the employer selects the one who suits him best. <br><br>  If there are fewer candidates than vacancies, then employers are already competing for potential employees, and they choose the best offer. <br><br>  The demand for good programmers is higher than their number, so programmers set the tone in this market.  And the task of the recruiter is to interest the programmer so much that he comes to an interview. <br><br>  <b>The task of the recruiter is to interest a potential employee, and not to roll out a set of his requirements.</b> <br><br><h5>  So do not: </h5><br>  Comrades recruiters, do not write about what you want.  This is not interesting to anyone.  Example: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b3/904/56b/0b390456b2bc300a230b48e12eff024f.png"><br><br><br><h4>  And what to do? </h4><br>  ‚ÄúI love strawberries with cream, fish like a worm.  When I go fishing I do not take strawberries with cream with me, but take a worm. ‚Äù  Dale Carnegie. <br><br>  Think not of yourself, but of the person you are looking for.  Interested in a potential client.  Tell him about all the benefits he will get by agreeing to your offer.  And already after / if a person becomes interested, tell him about what he must do for this.  For example, send you a detailed resume. <br><br>  <b>These are not the requirements of the snickering programmer, but the foundations of a market economy.</b> <br><br>  If you want to interest a person with your offer, then why do you start a conversation with what you want from him?  Offer him what he wants.  Here are the things that most likely will interest an experienced programmer who knows his own worth: <br><ol><li>  Interesting project </li><li>  Work not far from home </li><li>  Large and spacious office </li><li>  Friendly team </li><li>  Worthy cash compensation </li><li>  Business trips abroad at the expense of the company </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Interesting project </h5><br>  Take into account that you cannot offer a potential employee an abstract ‚Äúinteresting project‚Äù and ‚Äúfriendly team‚Äù.  After all, people are different: what will be interesting to one will not be interesting to another.  If a person is interested in Hadoop, he may not be interested in HTML5. <br><br>  It is best to give a complete description of the project in the hope of interest in the person.  The more people read such a description, the greater the chance that someone will be interested.  (See <a href="http://www.cossa.ru/articles/234/2494/">Sales Funnel</a> ) <br><br>  The friendly team is also concerned.  If I am told about a friendly team, this does not mean that we will have common interests and / or they will become my friends.  Pushkin also had friends, but I am not sure that we would have found a common language with him. <br><br>  It is better to write that one of the potential colleagues are interested in rafting, two three times a year go skiing, and the rest are going to eat at the office every Friday for pizza and drink beer with a guitar. <br><br><h5>  It is pleasant to listen to a clever person, and you can talk with a stupid one </h5><br>  Good programmers need everyone.  Therefore, they rarely sit without work and are waiting for your proposal.  They just have nothing to do, how to spend half a day and go through the whole city, so that you tell them about your wishes. <br><br>  Suppose such a person posted a resume on the Internet.  In the first week he received 10-20 offers.  And yours among them.  Here is how the analysis of such proposals: <br><br>  - These even did not indicate the city.  Nafig <br>  - These immediately offer a test task.  Just a day.  Yeah, I have nothing more to do. <br>  - Description of the project on two sheets.  Well, who will read more paragraph pairs? <br>  - And there is only one line.  M-yes.  Informative, nothing can be said. <br>  - A young and fast-growing company.  Oh my God!  One time was enough.  Delete. <br>  - Oh, and here Vasya works for me.  I will write to him - let him tell what the project is. <br>  - But these even fork wages are not indicated.  Do not want to say and do not.  Delete. <br><br>  Recruiters!  If you write in a vacancy only about what you need from the candidate, and if he is potentially interested in it - do not write anything, then write at least a salary.  To list the duties and not to specify the amount of compensation is very stupid, do you not find? <br><br><h5>  An offer you cannot refuse. </h5><br>  Programmers, it would be nice to read something like that in the project description, right? <br>  <i>We do not want to publicly talk about our project, but it is very promising.</i>  <i>Let our recruiter come to you at a convenient time for you to talk freely, tell about our company and answer all your questions.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We understand that we are wasting your personal time.</i>  <i>How about meeting him for lunch or dinner.</i>  <i>(which our company pays as a mark of respect, as compensation for your time).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Also, if you have the opportunity and desire, you can come to our office, and the person who leads the project will tell you about it.</i> <br><br><h5>  Bonus </h5><br>  Another tip.  You offer a person to resign from a company where he already has acquaintances and friends.  Changing jobs is always stressful.  Think about how you can smooth out this negative point. <br>  <i>We understand that a job change is a serious step and thank you.</i>  <i>Therefore, we are ready to provide you with a bonus of your choice:</i> <i><br></i> <ol><li>  <i>gigabit internet</i> </li><li>  <i>server for your pet-project</i> </li><li>  <i>private office</i> </li><li>  <i>a trip to any IT conference in the world</i> </li><li>  <i>private secretary</i> </li><li>  <i>modest cash compensation</i> </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Mutual respect </h5><br>  Talk about what excites a person. <br>  <i>Our company really appreciates when you donate personal time for work.</i>  <i>And although overtime is paid only after coordination with the company's management, but if you stay at work for more than two hours, you can take a taxi home at the company's expense.</i> <br><br><h5>  Ideal workplace </h5><br>  You will not believe it, but most good programmers like to work.  Otherwise they would not have reached such heights in this matter.  Therefore, most of them are looking for a place where they would be nice and comfortable to work a lot. <br><br>  <b>Offer programmers the ideal working environment, and they will come to you.</b> <br><br>  Most often it is a large and spacious office, where each person has about 10 meters of his personal space.  Those.  a separate cabinet or a cube measuring 3 meters by 3 meters. <br><br>  Programmers love to work in silence.  If there are more than 8 people sitting in one room, then when the 2nd people are talking, another 6 are distracted.  This is 3 times more than if there were 4 people in the room. <br><br>  A person who speaks loudly on the phone on the phone distracts 20 more people from work.  Moreover, these 20 fall out of the stream for at least an hour.  Those.  one call - minus 20 man-hours.  Not to mention the nerves of people. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0db/a38/b8d/0dba38b8d5d8d4dfc3255d261c5e0006.png"><br><br>  No need for these huge meeting rooms.  Official meetings are very rarely needed - it is impossible to solve anything on them, the maximum is to report on the work.  And the most important decisions are made as a result of constant discussions in an informal atmosphere. Small rooms are needed for communication with drawing boards.  And, perhaps, with tea and cookies, so that people go there often. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213503/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213503/</a></p>
