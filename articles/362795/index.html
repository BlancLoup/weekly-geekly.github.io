  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fighting a problem in a laptop, or why big companies allow themselves such bugs?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello readers.  I would like to share one story with a strange happy ending. <br><br>  Let's get down to business.  In November 2013, I purchased a laptop from a well-known company - Apple.  Namely Macbook Pro Retina Early 2013 ME664.  At first, everything was fine, and then, after two months, it just hung.  "Freeze" I thought, with what does not happen?  Windows can be, and the Mac axis can not?  He pressed his turn and made a reboot.  Then there was a couple of these with an interval of 2-3 weeks.  But since they happened during the working time, I just did a reboot and continued to do business, forgetting about the problem. <br><br>  One evening it happened again, and I decided to figure it out, since I was not happy that a laptop for 2,000 bucks allows itself this, although, okay, what lies, it just pulls me into "dancing with a tambourine."  Armed with a console, I began to look for reasons and ponder why? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      For a start, I determined for myself that there is no regularity at all, there is no specific application, or an action template that could lead to a complete freeze of everything.  He could hang in a day, and he could once in two weeks.  Searches for errors in the console did not give anything.  Standard log - everything is OK, until it suddenly stops and then a new launch of the machine.  Possible switching on / off of some functions, peripherals, did not lead to anything. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Then I decided to reinstall the system.  And then I realized that the laptop just challenges me, as it did not help.  And the natural first thought that the dead friezes on a fresh system is a sign to dig in the direction of iron.  D at startup and AHT (Apple Hardware Test) did not find anything.  Testing with ASD (Apple Service Diagnostic) was even better. <br><br>  Okay, with iron "OK".  You can return to the system.  Started digging software, maybe something crashes?  I went through a lot and deleted it, in the end I came to the conclusion that it hangs even on a clean system.  All this time, at the same time Google loaded various questions on the topic and tried various solutions - everything did not bring results. <br><br>  Do not know what to do?  Go to the Apple Store, there is still a guarantee, let the local ‚ÄúGeniuses‚Äù search.  The first trip ended in nothing, during the week of testing, they never hung on them, but it was impossible to demonstrate this bug, one word - random. <br><br>  So much so that he tried using dtrace to track all the actions of the file system.  Hoping to find something that paints him.  But to no avail, Google has already threatened to ban me if I do not cease to google on the same topic.  In the end, I went to the Apple Store a second time.  They did not find any problems again, but they replaced the motherboard, which includes i7 8gb 650m, with a price of 600 euros.  The next day he hung up again. <br><br>  My last idea was to try installing OSes other than OS X Mavericks - 10.8 and 10.10 beta did not bring any results.  But the Windows from under the bootcamp is surprisingly not hung.  Although I used it a little, because of dislike.  I have marked this small trifle in my head.  But it was OS X that interested me. <br><br>  The third trip to the Apple Store.  I wait for the moment when he hangs and bring them to them the next day.  To show the "product face."  The genius from the bar immediately notes this bug and, on the basis of the fact that I come for the third time, promises to change the SSD.  The next day I take it with a new SSD for another 400 euros.  Surprisingly, they serve customers well and quickly.  And I get in 2 days hang.  Now I understand that this is only my problem and only a miracle will help me. <br><br>  Miracle!  Probably, on page 50 of Google‚Äôs issue, I find a message on a completely different problem with the MacBook, probably 2007-2009.  There, a person is advised to turn off one tick in the "Energy Saving" settings.  And it is called "if possible to transfer disks to sleep."  Enabled by default when installing the system. <br><br>  Who would we think?  After it was turned off, there was not a single freeze.  I was just wondering how simple the solution was.  And what I did before that. <br><br>  In the end, I did not understand why such a large company allows this?  Why don't the geniuses at Apple know anything about this?  For me, these answers remained a mystery. <br><br>  I hope someone can help this method in possible problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362795/</a></p>
