Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Key features of CorelCAD 2014 </h4><br>  CorelCAD 2014 helps you work more productively with built-in support for .DWG files, industry-standard CAD features, customizable 2D and 3D design tools, and compatibility with various formats.  CorelCAD is optimized for both Windows and Mac OS and is notable for impressive speed, performance and adaptability on any of the platforms. <br><br><h5>  Opening and saving .DWG files </h5><br>  All CAD solutions allow you to work with AutoCAD .DWG files, but many of them have their own formats.  When converting such files to the .DWG format and vice versa, important parts of the drawing may be lost or distorted.  And some CAD applications are not able to open third-party proprietary file formats.  In CorelCAD 2014, .DWG is used as the main format of drawings, which eliminates the problems of working together. <br>  Many CAD solutions and their proprietary file formats contain elements that are not supported in the .DWG format.  Conversely, AutoCAD has features that are not supported by some applications, which can cause unwanted and untimely difficulties during file conversion.  CorelCAD 2014 processes file attributes related to unsupported AutoCAD features, ensuring full compatibility while working with partners and customers using the .DWG file format. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  CorelCAD solution is compatible with any files created in AutoCAD version from R12 to 2013 .DWG.  The ability to save drawings in the widely-used .DWG and DXF formats of version R12 allows you to continue to use outdated equipment (for example, a laser engraving device or a plotter) that recognizes only this version.  In addition, CorelCAD can be used to repair damaged .DWG and DXF files of any version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b5/868/60d/1b586860df1a564fe74982abf9d1a9dc.gif">

In complex designs, the transparency of a layer can be applied to highlight certain content or to make the content under the current layer visible. <br>  <b>Align Viewport tool:</b> The Align Viewport command greatly simplifies the layout of drawing elements and provides more accurate alignment in sheets.  In CorelCAD 2014, viewports are aligned according to the internal geometry of the screen.  You no longer have to rely on guesswork when determining the exact location of drawing elements. <br>  <b>PDF Base:</b> External PDF files can be used as PDF bases in a drawing.  You can specify the visibility parameters of the PDF base layer, crop the PDF base so that only the necessary part of it is displayed, and also detach the bases from the current drawing.  CorelCAD 2014 also supports Microstation DGN files as bases. <br>  <b>Direct text editing:</b> CorelCAD 2014 allows you to make changes to text directly on the screen, instead of using a separate dialog box.  The tool for direct text editing allows you to modify component definitions (block definitions) or elements (reference drawings).  Changes to the drawing specification are displayed in real time.  <b>Team ExplodeX:</b> This command converts ellipses and splines into polylines.  It is especially useful when exporting drawings to other applications or devices that do not support ellipses and splines, such as outdated engraving machines.  You can also use the ‚ÄúExplode‚Äù command to break down such complex objects as blocks into components. <br><br><h5>  Design in two-and three-dimensional modes </h5><br>  In addition to the full set of features for two-dimensional design, CorelCAD 2014 includes a number of tools for modeling three-dimensional objects. <br>  <b>Tools for modeling three-dimensional objects:</b> With the tools of three-dimensional modeling, CorelCAD 2014 provides the ability to work in three-dimensional mode, which is becoming more common.  As in three-dimensional CAD systems, you can add elementary three-dimensional shapes to a project and use Boolean operations to combine, intersect, and subtract bodies.  Two-dimensional objects can be drawn, rotated or moved along the path.  You can create three-dimensional objects on the basis of sections of two-dimensional objects.  In addition, CorelCAD 2014 allows users to perform intersection and division into sectors with three-dimensional shapes, as well as change their edges, faces and bodies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f15/846/5c6/f158465c61e63e31a6ba537525fa8d93.gif"><br><br>  <b>Try it!</b> <br>  <b>3D design</b> <br>  1 Select <b>File - New</b> from the menu, select a standard template and click the <b>Open</b> button. <br>  2 At the command prompt, enter <b>Sphere</b> . <br>  3 Click in the graphics area to set the center point and drag the pointer to set the radius. <br>  4 Select <b>View - Tile View Manager</b> from the menu <b>.</b> <br>  5 In the <b>Mosaic Views</b> dialog box <b>,</b> select <b>New</b> and click <b>3M</b> in the <b>Orientation</b> drop-down list. <br>  6 Select <b>Four: Left</b> in the Default <b>Configurations</b> list and click <b>OK</b> . <br>  7 Click the <b>Rectangle</b> tool in the toolbar and draw a rectangle. <br>  8 With the rectangle selected, on the menu, select <b>Solids - Draw - Eject</b> and drag in the drawing window. <br>  9 With the rectangle and sphere <b>selected</b> , choose <b>View - Shade</b> . <br>  <b>Cloud</b> Editing tool <b>:</b> In CorelCAD 2014, you can create edit clouds for drawing various explanatory notes and notes to the elements of a drawing, which simplifies the editing process and review.  Editing clouds can be of various shapes: rectangular, oval or arbitrary.  In addition, you can set certain parameters for the cloud: color, line style and thickness, cloud layer, and the radius of the arc segments. <br><br><h6>  High performance in both Windows and Mac OS </h6><br>  CorelCAD 2014 allows you to quickly and efficiently work on both the Windows operating system and Mac OS. <br>  <b>Freedom to choose an operating system:</b> CAD applications have almost always been designed to work on Windows operating systems, but CorelCAD changes this tradition.  No matter which operating system Mac or Windows the user prefers, CorelCAD will allow him to work quickly and efficiently.  And although the capabilities of some CAD systems for Mac OS are limited compared to their equivalent for Windows, CorelCAD provides Windows and Mac users with almost the same level of functionality (all functions apply to both operating systems, unless otherwise noted).  Comparison of the functionality of the application in Windows and Macintosh operating systems is given in Comparing CorelCAD 2014 for Windows and Mac OS on page 15. <br>  <b>Improved!</b>  <b>Support for Windows 8.1 and Mac OS Mavericks</b> : CorelCAD 2014 supports Windows 8 for PC.  Mac users can take advantage of new Mac OS X features, including full-screen display mode.  In addition, CorelCAD 2014 is optimized to work in high resolution mode, which ensures that clear, easily readable user interface elements are displayed on high resolution monitors. <br>  <b>Improved!</b>  <b>Built-in support for 64-bit systems:</b> For users of both Windows and Mac OS, CorelCAD 2014 offers a 64-bit CAD environment that provides efficient processing of large CAD files.  In addition, a 32-bit version is also included for Windows users who may need it to work on less powerful hardware. <br>  <b>Improved!</b>  <b>Application speed and performance:</b> CorelCAD 2014 64-bit architecture provides enhanced application speed on Windows and Mac OS platforms.  The application also provides accelerated image recovery, which contributes to smoother scaling and panning when working with large and complex CAD drawings. <br><br><h5>  Configure and automate to improve performance </h5><br>  To configure the interface CorelCAD 2014 does not need programming knowledge.  You can also automate task execution or add new functionality to the application. <br>  <b>Automation Support:</b> Users can increase their productivity by using the LISP programming interfaces and Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Applications (VSTA) * to automate repetitive tasks and create their own functions, routines, and plug-ins.  In addition, third-party add-ons and add-ons for CorelCAD from third-party developers can be purchased at the plug-in store *, allowing you to add new functionality to the application. <br>  <i>* Only in Windows version.</i> <br>  <b>Support for Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Applications (VSTA):</b> The ‚ÄúVSTA Manager‚Äù toolbar allows you to record, edit, and run VSTA macros.  For Windows users, CorelCAD 2014 offers built-in VSTA functions that enable you to automate the execution of routine tasks and repetitive commands.  In addition, integration with the VSTA development environment offers additional functions for creating complex macros. <br>  <b>Improved!</b>  <b>LISP support:</b> CorelCAD 2014 now offers support for icon menus when working with LISP procedures.  This allows you to create custom dialog boxes that display thumbnails (SLDs) of CAD components.  This is especially useful when creating custom libraries.  In addition, CorelCAD 2014 adheres to a common LISP programming framework, which makes it easy to reuse existing procedures without recompiling. <br>  <b>Improved!</b>  <b>User Interface Customization:</b> Each industry where CAD systems are used has its own workflow.  Therefore, CorelCAD 2014 is easily customized to meet the needs of various sectors and projects.  Without any knowledge of programming, you can customize the user interface to suit specific tasks.  Custom workspace configurations can then be saved in user profiles and implemented across the organization.  This allows the user interface to be tailored to specific projects and ensures maximum productivity.  In addition, you can now import CUIX files, which facilitates the transition for those AutoCAD users who work with custom workspaces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce1/552/e5f/ce1552e5f50c6979039634189ce79ac8.gif"><br><br>  <b>Ordered layouts:</b> CorelCAD allows you to arrange drawings using multiple tile layouts using tabbed sheets.  For each sheet, you can define a separate style of printing or drawing.  The drawing window can be divided into several types, in which the drawing will be presented in different perspectives.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can put drawing frames, stamps, specifications and other information on the sheets. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Double-clicking the mouse button allows you to switch between model space and paper space to customize the presentation of the model or to change it.</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Compatible, streamlined workflow </font></font><br></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">CorelCAD 2014 makes it easy to collaborate and share data with colleagues and customers thanks to the support of many standard industry formats. </font></font><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Access sketches and drawings from CorelDRAW *:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Many designers prefer to use graphic applications to create sketches, and then begin to develop accurate CAD drawings and two- and three-dimensional models. In CorelCAD 2014 for Windows, you can import CorelDRAW (CDR) and Corel DESIGNER (DES) files in the model space object format with a layout sheet view. You can work with multi-page CDR files (from version 8 to release X6) and DES files (from version 10 to release X6). </font></font><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Publish to CorelDRAW and Corel DESIGNER *:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">CAD files are used not only in the design departments, but the inclusion of such files in other enterprise workflows has always been a difficult task. Graphics professionals working in other departments of the company regularly have to deal with CAD files, because the contents of these files are often ideal for presentations, technical documentation or marketing materials. CorelCAD 2014 makes it easy to use CAD files for other purposes: thanks to the ability to export to CorelDRAW and Corel DESIGNER *, you can quickly open and reuse these files. </font></font><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Convenient file sharing:</font></font></b> CorelCAD 2014             ,    SVG, ACIS SAT  DWF.
