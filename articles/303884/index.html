And in this post we will analyze what can be offered to the distinguished Jack Ma as a solution to the current situation.  Errors can and should be somehow corrected.  Let's take a look at and find a solution to the "main mistake of life" of Jack Ma! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>General conditions of the problem:</b> <br>  Alibaba has become the largest e-commerce platform in China (in all three segments: b2c, b2b, c2c).  Alibaba AliExpress's subsidiary project in Russia has become the largest e-commerce product already in Russia, followed by e-bay with a margin, then Ozon ... The company has enough money and responsibility.

      Jack Ma said that having such a responsibility and such a big business, big capital, he bears a huge responsibility and has to devote all his time to the work of the company to ensure its quality development. <br><br>  There is a trend.  Recently, in March, a similar statement was made by the founder of Russia's largest street retail grid, Magnit, Sergei Galitsky.  He said that "he was tired of work and would prefer to play football if he could quit business" and "Nowhere to go, I don‚Äôt see who could be given away."  Successful businessmen who have achieved absolute leadership in their subject languish from routine. <br><br>  When I heard Jack Ma's statement, I had an idea how these two talented entrepreneurs could solve their personal issues beautifully, at the same time increasing the quality of development of their own businesses, and opening up opportunities for the development of entrepreneurial communities, both in China and in Russia.  And not only in e-commerce or retail ... <br><br>  <b>Ma quotes (consider additional criteria and conditions for solving a case):</b> <br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúMy biggest mistake is that I created Alibaba.  I did not think that this would change my life, I just tried to create a small company.  However, this company has become so large, ‚Äùhe said. </li><li>  According to Ma, because of his work, he has ‚Äúno life.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI want to live on my own, I want to enjoy my life,‚Äù the company founder lamented. </li><li>  ‚ÄúAnd if I have the next life, I will never engage in such a business &lt;...&gt; I want to be able to go to any country in the world and spend quiet time there.  I don‚Äôt want to talk about business, I don‚Äôt want to work, ‚ÄùMa concluded. </li><li>  At the same time, the founder of Alibaba called the creation of an ‚Äúelectronic corridor that will support all enterprises in the world‚Äù as their main dream. </li></ul><br>  <b>Solution of the problem: what could Jack Ma do?</b> <br>  1) Establishing a <b>trust or holding ‚ÄúAlibaba Holding‚Äù</b> , which will control Alibaba, will transfer all of it, Jack Ma, approaches and values, but will be institutionalized and will not depend on one person, his time, energy or mood. <br>  2) Alibaba needs to establish <b>Alibaba Ventures investment fund</b> , which will invest in technology companies in China, Russia, and the world.  Alibaba is the ideal investor for many Russian start-ups and IT companies: Habrahabr.ru (Alibaba could be a partner for entering the Chinese market), LinguaLeo (the Chinese market studying English is bigger than all the others combined), Promobot (China also needs robots, and they are produced in Russia) and so on ... <br>  3) To ensure the continuity of the organizational culture and the quality of professionalism of all personnel of the holding and companies, organize the <b>corporate university ‚ÄúAlibaba Academy‚Äù</b> and part of the trust and foundation money to invest in its creation and development, in the training of all the specialists of his company in their professions. <br><br>  <b>What is the use of this approach to correcting the main mistake in Ma's life?</b> <br><ul><li>  Alibaba grows further efficiently and on the same principles </li><li>  Ma is free and can spend time for herself, family, grandchildren </li><li>  Ma personally and Alibaba will start investing in the development of communities, in training for professions that are needed as an environment for Alibaba itself to grow and companies like it appear </li><li>  Alibaba's capital will invest through the fund in new technology companies in China, Russia and around the world </li><li>  Ma and Alibaba‚Äôs investments in Russian companies are very profitable for everyone: they are currently not highly valued, while their technological and engineering potential is high, Ma and Alibaba can help them enter the Chinese market, where there are no such products, Ma‚Äôs investments can help these companies become on international projects (to enter not only China and the markets of Southeast Asia, but also in Europe, the markets of North and South America, and other markets). </li></ul><br>  So, Ma and, by analogy, Galitsky could create a trust to manage their companies, and a venture fund that would invest in projects of technological entrepreneurs.  Galitsky, you can create a holding, train employees to level out the ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù, of which there is a lot of food retail, automate everything automated, and then enjoy your football! <br><br>  <b>What can you add to what has been said?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303884/</a></p>
