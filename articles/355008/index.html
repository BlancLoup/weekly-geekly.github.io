      Let's talk on completely different topics, but not losing relevance: building a business-oriented development, staff onboarding and delegation.  We will also hold a panel discussion, during which we will raise one of the most, perhaps, exciting technical issues: what companies expect from the developer and how they conduct interviews. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://badoo-tech.timepad.ru/event/710313/">Register here.</a></b>  Please note that you need to wait for confirmation of participation.  The number of places in our cafe is limited, and we hope for your understanding!  We will also make an online broadcast. <br><br>  <b>Address:</b> Tsvetnoy Boulevard, 2 (m. Trubnaya) <br>  <b>Reports start</b> at 11:30 <br>  The broadcast will be on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/badoo_tech">YouTube channel</a> and in <a href="https://vk.com/badoodevs">VK</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BadooDevs/">FB</a> groups.  We will publish records in the same place and on Habr√©. <br><br><h1>  Program </h1><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4q/9a/th/4q9athvo3j5jrragrf4rp7hrkhu.jpeg" align="left" width="150"></p><h2>  ‚ÄúHow to build a business-oriented development.  Experience DomKlik " </h2><br>  <b>Alexey Kuzmin, Technical Director of the dwh- and data science teams</b> <br><br>  In DomKlik recently only developers and Product Owners have been working.  How can a team of almost 250 people live without requirements, testing and other familiar processes and tools?  It turned out quite convenient and easy. <br><br>  In his report, Alexey will talk about the advantages and nuances of such a device, such as: <br><br><ul><li>  short release cycle </li><li>  conveyor development.

You can ‚Äútake the handle‚Äù and lead a person through all the circles of adaptation, but what to do in a fast-growing team? <br>  I will tell you what steps to meet a newcomer should be done before starting work, on the first day and during the trial period, so that the adaptation is as painless as possible for both the business and the team.  I will share the principles that guided us when creating QuickStart - our tool for beginners - and I will focus on the unobvious, but important, nuances of onboarding. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sm/__/pd/sm__pdbd2rdeminh63xq1agjcpi.jpeg" align="left" width="150"><h2>  ‚ÄúDelegation as a tool for a manager‚Äù </h2><br>  <b>Ilya Ageev <a href="https://habr.com/users/uyga/" class="user_link">uyga</a> , Engineering Director QA (Badoo)</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn my report I will tell you what delegation is and what types of delegation are.  I will tell a couple of bearded fables (and one in general several times, but this will be in the subject) and mention such clever words as management theory, the concept of continuous improvement, kaizen, bass factor, neocortex, working maturity levels, situational management and others.  I will mention such smart people as Henri Fayolle, Henry Ford, Chester Bernard, William Deming, Robin Dunbar, Paul Hersey, Ken Blanchard and others.  I will give examples of incorrect delegation and, finally, I will try to tell you how to do it correctly. <br><br>  At the end of the report, I will talk about a very secret delegation know-how, about which no one can speak.
