Maybe you turn it off and continue to sleep? <br><br>  This was once part of my daily awakening ritual.  When the alarm started to make its terrible sound, I immediately turned it off.  Then I started to think slowly, should I get up or not: <br><br>  <em>Under the blanket is warm and good.</em>  <em>If I get up, it will be cold.</em>  <em>It is unpleasant.</em>

      <em>No, I really need to get up right now!</em>  <em>Come on, move your legs!</em> <br><br>  <em>I have to go do the exercises.</em>  <em>However, I don‚Äôt really want to work right now.</em>  <em>I didn't even have breakfast.</em>  <em>Maybe we should go for a snack first?</em> <br><br>  <em>I guess I get up too early.</em>  <em>I'm still sleepy.</em>  <em>Maybe getting up on an alarm clock is unnatural?</em>  <em>Maybe I will feel better if I sleep more?</em> <br><br>  <em>I don't have to get up right this minute.</em>  <em>I can rest another five minutes or a little longer.</em>  <em>If I don't get up right now, nothing will happen.</em> <br><br>  <em>Wife hates when I stick to her at 6 am, but so what?</em>  <em>She will forgive me for this.</em>  <em>I know.</em>  <em>I'll start massaging her back and shoulders.</em>  <em>She will not be able to resist a good massage, especially so early in the morning.</em>  <em>Then I will switch to the head.</em>  <em>And then we will have sex.</em>  <em>A cool way to start the day, isn't it?</em> <br><br>  Two hours later ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I: What time is it?  I already forgot that the alarm clock rang. <br><br>  Wife: Why put up so early if all the same you are not going to get up when he rings? <br><br>  Me: According to this alarm clock I was going to not get up :) <br><br>  Well, actually, I was going to get up exactly for this alarm clock, but my fogged brain persuaded me to go back to sleep. <br><br>  Quickly go to the present time ... <br><br>  Usually my alarm clock rings between 4:00 and 5:00 am ... but no later than 5:00, even on weekends and holidays.  I turn off the call after a few seconds.  With a deep breath I fill my lungs and sip for a couple of seconds.  My legs touch the floor and I start to dress.  I go downstairs, take the fruit and hide in the office to work with some letters, and then until 5:15 the exercise. <br><br>  But this time there is no voice in my head that decides what to do.  There is not even a positive voice - not at all.  Everything happens on autopilot, until consciousness wakes up completely.  I can not say that we need a special discipline to do this every morning.  It became a conditioned reflex.  When the alarm sounds, I react just like Pavlov‚Äôs dogs.  Much more difficult now I will not get up. <br><br>  And how to move from the first scenario to the second? <br><br>  First you need to understand that most people are trying to do it wrong. <br><br>  Do not expect willpower to help you get up early every morning.  It may work once, but look - you do not always clearly reflect when the alarm clock rings.  Decisions made in a fogged state will not always be the same as if you were awake.  You can't trust yourself here ... <br><br>  If you think otherwise, you will fall into the trap.  You decide to get up at one time, but then, when the alarm rings, you cancel your decision.  At ten in the evening you decide that it would be nice to wake up at 5 in the morning.  But at 5 am you decide that it is even better to wake up at 8 am  But admit - the evening decision is the only thing you wanted to perform ... <br><br>  Now some will decide that they lack discipline.  This is partly true, but not in the sense that you understood.  If you decide to get up at 5 am, you do not need more discipline at 5 am.  You do not need to be able to persuade yourself to get up.  And do not have two or three alarms, placed throughout the room - it's just silly.  And of course, no fancy alarm clock is needed. <br><br>  In fact, discipline is necessary in order to recognize that it is impossible to trust the mind to make a decision at the moment of awakening. <br><br>  You need to delegate this problem.  The whole process should be controlled by the subconscious mind, not the conscious mind. <br><br>  How to achieve this?  Just like you got used to any recurring event.  Train until it becomes a habit.  In the end, the subconscious will take over and the whole scenario will occur on autopilot. <br><br>  It sounds silly, but it works.  Practice getting up with an alarm clock.  But - not in the morning.  Do this during the day when you are awake. <br><br>  Go to the bedroom and create the conditions in which you would like to wake up.  Turn off the lights, shut up the windows or train in the evening after sunset, when it is already dark.  If you sleep in your pajamas, change into pajamas.  If you brush your teeth before bedtime, then brush your teeth.  If you remove contact lenses before bedtime, do it. <br><br>  Start the alarm a few minutes ahead.  Lie down in bed as if you are sleeping and close your eyes.  Take a comfortable position.  Imagine that it is early morning, just a few minutes before the time when you want to wake up.  Pretend you're really sleeping.  Think of a dream for yourself, or at least try to disconnect as much as possible. <br><br>  And when the alarm goes off, turn it off as quickly as possible.  Then take a deep breath and stretch for a couple of seconds.  Sit down, lower your legs to the floor and stand up.  Smile a wide smile.  And start doing what you do every morning.  Personally, I first get dressed. <br><br>  Then shake and regain your condition before getting up.  Go back to bed.  Reset the alarm and repeat.  Do it again and again until you can repeat the whole process on autopilot without thinking about it.  If your inner voice still tells you what to do next, continue to train. <br><br>  Think of it as an exercise in the gym.  You can do one or two sets a day, maybe 3-10 times. <br><br>  Of course, this takes time, but this time is nothing compared to what you keep in perspective.  A few hours of classes today will save you hundreds of hours throughout the year. <br><br>  With enough practice - I don‚Äôt know exactly how long it will take for you personally - you will have another physical reaction to the sound of the alarm.  With the sound of the alarm you will automatically get up without even thinking about it.  The longer you practice it, the stronger the habit will be.  In the end, it will be unpleasant for you not to get up when the alarm clock rings.  Feeling like dressing pants backwards. <br><br>  You can train mentally.  This is faster, but I think it is better to go through the whole process physically.  You may miss some details if you do it mentally, in which case the subconscious mind will not be able to sense the real process.  So if you want to train mentally, then at least do it for the first few real times. <br><br>  The more you train, the deeper this habit will go into your subconscious.  The alarm clock rings - immediately get up. <br><br>  When it becomes a habit, you no longer have to train during the day.  Just go through it once.  Even if you decide to change your lifestyle (for example, while on a vacation in a different time zone), it will be very easy for you to return to it. <br><br>  Having once established your desired awakening ritual, I recommend following it every day - 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  And the first 30 days set your alarm at the same time every day.  Once this becomes a habit, you can change the wake-up time or sometimes do not use the alarm clock. <br><br>  You will love it.  This is one of my most productive habits.  She saves me hundreds of hours a year.  This same habit turned out to be very valuable during my experiment on multi-phase sleep. <br><br>  Think about it - if you pour just 30 minutes a day, that‚Äôs more than 180 hours a year.  And if you pour 60 minutes a day, it's as much as 365 hours a year, which is equivalent to nine 40-hour work weeks.  This is a lot of time!  I do not know about you, but I can come up with more interesting things than to sleep longer than necessary. <br><br>  I want you to try this method.  I know these workouts seem silly, but what if it works?  What if you are sure that by setting the alarm for a specific time, you wake up no matter what?  There is no reason why you could not achieve this in the next few days. <br><br>  And if you want to learn to get up early, read these two articles: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.steve-pavlina.ru/articles/how-to-become-an-early-riser/">How to become a lark</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.steve-pavlina.ru/articles/how-to-become-an-early-riser-part-2/">How to become a morning person (part 2)</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31308/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31308/</a></p>
