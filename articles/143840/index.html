  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About the organization of the desktop, works and documents</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let's discuss the organization of icons on the desktop.  I want to say: "show me your desktop, and I will tell you how you work."  <b>I bring up the main idea: The desktop is proposed to be used to organize current work on documents.</b>  <b>What is on the table is conscious, in focus.</b>  <b>Therefore, it is important to have the structure of this focus and it is important to remove the unnecessary from the focus in time.</b> <br>  You can often observe the following behaviors when using the desktop: <ul><li>  fill the table with icons to the limit, periodically "delete unused" </li><li>  leave a basket and a beautiful picture on the table, remove everything from the table, clean the basket regularly </li><li>  place frequently used shortcuts and some working papers on the table </li></ul>  <b>UPD:</b> While in the comments wins the option of an unused table. <br>  All this is a standard variant, the only drawback is that the desktop does not help in organizing work.  It's about how to blame a cat for not bringing slippers.  But you could and bring !!!  It is enough to properly draw the track. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b5/b2b/a1c/8b5b2ba1c4d09554ecf2a5aeab1a75a8.jpg" alt="How to &amp; nbsp; Design and Create a &amp; nbsp; Clean, Organized Desktop"><br>  At first, I thought that I was a genius and would make millions on this idea, but then I decided to drive into the search engine "Organizing desktop wallpaper".  The imagined yacht and girls-fans have disappeared, but it became clear that, firstly, the desire is quite adequate, and secondly, there are already ready-made options to take and use.  Those.  at least slippers.  The picture above is taken from the article <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5864785/how-to-design-and-create-a-clean-organized-desktop">How to Design and Create a Clean, Organized Desktop</a> . <br>  Below is a list of articles and options found, and also I will tell you about my idea and the tasks that it must solve: <a name="habracut"></a><ol><li>  Facilitate document storage </li><li>  Help in the management of work </li><li>  Manage your desktop over time </li></ol>  The idea itself is simple and clear: the picture on the desktop should help to ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù locate labels and manage their life. <br>  Who knows how to draw - offer your options in the comments, I will add them to the article, otherwise the bear has come to my hands. <br><h2>  Overview of options of interest: </h2><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.labnol.org/software/desktop-icons-wallpaper/13321/">Organize your Desktop with a Simple Wallpaper</a> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf6/7ae/a4e/bf67aea4e5022b8e0e1b53b0a404e832.png"><br>  I also had the first idea to find a picture where the icons would fit organically.  Either the interior with shelves, or some kind of conveyor.  Steampunk  But the tasks are set stronger, so we are looking further. <br><h3>  <a href="http://antbag.com/how-to-use-your-desktop-and-boost-productivity/">How to Organize Your Desktop to Boost Productivity</a> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd1/370/eb1/fd1370eb10530df64b067563178d1466.jpg"><br>  This idea is simple and clear, but does not help in any way to solve the tasks set above.  There are many icons, the process of working on them is not supported at all. <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2011/06/give-your-desktop-a-productivity-boost-with-these-built-in-organisation-wallpapers/">Give Your Desktop A Productivity Boost With These Built-in Organization Wallpapers</a> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/742/739/f27/742739f27eabed6bf8e8628ece46d495.jpg"><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing the desktop as a tool for work, where objects do not just lie, but pass their way, is revealed.  The article has a few ready-made pictures.  There is a similar article with a similar organization in the form of tracks: <a href="http://www.shelterpop.com/2009/10/09/organize-your-desktop-no-not-that-one/">Organize Your Desktop - No, Not That One!</a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://theprofessionalorganizer.com/blog/organize-your-computer-desktop/">Organize your computer desktop</a> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/824/0d4/77c/8240d477ced6e3fa19aa63de4c590c78.jpg"><br>  This is the most aesthetically pleasing of the found and also contains its idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing work. <br>  True, in all these approaches I don‚Äôt like that you can still put a bunch of icons on the table. <br><h3>  About the cleanliness of the table </h3>  Somewhere in here it is necessary to insert the idea that in one of the practical systems of restoring order in affairs a very interesting way is suggested: <b>at the end of each working day you need to tidy up on the table (physical) and leave it clean</b> .  Do not rush to argue, think about how to do it: <ul><li>  Transfer small entries to a diary, organizer, etc. </li><li>  Documents to put in the correct storage location (Tray / folder "archive", "current project", "drafts", "English", etc.) </li><li>  Finish started on a piece of paper and throw it away. </li></ul>  The table must be clean and tidy.  And behind it - and consciousness.  Leaving home, you realize that things have been completed.  Try it, it works. <br>  The following consideration has two goals: the table should be the minimum necessary and the table should please the view.  Therefore, we will put on it a beautiful picture.  As they say now, to "reflect individuality." <br><h3>  Proposed concept </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/930/e7d/bc1/930e7dbc10e6607ca945d7dd95a702b4.jpg" alt="Scetch"><ul><li>  The desktop is used for quick access to key applications. </li><li>  Objects with which current work is conducted are placed on the desktop. </li><li>  Objects are moved across the table to different areas depending on the current state of work on them. </li><li>  Desktop is used to navigate long-term storage. </li><li>  On the desktop there is a picture that defines the designated places for documents and shortcuts. </li></ul>  A software service can be offered that automates the processing of objects on the table (auto-archiving of unused shortcuts, auto positioning, timing control, etc.) <br>  Below I will describe a specific desktop configuration and some rationale for these ideas.  However, it is absolutely clear that approaches can vary and be combined. <br>  So, the central part of the table is given under the picture.  To please the eye and did not allow to litter the table. <br><h3>  Launch shortcuts </h3>  On the left are the permanent program shortcuts.  In the upper left corner - Basket.  And then I will explain why.  If there are too many programs on the left, then firstly, consider whether they are really needed every day, and secondly, you can use two vertical columns of icons.  Our solution is scalable. <br><h3>  Working Papers Panel </h3> The top line is the most important.  She is constantly in front of her eyes, it is most convenient to use her for current work.  I offer the following structure: <br>  The left third is for temporary files, they are processed, printed, added, sent, copied where needed - and sent to the recycle bin.  That is why the basket is right there on the left of them. <br>  The average third is for the current documents that are currently being worked on.  Upon completion, they can be sent to the destination and move to the archive or to the trash. <br>  The right third is for documents that linger on the table for longer work. <br>  It seems to me that modern wide monitors are just enough for the optimal for consciousness number of current working documents (tasks).  But if there is a need, we can use two rows and above. <br><h3>  Document repository </h3>  On the right we will have a tool for organizing long-term storage.  Symmetrically from the Trash in the upper right corner - the folder "Archive" or "Warehouse".  Upon completion of the work on the document, everything that it is a pity to delete is sent there, but it is too lazy to classify.  Leave this job with built-in tag and content search tools.  I still rejoice every time I transfer another incomprehensible document from routine affairs to such an archive.  It is impossible to create a system for everything, especially if it is not very necessary.  An unstructured archive for junk, content indexing and searching is the easy way to free the table and the mind.  I am stepping on a song about the archive, because I want to say a lot, but not all at once. <br>  Next, the actual storage structuring tool.  You need to create a simple file storage system and place shortcuts to key points on this system.  That is, useful documents after processing are not in the general archive dump, but in the right place.  And the entry points to such places we place on the right in a row. <br><h3>  Dynamics of the movement of documents </h3>  Thus, we have the following dynamics: documents get to the top, are taken away to the basket to the left, to the archive to the right or to the permanent storage to the right and down.  The emergence of new objects on the table forces us to remove too much from the table.  Take it as a rule - do not have more than 5-9 current documents, which are under active work.  The rest must be completed, canceled, delegated, transferred to the future.  Yes, this is one of the ideas - a time machine for files.  After completing the work on the document, put it in the right place (green arrows in the figure above). <br>  I will write below about an example of the organization of such a repository, but for now a few words about the remaining space. <br>  TaskBar, logically completing the symmetric image, so I do not place labels below.  However, if we are talking about scaling, if we have two rows of labels on the left and on the top, then there are two rows on the right ‚Äî for example, for a column of constantly required documents ‚Äî instructions, diagrams, links to project folders, etc.  And there may be an additional row below.  For example, for games and entertainment. <br>  That's what happened with me: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f0/217/676/4f0217676bf20a6f319aa28e2f0a07f9.jpg" alt="Desktop sample">  Well, and in order not to get up twice, a couple of words about the structure of the document storage (My Documents folder).  We are talking about this here, because the right side of the table is reserved for navigating through the repository. <br><h3>  Storage structure </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b30/292/b7c/b30292b7c5b4a3de1965dd91a588ce8a.png" align="left" alt="Storage structure">  Mail - folder with the local cache of the mail program.  Does not need backup.  Rename to Cache. <br>  Music - a folder with music and video for work.  Rename to Media.  Does not need backup. <br>  Temp - folder for temporary objects when copying, etc. <br>  SkyDrive - a folder for all documents that are synchronized with the cloud and home computer. <br><br>  In SkyDrive are: <br>  Office - office documents (travel, instructions, orders, etc.) <br>  Personal - folder with personal files <br>  Work - folder with working files <br>  Photos, Pictures - pictures, pictures <br>  Public, Shared - folders available on the Internet for sharing via SkyDrive with other people. <br><br><br>  Further division does not make sense to describe in detail.  The working folder contains the archive of projects, current projects, presentations, etc.  The main thing - on the desktop there are shortcuts to the key points of this structure.  And to current active projects.  This allows you to effortlessly fold documents into folders for long-term storage.  Offer in the comments your own versions of organizing wallpapers and ideas for using them. <br>  PS Found an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/8917">old post on Habr√© on this topic</a> .  However, there again the whole table is littered with documents. <br>  UPD: Many recommend <a href="http://www.stardock.com/products/fences/">Fences</a> .  This thing is mentioned in the articles, but I wanted to discuss the desktop in its purest form.  Once again I want to emphasize the thought of the article: the table can not be used.  This is just one of the applications.  But since it is in ADDITION to version control, to cloud folders, to the structure of documents (all this can be seen in the article), then why not use the table as ANOTHER tool, since it is always at hand. <br></div>
