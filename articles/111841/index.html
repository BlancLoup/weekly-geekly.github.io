Letters began to come with a request to help the girl to collect blood.  Well, send it to everyone on the list.  Attached phone number.  I type it in the search.  I find a stack of messages, the text is the same, and the names are different.  And somewhere blood is required, where is the money for the operation.  In general, I decided to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  I visited the site, painted it, how I received the message, what phone number, the list of sites on which the ad hangs.  Yes, and forgot this thing, like that.  I wrote exclusively to say with a calm soul ‚ÄúThey simply do not want,‚Äù otherwise everyone says.  And he received a reply from which it follows that there seems to be no violation of the law.  All send money voluntarily, but the fact that there is no patient, sorry, think for yourself.  You personally did not send the money, so do not suffer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/60ecc860/68d935a0/d11f60b9/f46d9d68.jpg"><br><br>  A month later, one day, I discover that MySQL has fallen on my VPS server.  I look at the reason, it turns out the lack of resources.  Although earlier no more than 20%.  I reboot, look at what's the matter, and discover a large number of mail server processes.  Few people use my mail, so a large number of incoming mail to the domain in which 2 mailboxes informed me about spam.  I set up a domain, and send all letters without an existing addressee there.  After 3 days, 3000 letters from one domain.  I slow down the process, turn on the white sheet, the server begins to gradually move away.  I myself analyze letters, it turns out that spam is in Russian, they offer citizenship, certificates, one-day firms, a virtuoso with taxes, etc.  In general, for each letter you could have a case.  And stumble on advertising spam itself.  I am writing on icq.  They confirm that my domain is on the list.  Please delete, they report that in a week spam will stop going.  Turning off the white sheet, spam again threw.  Theoretically, if you contact them and order a batch of letters, they will tell you where to send the money, and it is easier to trace finances, especially to the employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. <br>  I am writing a letter to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, with a list of all the coordinates of the spammers, indicating the servers, who, where and how much.  Screwed a couple of letters. <br>  Servers are located in Germany, spam servers were located in 2 European countries.  The spammers themselves were in Moscow.  And I live in a small village with a population of about 8,000 located 3500 km from Moscow, and 70 km from the regional center.  Having written on the site, I was sure that the staff of Moscow would be engaged.  But our fairyland surprises every day. <br><br>  I get the answer:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/925e7a4d/5a414359/5315f751/25fa9ceb.jpg"><br><br>  Those.  they sent a letter to the Region for 3,500 km to solve problems with a spammer located in Moscow. <br>  They call me to talk.  Considering that I study in the city, it was not difficult for me to reach 70 km to the mysterious department ‚ÄúK‚Äù.  At first I was looking for a building, there were no signs on it.  But from the uniformed employees leaving the fence, I understood: ‚ÄúI go there‚Äù.  Then I saw people leaving the criminal appearance, and I realized that this is the entrance.  There was no plate there, roofing felts after repair, roofing felts there never were.  I called and met me at the entrance.  The department is behind a code lock, where the digits of the code are wiped.  The department was located deep enough in the building, without interfering with any other.  Next, a couple more doors and went into the office.  6-7 people huddled there, all in a pile of papers and with a smart look looked at the monitors.  Who did not have monitors, looked at the phone or paper.  And then the dialogue began (perhaps not exactly, it was a long time ago): <br><br>  - What (Name Patronymic), nothing to do?  Write anything. <br>  - Well, why is there nothing, the law is being violated, he said. <br>  - We do not have a law on spam! <br>  - Well, about advertising there. <br>  - Yes, but the punishment is not provided. <br><br>  In general, it was necessary to write a statement, the employee himself wrote, then I read and signed that my words were written correctly.  The usual practice, I am always too lazy to write.  Then the dialogue went according to the statement, where the impression was that either I don‚Äôt even catch up with the Internet devices, or they check me.  I will not discuss their knowledge. <br><br>  - What is the website hosting? <br>  - I'm hosting myself. <br>  - Like this? <br>  - Well, look, NS refers to my site. <br>  - How did you do it? <br>  - I rented a server in the Data Center.  (I thought to say VPS, but something was afraid) <br>  - Where are they physically located? <br>  - In Germany. <br>  - Why exactly there? <br>  ‚ÄúIt's cheaper there, and people work better.‚Äù  Quality. <br>  - Speak spam is coming ... <br>  - Yes, the server is choking.  And they get the money. <br>  - Like this? <br>  - For mailing pay from 4000 rubles. <br>  - Oh, nafig.  Want to say, I'm sending a letter, and I'm 4000? <br>  - No, you will send 10 000 letters and you 4000 rubles. <br>  - Oh, nafig.  Anyway. <br>  - How did you write in the appeal, do you think that the law on advertising is violated?  (here, of course, it was necessary to add that another law is being violated. Which interferes with the work of a computer. It seems to be written in it.) <br>  - Yes. <br>  - And indicated how you communicate with them ... <br>  - Yes. <br><br>  He copied from my appeal, and made a statement.  From the message I noticed that when sending from the site, he removes all transitions to new lines.  Those.  paragraph divisions, none at all.  Icq numbers I wrote in the column.  On paper, everything was written in line with one number.  With applications similarly.  In general, it turned out to be a dump that I could hardly figure out myself.  The jamb of the site or trite save paper. <br>  Next came the investigator's dialogue whether there are friends who are well versed in the PC.  At this moment it is better to pretend to be a naive fool, so faster. <br><br>  - Heard about violations? <br>  - A year ago, the provider had a vulnerability, we can add 0 to the map, i.e.  100 rubles to turn 1,000, and then into 10,000. And there they began to fold cards cheaply in transitions.  The shop worked for 3 months. It seems that even someone was planted after.  And so no longer heard. <br>  (You could certainly add that BDL was selling granny with fruit on the market, but said nothing. There was no granny for a long time, and I wanted to eat. Otherwise, questions would arise.) <br>  - Himself copied? <br>  - Of course not. <br>  - Well, yes, it was a case from a year ago.  In general, we will send to Moscow, and maybe something will come. <br>  Or will not come adds another employee. <br><br>  During this time, a man next had time to spread the kerchief 2 times.  And another, rewriting phone numbers.  I went to the university and then home. <br><br>  Got a letter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7ae68dc0/52ccc09a/29467da4/826754fd.jpg"><br><br>  It was reported that the case went back to Moscow.  (All about everything went a month.) <br>  By this time, I was dissatisfied with the course of events and sent a request to the Prosecutor‚Äôs Office.  They are like our supervisory authority.  So that followed the course of the event.  And they answered, is the law violated? <br><br>  Another letter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7533a9e2/077af608/b0a72268/ac0a7457.jpg"><br><br>  Those.  a letter from the regional department of my region left at the same time as the request from the prosecutor's office to the Ministry of Interior of Moscow.  That precisely answered. <br>  And from them in another month comes the answer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/68d7239a/747348ed/3e0c0170/f5e88f9d.jpg"><br><br>  In which they seem to have forgotten that my server is hanging.  And they are technically hard.  And recommend to contact the FAS.  Amazing reality, they themselves were not going to send anything.  Just the verdict: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for us, what makes us puzzled.‚Äù For a minute I presented the eyes of the district police officer, if I had come to him with a statement about spam, as I was recommended. <br>  FAS is a Special Organization.  By sending them letters, you will not receive notification that the letter has arrived.  And the administration of the region, the administration of the president, and other departments, as a rule, give the number.  Instead, they recommend playing a quest.  Write a regular letter in the age of information technology.  After a call and ask if it came?  And find out the number of the incoming.  Naturally, I just sent an email.  Spam by this time has stopped.  And I informed one data center that they were spamming.  He stopped, during the day, as a rule. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion: </h5><br>  I did all this solely out of interest, for which people pay taxes.  Turned on the white sheet, and while not much falls.  I also saw on TV how it was indicative that spammers were caught in Moscow, and they were charged.  But spam is not related, "illegal business activity."  In other words, if they paid taxes, they received a warning or a fine.  So we live.  And to be honest, I don‚Äôt see any problems here, spam came to the post office, find out which companies used, come to visit them.  Half will tell who provided the mailing service.  Make a test purchase.  Write out a fine.  EVERYTHING.  And even covered the counter with fake documents. <br><br>  Now I have entered into a dialogue with the FAS, the Coordination Center, and a couple of registrars regarding the domain RU and the Russian Federation.  If it is interesting I can paint the course of the event, the second consideration of the case will be the other day.  But in fact, it still turns out that no matter how, no one violated the rules!  And with the second-hand dealers and no one was going to fight, there is not a single point about this in the rules of registration.  And there is no collusion, because any citizen can become a registrar himself.  And about the prohibition to change the year of the owner, this is done with the aim to mislead ordinary people. <br>  (added) <br>  From achieved: <br>  - In the near future, when accessing the site, you will receive a notification of the delivery of a letter to the e-mail.  The person will clearly know that his letter has come. <br>  - The answer will be sent in the same way in electronic form.  That will speed up the transfer of correspondence. <br>  Now with them a little easier, you can have a dialogue in Faisbuk.  And there they answered why appeals about spam are rarely considered.  It is very difficult to catch a spammer.  By the way, the Ministry of Internal Affairs will be looking for him :) And since the appeal came to them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111841/</a></p>
