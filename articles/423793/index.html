Today Alexander Saraykin ( <a href="https://habr.com/users/hrenod/" class="user_link">hrenod</a> ), who helps companies from Europe and the USA to build infrastructure, answers questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ie/an/0g/iean0gh1oji_dqh4hsjlao-ho-0.jpeg"><br><br>  Alexander 31, he studied in graduate school at Penza State University, specializing in mathematical and software computers, complexes and computer networks, but did not finish it, because it was not very interesting.  He started working on outsourcing for a German company.  He learned German, moved to Berlin, then got into a startup, where he worked for about three years.  As a result, the donkey joined SourceStream and gradually moved from programmers to DevOps with a focus on infrastructure, Amazon services and other cloud providers.  Position on the business card comes up for himself.  Now there is an inscription cloud solutions architect.  Nevertheless, he continues to write for internal projects in PHP, and if he needs help, he will figure out Ruby or Python code. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0j/h2/yg/0jh2yg4nk5yfox5igrkjl41qplo.jpeg"><br>  <font color="grey"><i>Alexander and Python</i></font> <br><br><h3>  1. Tell me about the feature that you have implemented and that you are proud of. </h3><br>  Due to the specifics of the work of the architect - it will not be a feature, but a whole product.  From the current and what is being used now - in a short time it was necessary to launch the roaming platform for charging electric cars.  In the world there are a lot of "sellers" of these charges and outlets.  And when you travel, you need to sign a new contract with each of them, get a special card. <br><br>  The BMW Group decided to get rid of it so that you could refuel to any other with a card of one ‚Äúrefueling‚Äù.  It was successfully launched in Japan, then in Europe, and now in the States. <br><br>  My task was to make a scalable infrastructure for all this.  Such that the presence of DevOps in the future was in general not necessary.  Testing took somewhere a couple of weeks in pre-production mode.  But it was very scary to run.  If any garbage happens, then you understand it first.  After the launch, there was even a round-the-clock support period of two or three weeks, when my partner and I had a reaction time of no more than an hour. <br><br>  And I am proud that we have made this decision, damn, in time!  This is probably the only time in my career, when it was possible. <br><br><h3>  2. And now - about the most fierce fakap. </h3><br>  The story of how I learned to put a semicolon at the beginning of the command - so that it does not work.  For every fireman.  That case taught me to do that.  I was still a programmer, not an infrastructure builder.  We did something right on the sale.  I wanted to copy the conditions for deleting some records.  And at the end of this copy-paste there was a line feed, and the team applied even before I could add anything.  In general, the production base suffered.  But, thank God, there was a copy! <br><br>  For me the time was very long, the boss wrote to me: what are you doing?  But managed to fix it in an hour. <br><br><h3>  3. Describe your working space: from the chair and monitor to programming environments and favorite utilities. </h3><br>  I often work on the road with clients, and in principle I am on the drum, where to sit.  You call and say: urgent!  And then the conditions are not important.  Everyone has such a thrash going on.  Can be handles at the chair broken off.  And two days a week that you work, fight for your chair: you come, take it away, and next week it‚Äôs gone again. <br><br>  I do not need any kind of lifting tables.  But we have decent chairs in our office - ‚Ç¨ 600 each. I don't know, is it cool or not?  But they are comfortable.  I come to my office and just relax.  I have three monitors there.  Although I can work without them - just on a laptop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eg/qc/7q/egqc7qalgd2omfnpcmnaln_smxy.jpeg"><br><br>  But I had the best concentration on a small yacht for 10 people.  I went to the regatta, but I still had to do some work, so I took a laptop with me.  I was swayed, in general there was a tin.  I sat in the mess-rooms and just played to make it quicker, because I could no longer simply. <br><br>  I work mostly on Linux, Ubuntu.  Sometimes you have to take Macs - test that the rest of the command automation will work as it should.  The same Docker to run with the necessary mount'ami.  Once I needed to launch a tricky solution on Kubernetes, and then it turned out that it also needed to be launched under Windows.  I had to figure out how to raise something in Azure. <br><br>  I am writing in Java, Scala, Node.js, Python, Bash ... Anything.  Therefore, for programming, I use IntelliJ IDEA.  And we have everything in an adult way - not the community, but the purchased license. <br><br>  And there is a cool topic, which I advise everyone.  I have a whole bunch of clients, and everywhere I need SSH access to the servers.  For each of the clients, I naturally create my own set of keys and passwords.  I collected the SSH keys for each client in Keepass, and it automatically loads these keys into the agent when you unlock the database.  That is, they have never been saved on the disk.  It turns out that he finished the work, locked up the base, and all the keys were curled back. <br><br><h3>  4. On what basis do you choose a job?  Stack, product, living conditions, money? </h3><br>  Living conditions I do not care, as I have already explained.  Similarly, do not care if there is coffee in the office or not.  Many people say: I want good coffee and that you can still come with your dog!  I have it all on the drum.  I bill for an hour of work, so this is not the case. <br><br>  By the stack, of course, I choose.  I am looking for him to be useful in the future. <br><br>  For the money I have a lower bracket.  Although I can work for free.  There are projects that are very well paid, and some - not very.  But then we have a good personal relationship with these guys.  For example, if I have been supporting a project for three years, I can‚Äôt say that since there is no certain amount, I will not help. <br><br>  And the main factor, probably, is time.  If a client works in the American time zone, I say that I can work here at such hours, but not at other times.  The point is in personal convenience, I need to organize time during the week so as not to come to work as sleepy.  Although it happened that I was at the office every day by 5 am clearly, because I was very worried about the launch. <br><br>  And another important point is that the client understands you.  If your expectations are the same, you can work normally.  And if they expect from you that you will respond faster, spend more time at work, quickly close the task - then I usually immediately say: why don't you look for someone who will show himself better in these things?  But I, of course, continue to work until they find a replacement for me. <br><br><h3>  5. What would you like to fix in the technologies and languages ‚Äã‚Äãyou use? </h3><br>  Perhaps I have been doing all these things for a long time, so I got used to technology.  But I once bought myself a new computer - it was a Lenovo X1 Carbon.  And I was so upset when I myself had to write a driver for a fingerprint scanner!  It's not about the high price of a laptop.  Lenovo has established itself as a brand for developers, geeks.  And then you buy them a laptop, but Linux does not see half of the devices, and you need to invent something yourself.  And I read on the forum that this fingerprint scanner is supported, but it turned out that it was not. <br><br>  It turned out that I was not the only one, and some dude undertook to make drivers for this series of devices.  I fit in with him, also nakodil something and collected my stars on the githaba.  If not only it helped me - it's great! <br><br><h3>  6. Where better to adopt someone else's experience - in high school, on konfy, on Habr√©?  Somewhere else? </h3><br>  I still have a specific area where I look for solutions to infrastructure problems.  I think the basic knowledge came from their projects.  When you go to conferences, they all sell their decisions to you, which are "soaring smartly."  You get about a hundred options, but until you try everything yourself, no one will say which one is better. <br><br>  And in programming languages, some patterns are perhaps better described in articles.  If your domain involves event sourcing cqrs, then you search for Habr√© event sourcing cqrs.  There, probably, a little less ‚Äúvariables‚Äù than in the infrastructure. <br><br><h3>  7. If you had unlimited resources (time, money, power, people), what project would you do? </h3><br>  I would try to do something that brings more fun to people.  They are already working on such things: the same VR or SpaceX.  It sounds cool.  I would like to do something that may not even be aimed at making a profit.  Perhaps something liberalizing communication. <br><br>  I also heard about companies that develop molecules for sale - for specific purposes in medicine and other areas.  And this, of course, is a completely different market.  I do not understand anything about it, and I don‚Äôt know about investments, but it would be interesting to see how it works from the inside.  Only if I spent 10 years studying my profession, then how many will I need there?  Fifteen? <br><br>  In general, I am always interested in the question ‚Äúwhat's next‚Äù.  I change my specialization about every five years.  And now it seems it's time. <br><br><h3>  8. How do you relax?  What are you doing besides work? </h3><br>  A problematic issue.  In addition to work, I usually take some more work.  But I try to communicate with people, travel to other countries.  When you get out of the usual environment, you communicate with new people - that's cool.  For some reason, it turns out that you still find yourself next to IT specialists.  But even if you are surrounded by 70% of IT people, people with similar views on yours will be a maximum of 5%.  There will be so many different opinions that there is something to talk about. <br><br>  Leisure activities are cool: I want everything in the Alps (good nearby), but there‚Äôs something in any way ‚Äî basically I go somewhere warm.  Dronom learned to manage.  He was engaged in shooting from a firearm in the ‚ÄúObject‚Äù and even passed tests for entry into <abbr title="International Practical Shooting Confederation">IPSC</abbr> .  He was trained to ride a motorcycle, but did not get the right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6a/mr/xe/6amrxeqceonx_h79-aiqwxmhkny.jpeg"><br>  <font color="grey"><i>The phone is not only a working tool, but also an opener, if you choose the right cover</i></font> <br><br>  And sometimes it tires me, and then I prefer to sleep at home stupidly. <br><br><h3>  9. Tell about 3 favorite books - educational, popular science and art. </h3><br><ul><li>  I did not read the study literature, in my opinion, about five years.  But when I was interviewed at ThoughtWorks, I read the book by Fowler, which, in my opinion, still works there. <br><br>  In our office, of course, there are PHP3 books, but no one reads them, because they become obsolete very quickly.  They do not have time to publish, but already something new has appeared.  Although many consider it right to put some bookmark on the table for O'Reilly.  Any  If you are a Scala-developer, then you need to put a book on Scala.  Still have put a bookmark! </li><li>  From the popular science it was fun to read Neal Stevenson.  The latter was - "Semievie."  There he has about space fantasy.  But he tries to be very close to science, uses the help of experts.  And before that, he had a cool book called Kryptonomicon.  I advise everyone. </li><li>  And if at all artistic, I liked ‚ÄúAtlas Shrugged‚Äù.  And quite in his youth read "1984".  But the most interesting thing is that such books have become more relevant for me now than they did then.  You read and think: nifiga yourself! </li></ul><br><h3>  10. If a consciousness wakes up right in front of you in AI, what will you tell him? </h3><br>  There was such a cool movie "War Games".  There the computer came to the conclusion that the only correct decision was not to play.  So I would have thrown the AI ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a tip.  Just in case. <br><br>  But seriously, I am not afraid of such things.  It is the opposite all interesting and fun. <br><br><h3>  Question from <a href="https://habr.com/post/422339/">previous guest</a> </h3><br><blockquote>  <i>Realize yourself to be immortal or not aging, overcome the standard 70 years, two or three times, how would you live?</i> </blockquote><br>  I think, gaining rich life experience, I would try to spend time on something really important, and not all the rubbish that I do now. <br><br><h3>  Bonus: ask a question to another developer </h3><br>  Suggest a pumping strategy after the first 5 years of work as a programmer.  What's next? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Previous issues</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ol><li>  " <a href="https://habr.com/post/420321/">I am a useless fool and want to quit</a> " </li><li>  ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/post/420981/">I can tell you about the common pain of all iOS developers</a> ‚Äù </li><li>  " <a href="https://habr.com/post/421965/">In addition to work, I still work</a> " </li><li>  " <a href="https://habr.com/post/422339/">I think JavaScript is not suitable for the web</a> " </li></ol><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423793/</a></p>
