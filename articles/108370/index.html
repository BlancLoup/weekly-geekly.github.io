      <strong><a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6746/Which-Types-of-Form-Fields-Lower-Landing-Page-Conversions.aspx">What form fields reduce conversion?</a></strong> <br>  Dan Zarella describes the results of researching online forms on more than 40,000 pages, during which input conversion reduction fields were found.  Although the conclusions are rather brief, the information itself is more than useful. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2010/10/11/johnny-proudly-presents-content-strategy-week/">Content Strategy Week by Johnny Holland Magazine</a></strong> <br>  The online magazine Johnny Holland has published a series of articles on content strategy.  Its five main themes are organization, integrity, understanding, strategic planning and evaluation. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.eightshapes.com/blog/2010/10/26/8-principles-for-creating-ux-poster-deliverables/">8 principles for creating posters as the results of work on the interface</a></strong> <br>  Jason Wishard describes eight principles for working on interface posters.

But this is the best among such reviews, so if there is a need to explain this to any of your friends or colleagues, this article is perfect. <br><br><h3>  Instruments </h3><br>  <strong><a href="http://friendfeed.com/uxroom/254e634d/meego-ui-templates-screenshots-guidelines">Mobile OS MeeGo - templates, stencils and guidelines</a></strong> <br>  A collection of templates, stencils and guidelines for the mobile OS MeeGo from Nokia and Intel.

Still, the question itself is more than interesting - how convenient and understandable is the arrangement of the names of the form fields under them? <br><br><h2>  Process </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx%3Fp%3D1636982">Marriage of different religions: UX design meets agile development</a></strong> <br>  Larry Constantine describes the good and bad work scenarios of the designer and designer as part of a flexible development process.  In his opinion, one has to change mainly to an interface specialist, adapting to the existing process.  The second part of the article is <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx%3Fp%3D1636984">http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1636984</a> . <br><br><h2>  Cases </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2010/10/21/beyond-staggered-sprints-how-theladders-com-integrated-ux-into-agile/">How TheLadders.com integrated UX and agile</a></strong> <br>  The recruiting service design team TheLadders.com talks about how the process of working on the interface has changed as part of the transition to flexible development methods.  The article is especially good because the authors describe the whole way of the formation of a new process, including all the failures. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/automobiles/10FACE.html%3F_r%3D1">How to feel the complex interface?</a></strong> <br>  The story of how Ford collaborated with the IDEO design agency to bring interface ideas from modern smartphones to car dashboards.

She talks about what you need to know about the methodology and representativeness of such research. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/strategy/the-invisibility-of-disability">Invisible restrictions</a></strong> <br>  Alexander Dawson offers his own way of classifying the accessibility of products.  Its classification is good because it includes not only the physical limitations of users. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2010/09/how_effective_is_animation_in_detecting_temporal_trends.html">Study: How effective is the use of animation in showing trends?</a></strong> <br>  Enrico Bertini, from the online magazine Information Aesthetics, describes the results of a Microsoft study on the effectiveness of using animation in data visualization.
