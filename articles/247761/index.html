Despite the fact that some moments do not quite correspond to the realities of our country, you should be aware of world trends and start adapting to them ahead of time, because you still have to do it! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Prediction number 6.</b>  <b>Newspapers will reach a new level.</b>

      Newspapers are a relic of the past.  Some still like to read newspapers, but the absolute majority of modern people prefer to get news from online sources. <br><br>  However, the newspapers have only one trump card - official websites, whose popularity goes beyond the limit.  It is with their help that all publications, ranging from major national newspapers to small regional newspapers, are looking for new opportunities for existence and increasing profits. <br><br>  Usually newspapers create joint projects with commercial enterprises, seeking to improve their status, attract new audiences and reap financial gain.  For example, the Union Tribune newspaper bought Discover SD, which originally existed as a discount service for various events and services in San Diego (on the principle of the Groupon site). <br>  But until the acquisition of the site, the newspaper held several promotions for Discover SD on its official online news site.  It was a mutually beneficial campaign, thanks to which the Discover SD website increased the number of visitors, and the Union Tribune newspaper acquired a new source of revenue. <br><br>  In the new year, more and more companies will cooperate with regional newspapers, because they have a ready-made audience and interest in profitable projects that open up new opportunities. <br><br>  <b>Prediction number 7.</b>  <b>Companies will start creating their own programs, creating demand</b> <br><br>  Free application development has become one of the most popular forms of marketing.  In an effort to increase traffic, companies provide users with free tools like Grader from HubSpot Grader or Open Site Explorer from Moz. <br>  NEIL PATEL also developed its own free analyzer on the site and was amazed at the results - the number of visitors has increased dramatically. <br><br>  In the future, he will be able to use this tactic with even greater profit, but now many companies are actively introducing it into their marketing strategy, creating more and more free tools. <br>  Similar tactics work in any industry.  For example, if you develop a business in the field of loans secured by property, you can create and place on the site a free mortgage calculator. <br><br>  The possibilities are endless, and most importantly - this is the most effective method of marketing with maximum return with minimum investment. <br><br>  <b>Prediction number 8.</b>  <b>Site conversion optimization will be in high demand</b> <br><br>  In this case, we are talking about optimizing the conversion of the site not only from the point of view of the service, but that companies will soon start hiring professionals who specialize in CRO. <br><br>  These are completely unique skills that have not yet become widespread, however, over the next few years more specialists will improve on the conversion of sites and even more people who will want to learn this.  Why?  Because companies are willing to pay a lot of money to improve CRO. <br>  This is the only way to justify the ever-increasing advertising costs.  The more visitors to your site become your customers, the more justified the costs. <br><br>  <b>Prediction number 9.</b>  <b>Marketing research tools will be free</b> <br><br>  Google Analytics is absolutely free, Optimizely offers a rate at which services are provided free of charge, and even a tool like HelloBar is available for free. <br>  The number of similar free marketing tools will increase significantly over the next 12 months due to the fact that small and medium businesses are not able to pay for such services. <br><br>  At first, companies will provide your business with such tools free of charge, albeit in limited use, but still not demanding remuneration, because they understand that after a while your business will grow, and then they will present you with an account. <br><br>  <b>Prediction number 10.</b>  <b>People will start making their name brand.</b> <br><br>  Quite rarely, individuals turn their name into a well-known brand.  However, it has been proven in practice that such tactics can bring a large income and have a positive effect on the development of the business as a whole. <br>  Take, for example, the name Neil Patel: according to Google Trends, it is a more well-known brand than companies owned by this person.  Accordingly, he can use his name to promote his own business. <br><br>  So why don't you promote your business and your name in parallel?  Neal has been doing this for many years and can safely say that this method works wonders. <br><br>  Soon there will be more people who will actively turn their name into a brand, because in the long run this will have a beneficial effect on their business and allow them to get more profit.  In addition, companies are interested in hiring people whose names have already become a brand, since such employees are the basis of marketing evangelism. <br><br>  For example, Guy Kawasaki and Apple for many years led a mutually beneficial cooperation. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  2015 will be contradictory, but interesting.  While the search engines complicate matters, and the business becomes more transparent as a whole, new perspectives are opening up.  Do not be afraid of change, learn to adapt to them.  If you have time to adapt before your competitors, you will have a real chance to become a winner in the marketing struggle. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247761/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247761/</a></p>
