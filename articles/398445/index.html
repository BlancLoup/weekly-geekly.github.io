Since its inception, the studio has released all parts of Civilization, starting with the third, as well as the games of the X-COM and CivCity series.  The publisher of the game was the company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/2K_Games">2K Games</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The base cost of the game for US gamers is $ 59.99.  For the CIS region, the cost of the game is two times lower - $ 29.99, and for the Russian Federation it is set at around 2000 rubles or about $ 32 at the rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.

      The new part of the ‚ÄúCivilization‚Äù is currently available only for the OS of the Windows family.  Also, the game will need a video card that supports DirectX 11. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98b/bf0/bc0/98bbf0bc0ddec8654cef4f2a3d4b29d9.png"><br><br>  Judging by the recommended requirements, for a comfortable game in the new "Civilization" you will need a gaming computer of the sample of 2013-14.  The minimum requirements will be completely satisfied by a new laptop at a level slightly higher than an office typewriter. <br><br>  Unlike the previous part, in terms of localization, the Civilization VI release was approached more responsibly.  Since the start of sales, the game has been translated and fully localized for the twelve most popular world languages.  In particular, the game is fully translated and voiced in Russian: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/889/258/2b7/8892582b7eb94a9c7a7e4dd992fd0303.png"><br><br>  The developers did not cope only with the voice acting in Brazilian Portuguese, but the game was also translated and subtitled. <br><br>  Even before the release, the game was favored by critics and won several awards at the E3 show last summer.  There Civilization VI won in the nominations "Best PC Game of the Year" and "Best Strategic Game". <br><br>  The players of the first wave, in which, of course, there were quite a few fans, also greeted the game with delight.  At the moment, the share of positive reviews on Steam is 89%, and the rating of PC Gamer and PCGamesN publications is 93 out of 100 and 9 out of 10 points, respectively. <br><br>  For example, a spherical review on a game on Steam: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f98/af9/2b0/f98af92b03d992d0b91e2b5d806891d2.png"><br><br>  But if you look closely at the negative reviews on the game, you can see that not everything is as smooth as we would like. <br><br>  First of all, some users complain about compliance with system requirements, but at the same time the game refuses to start.  Most likely, the problem lies in the lack of DirectX 11, the presence of which is mandatory, but it is still too early to exclude the possibility of bugs or incompatibilities with certain configurations. <br><br>  There are also complaints about the abnormally long duration of the computer running on small maps and the initial stage of the game.  Some users, contrary to the opinion of the gaming press, write that the game has become inconvenient, turned out to be, and cannot be compared with the previous, fifth part of the series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0a/9b7/4e1/c0a9b74e1f296954a637fb2ac073bee8.png"><br><br>  The graphics of a new civilization really look like a cartoon: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab2/137/34b/ab213734b9befb368cb8306ae899a502.jpg"><br>  Civilization v <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c7b/57a/475/c7b57a475900992552489eb9fe8c6fe5.jpg"><br>  Civilization vi <br><br>  But this is a matter of pure taste. <br><br>  Of course, the success of the game must be followed at a distance, since in the first days of the voting and leave reviews, mostly ardent fans of the series who were waiting for the game.  Many experienced players are of the opinion that Civilization is not worth its money and are going to wait for sales on Steam, while others are willing to pre-order. <br><br>  Where Sid Meier and his team will lead the series and whether Civilization will stand the next test by the players - only time will tell. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398445/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398445/</a></p>
