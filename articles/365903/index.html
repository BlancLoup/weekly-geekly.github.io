  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CyberSkind: Yellow Spheroid</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  - Colonel, through the emergency channel Shadow sent a codogram.  According to her, in an hour the laboratory would be attacked by the Olds.  Their target is the Yellow Spheroid.  In the laboratory "rat", Colonel, no one else could know that security bots on long-term testing! <br>  - Captain, at what stage is the readiness of the Spheroid? <br>  - At 14-30, motor functions were fully covered, the progress of pattern recognition was fulfilled by 87 percent, but artificial intelligence ... The emotional area prevails over the logical one, the level of the child ... The combat systems are only short-range attack.  The null care effect is unstable. <br>  - Immediately block all neural interfaces and put the Spheroid into active state!  Documentation, including backups, immediately destroy! <br>  “But, Colonel ...” <br>  - Follow! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ——————————————— <br>  According to police, today in the center of the city a government laboratory of Colonel Sous Ek Ina was subjected to a bold attack.  The attack was carried out simultaneously by the forces of a gang that was armed with heavy lasers and plasma guns, presumably by “grandfathers”, and electronically.  Judging by the hacker’s “handwriting”, the attacker was one of the highest paid Chinese experts in the shadow world, Ba Bu Ash Kin.  Connections of attackers with triads are investigated.  The laboratory staff was completely destroyed, Colonel Sus Eck Ying was tortured before his death, his brain was literally burned out with a “scraper”. <br>  How our correspondent was able to find out from a source who wished to remain anonymous - the main development of the laboratory, the promising android of the latest generation “Yellow Spheroid”, managed to escape ... <br>  ——————————————— <br>  - Nousagi! <br>  - Yes, Sensei ... <br>  - The interests of the Corporation require that you immediately go in search of the Spheroid.  Both the Chinese and the Russians lead the hunt for him, the information about the "zero-care" should not get to them!  According to Shadow, all the spheroid's neural interfaces are closed, it will have to be physically taken.  T-grabs, kappa-terminators - use everything to catch it! <br>  - We have three capsules with “Scarlet resin”, Sensei ... <br>  “... The clans promised not to use it after the Tokyo metro was turned into a frozen hell ... Try to present it with the work of the Chinese ...” <br>  ——————————————— <br>  According to the police, on the outskirts of the city the Nousagi group, which attacked the notorious “Yellow Spheroid”, was completely destroyed.  Judging by the nature of the wounds, the defender used the “Jericho tubes” class acoustic weapons.  On the mutilated body of Nousagi, a vacuum container was found with weapons forbidden even in the underworld ... <br>  How did our correspondent manage to find out from a source who wished to remain anonymous - the promising android of the latest generation “Yellow Spheroid” managed to escape ... <br>  ——————————————— <br>  - Herr Professor, my customer would like to purchase your power grab equipment for the purpose of making new spheroids ... <br>  - Listen!  When I invented “black amber”, I immediately understood all the possibilities that it promises.  According to information from Shadow, I know who you are and what your goals really are.  My conditions: I have to take part in the capture of the Spheroid myself - in any case, your boobies will not be able to cope with my equipment!  100 million must be credited to my account - and before the operation begins.  Finally, the most important thing: after opening the Spheroid, I must have at my disposal complete documentation on the “zero-care” technique! <br>  ——————————————— <br>  According to police, on the outskirts of the city was completely destroyed by an unidentified group that attacked the notorious “Yellow Spheroid”.  The only identified corpse belongs to Professor Volfentshtein, the author of numerous works on Y-type capture force fields.  Judging by the nature of the wounds, the defender used the “Jericho tubes” class acoustic weapons.  The police are particularly concerned about the use of military-style exoskeletons by the attackers. <br>  How did our correspondent manage to find out from a source who wished to remain anonymous - the promising android of the latest generation “Yellow Spheroid” managed to escape ... <br>  ——————————————— <br>  - And I'll tell you so, boys!  Force fields, shunts - all this garbage!  There is nothing better than the good old psychodar!  To hell with him, that the neural interfaces are locked, I will contact directly, but for now he will come to his senses ... - the giant cyborg was hot.  At first glance, it became clear that his muscles were additionally strengthened by synth fibers, and large, prominent temples gave him a “psycho”.  “Heard, my guys recently cooked a new potion?  For an hour, but I'll be even stronger! ” <br>  “Mikhailo ...” - the cyborg stretched out smaller, with increased opto-interfaces ... As Shadow wrote down - the Japanese tried to take it, the Germans tried to take it ... Two groups are completely eliminated - of course, it will be good for us, there will be a big redistribution ... But I won't lose you before the new war ready ... <br>  - Owl!  Yes, I answer - I'll take it lukewarm!  And there the atomic saw and its memory will be before us!  Can you imagine how much any Corporation will pay for it?  But we still make a copy! <br>  - Good.  Need fighters? <br>  - No, Owl!  I vouch for you - I will take him alone! <br>  ——————————————— <br>  According to the police, on the outskirts of the city was found the corpse of one of the leaders of the Russian mafia, who attacked the notorious "Yellow Spheroid".  Judging by the nature of the wounds, the defender used the “Jericho tubes” class acoustic weapons. <br>  How did our correspondent manage to find out from a source who wished to remain anonymous - the promising android of the latest generation “Yellow Spheroid” managed to escape ... <br>  According to the editors, the police are not taking measures to catch the Spheroid in order to neutralize as many criminal elements as possible. <br>  ——————————————— <br>  - Shadow!  This is Lisowski!  “A raspy old voice filled the bunker with an echo ...” “I took it.”  What a cute boy ... What a cute boy was ... As you said, he was going to shoot and into me from this terrible, terrible stunning weapon ... But I just turned off the auditory contour as soon as I saw his silhouette, and then asked to transfer my grandmother across the road ... </div>
