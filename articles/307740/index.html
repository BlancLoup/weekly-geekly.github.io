Be sure to spend more time planning rather than real action;  do several things at the same time as often as possible;  work hastily and on autopilot and complete your schedule to the top! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae6/971/c6e/ae6971c6e2a84b479a334a4edd45057e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <strong>Let's be frank:</strong> if there are a lot of articles on increasing productivity, there are almost no articles on how to reduce it.

      Here are <b>10 reliable ways to reduce your own productivity</b> for each day. <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Spend more time planning, not action.</font> </h2><br>  Yes, without making plans is not enough.  It is rather difficult to maintain high productivity if the process does not get distracted by thinking about the strategy needed for this.  But the constant return to thinking about the upcoming actions only reduces the time for the work itself, and the performance begins to fall. <br><br>  The more minutes you spend on planning, the less they will be left to complete the task itself. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Use multitasking</font> </h2><br>  This point is hard to overestimate: <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/tselesoobrazna-li-mnogozadachnost/">multitasking is an absolute evil</a> (one of them, in any case) that can be used against your own performance.  The fewer things you pay attention to at a certain point, the more noticeable is your result. <br><br>  If you want to become less productive, then multitasking is just what you need. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Run on autopilot</font> </h2><br>  When you try to solve too many tasks at the same time, or the time is not well distributed, you start acting on autopilot.  This makes it difficult to purposefully work on truly important matters.  If you want to reduce your results, then, noticing the transition to autopilot, do not resort to planning.  Instead of this‚Ä¶ <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Fuss</font> </h2><br>  Reducing the pace of work - for losers.  This gives you the opportunity to think about tasks and act more intelligently.  Wanting to become less productive, fussing as much as possible - and even doing several things at once, if it is available to you! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Less rest</font> </h2><br>  Breaks - during the day or longer - allow you to "recharge".  They release your mind to freedom, which leads to more successful ideas and increased creativity.  If you do not move away from work, the brain begins to arrange their own breaks on their own.  Not to mention: if you want to achieve less every day, reduce rest to a minimum. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. Score your schedule</font> </h2><br>  And preferably - to the eyeballs.  If you want to reduce productivity, you just need to leave as little space as possible for unforeseen situations that arise during the day.  And you do not need time to dive into larger projects that you are working on.  Be sure to attend as many meetings as possible and hold your own to "touch" all active projects! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. Forget about training.</font> </h2><br>  Physical activity helps us to get rid of stress, which is especially important today, because every day we find ourselves face to face with a large number of negative factors than any of our ancestors. <br><br>  Without paying enough attention to training, we often encounter fatigue and burnout.  To become less productive, reduce physical activity to a minimum.  And at the time of the appearance of fatigue, do not forget to <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-poluchit-ot-kofeina-maksimum-energii/">whip up caffeine</a> ! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">8. Sleep less than 8 hours</font> </h2><br>  Sleep greatly affects the performance of our brain.  If we sleep less than 7.5 hours, the level of energy, ability to concentrate and performance decrease.  Sleep is one of the most profitable options for <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/zdorovyy-son-4-soveta-ot-kosmonavtov/">exchanging time for power</a> .  That is why you need to spend less than 8 hours on it if you want to reduce your productivity. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">9. Forget about nutrition.</font> </h2><br>  Energy is the fuel that we burn throughout the day, fulfilling our tasks.  Rejection of the right "gasoline" is able to deprive us of strength and effectiveness.  Processed foods with a very high content of sugar, salt and fat send our energy on a rollercoaster journey.  But they are so delicious ... <br><br>  So do not hesitate: eat a large pack of waffles in syrup <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/8-del-do-8-utra/">before the start of the working day</a> ! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">10. Cut yourself off from others.</font> </h2><br>  Social interaction is also for losers.  Yes, it makes you happier, increases motivation and enthusiasm for business more than anything else.  Therefore, by doing so, you will experience a decrease in productivity! <br><br>  If you strive to do less every day, be sure to try all the methods described above. <br><br>  In conclusion, it is worth paying attention to another point.  There are correct and erroneous ways to reduce productivity.  Effectiveness is unthinkable without premeditation. <br><br>  Working and living consciously, we increase our productivity, even if we are talking about <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/inogda-dlya-dostizheniya-celi-polezno-prosto-nichego-ne-delat/">conscious doing nothing</a> , aimed at rest and recharge.  You show the best result when you reach your goals, and when your intentions coincide with what seems useful and meaningful to you. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the topic of work on yourself - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/dostich-balansa-raboty-i-lichnoy-zhizni-5-shagov/">How to achieve a balance of work and personal life in 5 steps</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307740/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307740/</a></p>
