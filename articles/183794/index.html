  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tests of new and not very old games and programs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  Hello everybody! <br>  I think that someone can find something interesting and curious in this.  I am engaged in tests of games on an old (well, or not at all) hardware, just often out of curiosity and a desire to see if any piece of hardware will pull a toy / program that is designed for more modern systems. <br>  Actually, this post was created to recruit requests for the next tests, which I later with pleasure and in the smallest details will post here.  I am not a professional in terms of iron, so if someone finds my cant, please correct. <br><br><h4>  Equipment in stock </h4><br>  The piece of iron has accumulated enough to be inspected for the year ahead. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sistemnik: <br>  1) The motherboard MSI K7D Master has two heads, the original Athlon MP 1900+ and sawn Athlon XP 1800+ under MP 1900+ and slightly overclocked.  The second, respectively, heats up more, but little, copper radiators with coolers enough for the eyes.  Suddenly, 2 gig of register DDR, you can put the usual one, but the configuration of the mother does not allow you to put more than 2 gigs, but you can put the register up to 4, however, it is not so easy to find it, and it costs money.  PSU 350 W, enough, screw 250 GB IDE, then I want to transplant to the SATA controller and put a new fast screw.  ATA100 is a limiter, speed has to be squeezed out of old boxes to the full.  Perhaps the computer is not too old, however, tests on it give unexpected results. <br>  2) Motherboard ECS PM800-M2 with Celeron D 2.53 GHz and gig first DDR-ki, nothing special, but as a test machine also come down.  In some organizations, such configs are still running.  Already served as a test of the built-in vidyahi S3 Unichrome, and on it clumsily, but the second Half-life went.  It has a 40 gig screw Samsung. <br>  3) Motherboard ASUS CUV4X-D two-headed, two P-III 933 MHz, motherboard with a long history and two plump capacitors.  You can put up to four gigabytes of SDRAM 133 MHz, but the toad has been stifling too much at least 512 MB of SDRAM, other boxes need no less memory.  At the moment, has a deceased 40-gig screw Samsung, therefore, requires attention. <br>  4) Tekram K7KX-A motherboard with an Athlon 650 MHz processor, suddenly Slot A. I got it at the flea market for 100 rubles, all covered with snow and mud.  After cleaning started as good as new!  It has 512 MB of SDRAM and can have up to 1 GB if the memory does not name, but I will not put more, I guess.  It has a screw of only 15 GB, but it‚Äôs almost unused, Quantum Fireball that has lain peacefully for several years. <br>  5) Motherboard GA6-VA7 with a variable processor (at the moment a test is being sawn on it), 640 MB of memory is also a temporary measure.  She, of course, has a bit of AT format, but she gladly climbed into a full ATX, and I didn‚Äôt even have to adjust it, the feeling was that Gigabyte decided to cut off a piece from a full-fledged mother and fill it up with mikruha, as it turns out.  And they turned out well, I must say, the screw holes are exactly the same as on adult models.  It has a buggy USB on board, and the PS / 2 sticks out there only with pins on the board, so you have to use the COM mouse.  Screw 40 GB Fujitsu, works, like, without a glitch. <br>  6) The box from HP, model Vectra 4/66, is equipped with a motherboard on the 4th socket and a 486DX2-66 processor, 8 mb SIMM and a S3 Trio video card at 1 mb.  The existing screw 800 mb is alive and injects, as if nothing had happened.  It was written off from the hospital, it has Win 95 and Office 97 that was already installed, the latter rather slows down to 8 MB of RAM and sometimes crashes. <br>  There is one not very working motherboard on Slot 1, something from ASUS in the spirit of P2L with P-II 266 MHz, I can try later.  I can rent a friend for PI beer, but the box is pretty buggy and works through time.  There are even a couple of spectra of varying degrees of death, who want to connect to the TV for more than a year, but their hands do not reach, and I'm lazy. <br><br><h5>  Video Cards </h5><br>  Why I did not write about them in sistemnik?  Because they go from one box to another for different tests and therefore non-permanent. <br>  Gigabyte GeForce 5900XT 128 mb; <br>  Nvidia Quadro4 900 XGL 128 mb; <br>  Palit GeForce 4 Ti4200 128 Mb; <br>  ASUS GeForce 3 Ti200 64 mb; <br>  ASUS GeForce 2 Pro 64 mb; <br>  Nvidia Quadro 2 Pro 64 mb; <br>  ASUS GeForce 256 32 mb; <br>  ASUS Riva TNT2 Pro 32 mb; <br>  Inno3D Riva TNT2 M64 32 mb; <br>  3Dfx VooDoo Banshee 16 mb; <br>  3Dfx VooDoo 3 8 mb; <br>  S3 Trio 3D / 2X 8 mb / 4 mb; <br>  Trident 9750 AGP 4 mb; <br>  Matrox Millenium 2 AGP 4 mb; <br>  S3 ViRGE / DX PCI 2 mb; <br>  ATI Rage II + PCI 2 mb; <br>  S3 Trio64 / V2 PCI 4 mb; <br>  S3 Trio64 / V2 PCI 2 mb; <br>  Cirrus Logic 5446 2 mb with a TV tuner on board; <br>  S3 Vision868 PCI 1 mb;

      UPD: S3 Savage4 32 mb; <br><br><h4>  Some problems </h4><br>  Yes, there are problems, and they lie in the fact that the screws are often old, and they are already pouring in slowly, the power supply units, especially from the time of simple ATX, also do not shine, gradually work worse, although there are no visible damages like capacitors on them, and I Not a system engineer with a soldering iron on "you."  Particularly tricky BP-shniki with AUX cord (looks like a half AT) is generally rare, and I am glad that I have at least one of these dug up in the local flea market.  For some reason, to find such a power supply is difficult, and if it fails, 2x933 will be without power.  Some video cards come in stripes and artifacts, the pride of the GeForce 6800 Ultra has already covered itself (somehow got drunk on beer and stayed in grief), went on the GeForce 4 Ti4200 stripes, somehow working as S3 Vision868, a fan of ATI Rage II +. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  As a result, I want you to ask me to leave requests, I can summarize them and then post them.  Each test can take up to several hours, and therefore requires more preliminary preparation and cleaning of seal from the room so as not to interfere.  There is still a IBM Thinkpad test on the basis of the P-I 133 MHz and 48 MB of RAM (got to my friend), and then a joint test of this laptop with my Fujitsu, also P-I 133 MHz, only 32 MB of memory.  Let's see which of them is more productive.  Ahead, as soon as there is extra money, there will be a kind of test of the dual-core Athlon X2 3800+ with GeForce 6600GT PCI-E against the already mentioned 2x1900 MP with 6600GT AGP.  Perhaps the result is already a bit predictable, but who knows.  Some of the material can be read on our website old-hard.ru, there are already some tests there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183794/</a></p>
