    <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  About Kebrum VPN </h4><br>  After the last post, we were tested for strength - we processed a lot of tickets and answered a bunch of questions.  There were a lot of problems, but, in my opinion, we could not solve the situation with only one client.  It‚Äôs boring to list small fixes and bugs, so I‚Äôll just say that we have added something fundamentally new. <br><ul><li>  Now all servers can work using both the UDP protocol and TCP.  There is a switch in the client and a field for additional settings has been added.  What does this mean specifically for the client?  Now you can access the Internet where NAT is poorly configured, as well as in places where the Internet is accessible only through a proxy.  It may be useful to those who will use the service at work. </li><li>  Due to numerous requests, we have made for you a <a href="https://kebrum.com/billing/">web billing</a> that will allow you to register, pay for the service and download the file with the config for self-configuration.  I think many will be glad of this opportunity.  For those who overestimate their strength and can not cope with the setting, there is always a client. </li><li>  Previously, you could check the client‚Äôs performance through a demo server that turned all traffic on itself, and now you can connect to a real server and surf the Internet.  It is clear that we do not guarantee the speed and quality of work of this server, but to fully verify the VPN connection on your computer, this is quite enough.  The server is located in Odessa, so that everyone can try VPN for free. </li><li>  On the client download page, the GeoTrust stamp now stands out, confirming the existence of our company.  A nice addition for those who still doubt the legality. </li><li>  And on the same page, you can now see the RPM package for OpenSuSE and Fedora.  In principle, I think it will work on almost all distributions based on RPM, but so far we have only tested these two. </li></ul>  The main task now for us is the issue of blocking all traffic on the client‚Äôs computer when the connection is broken.  We tried a couple of ways and stopped at the option that you have to write your own drivers.  If someone has cunning ideas on this subject, then by all means speak.  We will always be happy to hear suggestions and wishes.  We are pleased to do something really useful. <br><br><h4>  About copyright </h4><br>  Someone thinks that the information must be free, someone sees his bread in it, someone doesn‚Äôt consider or see anything, but simply downloads.  Where does that line end when the law on ownership of some type of information ceases to be convenient for humanity and becomes a burden? <br><br>  In fact, everything is quite simple.  Copyright laws are laws.  And the laws are issued in the interests of the authorities, according to their needs and ideas.  Therefore, just like any other law, the law on copyright expresses the interests of the authorities.  If we want to build a society where everyone can earn more money (the only priority), then copyright is developed in the right direction.  If we want the prosperity of mankind, then we must make the information free, and labor, directly - paid.  And protect labor.  A singer should receive money for the performance of a song, for a performance, or, as a last resort, for the convenience of submitting his songs (well, it is more convenient for someone to buy from iTunes, rather than look for where to download).  And the law should protect the singer from another singer who can start singing his songs for money.  Or from a merchant who, using these songs, can provide a service by selling a disc with these songs (the exclusive right of the author).  But in no way should the law protect a singer from teenagers screaming with a guitar in the yard, or from a fan who downloads this song.  This year there was a case in Moscow when veterans were sued for performing songs of their youth.  If we want to build a society where the law is above man and common sense, then this is a normal situation.  If we want the development of mankind through the development of each person individually, then something goes wrong. <br><br>  Therefore, before arguing about the details of the law, let's decide what goal it pursues, and only then we can justify the effectiveness of a particular method. <br><br>  <b>We are waiting for questions and suggestions, continue to do something <s>oh</s> awesome, your Kebrum Corp.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107754/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107754/</a></p>
