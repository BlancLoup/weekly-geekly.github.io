It would be, by the way, to make this sin in the <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/ultima/blog/25016/">list of mortals</a>

      Where does the importance of balance come from and what is it in practice? <br><br>  In most cases, the work of an employee of the organization can not be exhaustively described by a single indicator. <br><br>  For example: if we pay the seller only for sales, then the profit will definitely suffer. <br>  Even if the prices are fixed and the seller cannot give discounts at his own discretion, we recall that in any trade there are goods-locomotives - generating turnover (but with a minimum margin) and attracting buyers, and accessories-goods are small in price, but with high profitability and precisely on which profit is earned. <br>  This dualism is quite universal.  So, many people know that networks sell a substantial part of the names of washing machines and mobile phones below cost - generating a margin on installation services and cover-case films, respectively.  But few people know that the symbol of a corrupted America - McDonalds - McNuggets cheeseburgers also trades in the negative.  Agents of the world behind the scenes earn their billions on french fries and Coca-Cola.  The composition of "complex meals" remember? <br>  <i>More details for those interested in <a href="http://www.ultimaerp.com/results/purchase_matrix/">http://www.ultimaerp.com/results/purchase_matrix/</a></i> <br><br>  In short, in the example with the seller, the sales volume is a very correct indicator, but it alone is not enough. <br>  The KPI ‚Äúsales volume‚Äù needs to be BALANCED to others: for example, profitability.  The seller must be motivated to sell not only expensive steam locomotives, but a profitable low-cost coupler. <br>  Ask, and what would be stupid not to motivate the seller to gross profit from sales?  Perhaps in a limited number of cases it will be a good solution, but in the realities of a competitive market ... Remember that "locomotives" are sold with a minimum mark-up, and even in minus?  Then it is easy to imagine psychiatric cramps that cover the average seller with the realization that if he sells a single TV, his salary will be LESS. <br>  However, even for such cases there are solutions, although not technically simple, we will tell about them in the next series. <br><br>  Some experience in designing the SMMP led us to conclude that <br>  a) for any productive position (that is, NOT the parasite <a href="http://www.ultimaerp.com/results/self_born_worm/">http://www.ultimaerp.com/results/self_born_worm/</a> ), there is a pair of mutually balanced calculating KPIs, one of which characterizes the amount of work performed by a person, and the second - quality. <br>  b) the use of this pair of KPIs as the basis of the motivational formula for this position is necessary and sufficient for obtaining the best result. <br>  For convenience of future use, we call this statement the volume-quality axiom (ALC). <br><br>  Pay attention to the word ‚Äúbase‚Äù in paragraph b): other indicators may well participate in the motivational formula, but: <br><ul><li>  they must be <b>additive</b> - a plus / subtracted bonus \ malus, and not multiplicative with a volume-quality group </li><li>  their contribution to the total income should be <b>significantly less</b> than that of the base pair OK.  Not more than 25%. </li></ul><br><br>  It is easy to notice that our example about the seller‚Äôs motivation on the basis of sales volume and KPI of profitability balancing it is a special case of the KLA.  The sales volume is the volume of work performed by the seller, profitability is the quality of this work. <br><br>  All ingenious is simple.  AOK is easy and AOK works great. <br><br>  As practice shows, the main part of practical difficulties is the correct definition of what constitutes a quality indicator for this position (usually, there are no questions with KPIs). <br>  However, such quality indicators <b>always exist</b> .  The question is whether the KIS used by you allows them to be collected and processed. <br><br>  PS A waiter in a restaurant who lives only on tips (or a fraction of them) is an infrequent example where motivation is completely described by a single indicator.  This waiter is close to a private entrepreneur. <br>  However, (tm), if we take a closer look at the ‚Äúindicator‚Äù of a tip, we will see that it includes <br>  - volume indicator (usually 5-10% of the total bill), <br>  - and quality - ‚Äúif you like the service, the service is not included in the bill‚Äù.  <a href="http://www.ultimaerp.com/why/">The principle of "pay if you liked</a> . <a href="http://www.ultimaerp.com/why/">"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300224/</a></p>
