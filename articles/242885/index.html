  <section class="page js-page"><h1>For what Google applications blocks. Bylina</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb1/a50/8fc/bb1a508fce7b4ac59b52f9dd85971a70.png"><br>  One fine sunny day, I finished work on my application and decided to post it on Google Play.  The application - the usual dice, nothing criminal, no games for play or real money, just a couple of kinds of games on the bones for two people or with AI.  It was decided to create 2 versions, free and paid - without ads and with additional bonuses.  Both applications were moderated without incident and appeared on Google Play.  I was already delighted and began to mentally prepare for buying a yacht, like Abramovich‚Äôs, but it was not there. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A couple of hours after placing the application, I receive a letter from Google: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Letter 1</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c66/b54/c73/c66b54c735594c2d80f88b8b462b0b46.png"><br></div></div><br>  Koreans did not like the game.  There is not a hint of any games for money or chips, but still they decided to block it.  And only the paid version, no one bothers with the free version at all, although the differences there are minimal.  For me it was, of course, sad, because Korea is a large market for selling games on Android, but oh well, they can be understood, even though my game is not for money, it falls under the imitation of gambling.  Although there are such gambling games in the marketplace, both paid and free, some even play on inside the game currency bought for real, and nothing ‚Äî hundreds of thousands of races and places in the tops of ‚Äúdice‚Äù, ‚Äúslots‚Äù, ‚Äúcasino‚Äù and etc. <br><br><pre>  &lt;sarcasm&gt; </pre>  If this were all over, I would have calmed down and forgot this sad event, but the evil, specially trained Koreans decided so simply not to let me go. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The specialists</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edc/63d/99b/edc63d99b2ed4d2f8381d7d2e53e2545.png"><br></div></div><pre>  &lt;/ sarcasm&gt; </pre><br>  After about 18 hours, I received a new letter with the following content: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Letter 2</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/497/330/6eb/4973306eb7c64375910cb7c1d97476fc.png"><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">See this article, namely section 2</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41b/e1b/b94/41be1bb94d4742438a60c4d954d7a202.png"><br>  <i>Article 23 (Restrictions on Collecting Personal Information)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(1) This includes the following information:</i>  <i>It is not necessary to state the rules of law.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(2).</i>  <i>It doesn‚Äôt give a message that you can‚Äôt give you any information.</i> <br></div></div><br>  If you believe Google, my application collects some NRRN, which is prohibited in Korea, where the application is already blocked almost immediately after moderation.  The funny thing is that in the paid version of the game, which even after blocking the Koreans continue to torment them, there is no advertising at all, no authorization anywhere, and I have been using all connected assets for a long time, like other tens, if not hundreds of thousands of users Unity and they did not cause any such problems. <br><pre>  &lt;sarcasm&gt; </pre>  If Unity3D was developed, they decided to use my application insidiously and collect this NRRN from a couple of Koreans who might ever buy my game to send Dr. Evil to underground laboratories in order to demand a million dollars for them. <pre>  &lt;/ sarcasm&gt; </pre><br>  As a result, no one touched the free version, and the paid one was blocked.  I did not understand the reasons for blocking, because the game does not collect any data, there is simply nothing to collect.  In addition to the code written by me, there is an asset for localization in the game, which checks the system language in order to install the corresponding one in the game.  As well as asset files <a href="https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-plugins">google ads</a> and <a href="https://github.com/playgameservices/play-games-plugin-for-unity">google play services</a> , which remained from the free version and were not cleared for the release of the paid version.  But in any case, all these 3 plugins have been used by me for a long time, and not only by me, but also by many Unity developers.  And did not cause censures. <br>  And now I am at a crossroads.  Or put up with a sad look <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">okay google</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05a/b23/749/05ab237494c442c4a773f39aa333d65b.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  Or try to pour the same application on luck without any services in the same language, it can blow it, although who knows where they found this collection of NRRN and whether the reason is really in these assets, because there were no complaints about them.  Or write to Google support, although after reading <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/231009/">this article</a> , as Google just bans the entire account after contacting their support, the desire has disappeared. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Filing an appeal</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre>  &lt;sarcasm&gt; </pre>  I stopped at the first step.  Suddenly, if I click "No", Google will "finish" what has been started and send the entire account to the ban. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59b/999/8a3/59b9998a380b485eb1a6262830d722a8.png"><pre>  &lt;/ sarcasm&gt; </pre><br></div></div><br>  Here is such a sad and unsophisticated story. <br>  Has anyone met with such or guess what the reason for such a violation? <br><br>  UPD: After filing the appeal after 7 hours I received the following answer: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af7/7d1/353/af77d1353adb4af4b3bdd6b4abcdf9c6.png"><br></div></div>
