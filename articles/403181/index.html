  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Italian pizzeria warmly supported cryptocurrency</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In May 2010, a legendary event occurred for the cryptocurrency world.  The young Bitcoin-Miner Laszlo Khanesh then went down in history as the first person to pay for the purchase of real goods using Bitcoins (BTC). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1ce/2cd/697/1ce2cd6972194baa9c5f27401c570506.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Laszlo was one of the pioneers of GPU mining, which allowed him to accumulate a large supply of cryptocurrency.  He paid Jeremy Sturdivant 10 thousand BTC for the purchase of two pizzas for home delivery.  At that time, such an impressive amount of koin was equivalent to just a few dollars, but today you can get a fortune on the open market - $ 20 million.

      The celebration of this first real bitcoin transaction is held annually on May 22.  At that time, you could not buy anything for bitcoins directly: Laszlo had to convince another enthusiast from the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php%3Ftopic%3D137.0">BitcoinTalk</a> forum <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php%3Ftopic%3D137.0">to</a> pay for pizza with his credit card in exchange for Lasco's Bitcoins.  Today, however, cryptocurrency payments are gaining momentum, and not only in Bitcoins. <br><br>  Today, when it was 2017 in the yard, there was <a href="https://btcmanager.com/italian-restaurant-embraces-waves-cryptocurrency/">news</a> that the Italian restaurant and pizzeria called <a href="http://gustodivino.es/">Gusto DiVino</a> announced the start of accepting tokens of our blockchain platform <a href="http://wavesplatform.com/">Waves</a> as the preferred currency for paying orders.  The place is located in Santa Ponsa, in Mallorca - the majestic island chain of the Spanish Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean.  Its owner is Marco Aviledo, also known as <a href="https://twitter.com/deepred86/media">@ deepred86</a> .  Marco is an active member of the Telegram-Waves community, contributing to the global distribution of cryptocurrency. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Avoledo with its business partners Andrea Gianpiero Lilia and Alice decided to choose WAVES as the payment method.  They posted this message on their website: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe future is cryptocurrency!  We really believe in it and therefore we now accept $ WAVES as a payment method in Gusto DiVino! ‚Äù. </blockquote><br>  According to Avouledo, after launching the platform, he tried to create a test token.  Realizing how easy this procedure is, he began to think about the possibility of integrating something similar in his restaurant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/391/417/c59/391417c59dc64551aa04d419572e3fba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Italian and in my home country I was engaged in IT.  Then I decided to move to Mallorca with my whole family and start a new life, devoting myself to the culinary world.  Considering my knowledge in the field of information technology, I decided that it would be great to combine my two passions - pizza and crypto. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Avoloedo's love of pizza and cryptocurrency led to a search for ways to offer customers a new generation of payment options. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúMy first thought was to create PizzaToken and send one such token for each pizza bought.  As planned, as soon as customers collect 10 tokens, they can send them back to me and get free pizza. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  When WAVES <a href="https://btcmanager.com/waves-of-sidechains-hit-full-crest/">launched</a> their fiat payment gateway for operations with the euro, the host decided to start accepting cryptocurrency, which allowed him to make a direct exchange of tokens for euros and vice versa, without fear that the tokens would lose their value (even if all the funds at one time or another) be in the Waves). <br><br>  Version 0.4.22a of the Waves Light Client includes support for the Euro-gateway.  As in the case of Bitcoin Gateway, it allows users to deposit currency into the Waves blockchain, where it further turns into a separate Waves token (WEUR) that can be kept on the account, moved or traded on DEX in the best traditions of direct, non-mediated interaction between users.  Now with the help of the euro you can pay for the purchase of WAVES and tokens hosted on Waves projects - WCT, Incent, MobileGo, EncryptoTel and others.  And you do not need to move them from the gateway to the wallet - they will already be there immediately after the deposit. <br><br>  In contrast to the Bitcoin gateway, when dealing with currency, there are certain requirements on the part of anti-money laundering legislation, as well as compulsory practices for checking customer loyalty.  It so happened in our world that not a single financial institution is exempt from such regulatory requirements in the 21st century.  However, here too we tried to make the procedure as easy as possible: it only requires a remote verification of the person to confirm the authenticity of the documents provided.  After that, the user is able to freely deposit funds into the Waves platform and retrieve them at any convenient time. <br><br>  Recalling the case of Laszlo, which occurred more than 7 years ago, we can say that now we have the first WAVES user who performed the similar operation Gusto DiVino.  Here is how the owner of the institution describes this case: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThey called me and asked for a table for two that evening, specifying that payment would be made using WAVES.  I was surprised that I received my first guest with WAVES on the same day, 3 hours after the announcement of receipt of this payment.  It was an English guy with his girlfriend, who at that time was just resting in Mallorca and tweeted about the possibility of payment using WAVES. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  According to Marco, he was shocked, because this guy turned out to be a newcomer to the world of cryptocurrency.  It seemed to him a very good sign, because it means that they ‚Äúattract not only geeks or crypto-traders of heavyweights, but also people for whom this topic is new.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2d0/14e/340/2d014e340d3d44239c03abb2c05df934.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Marco continued his story: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we could not continue the conversation further, since that evening turned out to be very turbulent for the restaurant.  The payment took only 20 seconds, and in a couple of clicks I could convert the received amount into euros if I wanted.  We were really impressed with that speed. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  According to the owner of the institution, cryptocurrency receive a very good reception in Spain.  People are well aware of them and the possibility of paying for purchases with their help. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe pay taxes on checks WAVES as we do for cash checks and credit card transactions.  As far as practical aspects are concerned, our accountant takes care of everything else, so we don‚Äôt worry about anything and devote ourselves to the preparation of great food. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  And finally, Marco said the following: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI decided to organize the reception of WAVES, since this project has earned me confidence from the very beginning.  Ordinary bitcoins are great, but WAVES is faster, a cool community has gathered around the platform, and it needs new real-life cases.  Today we can buy almost anything with BTC, and pizza was generally the first product bought for bitcoins.  My goal is to show the world that Waves is a powerful ecosystem.  If you show everyone else how fast and easy it works, they will also start using it.  And I dream that WAVES is waiting for just such a future. ‚Äù </blockquote><br> <a href="http://www.wavesplatform.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e7/48c/593/2e748c59324447e6b1dc02f60019d20e.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403181/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403181/</a></p>
