After 3 years, the first store opened on the Web - <i>Pizza Hut.</i>  Further, with a difference of a year, <i>Amazon</i> (1995) and <i>eBay</i> (1996) projects were launched.  E-commerce was the pioneer of the Internet ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  There is a problem </h5><br>  15 years have passed.  In this rather short period of time, we have witnessed the explosive growth of the Network.  Today, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Skype and many others offer their amazing services.  The Internet has become an integral part of our lives.  But what happened during this time in the field of e-commerce?  Nothing that would change the methods known since 1996: we are looking for new products in online stores, while second-hand we buy them at auctions and bulletin boards. <br><br>  Maybe everyone is satisfied with the existing state of affairs?  Market analysis and own experience show that this is not entirely true.  And if you bought something over the Internet, you also had some problems. <br><br><ol><li>  The first problem of a spherical customer in a vacuum is choice.  Is it worth it to overpay for Philips TV, if a similar Samsung model is cheaper?  What to give his wife on March 8?  Birthday friend? </li><li>  Next - search for the best deals on the web.  Where is cheaper, faster, safer and more convenient to buy?  The following two result from this problem. </li><li>  Verification of data published by the seller.  But first you need to call. <br>  <i>- Hello, the Philips R4103 / 518 KA plasma panel is available? .. Sorry.</i>  <i>And W7468 / 520 YS? .. Discounts for this model are distributed? .. When can you deliver?</i> <br>  And so from one to twenty times.  If we get lucky. </li><li>  Finally, tricks and deception.  Even if you did everything correctly - there is no guarantee that, for example, you will be sold goods manufactured for your country (localization, warranty). </li></ol><br>  Sellers have their own difficulties.  They need to do something so that buyers find their products: to engage in optimization (to order relevant texts, to buy links, banners, to pay for transitions from catalogs).  All this waste - financial and temporary ...

    <h5>  Win-win solution </h5><br>  One of the reasons for the current problems is that Amazon and eBay transferred the offline trading model to the Network, and the other players simply copied it.  In an offline world, a merchant is not mobile: since he is tied to a display case with goods, he cannot immediately respond to requests from customers who are far from his store.  The model works: ‚Äúmany buyers - one seller‚Äù. <br><br>  And on the Web, a buyer can instantly communicate their needs to a wide range of sellers.  Traders have the opportunity within a minute to make an offer (certainly profitable) to a buyer who lives a thousand kilometers from the store.  Sellers are no longer tied to a display case with goods.  Let's go even further - they don‚Äôt need it at all!  The model works: ‚Äúone buyer - many sellers‚Äù. <br><br>  In this model, sellers are directly notified of the desires of the consumer.  They can help the buyer with a choice and offer suitable products.  Accordingly, the intermediate stages - the search for the goods by the buyer and the verification of published data - are eliminated.  Sellers, instead of attracting buyers to their storefront with goods, can focus on sales. <br><br>  We conclude that the first model (‚Äúmany buyers are one seller‚Äù) is certainly possible, but unnatural for the Internet. <br><br><h5>  What do we offer </h5><br>  <a href="http://yaber.ru/">Yaber.ru</a> is a service in which buyers publish their requests for the purchase of specific goods.  These requests are sent to specialized sellers.  And then there is a direct communication of buyers and sellers.  Relationships between users form a social network.  See it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/cb9ab897/5a1c1125/37bdf907/214b62c3.png"><br>  <i>The main page is a feed of all published user requests.</i>  <i>Sellers, applying the filter, can choose interesting applications.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/47ce2c4a/ec9dc9cf/ed2cadae/7981e70e.png"><br>  <i>We tried to simplify the application creation interface as much as possible, leaving only the most important fields.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2e59f3b0/ddc99641/a1ee8e53/dab985df.png"><br>  <i>Sellers offers.</i>  <i>Each offer is a thread in which the correspondence is conducted.</i>  <i>Threads can be closed or added to favorites.</i> <br><br>  In order not to overload the topic, I will limit myself to the description of the main idea.  In the next topic, I plan to tell you in detail about our service.  How it was planned and how it turned out.  In the meantime, I invite you to the discussion in the comments. <br><br>  PS Removed the girl who wants to look at her can follow the link - <a href="">habrastorage.org/storage/5965ed19/e3129404/3d1a92e1/5d36915b.png</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114735/</a></p>
