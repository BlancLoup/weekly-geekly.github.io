So I bet that it is useless to promote your phone applications in the absence of a lot of money. <br>  That amounts smaller than $ 10,000 can be considered a donation. <br><br>  I had to prove my thesis to a sober head. <br>  I chose three known methods of paid promotion of the application to the masses. <br><ul><li>  Buying reviews </li><li>  Buying advertising </li><li>  Buying Rating </li></ul><br>  Each action was spent no more than $ 200. <br>  An old game <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/king-of-hearts/id400694692%3Fls%3D1%26mt%3D8">King of Hearts was</a> chosen as a guinea pig. <br>  The outcome of the bet is under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Initial conditions.  Prior to the experiment, the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/king-of-hearts/id400694692%3Fls%3D1%26mt%3D8">King of Hearts</a> app brought in between $ 1 and $ 5 per day.  The average number of downloads is 10-20 per day.  This is a classic offline offline card game for children, clerks and builders on a smoke break.

    <h4>  Overview </h4><br>  Review was ordered on the <a href="http://appadvice.com/appnn">appadvice.com</a> service. <br>  From these guys came a letter that they would make a review and newsletter for only $ 99, instead of the standard $ 200. <br>  I gave them money, as a result I received a good review text in English and 10% -50% of additional downloads during the week. <br>  At the noise level, we will consider 5 dollars beaten off. <br><br>  Thus, the overall result of the survey company is minus $ 95 dollars, but now I have a good English text in the chest that can be used anywhere. <br><br><h4>  Advertising </h4><br>  Advertising was bought on a radish.  Or <a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit.com</a> . <br>  I periodically published on this resource short links to my free games on the advice of someone from the <i>habr-user</i> , and some of the ads was even successful.  1 time. <br>  I gave 100 dollars (it is very easy and convenient for them to take money) for advertising a game on a radish.  The tariff was chosen - show all the right people for a week, until a hundred dollars run out. <br>  Total - 0 additional downloads. <br><br>  Thus, the total result of the advertising company is minus $ 100 dollars. <br><br><h4>  Rating </h4><br>  Rating bought from the service <a href="http://fresh-reviews.com/">fresh-reviews.com</a> at the request of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ivanff/" class="user_link">IvanFF</a> . <br>  The guys wrote me reviews for King for 3000 rubles ($ 50 at the February exchange rate) for 30 reviews with an average rating of 4.5 stars. <br>  5 stars seemed immodest and suspicious.  In addition, as a bonus, I received 30 reviews of three more of my applications. <br>  As a result, the rating of applications has risen, there was a small surge in downloads. <br>  To write a review, you need to download the game - perhaps from here and growth). <br>  In all applications, except King, no additional income was found. <br><br>  For King, the situation is better.  Admob ad changes are not found.  But on advertising from Chartboost received a surge in profits of up to $ 10 per day.  50 dollars spent, I think, got out. <br>  The result - a positive rating and reviews.  Apparently, the rating somehow affects the CPM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/690/8c8/7c2/6908c87c247342899464271394fca8a8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After the experiment, the application King of Hearts brings from 3 to 10 dollars a day.  The average number of downloads is still 10-20 per day. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  To promote a mobile application in 2015, it is necessary to spend large sums and beat in all directions.  Otherwise - money down the drain. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257285/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257285/</a></p>
