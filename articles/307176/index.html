We have already ordered the main course SM961 with 1TB of memory to the table, but for now let's see the dessert, which comes in the form of the two most popular SSD tanks on the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c08/e34/cb8/c08e34cb836f4db5875e0402140862ad.png"><br><br>  Today we compare the SM961 512GB and 256GB with other NVMe-based products.  Two drives that we test today are cheaper than drives on the market, but still they do not dominate in all categories of performance. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

Of these, we expect that only three will be available, as we think we should not expect too many sales of SM961 drives with 128GB.  Samsung did not release the version of the 950 Pro with a capacity of 128 GB, and it made sense, because this product is only for enthusiasts and experienced users. <br><br>  Samsung's new Polaris controller is in the heart of all SM961 solid-state drives, paired with the new 48-layer MLC V-shaped NAND memory cell.  Many of the 850 EVO SSDs migrated to the 48-layer TLC NAND V-memory cell and the portable SSD T3 also comes with it, so this is the first product that comes with the latest version of 3D Flash from Samsung's MLC.  The 48-layer flash is the first such 256 Gbit drive, and it should reduce the price of existing SSDs, and also gives Samsung the ability to make new high-capacity drives. <br><br>  Today we look at the 256GB and 512GB models, which, according to the manufacturer, give a higher than 3100 MB / s sequential read speed.  The 256GB drive reaches up to 1400 MB / s sequential write speed while the 512GB drive gives up to 1700 MB / s.  The SM961's random read rate is 330,000 IOPS, while the random write rate is 280,000 for the 256GB model and 300,000 for the 512GB model. <br><br><a name="prices"></a><br><h2>  Price, warranty and accessories </h2><br>  Samsung SM961 does not produce the department responsible for the 950 Pro and other retail products.  It is developed by the Samsung SSI Group, which makes products for OEMs and large system integrators such as Dell, HP and Lenovo.  Large companies get access to SSI products earlier, but over time, SSD drives leak through distributors and then to intermediaries.  This circuit is commonly known as the ‚Äúcanal‚Äù. <br><br>  Australia, namely Ram City, has a history of launching Samsung SSI products in the retail market.  The SM961 256GB is priced at $ 159, and 512GB for $ 280, both of which are cheaper than the price of the flagship 950 Pro, a Samsung NVMe retail product.  SM961 pricing is also pegged to the Australian dollar, so prices may vary.  The prices we give in this article were given to us before considering the SM961 with 1TB.  Since then, the Australian dollar has lost 10 percent to the US dollar, thus making the SM961 SSD cheaper for American buyers. <br><br>  Ram City has been selling the SM961 with a 3 year warranty, but since this is an OEM product, it is not supplied in the Samsung retail package and does not include any accessories.  The company wraps the discs in an antistatic bag that goes inside a cardboard box lined with foam.  Delivery from Australia to my office in Indiana takes from three to five days, depending on what time I placed the order before or after the weekend. <br><br>  <b>Gaze</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8b/40e/6cb/f8b40e6cb12a412194ff5b32e2640a6b.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/227/c27/c2b/227c27c2bf5b4a2da96efce70f5a7c74.png"><br><br>  All three SM961 drives that we tested use the same configuration with the new Samsung Polaris controller and two NAND flash packages.  Samsung simply changes the amount in the package to adjust power.  The discs are all one-sided so that they fit in the thinnest spaces.  Some of the new laptops support only one-sided design, since the connector M.2 sits very close to the motherboard.  Drives are 80 mm long, also known as M.2 2280. Marking "2280" indicates the width (22mm) and depth (80 mm) of the SSD. <br><br><a name="performance"></a><br><h2>  Performance testing from four corners </h2><br>  <b>Compare Models</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dee/429/039/dee4290393a2440eac81ee0e1b4311c3.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d4/63b/586/0d463b58649d4f628e10bdcf8ed3fe28.png"><br><br>  Intel 750 Series (400GB), OCZ RD400 (256GB), OCZ RD400 (512GB), Samsung 950 Pro 256GB, Samsung 950 Pro NVMe 512GB, Zotac SONIX 480GB <br><br>  In this review, we focused solely on the NVMe 256 and 512 GB SSDs.  Such a sample will make it easier to compare the presented drives.  We did not compare the SM951 model and instead report on the results of a very similar in performance model 950 Pro. <br><br>  Both Intel and OCZ (a division of Toshiba) sell products that fall within this power range, but Intel only offers 750GB SSDs in 400GB (along with 800GB and 1200GB models are not present in our graphs).  The Zotac Sonix has a Phison PS5007-E7 controller with 15nm Toshiba MLC NAND.  Currently the only retail SSD is available with an E7 controller. <br><br><h2>  Sequential read performance </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8eb/ded/f4e/8ebdedf4ed7e46b3952c5a585f9b6b0e.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f55/971/13d/f5597113d8c042ebb014459d426d5fee.png"><br><br>  Both SM961 SSDs show impressive sequential read performance that outperforms all other products in the charts, something the same with the 1TB model.  Close results are not surprising;  Samsung lists all four SM961 SSDs with a difference of only 100 MB / s in the workload. <br><br><h2>  Sequential write speed </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13d/b7c/ef4/13db7cef4ebc454fbccecde120013289.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a3/dfc/3de/2a3dfc3de605468ebb1cd562b7bb0af3.png"><br><br>  The 512GB OCZ RD400 is the only product on the graphs that can work at the same high recording speeds consistent with the SM961.  The diagram also shows the RD400 with a wild drop in performance half way through the test.  The failure was due to thermal protection, but the issue of thermal protection in SM961 is clearly resolved. <br>  The speed of Samsung SM961 256GB was 1400 MB / s, which is only 300 MB / s less than the 512GB model.  The SM961 256GB works much better than advertised, so the difference between the two products is significantly less than expected. <br><br><h2>  Random Read Performance </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/389/0e1/30a/3890e130afe144a3ae0181e937cf8e82.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/423/092/646/423092646fee4ca79daa4453962e518b.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/169/174/654/169174654f14431fb2e8b8c1c0efec9d.png"><br><br>  In the SM961, SSDs raise the bar with an arbitrary read speed at a shallow queue depth, and we have only a small performance boost compared to the 950 Pro.  The SM961 hits a brick wall of about 170,000 IOPS at high queue depths.  An unexpected limit led us to believe that Samsung is limiting the performance of the firmware.  We read reports on some SM961 SSDs that have more than 500,000 random read IOPS by increasing the number of threads and the queue depth to 256. Using several workers (threads) puts out several queues, but this is not a comparison of apples with apples. <br><br>  Host software places external I / O requests, they stack up and wait for their turn to be serviced.  When the request is completed, the SSD controller places the terminating part in the completion queue.  NVMe protocol supports up to 64000 queues per device, and each can add up to 64000 commands.  The manufacturer of the SSD ultimately determines how many queues and how many teams for each of them will support the SSD (however, they may differ).  Samsung can use multiple queues at shallower depths, which could explain an earlier plateau of performance. <br><br><h2>  Arbitrary write speed </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a9/cae/4cb/7a9cae4cb236436abc5655eba0ba2415.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8cd/760/1ea/8cd7601eabcf47429d534c6ab225db25.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9b/9d6/4fe/d9b9d64fe5a84cdf96b849fbea5d731e.png"><br><br>  In SM961, products also have a sharp plateau in a random write test.  The limit comes much earlier, in this test, with a queue depth of 4. Of our four tests, a random entry gives the SM961 the most trouble.  This test is one workload where the new Samsung NVMe SSD cannot surpass the previous generation. <br><br><h2>  Mixed loads and stable condition </h2><br><br>  <b>80 Percent sequential mixed load</b> <br>  Our mixed load testing is described <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/how-we-test-storage,4058.html">here</a> in detail, and our tests are described <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/how-we-test-storage,4058.html">here.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/722/1ba/123/7221ba1233784ed9958e63a686500fc8.png"><br><br>  Even though the SM961 has the advantage of 100% consecutive tests, it significantly loses them compared to mixed serial data.  In the past, we have already encountered this type of behavior, which changes after updating the firmware, to increase the mixed performance of the workload.  SM961 SSDs are still in production, and we are testing with the first mass firmware.  Samsung usually does not release small updates, so when a new firmware is released it will be delivered with several updates at once. <br><br>  Samsung SM and PM series firmware upgrades pose other problems when buying a bare disc.  Users usually <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/Laptops-and-netbooks/ThinkPad-X-Series-laptops/ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-20BS-20BT/downloads/DS038904">get updates from HP or Lenovo</a> .  These updates are not advertised using traditional means.  As a rule, users may stumble upon an update, and then exchange information in a technical forum. <br><br>  <b>80 Percent Random Mixed Load</b> <b><br></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/934/74f/077/93474f077e0b49f9a70946ab4c7c67ff.png"><br><br>  The SM961 256GB and 512GB work much better with mixed random loads compared to other drives.  The advantage of random read performance at a shallow queue depth is seen during this test.  With greater queue depths, we see a performance limit, it comes into play again only at a queue depth of 16, while the performance of the Intel 750 continues to scale.  Intel 750 uses a 9-channel controller designed for corporate use, so the result is not surprising. <br><br>  <b>Consistent stable condition</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87f/c12/5de/87fc125de0ee4c74b78b0d79cea02a87.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78f/256/474/78f2564747be44579f1a22fc0a1083ce.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/182/9da/6fd/1829da6fdf734fa79dc26bf3d96f06f0.png"><br><br>  The consistently stable test shows us that the Samsung Samsung 48-layer flash delivers nearly identical performance for older 32-layer flash drives.  In this test, we put a big load on the flash to study the ability of the disk to process new data on dirty cells.  Diving an SSD into a steady state triggers its cleaning algorithms; during such a long period of intensive use, you can see its performance. <br><br>  The SM961 and 950 Pro do not have any significant backup areas required for Over-Provisioning (OP).  The 950 Pro 512GB delivers the highest performance in this test, but only by a small margin.  The 950 Pro 512GB is equipped with a twice as many NAND compared to the SM961 512GB, which gives it the advantage of greater parallelism and increases its performance. <br><br><h2>  Random recording permanently </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f7/5bb/32f/0f75bb32f6e1420bbc1a74091bda140f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d8/40d/50d/7d840d50d9e5498db1efdd85878c0ce6.jpg"><br><br>  The SM961 512GB SSD provides the highest performance recording data of consecutive 4KB random numbers in a steady state.  The Zotac Sonix 480GB peaks at a higher speed, but it cannot maintain performance for very long;  it also drops dramatically after sustainable use.  The Intel SSD 750 takes up space between two SM961 drives while the SM961 with 256GB is behind it. <br><br><h2>  Software Performance and Conclusion </h2><br>  <b>PCMark 8 Real-World Performance Software</b> <br><br>  For more information on software performance testing methods, please <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/how-we-test-storage,4058.html">click here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f97/1e2/c8f/f971e2c8ffe84fdbae2293231f08b3ec.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0f/da0/010/d0fda0010afa45c5864b92c48f68fd25.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a0/2b5/a41/2a02b5a418ad40318f50b9e1266e78ca.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/670/e84/fce/670e84fce21949d19d34a4e2498e93d1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/781/d23/ec8/781d23ec89604be196c2fd3458183890.jpg"><br><br>  Samsung SM961 drives did not become leaders in our software performance tests, as one would expect.  We checked the disks using the Microsoft NVMe driver built into the Windows 8.1 operating system.  The 950 Pro comes with a dedicated Samsung NVMe driver, which improves performance, but the driver will not be installed with the SM961.  We also tried HP NVMe INF drivers from other Samsung NVMe products, but there was only a slight performance increase compared to SM961 1TB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a1/bdc/dfe/9a1bdcdfe02f49d6969365199e9a9f75.jpg"><br><br>  SM961 SSDs are about 950 Pro, but desperately need to update the driver to overtake it.  We turned to Samsung Semiconductor to get the NVMe driver for the Polaris controller, but we were told to use the Microsoft drivers at the moment.  Over time, we will see a driver configured specifically for the SM961.  There are only drivers with this SSD from Lenovo, but the P70 and X1 Carbon Gen 4 do not include the list of drivers supported by the SM961.  We will monitor and report new test results as soon as a new driver appears. <br><br><h2>  PCMark 8 Advanced Workload Performance </h2><br>  To find out how we experience high performance workloads, please <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/how-we-test-storage,4058.html">click here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa7/201/362/aa720136276748cb813f99207775fdee.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/668/ecd/dcc/668ecddccb1d419a8dae96c2ac83f592.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c22/966/d0f/c22966d0f7654aad99425a464ae3e32a.jpg"><br><br>  SM961 performance problems in real-world software applications appear in tests of high and moderate workload.  Both SM961 SSDs need more time than our test allows us to restore maximum performance.  A small amount of over-provisioning will improve performance with the new 48-layer NAND memory in these low-capacity SSD drives.  And as a compromise, the user can manually assign a spare area in the formatting process, but at the same time lose some of the performance. <br><br><h2>  Access time </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e7/28a/7e4/6e728a7e4ff3491a8b5675cad5dd1bcc.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acf/f76/750/acff767507f24301af83ff77d6637d95.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c22/e32/05c/c22e3205ca1c45829ac4728d27780e5e.jpg"><br><br>  The Intel SSD 750 works with a delay, and it also uses the largest backup space (full 112GB).  The SM961 512GB slightly exceeds the 950 Pro 512GB in many recovery tests, but the SM961 256GB does not have enough parallel read and write speeds to outperform the 950 Pro 256GB. <br><br><h2>  Disk free time </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7f/919/4d1/b7f9194d1c89472db6f87f8cceaf4b31.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps many readers are unfamiliar with measuring disk busy time.  SSD goes into action when an input / output request comes to the drive.  The SSD completes the task as quickly as possible and then goes back to its inactive state.  ‚ÄúBusy time‚Äù is the length of time from request to completion (if at least there is an external 1 I / O connection).  SSDs typically use less power when they can complete a task and quickly go back to idle. <br>  The SM961 and 950 Pro 512GB show almost identical results in this test.  The SM961 256GB performs the test somewhat better under high loads compared to the 950 Pro with the same power, but it loses the advantage as soon as the load decreases. <br><br><h2>  Laptop battery life </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb6/aa8/539/cb6aa85399194134b34ab6abbacdeba5.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5a/275/62a/d5a27562a3ca4c769007509cc843ac7e.jpg"><br><br>  Our new Lenovo Y700 laptops allow you to test NVMe SSDs with MobileMark Bapco 2014. Many of the m.2 solid-state drives provide about 330 minutes of battery life during an office application test.  In the Samsung 950 Pro, NVMe SSDs provide approximately more than 40 minutes of battery life than other SSDs and show a better rating than the SM961 performance during the test. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  If you already have a 950 Pro, or its fellow SM951, I see no reason to buy a new SM961, unless you are looking for an SSD with a larger capacity.  Prior to this drive, the lowest price for a 1TB NVMe SSD was $ 770.  Samsung‚Äôs aggressive pricing policy for the SM961 will certainly make the upgrade to 1 TB more acceptable. <br><br>  The two smaller SM961 SSDs that we tested today also reduce the cost of entry.  The SM961 256GB for the price of less than $ 160 is a great deal that competes with the premium SATA SSD.  Price parity with SATA 6Gbps drives is a good way to boost NVMe sales.  The same can be said of the SM961 with 512GB of memory, but we are still talking about $ 280. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3c/a76/9a4/b3ca769a48324b74ad95ec20eac10609.jpg"><br><br>  Both of the proven SM961 SSDs do not show large performance gains for the user, and the 950 Pro SSDs provide slightly better performance in some real-world applications.  The difference in performance is relatively small and not sufficient to cover the price gap.  Do not hope to update the firmware, as most of them will come from unauthorized sources because of the status of OEM-SM961.  We believe that the SM961 will be able to offer more in the future after flashing the flash or updating the NVMe driver. <br><br>  In any case, the prices speak for themselves, the SM961 delivers the best value for money spent on high performance computing. <br><br><h2>  SAMSUNG SM961 SSD </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aec/050/11c/aec05011c542471e8d7fa834ea62eb1e.jpg"><br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  PROS <br></td><td>  MINUSES <br></td></tr><tr><td><ul><li>  Lowest Cost NVMe Solutions </li><li>  High throughput </li><li>  M.2 Form Factor </li></ul><br></td><td><ul><li>  Could use firmware tune </li><li>  Availability </li></ul><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><a name="conclusion"></a><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  The Samsung SM961 SSD series, in our opinion, has an excellent price-performance ratio.  256Gb and 512Gb disks look very attractive, but we expect additional performance optimization in the future, as well as software support, including Samsung Magician software. <br><br>  The company <a href="https://ruvds.com/">RUVDS</a> , following the global trend of lower prices for SSD, also announces a price reduction.  Until the end of the summer, we reduce prices by 40% on SSD drives on <a href="https://ruvds.com/">virtual servers</a> RUVDS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/9af/7bd/4539af7bdb06466cbd7cd42d1edb4b43.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307176/</a></p>
