The meaning of such services is as follows: <br><ol><li>  You enter a phone number. </li><li>  You are sent a confirmation code. </li><li>  You enter this code. </li><li>  From this point on, you are considered to be officially signed up for some kind of service (either one-time or not). </li></ol>

      The catch is that operators request the legitimacy of connecting any service from the companies that connect this service (these companies are called partners of cellular operators).  Moreover, the sending of notification and confirmation of the connection of any service lies entirely on the conscience of the partners of the operators (content providers).  Also interesting is the fact that in the billing of some cellular operators (for example, Beeline) there is no information about incoming SMS, i.e., if they tell you that they have received an SMS, they will not be able to prove it. <br><br>  All this makes it possible, for example, the following scheme: <br><ol><li>  On January 1, at seven in the morning, your phone number is entered. </li><li>  The operator is sent a notification that you have permanently subscribed to such a service and confirmed this service. </li><li>  40 p. Are being debited from your account.  every day, until the money runs out or you notice their leakage (if you pay for the phone once a month, you can easily lose a thousand rubles). </li></ol><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the same time, when contacting support, they can prove to you in every way that everything was legitimate and that money cannot be returned.  You may be asked to turn off these subscriptions so that the money will no longer be withdrawn, however, in this case, they can do their best to complicate the process of unsubscribing (for example, for Beeline you need to send an SMS with the text ‚ÄúStop‚Äù to each connected number; office or with the help of support staff). <br><br>  <b>However, all this is a direct violation of our laws, so if you have time, contact the police and, for example, the FAS (hypothetically, this will not only return the money, but also impose a fine on OpSoSov, as well as cover such schemes).</b>  If there is not much time, then at least some of the money can be returned without getting up from the chair (more on this at the end of the article). <br><br><h4>  What to do to make it impossible for me to sign up for such paid services? </h4><br>  Another problem is that some providers do not allow completely to refuse any paid services in the future.  So, for example, MTS has a service ‚ÄúContent prohibition 0‚Äù, however, for example, it does not turn off the number 2210 (which can cost you 20 rubles each day). <br><br>  But this is at least something.  More information about these services is written in this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/134369/">post</a> .  <b>Be sure to connect them.</b>  Here it is also important to remember one thing: if you <i>already</i> have some subscriptions connected, then these commands will not allow you to disconnect them (this should be done separately). <br><br><h4>  I have written off N rubles and paid services are connected without my knowledge - how to disconnect them and return the money? </h4><br><ol><li>  Log in to your personal account and request statistics for the past few months in the Excel format. </li><li>  Call the support of your operator and find out which paid services of content providers you are connected to (from which numbers) and from what date. </li><li>  Filter in the Excel records for these numbers and add up the damage caused to you.  It is important to know how much you need to refund.  You can also try to ask the support team to do it for you (maybe they will tell you this amount). </li><li>  Explain that these services were connected without your consent and that you personally did not confirm their connection, no SMS with requests came to you. </li><li>  If they tell you that you have confirmed your participation, ask for the download from the billing of the cellular operator, where all the cases of such incoming SMS will be indicated. </li><li>  In conversation, you can hint that such actions can be collectively classified as fraud in accordance with Art.  159 of the Criminal Code.  The actions of the operator himself in this case can be classified as complicity (in particular, complicity) in accordance with Art.  33 of the Criminal Code. </li><li>  It is possible that you will be offered to return only part of the amount (for example, 490 rubles instead of 825).  If you continue to be politely denied, it may be worth agreeing to this amount, warning that, however, you will hand over a written complaint for the remaining amount.  So you instantly receive at least some amount. </li></ol><br><br>  If you have reached the last item and have not received a refund (or have not received it in full), write a complaint (text below).  First, you can try to do this by email in support of the cellular operator, then go to the nearest office.  If this does not help, then all that remains is to write a statement to the police. <br><br><h4>  Sample claim text for refund </h4><br><br>  Claim <br><br>  Starting from January 1, 2013, my number +7 123 123-45-67 was written off in the total amount xxx p.  for paid services to short numbers 9106 and 2210, which I did not connect and did not confirm. <br><br>  The XXX support service cannot reliably confirm the legitimacy of connecting these services, since the billing of the company does not show the fact of incoming SMS from these numbers, and the correctness of the connection is requested from the content providers themselves (i.e., exactly arbitrarily and connected these services) and partly referred to as support partners of the company "XXX". <br><br>  Once again I draw your attention that I did not give direct consent to connect the service to my number.  My rights were violated as follows: <br>  - connection of the service without the consent of the subscriber; <br>  - withdrawal of money from the subscriber‚Äôs account for a service that is connected without his consent and is renewable at the initiative of the service provider until receipt of a direct refusal from it through the office of XXX. <br>  ... which may be collectively classified as fraud in accordance with Art.  159 of the Criminal Code.  The actions of XXX in this case can be classified as complicity (in particular, complicity) in accordance with Art.  33 of the Criminal Code. <br><br>  XXX p. Was returned to my account at the request of January 21, I propose to immediately refund the balance of my phone in the amount of the remaining XXX p.  without deducting the cost of taxes and any other commissions. <br><br>  January 21, 2013 / Ivanov I.I./ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166507/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166507/</a></p>
