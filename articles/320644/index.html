But if the lead magnet is used correctly, it will help build long-term relationships with the customer, and move it down the sales funnel. <br><br>  Today we will tell you how to come up with a valuable lead magnet that will lead to instant target action. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  How to find a lead magnet theme? </h3><br>  In order for a lead magnet to perform its task, whether it be a subscription to a newsletter or a purchase, it must be relevant to the user.  Therefore, first find out the interests of your potential subscribers and customers.  What do they want to receive: a discount, knowledge, a solution to a certain problem, or maybe your advice?  And that will help you.

      <b><i>Search query</i></b> <br><br>  Use search query statistics inside your business.  In Google AdWords Keyword Planner or Wordstat Yandex, enter a keyword or phrase related to your service or product - this is how you can determine the most popular user queries. <br><br>  <b><i>Google Analytics</i></b> <br><br>  For more detailed analysis, connect Google Analytics.  Keep track of which links most click on your site.  The most visited blog articles will help you navigate the lead magnet theme. <br><br>  <b><i>Social networks</i></b> <br><br>  Analyze pages of reputable sites in your industry: which topics are gaining more likes, which are better shared.  Sometimes users themselves can suggest an idea for a lead magnet by sharing their problem in the comments. <br><br>  You can also use the Buzzsumo service, which estimates the number of rassharivaniya and likes on social networks Facebook, Twitter, Google+. <br><br><h3>  What lead magnets to use? </h3><br><h3>  ‚Ññ1 E-book </h3><br>  The e-book will help to collect the address database, but that‚Äôs where its usefulness is not limited. <br><br>  Take a look at how Product Psychology, using an e-book, systematically builds relationships with subscribers and fosters interest. <br><br>  On the main page of the Product Psychology website you will see a subscription form with the indication: ‚ÄúStudy the consumer psychology, lesson by lesson, right in the mailbox‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0e/dc0/054/c0edc00545a14ab086c604aac9780545.jpg"><br><br>  By subscribing, you will get the promise - twice a month, free e-book lessons will be sent to the post office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/132/6fa/2e6/1326fa2e6be74c8b9eeef87b8fc26afb.jpg"><br><br>  The company meets the expectations and thus demonstrates a stable value for the subscriber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d02/285/391/d022853919b44fefb2fa6b787b55b9a3.jpg"><br><br>  <b><i>What to consider when creating an e-book:</i></b> <br><br>  1. Identify the target audience and analyze what problem the e-book will solve in your industry. <br><br>  2. Add a call to action to your book so that a potential client can be interested.  After reading the book, recommend one of the options: <br><br>  - sign up for a consultation; <br>  - contact the author; <br>  - trial version of the product; <br>  - to join the group of social networks and so on. <br><br>  3. Accompany the text with detailed images - so you simplify the perception of information.  You will need high-quality and professional photos, or good graphics. <br><br>  4. Think over which format is best: PDF or Google Docs.  PDF file is easier to download and the location of text blocks and images will remain unchanged.  And the fact of downloading a file to a computer causes people to have a feeling of ownership. <br><br>  5. If you are blogging, you can combine a series of articles into a book and create a newsletter based on it. <br><br><h3>  ‚Ññ2 Webinar </h3><br>  A webinar as a lead magnet will suit companies selling a product-specific problem solution. <br><br>  Neil Patel, a marketer, blogger and author of numerous books and articles on Internet marketing, collects a base on his website using a webinar with the heading "How to attract 195,013 visitors per month without spending a single dollar." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a9/56d/9de/5a956d9dee284f2db1a83696b4279fa9.jpg"><br><br>  Such a formulation catches the user.  Let us analyze in detail how its lead magnet works: <br><br>  1. <i>Bright call-to-action button:</i> ‚ÄúYes, I want Neil to teach me how to grow my business.‚Äù <br><br>  2. <i>Time limit.</i>  The subscription form indicates that the webinar will begin in 2 minutes and 3 seconds.  Alternatively, you can transfer the webinar to the next day, but not later.  Thus, a sense of urgency is created, and you are more likely to sign up. <br><br>  3. <i>Email-thanks.</i>  After registration, a letter comes with gratitude.  It contains a link to the webinar and indicates the time of its beginning.  There is also a warning that the restriction of places is valid, so it‚Äôs best to hurry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/658/023/060/65802306075d4e96a3170cdab1c6c434.jpg"><br><br>  At the end of the webinar you are offered to subscribe to regular newsletters.  And if you agree, Neal has one more potential client.  A subscriber acquired in this way is potentially more loyal to your product, because he has already managed to appreciate its benefits. <br><br>  At <a href="https://www.sendpulse.com/ru/academy/">SendPulse Academy,</a> you can learn how to promote your business for free from speakers with many years of experience in Internet marketing. <br><br><h3>  # 3 Research results, reports and statistics </h3><br>  For research, select a topic that will be of interest to potential customers, but poorly represented on the market.  So you can create valuable content that will attract users. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.getperfecthealth.com/">Healthcare</a> website <a href="http://www.getperfecthealth.com/">www.getperfecthealth.com</a> collects email addresses, offering to download a free report in return.  It includes tips on working with stress for everyone who is often exposed to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/463/83e/fc4/46383efc4f5f415c910b4ac7073caa5c.jpg"><br><br><h3>  ‚Ññ4 Check-lists </h3><br>  Check-lists or useful lists are a mini-cheat sheet, which contains a number of necessary points for the correct performance of any work. <br><br>  An example from Denis Kaplunov‚Äôs studio for anyone working with advertising texts.  In return for an email address, you receive check sheets for writing the texts of email newsletters, cases, the home page of the site, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dad/5b8/871/dad5b88719d04cf89ce8d3383ce2809a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04b/9a1/923/04b9a192310f4cd18c31e3ccf78b564a.jpg"><br><br><h3>  No. 5 Infographics </h3><br>  Infographics - this is a visual presentation of information, and all that a person perceives through the visual channel, it is easier for him to assimilate and remember. <br><br>  If you are posting articles from your blog, as far as possible, alternate articles with infographics. <br><br>  Good infographics should be: <br><br>  - useful; <br>  - clear; <br>  - visually attractive. <br><br>  Below is an example of a newsletter with infographics, the theme of which is: "10 steps to start your own business, having full employment." <br><br>  In the letter you will read about the author of infographics and about his experience in large companies.  There is also a small picture preview of the infographic itself, and a list of what you learn from it.  All this together increases the chances of downloading. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/441/dd4/fc3/441dd4fc3b2a4e1e87e734ff9dd7bc39.jpg"><br><br><h3>  ‚Ññ6 Raffle </h3><br>  People like to try their luck in the hope of getting something for free.  Below you see the newsletter from Yoga Journal, which offers to win a free course from the master. <br><br>  There is nothing superfluous in the letter: only a brief description of the course and two ‚ÄúEnter and win‚Äù buttons, with a transition to the target site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/871/d6c/1f3/871d6c1f3bfd4ae19c27dae5d25d2a5d.jpg"><br><br><h3>  No. 7 Discount Coupon </h3><br>  A lead magnet in the form of a discount coupon is used both to collect addresses and to heat leads. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51d/a12/1b3/51da121b381c4aa588946a412d268486.jpg"><br><br><h3>  No. 8 Free Trial </h3><br>  There are several options for how to test drive your product.  You can set a free trial period, the duration of which you consider sufficient for review.  And you can make a free basic version, in which additional features are included in the paid package. <br><br>  HootSuite offers the whole 60 days of using the professional version.  The letter lists all its advantages, the standard price, and the offer is valid only until the end of the day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/020/a8c/2bc/020a8c2bc69343debb135d7e0dd1e315.jpg"><br><br><h3>  No. 9 Video </h3><br>  And again an example of distribution from Product Psychology.  This time, the letter proposes to buy tickets for the conference.  The video from last year‚Äôs conference is used as a lead magnet.  In it, speakers from Google Ventures tell how to create a prototype in 5 days and test any idea. <br><br>  If you were inspired to create such a lead magnet, read our article on <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sendpulse/blog/319964/">how best to use video in email</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55b/ca5/f90/55bca5f90abb480eb694d25109d6680e.jpg"><br><br>  By and large, anything can become a lead magnet, if it is useful, relevant, solves the problem of users and leads to the desired target action. <br><br>  Therefore, turn on creativity and create lead magnets that magnetise. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320644/</a></p>
