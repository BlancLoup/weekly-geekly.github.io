The conference was held at the Korston Hotel.  The conference gathered more than 900 participants from 80 cities of Russia.  At the conference 60 reports were heard, a large number of thematic stands were presented in the demo zone. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  The format of the conference has already become familiar.  Zero day - May 24 - the day of arrival of the guests, followed by two days of fruitful work of the conference. </p><br><p>  For participants who were able to arrive on May 24, there was an opportunity to register and take part in two events to choose from ‚ÄúA sightseeing tour of the city of Kazan‚Äù or participate in a master class from <b>the Academy of Information Systems company</b> on the topic ‚ÄúInvestigating Information Security Incidents‚Äù.  Despite the fact that the announced master class still had the format of a regular presentation, it was truly useful and relevant for its participants.  Thanks to not only AIS expert <b>Zyuzin Mikhail</b> , the speaker of the event, but also to the experienced participants of the session, a constructive discussion arose during the session, which made it possible to disassemble various nuances of the correct course of action when preparing a legally correct evidence base in investigating cybercrime. </p><br><p>  The following issues were addressed during the master class: <br><br></p><ul><li>  Examples and procedures for responding to information security incidents; </li><li>  The procedure for the investigation of computer crimes; </li><li>  Interaction with law enforcement agencies; </li><li>  Legally correct collection of evidence. </li></ul><br><p></p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/77a/058/119/77a058119fae4113b523976cfa76768b.jpg" alt="AIS"></div><br><p>  Zero day ended with a welcome dinner from the organizers of the conference in the PETZOLD craft brewery. </p><br><br><p>  And finally, on May 25, the grand opening of the conference took place in the huge Ballroom of the Korston Hotel. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/855/b92/9f2/855b929f2a0c458a80efc5c0bd18dc69.jpg"></div>
