  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Application for drawing under the Android</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A month and a half ago, I already published a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/android/133561/">topic</a> about the VoytPaint application.  Now I want to tell a little what happened next and how the application developed these six weeks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00f/646/be0/00f646be0f4c9b5c5625468916eed453.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  About the first reviews </h1><br>  I will begin, perhaps, with the first reviews of the article, the first user reviews on the market, my friends, people on the forums, letters to the mail and so on.  The general opinion in two words could be expressed as ‚Äúnot bad, but.‚Äù  The main trends were: <br><br>  1. not bad, but I need such an application for a child, and you have it too complicated for children. <br>  I generally agreed with this argument, I wanted to make the application as simple as possible, but it turned out to be not very simple due to the increase in functionality.  After such reviews, the first impulse was to make a very simple, but very beautiful application for children, and I already did some concept VoytPaintKids.  But what to do with it?  It is pointless to insert advertising into it, because if a child, if he clicks on it, then by chance, is it somehow unfair to be paid?  - also doubtful, since there would be no free version, and you won‚Äôt try the application, there was only one option - to release it completely free and without limitations, purely as a PR to the main application, most likely I‚Äôll do it when I‚Äôve got enough time to finish it.  And most importantly, there were a few positive reviews just about the fact that a person liked this application precisely because it was not for children (for the market is packed to capacity).

      2. not bad, but I want to open the photo from the device and remove the restriction on the size of the drawn picture 480 * 480 (for the free version, the paid size of the picture is 1280 * 1280 and you can open the photo from the device).  Well, here I unconditionally removed these restrictions, for example, opening photos makes the program interesting not only for those who want to draw, but also for those who want to process photos. <br><br>  3. not bad, but I want layers.  Here, perhaps, the most difficult, to implement the layers in such an application is rather difficult technically, since the android only has 16MB of RAM per application, a picture of 1280 * 1280, the ‚Äúundo / redo‚Äù function, and even the layers will be extremely hard to fit; when adding layers you will need to limit the functionality.  And the most important thing is that it will completely complicate the interface.  In the end, I think about layers. <br><br><h1>  What has changed in the program </h1><br>  In addition to the previously mentioned changes: removing restrictions on the size of the picture and opening photos from the device, the cost of the paid application was reduced to 0.99, a number of bugs were fixed (they oddly enough turned out to be small), a balloon was fixed (now it draws beautifully), an alpha channel is added colors, added a blur tool (aka ‚Äúfinger‚Äù), added a black and white filter.  And we also made a promo video with the designer: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjANTJfB-Gw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiZ4lXLY14F3g_T8ZFjhE2zflx0Qg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  tablet Acer Iconia. <br><br><h1>  What is planned </h1><br>  In the near future, adding filters to make the program convenient for photo editing, you can add cut \ copy \ paste, and of course reflections on layers, + your suggestions. <br><br><h1>  Statistics </h1><br>  1. spent on advertising $ 450 (just do a story about the promotion of the application (and by the way some technical issues of implementation) deserves a separate post) <br><br>  2. free application: <br>  installations: 3526 <br>  Users: 1722 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e00/df6/069/e00df6069bec76a9d2cfc54fca2559c1.png"><br><br>  no less curious and the "composition of the participating countries" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d13/653/07f/d1365307fdd3dc9a8eb0b0d764138b7d.png"><br><br>  The application earned advertising $ 18.51 <br><br>  3. paid application: <br>  a whole month (the whole of December) there was no race (only my test was one), but from the beginning of January!
