  <section class="page js-page"><h1>FAQ: opening an account for an LLC in the PayPal payment system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now I want to talk about how to open an account for an LLC in the PayPal payment system.  Everyone already knows that this payment system allows you to withdraw funds in rubles to the accounts of Russian banks, but not everyone knows how to connect it and what is needed for this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, you already have a bank account, there are scans of the founders' passports (page with photo and registration), extracts from the register, OGRN, TIN, scan document (maximum file size should not exceed 500kb), which describes the business model, organization goals , and how PayPal will be used. <br><br>  This payment system asks to upload scans of documents in a bonded form; any free photo editor will be suitable for this task. <br><br>  Your first action will be registration on PayPal.com (the company opened a daughter in Russia in 2013 and does not fall under FZ 149), after which you will need to provide the payment system with additional information about your organization.  As a confirmation of your company's current account, PayPal will send you a penny amount divided into two parts.  The bank can combine this void payment and you will not be able to activate it, since you cannot enter the exact values ‚Äã‚Äãrequested by the system.  Immediately after you received a request for authorization from the payment system, in the form of this payment, you need to call PayPal support service, introduce yourself and name the amount that came to the account, and it will be immediately confirmed. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      After the initial registration and confirmation of the account, you will find out that access to your account is limited (you cannot receive and send funds), to remove this restriction, you will be prompted to switch to a paypal-merchant, you will need to provide your bank account details there, describe its activities, and provide personal data of its owners. <br><br>  Among other data that you need to download, will be scanned account statements.  To do this, you go to the bank, request it, and after 15 minutes you will receive an expanded statement of the account, which also includes OGRN, TIN, KPP, BIK of the bank, its seal, and also OGRN TIN of your organization (for the entire period of the account existence). <br><br>  Then, you will need to provide information about the account holder.  Everything is simple here: you will need to scan the pages of your passport with a photo and registration. <br><br>  The final step will be to provide information about your company, its goals, the presence of beneficiaries in it (people owning 25% of the company and more), and providing a written power of attorney for additional users who have the right to work with the account.  It should be noted that one person can open an LLC, but the state will regard it as a society, it smacks of schizophrenia. <br><br>  PayPal does not allow you to open an account for an LLC without additional users, so if you are the only founder, you will need to issue a written power of attorney, for example, to your accountant and scan it.  For all additional users need to download a scan of the passport. <br><br>  If the activity of your company does not require a license, then you must put ‚Äúyes‚Äù in the column of the license and dial the license number 00000, date of issue of the license, like any date in the format dd.mm.yyyy.  You will be asked to download a license. <br><br>  You will download a scan of a document describing the business model, organization goals, and how PayPal will be used.  The document must contain the signature of the CEO and the seal of the organization. <br><br>  Finally, upload a written power of attorney for each additional user with permission to make financial transactions on the account.  Your account is a registered email, in the power of attorney you need to specify it.  Add users in the wallet.  Path: "my account - profile - my settings - user management - add user". <br><br>  If everything is done correctly, the connection will take no more than 14 days, which in my experience is very fast. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294038/</a></p>
