The topics raised in the conversation turned out to be so burning that the discussion dragged on for 3 hours.  In this article I will try to recreate the smear for the smear image of the modern IT field (naturally through the prism of the perception of Yandex). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Note: all of the following has been recorded from the words of Eugene Shkuratova, and after it has been previously passed through itself. <br><br>  <b>Dossier on specialist:</b>

      Evgenia Shkuratova <br><br>  Head of the recruitment department of Yandex <br><br>  Previously worked at Delpiko, ITONLINE GROUP <br><br>  By her own admission, the book on recruitment does not read, guided by real experience. <br><br>  <b>Tili-tili-dough!</b> <br><br>  Evgenia Shkuratova at the very beginning of the discussion (and later also) repeated: ‚ÄúGuys, understand, find a job, how to get married!‚Äù.  At first, I confess, I did not immediately understand why such a comparison was.  However, Evgenia explained that the basis for the choice of work, as well as the basis for choosing a satellite (s) of life, is the need for comfortable human relations, recognition and harmony with oneself.  When choosing a place, you should not be guided by the brand and salary, but by your interests.  It is also important that these interests coincide with the interests of the potential employer.  Do not forget that there are companies focused on results, and there are - on the process (according to Eugene, Yandex belongs to the first category).  Listen to yourself very carefully when you choose where to go next! <br><br>  <b>I would go to Yandex.</b>  <b>Let them teach me!</b> <br><br>  It‚Äôs no secret that it‚Äôs both prestigious and interesting to get into such a large domestic company as Yandex ... And promising!  In turn, Yandex is thinking about prospects and preparing ‚Äúhands and heads for growth‚Äù by launching several educational programs in such higher educational institutions as MIPT, MEPI and SU-HSE. <br><br>  <b>Business card</b> <br><br>  If for some reason you did not get into one of the Yandex programs, then you will have to somehow charm the hr-manager, first with your resume and then at the interview.  To get to this interview, you have to pretty sweat, creating a short, but fully revealing your skills and talents resume. <br><br>  Summary of IT-specialist should contain the following items: <br><br>  1) a list of technologies that you own; <br><br>  2) a portfolio of implemented projects with an indication of your role in them, responsibilities, results and a link to the project website, if one exists; <br><br>  3) links to your profile in professional social networks (for example, LinkedIn and Brain Bench) <br><br>  Maybe the question is how to assess your knowledge in a particular area.  Look, for example, in My Circle, the qualifications of the employees of the company to which you are going to get employed, or the specialists of your profile and compare them with yours.  Evaluate your skills and abilities as a percentage of what you‚Äôve taken and assign each item the category ‚Äúbeginner level‚Äù, ‚Äúmedium level‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh level‚Äù. <br><br>  Eugene paid special attention to the now popular section ‚ÄúPersonal qualities‚Äù.  Today it is fashionable to write about manic responsibility, transcendent ambition and over-learning.  Alas, I‚Äôm grieving you - according to the head of the Yandex recruitment department, such personal qualities will not only help you to find a desired position, but rather harm.  The general advice was this - if nothing comes to the head except the bored common words (this does not mean that you have to write something exotic!), Then this section is better not to add to the resume.  Better to drop a few words about your interests - this will better reveal you as a person. <br><br>  Before sending a resume to the company, indicate the position for which you are applying, and the desired salary (more about it later). <br><br>  <b>Show me your resume and I will tell you who you are</b> <br><br>  You have sent a resume to the company, and now you have to wait ... And at this time your essay on the topic "What I spent X years of my life" begins to study the HR-manager.  What will he (or rather, she) pay attention to first?  When considering your candidacy as a candidate for a particular position, they will look at your experience with a particular technology, evaluate your roles in the listed projects and try to understand whether you have the necessary qualities or not. <br><br>  <b>I will recognize the dear by ...</b> <br><br>  And so the stars have developed successfully, and you are at the interview.  To win the sympathy of a specialist from the company, you need to show a genuine, almost childish (that is, completely sincere and lively) interest in the IT market and the Internet.  You will also be noted if you show fanaticism about your hobbies and interests that intersect directly with the interests of the company.  And, finally, the most important thing - "burning" eyes!  All of the above you will have to show for the most part with the help of these ‚Äúburning‚Äù eyes!  No one can really explain how this is, but it is believed that these eyes cannot be missed!  =) <br><br>  <b>HR manager = hunter?</b> <br><br>  In this place I will make a small lyrical digression and describe a little the situation with the selection of high-level specialists. <br><br>  Despite the fact that we were told in a secret conversation that ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù does not take PMs and top managers from the outside, they confirmed that the company has such a phenomenon as hunting. <br><br>  Head hunting (head hunting) - ‚Äúhunting‚Äù for a specific specialist and his enticement to the company (‚Äúhunting for the head‚Äù - a literal translation from English). <br><br>  Most often, this method is used when you need to find a specialist with a rare specialty (for example, you need a smart usability).  The company makes some order and transfers it to the main hr-specialist, and here he must apply all his talents and skills to get the best of the best!  ‚ÄúMarriage‚Äù will take place if you in another company, congenial to the bloodhound company, were able to give a good account of yourself, and stories about your exploits on the working field of battle run ahead of you, plunging everyone into awesome horror! <br><br>  <b>Money, money, money!</b> <br><br>  So, in the end he left, probably, the most burning topic in the framework of employment.  Of course, it will be about salary.  As noted earlier, the salary that you are applying for is definitely worth writing in your resume (and this applies not only to the device in Yandex or, in general, to the IT environment).  To underestimate the figure of the desired amount, because you are yesterday's student, or overestimate it, because you consider yourself to be a super professional (all of a sudden it is not confirmed by your resume), it‚Äôs not worth it, because during the interview you will have to repeat it without blushing and turning pale!  During the conversation, Eugenia explained that it is better to substantiate the chosen level of salary with a calm, confident voice, and it is even possible to honestly admit that it is SUCH MONEY that is required to, for example, rent an apartment itself.  And the hr-manager in this case will try to listen to you, because the "issue price" can poison anyone's existence, and, according to our guest, Yandex is interested, like no other, in the comfortable living and working conditions of its employees. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93108/</a></p>
