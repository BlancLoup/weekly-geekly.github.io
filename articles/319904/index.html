True, some projects look sometimes very unusual, if not to say that fantastic.  The other day, two telecommunications giants - Microsoft and Google presented two projects of the newest data centers.  One thing unites these projects - water. <br><br>  Otherwise they are different.  So, Microsoft Corporation patents an underwater data center, and with an artificial reef.  And Google is developing a project of a floating data center, driven by kites.  Let's see what these projects are and what they can be used for. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Microsoft and its underwater data center </h3><br>  Microsoft, like many other large telecommunications companies of our time, is trying to look as green as possible, that is, to be environmentally friendly.  This is one of the reasons that prompted the corporation to develop a project of an underwater data center with an artificial reef.  Here, according to the developers, almost zero environmental impact and the ability to make money are combined.

The reasons that lead to this result are very different.  Sometimes it is an infection, but most often it is about global warming and changes in acidity and some other parameters of seawater. <br><br>  In order to somehow compensate for the extinction of old reefs, people began to try to create a suitable environment for the formation of new ones.  For this purpose, a variety of methods and objects are used, including submerged cargo ships.  But such objects are not optimal for the specified purpose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b32/bdf/11c/b32bdf11c44f18ecaf18085819dcaaa3.jpg" width="800"><br><br>  Microsoft has proposed its own solution - it is a modular data center, which will serve as the basis for the formation of coral "thickets".  According to experts, the excess heat emitted by the data center will contribute to attracting the inhabitants of the shelf.  The developers of the company have provided another move, which will allow sea creatures to gain a foothold in the location of the underwater data center.  These are nutrients that will be distributed using special tools. <br><br>  Microsoft already has experience in using water depths as a tool for cooling data center equipment.  So, several months ago, the corporation announced the successful testing of an underwater container with network equipment located there.  Now it is decided to scale the project.  To ensure that the data center does not demolish undercurrents, the modules will be fixed with special anchors.  The depth of the data centers will be sufficient so that they are not damaged as a result of exposure to factors such as hurricanes or storms. <br><br>  According to the company, a data center of this type is a few dozen hermetically sealed containers.  Between themselves, they will be connected by network and energy channels, which will allow DCs to work as a single system.  If necessary, all containers or parts can be lifted to the surface for maintenance.  Energy such an object will receive from the waves, currents and tides.  But it will be one of the sources of electricity, the rest will have to be delivered in the usual way - by cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b06/05b/181/b0605b181625b56bf76826175fcb5302.jpg" width="800"><br><br>  Of course, the proposed design is also not perfect.  After all, the underwater data center, except for waves and hurricanes, can be damaged as a result of exposure to a large number of factors.  These include direct sabotage, accidents involving underwater or surface ships, damage to containers by marine animals, and man-made debris on coolers (radiators). <br><br>  At the same time, the engineers of the corporation provided several ways to avoid unwanted problems.  Among others - the detection of unauthorized physical intrusion.  Such a system will consist of a large number of different kinds of sensors and sensors. <br><br><h3>  And what about Google? </h3><br>  Google, in contrast to Microsoft, is not going to pile up coral reefs.  Instead, the company plans to launch its data centers on a long voyage in order to ensure that there are no complaints from regulators from different countries about the data stored on their servers.  Of course, this is just a fantasy, but if the data center is placed in neutral waters, then everything can be.  Perhaps the company will be able to implement their plans thanks to their new project to create data centers, driven by kites.  The company received such a patent at the end of last year. <br><br>  As for the floating data centers themselves, there is nothing particularly new here - the same Nautilus Data Technologies company plans to launch the first such data center on water this year.  At Google, we went further and decided to create an original movement system for barges - data centers. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q8WpoIYPw2k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The meaning of the project is to provide a floating data center with wind energy.  It will generate huge kites that are high above the surface of the ocean.  At this altitude, the winds blow constantly, so there will be no problems in the generation of electricity.  In addition, kite-generators will also put ships in motion. <br><br>  Some time ago, Google was engaged in the development of floating data centers, perhaps this experience will be implemented in the new project.  Cooling here, as in the case of the Microsoft project, will be done using seawater.  This will save a significant amount of energy.  Despite the fact that the company will receive electricity at a low price (the cost of energy, unfortunately, is still unknown), it will still have to save. <br><br>  The generated electricity will be accumulated in a special system, from where energy can be taken as needed.  Well, the barges with data centers on board can be moved around the World Ocean. <br><br>  How realistic are both projects?  Who knows.  So far, all this is only in the state of the concept, although companies have received patents for their developments.  But, as we know, modern corporations sometimes quickly realize what seemed absolutely fantastic just yesterday.  So it only remains to wait. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319904/</a></p>
