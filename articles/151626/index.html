The book was published over a year ago.  And, nevertheless, we want to draw your attention to it.  There are one-day books.  There is a classic.  And there are books that will become classics, or at least will live long.  It just takes time.  The book should stand out like a good brandy.  For 1.5 years this book has withstood 4 copies.  And continues to sell well.  I hope you enjoy it. <br><br><h4>  Abstract of the edition </h4><br>  In the world, constantly someone faces the same programming problems that arise with you.  Many developers solve completely identical tasks and find similar solutions.  If you do not want to reinvent the wheel, use ready-made design patterns (patterns) that this book is dedicated to.  Patterns appeared because many developers were looking for ways to increase the flexibility and reuse of their programs.  The solutions found are embodied in a concise and easily applicable form in practice.  A special feature of this publication is a unique way of presenting the material, highlighting the ‚ÄúHead First‚Äù series of O'Reilly publishing house in a series of many boring books on programming.  The book will be interesting to a wide range of web developers, from beginners to professionals who want to master the work with design patterns. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Opinion </h4><br>  My initial attitude towards this book was very skeptical.  For some reason, the Head First series was associated with the ‚ÄúLearn Something in 24 Hours‚Äù series, but it changed a lot when I looked at the number of positive reviews on this book on various sites, including the notorious stackoverflow.  There, in general, this book is among the ten most famous and popular books and is considered the most preferred source for exploring the topic of design patterns.  At the same time, no one diminishes the merits of the "gang of four", but many recognize that from the point of view of teaching this topic, the book by Erich Gamma and the company is not the best option due to excessive dryness of presentation.

      I met only the top ten pages available on the publisher‚Äôs website, but I have a very positive impression of the work of local translators.  As for the content of the book, even a quick acquaintance is enough to understand the reason for such a huge number of positive reviews.  The book feels fundamentally different approach to the presentation of the material: if the gang of four is more like a reference book, then this book is a textbook in which the reader is given tasks that are solved, primarily from the point of view of the PLO canons, and then they are tied to this decision patterns.  In addition, the book is just a huge number of drawings, most of which are very funny, and funny in the good sense of the word;  rather, they help to convey the ideas of the authors, rather than distract and annoy them, so the volume of 650 pages should not scare you, because the book is even read in the original very quickly and easily. <br><br>  <a href="http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.com/2011/03/announce-32011.html">Sergey Teplyakov</a> <br><br>  It is very nice when specialists like our books. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144995/">And another good review about the book</a> <br><br>  Book on <a href="http://www.piter.com/book.phtml%3F978545900435">Piter.com</a> <br>  Book on <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/6108824/">Ozon.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151626/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151626/</a></p>
