      Why did I start with a story about a hungry child?  Yes, because this is exactly what our whole world looks like, in which a multitude of problems simply have not been fully heard and understood by those who always act strictly according to the canons and patterns, without even trying to think about what comes from it want others.  <i>‚ÄúIf a child whimpers - give him a tablet, if problems in the economy - you need to increase repression, if you order a website - then you need to immediately start drawing a banner on the main page‚Äù</i> - these and other absurd things that are firmly rooted in our mind and bring only harm to society . <br><br>  Suppose someone had a toothache.  He could go, quickly put a small filling at once and thereby save himself from the problem forever;  but instead he takes pills that reduce toothache every day, and it seems to him that the problem has already been solved.  It seems so exactly up to that very time, until you have to remove the entire tooth, cutting the gum. <br><br>  The modern work of the interface illustrator (UI \ UX designer) over endless button rounding and micro-animation quality is similar to these pain pills - they do not solve the original problem of a person in any way, but entertain and brighten up a little leisure, allowing the problem hidden deep inside to swell and festering more and more. This is the very pain-relieving design when we are painting the virtual screen more brightly, behind which lies a man writhing in the throes of pain, who pulls out a rotten tooth.  And this is just cruel, in my opinion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e17/35c/796/e1735c79617aa7f5c85df6e2a89dcb2a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>People don't need design anymore, they need solutions.</b> <br><br>  We all know how to hate a long and painful search for a lost thing.  It is always stressful, and it accumulates anger like an avalanche-like grudge against oneself and those around you, and not at all wanting to show up.  However, this search, as one of the stressful states, is today put at the forefront of all processes on the Internet: almost everything begins with the search, and it even seems to us that this is normal and natural.  It seems to us so smoothly until we ourselves lose our passport and at the prompt we get a list of a thousand pages (even if beautifully decorated - backgrounds, fonts, shadows) of all those places where it could be found.  Only then we will be able to fully experience all the feelings and emotions of those users, for whom we also create complex scenarios of searching and searching for options. <br><br>  <b>Yes, people do not need online shopping</b> <br><br>  In fact, people do not like to buy - they want to take and use, and the buying process is a necessary evil, those ‚Äúcrutches‚Äù that you have to agree on, since nothing better can be invented.  But is it not possible?  That Uber refused the act of payment during the trip - and won.  They removed the unpleasant process to people - and got loyal customers.  But this is not the end, because you can constantly get rid of unnecessary entities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/691/149/160/6911491601284a47d612751ef4920803.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Even the choice of goods on the shelf of several similar ones has always been stressful for a person.  It turns out that by namyavshis with the search for the desired site, the user moves to a new painful process - the choice of goods.  So his stress increases every second, and it‚Äôs simply not possible to talk seriously about empathy.  Choose and make decisions, search and order - hell, yes you make it really work! <br><br>  Today, any purchase on the Internet is really hard and ungrateful work, for which the buyer then also pays the money.  Absurd, but generally accepted.  And the wrong decision is constantly self-reproducing itself. <br><br>  If someone today wants to do business on low-cost smartphones, then he will definitely make a pattern decision about creating another standard online store in runet with a standard basket and delivery, menus and payment through a bank card.  This is the same hackneyed way, when everyone is frankly too lazy to ponder and listen to the true request of their client.  This is how, without even thinking about a real human need, everyone is in a hurry to order another web studio next web site, add more of some secret usability there, and then diligently push it in the crowd of their own clones in search results. <br><br>  <i>- Mom, can I have some food?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Well, go turn on the computer and spend forty minutes of your precious and unique life on filling out an application for me and filling in the address.</i>  <i>And if you make a mistake in registration - then you start all over again.</i> <br><br>  But is it possible otherwise?  Of course.  So, we have a lot of good smartphones and the desire to become rich and successful.  We go out into the street and distribute them all to people just like that, for free, just hand them over to those who need these phones most and who still cannot afford them.  Then we will draw time, let it play and get used, wait for the moment when people transfer all their personal contacts, install games and applications, and then, having created the most loyal customers, we will start earning on the monthly payment for using the device, which will be abandoned at once already hard and uncomfortable. <br><br>  Stress is not the acquisition, but the deprivation of the goods - that‚Äôs where for many years all psychologists of the world have been urging to turn the eyes of modern innovators. <br><br>  By the way, exactly the same thing is suitable for food - it is reasonable to feed the hungry first, and only then ask for money from him, because a well-fed person is much kinder and more likely to be generous with tips after a good dinner.  The restaurateurs realized this 200 years ago, and in web design, so far all this is still the most advanced breakthrough and discovery.  Subscribing to 10 deliveries at your favorite pizzeria with monthly payment is the same convenient and pleasant.  He ate 10 times - and paid only once and in bulk, now and minus 9 extra operations.  This is what real design thinking looks like, which is taught from the first semester of any course in sociology / psychology at any humanitarian university, but for some reason they are not taught in the British. <br><br>  All that is needed in any business is regular monthly payments, and the ability to promote within your own service system - product offers from your partners.  "And if they do not take - turn off the gas" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/417/a23/44d/417a2344d5dcddac61c6f3a58dba9331.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Such an approach would be beneficial to all - after all, in fact, this is a replacement for a purchase on credit, but without the intermediation of a bank, when each of us pays a certain monthly rent for using a TV and fridge, telephone and clothes (given its depreciation, of course) .  Start with the fact that dress and feed, and not to force to search and choose.  Can anything sound more reasonable? <br><br>  <b>People do not dream to spend life in the "Personal Account"</b> <br><br>  So, having designed several dozens of payment applications and various personal accounts, including for banks, I was constantly amazed - how much everyone believed in the world that humanity urgently needed numbered flat pieces of plastic to make their payments.  Moreover, it is believed that self-respecting men of such plastic rectangles should have about a dozen, and each of them should be clearly tied to a single algorithm - one for airline tickets, the other for taverns, the third for clothing stores, the twentieth for a trip to the subway.  And no one ever bothered to find out from an ordinary person, and how many new cards should he add monthly to his wallet for complete happiness: another ten, twenty, or maybe a hundred? <br><br>  Yes, none.  None of sensible people will want in 2-3 years to carry with them a whole ton of your plastic, while keeping in mind the most complicated algorithm of their payments: what and where is more convenient to use, so that the points, discounts and tanchiki I‚Äôve saved are everywhere.  It is impossible to err in this case, and the bonuses disappear.  It is cruel to think so about the comfort of your own clients. <br><br>  Any person actually dreams about making all his life operations (including online payments), having only his own body and common sense, and not carrying any more cards and gadgets with him (after all, it was originally intended by nature ). <br><br>  All that is needed to complete a transaction is to identify the customer and link his person to the electronic account.  This means that not the next hundred thousandth application for iPhones will help everyone, but the simple ‚ÄúIf-then‚Äù algorithm, with which he himself will choose the most suitable bonus program now, cast the necessary points there, based on the rules of a specific customer loyalty program prescribed in advance. <br><br>  And all that is needed from me is my body, and nothing more.  You can attach the pupil or even spit with saliva from the DNA on the electrode - and calmly go on, without jerking your fingers across the screens.  I even have a slogan: <b>‚ÄúPay - just spit!‚Äù</b> , Which I will sell to Tinkoffff-Bank in 15 years, when the current ‚ÄúUser Cabinets‚Äù will be replaced with an understanding of the primary needs of their client, and the designers will stop copying from each other unsuccessful temporary solutions - stiffened with Dribbbla. <br><br>  <b>Ordinary people are not at all delighted with the geometric growth of information.</b> <br><br>  Many today are enthusiastically broadcasting about the constant growth of information and with a positive prediction about the imminent coming of the era of Big Data.  Truly they do not know what they are doing.  The abundance of information is evil in its purest form.  Do not believe? <br><br>  Find a married man.  And not just married, but married for over 20 years.  And ask him how he likes the habit of his wife for 20 years, from day to day, incessantly scoring with his verbal and emotional flow of information his whole life.  And then happily and with optimism sell him the idea that in another 5 years her verbal flow will grow by another 2-3 times and just watch the reaction of the interlocutor.  So you will know the truth about the true importance of information for a person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b21/8b3/a5b/b218b3a5b68914145d18dd1699eedd88.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It turns out that people do not need information as such when moving along the route of their fate.  For example, all these interactive maps with a complete map of roads, intersections and parks are absolutely unnecessary.  Ordinary people need a simple one-byte understanding of the fact that the office they need is located opposite the yellow brick house with the sign ‚ÄúWorld of Knitwear‚Äù, and at what stop you need to get out.  And that‚Äôs it, the brain doesn‚Äôt need anything else, all the other illustrations and animated menus are the same ‚Äúold talkative wife‚Äù who said a lot of superfluous, but didn‚Äôt tell the main thing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/02b/a4f/c49/02ba4fc49e81eb03197e865255cfb11f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>What can you learn by starting to listen to what ordinary users say?</b> <br><br>  People do not need air tickets - they need sun and sea; <br>  People do not need transport - they need walking distance of everything, and the rest of the time (when they are not in a hurry) - they just want to walk in the park; <br>  People do not need search engines, banners and websites - they just sometimes want to use some things.  And some more often, and others only a couple of times in their lives; <br>  People do not even need even houses and apartments.  Ideally, a person just needs a comfortable place to relax, sleep and rest, spend an evening with the family and rejuvenate. <br><br>  <b>Solve technology, not design</b> <br><br>  Suppose if technology suddenly appears tomorrow, providing each person with a balloon home in which you can sleep, have a snack and watch your favorite TV series anywhere and anytime, then blow it off, put it in your bag and continue your endless journey through the world then the construction and mortgage lending market will collapse in such a way that 2008 will seem like only a small sneeze. <br><br>  And then no design will save typical websites of any housing complexes from oblivion and the sands of history, despite all the quality of their drawing. <br><br>  All stupidly gain portable ball houses with Avito that hang in the air and give every inhabitant of the Earth comfort, peace and their own individual space, saving everyone from having to transfer their body from the Khrushchev to the place of work, and then back to a place of rest and lodging for the night, spending up to a third of all the life we ‚Äã‚Äãhave been given. <br><br>  All today's corporations, businesses, websites are successful simply because at this second there is no simpler and cheaper technology to solve a human problem. <br><br>  Today, the Internet has ceased to be the flagship of innovation, it no longer serves as cutting-edge ideas and innovations, but is a tool for controlling and managing the masses, a system for transmitting a huge amount of unnecessary information around the clock, and a means for the constant reproduction of redundant entities.  The task of the article is to remind us all that the ‚Äútalkative wife‚Äù once grumbled less, did not knock the secret services, and was still able to produce a solution for almost any perennial problem of humanity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391949/</a></p>
