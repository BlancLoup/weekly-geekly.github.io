In this post, there will be no thoughtful anboxing - I got the device in my hands, as they say, ready.  Arriving at the new Sony Ericsson office in the ‚Äúcity of skyscrapers‚Äù Moscow City, I just received the phone as is, without packaging and accessories.  From the ship to the ball.  It was then that I was glad once again that the connectors for charging modern phones are unified.  Well, since the format of acquaintance with the apparatus did not involve long ceremonies, then I will not delay the introduction - to the point. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/124506/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/df704395/224acfb9/23f2dc2e/71afc5cc.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>In natural habitat</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The impression of the device in the hands is like a jewelry thing.  This is facilitated, firstly, by subtle, graceful forms with clearly defined edges, secondly, an excellent assembly - no backlash, tightly knit "brick", and, thirdly - the screen.  The screen parameters (like the whole ‚Äúiron‚Äù part) are similar to those of the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù <b>Sony Ericsson Xperia arc</b> - the same 854x480 pixels placed on the capacitive screen.  But the screen size is almost an inch smaller - 3.3 "in ray versus 4.2" in arc.  That is, the same amount of information fits on both screens, so this is only a question of size.  In addition, due to the higher density of pixels per inch, the Xperia ray screen looks even slightly brighter and more contrast than the arc.  This is especially noticeable when two phones lie side by side, with the same color theme:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c3682282/736ce3db/ce5e20d7/7b6df514.jpg"><br><br>  When these two devices are next to each other, the other is also noticeable: outwardly, the ray is in no way inferior to the flagship and looks even, for my taste, more elegant.  Amazingly, the sharp figure of the ray makes one of the most beautiful phones of the year look like an awkward giant by comparison: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3bd20f01/fc13f596/f347baf4/d0b6af70.jpg"><br><br>  The phone is available in four body colors - black, white, gold and pink.  However, I would not call pink (pink) - this is not a nasty puppet color, but rather a rich shade of red rather.  The choice of serious girls or boys without complexes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/eef8b3f6/d40881f1/b6a73b7e/72b4a7b6.jpg"><br><br>  However, I got a golden device for the test.  It is also glamorous, but the reason for the choice was rather prosaic - of all the four test samples available at the Sony Ericsson Moscow office, only Gold had the final firmware. <br><br>  In addition to its own lid, the phone is painted in a ‚Äútitle color‚Äù even along the edge, so it‚Äôs not possible to simply replace the lid with a different color just like a hooligan.  It is removed by one picking with a nail in a hollow on the bottom end.  Shooting and dressing her is also a pleasure.  There is nothing special under the lid, but I appreciated the quality of the assembly in the process of picking in the insides of the apparatus on the top five. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/83df0bf0/bbadd505/87c7fab5/3305ec18.jpg"><br>  <i>On the test phone, there was a 2 gig card, but there will be a package with 4 GB of memory available</i> <br><br>  Headphone jack and power button located on the top, MicroUSB-connector - on the left side above, "volume rocker" on the right. <br><br>  The frontal part of the phone is almost completely closed with a piece of mineral glass, under which two of the three main buttons (‚ÄúBack‚Äù and ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù) were hidden - they are now sensory.  This solution was first used most recently on the <b>Sony Ericsson Xperia mini</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ba42c409/81dc24b6/1fe75b61/cb978344.jpg"><br>  <i>Phone thickness - 9.4 mm</i> <br><br>  The only remaining "real" Home button also plays the role of a stylish decorative element - with its arched shape it echoes the smiley on the back panel, and when charging the arc is highlighted with a red light when the charge is low and green when it is high. <br><br><h4>  Small spool but precious </h4><br>  Inside - Android 2.3 and a full gentleman's suite of applications familiar from other models of this year‚Äôs company.  But one useful program is still only on Xperia ray - WalkMate pedometer.  It works well, regularly counting the number of steps.  By the way, I never thought that you could walk 10,000 steps so quickly.  The only pity is that this program will not appear in the Market - so far it is the exclusive privilege of Xperia ray, on other smartphones of the company it may appear only with updates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a182a1c4/278162bf/d012c31e/bc43fedf.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1de796cf/05794c03/f573f28d/bf69e73c.jpg"><br><br>  Another interesting and useful feature is the power saving mode.  With one click, you can switch the phone from ‚Äúeat‚Äù to ‚Äúnot eat‚Äù.  Of course, the nuances - where not to eat at all, and where a bit you can - are customizable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f62afe35/1a4ebee6/d48f9224/2c1604bb.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/749fd805/c600811b/a4c6ec5a/4652c3b5.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the battery keeps well.  A capacity of 1500 mAh made it possible to survive a number that was deadly for most Androids from "morning to evening in active use mode". <br><br>  Standard multimedia capabilities of the device (including support for 3D games, radio) are strongly supported by the front camera, which is suitable for practicing the ‚Äúself portrait‚Äù genre or, as we wrote recently, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/123108/">using Skype video calls</a> .  And finally, a pre-installed Twitter client appeared. <br><br>  The main camera is identical to the camera Sony Ericsson Xperia arc: the same 8.1 MP + technology improved shooting in low light conditions Exmor R. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Old-school appearance, albeit super modern, phone, leads me to strange thoughts.  Let him formally, for stuffing and for belonging to the Xperia clan, he is a smartphone, but for some reason he doesn‚Äôt cause me to associate with hybrid descendants of ordinary phones and PDAs.  As I already wrote, Xperia ray looks and feels as if it hadn‚Äôt been the last 3-4 years, and the good old classic Sony Ericsson at once, without experiments, jumped into an era when the drawn buttons defeated the real ones. <br><br>  The strict, ‚Äúout of time‚Äù design, the newest filling and the low price at the recommended 16,490 rubles make this phone a potential bestseller - this device can be presented to a person who did not recognize anything except buttons before, and he would not even notice the substitution - only it will be more convenient to use.  You can check my theory very soon - sales will start in a month. <br><br>  For the money the buyer will also receive: a stereo headset, a 4GB memory card, charging and a string. <br><br><h4>  Half year results </h4><br>  The range of models in the first half of 2011 is as follows: the main branch is the top Sony Ericsson Xperia arc, just the <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/119674/">Sony Ericsson Xperia neo</a></b> , the compact <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/118768/">Sony Ericsson Xperia mini</a></b> and just a very good Xperia ray;  side branch - side slider with qwerty-keyboard <b>Sony Ericsson Xperia pro</b> (which is more) and <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/121130/">Xperia mini pro</a></b> (which is smaller);  and pioneers - <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/117912/">Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY</a></b> and <b>Sony Ericsson Xperia active</b> .  Nice set for only 6 months, right?  And everyone has their right place in this friendly family. <br><br>  Also, an attentive reader might have noticed that I turned in my hands (and even drowned once) the new Xperia active.  But about this - in the next post. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/86d4b909/e4d5270b/5450ce93/b14b8bb8.jpg"><br><br>  PS Subscribe to our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/">blog</a> and you will not miss a single review! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124506/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124506/</a></p>
