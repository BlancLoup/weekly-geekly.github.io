  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Information and technological tools for the practical survival of social communities in the context of the Internet shutdown in 2014</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In December last (2013), a statement by Alexander Gostev (an expert from Kaspersky Lab) made at a special <nobr>press conference</nobr> was <a href="http://svpressa.ru/society/news/79131/">made public</a> , according to which this (2014) year will be the <b>last</b> year for the Internet in Russia.  The authorities of Russia, according to Gostev, are aiming to create a national network with limited access to foreign resources. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e00/689/a56/e00689a5675d53ea3b3885a45835eb78.jpg" align="right"></a>  A month later (in January of this year), the emergence of a bill <a href="http://talk.rublacklist.net/bills/communications/chapter1-communications/%25D0%25BF1%25D1%25811-3">providing for a</a> notification procedure for creating servers on the Internet showed, in a practical way, that Gostev rather downplayed the scope of intentions of domestic legislators.  First (February 26) <nobr><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/213951/">it became known</a></nobr> that this bill was approved by the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, that it is preparing for the first reading in the State Duma;  then, literally two days later (February 28), <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214245/">it</a> also <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214245/">became known</a> that the bill was passed by the State Duma in the first reading.  What will be the further development of events?  It is possible to suspect, and not without reason, that in the end everything will turn out about the same as happened with rallies and other mass gatherings of citizens: the notification procedure prescribed by law will naturally become <b><i>de facto</i></b> permissive, and the number of such servers allowed for mass visits via the Internet in Russia, it will be closer to the shrewd and gloomy estimate of ‚âà1943, which is sometimes <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson">attributed to</a> <nobr>Thomas J. Watson,</nobr> then president of IBM <nobr>(see photo) -</nobr> <b>no more than five pieces per year.</b> <br><br>  I‚Äôll say right away: trying to use a <nobr>couple of hundreds of the</nobr> last days of Habrahabr's existence with maximum benefit, <nobr>I, of course,</nobr> will not discuss <b>political</b> measures to counteract the above-mentioned legislative initiative, because the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/info/help/rules/">Habrahabr rules</a> prohibit it.  Also, I will not touch <nobr>upon</nobr> its influence <nobr>on the <b>business</b> in</nobr> order not to fall for it <nobr>in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/hub/business-laws/">hub-offtopic</a> .</nobr>  <b>Quite the</b> contrary - the practical survival of completely <b>non-profit</b> social communities will be the subject of my concern, and this is achieved not by political, but by purely <b>IT</b> tools.  That is why the thoughts set forth below are to be conveyed not only to Habrahabr (which would partially work with offtopics), but also to the external (in relation to Habrahabr) communities of its unregistered readers.  For this now, it‚Äôs true, they have also <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/563116">recently</a> come <nobr>to the hub-offtopic,</nobr> but directly to the black list of the Federal Guard Service (collecting names, addresses and other data on negatively-minded <nobr>Internet users) -</nobr> but this is <nobr>apparently an</nobr> inevitable evil. .  Not everyone is given, once having comprehended the benefit of the Internet, to have a positive attitude to the intentions of those who now actively hate it and are trying to destroy it.  Rather, the opposite is given.  Therefore, I suspect that the hour is not far when dissatisfaction becomes universal - and the FSO will inevitably have to purchase the Rostelecom subscriber base (and other providers) and use it instead of its own black lists.

      The bottom line is this: it would be nice to be ready for the future gradual destruction of the Internet.  Are you ready?  Is an alternative to the Internet possible, free from the fatal flaws that predetermined its destruction? <br><br>  I propose a simple mental exercise of the mind.  Imagine yourself a member of a vast social community formed on the Internet and uniting residents of various remote cities - uniting citizens who are far from personal acquaintance and communication in the so-called real world.  One or two servers important to this community already show ‚Äú451 ¬∞ error‚Äù instead of their home page;  and very soon (perhaps already to the table of the Second World War? ...) all, all its servers on the Internet will share the same fate in Russia: the Internet will become the Internet for them (from the word ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù). <br><br>  In addition, you are an IT specialist. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  A ready-made (illustrative) example of such a community is in the current RuNet a community of so-called ‚Äúanimeshnikov‚Äù (the term is to a certain extent conditional, since the community also includes fans of other forms of modern Japanese artistic culture - fans of not only anime, but also manga, ranobe , visual novels, danmaku, mini-sculptures, dakmakur, and so on).  This example is also not alien to Habrahabru: a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150007/">survey in 2012</a> showed that more than ‚Öì of Habrahabr's readers are positive about anime;  besides, at Habrahabr at least half a dozen blog entries (for example, available on the ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%5B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2588%25D1%258C%2B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%2Bthis%2Bworld%5D%26target_type%3Dposts">this world</a> ‚Äôs <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%5B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2588%25D1%258C%2B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%2Bthis%2Bworld%5D%26target_type%3Dposts">banter ment</a> ‚Äù tag) gave readers the opportunity to read in detail and closely observe the development and growth of government efforts to suppress animeshnik activity on the Internet - this increase occurs under the specious excuse to combat ‚ÄúSuicide propaganda‚Äù and, more recently, ‚Äúpedophilia‚Äù. <br><br>  Baseless or flimsy pretexts are called "ridiculous."  However, it is not a laughing matter for a long time.  Not fun, but a sense of burning and intolerable shame increases in the soul when you see Orthodox people in the Sverdlovsk region creating an ‚Äú <a href="http://politsovet.ru/44194-v-rossii-sozdadut-pravoslavnuyu-sistemu-borby-s-anime.html">Orthodox system of fighting anime</a> ‚Äù after the suicide of Yekaterinburg schoolgirls, in whose personal belongings a manga was discovered (perhaps, having no attitude <nobr>to work) -</nobr> while none of these Orthodox for decades paid no attention and did not rise to the struggle against the fact that in the very name of their region was one of the most directly perpetuated  x organizers of <b>mass infanticide</b> (and even more: the murder of the entire family of the last Emperor, later canonized).  Or when you see visitors of the Anime News Network site <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/bbs/phpBB2/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D2824318">discussing the</a> news that a Volgograd resident received three years in prison who uploaded unnamed videos of fictional minors who were sexually recognized by the court ‚Äî although a much more serious problem with the sexual corruption of real children is far from final solutions in Russia, so ANN visitors are at a loss. <br><br>  Does animeshnikov only concern this?  Of course not.  Seven months ago (August 8, 2013), <nobr>I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/189402/">called the</a></nobr> Russian anime community a kind of ‚Äúminer‚Äôs canary‚Äù, a living indicator of future negative changes in the entire Russian Internet.  And now I am not backing away from this opinion: the same fate awaits all network communities, all social networks in Russia.  The authorities will seek their closure and destruction under baseless and unfounded pretexts, and will be more effective. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7a/2a0/e87/d7a2a0e872d9fd2761f94e456d1409bc.jpg" width="162" align="right">  There are recent examples, and the most glaring examples.  We all happened to read the other day <nobr>( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214871/">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214871/">here</a> ,</nobr> for example) about the rapidly preparing ban on access to Yandex and Wikipedia (and the ban was supposed to be imposed without their prior notification) on the pretext that you can find some information about the film "Eternal Jew" <nobr>(1940).</nobr>  The court considered this as a sufficient excuse.  (It is worth mentioning that the practice of hiding this film from the public gradually acquires the features of fanatical persecution: it even went so far that on January 31, 2012, by decision of the Murom City Court, the image of a person of Jewish nationality was added to the Federal <a href="http://minjust.ru/extremist-materials">list of extremist materials</a> , at the bottom the text <nobr>"eternal Jew" -</nobr> therefore, the publication was made not only of the movie itself, but also of <nobr>its <b>posters</b> ,</nobr> in which the title is below, and not above the title character.  for illustration, you can see an example of such a poster, on which the inscription ‚Äúeternal Jew‚Äù is located at the top and which therefore was not prohibited by that court decision.) Also, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215087/">YouTube</a> was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215087/">closed by</a> part of Russian providers, because in several billion videos recorded by YouTube every day just one radical video call for Ukrainians. <br><br>  There is a theoretical background.  On February 21, the article ‚Äú <a href="http://expert.ru/2014/02/21/katalizator-nenavisti/">The Catalyst of Hate</a> ‚Äù was published in Expert, in the title of which even an inattentive reader can easily recognize the consonance with such materials of Russian anti-opposition propaganda as ‚Äú <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">Anatomy of Protest</a> ‚Äù or ‚Äú <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D4672108">Biochemistry of Betrayal</a> ‚Äù, whose names began in the same characteristic way - from the scientific the term.  The essence of this article is to list a number of evidence in favor of this opinion: the mechanisms of group thinking, which are an integral part of the human psyche, inevitably make any kind of social network a means of gradually transforming its participants into radicals, extremists, supporters of national, religious, civilizational, political and intolerance, so that the ability of people to look for like-minded people and communicate with them on social networks creates fanatics and terrorists by the very fact of their being  tweaked, resulting in a loss of critical thinking, ensures compliance in relation to the arguments of paid podryvateley rating of the Russian president, has fueled the escalation of violence in the real world, an example of what the author calls the Ukraine, as well as Syria <nobr>and (unexpectedly)</nobr> to Yemen. <br><br>  In short, this article justifies the use of the well-known repressive antisocial principle ‚Äúnot to gather more than three‚Äù (also ‚Äú <a href="http://traditio-ru.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">you need to sit at home</a> ‚Äù <nobr>, etc.)</nobr> not only in the so-called real world, but also in relation to the Internet social networks and communities.  If the government believes in any way the pro-government experts of this kind, then it inevitably came to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe need for the speedy physical destruction of all social networks (and not the Internet as a whole) in Russia.  It is this, perhaps, that we are seeing not the first year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02c/aef/60b/02caef60b4d93fd32e0e7e955431022d.png" width="153" align="right">  Having finished this introductory part, which is conscious, you can go to the second (and main) part of our mind exercise - go to brainstorming.  <nobr>What</nobr> shall we do?  What are all of our <b>existing</b> (non-political) means and methods for such opposition, which would allow social communities, deprived of the current Internet, to survive and survive? <br><br>  First of all, it is appropriate to point to such a non-trivial, but widespread computing and communication tool, which is a modern smartphone.  And I pointed it out to the animes guy in the interview I gave to Nubtayp (an informational publication on anonymous imageboards on which animeshniks hang out), and now I am pointing to Habrahabr.  Having opened the <a href="http://ichan.ru/NT24.pdf">twenty fourth number of</a> ‚ÄúNubtype‚Äù, which was released on December 14, 2013, you can easily read in it (on page 13) this is my opinion: <br><blockquote>  I wish the readers of "Nubtype" attentive attitude to the capabilities of those smartphones that many of us carry in our pockets.  Each latest-generation smartphone (among the Android models supporting leading manufacturers) is endowed with a FullHD screen, a multi-core processor, dozens of gigabytes of long-term memory, and a powerful video accelerator.  They can not only listen to soundtracks or read manga, but also watch anime (even with a ten-bit video quality).  In addition, the emergence of the BakaReader EX application (which resulted in about a year and a half of the work of the <nobr>Baka-Tsuki</nobr> site fans <nobr>)</nobr> allows you to read many mobile English translations in English, such as E-mail right now (for example, Log Horizon or Golden Time "), and has long been filmed (for example," Asura <nobr>Cryin '"</nobr> <nobr>or" Denpa</nobr> Teki na Kanojo ").  Do not miss this opportunity. <br><br>  Right now, work is underway to introduce high-speed mobile communication networks (LTE) in Russia.  For the time being, this process has affected only a few dozen major cities, but its ending promises to our smartphones completely new possibilities for streaming video viewing and file sharing.  Do not miss these opportunities. <br><br>  The future is radiant.  I even admit the possibility of combining smartphones into an Internet network that is little affected by the restrictions of Roskomnadzor, due to which tens of thousands of Russian animers have lost the ability to directly watch many anime websites (‚ÄúDanbooru‚Äù, ‚ÄúGelbooru‚Äù, ‚ÄúSankaku Complex‚Äù; references to such network repression can be found at Habrahabr on the "banish ment of this world" tag) were forced to look for workarounds (anonymizers, onion routers, virtual private networks) or accept. </blockquote>  What did I have in mind when speaking of the integration of smartphones into the non-Internet network?  Yes, about the same as what was said <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/164149/">on December 28, 2012</a> in Habrahabr: <br><blockquote>  For paranoid heaven, cryptography is not enough;  there should be more steganography. <br><br>  Something like this: wireless keys are worn by cats, with which keys are implanted under the skin, and <b>no one is suspicious of</b> cats. <br><br>  The network participant went out into the yard to knock out the carpet ‚Äî <b>and a solid-state wireless router was woven into the carpet with a metal thread</b> , and at that moment the packet wireless data transmission inside the square of four houses surrounding the yard began. </blockquote>  Don't we look like cats?  It seems to be somewhat similar: no one will suspect a person with a smartphone (a smartphone is completely normal), and meanwhile, the capabilities of modern networks (such as Bluetooth <nobr>or Wi-Fi ‚Äî</nobr> for example, <nobr>Wi-Fi Direct)</nobr> allow two people met in the crowd at high speed to exchange data, even without getting smartphones out of their pockets.  The same capabilities are possessed, in addition to smartphones, also tablets and laptops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc2/073/8ff/dc20738ff1408ac490828bff0437e3fd.png" align="right">  Such data exchange makes it possible at the modern technical level to revive the old practice of <b><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">flopping</a></b> (data transfer on floppy disks during a personal meeting of IT specialists) that existed in the eighties and partly in the nineties.  Another option for such an "floppy upgrade" is the exchange of high-capacity flash drives (even in a provincial city like Gelendzhik, <a href="http://gelendjik.positronica.ru/catalog/pz/flash_usb/%3Forder%3D-price">you can buy a</a> <nobr>128-gigabyte</nobr> flash drive for less than 4,000 rubles).  The one and the other variant of the ‚Äúmodern floppy‚Äù can serve as the transport level of <nobr>the <b>Fidonet</b> network</nobr> or another <b>FTN</b> <nobr>(Fidonet-type</nobr> Network) with all its services: netmail (similar to the Internet <nobr>e-mail),</nobr> echomail (analogue of the Internet forums, blogs, communities , message boards), file echo conferences (for broadcasting files), as well as so-called freaks (file requests, that is, file requests) <nobr>and FAQ servers ‚Äî</nobr> both are Fidonet‚Äôs analogous sites. <br><br>  In other words, such a network does not need the Internet, although it can also use it as a long-range transport.  It does not need to continuously connect its nodes to each other: it is enough to connect them during the exchange of information (several times a day, and not even once every few days). <br><br>  You can immediately indicate that the FTN network and disadvantages will be appropriate: such services that require continuous connection of network nodes to each other (chats, telephones, videophones, streaming video, network ‚Äúradio‚Äù) cannot exist over FTN. <br><br>  An information network that is technically organized in this way becomes another social network, on top of which (as over transport) all other (narrower) communities exist.  As in the case of <nobr>P2P file sharing,</nobr> <nobr>the FTN network</nobr> does not have any such <b>SPOF</b> (single point of failure, that is, a single point of failure) that the authorities of <nobr>any</nobr> state can hit in order to eliminate the community as a whole.  At the same time, the Internet has a fatal flaw that predetermined its destruction in Russia: it is enough for the authorities to close one site (key for some community) to lead to the elimination of this community (for example, the Habrahabr community will not survive the destruction of Habrahabr, while Fidonet‚Äôs echo conference can survive Suppose a moderator leaves Fidonet), and it‚Äôs enough for the authorities to give one provider (Rostelecom) a flick to disrupt the existence of the entire network (or any of its sites) in most Russian cities  (whereas in Fidonet, the disappearance of the network coordinator leads to re-election, the disappearance of a large hub leads to a reorganization of the routing, and the network is able to recover from this). <br><br>  Suppression of the FTN network by the authorities is possible, but (as it happens in the case of <nobr>P2P file sharing)</nobr> it cannot take the form of a SPOF point strike, so it takes the form of either mass reprisals against all community members, or pinpoint repressions of randomly selected <nobr>citizens are</nobr> both more annoying to society.  (Torrent file sharing is not pure P2P and contains SPOF in the form of trackers - and it is easy to see that the trackers are hit by the authorities: arrests of the ‚ÄúPirate Bay‚Äù participants, weaning RuTracker's domain and all that.) <br><br>  It is also not difficult to see that the <nobr>FTN-type</nobr> network excludes anonymous participation (operators of nodes connecting directly have to know each other).  This can be perceived as a disadvantage that prevents unrestricted freedom of speech.  At the same time, this factor can be perceived as a virtue, since it eliminates a number of negative manifestations on the network (anonymous spam, anonymous trolling ...) and restrains the radicalization of the participants' statements.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The possibility of anonymous repression by the authorities is also excluded, because the repressed always turns out to be a more or less well-known member of the global ‚Äúcommunity of communities‚Äù whose other members are geographically close (in the real world). In addition (as I mentioned in the same interview with Nubtayp), if in a certain community the complete anonymity of statements is spread (for which you don‚Äôt even need a pseudonym), then you often get such a confused situation when you can thank for valuable thoughts ), but you can‚Äôt listen carefully to their authors in the future - therefore, in the anonymous community, no relationship ‚Äúsenpai-kohai‚Äù </font></font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">or ‚Äúguru-</font></font></nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">teaching, and the spread of experience occurs mainly according to the memetic principle: thoughts survive not when backed up by a harmonious system (made up of several statements by one author) or by author's charisma, but when they are short and memorable, capable of imposing in mind.

The natural IT non-political response of the network ‚Äúcommunity of communities‚Äù to such a measure can and should be the rejection </font></font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">of Wi-Fi</font></font></nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in favor of an alternative data transfer technology.

Theoretically, more exotic communication channels are also possible - for example, </font></font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">TCP / IP </font></font></nobr> <nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">via audio channel ([ </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/213157/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ], [ </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214915/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ])</font></font></nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> or automatic generation of </font></font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">QR codes</font></font></nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> at one end and scanning them at the other. However, these alternatives are unlikely to gain popularity - the data transfer rate achieved by them is too low. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Secondly, the state can prohibit free public information networks, explaining this with another baseless and unfounded pretext. A good analogue is the </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbanning free Internet access </font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">via Wi-Fi</font></nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> with a motivation that </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">appeared </font></font><a href="http://www.utro.ru/articles/2014/01/28/1171385.shtml"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in January,</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> but what if </font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">via Wi-Fi</font></nobr></font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in a cafe you can blow up a nuclear power plant? ... ". To counter this can only spread the practice of free public information networks to such an extent that the violent ban of free networks (working within community friendships) in favor of paid and state-controlled providers would be perceived as intolerable interference with the privacy of many ordinary citizens - just as if it were, for example, the violent prohibition of free sex (occurring in love and in marriage) in favor of paid and state-controlled prostitutes OK. I gloomily suspect, however, that such a wide prevalence of free networks can be achieved only by winning a victory over the state in the competition "who will more quickly destroy the Internet in their favor."</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thirdly, the state can prohibit the possession of smartphones (tablets, laptops, routers) capable of organizing into a network that is not controlled by the state. </font></font><a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/%2528Spravka%2529%3FOpenAgent%26RN%3D449120-6"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bill </font></font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No. 449120-6</font></font></nobr></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (‚ÄúForeign equipment can be used on the territory of the Russian Federation in communication equipment, communication equipment, communication networks of all forms of ownership only if there is no similar Russian-made communication equipment complying with the requirements of </font></font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">paragraph 2.1.2 of</font></font></nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> this article </font></font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Äù ) -</font></font></nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, it is possible that it will be possible for you in your private property to prohibit the use of an iPhone, a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, a router, any imported equipment that does not have keypad ‚Äúbookmarks‚Äù inside. Perhaps, over time, they will not just be banned, but will also be withdrawn from the population, as non-channel radio receivers were seized during the Great Patriotic War - especially since we have a war on the nose, as you know. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fourth, the state can simply eliminate all computer-literate citizens, seeing in them a threat to stability and following the historical example of the Khmer Rouge, who eliminated all literate citizens in general.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is clear that to oppose the third and fourth options can only form an agreement in society on the question of the categorical unacceptability of mass repressions and a significant infringement of the rights of citizens. And in society and at the top. But I'm not very sure, gentlemen, that such a consent exists. Maybe it will turn out quite the opposite: let them read their ‚ÄúCatalyst of hatred‚Äù and wish us all to be torn </font></font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to</font></font></nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> pieces </font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">by such and such a</font></nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> mother in order to defeat extremism and terrorism. If in Volgograd you can condemn an ‚Äã‚Äãanimeshnik by analogy ‚Äúspread hentai - it's just the same as if a child fucked up, damn pedophile‚Äù, then you can probably condemn an ‚Äã‚ÄãIT-guy by analogy ‚Äúset up a </font></font><nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">mesh network -</font></font></nobr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">it is the same as if people in Volgograd were blown up, the terrorist is a cursed one. ‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Public opinion is extremely malleable. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On this my reasoning is over. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In conclusion, I ask you to follow my example, looking in the comments primarily for IT solutions (and not business solutions and not political solutions) for the problems discussed - when such solutions are possible, of course.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215121/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215121/</a></p>
