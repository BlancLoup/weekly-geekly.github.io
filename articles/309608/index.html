    <h4>  Set a personal goal </h4><br>  Let's calculate this business for the next three years.  Just let's go from the reverse.  First, determine how much you personally and your co-founders want to earn in three years.  It is from this that we will proceed planning how much you will need to work. <br><br>  For the time being, you decide for yourself personally, and I will set a goal for everyone else after 3 years - buy a new Toyota Corolla a month.  I think this is a pretty good motivator.  It sounds, of course, very kitsch, it seems like a business youth.  But what to do‚Ä¶ <br><br><h4>  Planning products </h4><br>  Before we begin, I once again draw your attention to the fact that we are opening the development of generalized sites for small businesses.  Why this is important, I told <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/309492/">in the first post</a> .  Getting started. <br><br>  We will sell four categories of sites: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Information sites</b> - this is the easiest and most popular product.  This primarily includes corporate websites of companies.  Targeted solutions (personal sites, event sites, sites ...) are all insolvent percentages.  It‚Äôs not worth refusing them, but focusing too. </li><li>  <b>Sites with product catalog</b> - the second most popular category.  This is a presentation of goods and services that can be ordered, but can not be bought online.  There are a lot of such sites and they, as a rule, are the most financial.  In most cases - this is the b2b segment that works not only for its region, but also for the whole of Russia. </li><li>  <b>Online stores</b> - product catalog with the ability to pay for goods online.  So far these sites are not the majority, but the group is gaining growth.  The average life cycle of such sites is on average less than in the first two categories, and the development cost is higher.  But if the store survived - this is a good customer. </li><li>  <b>Landing</b> - landing page.  This type of sites is already in the brain of each customer and it would be foolish not to select it as a separate category.  They order a lot, but not everyone who orders a landing page needs it.  They most likely need a hybrid landing, which is easy to promote and scale to a normal site.  + These sites are hard to standardize ... </li></ul><br>  Perhaps you will come up with something else, but you should not go into highly specialized solutions at the initial stage.  Even in the 1C product line, not a single niche solution soared in terms of money, as an independent product.  Therefore, we take a broad front. <br><br>  We plan to support by itself, we don‚Äôt climb into other services yet.  This is the most interesting, but a little later. <br><br><h4>  We plan dates and cost </h4><br>  It's all very simple.  The main thing now and in the subsequent is to understand that first you plan the indicators to which you go (specific figures), and then you figure out how to fulfill them. <br><br>  <b>Price.</b>  I advise you to start with the lowest price among competitors, but not lower than the profitability.  The minimum price will give you the opportunity to create a surplus of orders, which is very necessary to implement all the following tips.  It is clear that only because of the low price - orders will not appear, but as long as you have nothing else, then there is nothing (if there is, then great!). <br><br>  <b>Timing.</b>  This is an important criterion for the customer, especially for small businesses.  The client may say that this is not important to him, but this is not true.  The sooner you give him a working site, the more likely he will pay you and recommend to friends.  Determine the adequate time, a little less than the market.  Later I will tell you how to perform them. <br><br>  Why is order surplus important?  The fact is that if you do not have a stream of orders with which you will not cope, then innovations (process automation) will be introduced slowly.  The work will be calm, measured, you will feel that everything is fine ... until the competitors introduce new technologies and overtake you at high speed. <br><br><h4>  Studio Business Plan Template </h4><br>  In <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/xNYni7_wuwJnF">a business plan template,</a> almost everything is filled out for you.  First of all, fill in how much you want to earn in 3 years.  Now this amount is 700,000 rubles (profit before taxes).  If this figure suits you - leave everything as it is.  Salaries, rent - averaged for regional cities with a population of up to 400,000 inhabitants.  For larger cities can be adjusted.  But do not rush to inflate costs.  Some of our regulations will allow you to take and teach beginners, who in 3 months will become good specialists. <br><br>  For any questions you can write to me in the group on Facebook or in the comments to the posts.  The telegram is the same. <br><br>  All new materials will appear on CMS Magazine and on Habr√©.  We can also meet at webinars in order to expand on topics and discuss details.  Thanks to everyone who sends feedback! <br><br>  Vasily Churanov and <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/">Webcanape team</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309608/</a></p>
