  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NEC EA273WM - very angry 27 inches</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Smartphones, tablets, laptops ... Somehow recently everyone has become very mobile.  I recently realized that I had not been at a stationary computer for a very long time.  Meanwhile, it is still quite powerful, and it is much more convenient to do some things on it.  Ultrabooks are ultrabooks, but the film is more convenient to watch or play a game on a large display.  And it‚Äôs a pleasure to work with texts.  Only trouble arose: the old Samsung monitor about 19 inches began to hint that it was time for him to rest.  It is time to look for a replacement for him, and my choice fell on the NEC EA273WM.  Of course, it does not look so elegant, but for the same money that I spent on a 19-inch SyncMaster a few years ago, now you can buy a full-HD panel bigger. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3fb/d9b/d64/3fbd9bd640150e30bac8f4fec00c490a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So!  EA273WM - 27-inch NEC monitor with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.  The frame around the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãquite small - 2 cm, and the thickness of the monitor itself is quite small - 6 cm. The 4.5-pound design sits on a massive round base, which allows you to adjust the height, as well as the angle of rotation of the display vertically and horizontally.  In addition, the panel can be translated into portrait mode, but the orientation of the image will have to be changed in the operating system manually. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/db1/a73/e54/db1a73e546dcf328329900d799eff5ca.jpg"><br>  In the lower left of the case is a pair of USB for quick connection of peripherals.  On the rear panel, you can find a couple more ports, but this is clearly for connecting something for a long time, because  constantly deploy the monitor is unlikely someone will like it.  There is also an audio jack for connecting a sound source to two built-in speakers with a power of 1 W each. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5d/f60/824/a5df608249279ce5935885feaaaffa05.jpg"><br>  Nearby are numerous video ports: DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort and VGA.  In addition, next to them you can find a pair of connectors for connecting cables NEC Control Sync, with which you can synchronize up to five monitors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f9/153/184/1f915318438b9ad857218497b85ba75c.jpg"><br>  Along the bottom right of the panel is a row of touch buttons: the power key, the menu, OK, and the navigation buttons up, down, left, and right.  In addition, there is also an Eco button, with which you can select one of the three power modes of the device.  However, you can not bother manual adjustment, as the monitor is also equipped with a pair of sensors: proximity and illumination.  They work in tandem and can turn off the backlight when the user moves away from the computer or, on the contrary, twist the LED backlight to maximum if the room is too bright. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/991/4ac/334/9914ac334a6e824c78df2ae6be28ba30.jpg"><br>  The monitor is based on the TN matrix, which gives it both advantages and some disadvantages.  In general, EA273WM copes with the majority of the tasks assigned to it very well, but there are nuances.  For example, while watching movies, the monitor performs well on dynamic scenes without blurring the image, but the dark areas of the picture often merge together.  That is, grayscale - not the best side of this gadget.  If you want perfect black and gray, it‚Äôs better, of course, to turn your attention to the PAxxxxx line, besides multimedia, it‚Äôs also important that the text is displayed correctly, and here at EA273WM everything is great.  Even this model is not very bad viewing angles.  And if we are accustomed to the fact that almost no devices have any special problems with the horizontal, then not every monitor can work 160 degrees vertically. <br><br>  In general, the NEC EA273WM pleased with the functionality: here you have DisplayPort, sensors, and a fast matrix, and of course a large diagonal with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. There are, of course, drawbacks, but it's easy to accept them, given the price of this giant model not so high - it starts with 15 thousand rubles. </div>
