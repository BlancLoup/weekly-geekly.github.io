  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Donate or not donate local video content to Youtube?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Due to the low cost of production and broadcasting, now even small Internet media have acquired their own video content.  And three or four years ago it was quite a serious problem. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, you had to make your own flash-player, and second, somehow distribute the content.  Despite the availability of free players, they all required further work - where the interface is inconvenient, where in English, where the functionality is not enough.  And it was very risky to give the content yourself from your server. <br><br>  In this light, partner programs Youtube, Rutube, etc. became very attractive for small media.  They solved the problem with the player, and with the shipment of content.  In addition, manila and potential audience of these services.  However, I did not come across any local media that would successfully take advantage of this opportunity.  (Correct me in the comments, if that).  What is the problem? <br>  In my opinion, there were several scaring factors.  For conservative regional (in particular, the majority of small media are located in the regions) of the public, external players with their chips in the form of embedded advertising, copying tools for embedding code, etc.  too complicated.  For the content producer, someone else's built-in advertising (in addition, which takes the reader to the video hosting site) instead of being flexibly customizable, is an absolute minus.  Downloading content to the hosting manually is gloom. <br><br>  And although Youtube went to meet, allowed to register as a publisher and thus eliminated the pre-moderation, allowed to create channels and ask them their design, provided content protection tools, even offered to make money on it, its actions did not have any visible success.  Only large TV channels came to him.  Yes, and with very strange content.

      Nevertheless, Youtube does not leave attempts to attract new suppliers.  On June 28, he once again <a href="http://googlenewsblog.blogspot.com/2009/06/call-to-news-publishers-how-to-share.html">called</a> for news video producers to cooperate, this time enticing the integration of video with Google News, a proven source of traffic (though not yet for the Russian media).  According <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-youtube-jumps-into-the-local-news-business-what-it-means-for-broadcaste/">to PaidContent</a> , there were about 200 people willing to partner. And the other day, he had already openly invaded the interests of local media by launching the News Near You function.  The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/business/media/03youtube.html%3F_r%3D1%26ref%3Dmedia">called</a> it a double-edged sword, because Youtube in its opinion can both give the content more visibility and select the audience of its own local media sites. <br><br>  It would seem that it was not for nothing that the small media did not trust Youtube, but in my opinion, such a problem does not exist.  First, the content can be duplicated.  Secondly, it is a potential additional source of income.  Thirdly, correctly delivering and publishing content, you can get new visitors to your site.  Fourthly, you can competently embed your advertising directly into the content.  Fifthly, and most importantly, the current product ‚ÄúNews next to you‚Äù is not able to compete with you. <br><br>  There is nothing outstanding in this function.  All she does is give you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/news">on the news page a</a> video made within 100 miles of your ip address.  The maximum sample time is 7 days.  When I entered the page from Russia, I did not see any local content.  Not even a word in Russian.  Then I replaced in the Worldwide site settings with Russia.  It kind of helped.  The overwhelming majority of the proposed content was produced by the NTV television channel.  And although the rest of the content belonged to the News &amp; Politics category, as a whole it was not news, but outdated videotapes and reports of the events that happened once.  That is, the content of local media is either still not present, or it is clearly not enough to cover all the huge spots.  I don‚Äôt know how it is in the States, but the one I was offered didn‚Äôt fit the claimed algorithm.  It's not scary to compete with such a product. <br><br>  What again interferes with local media?  Interfere with at least the lack of automation to download content.  Why can't you ask the manufacturer for new content via RSS and download it yourself?  Is it really that hard to do?  I'm ready to give away your Youtube content, just don't make me do it manually. <br><br>  Youtube is to blame for its failure.  If you develop further criticism, what prevents to organize the news flow from custom videos?  Citizen journalism is today's reality.  Remember how many videos were recently uploaded from Iran.  Every day, the mass is laid out on the occasion of phone incidents.  Who prevents linking this content to Google Maps?  For example, based on ip and the information specified in the video description.  Technologically - a banal mash-up. <br>  In the spring of 2007, I, together with two fellow students, developed a business project for such a media.  Even at the marketing research stage, we wondered why Youtube, being part of Google‚Äôs domain, had not yet linked its content to Google Maps?  Where is synergy?  After all, the decision is obvious.  It lies on the surface, but things are still there. <br><br>  So do not be afraid of Youtube.  Use it as an additional distribution channel.
