All those who read this article who agrees with these speakers <a href="https://www.facebook.com/paulvoynov/posts/10207968645962140">Tyts1</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/op.spb.ru/posts/1075579032487334%3Fpnref%3Dstory">Tyts2</a> , is that it‚Äôs time to stop all this disgrace created by the precepts of Comrade Ogurtsov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ad8/c01/d63/ad8c01d639785263b052590979cc9c77.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sometimes it starts to seem to me that the information technology industry is the most stagnant and conservative in our country.  See for yourself, since the days of Brezhnev's eyebrows, thousands of new drugs and methods of treatment have appeared in the world, hundreds of new educational programs and pedagogical methods, dozens of building materials, several new types of fuel - and what has changed in RuNet?  Yes, new technologies are coming, but the approach itself remains the same: first, photoshop, icons, pixel licking, cookies, macbook, cutting layouts and a beautiful portfolio without measurable indicators of business improvement.  The only change in the last 15 years is the arrival of flat-design instead of skeuomorphism and "caramel".  Here is a revolution and a change of epochs!

Here is an example of the best joke, in the opinion of all viewers who recently passed the UX-Marathon: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yTzwjbMWLwg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiixeOGTjWvE8dwt7VOHSr27La54g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And it was generally the best, most interesting and useful story in the opinion of the visitors of this event.  People paid money, took away the time of their own single life from customers, from family, from raising their own children - for the sake of knowing this.  What then do you need arguments about wasting time on listening to all this gushing humor? <br><br>  As usual, my texts are not just a collection of criticism of the existing decrepit order, but also a set of specific proposals for correction and improvement.  And here again pedagogy comes to the rescue. <br><br>  It is clear that the information technology industry itself is very young and, step by step, must go through all the stages of an ordinary child from birth to adulthood and independence.  I propose to recognize the era of child incoherent babble complete (when any child just enjoys the fact that it can orally extract various sounds from themselves, attract the attention of parents and sometimes even accidentally combine entertaining phrases, see the video above) and move on to the age of "I myself" .  This period means that the kid is becoming more and more interested in real human activity and wants to take off his sandals by himself, to knock Dad's hammer himself, to sprinkle with his mother's cologne, to dissolve his grandmother's knitting, etc.  So the young creature (and the young branch) gradually become familiar with adult problems, needs, skills, try themselves in the role of various characters, etc.  Once again, all this activity for a child (and for the IT industry) is much more complicated than just cute agitation and smoking to the joy of mom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/342/9ca/e6f/3429cae6f43003c1f43e71ca257d47ee.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  How can such a growing industry period look like in practice?  This is when, instead of comfortable hotels and conference rooms, industry experts come directly to the customer‚Äôs workplace at the Novouralsk Pervotrubny Factory, Kemerovo Kokoferrometallurgichesky Kombinat or to the port of Nakhodka and, having broken into teams, under mandatory adult supervision, really try their strength as characters on those objects which then plan to automate and virtualize. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/402/233/aff/402233aff043c7c34adf62d92828a908.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Although why only existing large enterprises?  Would it be less useful for a quality startup to get brainstorming from several dozens of leading industry experts, and in a variety of ways, from marketing to cloud storage?  And the start-up gets such crucial help and support in the initial stage in exchange for a paid holiday of a fun party within the framework of one weekend. <br><br>  So, for any customer, all this simply looks like the most necessary, effective and realistic tender under his strict supervision: 3 teams of logo makers under the guidance of Professor Heraldry, 8 backend warehouse operations teams and 15 competing to death groups of interface creators under strict supervision of the deputy on technical processes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5f1/d04/06d/5f1d0406d56c5402280078fc22281365.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The winning team receives an order, and the losers receive a tremendous real experience, new technologies of management and interaction within the Scram-teams, and new connections, too, since getting to know each other in the process of active competition is much easier than lying in chairs between lectures. <br><br>  At the same time, it will be easy to test in practice new methods of team management - this is where the expanse for practitioners of Scram, Kanban and other Ajaila.  Here, as mushrooms, new talented managers and managers will grow, in a real battle, showing their remarkable skills in mobilizing a motley unfamiliar team for the qualitative solution of the operational problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7c9/5d5/f87/7c95d5f8788431da53591922d2e64598.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I anticipate the objection that many top studios, it‚Äôs said, will be unprofitable to send their representatives to such ‚Äúpractical tenders‚Äù, because they will not be able to get the whole tasty and expensive order in its entirety, but only a small piece of the brand book or vice versa the optimal linking of the project with the customer‚Äôs 1C system .  And, they say, it's so bad. <br><br>  Not at all.  On the contrary, it will be good and it will be progressive.  As you all know, few of the theorists will have the courage to try out their own knowledge in practice, precisely because it destroys the whole usual way of things.  Many people really get scared from the mere thought that organized established teams have long been outdated and the era of free radical experts has arrived, which, within the framework of one two projects, get together in groups, solve practical problems and then scatter again around the area.  Isn't this the ideal dream of any scrum master? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/409/dc0/965/409dc09653b7184d3a1c7273c11cff78.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Like it or not, and for the customer this approach is ideal in all respects.  Why should he pay money to the entire web studio or Internet agency, when he receives the required level of quality of services from only 1-2 specialists, and in return for the rest of the interns, the customer would like to hire a third-party expert on transport interfaces and ergonomics of the route list, taking into account the 12-hour operator changes.  There is no such thing in the studio, but there is one on the side, which means that any one-time team will be much more effective in each specific case for solving each real task. <br><br>  Having run around such an idea in several real tenders with major customers and startups, I would suggest taking up the next stage for socially-charitable projects.  And these parties will already look more like rest and fun leisure of colleagues in the industry, when the desire to win by any means and grab a solid sum from the future project no longer blinds. <br><br>  Just imagine: Baikal, bath-house, snowmobiles, ice-bathing, hot Ice night-time cabaret, and in passing - creating an iPhone application for deaf-and-dumb children or a portal for lonely pensioners for a week, or maybe it will be a single network for searching for missing people or a device to control neighbors throwing out garbage from windows.  Together they piled up and did, interspersing socially useful work for the benefit of the whole society and personal active rest, all the same because all of them came with laptops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b78/115/533/b781155337e827fb4ac4c56cf1ab209d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fun, useful, on courage, in pleasure, and on the basis of such a workshop-tender - so everyone will feel not today's devastation after the next RIW, but the benefits of their stay on sinful earth, though not for long. <br><br>  In addition to the obligatory minus in such cases to the author, I also propose to leave, directly in the comments, applications for productive holidays for the coming New Year holidays, coupled with new professional contacts, fighting for an interesting tender and developing new practical and team skills according to all the rules of Scrum. <br><br>  <b>Related Links:</b> <br>  <a href="http://cadavercyan.com/post/71194464412">Oral stage of development of a person and profession - up to one and a half years</a> <br>  <a href="http://zdorove.org/mama_poimi_menya/page4.html">Stage "I myself" (from 2 to 4 years in the industry)</a> <br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Psychosocial development</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295700/</a></p>
