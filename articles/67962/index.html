  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Creating a blog - creative searches</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Which engine to choose for the site? <br>  Modern history of the blog "For Tea". <br><br>  Once we were invited to another business center for the production of secret works.  Nothing to do, let's go.  He placed the brigade in its place, marked the scope of work, and he, as befits a brigadier, began to idle. <br>  It was a pity to waste time just like that, without any sense, and I went to create the appearance of vigorous activity, that is, to cut out of paper the design of the future site. <br><habracut><br>  At that moment I was very worried about the question on which platform to transfer the <a href="http://zachaem.ru/">site ‚ÄúOver Tea‚Äù</a> , so that it would be comfortable for me and my friends to write in it, and for this to cause as little rejection as possible. <br>  About rejection, I spoke not by chance.  The previous engine on which the site was implemented - joomla at the end of its stay caused only an emetic reflex.  Crude platform with a bunch of piles.  Working with joomla was sheer agony, that's a fact.  In this, I wanted something more user friendly, sharpened for an ordinary user. <br>  Began the search engine.  For a couple of months I had to sort out: wordpress, drupal, and only after it I turned to livestreet. <br>  Briefly about each of the engines: <br><br>  1. <a href="http://joomla.ru/">Joomla</a> <br>  Mostly designed for classic sites, sites - business cards of companies.

      <u>pros</u> <br>  the ability to create a complex site structure, <br>  seo oriented engine <br>  good support of domestic specialists, <br>  A large number of free and paid themes site design. <br>  low resource consumption <br><br>  <u>minuses</u> <br>  it takes a lot of time to understand the structure of the engine <br>  Enough raw engine, a lot has to be tightened up. <br>  there are a lot of raw modules for the engine, most of them are made frankly ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù.  It is necessary to sweat to make the "assembly" work stably. <br><br>  The main reason for the lack of development of the engine and modules is its free of charge, and free of charge in everything.  It is worth considering that if you do not pay money for the engine itself, then you will compensate for this savings with your time spent reading the support forum.  And I assure you that you will kill time essentially with big money! <br><br>  2. <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> <br>  This engine is perfect for large portals, in fact, I position it for myself that way.  I will give an example, taking the well-known site, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">habrahabr.ru</a> , as a reference point; the guys were able to achieve similar functionality with regular modules: <a href="http://www.shvabrashvabr.ru/">Shvarabvvr</a> . <br>  I think comments are superfluous. <br><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  the possibility of creating a super complex (!) site structure, <br>  seo oriented engine <br>  sufficient support of domestic specialists, <br><br>  <u>minuses</u> <br>  high resource intensity <br>  site design will have to create their own, ready to manage skins will hardly be able to <br>  it takes a lot of time to understand the structure of the engine <br>  there are a lot of raw modules for the engine, there is a problem of supporting the evolution of the modules, that is, if the module is suitable for version 1.0, then it is not at all the fact that it is also suitable for version 1.1. <br>  it will be extremely difficult for one to raise something serious on this engine. <br><br>  Summarizing, I will say that the demands on hosting and the ability to work out the structure of the future portal in an extremely detailed way shift this engine from single developer students to the teams of portal developers. <br><br>  3. <a href="http://mywordpress.ru/">Wordpress</a> <br>  The authors of the engine have tried to make it extremely convenient and understandable in the work of even a completely inexperienced user.  An example of this is the installation of this CMS in five minutes.  At the same time, as is usually the case, you have to sacrifice something, in this case I had to pay performance, this engine categorically did not want to run on my subdomain, immediately demanding about 5 megabytes of memory for me, if I'm not mistaken.  And this is even without additional modules. <br>  On this engine it is decent to make only blog-like sites. <br>  In the spring, literally a week and a half or two, he threw up such a portrait: <a href="http://robotage.ru/">robotage.ru</a> <br><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  the system is easy to install even for an absolute beginner <br>  modern stable system <br>  easy to administer <br>  a huge number of various modules and modifications, both domestic and foreign <br>  sufficient support of domestic specialists <br><br>  <u>minuses</u> <br>  high resource intensity <br>  site design will have to create their own, ready to manage skins will hardly be able to <br>  there are raw modules for the engine, there is a problem of supporting the evolution of the modules, the version supported is always indicated on the site, that is, it is rather difficult to make a mistake <br><br>  4. <a href="http://livestreet.ru/">LiveStreet</a> <br>  This CMS was chosen by me for the blog ‚ÄúFor Tea‚Äù.  The reasons for this mass.  But the most important thing is that this engine supports the community of users, while the community has the ability to actively influence the development of the site and develop independently. <br><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  blog social engine <br>  stability <br>  good support of domestic specialists, <br><br>  <u>minuses</u> <br>  its blog-social orientation is also a minus, that is, this engine has pronounced specificity that is not suitable for everyone and not for any projects. <br>  site design will have to create their own, ready-made skins are still quite small <br>  it will be extremely difficult for one to raise something serious on this engine. <br><br>  Summary: <br>  website for the company - joomla <br>  portal - drupal <br>  personal blog - wordpress <br>  collective blog - livestreet <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  PS The following material is likely to be devoted to a social network (vkontakte like) - <a href="http://elgg.org/">elgg</a> </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67962/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67962/</a></p>
