  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Impressions of Motorola Milestone after three weeks of use</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  First, a few introductory: <br>  1. Before this device, I used the iPhone 2G (exactly 2G due to the non-aluminum aluminum case) for more than two years and was very pleased.  Before Iphone, I used Vinmobile and was also pleased. <br>  2. I have in general quite good IT background, although I am not the admin now, but I installed Linux in my time and set up FTN (the fidash node - T-mail, Golded, FromtDoor on DesqView and OS / 2, who remembers will understand), so if you like, I like to dig into the settings.  Although I haven't put anything on the computer for a long time. <br>  3. My phone is always in the mode of receiving and receiving mail, I actively use the web.  A lot of voice and sms.  Sometimes I use maps and navigation.  I always have two phones - one with a permanent number, the second on business trips.  Accordingly, I have all four-standard phones, if a child takes a second one from me, then I buy a bu, most often this is the SE k750 - any degree of killed is a workhorse. <br>  4. Impressions are written from Android + Milestone, and sometimes it‚Äôs hard to separate what is in the operating system. <br>  5. All criticism can not block a good impression of the platform and the apparatus. <br><br>  So, after unpacking, charging and turning on, everything started right away.  The device was synchronized with the gmail account and it all worked.  Box software did not start on Win7-64-Ultimate, so I was left without synchronizing music, and possibly contacts.  On the website of Motorola, I did not find anything in English, only in German.  And then the first problems began to emerge. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before that, everything was synchronized with Outluk.  With an iphone through aytyuns, with other phones through their software, but always with outlook too.  Here the ambush swam.  I had to look for a software to synchronize Gmail's Outlook &lt;=&gt;.  I went through the Internet and found two tools that synchronize contacts and calendars (Google Calendar Sync and Soocial), did not find how to synchronize via mobile.me, I think that in time it will be decided.  Total synchronized Outluk with Gmail and with Android. <br>  Small problems with a notebook popped up.  With what they are connected, I can not say, but they resolved themselves.  The search can not find the right person in the notebook, but when you dial his number with pens - he immediately substitutes the entry from the notebook.  But then somehow disappeared by itself. <br>  Problems with Russian decided to install Russain Keyboard from Game Warior, the only glitch is working with SMS.  The recipient does not receive Russian letters.  Cured by replacing the basic program of work with SMS on Handcent SMS, which has become with the iPhone interface.  But when sending bulk SMS all the same glitch.  600 recipients of congratulations on sms happy new year did not receive Russian letters, but only punctuation marks and 2010. I plan to engrave Russian letters on it, because I like the physical keyboard more than the on-screen keyboard. <br>  In addition, put Google Voice and Skype.  Both surprised me that when they try to call somewhere, they call the American number instead of connecting through the Internet. <br>  In addition, I set a stopwatch and a voice recorder.  These are the things that are always needed. <br>  I suffered a little from distributing the Internet to a computer from it.  As a result, I installed pda-net (I got used to it from the iPhone).  It was here that the first system glitches jumped out, which turned out to be very unpleasant.  Android multitasking and at the moment when he actively uses other applications (synchronizes mail, checks new tweets), i.e.  the processor is loading, the connection may be broken by timeout.  She is quickly recovering, but nevertheless it is sad. <br>  I am very pleased that Skype, GTLK, Twitter and I are constantly online in the background, which pleased me most of all compared to iPhone, but you have to pay for everything, in this case, communication breaks. <br>  The browser is very pleasant, not as much as in Athos, but the expectations were not so good.  Multitouch is not as sensitive and accurate as in iPhone, but acceptable. <br>  Small problems with Gmyl.  And I, according to my old memory, Autluk threw up a mail with a gmyl and Gmyl archived it, keeping the inbox always empty.  With this approach, Android did not see any correspondence, and there is no possibility to look into the ‚ÄúAll Mail‚Äù folder ‚Äî where it is being archived.  Now I always have mail in the inbox for the last 4 days, which is sad. <br>  Maps and navigation work perfectly, but did not check how much battery is enough.  A battery is enough in the butt for the day working, but I always have the opportunity to charge, so we will check it on business trips.  + Do not forget that he always works for me with an Internet. <br>  I keep the Wi-Fi turned off, it turned out to be weaker than in the iPhone and not in the whole apartment.  + he does not let the hidden network go for a long time, which means that he leaves her apartment for a long time and does not look for alternatives.  Yes, and unpleasant, when in the apartment suddenly the network is visible, but there is no Internet.  In this case, the iPhone itself switched to GPRS, which Android does not do. <br>  For three weeks the device fell more than 2 dozen times, which did not affect it in any way (this was the main reason for the non-transition from iPhone 2G to more modern ones - I do not trust plastic cases).  A neat border on the edge of the screen does not allow it to scratch and when you ‚Äúface down‚Äù on the tile, there is no damage to the screen.  Three weeks without a protective film and no scratches on the screen. <br>  Another small problem is that the rubber cover is on the back side, the back cover opens by itself - it opens with a ‚Äúslide‚Äù and there is a chance of losing it. <br>  For some reason, with a freshly bought Jabra buggy.  I do not know whose this glitch, but very sorry. <br>  And now the main thing!  Most of the glitches described in my understanding - it is from the damp platform.  To IPhone, in my first month of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/18294/">retension, there was much more</a> .  I like the device and the platform.  Does not leave the feeling of my degradation after using the iPhone, there are almost no settings and customization.  As dad Steve said, so use. <br><br>  <b>What I basically like:</b> <br>  - multitasking! <br>  - flexibility, I have the impression that by rummaging everything can be customized <br>  - Android Market is much more convenient to use than the Apple Store. <br>  - physical keyboard <br>  - the ability to replace any basic applications that are not available in the iPhone <br>  - when installing the application, it shows which critical resources the application accesses <br>  <b>What does not like:</b> <br>  - damp <br>  - lack of application priorities in multitasking <br>  - the inability to give the Internet on wifi, I think that decide. <br>  - expensive

      In the next trip to the States I will try to buy the Nexus Van, the price is interesting, with two phones of the same type, there should be less problems, and if not, that is, someone to shove. <br><br>  Well, according to the old tradition, my <a href="http://twitter.com/dennydov">twitter</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80389/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80389/</a></p>
