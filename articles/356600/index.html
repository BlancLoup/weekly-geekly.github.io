  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Slur - a decentralized network for the sale of classified information for bitcoins</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Translation of the introductory <a href="http://slur.io/">page of the project</a> , which seemed to me unexpected, interesting, and somewhere even frightening.</i>  <i>A group of developers who call themselves u99 offer the public to support their project with donations or with their own developer time.</i> <br><br>  <b>Slur</b> is an open source system project for decentralized anonymous sale of secret information for Bitcoins.  Slur is written in C and works on top of the Tor network.  Bitcoin transactions are performed using libbitcoin.  Buyers and sellers are completely anonymous, and there are no restrictions on the data put up for sale.  Except for cases when a dispute begins and a certain amount is paid for its permission, the percentage of transactions is not charged. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How it works? </h4><br>  Vendors encrypt, download, and add to the lists of their data as easily as it does on eBay.  This happens anonymously and without restrictions on the nature of the data. <br><br>  Exclusive buyers try to buy data for their own use only and prevent other sellers from trying to buy a copy.  If the exclusive wins the auction, only they get the keys to decrypt.  This data can no longer be sold through Slur again. 
      <br>

      Mass buyers invest their money in one big "boiler".  If they win the auction, the keys to decrypt the data go online and the information becomes public. <br><br>  Arbitrators - randomly selected users who agree to resolve disputes in cases where the buyer declares that the purchased data does not match the description of the seller. <br><br>  Public key cryptography ensures that only the auction winner can decipher the data being sold. <br><br>  For example, the seller signs, encrypts, uploads and puts up for sale a document describing its contents.  When sellers place bets, their money is automatically credited to the escrow account.  The winner of the auction becomes the exclusive buyer and receives a key for decryption.  Lost money back in full. <br><br>  At this step, the winner has the opportunity to evaluate the document before the seller receives the money in order to verify its compliance with the description.  If it matches, the funds from the escrow account go to the seller.  Otherwise, a dispute is started.  Then, five arbiters are given keys, with which they decrypt the document and compare it with the description.  Their decision by a majority vote determines where the money goes from the escrow account.  For the services of arbitrators from this account they are paid a small amount. <br><br>  If mass buyers win in the auction, they have the opportunity to check the document's compliance with the description and make a dispute.  If the majority of buyers, or the set of buyers who have paid more than 33% of the cost in total, are disappointed, a dispute will be opened. <br><br><h4>  Application </h4><br>  With proper implementation, the system will deeply and permanently change our community.  The unregulated information market will redefine the value of a person‚Äôs assets, since in the future they will be compared to the value of his secrets. <br><br>  Groups of people Slur can do even more damage.  By some estimates, psychopaths make up 5% of society.  An anonymous network will launch a much larger flow of information than ideology that guides patriots like Edward Snowden.  For every idealist who freely donates his freedom, property, and life for the common good, there are 1,000 psychopaths willing to anonymously sell someone‚Äôs secrets. <br><br>  In organizations of any type ‚Äî governments, corporations, the military ‚Äî there are both a large number of liquid assets and a large number of secrets.  At the same time, a large number of disgruntled or psychopathic personnel have access to them.  After the launch of Slur, these organizations will lose assets and secrets. <br><br>  The emergence of such a market will increase the demand for bitcoins - from those who will try to buy previously inaccessible documents, and from those organizations that will prevent information leaks. <br><br>  Slur is WikiLeaks 2.0.  Unlimited access to the truth to everyone without exception.  Only in the future will journalists have to pay compensation to people selling secrets for their risks. <br><br><h4>  What we expect to see on sale at Slur </h4><br>  - trade secrets <br>  - consumer product projects <br>  - source code of proprietary operating systems and software <br>  - zero day exploits <br>  - instructions on the use of "black moves" in hardware and software <br>  - Database.  Now, just apologizing for data leakage will not be enough - companies will have to pay to prevent leakage. <br>  - evidence of tax evasion bosses from staff who are dissatisfied with their work, or who are underpaid. <br>  - military secrets <br>  - aerospace development <br>  - development of protective systems <br>  - evidence of ongoing judicial investigations <br>  - obscene photos and videos of celebrities <br>  - social network databases <br>  - evidence of corruption of the authorities (preferably closer to the next election) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356600/</a></p>
