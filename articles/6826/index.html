  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Strategy time</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, almost any fan of the strategy genre could be quietly in anabiosis and not worry that he would miss something interesting.  It seemed that the developers at once forgot about the RTS.  In fact, everything was wrong.  The necessary games were forged in secret laboratories.  And now it is time for change.  Finished games hit the shelves. <br><br>  Today we will look at the 3 strategic games of this year‚Äôs spring draft. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will say right away that I am familiar with all three of the demos.  Therefore, the review will be short and very superficial.  However, I hope that he will help you in choosing the right game. <br><br>  In 1994, the company Mythos Game with the help of the publisher MicroProse released the game X-COM.

      That's what the GameSpot website observer wrote about this: ‚ÄúAt first I didn‚Äôt‚Äú drive in ‚Äù.  Newsgroups exploded with enthusiasm about the X-something-there, the editor gave me a disc so that I could urgently make screenshots.  I looked - I did not like it.  Okay, I think I'll take the drive home for a couple of days ... A big mistake.  The next few months, I slept an hour a day.  Sometimes I ran off from work at lunchtime to grab another hour of play.  My dog ‚Äã‚Äãalmost died of starvation - fortunately, at some point, the relatives took her away from me. ‚Äù <br><br>  Yes, this game in its time was truly great!  Today, the studio that created it has disappeared into oblivion.  And the very right to continue the game for a long time wandered around for different game builders, until it found refuge in the Czech Altar Games. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7ae/f33/94c/7aef3394c0bef5bf15d2f07efca3d1f4.jpg" width="450" height="337" alt="Ufo" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  After a series of not very successful attempts to repeat the success of the original, the new ‚ÄúUFO: Insight‚Äù seems successful.  I, as a fan of the series, had a pre-exaggerated enthusiasm for the next part.  Please take this into account. <br><br>  So, the Earth is conquered by a race of evil aliens.  People are forced out of their planet to Mars.  It is this red ball that we will have to settle in.  We have few resources, some kind of equipment and base.  Scientists will learn, workers will work, soldiers will be soldiers, and we will rule all this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/125/6d9/b03/1256d9b039cc9c49c08a7dc29fbd0da0.jpg" width="450" height="337" alt="Ufo" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Before us is a classic turn-based strategy with division into battles, base management and exploration of the planet.  The graphics are very nice, although you can‚Äôt call it fancy.  I was immediately seduced by a toy-like man and in the same style painted by Mars.  I love this style. <br><br>  Of course there are also disadvantages that fall out of the game from the very first krosekund.  Inconvenient control (the developers found that the whole world uses three-button mice), jumping untied camera, vague interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/3e3/5fe/d40/3e35fed402383a8d4d51f1815fce40cf.jpg" width="450" height="337" alt="Ufo" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  And yet this game is worth attention, if only because, unlike many other strategies, this is not a stupid rush, but a more subtle brain-entertainment. <br><br>  The next bidder is even better known than the old X-COM.  A descendant of one of the first strategic games in the world ("Dune" 1992), was grown at Westwood Studios.  Command &amp; Conquer was first born in 1995.  In view of the fatal combination of circumstances, Westwood Studio did not live up to our days.  The flag was picked up by a huge and powerful Electronic Arts.  And now we have the third carnation of the Tiberium war series - Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d79/591/a41/d79591a41013db74b70b948a1041f7bd.jpg" width="450" height="337" alt="C &amp; amp; C" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Immediately, I note a perfectly riveted game engine.  Defying all modern graphic features, it allows you to drive the game with proudly upturned settings even on medium-power gaming computers. <br><br>  The graphics are of course canceled.  But what about the essence?  But the essence remains the same.  Accumulate more resources, create more equipment and soldiers and violently bring down all this avalanche on your opponent.  Perhaps C &amp; C provides for subtle strategic steps, but in the demo version I did not notice them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/52c/950/44e/52c95044e5f50d6c77a4902cbc5d9157.jpg" width="450" height="337" alt="C &amp; amp; C" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Constructive game remains the same for a year.  It only acquires new graphic capabilities.  How many times the series for this scolded igropress.  But you can see people like the simplicity and unpretentiousness of C &amp; C.  The game of course will have big sales around the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/3d1/517/4d7/3d15174d761fc9e4c2147ecba10126f2.jpg" width="450" height="337" alt="C &amp; amp; C" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  The third guest of our article (the creator of the legendary superhit "Total Annihilation") Chris Taylor.  His Supreme Commander shows complete contempt for any graphic velvet and curl.  Externally, the game is simple to indecency.  With such a picture one could proudly appear 5 years ago, but not today.  The whole secret lies in the fact that the game is designed for real strategists, which is important meaning, not appearance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/9f4/8b1/16f/9f48b116ffafe4b0ded7665ae031b63f.jpg" width="450" height="337" alt="Supreme commander" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Initially, it seems that in the game everything is exactly the same as in others.  Collecting resources, building factories and technology.  But the longer you play it, the more nuances and differences you see in comparison with the same C &amp; C. <br><br>  And yet, I advise you to be careful about the acquisition of Supreme Commander.  The game may not like it, do not you have a certain strategic experience and certain claims to other primitive strategies.  To understand the beauty of the new creation of Taylor is not given to everyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/3b7/82b/44f/3b782b44fe53542cfa8df45935741335.jpg" width="450" height="337" alt="Supreme commander" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Actually, I said everything I wanted.  As you probably already understood, my personal preferences, after three demo versions, fell on the UFO game.  And not because she is beautiful and irresistible, but rather because of the nostalgic memories of her grandmother, whom I met back in 1994. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6826/</a></p>
