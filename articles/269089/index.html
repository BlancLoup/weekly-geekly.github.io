If you take the Top 100, Top 1000, the picture will change a little.  Social forms are even on the smallest site, even if it is a form of communication with support.  Discussions, comments, social networks - there is a lot of social traffic on the network.

      Social web is everywhere, but the structure of the network, social forms, browser capabilities do not correspond to the natural needs of the person, despite the obvious need for this. <br><br>  One of the main drawbacks is that, due to the technical limitations of the forms of expression, we are forced to assemble social forms directly onto the content page in a way that is not convenient enough to use them, additionally overloading the page and increasing its weight and complexity.  You say ‚ÄúI like it!  Stylish, comfortable. "  But if to take into account that in order to communicate, visitors switch to social networks or to other sites, then we see that most of the visitors still do not find what they would like in these forms.  Nevertheless, these forms are placed directly from the main content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/314/7a5/76c/3147a576c7104ad89a05ae5d7e7d629f.png"><br><br>  <i>(Is this a movie or a chat site?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Pay attention, this is the page from which the visitor is being driven!</i>  <i>A new, progressive design and generally cut off this category of visitors as untargeted.)</i> <br><br>  The limited services offered and the forms of communication are probably the main disadvantage of the implemented forms.  The types of communication forms (comments, discussions, chats, etc.) are not so much invented, but even less are implemented on a particular site in an embedded form.  We are offered a wide choice of one provider and this provider provides one type of communication forms, this is the entire range installed on the page by the site owner.  And this type of communication should look beautiful in appearance and not overload the page, and the convenience here is at the end of a long line of demands. <br><br>  Disadvantages of elaboration and design of social forms.  Social forms on the sites are secondary, they are often individual solutions with self-saw deficiencies.  On specialized industry or small social form sites, the thing is alien to the site owner and they are not given enough attention.  The owner needs them as far as or for indexing.  And even on the websites of top companies, social forms are far from ideal.  And they certainly do not support complex social behavior, for example, cooperation or such concepts as social circle. <br><br>  Special restrictions.  Somewhere due to technical reasons, where due to administrative reasons, deliberate restrictions are imposed on the communication in the network.  By the number of posts, limited access, moderation or administrative policies.  (How many visitors would have commented on the articles if not for the habr restrictions?) I don‚Äôt know if we will communicate more and better if we remove a number of these restrictions, but the fact that there will be significantly more social traffic is a fact. <br><br>  Few cooperation, interaction sites is limited.  The security mechanism prevents cross-domain requests, so any interaction is possible only through the host site or, if a third party wants to provide its service on any network site, this is possible through the browser extension mechanism.  Which of course leads to the non-proliferation of universal solutions and solutions from small vendors. <br><br><h2>  The solution is not trivial. </h2><br>  A comprehensive solution was born at the junction of several disciplines.  These are interface design, browser component, service, standard extension, search, and organizational part + plan of events. <br><br><h2>  What is offered </h2><br>  The visual part of the solution is a specialized panel in the browser, designed to accommodate web pages, forms of a certain type - informational or social.  That is, those who are focused on all sorts of communication and user interaction.  Forms of commenting, discussions, chat, feedback, wiki and many many other forms have much in common in their implementation, the functionality provided and how the user works with them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61d/44f/156/61d44f1565644f3eb9f20f3e4cb8f44d.png"><br>  <i>(In fact, the layout will be somewhat different, but the figure is clearer)</i> <br><br>  A specifically constructed, complex panel will provide a technical opportunity for the removal of embedded social forms from the main content page.  As a result, it is assumed that the panel will provide additional convenience when working with a browser - it will simplify and reduce the number of steps during navigation, allow you to more ergonomically compose the content of the pages, provide additional indication aimed at improving user interaction.  But more important, as it seems to me, this is that by taking out or at first simply copying a part of the functionality from an overloaded page to a separate panel, we can create a technical opportunity to implement alternative offers, alternative services on any site. <br><br>  The visual part + internal components = a technical tool for creating solutions by site owners.  Some browser development. <br><br><h2>  Real review: ‚ÄúPanel?  Why is this needed ??  I do not need any panel !!! " </h2><br>  Do not worry, maybe there will be no panel.  For now, this is just a designer‚Äôs reasoning, so we have fun or are looking for something new.  But if you manage to implement, do not worry, be sure to tell you everything. <br><br><h2>  Why do you need it? </h2><br>  To create optimal and convenient web applications.  To solve some of the problems that have now accumulated in site building.  For maximum convenience of communication and user interaction on the Internet. <br><br>  First, it will be a kind of interface solution.  This is what is called in the design leading and subordinate forms that will bypass the restriction on cross-domain interaction without damage to the security mechanism.  And the panel will take advantage of the multi-screen modern computers. <br><br>  Secondly, as a specialized and independent form, the panel can be endowed with different mechanisms for solving domain problems.  In our case, what is required for communication and user interaction.  At the same time, the creation of such mechanisms with the proposed logic of the panel does not require their wide standardization for compatibility.  That is, for example, it will be possible to add the transport of the notification mechanism in one separate browser project and not to worry that there is no such mechanism in browsers from other vendors. <br><br>  Thirdly, it will be a social or professional search.  Today, finding a social circle aimed at discussing a particular topic and corresponding to individual needs is a non-trivial task.  It would seem where does the search?  Well, so, the design of the solution provides a search.  The rationale for its necessity based on the analysis of user processes is quite voluminous, I just mention it as a necessary part of the design.  With the search services for communication and user interaction will have more opportunities to offer themselves to the consumer and become more diverse and more developed. <br><br>  Mentioned already free choice forms of interaction or communication.  Tape, commenting, chat, voice chat, forum, articles, ads, specialized forms, individual messages, etc., all these types of social forms are used and popular on the network, and their preference by users is unpredictable. <br><br>  I have already mentioned notifications about new messages in topics of interest to you, activity in discussions or actions of other users, as a component of the browser and with a convenient display.  It is possible that other service objects of the subject area will be added. <br><br>  And other improvements.  It is assumed that this design will act as a basic technology and will be widely used by various services.  And I see a mechanism that (possibly) will lead to a qualitative leap in the development of social forms, this mechanism is the freedom of communication and free access (on a competitive basis) to the consumer of all providers of social forms. <br><br><h2>  How will it be implemented and how will we use it? </h2><br>  Having given such opportunity, we will allow to create new services.  There is no need to do anything special, new services advertise themselves.  As social services are spread, content sites will be able to re-link a number of their pages, simplifying them and making them more convenient.  After all, there will be no urgent need to introduce social forms everywhere, they will become external to the site.  Sites will be able to provide a more complex service, cooperating with each other.  For example, active wiki editors can use for their work organizers or other services provided by some third-party site on the network.  Or vice versa, a wiki site can provide its service to some other site. <br><br><h2>  Why do you think that someone will use it? </h2><br>  In the proposed improvement, that is, the introduction of a specialized panel, there is no revolutionism.  On the contrary, the requirement to break complex forms into several simpler ones is one of the main ones in GUI design.  And with the help of a social panel this requirement can be met.  And for the convenience and site developers will support and the user will be pulled. <br><br>  Another reason is the alternative possibility mentioned above.  If the social panel provides a choice, then the user traffic with its use will increase.  As an example, let's take a discussion of some event related to politics.  In one discussion, two sides clash, confrontation and dispute arise.  In this situation, there is a very large number of interrupted user processes, leaving the discussion.  Part because of moderation of messages, part - the defeated and disappointed or offended party leaves.  Yes, and the winners in the absence of the interlocutor also go.  In the case, if more sections are provided for discussion, thematic or for supporters of different political preferences, it will generate more traffic, simply because visitors will not be forced to leave.  That is, it is assumed that the panel offering an alternative will create more traffic. <br><br>  Social search will also attract visitors. <br><br><h2>  Summarize </h2><br>  I did not set myself the goal of fully describing the design in this article, just to identify the key points, and even then not everything.  This is an application, a challenge.  The task was to at least indicate the need and say that a solution is proposed for this need.  I hope more for the understanding of colleagues than for a simple reader who is far from the development or design.  It would be great to talk on the topic.  Questions, controversy, everything is welcome except for the negative and spitefulness.  Maybe the developer company of some browser will be interested, I would be happy to discuss the possibilities of implementation.  Moreover, there is still something to offer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/269089/">https://habr.com/ru/post/269089/</a></p>
