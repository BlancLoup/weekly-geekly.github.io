  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Trends of e-marketing for 2015, research and list of top tools from the company Smart Insights</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Consulting company Smart Insights works with the largest retailers in the world, such as Canon, Unilever, HP.  In his blog, the company's CEO, Dave Chaffey, <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/managing-digital-marketing/marketing-innovation/digital-marketing-trends-2015/">wrote</a> about how to improve and optimize marketing activity on the Internet and even gave a list of the necessary tools.  Below is a translation of this extremely useful material. <br>  ‚ÄúMy favorite reason for writing a blog is when I want to look into the future and try to predict the main trends of digital marketing next year.  It seems to me that many marketers are eager to learn everything about the latest trends, methods and technologies of marketing. <br>  For the past few years, I have been giving recommendations on trends, as I see them, on the basis of analyzing innovations in marketing technologies and studying the opinions of Smart Insights readers about what is important for them. <br>  When deciding whether there will be something in trends, I‚Äôm not just looking at whether it looks ‚Äúcool‚Äù.  First of all, I research the commercial benefit of this or that tool for online retailers.  In the end, most of us are engaged in marketing precisely in order to improve the business results of our clients or companies.  Here is the <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/managing-digital-marketing/marketing-innovation/marketing-trends-2014/">forecast of</a> last year.  This year, we also interviewed readers: <br><br>  <b>What tool of digital marketing, in your opinion, in 2015 will give you personally the greatest effect?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So what are the survey results?  For the second year in a row tops the list of content marketing tools.  But he was on one of the first places to SMM and mobile marketing.  In fact, he even rose to several positions due to the fact that the SMM and mobile marketing reduced their sphere of influence as soon as market participants reduced their importance.  It is important that Big Data is still in second place, although this year the hype has declined.  I think this may be the reason for the introduction of data mining companies in their marketing activities, especially if we consider that in the third place in the survey is automation of marketing activities.  In the last part of this article, I will look at different tools for working with marketing analytics, reporting, and data management. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bd/164/4fb/5bd1644fbe1046cb8677a76d49c9a518.png">

      <b>Trends in digital marketing tools and technologies</b> <br><br>  Speaking about the trends of past years, I researched mainly innovations and trends in the use of top-level e-marketing methods such as content marketing, search, email and work on the website.  But, frankly, over the years, the basic principles are not changing so much.  Because this year, in my post about trends, I want to look at the tools and services that help in marketing. <br>  All these services are focused on analyzing data that is potentially important to a business.  They cover a wide range from analytics to optimization of trade channels, but the first few are devoted to content marketing, as I believe it will be the most important and most interesting tool in the coming year. <br><br>  <b>10 key marketing services in 2015</b> <br><br>  Many trends force marketers to search for services, services and software for managing, optimizing and analyzing activities.  Here is a list of useful tools that I have already presented to partners and clients at the art Insights Digital Impact marketing conference, the full presentation can be found at the <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/managing-digital-marketing/marketing-innovation/digital-marketing-trends-2015/">link</a> . <br><br>  <b>1. Content management tools</b> <br>  A great effect is given by the publication of micro and video content.  Not surprisingly, the number of sites for such publications has increased and it is difficult to manage all of them manually.  And completely unnecessary, a lot of software created specifically to automate these processes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfb/387/bbe/cfb387bbe4fa4e07bc4d91762d4aea69.png"><br><br>  Here are three of them: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.percolate.com/">Percolate</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.curata.com/">Curata</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.kapost.com/">Kapost</a> </li></ul><br>  <b>2. Tools for recommendation, personalization, retargeting and content performance analysis</b> <br>  Even if you have created great content, you still need to show it to someone who is interested in it.  This will help dynamic recommendations of the most relevant content.  For a long time, the site's personalization was used to configure the online stores and display products and offers that are relevant for the client.  But never before has this technology been so popular for content personalization.  Tools for this: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.idioplatform.com/">idio</a> (B2B and B2C content recommendation) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.barilliance.com/">Barilliance</a> (personalized content for e-commerce) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.demandbase.com/">Demandbase</a> (B2B) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.monetate.com/">Monetate</a> (Ecommerce) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.evergage.com/">Evergage</a> (B2B and B2C) </li></ul><br>  <b>3. Services for content distribution</b> <br>  Under the distribution of content here is meant organic and paid sharing through social networks.  In this list are services for organic shearing: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://hootsuite.com/">Hootsuite</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://sendible.com/">Sendible</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.oktopost.com/">Oktopost</a> </li></ul><br>  It's amazing how little the market for products for the paid distribution of content.  One of the most popular in this sense is AdRoll.  Maybe you can recommend this service? <br><br>  <b>4. SEO, content and social media management tools?</b> <br>  Question mark here because so far this is an unattainable dream.  The tools that I will recommend here arose as SEO services for checking keywords and backlinks, but now they have added some functions for working with social networks and content management.  They also provide convenient work for several people on the same project.  But their main function is SEO analytics. <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://moz.com/">Moz</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://raventools.com/">Raven Tools</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.analyticsseo.com/">SEO analytics</a> </li></ul><br>  <b>5. API integration tools</b> <br>  API - a set of tools for integration between different platforms.  It is the key factor in the purchase of any tool for implementation.  There are no examples of specific tools.  Only attempts by platform manufacturers to integrate other services into their own to increase its value.  CRM services, for example, with Adobe Analytics (in the past Omniture), are particularly good at this. <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.act-on.com/">Act-on</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.marketo.com/">Marketo</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> </li></ul><br>  <b>6. Optimizing the involvement and analysis of user behavior on the site</b> <br>  Most companies use web analytics to track visits to their sites.  The most popular free, but very powerful system for this is Google Analytics.  In it, you get information about the number of users, their source and the path through the site, but the problem and limitation is that this data cannot be segmented by user types.  They are not intended for research of a specific client or their group, tracking differences in behavior from different devices, operating systems and browsers (although Google‚Äôs latest analytics is making progress in this area).  Below is a list of tools for sensitively tracking the behavior of user groups or specific customers: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.kissmetrics.com/">Kissmetrics</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://chartbeat.com/">Chartbeat</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.orderdynamics.com/">Ecommera</a> (renamed OrderDynamics) </li></ul><br>  <b>7. Realizable and clear analytics</b> <br>  There is another limitation in Google Analytics and services from clause 6.  They require a lot of experience in analytics in order to understand how to use the data provided.  To use them qualitatively, you need to know in advance the right questions, the answers to which you will be looking for in the analytics, understand how to set up the tool, obtain and interpret multidimensional and complex reports.  Only a specialist can quickly figure it out and truly understand such tools.  Here will help tools that more clearly provide the data: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1320491%3Fhl%3Den">Google Analytics Intelligence and Alerts</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://quillengage.narrativescience.com/">Quill engage</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/">Smart insights</a> </li></ul><br>  <b>8. From conversion optimization to custom path optimization</b> <br>  We are in Smart Insights, longtime fans of A / B and multivariate testing.  Unfortunately, these excellent tools are focused on optimizing a particular page in the user's path, and not on improving his way through the site as a whole.  However, now there are many services that help to understand how, in general, the user behaves on the site and facilitate his path from the landing page to the final goal. <br>  Most popular A / B testing tools: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vwo.com/%3Fv%3D3">Visual Website Optimizer</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://unbounce.com/">Unbounce</a> </li></ul><br>  Tools for tracking and analyzing the entire path of a site visitor: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ua/solutions/web-experience-management.html">Adobe Customer Experience Manager</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.episerver.com/">EPiServer</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.sitecore.net/">Sitecore</a> </li></ul><br>  <b>9. Optimization of sales channels</b> <br>  E-commerce management platforms focus on big business, which trades with delivery to the consumer home, as well as on the pages of categories and products, as described in our <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/guides/ecommerce-design-patterns/">Ecommerce Design Bible</a> .  <a href="http://clavisinsight.com/">Clavis Insights</a> is a relatively new, but already expensive, mechanism that shows retailers and brands commercial analytics to help optimize sales channels and methods. <br><br>  <b>10. Wearable devices, augmented and virtual reality</b> <br>  Finally, we come to cool and ‚Äúhot‚Äù technologies.  I kept them until the last, because I believe that they will play the smallest commercial role for entrepreneurs.  They will be released in 2015, so, in any case, it will be extremely fascinating to observe new marketing trends associated with these technologies: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/WatchKitProgrammingGuide/DesigningaWatchKitApp.html">Apple Watch Apps</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass</a> (at the time of this writing, it was not yet announced the closure of the GoogleGlass project) </li><li>  Facebook <a href="https://www.oculus.com/">Oculus Rift</a> </li></ul><br>  I hope you will find time to test and evaluate at least some of these tools and they will prove useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251043/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251043/</a></p>
