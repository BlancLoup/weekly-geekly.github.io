Let's think about what these options are and how to live with it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Restrictions </h4><br>  There are two options for development: <br>  1) Chinese; <br>  2) North Korean; <br><br>  In the first version, we will create a monitoring system for the entire Internet (with the exception of P2P) and everything that does not satisfy the rules will be blocked. 
      <br>

      The second option, on the contrary, implies a break in the <b>physical</b> connectivity of the Russian network with the foreign one. <br>  Previously, no one would have thought that the Runet could go on the second option, but at the moment it is he who is implemented with some amendments. <br><br><h4>  Why the second option, but not the first? </h4><br>  The article, published by the link above, says that you need to be prepared for the fact that connectedness can disappear.  In other words, if that cherished button for disabling links is pressed, within the country most resources should work as before.  It is quite obvious that it is necessary to build a semi-autonomous system. <br><br><h5>  Semi-autonomous system </h5><br>  This system, which should not be dependent on external DNS - several root (ROOT) DNS have long been established in Russia, you can receive data from them (by external DNS you mean where provider DNS send requests for domain resolution). <br><br>  In addition, 90% of system resources should be available when uplinks are disabled to <s>civilized</s> other countries. <br><br>  Here are the top 25 resources in RU: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">TOP 25</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href="http://imgur.com/ANTGCFu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/059/945/7c3/0599457c3619970e05ff0d8f1e991826.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com"></a> <br> <a href="http://imgur.com/E1P8ALz"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fe/913/343/6fe9133436d3ff73d6ad710c5c3ccee6.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com"></a> <br> <a href="http://imgur.com/IU2S3pY"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f79/1cf/37a/f791cf37a0efe10aa355045207e0d0ab.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com"></a> <br></div></div><br>  Virtually all resources are located in Russia or use a CDN, which is located in Russia (youtube, Vkontakte is building a CDN). <br><br>  But the semi-autonomous system is in fact ‚Äúgender‚Äù, that it should provide access to the large Internet for legal entities when undergoing a certain procedure. <br><br>  In other words, practically everything is already ready to lower the digital curtain. <br><br><h4>  But let's not panic.  How to deal with it? </h4><br>  For a comprehensive fight, you need to have two weapons: P2P and the second level encrypted on the OSI model. <br><br>  When using P2P networks, all content is transferred from user to user, if without a link break each person could receive content from abroad, now units will be able to, but they will bring it to the network.  As soon as this happens - within the network this content will be synchronized with all devices on the network. <br><br>  There are several methods to receive content across the border: two-way satellite Internet, (WI-FI / cable) bridges across the border with further wrapping in anonymous or pseudo-anonymous networks. <br><br>  In other words, if suddenly the scenario described above is implemented in Russia, then to install a channel for data transfer, you will need: <br><br>  1) Find a country with which we have no border and in which the Internet is freer - (the whole CIS); <br>  2) Connect to this country; <br>  3) Wrap traffic between Russia &lt;-&gt; country in VPN / CJDNS; <br>  4) Take a server abroad and make the following connection: <br><br>  <i>(For example, we take the server on UNIX in Europe, and as a donor country for the free Internet, we mean Belarus)</i> <br><br>  UNIX server in EU &lt;- CJDNS (TUNNEL) -&gt; Belarus (server) &lt;- CJDNS (WI-FI bridge or wires) -&gt; Resident of the nearest city in Russia &lt;- CJDNS -&gt; All other people who want to connect. <br><br>  I want to remind that the CJDNS protocol has dynamic routing, which means that there can be a lot of such holes and each hole will be: <br><br>  1) Hide who made it from Belarus (if you go to a regular website through this tunnel, you will see the IP from the EU); <br>  2) Hide intermediate resources, because  they will not appear in direct routing (over IP); <br>  3) Automatically balance load; <br>  4) You will not need to configure routing. <br><br><h4>  Why there will be many holes </h4><br>  "Holes" will be of different origin - based on enthusiasts - as I described above, and personal. <br><br>  Not many people in the country will have access to the large web (for work), but those who have access will have SSH and VPN access, and traffic inside these protocols is encrypted, and no one bothers you except drive your work traffic through this hole also other information. <br><br>  I remind you of the popular <b>OpenSource</b> P2P projects that deserve your attention: <br><br>  1) TOX - messenger protected from wiretapping with audio / video connection - <a href="http://tox.im/">tox.im</a> <br>  2) Twister - P2P microblogging - ( <a href="https://github.com/iShift/twister-webkit/releases/">Bundle for Windows</a> \ <a href="https://github.com/miguelfreitas/twister-core/">Source code</a> for building on other platforms). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237365/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237365/</a></p>
