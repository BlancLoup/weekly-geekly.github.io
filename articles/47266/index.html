  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of programs that allow you to send SMS with the substitution of the sender's number.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b03/bff/aac/b03bffaacb4e314bab901e9f2fb61b02.jpg"><br>  I accidentally found out about the ability to send SMS on behalf of anyone.  They wanted to play a friend with friends and I decided to search the Internet - is it really possible?  It turned out that this service is quite common.  The price of such SMS ranges from 3-5 to several tens of rubles.  As a result of searches and numerous tests, it turned out that everything is not so simple.  As a result, and help to those who want to be able to send SMS with the substitution of numbers, publish a small overview of the software that I could find.  Immediately, I‚Äôm noting that I was looking for programs, and not sending SMS from a website, because  All sites that were found offered to send an SMS to a short number in order to be able to send.  This method is not credible - one, and the high price - two. <br><br>  Now about the programs found in the order of their issuance by Yandex. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. SMSBomba and other viruses. </h4><br>  The first was a product called <b>SMSBomba</b> .  Directly on the site you can not send SMS with substitution - they offer to download their program.  Downloaded.  When trying to install, DrWeb reported that a trojan in the archive, ‚Äúsmsbomba.exe, is infected with Trojan.Fakesms.6,‚Äù so the program was not considered further. <br><br>  In this review I cite it only as an example of the need to use antivirus when searching for this kind of software.  I came across a few more programs with a virus, I will not talk about everyone.

        </script>
      <br>
    <h4>  2. SmsTool </h4><br>  The second thing that caught my eye - <b>SmsTool</b> .  There is no site of its own, the program is located in soft directories.  The ability to send SMS with the substitution of the authors stated. <br><br>  Downloaded.  Result at startup: <br><br><img src="http://s50.radikal.ru/i130/0812/e3/591b787ec10c.jpg"><br><br>  As far as I understood, some libraries are missing.  Well, it means no luck.  We continue our search. <br><br><h4>  3. SendSMS3 </h4><br>  The third program that I came <b>across</b> is <b>SendSMS3</b> from <a href="http://www.sidec.ru/">www.sidec.ru</a> <br><br>  The program features declared support for sending with the substitution.  The site is more or less normal, happy to shake.  But unfortunately I get: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/322/a0b/b49/322a0bb49dbf72f746beda1bdb41bafb.jpg"><br><br>  I thought that I could even send an ordinary SMS - it was not there.  It was not possible to send to Peter MTS - ‚Äúnumber error, operator is not supported.‚Äù After several attempts, ‚ÄúSuccessfully sent.‚Äù  SMS is not.  I tried several more times.  Still "successful", but did not receive the SMS.  As a result, received the message "Stop spamming."  And SMS is still waiting. <br><br>  In general, everything is beautiful - and the site and the program.  Impressions are positive.  Only one minus does not work :) <br><br><h4>  4. Coyote </h4><br>  Well, let's go further.  The following program <b>Coyote 0.3.0.2 sms.</b>  Program site - <a href="http://www.cwer.ru/coyote_0_3_0_2">www.cwer.ru/coyote_0_3_0_2</a> . <br><br>  In spite of the fact that Yandex issued it as a supporting dispatch with the substitution of a number, I did not find any mention of this on the author‚Äôs website.  I decided to download, watch.  Sorry, but really not.  However, all the declared functions work - SMS sends.  But this is not what I needed, so go ahead. <br><br><h4>  5. TipTopSMSWin <br></h4><br>  The following is a program <b>TipTopSMSWin v2.8</b> .  from the site <a href="http://tip-top-sms.ru/">tip-top-sms.ru</a> <br><br>  Honestly, the possibilities were pleasantly surprised - up to the opportunity to receive a response to the SMS.  However, I retired from the topic.  The program declared the possibility of sending with the substitution.  So swing. <br><br><img src="http://s40.radikal.ru/i089/0812/89/b00dde19fe4a.jpg"><br><br>  The interface, compared with previous programs is very simple and straightforward.  I try to send an SMS with a substitution - and indeed, in less than a couple of minutes, I received an SMS from my friend, from whose number I sent an SMS. <br><br>  Honestly, I didn‚Äôt even believe it. <br><br>  In general, not bad, but we continue to search further. <br><br><h4>  6. Miscellaneous </h4><br>  The next two programs disappeared immediately, because  do not support sending with substitution. <br><br>  <b>Smsdv v1.8</b> <a href="http://smsdv.narod.ru/">smsdv.narod.ru</a> <br><br>  <b>SMS-Sendor v2.4</b> <a href="http://www.sms-sendor.com.ru/">www.sms-sendor.com.ru</a> <br><br>  Download them and did not try. <br><br><h4>  7. Yakoon <br></h4><br>  Next came the program <b>Yakoon v2.0</b> from the site <a href="http://www.yakoon.com/">www.yakoon.com</a> <br>  Immediately I was seduced by the low price and the announced possibility of changing the number. <br>  We swing.  The interface was quite pleasant, but exclusively in English. <br><br><img src="http://s55.radikal.ru/i148/0812/71/0193424b9dd4.jpg"><br><br>  On tests gave 3 SMS.  SMS with the substitution of numbers - reached, but after a positive experience, I am no longer surprised <br><br>  More search on Yandex did not give anything. <br><br><h4>  Summary. </h4><br>  Actually, only two programs were able to send an SMS with the substitution of the number, and as a result we can compare them. <br><br>  <b>TipTopSMSWin</b> <br><br>  <i>Pros:</i> <ul><li>  Works. </li><li>  Many additional features </li><li>  There is a starting bonus of 30 rubles. </li><li>  There are 3 free SMS per day. </li><li>  Convenient payment system. </li><li>  If SMS cannot be delivered, the money is not withdrawn. </li><li>  A large number of operators. </li><li>  Does not require installation. </li><li>  There is a program not only under Windows, but also for the phone. </li><li>  They promise a program for PDAs. </li><li>  Office in Russia, support live. </li><li>  Simple, intuitive interface </li><li>  There is an API for integration into your website. </li></ul>  <i>Minuses:</i> <ul><li>  The cost of an SMS is higher than that of Yakoon. </li></ul>  Website: <a href="http://tip-top-sms.ru/">tip-top-sms.ru</a> <br>  Download: <a href="">tip-top-sms.ru/sms.rar</a> <br><br>  <b>Yakoon</b> <br><br>  <i>Pros:</i> <ul><li>  Works. </li><li>  Many additional features </li><li>  3 free SMS at registration. </li><li>  Quite a large number of operators. </li><li>  There is an API for integration into your website. </li></ul>  <i>Minuses:</i> <ul><li>  If delivery is not possible - the money is written off as sent by SMS. </li><li>  For Russia, there is only one payment method. </li><li>  Money goes very long. </li><li>  No Russian interface. </li><li>  Installation required. </li><li>  The office is not in Russia, the support letter is not responding. </li></ul>  Website: <a href="http://www.yakoon.com/">www.yakoon.com</a> <br>  Download: <a href="">www.yakoon.com/Download/yakoon-2.0.0.213-setup.exe</a> <br><br>  Most of the SMS shipments were tested on MTS Peter. <br><br>  In general, there is plenty to choose from.  Decide for yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47266/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47266/</a></p>
