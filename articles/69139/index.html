In winter it is colder, there is a lot of rain, it is possible to snow and ice in the mountains. <br>  <b>- Perhaps the appearance of snow in northern California?</b>  <b>If there is ice, will the car's behavior change?</b> <br><br>  The weather corresponds to the real weather in California for one randomly selected year.  In winter, snow and ice in the mountains are possible.  Especially dangerous for the driver is the "Black Ice".  This is a thin transparent crust of ice on the pavement.  Externally, it looks the same as the usual wet road.  Truckers determine this effect by the absence of spray from other machines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/650/5b0/5cf/6505b05cfd9395f64f372c542bea3e13.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>- Will there be a mafia in the game?</b>  <b>If so, will she be mortal?</b> <br><br>  With the mafia will have to meet.  The player will be able to choose his own path - go aside and fight.  Mafia is mortal.  But also the main character is mortal. <br><br>  <b>- Offenses will be considered only as driveways to a red light and an accident, or will there be a more real binding to the rules?</b> <br><br>  The game implemented a fairly large sample of the California traffic rules.  A full implementation would be pointless, since in real life the work of the American truck driver is very strictly regulated.  Therefore, some of the restrictions have been removed.  You can familiarize yourself with the short reference book on the California traffic rules on the official website of the ‚ÄúTruckers‚Äù in the ‚ÄúTips‚Äù section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71c/ff5/06a/71cff506a0cfde541b27b59c35da84f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>- Has the overlap of road sections (or parts of lanes) been implemented due to the occurrence of an accident?</b>  <b>Will there be natural disasters?</b> <br><br>  Any accident can lead to traffic jams, as the traffic in the game is quite dense.  Special overlaps of stripes or roads are not performed in the game.  There are no typhoons and tornadoes. <br><br>  <b>- The police will "hunt" only for the player or the AI, too, can get under the police all-seeing eye?</b> <br><br>  Even in the event of an accident, the police may consider the culprit not a player, but another driver. <br><br>  <b>- Will there be cameras in the "Truckers-3" to control the speed as in the "Truckers-2"?</b> <br><br>  No, there are no obvious radars in the game.  But special drivers can ‚Äúpawn‚Äù special drivers. <br><br>  <b>- Will it be possible to bribe the police in 3 parts of the game?</b> <br><br>  Not.  We do not recommend this to anyone on the real road in California.  You can easily go to jail to thunder.  Even the question of the amount of the fine puzzles the policeman.  This is decided by the court.  Where we were invited for speeding in one of the trips. <br><br>  <b>- Will there be traffic jams?</b> <br><br>  In the game settings there is a special parameter "Intensity of movement."  Naturally, with more cars and inadequate player actions, traffic jams are inevitable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/951/9cb/f2e/9519cbf2e609b7e851010a7ca590a9c8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>- How many cameras in the cabin of the truck?</b>  <b>From what angle you can watch?</b>  <b>Is it possible to turn the head?</b> <br><br>  There are two cameras in the cabin: from the driver‚Äôs seat and from the sleeping bag.  You can turn your head and change the zoom of the camera with the mouse. <br>  <b>- Will be implemented turn signals and emergency gang?</b> <br><br>  Yes, and the turn signals are switched off when changing directions, as well as on a real car. <br><br>  <b>- Will all the indicators on the dashboard work?</b>  <b>If oil leaks in case of engine damage, will the indicator on the dashboard come on?</b> <br><br>  Yes, all key sensors and dashboard lights are functional.  Having an idea about the device of the machine, you can determine the malfunction yourself and even prevent the development of a serious problem. <br><br>  <b>- Will communication through the radio between the drivers?</b> <br><br>  Yes.  According to CB Bi radio it will be possible to receive a bunch of useful information (unexpected orders, delivery details, requests for help, warnings, etc.) and respond promptly to it. <br><br>  <b>- Will it be possible to sleep in a truck sleeping bag?</b> <br><br>  A modern Californian trucker sleeps in a motel.  A luxurious sleeping bag is rather a tribute to tradition.  Punitive measures for lack of rest are removed from the game, although this is one of the basic rules governing the work of the American trucker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f59/c06/d2b/f59c06d2b0d5b9a61ba4848a33f0040f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>- Will there be a partner in the game sitting in the passenger seat telling jokes and sometimes working as an autopilot if the player wants to rest.</b> <br><br>  No, we will not have a permanent partner.  But similar functions will be performed by colorful fellow travelers, whom we will meet in bars, restaurants or just on the track.  <b>- What will happen if the gamer does not meet during the delivery of the passenger and generally takes him not to the right place.</b>  <b>Will the passenger entertain the player with talking</b> <br><br>  If we do not fit in time or deliver an inconvenience to a passenger, he will refuse to continue with us, ask to disembark it and, of course, will not pay anything.  If everything is in order, then we will certainly be waiting for a dialogue, perhaps a new interesting task, etc. <br>  <b>- Will the player be able to use systems such as engine braking, trailer;</b>  <b>Cruise control;</b>  <b>differential lock, etc.?</b> <br><br>  Yes, including the special Engine Break system, which is popular for long haul trucks.  This is especially important on steep slopes, where the use of conventional brakes can lead to a rapid burning of the pads.  There are no differential locks for the trucks used in the game.  Cruise control is adaptive;  it takes into account the distance to the vehicles ahead and, if necessary, slows down.  The game has a lot of other upgrades that affect driver safety and driving performance. <br>  <b>- Is the damage to the coupling mechanisms implemented in the tractor / trailer, will this affect the reliability of the coupling?</b>  <b>Are there any damage to the coupling power cables?</b>  <b>Are trailer brakes and breakdowns implemented?</b>  <b>Will this affect the behavior of the composition?</b> <br><br>  Hitch system damage implemented.  The braking of the semi-trailer (first work out the contours of the semi-trailer, then the contours of the tractor) was not implemented.  In general, damage to semi-trailers is given less attention than damage to machines.  The semitrailers in the game are owned by the California Baza Association and other customers, so the player doesn‚Äôt have a particular need to monitor their condition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/838/35f/5ce/83835f5ce5886d4430ce2e20e25ddabc.jpg" alt="image">  <b>- Will there be damage to cars in auto transporters?</b>  <b>Will fuel tanks explode on impact?</b>  <b>Will gas stations explode?</b> <br><br>  Yes, cars are very expensive goods, so damage to them during transportation is fraught with large penalties.  Tanks and gas stations do not explode.  Barrels of flammable substances explode, and their flames can even spread to a car standing nearby. <br><br>  <b>- Will the semblance of technical inspection be taken into account?</b> <br><br>  At each service station, the player will be able to get a detailed diagnostic report on the status of his car.  There are no punitive measures for the inappropriate state of the machine in the game.  <b>- Will the trucks of other truckers and mercenaries of the company break down in the same way?</b> <br><br>  Yes, they will.  And not only to break, but also to wear out, if they possess large runs. <br><br>  <b>- What are the fundamental differences between the "simulator" and "arcade" mode?</b>  <b>Will the physics of car movement change when changing these modes?</b> <br><br>  The game has three levels of difficulty - ‚Äúnovice‚Äù (or 4-wheeler, as professional truckers of motorists are contemptuously called), ‚Äútrucker‚Äù and ‚Äúexpert‚Äù.  As the level of complexity increases, the game becomes more and more contrast: the allowable delivery time decreases, bonuses increase, penalties increase, competitors become more aggressive, and police become more assertive.  The physics of the machines and the grip parameters are becoming increasingly realistic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d98/927/0e1/d989270e171e3071392d3b66432d0361.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>- Is it possible to buy cars?</b> <br><br>  No, the game is dedicated to truckers, so we decided not to mix genres and not to turn the game into a traditional racing simulator. <br><br>  <b>- It was said that the fleet has changed.</b>  <b>Is it possible to edit the list of cars on the site in accordance with the changes?</b>  <b>Naturally, with all sorts of screenshots at max settings.</b> <br><br>  A similar update is being prepared and will be published soon. <br><br>  <b>- Will there be an opportunity to ride a truck with a trailer and without cargo?</b> <br><br>  All trailers in the game will be loaded with one or another load before the player receives them.  As a result of successful delivery, the shipment will be transferred to the customer.  In case of unsuccessful delivery, the player may hang out with the trailer for some time. <br>  <b>- At the service and loading stations can I see other drivers?</b> <br><br>  Yes, it will be possible to see how the drivers drive into the loading station and leave.  Also sometimes trucks and trailers of other drivers will be parked near the bars.  In the latter case, it is possible that there will be a delivery assignment for us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/860/479/965/86047996576333eb6ee5c943230d8c28.jpg" alt="image">  <b>- Will it be possible to give any commands to drivers from their company, that is, to mercenaries.</b> <br><br>  The player is available strategic management of the company.  Those.  he determines - what types of orders a particular driver must fulfill, which car from the player‚Äôs fleet is more suitable for him, what salary should be set for him.  The player must "calculate" the talents of their driver in order to optimize profits. <br>  <b>- Will the price of fuel change at a single gas station?</b> <br><br>  No, fuel prices at a particular gas station do not change during the game.  But different gas stations offer fuel at different prices. <br><br>  <b>- It is known that when we drive through different parts of the state, we will hear the appropriate music on the radio station, and will we be able to switch the FM receiver on our own?</b>  <b>Can I hear Russian on the radio?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f32/807/b72/f32807b72e82e24e0cb8a0075ed69da1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Yes, you can switch the receiver, or simply turn it off, if you prefer to do your work to the sound of the motor.  Of course, it is the Russian language that will be heard on the radio (at least in the Russian version of the game). <br>  <b>- Will there be a digital distribution of the game?</b> <br><br>  This question is the responsibility of the publisher. <br><br>  <b>- Will there be support for TrackIR?</b> <br><br>  Yes, the game supports TrackIR.  In addition, the game supports three monitor displays using the TripleHead2Go device from Matrox. <br>  <b>- Windows 7 is not far off. Will Truckers 3 fully support it?</b> <br><br>  Yes, and testing the game under the release version of Windows 7 is already underway. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d1/9d6/caf/7d19d6caf2720ff63faa454beb13fb66.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>- Now the trend has started even among domestic developers to release their games on the consoles of the new generation.</b>  <b>Do you plan to release the game on consoles, and if so, on which ones?</b> <br><br>  We think about this perspective and are interested in the capabilities of all consoles of the current generation.  But so far, "Truckers" remain PC-exclusive.  Perhaps in the future the project will become multiplatform. <br>  <b>- Will there be some kind of map editor, go sdk?</b> <br><br>  No, the level editor has not been planned yet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/612/386/f5c/612386f5c3d9d8fe4ff488acd7e2df6a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also, I would like to remind (those who knew) or inform (respectively, those who did not know) that a second interview is being prepared, therefore I am waiting for questions in the comments ... I will answer something right here ... <br><br><h4>  <b>Interview Source: <a href="http://gameguru.ru/">GameGuru.ru</a></b> </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69139/</a></p>
