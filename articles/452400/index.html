This crap is written, probably on the website of each company.  Only for some reason this asset is used only ... Stop, it does not matter further.  Only used. <br><br>  It is behind the machine, sitting at the computer, lying under the car.  It is desirable - silently.  And what will happen if the mouth opens?  Well, at best - nothing.  If you give any idea about improvements, what will happen?  Well, you know this old saying.  Therefore, silent. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/3h/iq/zv3hiqcrnc8uruvtcdrwtlzrs1k.jpeg"></div><br>  At the same time, almost every company has a mechanism for collecting these very ideas and proposals.  Approximately how it was in <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421023/">‚ÄúCorporate Schizophrenia‚Äù</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422361/">‚ÄúCorporate Syndrome‚Äù</a> .  Any box, electronic or physical, equipped with a formalized procedure for receiving, processing and, of course, recycling offers of employees. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  And you? </h4><br>  Any employee, one way or another, is in the position of "do what they said and how they said."  If you are not the head of the company, and you think that this is not about you, take a test.  To start, try to express an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow you can improve your own work.  Perhaps your idea will be supported (entrusting the implementation to you, of course).  Although it may seem silly to express such an idea - since you know how to work better, then work, there is nothing to ‚Äúspeak out‚Äù.

      And now try to suggest an improvement in the work of your colleague.  And then - his boss.  If you have the courage, then try to analyze and suggest improvements in the work of the adjacent unit.  Then another function, such as accounting or finance.  Maybe the head of the company will reach out. <br><br>  What stage will you stop at?  Or stop?  I think somewhere between the first and second.  In your head, for sure, there are two legitimate questions.  The first - what for it to me.  Second, how do I know how to improve their work? <br><br>  The answer to the first question is formed by the environment - the one described above.  You do not need all this, because no one needs all this.  Nobody needs your ideas.  No one will listen to them and, moreover, bring them to life. <br><br>  The answer to the second question is you are cunning.  If you are a programmer, even a timlid, even a sysadmin, even a manager, you know how to improve the work of any department.  There are people there too, exactly the same as you.  They have exactly the same problems as you, just maybe another professional color.  The basic, atomic and universal entities on which any activity is based, have not gone away - tasks, regular projects, projects, deadlines, processes.  If you are pulled out of work, brought to any hackathon, ‚Äúsuggest improvements for such and such a business,‚Äù you will surely be among the winners. <br><br><h4>  Slaughter of ideas </h4><br>  We, ‚Äúbelow,‚Äù believe that there, ‚Äúabove,‚Äù do not need our ideas.  In the same place the cleverest people of the company, the most effective managers, with diplomas and degrees sit.  Sometimes this is true - as a rule, if there is an owner there, and the company is relatively small or has been established recently.  The owner has not yet pulled away from the routine, knows the business far and wide, keeps abreast of the market, monitors competitors. <br><br>  As soon as, and the more he delegates, the number of ideas begins to decrease rapidly.  There, above, tasks and execution come to power.  What happens with the tasks further - you know yourself.  They go down. <br><br>  Any idea that comes from above or below dies.  More precisely, it is killed - there are lots of proven methods.  It‚Äôs easiest to launch the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa boss in a hell of a circle of analysis, research, probing the market, formalization in the form of a project, etc.  Even the ideas that the owner, as they say, burn, gradually sink.  All managers know - you just need to stretch a little longer with the analysis, and burn out. <br><br>  The idea that came from a miracle from below is the easiest to blame for lack of professionalism and narrow horizons.  It seems like a dude, of course, something is right, but it's not so simple there.  Let's declare gratitude to him, give a letter, and forget.  The second method is to entrust the execution to the initiator.  Do not give, of course, the budget, do not provide assistance, a couple of sticks in the wheel insert.  So that others were discouraged. <br><br><h4>  Like-killer </h4><br>  The third method is the most effective, I call it "Like."  This is just a bomb.  He came from social networks, management books and social aspirin like Dale Carnegie. <br><br>  We heard, probably, recommendations from the series: in relations with subordinates there should be a proportion between praise and swearing.  I don‚Äôt remember the exact numbers, let it be ‚Äú1 time to scold, 4 times to praise.‚Äù  So, this is the praise - Like.  Nothing significant mark. <br><br>  It‚Äôs very easy to make likes - ‚Äúgreat idea!‚Äù, ‚ÄúOh, what an interesting offer!‚Äù, ‚ÄúWell done!‚Äù, Etc.  Unfortunately, the recipient likes the thought that his idea was approved, supported, appreciated.  Unfortunately no.  He just liked it, because it‚Äôs so accepted, necessary, recommended or recommended. <br><br>  In fact, the likes never turn into anything.  In one company where I worked, I was bribed by these likes - they really loved giving them away.  And I loved generating ideas.  More precisely, I loved it when I started getting huskies for them. <br><br>  At first they were enthusiastic likes.  Then - routine huskies.  Then - tired huskies.  In the end - annoyed huskies.  Ideas at the same time just flew away into the void, like fireworks - cool, beautiful, like!  A minute later, the smoke dissipates, the projectile wasted. <br><br>  Likes - evil.  It is better to kill the idea on the spot, at least it's fair.  Huskies lead through the maze blindfolded until the person himself understands that everyone does not care about his ideas.  They give rise to hope, and then they kill her.  It remains an unpleasant aftertaste, as if you were deceived. <br><br><h4>  Ideas crisis </h4><br>  With all this, at the top there is a real crisis of ideas, and it is aggravated by a conflict of interests. <br>  On the one hand, as written above, the management tries to kill all the ideas, just in case.  Well, as someone stepped on Danko's heart.  On the other hand, their own, managerial ideas are not enough.  And something needs to be done. <br><br>  If the business is stable and well-established, then, like, and to hell with it.  It works, and okay.  Until the next crisis. <br><br>  I apologize for the tautology, but the crisis of ideas is especially visible at the moment of crisis.  Have you ever participated in management meetings in the fall of 2008 or 2014?  Or at a strategic session, brainstorming about the withdrawal of the company from the crisis?  Do not remember what ideas are mainly discussed there? <br><br>  The first and foremost is cost reduction.  The first and main article for cost reduction is payroll.  Then there are all sorts of trivial matters, such as reducing the number of business trips, cutting down budgets for development projects, selling illiquid assets for scrap, etc. <br><br>  The measures offered are so obvious and short-term that the student could cope with it.  On the one hand, everything seems to be correct - the crisis, there is no time to deal with the optimization of processes.  On the other hand, where were you before, before the crisis?  Past, populist question - what now snot on the fist to wind?  It is necessary to save the company.  But the most interesting thing to come. <br><br>  The crisis has passed, growth has gone again.  It seems, it is necessary to exhale, calmly calm down and re-assemble.  We need development ideas that will move the company forward and reduce the consequences of the risks of the following crises - either they will reduce the likelihood or the consequences will ease.  For example, through diversification, international markets, or the optimization of a business model. <br><br>  But, alas, there will be no second meeting.  Somehow, at a regular strategic session, with a fashionable moderator, brainstorming will be held on the edge of edge, on the flipchart will be recorded somewhere overlooked, randomly heard phrases like ‚Äúoptimize business processes‚Äù, ‚Äúimplement project or matrix management‚Äù, ‚Äú add a drop of edgyl ‚Äù,‚Äú analyze new markets ‚Äù, etc. <br><br><h4>  What ideas are being introduced? </h4><br>  Well, can not it be that everything is so bad?  Can not, I agree.  Some ideas are introduced and implemented.  In each industry there is such a short list.  Only these are not ideas. <br><br>  For example, a manufacturing plant is building a new site.  Or buying new machines.  Implements an ERP system.  Creates a website. <br><br>  Are these ideas?  To be honest, I do not know the answer, the line between the idea and the task generated by natural development is too thin. <br><br>  Approximately, as at small children.  Here he is still a crumb, lying like mother put.  And then suddenly begins to crawl.  Is this an idea?  Then he sits down.  Again - an idea?  Or natural development, like all? <br><br>  Brushing your teeth in the morning - what's the idea?  Gasoline in the car to fill?  Oh, and now everyone is driving to an independent car wash, even premium SUVs - maybe I can try?  Great idea? <br><br>  Ideas are good, but do not create a competitive advantage.  Although, sensible people say that in Russia it is enough to just produce a normal product for success.  I would argue, of course, but it sounds convincing.  Perhaps because of that ‚Äúeverything is just like everyone else.‚Äù  It is difficult to find an enterprise that would be strikingly different from others within its industry.  There are some minor differences, such as repairs in the toilet, but otherwise - as a blueprint. <br><br><h4>  Comb </h4><br>  But, at the same time, there is one strange phenomenon - leveling effect of ideas.  Here you look at the two plants, as they say, from a bird's eye view - for example, discussing upcoming automation and examining the process map - and it seems that there is nothing new here.  Then you look narrowly, and you understand that it is not right. <br><br>  One factory can have great purchases.  The other has modern, automated, high-tech sales.  The third one offers such loyalty programs that employees are ready to tear their teeth for their native plant or owner.  In the fourth, a unique system of motivation, as much as possible taking into account both personal and team flag.  The fifth plant is so successful in scaling or capturing the market that you wonder. <br><br>  And then you come back to the height of bird flight, and you see that the results of all the plants are approximately equal.  Why then does a competitive advantage fail?  Because it is leveled by problems in other parts of the business system. <br><br>  There is, for example, a software company that has developed its own unique framework.  She can create web-based business applications many times faster than competitors.  But at the same time, she has such a moronic system of sales and marketing that no one wants to work with this company.  Only a few get to the implementation, and sincerely surprised - can tasks really be solved so easily and quickly? <br><br>  Or there is a plant that has amazing sales, thanks to a well-established system of personal contacts.  Customers are ready to take everything clean, and even at prices higher than those of competitors.  It would seem - ship and rejoice.  But no.  The plant is so retarded supply that it can satisfy only 10 percent of the existing demand. <br><br>  I saw a factory that found several unique solutions for itself.  First, a niche is perfectly chosen - there is not a single competitor for a thousand kilometers.  Secondly, the production was awesomely organized, only new imported equipment, great specialists and excellent product quality.  But all the time he is stalling due to the fact that he does not know how to manage costs, often works in the negative and goes all the time in debt.  Elementary theft cannot win (produces consumer goods), at all levels. <br><br>  All advantages are leveled by disadvantages.  There is no such that everything was fine.  They set up one, were surprised by themselves, and sat down to rest on their laurels.  And in order to correct the shortcomings, we need ideas that are not. <br><br><h4>  Employee Ideas </h4><br>  So, I argue that the employees are full of good ideas, but the company knows nothing about them.  Why does not know - told above.  Doesn't want to know.  Where do employees get ideas from? <br><br>  The first and main source is previous jobs.  You have a bad supply?  Among your employees there are those who worked in the factory with a good supply.  Do you have a low time to market?  Among the employees there are those who have seen how products and releases can fly out, like hot, delicious cakes.  Testing problems?  Ask, for sure there are guys who can tell how effectively this process is organized. <br><br>  Moreover, it is not necessary to put a restriction like ‚Äúonly testers can know about testing‚Äù.  The observational coder, who saw testing from the outside, as input and output, will give even more useful information, because he used testing as a service and sees it as a consumer.  Testers could not even understand that they work very well, because they are not coders, they just do what they were told and how they were told. <br><br>  The second source, more relevant for our industry - read somewhere.  All of you read a lot, not only all the crap to make a laugh, but also useful articles.  Including - foreign authors.  You know how it happens - even a worthless article like this one can contain a grain of useful information that can be used. <br><br>  And how many of your employees are those who run their own business?  Let it be small, even falling apart, but were there any successes?  There were contacts with other enterprises, perhaps at the highest level, the same bird's-eye view of business partners. <br><br>  And, of course, education, in all its forms, is a great academic, even postgraduate study can be found, trainings, courses.  The company of this entity uses only what it knows to fulfill its current duties.  Everything else does not even ask, because  believes that there is nothing there. <br><br><h4>  Joining forces </h4><br>  And the company decided to ask the employees for the idea.  Let us suppose that somehow these thoughts turned out to be pulled out - they created a suitable atmosphere, or a process, or an automated system.  Then two manager dampers begin to work, killing these ideas.  Though, intentions can be good. <br><br>  The first is ‚Äúgive a complex offer‚Äù.  That is, do not just tell the user's story how you used the services of a cool supply, but give out all aspects.  How the process was organized inside, how the cross-functional communications worked, how the automated system worked, what are the features of the management system, what was the motivation of the employees. <br><br>  Alas, the employee does not know most of these details.  But he can find out - either by himself or with the help of other people.  Company visits to each other with the aim of sharing experience are not rare now, if there is no direct competition.  For example, at one factory I was engaged in supply automation a lot.  While the head of this department was sitting inside, it seemed to him that this was how it should be.  And when he left, he always asked to share his experience, because he, in general, did not remember a damn thing, and could not articulate what was good there.  Moreover, I could not answer the questions of my IT department, write the TK, ‚Äúgive a comprehensive offer‚Äù.  All that could answer - let's go and see.  Or "let's call their programmers, ask them to tell." <br><br>  The second damper is ‚Äútell me how to implement it.‚Äù  Organize the project, calculate the budget, put together a team, adapt the practice to our realities.  Implement, in short. <br><br>  Naturally, he will not be able to organize anything, especially if he is not a leader.  He will not even try, and the idea will disappear, and the manager will say - well, well, I did everything I could. <br><br>  Alas, not all.  I propose to combine efforts.  From the employee's idea, from the manager - implementation.  This is about introducing changes, and this is the direct responsibility of the manager. <br><br>  Naturally, it is not necessary to rush to travel in all enterprises where your employees once worked.  Primary selection of ideas, preliminary analysis and ranking are not canceled.  The main thing is that they do not turn into another damper, damping the impulse of development. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Let's just count.  For example, the company employs 200 people.  Of these, 1 is the owner, 1 is the director.  These two now give the most ideas for business development, because they are directly interested in success. <br><br>  There are still 10 top managers - deputy directors, or whatever they are called there.  They also give ideas, because they are forced by the owner and director.  They do it reluctantly, trying to give something simpler, because  Immediately think about the risks to yourself. <br><br>  And there are 188 people who have not expressed any ideas.  Maximum - ideas of the first level, "how to improve my work."  The same people, with arms, legs, head, who have seen no less than those 12. Those who read no less than books and articles, watched the same films and programs about leading enterprises, with which one well-known federal channel now likes to treat us. <br><br>  If you think that workers and a cleaner have no ideas, divide 188 in half, it will be 94. These are economists, financiers, personnel officers, salespeople, suppliers, designers, technologists, accountants, programmers, system administrators, engineers, middle managers, etc.  People of mental labor, in short. <br><br>  Further it is clear.  The company uses the ideas of 12 people - this is 11% of the total number of employees who are able to make sensible offers.  If you add the rest of the staff - and I recommend that you do - then 6% will remain.  Moreover, the quality of the ideas of these 12 people deliberately reduced by them.  Well, except for the owner and director. <br><br>  The ideas have the same funnel as in sales, marketing or RnD.  A thousand ideas come in, ten comes to implementation, i.e.  one%.  12 people will give twenty ideas, until the realization comes zero.  200 people will give two thousand ideas, and twenty will be realized. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The quantity and quality of ideas will grow iteratively, improving the ‚Äúpermeability‚Äù of the funnel. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I'll tell you about it next time.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452400/</a></p>
