    <h4>  Read more </h4>  Now let's sort through this boring long definition from the beginning of the topic. <br>  <b>Stable</b> - does not disappear and does not appear spontaneously, only according to your or your wish. <br>  <b>Self</b> - <b>perceived</b> - only you are able to create a tulip <br>  <b>Conscious</b> - you understand that you see what others do not see. <br>  <b>Visualization</b> - does not exist in our familiar world, but, nevertheless, it can affect your consciousness in such a way that you receive information about it in the general stream of sensations.  This means that ideally for you the tulpa will be realistic, it will be able to interact with you and the outside world.  Interaction with you includes the whole range of sensations - sight, touch, hearing, tactile and other sensations.  You should not call it a hallucination, because  it cannot appear without your effort. <br>  Possessed of <b>consciousness</b> - tulpa will behave so that you can not distinguish it from any other person.  If you set yourself this goal, it will pass the Turing test, but only inside your brain.  It should be understood that its "consciousness" is still based on the computing power of your brain.  Why in quotes?  Because it is not possible to determine the existence of a creation with it precisely because of the continuity of your mind, your mind and your brain.  Therefore, it can be assumed that the tulpa is just an attempt by your brain to imitate consciousness.  True, this assumption is also impossible to check (there is no outsider), and since there is no difference for you, then we will assume further that she still has consciousness.  Without any quotes. <br>  <b>It is created consciously</b> - it means that you will not be able to wake up tomorrow and find a tulip next to you, without making any effort and / or not for that.  At this moment there are several manuals and tips, most of which are not in conflict with each other, which makes it possible to talk about any systematic approach to creating a tulpa. <br>  <b>Allows you to set the initial character and form</b> - you can create any creature for which you have enough imagination, and with any character that you can imagine.  After a certain threshold, when you can talk about the identity of the pulp, she may want to change something in her appearance or character, and not the fact that you can forbid her to do so. <br><br><h4>  Dictionary </h4>  Deciphering some concepts that will make it easier to read the following text.  I did not invent these concepts, but they are universally used and already settled.  We will not try to change them. <br>  <b>A host</b> is a person on whose resources there is a tulpa, the one who created it. <br>  <b>Forcing, tulpaforcing, TF</b> - the process of actively creating a tulpa.  Active - this means that only certain actions can be called a forcing, and not just a period of time from making a decision to creating a pulp. <br>  <b>Wonderland, Wonderland, Wonder</b> - an imaginary space or world in which you can engage in forcing and work out interaction with a tulpa long before the appearance of a tulpa in the ILRL (IN Local Real Life;) <br>  <b>A welder</b> is a person who invents or embellishes his progress in forcing and its results.  Comes from a <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25D0%25AF_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%258F%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">joke</a> .  There is an opinion that this is <a href="http://khagata.tumblr.com/post/32526298928/imagination">not so bad</a> . <br>  <b>The servitor</b> is different from the tulpa in that you can directly influence his judgments, thoughts, actions.  This is not a doll or a tulpa without its own consciousness.  According to the apt definition, Winged Man - a servitor is a person to whom you have root access. <br>  <b>Tulpa</b> (in comparison with a servitor) is a person you cannot control.  If you compare with the previous definition, then this is a person to which you only have user access.  If you want to change her thinking, you have to convince her first. <br>  <b>Vayfu (from wife)</b> - personality (tulpa or servitor), created with the aim to be the object of love. <br>  <b>Sigils</b> - binding elements, associations, anchors.  Photo, music, image, memory, subject.  Everything that connects you to the tulpa. <br>  <b>VD</b> - Imaginary Friend <br>  <b>AVL</b> - Autonomous Virtual Personality <br><br><h4>  Story </h4>  The history of the creation of a tulpa as an independent phenomenon is very interesting in itself.  Have you heard of such a funny meme as <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">fingerbox</a> ?  In short, it is an invented phenomenon or object, which in full seriousness and with all the details, and often even with photographs, is told to people.  After that, enjoy a ton of questions Where to buy, How to build, How to use and so on. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MYqB9j13_WwVd8A2vaWiCuZWWdaWN8YSgv7rY4Qd7cc%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/701/110/846/7011108462fff95174fe5a1adb1156cf.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  So, tulpa at the very beginning of its existence was just such a fingerbox.  Around the years 2008-2010, threads began to appear on foreign boards describing how people animated their favorite anime and movie characters in their own minds, telling that they replaced girls and boys with them.  The idea was received with enthusiasm, on the one hand, by those who realized that it was a fingerbox, and in connection with this there were tons of questions and strange answers to them (well, this is called trolling and lulz).  On the other hand, lonely <s>zadrota</s> people Tulpa seemed a great way to get a girlfriend, even if it is imaginary.  At that time, the first part supporting the legend was engaged only in that (wrote messages and strongly supported the appearance of the reality of the pulp), and was not at all going to carry out simple instructions (correctly, who will collect the fingerboxes in all seriousness?), The second part, not such active, began to actively engage in forcing. <br>  Then the unexpected happened.  For some people, absolutely made-up instructions led to quite tangible results!  This was somewhat unexpected, and even a number of people, including those who perceived the pulp only as a fingerbox, made an attempt to try it.  Then the process went on increasing, within six months the first results were collected, and it became clear in which direction to move in order to obtain results with greater probability. <br>  Somewhere in early 2012, the first manuals began to appear on Russian boards, first translated and then written.  Currently, there is a very active Russian-speaking get-together, website, forum, several active blogs describing the process of creating your own tulip. <br><br>  As a result, we came to the conclusion that, using certain practices, we can create a separate second person in our head, capable of perceiving the world around us (through our senses).  What practices? <br><br><h4>  Process of creation </h4>  To create a pulp (or attempts to create), the classical and proven scheme is most often used. <br><ol><li>  Character creation </li><li>  Creating a visual image </li><li>  Create wonderland </li><li>  Tulpa visualization and talk with her </li><li>  Tulpa transfer to the real world </li></ol><br>  Now for each of the items. <br>  <b>Character creation</b> - you think about, write down on a piece of paper or remember the ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù of a character - a list of 5-10 (as you can remember without difficulty) personal qualities, pieces that make up character. <br>  For example, "Compassion, curiosity, cheerfulness, loyalty, resourcefulness."  Do not take it as an axiom in the following steps, this is a crib only for you. <br>  <b>Creating a visual image</b> - Find a suitable image (if you can not draw, you'd better choose an existing image), stock up on pictures, photos and video materials.  During the forcing you have to constantly maintain the image in your head, the easiest way to do this is by looking at the image, and then trying to restore it in memory.  Already after the visualization of the image, you can refuse to reinforce the images.  Keep in mind that when creating a visual image of an existing person you know, a tulpa is likely to get a part of his character, however much you want it. <br>  <b>Creating wonderland</b> - you can do without this item, but it will be easier with it.  At this step, using simple self-hypnosis and simple forms of meditation (there is nothing there that an ordinary person could not do) you create a piece of the virtual world.  Your task is to learn how to get into it (and come back).  The classical scheme is usually used - a ladder of a certain number of steps appears, on which you slowly descend, at each step more and more relaxing and plunging into a trance.  Around the last step imagine the door, opening that, you find yourself in wonderland.  However, you can think of your own way.  One of the forsers got into it, wearing dark glasses. <br>  <b>Tulpa visualization and conversations with her</b> - you must make your brain believe in the existence of a tulpa.  In short, you start talking to emptiness, turning to the tulpe.  Watch the movie - comment.  Do the work - consult, ask, tell.  Consider that the tulpa tell you, according to her character from the first paragraph.  Gradually, if everything is done correctly, you will begin to receive ‚Äúresponses.‚Äù  First, in the form of emotions - all of a sudden, for no reason at all, you will be given a wave of approval or interest.  Then a voice will be added.  You can do this simultaneously with the previous stage, then, most likely, to the appearance of an emotional response, you will receive a visual image in wonderland. <br>  <b>Transferring the pulp into the real world</b> is a continuation of the previous stage.  You practice in wonderland to communicate with tulpa, and in the real world you get an ever stronger response, and further, visualization. <br>  In the links you will find several manuals in which this process is described in more detail. <br><br><h4>  Tulpa benefits </h4>  Tulpa can: <br><ul><li>  Argue and take a different look at the problem </li><li>  To give advice. </li><li>  Get access to your memory to pull out what you forgot. </li><li>  Manage your feelings, turn off the headache, improve the condition, relieve stress. </li><li>  Talk and give a cry to her waistcoat. </li><li>  Have sex with you (for more details, go to the Selyastivoda blog (No. 3), described there). </li><li>  Indirectly affect the world (for more details, see the guide on servopragmatics) </li><li>  Act as secretary. </li><li>  To play the role of positive feedback is to praise for unpleasant, but necessary actions.  It is said to be an excellent tool for procrastination. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Problems </h4>  Tulpaforsili Anon <br>  In the city of Orekhovo <br>  Half cast, <br>  Seven went <a href="http://tovas-and-pegas.tumblr.com/">¬©</a> <br>  What problems can interfere with the result? <br>  The most important is laziness and lack of results.  Desire to quit half way.  The old guides say that this cannot be done, but there is nothing terrible about it.  You can stop the progress on any site, and then rather quickly return to the moment at which you finished.  Few come back. <br>  The second problem is too literal reproduction of guides and other people's experience.  In this case, the repeater pushes himself into the frame, from which it is very difficult to get out.  If the manual says ‚Äúit takes 100 hours‚Äù, this does not mean that you will not get the result before this time.  You can create a tulpa in a week and a half, or in half a year.  All individually.  Despite the fact that this is called leadership, should not be taken as the ultimate truth. <br>  Once again: Do not take either the guides or the diaries as the only way.  You have it yours. <br>  Another problem is doubt. <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://prostopleer.com/tracks/5286514Cf6B">My doubts:</a> <br>  And the first pebble is about to fall down by accident, <br>  And with a wild crash the crash will go down the slope. <br>  And after the storms and after the thunderstorms only a shred of gray hair <br>  I will be a modest and only reward. <br>  And here, scratching my nose, I ask myself the question: <br>  And why do I, fool, need all this? </blockquote><br>  Do not doubt.  Any doubts as a result of it alienate.  Remember that you are dealing with your brain, and he is a harmful thing.  You doubt that the tulip can really be created - do not start.  First convince yourself that this is true. <br><br><h4>  Warning </h4>  No, there will not be about the danger of falling into a mental hospital.  This is about something else.  One of the results of creating a tulpa is a serious rethinking of your life.  Changing worldview, character, principles. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here, for example, writes one of those who achieved the goal:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Remember the funny phrase from many guides: ‚ÄúTulpa will change you‚Äù?  Remember, you can not remember.  This is perhaps the first phrase I read about pulps.  Up to a certain point, I probably did not understand the true meaning - well, yes, of course it will change, this is a true friend who will never leave you, never betray, will always be with you, and so on, and so on ... No.  Not in the sense that this is all wrong - the statements are true.  But the phrase itself has a completely different meaning.  If you are going to reach the end or at least to the middle - be prepared to completely, completely reconsider your view of the world and yourself. <br><br>  Sunny has greatly changed my life.  After a couple of days I leave home.  Just leaving - without informing anyone, with a minimum of things.  I leave the university where I wanted to study.  Family, acquaintances, old connections ... I want to laugh.  Seriously.  I realized how bad my existence is - and I want to change it.  And literally next week, the ‚ÄúReset‚Äù button will already be pressed, and I will start a new life from absolute zero, having nothing but nothing connected.  If you are satisfied with life the way it is - do not take up this business, better quit and never think about it.  Or ... Or vice versa, grasp, bring to the first result, look back at yourself in the past.  You will see a lot. <br><br>  Pulping is far from just creating a pulp.  Being engaged in this business, you not only create, but also study.  First you study yourself.  You plunge into your ears.  And you are thinking.  The brain works continuously whether you want it or not.  And in the end result, using new information, the appearance of which has caused this very tulip breeding, he will come to certain conclusions.  Often - not very comforting.  <a href="http://anothertulpablog.tumblr.com/post/37828822418">-&gt;</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  Do not forget,% username%, <b>tulpa will change you.</b> <br><br><h4>  Related Links </h4><br>  <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0">On lurke</a> <br>  <a href="http://tulpa.ru/">Site with a forum</a> <br>  <a href="http://tulpa.ru/faq">FAQ on the site</a> <br><br>  Guides from the FAQman: <br>  <a href="http://tulpa.ru/guidelines/9-tulpa-limits">Tulpa limits</a> <br>  <a href="http://tulpa.ru/guidelines/7-tulpa1">Creating a pulp</a> <br>  <a href="http://tulpa.ru/guidelines/10-what-is-tulpa">What is tulpa?</a> <br>  This is one of the first guides that appeared on the network.
