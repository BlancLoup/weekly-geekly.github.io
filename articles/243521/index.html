  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Innovations in ecommerce that can change online shopping</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Some new items take their place in our lives unnoticed.  But when the matter of life is somehow connected with IT - it is important to see the trends in time and use them to advantage. <br>  Today we will discuss the innovations of the ecommerce industry, which, perhaps in a couple of years, will change our idea of ‚Äã‚Äãonline shopping, and you can try out some of them in your business today. <br><br>  <b>Shopping through social media</b> <br>  Amazon, one of the world leaders in e-commerce, has been gathering crowds of loyal and paying customers around itself for several years.  In early May 2014, the company introduced <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/socialmedia/amazoncart/">AmazonCart</a> to customers to add products to their shopping cart directly from Twitter.  To make it work, you need to link your Amazon and Twitter accounts.  After that, you can add to your cart or wishlist your favorite product from Amazon tweets simply by replying to the message with the hashtag #AmazonCart or #AmazonWishList.  When you next enter the site, the product will already be in the basket (wish list) and the user no longer needs to wander around the site for hours in search of what once caught his eye on Twitter. <br>  It turned out to be so convenient that in the first two weeks of the service, they were used 157,000 times. <br>  Vogue, the most famous fashion magazine uses instragrams to help readers find where to buy their favorite thing (there are tags for a designer or a store near things). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a9/195/c8f/5a9195c8f4e44b93bc4c383eadff2515.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many, even medium-sized online stores for cm-sales use a special service <a href="http://new.soldsie.com/">Soldsie</a> , which allows you to send an invoice to the email to the buyer, after he wrote the comment ‚Äúsold‚Äú under the desired product.  In the letter come the details of the order and details for payment by card or via PayPal.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/590/24f/1ef/59024f1effbc46598910a8956bf2cc82.jpg"><br>  <i>Selling jewelry through the Prep Obsessed store's facebook page</i> <br><br>  Meanwhile, Twitter in their blog announced that in the near future, some American brands will be able to sell their products by embedding the ‚Äúbuy‚Äù button directly into a tweet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb0/9b0/d38/eb09b0d38fed476a824153974c942814.jpg"><br><br>  The initial list of partner brands, including Burberry (@ <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user%3Fscreen_name%3Dburberry">burberry</a> ), Eminem (@ eminem), Panic!  At The Disco (@ <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user%3Fscreen_name%3Dpanicatthedisco">panicatthedisco</a> ). <br><br>  <b>Electronic payment systems, wallets and virtual currency</b> <br>  Do not you think that typing every time you buy 16 digits from a card is a bit tedious?  Especially from the small screen of the smartphone.  That is why, with the flourishing of mobile ecommerce, a lot of mobile wallets and alternative payment methods appeared on the market and over time, they will only gain popularity, which should be taken into account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/381/338/2c4/3813382c4706497f99e7bf90c070b400.jpg"><br>  <i>walletone is one of many mobile wallets on the market</i> <br><br>  On September 9, Apple introduced their ApplePay payment service.  The user only needs to enter his card details once using the camera or manually, and you can make purchases simply by choosing ApplePay among the suggested payment methods (in addition to offline purchases using NFC).  So far this only works in iTunes for owners of sixth iPhones, but since the API is open to developers, the market expects a number of interesting innovations that will affect the market. <br>  Already, ApplePay is compatible with the readers of Visa PayWave, MasterCard PayPass, American Express Express, and hundreds of banks and major retailers have said that they support this system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e5/d1f/239/8e5d1f2391a34abdbabf5cc533e71112.jpg"><br><br>  Using the same technology, GoogleWallet, launched in 2011, is a payment system developed by Google and released for users of Android devices.  In addition, it is possible to order a regular debit card and pay it in stores. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4d/f07/582/c4df07582aec48c2aead392eab047dd4.jpg"><br>  <i>This is the GoogleWallet Card.</i>  <i>Image taken from techcrunch.com</i> <br><br>  On the one hand, there are lots of advantages in electronic wallets and payment systems.  On the other hand, if a user is concerned about security (and we are all worried about the security of your credit cards), then a purchase using GoogleWallet may look like this: you get the phone, unlock the screen and enter the password (use a smartphone that contains personal information, access to mail , social networks and applications, without additional restriction of access - it is unreasonable, because we password it in advance), click on the Wallet icon, which can also be password-protected and for good reason (no one can pay without your PIN code, but you cannot find out all the details  whether your transactions - easily), enter the password, wait until it is loaded and, finally, enter the PIN code.  At any moment of this process, well, we are realists, the application may, for example, fall due to a lack of RAM.  Imagine the chagrin of a man who tried to just buy a cup of coffee. <br>  Meanwhile, around the world, Bitcoins continue to gain popularity, now they can be removed at special ATMs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aee/4e7/e03/aee4e7e03297435ba6970cdcb36a608c.jpg"><br>  <i>bitcoin ATM card</i> <br><br>  <b>Delivery to the store</b> <br>  Logistics costs are one of the most difficult things for online store owners.  According to surveys, up to <a href="http://www.redhotpenny.com/blog/should-your-ecommerce-website-offer-free-shipping">82% of buyers will</a> prefer a site with free shipping.  And <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/17/almost-half-of-all-online-orders-now-include-free-shipping/">about 61% would</a> prefer to cancel the purchase if the delivery is paid. <br>  A good alternative is to eliminate delivery altogether.  A person makes a purchase on the site, and takes it to the nearest store, without waiting and queues.  A convenient option for well-developed retail chains like walmart.com and bestbuy.com, and for small stores.  For example, the stock <a href="http://www.red.ua/">Red</a> clothing store uses such delivery for customers in Kiev.  This is convenient for buying clothes that can be measured and replaced right in the store, if not approached, while avoiding hours of searching all the shelves in search of specific things, all this work is done for the buyer by filters in the online store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a0/8be/2bb/6a08be2bb2c44d6ab227cc4a0c7c7945.jpg"><br><br>  First, they invented and introduced such a service at the <a href="http://qz.com/132309/macys-boosted-sales-by-making-stores-distribution-centers-for-exclusive-items/">Nordstrom</a> store in 2008, with the help of which store sales grew by 8% and revenue by 42% over 4 years. <br><br>  <b>Content-oriented online shopping</b> <br>  Most sellers and store owners display their product on the site as well, as they would show it in the offline store.  The trouble is that the user on the Internet behaves completely differently from coming to the store and viewing products on the shelves. <br>  On the one hand, in a regular store, a person cannot see a product overview or teleport from one sales point to another, in order to compare offers, it is easy, pleasant and pleasant to switch between tabs with e-shops. <br>  Some ecommerce sites caught this difference, for example, popular Net-a-porter and Joyus stores present their products more interactively, rather than simply pouring tons of names, prices and specifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/332/133/d18/332133d188d0466a87d4416f5b462d6c.jpg"><br><br>  These stores have taken the original, magazine-style demonstration as a basis, they offer a video where you can see how a thing sits when moving, whether it stretches, what a fabric looks like at a different light.  In addition, in the same place you can see the stylists' advice on the accessories that fit the thing and how you can wear it for different situations and situations. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cb/140/6c5/4cb1406c5ed34ffd8f2c951dae9c9f71.jpg"><br><br>  Such a presentation is more like acquaintance with a product than just a warehouse price list, as it was several years ago.  Of course, first of all, this approach is valuable for sellers of cosmetics, clothes, accessories and beautiful gizmos for the interior.  But knowing how important it is for a person to ‚Äúsee‚Äù his purchase and its place in his life, sellers of absolutely any product can benefit. <br><br>  <b>Work with big data</b> <br>  At the moment, buyers and businesses generate a huge amount of data that companies are already trying to collect, organize and use.  So far, not everyone succeeds in this, but with a wealth of data for analytics, in the coming years, companies will be able to focus on tasks and problems, which, in turn, will change the scale of the decisions made during work and customer service. <br>  Instead of drawing up comprehensive instructions for creating a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù result, there will be more opportunity for micro solutions for all aspects of the business.  For example, ‚Äúhow to reduce the time of delivery to the city of N‚Äú, ‚Äúhow to return buyers of food for large dogs that have become inactive in recent months and why they have lost their loyalty.‚Äù <br>  Companies will try to do not ‚Äúcool for everyone,‚Äù but ‚Äúcool for everyone.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c17/e5c/6ba/c17e5c6ba130415ca320cce568395c08.jpg"><br>  <i>Amazon sends personalized emails with products similar to those that the recipient has already bought or added to the wish list.</i>  <i>Also in such letters get accessories to the already purchased goods.</i>  <i>The image is taken from the website <a href="http://conversionxl.com/">conversionxl.com</a></i> <br><br>  E-commerce is fertile ground for experimentation and innovation.  The flexibility of the sphere and the ability to quickly introduce any new product allows you to test any ideas and strategies.  In case of success, the bonus will be a serious push to business and new ways to generate income.  Of course, there may be failures, in order to experience them with minimal losses, you should approach the experiments from the point of view of common sense and evaluate their results in time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243521/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243521/</a></p>
