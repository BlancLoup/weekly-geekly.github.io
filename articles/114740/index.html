  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Manual control</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The last wristwatch I had class, it seems, in the tenth.  I remember well my ‚ÄúRay‚Äù on a leather strap - such was the gadget.  But it was already the first half of the zero, and the clock, as a tool for determining time, turned into an anachronism - time could be looked at on a mobile phone, computer, and even a microwave.  It is time that is the most important informational trend of our time, judging by the number of options how it can be recognized. <br><br>  Another trend - the miniaturization of phones (remember the joke about the only thing men measure against, who have less? Only a couple of years ago it was still relevant) - suddenly changed in the direction of growing screen diagonals and, accordingly, dimensions.  Mobile phones are again not so mobile. <br><br>  Like curves on a plane, trends sometimes intersect.  And at the intersections amazing things are born.  Sony Ericsson LiveView - of these.  As the manufacturer describes the concept of the gadget, Sony Ericsson LiveView "is part of the portfolio of Sony Ericsson Extras - a line of accessories that extend the capabilities of mobile phones."

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/29fc1612/af15adee/8fd2a951/66b93bbd.jpg"><br><br>  This is an auxiliary device that combines the functions of an informer, a remote control, an alarm and a clock, which becomes absolutely indispensable when you get used to it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Packing and packaging </h4><br>  LiveView is fixed inside the diamond box right on the clip, which is one of the chips of its form factor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1c8e8470/e890ac5b/937d5312/fad9dd2c.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the box there is also a strap for a hand, a frame and two pins carefully packed in a bag, on which the strap is attached to the frame: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ab2711ba/91e9d6e5/56ca7f18/10739503.jpg"><br><br>  Also included are a power supply with microUSB-connector and user manual, the most familiar language in which was English. <br><br>  This box will cost approximately 3000-3500 re when it becomes available at the end of March. <br><br><h4>  Appearance and dimensions </h4><br>  Square, with sides of 35x35 mm and with a 1.3 ‚Äùscreen, the LiveView on your hand looks more like a simple digital clock.  And in principle, it can be used exactly in this capacity - at least, I used it most often when I had to look at the time, and it was inconvenient to go into my pocket.  A long-forgotten elegant gesture - raising a hand to your eyes, move the shirt cuff with one finger and look at the time. <br><br>  The device is quite thin - 11 mm, but because of its small size it looks plump.  Two control keys are located at the top of the corners: on the left is the on / off key combined with the LED, on the right is the double-sided selection key, on the bottom is the micro USB port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4432d327/1fb72c90/e80f3a3f/9395af9e.jpg"><br><br>  There is a wide black frame around the screen.  This is not a fad of developers, but an urgent need: the fields around the LiveView display are a control ‚Äî they are all four pressed to allow navigation through a simple menu. <br><br>  By default, the display is turned off, so as not to waste energy.  It is activated by pressing any button and by default shows the time and date.  The resolution of 128x128 makes it possible, for example, to read SMS.  Just write the answer from LiveView itself will not work :) <br><br><h4>  Beginning of work </h4><br>  First of all, you need to update the software to the latest.  I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/109438/">once wrote</a> that the software update is organized so clearly that it is almost impossible to make a mistake.  Not to be unfounded, I will demonstrate this clearly. <br><br>  After starting <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/support/accessories/download/updateserviceextras/liveviewmicrodisplay%3Fcc%3Dru%26lc%3Dru">the Update Service program,</a> you need to do just six steps: <br><br>  Select device (LiveView): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0ee1b94d/64ceb6b0/ea5b83d5/042f52b6.png"><br><br>  Press the button: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/06976b6b/03581140/0fdf02db/a5590689.png"><br><br>  Release the button <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/07e17523/6f6141f9/af06dee1/64683576.png"><br><br>  Ensure fresh firmware is available. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c03784e9/e7e393c3/94182f13/c6f758fd.png"><br><br>  Wait for the installation to complete <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5e98c6bf/15cb80d5/0047d28e/8caa53c0.png"><br><br>  And disconnect the device from the computer <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/329dd7cf/06d6558b/7a9a8cd0/7a028b85.png"><br><br>  The next step is to install the free LiveView application from the Android Market on your phone.  Or you can simply read the barcode directly from the screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ad965105/30f085cb/240079ac/5348720e.png"><br><br>  <i>By the way, LiveView is not only compatible with Sony Ericsson phones.</i>  <i>The site has a complete and constantly updated <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/accessories/compatiblephonesotherbrands/liveviewmicrodisplay%3Fcc%3Dru%26lc%3Dru">list of compatible devices</a> , currently it is Samsung Galaxy S, Nexus One 2.2, HTC Desire, HTC Desire Z, HTC Wildfire 2.1, Motorola Milestone 2.0.1 and Motorola Milestone XT720.</i> <br><br>  Then you need to install the <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sonyericsson.extras.liveware%26feature%3Dsearch_result">LiveView</a> application of the same name - without it, the phone can find the device, but you cannot pair it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/cd72a915/a47e4ea0/b3142dd7/dbdc09d3.jpg"><br><br>  With it, LiveView instantly becomes a full-fledged extension of your tube. <br><br><h4>  Functional </h4><br>  So what does LiveView do? <br><ul><li>  Monitor incoming and missed calls </li><li>  Notify receipt and show SMS </li><li>  Remind events in the calendar </li><li>  Manage media player </li><li>  Search phone </li><li>  Notify about updates in facebook, twitter and rss feeds </li></ul><br>  The latter functions, by the way, develop the concept of a single activity tape, which Sony Ericsson is developing in the Timescape application - even without reaching the phone, you can find out in the general stream what was tweeted between the last call and the received SMS. <br><br>  Management through the LiveView application includes the ability to disconnect the device, turn on / off the vibrating signal, mark all notifications as read and, of course, choose which activities ‚Äî whether incoming calls, text messages or tweets ‚Äî should be notified: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/625616df/365c5913/0643e874/46c2fc99.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Using </h4><br>  The LiveView package includes two options for wearing it - wrist, on a strap, or using a clip.  With the first, everything is clear - in the end, it can also show time.  From a distance on the arm, it resembles the unpretentious Casio watches of my school time.  Eh, childhood, childhood ... <br><br>  To replace the clip on the strap, it is necessary to otkovyrnut nail clip frame and replace it with a strap mount.  Then you need to put the strap of the sleeve into the loops and insert them into the lugs.  The work of this jewelry - I fiddled about three minutes before drove all the balls in the pockets.  But the strap can be changed - at least for crocodile skin.  This is in case, for example, its material made of cloth seems to someone not enough glamorous. <br><br>  The option with a clip allows you to wear a LiveView, for example, on a bag strap, on a belt or fasten it to your pocket: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c1d1ba77/1ac98c54/b7b6c0f4/1b4d10b1.jpg"><br><br>  Or attach to something at the table to look while you work: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d57462e2/d7b19732/97a72f7c/3cd006ad.jpg"><br><br>  Or so: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/db6d4e1a/d7e1fd88/0e1cf4d1/6b214668.jpg"><br><br>  Who is more comfortable, but for me - the format of wrist wearing is beyond competition: you get used to the LiveView on your hand instantly, and after a while you stop noticing it.  He only reminds himself of a modest buzz when, for example, there is an incoming call.  It is really convenient - on the first day I managed to pick up the phone after I left the phone in my jacket, and another time when I forgot it in another room.  Actually it is for girls who never hear the phone buried in the bag. <br><br>  But a missed call or SMS is non-lethal - if you are not an ambulance operator: you can call back.  The real killer features, in my opinion, are the search function of the phone - if the handset is lost, LiveView will make it give a voice - of course, within the bluetooth signal (up to 10 if without thick walls), and the player‚Äôs remote control. <br><br>  A long press of the select button (on the right) opens a concise music management interface: pressing the left-right edges of the screen switches the tracks, the top and bottom adjust the volume, press the select button once - pause, long-time - return to the main menu.  This is more convenient, perhaps, than the remote control on the headset itself - especially when it is hidden under thick winter clothes. <br><br>  The battery holds up to 4 days - that is, exactly longer than any smartphone on the android - and it charges in just two hours.  At the end of charging, the red light changes to green.  And to remove the strap from your hands for charging is not at all necessary - it is enough to unfasten the LiveView itself. <br><br><h4>  Sundries </h4><br>  LiveView functionality can be significantly expanded due to the possibility of interaction with third-party plug-ins.  To find them, there is a special application - <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sonyericsson.extras.liveview%26feature%3Dsearch_result">LiveWare</a> Manager. <br><br>  I decided to experiment with two programs: <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.daylightmap.moon.pro.android">Moon Phase Pro</a> and <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dnet.homeip.intellego.liveview.contactcall">Live View Contact Call</a> . <br><br>  Moon Phase Pro turned out to be a full-fledged paid application for Android ($ 0.99 ~ 29 rubles), which can also be run from LiveView - although the wow effect of being able to find out the dates of the next full moon seemed rather doubtful to me, but for everything else, it‚Äôs better run from the phone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/43da1592/5e80cbe4/0fc5bad3/8f140090.jpg"><br><br>  The free LiveView ContactCall plugin is another matter, it allows LiveView to enter phone contacts and make calls, which brings the capabilities of the device to a new, quite adult level.  And there is in fact another <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Duk.co.lilhermit.android.liveview.gmail">Gmail</a> mailbox plugin for <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Duk.co.lilhermit.android.liveview.gmail">LiveView</a> , LiveWare is also compatible with the application for lovers of healthy lifestyle and jogging in the morning <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.awwa">Smart Training</a> , and also, according to <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/sonyericsson/73954.html">colleagues from LiveJournal</a> , in the Android Market there are already two dozen compatible with LiveView applications and plugins for it, the list of which is constantly updated. <br><br><h4>  Everything new is well forgotten old </h4><br>  Sony Ericsson LiveView can be placed in the encyclopedia as an illustration to the saying "you quickly get used to the good."  This is a clean, distilled case of a marketing solution - a device, the need for which is not immediately obvious, but having tried it out, I don‚Äôt want to let go of it.  The nominee for the ‚ÄúMost Useful Device‚Äù award at CES in 2011. <br><br>  <i>Speaking of awards.</i>  <i>‚ÄúDuring the Telecom Xperience exhibition in November 2010 in Utrecht, the Netherlands, the Sony Ericsson LiveView won two awards -‚Äú The Most Innovative Accessory ‚Äùand‚Äú Best Overall Impression ‚Äù,‚Äù the <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/accessories/overview/liveviewmicrodisplay%3Fcc%3Dru%26lc%3Dru">Sony Ericsson website</a> tells us.</i> <br><br>  Who knows, perhaps, when technological progress finally reaches the broadcast of the image directly to the retina, healthy ‚Äúshovels‚Äù of smartphones, so consisting of practically one display, are no longer necessary - and only such compact wrist control panels will be in demand.  He would have to add a manual plant, for complete autonomy - and here he is, the perfect gadget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5a46df59/0680d7b9/c122304c/e3179631.jpg"><br><br>  <b>See you again;)</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114740/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114740/</a></p>
