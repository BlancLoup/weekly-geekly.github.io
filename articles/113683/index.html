  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 reasons to buy a tablet and another 5 while not doing this</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/69a/963/316/69a9633161f347c5c13d70c2c93f2aeb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Tablet computers have quickly become popular devices, and more and more owners of these gadgets are in the world.  But many of you probably spend time waiting, watching when that same tablet appears that is right for you.  But try to ask yourself another question.  Instead of ‚ÄúWhich tablet should I buy?‚Äù Ask ‚ÄúWhy do I need a tablet?‚Äù. <br><br>  New items on the tablet market appear with enviable regularity.  Already, on sale there are several models that are actively purchased.  Some more interesting tablet computers will appear in the coming months.  So let's think together what reasons may prompt you to buy a fashionable gadget.  And then a few reasons not to part with the money. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. The tablet is convenient as an e-reader. <br>  Although many complained that reading from the tablet screen did not compare with reading from a specialized device with an electronic ink-based screen, and the text on them was not so clear, all these shortcomings did not stop people from reading e-books, PDF, comics of long articles from the web, including on tablets.  In addition, for example, children's books are good in color than the same Kindle can not yet boast. <br><br>  2. Tablets are personal productivity stations. <br>  Schedule, distribute cases and plans, work with e-mail on the big screen of the tablet is very convenient.  And although many of our phones can at the very least serve as personal assistants, tablets provide the real comfort in this area.

      3. Tablets are better than old laptops <br>  This statement is true if you do not need to type a lot of text.  Tablets allow you to operate with more content than old laptops, and you can use the most modern applications and games. <br><br>  4. Tablets are great for meetings. <br>  Of course, do not forget that with a tablet in hand, you will attract much more attention from the rest of the meeting.  But it is very convenient to take notes on it, and in especially boring cases, you can unobtrusively run your favorite Angry Birds without sound. <br><br>  5. Using tablets it is convenient to show photos <br>  Show photos, having a tablet, very easy and convenient.  It can be a good help in the work of insurance agents, insurers and sellers who have to hold presentations for a small audience.  Having everything in front of you in a small, cute device is much more convenient than traditional presentations using a laptop. <br><br>  6. Tablets are great for movies and music. <br>  There is nothing better than giving a child with a fancy car a tablet with your favorite cartoons.  The tablet will cost no more than installing a monitor and a DVD in the headrest of a car seat.  In addition, you can grab your tablet in the plane and enjoy movies during the boring flight. <br><br>  7. The tablet is cheaper than the new laptop <br>  Your old big laptop ordered to live long?  Instead of buying a new note on the tablets.  Often they are even more powerful than modern laptops, costing about $ 500. <br><br>  8. Tablets better fall <br>  Often, the maximum that you may need after they fall is a quick reboot. <br><br>  9. The tablet can be useful when traveling. <br>  Support for Wi-Fi and 3G, large screen and bulk storage are perfect for maps, guides and dictionaries. <br><br>  10. Tablets are cool by themselves. <br>  They make others feel like you are from the future.  And this is great.  :-) <br><br>  And now the promised 5 reasons why it is not yet necessary to buy a tablet. <br><br>  1. The tablet is not as portable as your phone that you already have.  You used to keep it in your pocket.  But try doing the same with the iPad, for example.  Everywhere you have to carry an extra bag or bag for your favorite gadget.  And it is certainly not portable any modern smartphone. <br><br>  2. Games on the tablets is not enough.  I mean it is real games, not small time killers like, for example, Angry Birds, with all due respect to birds.  You will not be able to play Battlefield with a couple of dozen people around the world.  You can not spend hundreds of hours of life in World of Warcraft.  You will not find any second part of Crysis on the tablet.  Tablets are too weak for modern games, in comparison with the PC, and most likely they will remain so. <br><br>  3. The range of work that you can do on the tablet is extremely small.  These are mostly simple office tasks.  You can't run Photoshop on it.  A video rendering will take hours on the tablet. <br><br>  4. It is convenient to visit the web page from the tablet, watching TV on the couch.  And the films on it look very cool.  But in fairness it should be noted that you could sit on the Internet on the sofa before, using a time-tested laptop.  Why do you need another device for the same purpose?  Well, films are much more pleasant to watch with greater resolution and powerful sound on the big screen than on a train or bent over in bed. <br><br>  5. In a couple of months, something better will appear.  Remember the fashion for netbooks?  They were called the future of computers.  Now their place was taken by tablets.  In a few years, we will write an article ‚ÄúRemember the tablets?‚Äù, Complaining that we spent a lot of money on this stupid transitional device. <br><br>  via <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/12/10-reasons-to-buy-a-tablet-and-5-reasons-not-to/">TechCrunch</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113683/</a></p>
