      2008 was the worst year for Elon Musk.  This year there was a third consecutive failure to launch a rocket built by his company SpaceX.  The funding of Tesla Motors, an electric vehicle manufacturer, has failed.  Another of his projects, SolarCity, a supplier in the field of solar energy, also experienced financial difficulties.  In addition, this year Elon's reputation suffered from a high-profile divorce process. <br><br>  Elon founded SpaceX and SolarCity in 2002-2003, and in 2008 the American economy was in deep recession.  The $ 180 million he received from the sale of Pay Pal in 2002 (eBay Corporation) was spent on SpaceX ($ 100M), Tesla ($ 70M) and Solar City ($ 10M). <br><br>  But today Elon is back on the horse.  In September 2008, the fourth launch of the SpaceX rocket took place, which successfully launched the satellite into orbit.  The successful fifth launch of the rocket in 2010 and the landing of the Dragon descent vehicle, and then the successful docking of the next Dragon apparatus with the orbital station and the delivery of cargo to astronauts, led NASA to sign a contract with SpaceX for 440 million.  Added to this are contracts for hundreds of millions of dollars with companies and governments of several countries. <br><br>  Tesla recently introduced the Model S sedan - its first mass-produced car.  In the two years since the IPO, its shares have risen by 70%. <br><br>  Solar City, among whose investors Google, plans to build solar energy facilities worth $ 1 billion over five years. <br><br>  Elon Mask (41 years old) is said to have transformed three branches.  He is not only a visionary and a financier, he is a technologist, and moves technology forward. <br><br>  Mask was born and grew up in Pretoria, South Africa in the family of a writer and engineer.  He bought his first computer when he was 10 years old, and at the age of 12 he developed and sold a computer game for $ 500. <br><br>  After school, Musk studied in Canada and the United States.  He left graduate school at Stanford in 1995, he founded zip2 - a software developer for media companies.  Compaq bought it for 341 million in 1999. <br><br>  In 2000, Pay Pal was formed, in which Musk was one of the co-founders.  When he was sold, inspiration came to the mask.  America, he believed, had lost the will to explore space.  His dream was to send a greenhouse with plants to Mars in order to later photograph the living plants against the red planet and transfer pictures of ‚Äúlife on Mars‚Äù to Earth. <br><br>  Before starting to design his own missiles, Musk flew to Russia three times, trying to convince the government to sell him one of the dismantled liquid ballistic missiles.  ‚ÄúIt was a strange experiment, and it led nowhere,‚Äù he says.  Then in 2002 it was decided to build its own spaceX rocket. <br><br>  The decision to build an electric car also led a sad story of the failure of EV1 General Motors.  It was the first attempt by a large corporation to build an electric car, and it ended so badly that General Motors destroyed all the tangible assets left after the project was closed. <br><br>  Tesla Motors was founded in 2003, and in 2008 released the first all-electric sports roadster. <br><br>  Mask demanding perfectionist and pedant in the technical field.  His education in the field of physics helps to see objective truths and to separate them from emotional evaluations and speculative forecasts.  He just thinks big.  For example, he thinks about the means of public transport called ‚Äúhyper-loop‚Äù.  This electric supersonic device should deliver people from Los Angeles to San Francisco (350 miles) in 30 minutes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152187/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152187/</a></p>
