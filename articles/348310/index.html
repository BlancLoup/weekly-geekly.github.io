I invite you to discuss the effectiveness of search tools, attraction and immersion in the projects of those who are just beginning their careers in the field of information technology. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mn/rg/re/mnrgreaj1b3uv-r6_edqdiw2h6c.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  It is better to space! </h2><br>  Recently, I came across a humorous sticker ‚ÄúPeople fly into space, but you can't find a candidate!‚Äù, And I thought about the fact that the task of finding a star that meets complex business criteria and for earthly money would actually be more difficult than launching a rocket to space. <br><br>  In an ideal world back in the year 2149, we will be able to gain knowledge by simply inserting chips with certain programs directly into the skull box.  But the problem is that this time is still very far away, and the IT market is already so ‚Äúdehydrated‚Äù that even getting a good ready-made specialist becomes a task from the category of science fiction.

      No, I tell you, it's better into space!  (Yes, we already have a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/lanit/blog/337770/">space center</a> built.) I think that even the newly created HR-bot Vera also cannot solve this problem. <br><br>  And here we are ‚Äústar wars‚Äù, trying to lure the best shots into its orbit.  We are ready to fight, we are the best in our field, but the battlefield is getting smaller, and the price is getting higher each time, even for those specialists who have to be retrained or retrained to fulfill our design tasks.  This reduces the margins of the business and cannot continue indefinitely. <br><br><h2>  Without a special program can not do </h2><br>  In LANIT long ago stated that the Jedi must be prepared from the youth.  Units always conducted work on attracting young specialists, but each had his own approach, there was no uniform policy and they coped with this task to the best of their abilities and capabilities. <br><br>  In order to systematize the efforts and increase the flow of young specialists to the company, HR-service launched the internal program ‚ÄúVitamin Growth‚Äù. <br><br>  The huge gap between university educational programs and the needs of real projects is a problem for almost all companies in Russia.  Business is interested in recruiting specialists who are as ready as possible to participate in projects, but even the best graduates should be trained in specialty work.  Immersion of young specialists in projects requires significant costs for their preparation and the diversion of resources from project implementation, therefore the main focus of our program is on the support of units engaged in the recruitment of interns. <br><br>  The structure of the program "Vitamin Growth" includes: <br><br><ul><li>  investments of the administration, due to compensations to the FOT departments of young specialists and any activities to attract them, </li><li>  assistance to departments in organizing and conducting internships, </li><li>  increasing company awareness among young professionals </li><li>  work with universities, </li><li>  support of educational programs in universities and educational sites in our territory. </li></ul><br><h2>  How things are arranged </h2><br>  In 2017, we successfully conducted more than 20 internship programs for departments. <br>  In preparation for each of them, the objectives, the format, the trainee profiles, the stages and the criteria for their selection were determined together with the units.  We targeted our programs, telephoned the candidates and invited them to a day event on our territory.  Within its framework, students received detailed information about the departments and passed screening tests.  Then successful were invited to face-to-face interviews with the service staff and heads of departments, and then - for an internship. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wm/r9/pj/wmr9pjf5ywmdxzpyrqjhjj_nsva.jpeg"></div><br>  The divisions, taking into account their specifics and needs, chose different internship options.  For example, the Department of Health and Medicine Solutions for LANIT for Analysts, <a href="http://www.in-systems.ru/">INSISTEMS</a> for Design Engineers and the Department for Corporate Systems of LANIT for Testers chose a scenario with immersion in existing projects.  The selected trainees were immediately assigned to mentors, from whom, over time, they obtained more and more complex practical tasks, thereby being drawn into the work of the unit. <br><br>  In <a href="http://itlanit.ru/">‚ÄúLANIT-Integration‚Äù</a> in 2017, interns underwent a monthly training course for engineers in the main areas of infrastructure, after which they were distributed to departments for work on existing projects.  The knowledge gained on the course helped them quickly adapt to the needs of the projects and receive good feedback on their work. <br><br>  "LANIT - BPM" regularly conducts internship programs with training for developers and analysts.  The guys get acquainted with the Pega BPM product in detail (we <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/lanit/blog/342962/">recently wrote about it in our blog</a> ), with the technologies and developer tools, interact with mentors and carry out practical test tasks.  At the internship introduced a point system, the best interns are accepted in the state. <br><br>  This year, the Department of Computer Aided Design Systems LANIT conducted an educational practice for students of the Moscow State Technical University.  Bauman with practical case studies. <br>  Other subdivisions involved young specialists in the work, carrying out individual recruitment for staff with the subsequent development. <br><br>  And whatever the format, the program ‚ÄúVITAMIN ROSTA‚Äù is distinguished by the fact that it really gives an opportunity here and now to gain invaluable practical experience in complex projects of leading foreign and Russian companies in one team with the best of the best specialists in the IT industry. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6p/np/6e/6pnp6e4icyptifai57ba5z5wnkg.jpeg"></div><br><h2>  Opinions of business representatives </h2><br>  The interest in internships confirms the correctness of the chosen path in working with departments and in order to evaluate the effects and benefits they receive, I spoke with their representatives: <b>Vsevolod Grigoriev</b> from the Department of Computer Aided Design LANIT, <b>Alexey Panteleev</b> from <a href="http://itlanit.ru/">LANIT-Integration</a> and <b>Ekaterina Zubkova</b> from ‚Äú LANIT - BPM ". <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Why do you work with young professionals?</b> <br>  <b>Alexey:</b> On the one hand, this is an opportunity to find and grow "stars for yourself".  On the other hand, to contribute ‚Äúto the development of the country‚Äù: to have a hand in the training of young specialists and in preparing them for the choice of profession. <br>  <b>Vsevolod:</b> We see that in the field of education there is a positive tendency towards learning through practice (practical study of the subject) and we try to support this in every way.  During practice or training in training centers, it is much easier to interest future specialists and show that the theory works in life.  From the point of view of our direction (CAD), not all graduates without a practical basis can understand at the exit where to go (in what direction) it is better to go to work, and most often they are not organized by profession.  Thus, we lose, perhaps, valuable employees of our industry. <br>  <b>Catherine:</b> For young professionals - the future, they are more flexible, fast and ambitious.  We work with innovative technologies, and innovation - for young people. <br><br>  <b>Is working with young professionals profitable for business?</b> <br>  <b>Alexey:</b> We have many real examples of the validity of using young professionals.  We often involve them in the implementation of projects, while taking them at a part-time, sometimes part-time, given the flexible schedule.  Recently there was a project where six intern interns under the guidance of a mentor were involved in solving one of the combat missions.  It is worth noting the benefit from participation in the program "Vitamin Growth" - due to it we receive compensation for part of the cost of their labor.  We also develop loyal employees who grow and gain experience in our company. <br>  <b>Vsevolod:</b> The value, from the point of view of the business itself, is obvious.  Every day it is becoming more and more difficult to find a suitable ready candidate for a position where high subject knowledge is required.  It is much easier to grow a "diamond". <br>  <b>Catherine:</b> To work with young specialists, it is necessary to develop a training course, highlight mentors and mentors, be constantly around to support the novice.  Not just to teach a product or project, to teach how to work, because for the majority of young professionals we are the first employer.  But there are not so many BPM specialists in Russia, so we are happy to develop these specialists and replenish our ranks with the best. <br><br>  <b>Why do young professionals go to LANIT?</b> <br>  <b>Catherine:</b> Our company has a huge expertise, a large number of interesting and large-scale projects and, as a result, a productive development environment.  Young specialists do not always immediately understand or choose the right field of activity for themselves; you can try yourself in LANIT in different roles and choose the one that you like and get better. <br>  <b>Alexey:</b> The integrator company allows people to see a lot of specialties, work and decide on the right direction in IT.  Understand what you like and what not.  In the integrator for two years.  This is a fast growth for those who are motivated to develop.  LANIT is a large stable group of companies.  I worked in different companies, but I saw stable traditions and the way people value and value them, only here.  Here people learn to love their work and stop hating Mondays.  Do not spend time in vain. </blockquote><br>  As a result of communication with departments, it became clear that compensation and support of departments in conducting internships became a good trigger for participation in the program, but many of the managers see other incentives for themselves to work with young specialists. <br><br><h2>  What do young professionals think </h2><br>  We also regularly collect feedback from young professionals who have come to us to hear firsthand an assessment of our suggestions for career beginners.  I spoke with <b>Alexander Ulanov</b> from <a href="http://itlanit.ru/">LANIT-Integration</a> , <b>Anastasia Ovchinnikova</b> from the department of corporate systems of LANIT and <b>Madina Gntivat</b> from LANIT-BPM, who successfully completed the internship and have been working in our company for more than half a year. <br><br><blockquote> <b>Why did you decide to go to LANIT?</b> <br>  <b>Anastasia:</b> I decided to go to LANIT because I heard about this company, and I was highly recommended by her friend, who at that time was already working here.  Actually, the decisive factor was probably very good reviews about the company. <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> At the university (HSE) I received skills and knowledge in my specialty, but I could not take full advantage of them.  Therefore, I decided to go to LANIT in order to learn how to use them correctly, as well as to gain new and more valuable knowledge that they would not give at the university. <br><br>  <b>What sensations did you have from the internship and what did LANIT give during the first months of work?</b> <br>  <b>Madina:</b> I really liked the atmosphere in the team - calm and friendly.  Interesting projects, tasks that make you learn something new are exactly what I need now.  The internship gave a good base to start working on a real project.  During the internship, I first studied the platform itself, and then performed various tasks on an educational project.  At first it was difficult to understand how to perform a particular task, but gradually it became easier and the tasks were given easier. <br>  <b>Anastasia:</b> In the first months of work it was difficult and interesting.  It is difficult - in terms of immersion in the project and the specifics, but it is interesting, because every day I encountered new tasks, the solution of which was enjoyable and improved my knowledge.  As in the first months of work, I like the young team, the office and the general atmosphere in the company. <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> I really liked it.  Especially the fact that I was first at the facility.  The first months in Luzhniki and the office were very interesting.  I feel like a part of a large, well-functioning mechanism, a part of an interconnected system.  Although this time was not enough for the full acquisition of new skills, however, during this period LANIT gave me something really important - I can apply my knowledge in practice. <br><br>  <b>Do you recommend other students to start a career in LANIT?</b> <br>  <b>Madina:</b> To start a career in IT LANIT is well suited.  Here you can get experience in large projects.  Also, much attention is paid to personal growth and the study of new technologies. <br>  <b>Anastasia:</b> LANIT is definitely recommended for starting a career, as it is a big company with various directions where you can find a project that interests you.  It also has experienced staff who can learn a lot. <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> I think so.  LANIT can provide the basics of full-fledged work both alone and in a team.  After all, this is not taught in universities. <br><br>  <b>What are your plans for the near future?</b> <br>  <b>Anastasia:</b> In the short term, I plan to delve into the project on which I currently work.  But I still have many directions for development. <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> I think I will soon become the chief engineer.  Here you can develop.  Sit on the spot, I certainly will not. </blockquote><br>  Fine!  They like it.  We are on the right track.  The main thing is that the influx from the student galaxy should be constant. <br><br>  Therefore, to increase awareness among students, we carry out many activities. <br><br><h2>  How to reach those who we need </h2><br>  The main directions of the projects of the LANIT group are related to solving problems for the corporate (B2B) and public sectors (B2G).  There are many projects that increase our awareness, for example, the State Information System for Housing and Public Utilities or the Unified Medical Information and Analytical System (EMIAS), but most students know little about us, at times less than about companies in the B2C market. <br><br>  To reach students and graduates, we work with all the ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù universities (Moscow State University, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, Moscow State Technical University named after Bauman, Moscow Institute of Economics, Moscow Institute of Economics, Moscow Higher School of Economics, MIREA, MiSIS), we participate in job fairs, career days, exhibitions and conferences, on which we talk about us and our proposals. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ju/8p/hm/ju8phmvpgxi0ejzxeyf7xi4bnku.jpeg"></div><br>  To give students the knowledge necessary in our projects and to give the best of them a chance to get on the bright side of power, we conduct joint training programs in interesting and promising areas with a number of universities.  For example, these are several programs in the Higher School of Economics in the areas of BPM and blockchain. <br><br><h2>  What are the results </h2><br>  At the end of the year, more than 100 employees without work experience were recruited through internship programs, and in 2017 452 young professionals under the age of 25 were employed in the company in 2017. <br><br>  Analyzing our experience over the past years and the results obtained from the current project, we can draw several conclusions. <br><br>  First, the program structure was chosen correctly.  Internship programs, educational programs, work with universities, participation in various activities for students and financial investments in units working with young specialists allowed us to achieve the main goals: to interest business, make the company more ‚Äúvisible‚Äù for young specialists, in a number of departments to build system of fast and effective cultivation of young professionals. <br><br>  Secondly, not all the tools and channels for attracting young professionals have proven to be effective.  This year there were a large number of events of a different focus, where, according to the organizers, there is our target audience.  These are student case-championships and competitions, festivals, exhibitions, conferences, career guidance days and careers, job fairs and career forums.  Almost all of them, of course, are paid with various partner packages.  For all, a large audience coverage and the opportunity to talk about themselves.  In fact, in most cases, the possibilities of attracting a relevant audience are unnecessarily exaggerated, and are not supported by anything.  And sometimes the format of the event does not imply a story about us at all or, moreover, these attempts openly annoy the audience.  We also constantly offer many promotions, various portals or companies that can broadcast information about us on monitors and stretch marks in universities.  Most of these events or promotions do not have a correlation between our costs for them and the result obtained, which can be measured in the number of new responses or completed questionnaires.  At the moment, the most effective for us are participation in job fairs with specialized universities, targeted advertising of our internships and educational programs through e-mail newsletters or posts in groups in social networks from universities that are interested in finding jobs for their students.  The absolute leader is a targeted search for young professionals on the sites and direct interaction with them. <br><br>  Thirdly, the systematization of efforts to attract and work with young professionals has brought its results and the VITAMIN ROSTA program should be further developed.  To do this, we will increase the number of units that recruit interns and the number of internship programs, introduce new tools to attract and search for young professionals.  In the near future, we will begin to actively conduct hackathons on various topics and even use machine learning and BIG DATA in order to understand with maximum precision where the droids we are looking for are. <br><br>  And what do you think are the most effective tools for searching, attracting and immersing young specialists in projects? <br><br>  <i>PS But over the chips and superfast learning as in the movie "The Matrix" we will think about it.</i> <br><br>  Do you want to work in LANIT, fill out the form on the page "VITAMIN GROWTH": <br>  <a href="https://goo.gl/GYGQiR">Member Profile</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348310/</a></p>
