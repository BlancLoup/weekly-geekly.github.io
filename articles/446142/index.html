But a thinking person can get to the truth, sometimes studying seemingly unrelated facts or even making his own experiments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3v/cf/oe/3vcfoeemjz8_fhimrv8dchx1zaa.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Dark things </h2><br>  Last summer I had the opportunity to see a lunar eclipse.

      I was ready to enjoy the spectacle, but the reality was completely different, the emerging shadow was curved, as if the Earth was a ball! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/so/ei/ls/soeilsodjwzaegi_eafudddjadm.jpeg"><br><br>  This discovery deprived me of peace - have we really been deceived all this time, and the Earth is really a sphere?  It was necessary to investigate this question further.  Where and how can we notice the shadow of the Earth?  The most interesting is the time of sunset and sunrise.  From textbooks, we know that the sun shines on a flat earth like a lantern with a reflector, directionally.  Otherwise, the whole disk would be at the same time day or night, and now, with the spread of communication tools, you can call or write to a friend several thousand kilometers away, and find out what the Sun has already gone down or, on the contrary, has risen from him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d6/mr/wm/d6mrwmmhxmgjgnixbtkpjalwtaq.gif"><br><br>  This means that the border of day and night has a slope, and on a flat Earth, tall objects in the opposite direction from the Sun after sunset will be in the shade. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ol/qw/o5/olqwo51saigigfxaoqfqds6k3oe.png"><br><br>  And on the spherical Earth, on the contrary, skyscrapers or mountains will be illuminated by the Sun after sunset or before dawn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jz/0x/ce/jz0xcefmtpaekzrudpfk81h5ewk.png"><br><br>  And I not only personally observed the illuminated skyscrapers immediately after sunset, but, judging from the photographs of other people, this is ubiquitous.  It turns out that the earth is everywhere a ball! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yu/lr/ta/yulrta7lfgfblfhvqzfgu02dgcw.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://www.sunhome.ru/wallpapers/132650">A source</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hu/ou/mr/huoumr0wcnba51jvp7zd8amrpew.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://petrushanov.livejournal.com/25751.html">The source</a> , there is also a full size</i> <br><br>  And this is not all cases when the shadow of the Earth can be observed directly.  The clouds are above the buildings, and they are also illuminated after sunset or before dawn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jx/uz/0a/jxuz0awmdhj4kdczznhw75iti5o.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas_t/20865582671/">A source</a></i> <br><br>  We rise even higher.  The so-called ‚Äúrocket launches‚Äù can produce an amazing optical effect, but only if they occur shortly after sunset or before sunrise (the most interesting is from 2:21). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JRzZl_nq6fk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And finally, if we go to one of the sites of the Sharovar sect, which <a href="https://www.heavens-above.com/passdetails.aspx%3Flat%3D55.7558%26lng%3D37.6173%26loc%3D%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%26alt%3D0%26tz%3DRFTm3%26satid%3D25544%26mjd%3D58573.7320973895%26type%3DV">predicts the position of</a> bright points moving across our sky, then the case where the point goes out before reaching the horizon can only be explained by entering the Earth‚Äôs shadow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ia/lk/qi/ialkqizvxu1vfm2j4jegcvioni4.png"><br><br>  And finally, on a flat Earth at sunset, the Sun should decrease, move away from us, and increase at dawn.  Alas, neither personal observations nor numerous photographs of other people confirm this.  But on the spherical Earth the Sun just should not change the size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rj/qo/d1/rjqod1k3i6mqgmrn8axyvl-lmeu.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://fineartamerica.com/featured/sunset-multiple-exposure-dr-juerg-alean.html">A source</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Distances and movements </h2><br>  Amazing surprises await us in our travels.  The celestial sphere above the flat Earth should show the same picture regardless of movements to the north / south, however, for some reason, when moving to the south, new stars become visible in the southern part of the sky, and on the opposite side, the Polar Star, on the contrary, all lower inclines to the horizon.  Moving only 12 ¬∞ to the south, from Ufa to Sochi, I saw that the planets had become noticeably higher, and unfamiliar stars were burning in the southern part of the sky.  Even more amazing pictures will be visible if we look at the photos of the night sky in different parts of the Earth, taken with a long shutter speed, so that the rotation of the sky can be seen. <br><br>  In the northern hemisphere we see a well-defined axis of rotation.  Here, for example, Sweden. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1s/pw/oc/1spwocfcf3zxqvwp4t6289zb9dy.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/472385448384422341">A source</a></i> <br><br>  On a flat Earth, this axis would be visible from the equator, but this does not happen.  Here is a photo from Ecuador. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o4/pk/n1/o4pkn14d78tqxm_0pu-vzponlmk.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="http://sguisard.astrosurf.com/Pagim/From_pole_to_pole.html">A source</a></i> <br><br>  And in Australia, the second pole is visible, which is by no means impossible to observe on a flat Earth, but on a spherical one it should be there.  This photo was taken on Lake Eppalok, just north of Melbourne. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mj/g0/nn/mjg0nnebffaxbub5snej4qm6yvm.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/science-environment/2012/08/stunning-star-trail-photography/">A source</a></i> <br><br>  Observations from different points on the east / west line also provide interesting results.  It is easy to establish that the Sun rises over different cities at different times.  And with the help of familiar and / or webcams, you can measure the time of sunrise or sunset with fairly good accuracy.  Only this should be done in the region of the spring or autumn equinox, so that the border of day and night does not deviate much from the north-south direction.  I got 73 minutes for the Ufa-Moscow base.  The distance between the cities in the region of 1100 km is direct (on the road in the region of 1300 km, but it is not perfectly straight).  Thus, we find that the terminator line (the border of day and night) passes approximately 15 km per minute.  Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in days, we get 21,700 km - the circumference of the Earth at a latitude of 55 ¬∞.  From here we can find the length of the equator by dividing the resulting number by the cosine of 55 degrees.  21700 / 0.573 = 37800 km, which, given the low accuracy of our measurements, almost coincides with 40 000, which are spoken of in the Sharover sect. <br><br><h2>  The naked eye </h2><br>  The truths of a flat Earth become quite ghostly if you have a telescope.  Governments led by mysterious forces may tell us that demons or reptilians are flying across the chariot (like motorcycles on a vertical wall in a circus), but when the so-called ‚ÄúISS‚Äù appears in the sky strictly according to the schedule of the Sharover sect and You can see the "solar panels", according to textbooks that there is no space, somehow I can not believe it.  I personally saw these panels, but I directed my telescope with my hand, and it was not possible to make a photo.  But there are people who can take a picture, and it coincides with the words of sharover.  Official science tells us that rockets fall back to earth, but it is impossible to believe in it when the launched ‚Äúcargo ship‚Äù is visible in the sky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kp/rm/rq/kprmrqrgoiqg6onodqyukxs_ozi.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://twitter.com/kiwibacon/status/1014225108733480960">A source</a></i> <br><br>  Venus is another source of doubt.  Because if the Sun is closer than the celestial sphere, then Venus should always be visible as a circle.  But in her telescope, the phases are perfectly visible, and the ones that coincide with what the sharovers write - when they say that the distance to the planet is less than to the Sun, Venus is visible as a large sickle.  And when the marginal-sharover says that Venus is close to the ‚Äúorbit‚Äù point opposite to us, it is visible as a small, but almost complete circle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q0/if/v8/q0ifv8fxm9sneiq2_fw8e_uxjja.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://www.eso.org/public/outreach/eduoff/vt-2004/Background/Infol1/BIS-D1.html">A source</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Not a single light </h2><br>  The fact that the Earth is not flat is noticeable not only in the range of visible light.  First of all, there is such a thing as "satellite television".  If the Earth were a fixed center of the Universe, there could be no ‚Äúgeostationary orbit‚Äù in principle.  But for some reason there are ‚Äúsatellite dishes‚Äù on the houses, directed just to the south, where there should be impossible satellites.  And if on the territory of Russia the antennas are not looking very high above the horizon, then with decreasing latitude, they climb higher and higher.  In the equatorial area, they are directed vertically, and ordinary travel bloggers unwittingly reveal the existence of "geostationary satellites" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ou/b2/rn/oub2rnwht9sxa0ojzsxxn-diayw.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="http://www.rickmann-uk.com/index.php/2008/06/24/equator-pictures/">Photos from Indonesia</a></i> <br><br>  Land photographers also manage to photograph objects that are clearly not on the dome of the celestial sphere, because they move at different speeds than the stars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/my/yd/bm/myydbmsbzph8t4gzxfzofgxrd70.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/">A source</a></i> <br><br>  If the Earth were flat, then there would be no ‚Äúsatellite transponders‚Äù.  An ultra short-wave transmitter on a high tower could broadcast over long distances, and the transmission of the conditional Ostankino would be visible not only in Russia, at least to the Urals, but also in the USA (via the pole).  Airplanes would have been visible on radars throughout the entire length of the disk without difficulties with the ‚Äúover-the-horizon radar‚Äù, and there would be no stories of passenger liners missing over the ocean. <br><br><h2>  Sailboat blames </h2><br>  Even the history of shipbuilding contains evidence of the earth's sphericity.  The most famous tea clippers of the 19th century tried to take the shortest route possible, which made sense only in the case of the Earth's sphericity.  Movement near the Antarctic Wall is the longest route on the disk, and the clippers did not deviate towards India, as it would make sense for a flat Earth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g2/1r/xy/g21rxyyfpsictjlh82h8ffvgxv0.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Tea_Race_of_1866">Ariel clipper route</a> , 1866</i> <br><br>  Generally, if the Earth were flat, sailing ships would not have had to shorten the path, risking movement in the "roaring forties" of the southern hemisphere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rd/bq/10/rdbq109z9ozr9qyzgnh25iqc68w.png"><br><br><h2>  Epilogue </h2><br>  Truth gives a complete picture of the world and breaks even in unexpected places.  Personal observations, specially commissioned experiments, someone else's experience, even seemingly unrelated historical facts allow us to come to an unequivocal conclusion about the Earth's sphericity. <br><br>  <b>PS The</b> material was specially prepared for April 1, I hope that readers will forgive a slight irony in the form of inversion of conspiracy theories :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446142/</a></p>
