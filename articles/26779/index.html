Although recent observations of the state, the army and large companies are beginning to convince me that everyone uses it, but they do not admit it :) <br><br>  Initially it was a secret theory :) Ie  employees of the company should not have known her in order not to oppose the fulfillment of plans.  But today I am convinced that understanding the relationships within the team is necessary for all employees, because without it, sometimes it‚Äôs not possible to solve old problems or understand the causes of the actions of managers and employees.  Well, it just opens up even greater opportunities to achieve outstanding results in the company.

      In other words, I recommend this article to be read both by company directors or department heads, and by company employees.  Suddenly useful :) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>What is your company?</strong> <br><br>  The company is first of all people and relations between them.  This is a company relationship with customers and other companies. <br><br>  Up to 10 people usually departments do not yet exist.  But as the number grows, the head of the company does not have time to do much and must delegate authority to department heads, and then directors of directions. <br><br>  Of course, among the leaders there are stars, i.e.  people are born leaders.  But often the departments are headed by excellent specialists in their field, but not managers, from an administrative point of view. <br>  The director who manages the company cannot, for the most part, contact all the staff personally on all matters.  Those.  He would certainly like to do this, but his main task in the company is business development, development economics and strategic planning.  And in order to be in time, the director usually forcibly limits contacts with all the employees and sets tasks for the heads of departments and with them and asks the result. <br><br>  Forced or inevitable hierarchy.  Inevitable, since there is no doubt that the director had the opportunity to contact all the employees directly, many issues would be resolved more quickly and communication problems would be absent.  But in fact, it is considered that more than 7 subordinates (directions) the average director cannot effectively control. <br><br>  The emerging structure of subordination leads to the transformation of information during transmission from employees who are in contact with the outside world through the head of the department to the director.  Often the information is simply lost.  But trite employees without malicious intent (I'll talk about this later) interpret the information to the best of their knowledge, understanding of the situation and their personal attitude to the object of description.  So a technical support employee who has had trouble with some client reports to the head of the department that the client has terribly flooded his work plan and because of this the level of service this month has decreased from 97% to 90% and something needs to be done with such clients. so they don't eat up all the time.  The head of the department may not understand in detail that the delay was connected, for example, with an inattentive reading of the first question by his employee or even with insufficient staff experience in administering Oracle, will report to the company head that customers have gone muddy, have failed reporting and support rules need to be tightened.  Although in reality it would be worthwhile to train support staff and introduce simple regulations and divide problems into urgent or optional consultations ... <br><br>  And there are many such examples in ordinary business.  So I saw a procurement agent informing managers about problems with suppliers just because the supplier was a rude person.  Or the new procurement manager, although he should know the German language by requirements, does not like it and prefers working with suppliers who have excellent English, ignoring German suppliers that are more profitable for business. <br><br>  For some, it is important to ‚Äúwhat‚Äù is said, to someone ‚Äúwho‚Äù says, to the third ‚Äúhow‚Äù it is said. <br><br>  But this is only an example to accept the current statement. <br><br>  Managers, including directors, do not have full information about the state of affairs in the company. <br><br>  Is it worth it for the director to worry about and is it possible to avoid unwanted changes to the information?  :) I believe that this should be taken simply as a given, as taxes, as the weather and as an inherent property of its firm.  It is worth explaining to the employees the meaning and essence of quality information transfer and why it is important to distort information minimally.  Acting correctly and not strongly punishing people for mistakes, you can reduce distortion, but you will never be able to avoid it. <br><br>  We reviewed the movement of information from the bottom up.  And what about the top down?  Well, yes, you already understood.  :) Information, orders are also interpreted by employees and are understood by them on the basis of the information that they have in place.  Moreover, employees are often surprised by the ‚Äúgenius‚Äù of the management, which gives orders that are incapable of actually changing anything or which cannot be done at all exactly.  And the heads of departments and further their employees ‚Äúbring‚Äù orders to the possibility of fulfillment, somehow adapt them to life or simply ‚Äúslaughter‚Äù them, because already, reading the order itself, they formulate an explanation why the order could not be carried out.  :) <br><br>  Not everything is so fatal, of course.  We are still discussing the clinical case in order to understand the reason for the transformation of information within the company when moving vertically. <br><br>  And what happens between departments and are the connections between departments important for the company? <br><br>  It seems to me that for a company of up to 200 people, communication between departments is vital!  They need to be maintained and developed.  Information should be distributed between departments, ideas should be born, and plans for resolving situations should be developed.  Otherwise, the structure will become completely inoperative and closed to internal information. <br><br>  But what happens when distributing information between departments?  What do you think, if a development manager has a great relationship with marketing and he can sit down with a marketer and listen to him and understand concerns, just concerns, or first customer responses, will it be good?  Well, of course, it will be just cool!  And if marketing has a bad relationship with the technical writers department?  Well, Sonia Ivanovna simply does not like Darya‚Äôs manner of wearing provocative stockings and underwear that looks so funny for boys, and so annoying for girls ... This is NOT cool.  Well, it's just trouble.  You understand that whatever Marketing in the person of Sophia Ivanovna says to technical writers in the person of Darya, it will have the same meaning as if they tell each other's eyes that you can‚Äôt dress like that.  Rationality and the affairs of the company went into the background, in the first place will be personal relationships. <br><br>  <em>Reservation for my colleagues.</em>  <em>:) All names and plots are fictitious, for example and clarity :) No need to look for analogies and substitutions of names.</em> <br><br>  <strong>We are together!</strong> <br><br>  We will look at the company from the outside, as if it were not our child and his behavior did not depend on us as parents. <br><br>  The company becomes an independent organism, developing according to certain laws and consisting of organs - departments and cells - individual personalities.  The health of the company depends on the health of the departments and employees.  Concentration in a certain place of ‚Äúdark personalities‚Äù can lead to the death of a collective or to the amputation of an organ or its replacement with a new donor or modern prosthesis-outsourcing.  The most important are the organs that are responsible for the vital activity of the company, i.e.  food extraction and assimilation :) <br><br>  The distribution of information between departments and the quality of communication depends on the individuals in the company.  The presence of communication problems will necessarily lead to a loss in the quality of work, development prospects, and the possibility of using potential opportunities.  The head of the company must very carefully monitor the quality of communications, primarily between the heads of departments.  If there is a problem in communications, you should try to solve it.  But often it is not so easy to do or even impossible.  The director will have to compensate for the quality of communication with his participation, meetings and more detailed control over the work plan.  Or get ready for an amputation or transplant. <br><br>  The company interacts with the market as an independent organism with other independent organisms.  The acquired knowledge and contacts from the outside world are transmitted unevenly within the company and, depending on the quality of communication between departments, some minds reach and do not fall into others. <br><br>  Personality in a company of up to 200 people plays more value.  I think that even with a larger number of companies, the features of top managers are crucial for the development of the company.  Well, again, as a fictitious example, if the representatives of the companies in the CIB have bad relations with representatives of the RIF, or vice versa, we will all be puffed up and go to two conferences.  :) <br><br>  Considering all of the above about the quality of information transfer within the company, it can be stated that the company is inclined to independently interpret the tasks and goals set by the management, modifying them to the possibility of application ... and all this is entirely out of good intentions!  :) <br><br>  <strong>All people are good!</strong> <br><br>  In the entire history of the work I have not met hopelessly bad people.  All people are good and in all their intentions they strive to be successful in terms of modern society, honest and do not lie unnecessarily, try to follow the instructions of the management to the best of their understanding, show creativity only for the benefit of the company, as it seems to them. <br><br>  It is also completely clear that people tend to work less and receive more.  It is very natural and it drives progress. <br><br>  People often want to learn and for this they do not what you ask for them, but what they want to learn.  Often they do not think about why they learn something, but almost no one keeps any bad intentions in their heads. <br>  Heads of departments and companies do not specifically want to create problems for employees, try to set tasks fully and comprehensively, try to do their job as a manager well (to the best of their understanding) and help employees do their work for the benefit of the company (as they think). <br><br>  All act on good intentions!  <strong>This is a mantra!</strong>  Repeat it every time you go to a meeting, every time it seems to you that the other head of the department has pressed you or pushed your job or responsibility onto you.  Feel free to ask the person publicly if he acts out of good intentions. <br><br>  The task of the leader is to identify people who repeatedly commit acts aimed not at ‚Äúpositive‚Äù, but at ‚Äúnegative‚Äù and destruction of relations of trust.  At the same time, pay attention only to actions, and not to beautiful and correct words.  Perhaps these people are simply not working in the company.  There will definitely be a team that will appreciate their abilities and for which the actions of these people will be good. <br>  You can not try to make people of robots.  People can't work evenly well ... <br><br>  <strong>Coordinated unevenness</strong> <br><br>  Everything in nature is cyclical.  Day and night, moons, orbits, seasons of the year ... <br><br>  The hormonal and emotional background of men and women is cyclical.  As for women, we kind of reliably know this, but for some reason, it‚Äôs not written about men in textbooks.  But men are the same.  Everyone remembers the sinusoids of sentiment, intelligence and something else there ÔÅä <br><br>  All employees want to be always strong, smart, have time for everything and never make mistakes for months and years of work.  But in reality, we are all ordinary people.  We sometimes make mistakes, we have problems in personal relationships, problems in relations with colleagues, we can‚Äôt write the code equally quickly within a month, we speak equally well at seminars ... <br><br>  The company can not claim 100% uniform performance of a person.  Uniform performance is generally a legend.  Of course, there are different productivity and efficiency of people, which is determined by the mass of personal, educational and historical factors.  For some, the decline in productivity is equal to the peak of a neighbor‚Äôs career.  But still, each of us knows that at times we don‚Äôt want to work, we cannot begin to sort the mail, we don‚Äôt want to get out of bed ... <br><br>  There is one outstanding fact that shook me.  This was some kind of research during the USSR.  In large companies, we found out that the menstrual cycle in women within a team or working group is synchronized!  But exactly the same synchronization takes place in men in emotional and intellectual and apparently hormonal rhythms. <br><br>  Emotional relationships between employees in the company are synchronized! <br><br>  A company is a living organism with its own cycles, bursts of energy and drops of potency to life.  And all this is not only inevitable, but also normal.  These are the laws for a living organism. <br><br>  Yes, apparently, after all these analogies, they will send me to the Faculty of Biology to complete my education.  :) But I still continue to talk on the subject.  No wonder you mastered so many signs ... <br><br>  By the way, apparently the company should have moments when the director can conceive a new idea or accept childbirth :).  Or there is time for safe sex :) it will be necessary to think about this topic, it suddenly occurred to me. <br><br>  <strong>Short-term push</strong> <br><br>  Well, we frowned and began to look at our company differently.  We no longer doubt the unevenness and understand the consistency of human relations within the company.  It became clear the feature of information dissemination and communication between employees. <br><br>  We will lift the body out of bed and push it towards a certain goal. <br><br>  While we are at point A. Employees received a modified market information.  We will collect some of the information from the market independently.  We will hold a series of meetings and discuss point A. with the staff. <br><br>  Having collected our thoughts and spirit, we choose the period of our emotional uplift (the rest should have already been synchronized with you), set a goal and task publicly or in other words, push the company in the right direction from point A to point B. The director‚Äôs task is to carry out the most complete information team tasks on the transition, put in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãemployees and light the fire on the transition!  ‚ÄúHooray for the motherland!‚Äù Is heard in the ears of the director and staff ... :) <br><br>  All employees involved in the process should know that the company moves to point B and to point B another 4 ... 3 ... 2 weeks.  It helps each of us to coordinate our personal plans, holidays, family interests, late arrivals, work on weekends ... <br><br>  4 days before the release of the new version of the product at 10 pm, I‚Äôm taking Max home from work, his wife calls him, and he calmly answers her: "Honey, you remember, we have a release on Monday, we‚Äôve already left, Sergey is lucky I'll be home in 10 minutes. ‚Äù  If your mother-in-law knows that you have a ‚Äúrelease‚Äù, she will surely help your wife pick up the children or cook dinner.  Let everyone know that you are going from A to B, that tomorrow you will launch a submarine, that the launch of the rocket is scheduled for the morning, let the sky help you :) <br><br>  The period of transition from point to point is very important.  It is advisable to set the transition in 1-3 months.  Well, 4-5, but not more, with each month the probability of dying on the road increases by no less than a quarter.  You can set a longer period, but you can only increase the tension 4-6 weeks before coming to point B. <br><br>  Considering that the achievement of the goal is stretched in time, and the director and the heads of departments and employees should strive to ensure that the tension of efforts increases when approaching point B. <br><br>  Moreover, the date to reach point B is a thing that should not be discussed and questioned.  Point B is the place where we find ourselves on the appointed day and set time. <br>  All this I call the ‚ÄúShort-Term Push‚Äù.  The goal, time, all the resources to achieve the result! <br><br>  <strong>Got it?</strong> <br><br>  It is necessary to analyze the results of the movement from A to B strictly within the established period.  In no case can not wait until you get to B. Just came to the set date, stopped and analyzed where you came from and where the same B. <br><br>  For the most part you will not find yourself in B. This is practically impossible.  Why?  Namely, because you, when setting tasks, had distorted information.  Because your employees interpreted your orders to the possibility of their implementation.  Because the firm is a living organism, constantly interacting with the market. <br>  The place in which you find yourself we will call point B. And this is usually not far, very close to point B. But you could not walk, could shift to the side, jump over ... <br><br>  The goal was adjusted because: <br>  * difficulties in technical implementation <br>  * implementation method was slightly changed, because there was resistance from the market <br>  * but managed to go further in implementation <br>  * but marketing is lagging behind because they do not know how to communicate with developers <br>  * did not develop documentation, because developers do not want to communicate with anyone at all, who do not speak C # <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Being at point B, the director has a new perspective. This allows us to formulate a new goal and form a new vector for the company, taking into account the new data obtained. It is not necessary to go to point B - you </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">need a complete change of purpose</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">While the director is analyzing the place in which the company finds itself, employees are resting from the stress of the previous weeks. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why should everyone know?</font></font></strong> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Is it worth telling everyone how you manage a team or what processes are going on in a team?</font></font><br><br>        ,    .   ,    ,           , ,      .   ,   ,     ,         .      . <br><br>          .      ,   .      ,   .    ,           . <br><br>   ,        ,         .          ,        ,    . <br><br>  ,        ,      ,        .            .         .  ,    ,       ,         . <br><br> <strong>   ?</strong> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Warranty in your head. :) There are no other guarantees. Moreover, inevitably you will be faced with the fact that you will not be able to synchronize well enough, agree, agree. There will be people who will leave the project at the most crucial moment. But there will be great victories, and the achievement of results, the joy of communicating with colleagues. What do we still do not know in this life? :) Everything is already described in books and blogs. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Avral or system?</font></font></strong> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> It can be said that I justify and introduce abruptly into the rule as a method of control.</font></font> But this is not at all the case.
