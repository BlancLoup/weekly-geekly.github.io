 Everything has an essence and weight -
 Ship as a man
 The name needs to be desperately.
 You don't give a name for nothing,
 I will tell you in advance:
 What do you call a boat,
 So she will float!
 What do you call a boat,
 So she will float!
</pre><br><br><br>  This is a song from a wonderful Soviet cartoon that was filmed in the midst of the Cold War.  The war, in which the capitalist and socialist systems fought a fierce propaganda and economic struggle for a place in the sun and the possibility of continued existence. <br><br>  In this war, valiant spies fought on an invisible front with insidious scouts!  Is there something wrong?  Oh yes!  It was the scouts who were valiant, and the spies were damn cunning!  Wordplay or intent propagandists?

      This war ended long ago, but the experience and effectiveness of its propagandists has not gone away.  Today, their knowledge spawned SOPA - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">Stop Online Piracy Act</a> <br><br>  And now, dear reader, I will ask a few questions that every thinking person must think about today. <br><br><h4>  1. Who and when decided to call free distribution of information the dirty term ‚ÄúPiracy‚Äù? </h4><br><br><h4>  2. What is the threat? </h4><br><br><h4>  3. What to do? </h4><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  In the beginning was the word ... </h4><br>  So begins the most famous book of antiquity - the Gospel.  Dozens of cultures, hundreds of teachings and thousands of educational institutions throughout the history of mankind understood the importance of the Word and the Name.  Modern capitalism has created such a thing as a brand - a word that has a value of billions of dollars.  The word can sell, inspire, oppress and even kill - Guilty! <br><br>  A curious fact.  The system of financing science in the United States is structured in such a way that it is almost impossible to get a grant for a new study if the name of the topic has already been met by a commission.  However, it is worthwhile to invent a new name for the old theme, and no complications arise!  In this absurd, at first glance, the rule laid a powerful mechanism for the natural selection of terminology.  As a result, modern science speaks English. <br><br><h4>  So who thought up using this stupid term for free copying? </h4><br>  The Internet is surprisingly sparingly describing this phenomenon.  It is reported that the term has been rarely <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0">tried to use</a> since the Middle Ages.  However, the most intensive use of the term has emerged in recent years in the media industry exactly at the end of the Cold War. <br><br>  Today, the term <b>Piracy is</b> directly included in the name of such legal documents as the <b>Stop Online Piracy Act</b> .  Hundreds of millions of ordinary law-abiding citizens from different countries around the world will soon officially receive the stamp of robbers and robbers. <br><br><h4>  What does it threaten with? </h4><br>  In the dashing Russian 90s, in the wake of surging freedom after the breakdown of the socialist system, strong muscular guys emerged who offered services to protect the emerging business from their own kind.  Consonants paid tribute, dissenters were cauterized with irons.  These guys called themselves racketeers.  <b>Racketeer</b> became the idol of youth, and racket a buzzword, although in reality they were ordinary dirty thugs. <br><br>  In respectable 2000s, rekeptors changed raiders.  These intelligent guys set off whole gangs of people in masks and with weapons to seize the largest enterprises in Russia.  Medieval pirates are just babies amid riches captured by raiders.  However, no one ever called these people modern pirates.  Because they had enough brains to think about the image, and enough money to buy ideologues and journalists. <br><br>  Does Richard Gere look like Edward Lewis - the raider from the movie ‚ÄúPretty Woman‚Äù on a dirty bandido? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/546a3ffd/0492a24d/f993b24e/86806b4d.jpg"><br><br>  However, with respect to ordinary people, journalists, politicians and lawyers (residents of the top selling professions) continue to persevere with the term ‚ÄúPiracy‚Äù in order to create a feeling of inferiority, fear, a guilt complex.  This is done from mercenary goals and for these purposes completely certain money is allocated.  This is what the well-known leader of the open software movement Richard Stallman said: <br>  <i>The term ‚Äúpiracy‚Äù has been applied to unauthorized copying for propaganda purposes, to create a subconscious analogy with maritime piracy, including looting, robbery, kidnapping, murder, taking hostages, sinking ships and other bloody violent crimes.</i> <br><br>  Fear is one of the most powerful incentives to part with money.  Racketeers, raiders and lawyers of media companies - these real pirates of our time are well aware of this.  Threaten a person for copying a file or listening to a song with a prison term of 10 years, is this not the worst robbery of modernity? <br><br><h4>  What to do now? </h4><br>  Favorite question of the Russian intelligentsia, which is never the strength in the traditional kitchen gatherings with strong drinks.  Everything ends with a stormy discussion of the first question "Who is to blame." <br><br>  I offer my recipe. <br><br>  <b>It took me 7 days</b> to think about and accept the thoughts outlined below. <br><br>  We need to start with the words.  Change terms.  Change thoughts.  Change reality. <br>  You can start today. <br><br>  1. No More <i>Piracy</i> ! <br>  There <b>is Hacking - Hacking</b> , as an activity to reveal the limitations imposed on software or content.  And there is <b>Syderism - Seeding</b> , as an activity for the free dissemination of information. <br><br><br>  2. No More <i>Computer Pirate</i> ! <br>  <b>There is Sider - Seeder</b> , a person or organization that spends its RESOURCES and TIME for FREE free distribution of information. <br><br>  Sider is a free man of a new digital era, which is unthinkable without the free exchange of information.  You can compare it with Prometheus carrying people of knowledge. <br><br>  3. No more <i>Licensed copies of the product</i> ! <br>  There is a <b>copy of the product with disabilities - Disabled copy</b> .  In the era of digital freedom, the restriction on free copying is one of the most painful product flaws, as it dramatically restricts the possibilities <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0">open by Metcalf‚Äôs law</a> <br><br>  4. No more <i>Pirated copy of the product</i> , <br>  There is a <b>Clad copy of the product</b> or an <b>Opened edited copy of the product</b> <br><br>  5. <i>Copyright (opyright)</i> - has exhausted itself.  Instead of a way to protect the rights of the author to own the product of his labor and receive remuneration, he has become the main brake on digital progress.  You can not make a collage, create a post with a photo in a blog, translate the track to the film, because the original product is protected by Copyright.  Even if you create a masterpiece 100 times more popular than the original, you will be forced to destroy it under the threat of criminal prosecution. <br><br>  Instead of the copyright, you need to create a <b>Origin (Origin)</b> - a set of concepts that protect the author of the work.  In conditions of complete freedom of copying and ease of modification of information protection of the author's originality will become the main task. <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b4b01371/9a159c15/8bd69298/0b140fbd.png"><br>  6. One more term is missing.  It‚Äôs time to call the situation correctly when a handful of people usurp the copyright of long-dead people and extort money from society for many years.  Copywriting is a strong word, but it will be incomprehensible to the English-speaking public.  A little digging in the dictionaries, I found quite a book <b>brigandage</b> and <b>brigand</b> This is almost the same as a robber or a pirate, only on land.  The peculiarity of the etymology of the word is that the brigands were originally called quite regular troops in uniform and with light weapons.  However, these troops were remembered not by guarding peaceful settlements from enemies, but by the commonplace robbery of the surrounding inhabitants.  Today, so-called armed thieves as part of an organized gang.  Why not copywriting? <br><br>  Thus, it is now possible to say briefly that I stand for the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/p2p/128642/">Siderov</a> and against the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/copyright/132795/">Brigands</a> <br><br>  This post is just an attempt to designate a course of action and to awaken the thinking energy of people of the information age.  7 days is enough time to come up with, discuss hoarse and adjust the new terminology.  You can just get used to it for a week. <br><br>  However, it will take years of consistent and painstaking small steps to turn terminology into an ideology, its introduction into the mainstream, jurisprudence, and record keeping.  Therefore, it is necessary to begin today, right now, in order to agree on terms. <br><br>  Copy, translate, quote data text on health, not forgetting (Origin) Begetan! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132846/</a></p>
