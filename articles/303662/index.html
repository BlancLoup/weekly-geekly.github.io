  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do you see well</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the segment of wired broadband Internet access, according to many analysts, the growth associated with the increase in the subscriber base is almost complete, so operators will have to offer their subscribers additional services one way or another in order to maintain their position in the market.  In the field of pay TV, this situation is also not far off.  Almost all commercial television operators have realized this trend and are seeking to increase the share of additional interactive services in their portfolio.  Another important area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity for operators that requires close attention and investment is improving the quality of users' perception of video content.  No one argues with the fact that television programs should be provided in the best quality, allowing the user to get maximum pleasure from watching, rather than experiencing negative emotions due to the delay, loss or ‚Äúscattering‚Äù of the visual or audio stream. <br><br>  What technologies and tools will allow commercial TV operators to quickly adapt to the changing market reality and offer their subscribers not only better service, but also many additional services?  This, in particular, was much talked about at the CSTB-2016 Forum that took place in Moscow this winter, which was sponsored by Huawei as a platinum sponsor. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Already in 2015, according to Huawei, 61% of video traffic was transmitted over fixed broadband access, and 4% through mobile.  According to forecasts for 2020, the share of video traffic transmitted via mobile networks will increase almost tenfold - to 37%, while the share of fixed broadband access, on the contrary, will decrease to 46%.  Every year the video content becomes more and more qualitative and, accordingly, heavier.  Already no one is surprised by 4K video.  Moreover, it is already possible to talk about the prevailing market ecosystem around 4K video.  If in 2015, only 200 films were shot in 4K resolution, in 2016, 5,000 such films are expected.  One of the first broadcasts in 4K was the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi.  This year, Huawei broadcast 4K video over record distance.

      Finally, if in 2014 only 20% of the sold TVs supported 4K, then in 2017 there will be 93% of them.  The number of carrier services supporting 4K is also growing.  The aggregate revenue from one subscriber (ARPU) with Internet providers falls from year to year - this is a steady trend.  A 4K video is one of the few chances for operators to increase it.  Huawei‚Äôs product portfolio already has <a href="http://www.huawei.com/ru/about-huawei/newsroom/press-release/hw-475551.htm">solutions</a> that enable the operator to provide 4K video in their networks.  Even if the subscriber does not pay the operator additional money for such services, their very presence is an excellent incentive for switching to more expensive tariffs, with a large amount of traffic or a higher channel speed. <br>  The main criterion for the quality of the transmitted video content is user or subscriber satisfaction.  If the quality level is not high enough, the subscriber will not watch the video and, accordingly, purchase the corresponding services from the operator.  How to measure and evaluate it?  For this, Huawei offers the <a href="http://www.huawei.com/en/mwc2016/topics/u-vmos-defined-network-architecture%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dposts%26utm_campaign%3Dru_social">U-vMOS methodology</a> , which Konstantin Kolovsky, the senior manager of the marketing department at Huawei Russia, told the CSTB-2016 forum participants. <br><br>  The development began in 2009 by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which created the vMOS standard, which determines how to evaluate the quality of video content transmission to subscribers by the technical parameters of the data transmission network.  During this time, the networks, terminals, and the video itself have changed.  Huawei has refined the vMOS standard so that it allows us to obtain a subjective assessment of user satisfaction with the quality of the video content received in a variety of conditions (terminals, networks, etc.). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/592/eae/164/592eae164c6e42da874de1377d8c8b0a.png"><br><br>  The subjective satisfaction of the subscriber from watching the video is tied to the technical parameters of the network.  In the process of developing the U-vMOS standard, various parameters were analyzed: the physical movement of the subscriber's eyes, the physiological state of the body, changing under the influence of emotions from viewing, as well as the results of user surveys.  To assess the U-vMOS, a five-point scale is used, where 5 corresponds to the ideal picture without any defects and distortions, and 1 to the generally unacceptable level of quality.  The first set of quality criteria "Content" is formed on the basis of parameters such as resolution, frame rate and color gamut.  Accordingly, they depend on the starting and ending points of transmission of the video stream ‚Äî the content server of the operator and the subscriber‚Äôs terminal.  The second set of criteria "Download" is formed on the basis of user interaction with the network.  It includes such parameters as the search time for content, the time it began downloading and viewing it, and the time for switching channels.  The third set of ‚ÄúPlayback‚Äù criteria is based on the evaluation of broadcast quality.  This includes such parameters as the level of image distortion, and for video on demand - the frequency and duration of stops.  On the basis of all these three sets of criteria, a special formula is compiled by which the value of U-vMOS is calculated - separately for broadcast broadcast and for video on demand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f70/e77/aa8/f70e77aa87244cee996dd2664ece5511.png"><br><br>  The score that determines the quality of the content depends on the complexity of the video and the size of the display.  For example, the picture of a football match is more complicated than the picture of a golf competition, since the number of moving objects on it is larger, and the most difficult will be the picture of a water polo competition.  Also affect the final score: the resolution of the content, the codec, the speed of data transmission in the network and frame rate.  Each content resolution has its own threshold of quality level.  In particular, in Full HD, it rises just above 4, but up to 5 is not enough.  4K resolution can already rise to 5, but at data transfer rates of less than 20 Mbps, 4K picture quality will be lower than that of Full HD. <br><br>  The score, which determines the quality of user interaction with the network, depends on more subjective parameters, since different subscribers are ready for different waiting times for switching between channels.  In the case of viewing video on demand, a rating of 5 is assigned with a delay of less than 100 milliseconds, and 4 - 1 second. <br><br>  The score, which determines the quality of viewing, is made up of the following parameters: for linear TV, this is the frequency and area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ‚Äúscattering‚Äù of the picture, and for video on demand, the number and duration of stops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c70/0ab/cde/c700abcde3a8438faf8390a0a567cbba.png"><br><br>  Based on the above, Huawei has prepared recommendations for network parameters for different types of content and different codecs.  So, for a network of fixed broadband access and content transfer with 4K resolution, at least a speed of at least 54 Mbit / s is required, and the optimal speed is 100 Mbit / s.  At the same time, the delay fraction should not exceed 20 milliseconds.  Similar recommendations exist for various types of networks, including mobile ones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303662/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303662/</a></p>
