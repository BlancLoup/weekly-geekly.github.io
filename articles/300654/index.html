    <h4>  <b>Top 5</b> </h4><br><br><ul><li>  <b>Radislav Gandapas</b> </li></ul><br>  "Antikash in the head" - this performance, perhaps, should be called an introduction to business and even to all training programs.  The name already says a lot.  Using examples from his own experience, Radislav talks about that without which it is impossible to achieve any goal or several goals.  Until you define for yourself the main tasks, there can be no question of finding ways for them. <br>  And here you should remember the main advice - you shouldn't wrestle, torture yourself with insomnia and constantly look for your own way.  You just need to open yourself - and the goals will find you yourself.  You will understand that this is yours, and you will clearly see ways to solve the problem. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MILuBpHHO80%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhZ8sF98PpqfgaVHx8RSm0QRAh-jA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  How to understand and do this - see his exclusive interview with Vladislav Chelpachenko, the host of the Winning Secrets program. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Tarasov Vladimir</b> </li></ul><br>  Team management requires talent.  Is always.  To be precise, this is art, without which you can never overcome conscious or unconscious opposition from like-minded people around you and your own team. <br>  The training "Managerial Management 2.0", became a classic among numerous speeches by other authors on business management. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEvFdqpmRDc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhW3T04o7-6aSskTN-Xi85fulkp4Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  You will learn to see and understand your own mistakes and will find practical advice on how to get out of conflict situations and personnel management, learn how to manage your team and be it not just official, but also a real leader. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Mann Igor</b> </li></ul><br>  Igor is one of the leading Russian business trainers, marketing practices, as well as the speaker of many training programs on curricula at the University of Synergy.  His speeches are always particularly useful in that they allow us to better understand how successful Western entrepreneurs conduct their business.  The application of his knowledge in practice gives significant results, this is a kind of impetus to those who are looking for the right ways and are ready to use the accumulated international experience in their business. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZEOfAspO4ZQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgRtO4LTWGFa5DUyda9n47Zjq-bXw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Look at one of his speeches - "How to become number 1" and you yourself will understand what is the main engine in the modern business world. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Itzhak Adizes</b> </li></ul><br>  This person, who has been engaged in the theory of successful business for 50 years, whose advice and recommendations are always heeded, because this is not just theoretical research.  His works and live performances are always topical answers to the most pressing questions. <br>  Adizes is familiar in many parts of the world, he taught at the University of California, advised world leaders on economic issues.  His books and video lectures are especially relevant when the world is again on the verge of another revolutionary change in the economy. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7rx__iGh-gw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj45R-iMv9cFPoHtCU2QRvK95pSMQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  To understand what we listen to live webinar Yitzhak Adizes "How to manage the organization in a period of unpredictable changes." <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Gleb Arkhangelsky</b> </li></ul><br>  One of the existing founders of the Russian school of time management, Gleb, is a person who questioned the truth ‚ÄúTime is money‚Äù.  In his writings, he constantly reminds listeners that time is a non-renewable resource. <br>  In the speeches you will find a lot of explanations why business success costs much more than can be measured with a chronometer. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4oS6bQjmxYs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjNwjQzMaC7IGMC9E8VxdMeOK0FgA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  As an example, see one of his live webinars "How to manage to live." <br><br><h6>  <b>findings</b> </h6><br>  Continuous self-study and business development are inextricably linked.
