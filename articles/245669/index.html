The time for summing up and thinking about plans for the future is for those who generally have a tendency to do this.  In an attempt to give our plans a concrete look and greater realism, many of us resort to setting our own goals for the next year.  I have been doing this for more than one year, for myself and other people.  There are things that contribute to the success of goal-setting (+), and things that can nullify the whole point of this exercise (-).  I want to share some observations on this matter.  I hope some of them will be useful to you.  So. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Instead of entry.

      Time is the only irreplaceable resource.  Even strength, even attention, not to mention money - everything can theoretically be replenished.  And time flows exclusively in one direction.  Every hour.  Seriously.  If you think that you have 30 active years, it is only 175 thousand hours of wakefulness.  They need to eat, wash, work, move in space, have flu, talk on the phone, listen to other people's complaints, and so on and so forth.  Every momentous action and every petty nonsense glorify invaluable minutes on an equal footing from this very stock.  It's like football, where it is considered "dirty" time.  Therefore, it would be nice to spend it on something that is valuable to us. <br><br>  1. Why goals? <br><br>  (+) Why do we set goals, and even set ourselves deadlines for their implementation?  There are two good reasons for this.  First: we want to understand what we really want.  Second, with the help of certain techniques of setting and tracking goals, we want to increase our chances of achieving them (by increasing motivation, focus, self-discipline, etc.).  And the one and the other is fine, and in good time. <br><br>  (-) But!  You should not resort to setting goals if you feel that planning replaces real activity.  Or that you are inclined to this feeling of guilt for the fact that time is passing, and you are not doing anything and are not moving anywhere, the fear that you are probably missing something important.  Believe me, it's better not to do anything than do anything. <br><br>  2. Process-result <br><br>  (-) It is considered that, in formulating a goal, it is necessary to determine the specific desired result.  In the miserly abbreviation SMART, the first letter (Specific) means a requirement for concreteness.  But!  Do not forget that this ‚Äúcounting point‚Äù was invented by managers in order to evaluate the actions of OTHER people!  In the corporate world, this is often a bare convention (such as increasing sales not by 13, and not by 17.3, but by exactly 15%!). <br><br>  In addition, an excessive focus on return, on result, eternal glancing at the clock, eternal feeding of inner greed often prevents the real fruitful working excitement from opening up.  It's like every hour to count how much money you earned, based on your salary divided by the number of working hours in a month.  Without the joy of the process, without immersion in its logic and its reality, it is impossible to live (remember Ivan Denisovich, who is laying bricks!). <br><br>  (+) For your own aspirations, process goals are often much better suited than process results.  For example, not ‚Äúlose weight by 10 kg,‚Äù but ‚Äúfour times a week, run 5 km and not eat after 19.00‚Äù.  And if you do so, it is an undoubted success, even if in the end you have lost only 8 by weight. Remember: you can really control only your actions (what you give), not their results (what you get ). <br><br>  3. Scale <br><br>  (+) Determine for yourself the appropriate scale of goals. <br><br>  (-) One side.  A goal is not a dream.  The goal has a closer horizon.  The goal is attractive because it is reachable and mobilizes by its proximity.  Many talented people noticed: what their lives led to was the best thing they could have dreamed of.  But daily, with tremendous dedication, the work went on at the level of concrete, final steps.  Having a dream is fine, but the goal is more ‚Äúoperational‚Äù.  The goal is to ‚Äúbecome a miner‚Äù if now every month you intercept money until your paycheck is nothing more than idle daydreaming, fruitless manilovshchina, or, according to my friend‚Äôs apt expression, catching trousers with clouds.  To no action this will not make you move. <br><br>  (-) On the other hand.  The goal - a landmark rather large.  Do not shrink, do not write down quite passing points.  The list of goals is not a grocery list in the grocery store, not something that you can just take and do.  They should not be too much.  But on the other hand, each goal should have a specific element of the challenge, designed to change (your) life for the better, at least a little. <br><br>  4. What to want? <br><br>  (-) We often tend to strive for something by inertia.  It is mindless to transfer to the next year the goals that were not achieved in the previous one.  Want something that would be pleased with our mother.  Or grandmother.  Or, on the contrary, how could she (mother) be annoyed, having shown independence.  Or compensate for what was missing in the past (as in the joke about the bike and Bentley).  Or how you can wipe your nose familiar.  Or something that has long been accustomed to be considered desirable.  Or something that people want around.  Or something that, on the contrary, favorably distinguishes us from others (faster, higher, stronger!).  All this is rubbish, loss of time and energy, running on the spot, lost war.  Throw immediately this empty occupation! <br><br>  (+) Set a goal - YOURSELF!  Not what you need ‚Äúfor something‚Äù, but something that is valuable in itself.  Do not make a goal "to make a million" if you need it to feel safe.  Instead, aim to directly "achieve a sense of security."  The path to it (sensation) may lie not through a million, or a billion, but through something completely, completely different.  Do not target an expensive car (apartment, house, yacht, plane) if it seems to you that others will respect you more.  Instead, set a goal to ‚Äúearn the respect of others,‚Äù and even better, ‚Äúto understand why the respect of strangers is so necessary for me that I‚Äôm ready to work all my life for him.‚Äù  You will be surprised how deceptive are intermediate, inconclusive goals! <br><br>  5. Correction <br><br>  (-) Everything in life is changing.  It is our mood to the national currency rate.  From marital status to health.  Such is the given.  And to match this reality, our goals can and should change.  Do not cling to goals that are no longer relevant!  This is not a manifestation of integrity and strength of character, but a simple obstinacy and fear to admit their mistake.  Not a minute choke on what you already ate!  Do not continue the wrong! <br><br>  (+) Ruthlessly erase from the list a goal, the achievement of which no longer represents value for you.  Free up your resource of time, effort and attention for a new, relevant, what really defines your life now. <br><br>  6. Spheres of goal setting <br><br>  (-) Now they are saying a lot that goals fill with energy in one or another sphere of our life.  And where we do not want anything and do not strive for anything, there will be no life, no movement.  Therefore, let's define our social roles - 5 or 10 pieces - and in each role we will outline 3-5 goals.  Thus, we will hold the whole front of our life, and no sphere will subside.  And in our life harmony, balance, balance will prevail, which, as we know, is the most important factor of happiness. <br><br>  However, in reality, the extrusion of goals, where there are none, where attention does not flow, what one does not want to waste time and energy, does not fill these areas of life.  It is impossible for a long time and fruitfully to do something for which there is no internal impulse.  It turns into a painful obedience, and there is no such discipline that will ensure success on this path. <br><br>  (+) On the other hand, if in some direction ‚Äúrushing‚Äù, then it is necessary to concentrate on it, without being scattered on the fact that ‚Äúit is necessary, yes, reluctance.‚Äù  Do not worry, the excitement in this area will not accompany you forever!  The wind of your preferences will change ten more times.  And there will be time and scatter, and collect, and hug, and dodge, etc., etc.  In the meantime - strive with all your might for what is the inspiration right now! <br><br>  It seems so far.  Thank you and good luck in the New Year! <br><br>  - In collaboration with <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/amikityuk/" class="user_link">amikityuk</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245669/</a></p>
