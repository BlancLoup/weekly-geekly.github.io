      In contrast to domestic difficulties with the informatization of medical services, <b>Maxim Ignatov</b> , a project manager from <a href="http://e-legion.com/">e-Legion</a> , told the audience about his experience of working with several major hospitals in the United States of America.  There, the health care system and medical care are built on a completely different principle than in Russia. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Inna Ashenbrenner on the implementation of information systems in Russia </h4><br>  In the framework of the ‚Äú <b>Electronic Russia</b> ‚Äù project, <b>KORUS Consulting</b> implemented the Federal Standard Medical System, which is allowed for free distribution by medical institutions.  However, only a small part of our hospitals are ready to introduce this and similar systems. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CZ0zIYuzFPQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhijWZV_7xa2UvPV3347fRabKgtiCg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/elegion/ss-7410726">Presentation</a> <br><br>  The second information system developed by the company is called <b>‚ÄúRisar‚Äù</b> and is a system for monitoring obstetric aid.  About her testing, problems and prospects for a long time arguing in the hall after the performance of Inna Viktorovna. <br><br>  Inna Viktorovna also noted that the Russian government allocated <b>24 billion rubles</b> for the modernization of IT systems in the medina for the next two years. <br><br>  Information technologies in medical institutions are not yet available in most parts of Russia.  ‚ÄúBecause when you do not have aspirin, but there is an iPad - this is cool!‚Äù Summed up Inna Viktorovna. <br><br><h4>  Maxim Ignatov about the US healthcare system </h4><br>  The information system for American hospitals combines several smaller subsystems.  And it allows you to take into account the patient's electronic cards, a patient‚Äôs history throughout a person‚Äôs life, the taking of drugs by patients and the reaction to them, the work of nurses, doctors and pharmacists of the hospital.  Such systems in the United States have a high level of information protection and patient privacy, as well as a system of protection against disruptions.  The programs do not stop working even in the event of a complete power outage at the hospital, but continue to record the condition of the patients and signal the need to take medicines or perform other necessary operations. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dw0wAQxY2hU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgbFxLRwDj4pQlHUTM29ntTHS9eGA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/elegion/it-7442559">Presentation</a> <br><br>  In his speech, Maxim recalled the notorious TV series Doctor House and explained that what we see in this and similar films is indeed the reality of American public health.  The only difference is that electronic assistants, combined analytical reference books of diseases, treatment methods, drugs, an archive in which all the used methods and medicines used by US doctors to treat certain diseases often help genius doctors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b3/4ef/2b4/4b34ef2b4a7837d98eccf79f89ee3f44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Maxim expressed confidence that an effective health care system would be built in Russia one day, making it possible to monitor the health of citizens and provide the necessary assistance in time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif" alt="drupal analytics"><br><br>  In addition to presentations by employees of well-known companies with experience in developing software for medical institutions, young innovative medical projects were presented at the meeting. <br><br>  Thus, <b>Daria Mokrova</b> , the founder of Speckle-Diagnostics, <a href="http://www.dp.ru/a/2011/03/29/V_Peterburge_razrabotali">told about the non-contact diagnosis of</a> human bioparameters using sensors based on the principle of pulse wave fixation.  The sensor measures the vibration of the skin surface and microcirculation inside, and its reliability is equated to the results of a standard ECG. <br><br>  In addition to Daria, <a href="http://www.dp.ru/a/2011/03/30/Rekviem_po_genialnoj_idee2">Andrei Dodin, a</a> representative of the Zvorykinsky project in St. Petersburg, presented a very interesting project.  The so-called <b>Maxygen</b> device is created to simplify and speed up PCR diagnostics.  Early and affordable (cost of analysis will be 10 rubles) diagnosis of infectious diseases using such a device will significantly reduce mortality. <br><br><img src="http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/7992/99656761.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If we talk about the 18th meeting of the Club of Innovators in general, it was very rich, the hall was crowded, those who were late were forced to stand at the walls and in the corridor.  It was noticeable that the topic of informatization of medicine is very important and painful for our country and the world as a whole. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  We, the e-Legion company, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/e-Legion/vacancies/">are looking for</a> two <b>C #</b> programmers to develop the very information systems that Maxim Ignatov was talking about.  You will be able to participate in a very important project, as these systems really work effectively and save many lives. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117366/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117366/</a></p>
