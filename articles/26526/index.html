  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problems of modern IT education.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The current situation in Russia in the field of IT is paradoxical at first glance - there is a huge need for IT specialists, but REALLY few people prepare them.  Computer science at school is not even an introduction to an IT specialty.  This is, at best, computer user courses, at worst, fairy tales about the power of computers.  Computer science in high school - standard set: 1st year - Pascal;  2 course - C;  + Computational methods and rarely where - some practical courses. <br>  The adequacy of this proposal to the requirements of the market, let's face it, is zero. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The reasons for this are many: <br>  1. <strong>Lack of human resources.</strong>  A rare (very rare) computer science teacher has experience in the IT industry.  IT specialists are so lacking that even frankly average cadres are being washed out of education. <br>  2. <strong>The rate of change in the content of education.</strong>  In the opinion of the teachers working next to me, the best textbooks of the Russian language are post-war, mathematics textbooks of the 70s.  IT knowledge is becoming obsolete by half in 2-3 years. <br>  3. <strong>Lack of adequate teaching methods.</strong>  Here you can simply remove the caps and quietly shut up.  Any of the courses known to me is divided into many fragments with little connected with each other.  Often the same algorithms are written in the first year in Pascal, in the second they are written in C. The school course is generally full of isolated facts and skills, without trying to bring them into the system.  Most do not understand what is the connection between binary numbers, Boolean algebra, algorithms, programs, machine code, the operating system and his favorite shooter. <br>  4. <strong>Formal interest of the parties in the results of education.</strong>  Modern school is not interested at all in the final result.  Only in student writing tests.  Which, are selected so that the thought about wrecking comes.  Universities prepare students for a particular specialty and are not interested in students leaving a 3-year course in business, earning an order of magnitude more than teachers. <br>  <strong>So, the situation needs to be changed.</strong>  <strong>AS?</strong>  <strong>IMHO - SOLUTION IS!</strong> <br>  This is an additional education.  Yes, yes, yes ... A variety of circles, studios, electives, etc. + Web 2.0 technologies * the cumulative intellectual potential of the RuNet = formula for raising IT education. <br>  How it may look in practice. <br>  At the basic level, this is a circle (for example, the ‚ÄúHTML-code cutting and sewing circle‚Äù), + a site on the Internet where the circle members publish their work.  At the age of 10, just the page ‚ÄúMy Favorite Butterflies‚Äù, in 12 dynamic HTML, at 14 knowledge of php is already added, and so on.  So by the 3rd course you can get a ready-made IT specialist.  But to this must be added the COMMUNITY.  First of all, the community of IT specialists, which oversees the students.  Correct "childish" errors, etc. Ie people who determine the content of education.  As well as the community of teachers who do not determine the content of education, because they are not strong in IT, but they determine the direction of education.  Plotting individual creative routes pupils.  They can be called fashionable now with the word "Tuters". <br>  <u>And now about the interest of the parties.</u> <br>  <strong>Students</strong> acquire practical work skills; by the end of their studies, they form a portfolio that has long become a freelancer diploma. <br>  <strong>IT specialists</strong> receive a platform for generating and testing new ideas, a place where ideas crystallize in their pure form, not burdened by technological / commercial pressure.  Another rating - puzomerka on the principle of "Who teaches the best, he is right."  If the resource becomes popular, this rating will have an impact on potential employers.  And, finally, the altruistic motive - ‚Äúto help children is sacred‚Äù. <br>  And the <strong>teachers</strong> , finally, will be able to do the usual PEDAGOGICAL work: to pull the lagging behind, to give creative tasks to the advanced students, to upset them so that they are not impudent, etc. Ie  do what they are strong at.  And not to try once again to reinvent the wheel, multiply cattle coders and cripple children's souls with their loser complexes. <br>  I wanted to add a small technical task, but then I decided - not worth it.  You are specialists, and I'm just a big fan and enthusiast.  So I will be glad to any help.  If you are interested - write.  Treat this offer as an invitation to a non-profit startup. <br>  Thank you in advance. </div>
