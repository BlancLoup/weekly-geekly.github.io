A rather large catalog, in some places the truth is truncated (for example, Arcade Fire has only 2 albums in stock, and everything that was previously 2010 is missing), but this is not about that now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1.

      I have a Motorola with an amoled screen (the black battery does not eat), and indeed, the application in the white-yellow color scheme is not the best option, everything is fine during the day, but in the evening and night you can use the phone screen as a flashlight if you launch Yamuzyku. <br><br><h4>  2. Offline mode, and in general, the library and a little about the recommendations </h4><br><br>  That's why I bought a subscription, the ability to download tracks to the cache and listen when there is no normal Internet connection (and in the Crimea it has never been anywhere).  There is no separate item in the menu for these most saved tracks, the most convenient thing to do is to create a playlist, add music to it and then save it to you in one click.  You cannot save an entire album (only those tracks marked with a heart (‚ÄúI like‚Äù) will be saved. If I press ‚ÄúI like‚Äù on an album - the tracks do not work at all, they are not marked with this icon and I can download the whole album to myself immediately I still can‚Äôt. Simply speaking, when I go somewhere, I just go to ‚ÄúI like the tracks‚Äù and poke one of them one by one, this is inconvenient, or I go to my albums, I go to one of them I understand that in order to deflate the whole album, I still need to mark each and every track and only then click on ‚Äúska  to do everything. ‚ÄùThen, for example, I press‚Äú mix everything ‚Äù, and then, hallelujah, the application plays only what is downloaded, but continues almost after each track (after all, I‚Äôm pumping out with spaces in the general list) informs that I am offline mode and this is not comme il faut. Well, the covers are cached through time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ce/155/010/3ce155010f244ffead0ce69629f553f3.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d76/8dc/d80/d768dcd80aa548198f07ac813997f73a.png"><br><br>  Recommendations - they are good, but not in the case of foreign music (pandora / spotify and xbox music understood me better, mb because of a larger catalog at least in Pandora and Microsoft service), but with Russian performers everything is fine, 3 months ago I I listened to almost nothing of the kind, but Yamuzyka changed it. <br><br><h4>  3. Scrobbling (last.fm) and Yandex Disk </h4><br><br>  Until a certain point, I thought that the application does not have scrobing, I downloaded simple last fm scrobbler and a couple more applications with this functionality, but none of them caught Yandex music.  After that, I wrote to tech support where I was told that the service, regardless of my desire, scrobbles music, if this function is enabled in the settings of the service itself in the web version (and if I am not in offline mode).  I have nothing against it, but this could be indicated somewhere.  At the same time, the moment about the offline mode and setting up the wi-fi / mobile Internet remains unclear, I can turn off the use of the mobile Internet, it is clear - but it is not clear whether scrobbling works? <br><br>  In general, it would be much cooler if someone from Yandex screwed the Yamuzyku to Simple Lastfm Scrobbler, because its source code is open and a lot of people use it, propiar a little at the same time: D <br><br>  About Yandex Disk is also unclear, there is a mention in Wikipedia that they say that since November 29 last year you can upload your tracks to Disk and listen to them from Yamuzyka, where will they be displayed?  Why is this not indicated anywhere?  (It turned out to be a small item of settings, although Google with their Music used this almost as the main feature of the service for a long time). <br><br>  That's all, I hope someone from Yandex will read my nagging, and (to which I do not even hope), pass it on somewhere) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375409/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375409/</a></p>
