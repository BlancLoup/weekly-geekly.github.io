      And taaam ... eyes run up.  Five travel guides to Spain, 3 to Portugal, 9 to France, 6 to Germany, 2 to Poland. <br>  The whole suitcase can be hammered with books alone. <br><br>  And for those who know English, life is even more difficult - there are about 10 times more travel guides. <br><br>  Can we go back home and look on the Internet?  No, even worse ... You start looking - the texts are very superficial, and shamelessly repeated 10 times on different sites.  Want to dig deeper, too, there is, but everything is scattered.  Structured no. <br>  And you will not take all this with you; you cannot rewrite the whole Internet to your brain. <br><br>  And once we thought: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And how to make such a guide, which <br>  a) always with a traveler <br>  b) contains the most comprehensive information about each attraction <br>  c) weighs nothing <br>  d) cost nothing <br>  d) you will not forget him at home <br>  e) always available <br>  g) unobtrusive, but always at your service <br>  h) always fresh, contains information about offers, prices <br>  i) maybe a prompter - what to do, where to go <br>  k) and still, it would be great if it would be compiled by tourists for tourists <br><br>  How do you like this technical task? <br><br>  <b>Travel Guide 2.0</b> <br><br>  Actually, everything turned out to be quite realizable.  Enough to expand the consciousness and in the field of view will get all the necessary technological tools. <br><br>  The technology is all there, so our invention is ready.  Indeed, this is not an invention.  This is just an innovative mix of different technologies.  Let's think together. <br><br>  What is always in our pocket?  Phone.  We take the phone. <br>  We take the person - the excursion guide.  What do we want from him?  Vote.  We take. <br>  We take the radio broadcast.  What do we want from her?  Button on-off and availability in each city. <br>  We take the map scheme.  What do you want?  Binding the object to longitude and latitude. <br>  Take the Internet.  What is it?  Base of knowledge about everything.  We will take. <br>  What is left there?  Oh yes.  What is this magical way to deliver a voice from a guide?  Obviously, headphones.  We plug one end into the ear, the other end into the phone.  The phone went to the Internet, said its coordinates, and the server returns to the phone the voice of a guide who talks about this particular place. <br><br>  We called this service - <a href="http://toozla.com/">Toozla</a> <br><br>  <b>Where does it work?</b> <br><br>  That's what's interesting.  There is something to tell about each house in Moscow‚Äôs Kuznetsky Most street.  In books, guidebooks and online resources you can collect a lot of interesting stories.  We did it.  The result was a really interesting excursion.  Compared to audio guides on CDs, it is much more saturated.  Every home is history and modernity. <br>  And listeners can add, tell their own stories themselves. <br><br>  Some of our colleagues did not like the voice of Kuznetsky Most.  Indeed, this is not a professional, it was our first experience. <br>  There is an alternative - the announcer-robot named Olga.  Olga read the contents of the site of the Tsaritsyn Museum-Reserve.  Actually, you judge how well it turned out.  Tsaritsyno Park: the history of the place, the palace and all the buildings - is now available in the mobile guidebook. <br><br>  Also, in agreement with the Vilnius Municipality, we moved the audio guide in Vilnius to the Toozla-platform.  Turn on Toozla, and listen to the guide in 5 languages!  Which one do you like better?  English, German, Russian, Lithuanian or Polish? <br><br>  <b>And where is Web2.0?</b> <br><br>  Where do without him ... :) <br>  Toozla users can create content themselves by slandering their audio notes about a particular place directly into the phone.  And right on the spot, that is, on the street or in the park.  This stream of consciousness immediately goes to the server and becomes available for listening to everyone who is in the same place. <br><br>  <b>Who will pay for everything?</b> <br><br>  As you remember, the initial idea was free for the user.  How to achieve this?  There are two main options.  Both are simple and obvious: since the service is similar to a radio broadcast, we can insert ads into the audio stream.  But advertising is not simple ... Imagine, a husband and his wife are walking around the city, listening to a tour, the time is nearing dinner ... and here they simultaneously hear two different messages: the husband: ‚ÄúThe Seventh Seal Restaurant is the largest pork knuckles in the city.  Today a special offer for Toozla users is a great side dish for free.  Open the big carved door with the sign of the Seventh Seal a few steps from you! ‚ÄùWife:‚Äú Restaurant Seventh Seal is a real tiramisu for dessert.  Today, a special offer for Toozla users is free coffee! ‚Äù <br><br>  The second option is monetization - users pay for each tour, but this is if they receive some premium content, for example, a guide from Michelin. <br><br>  <b>And what about the market?</b>  <b>Is there a market?</b> <br><br>  According to our estimates, the volume of such a market can reach 9 billion dollars a year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58845/</a></p>
