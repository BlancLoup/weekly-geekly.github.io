In short, this is a kickstarter, where you can not just give money to cool guys, but invest, that is, get a share in the profits of a future project. <br><br>  <b>Today I can say that we managed to start crowdinvesting in Russia.</b> <br><br>  But the road was quite long: <br><ul><li>  First I had to do a very serious legal binding to make it work.  More is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartmarket/blog/171007/">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartmarket/blog/172523/">here</a> .  We found a way to do everything online, without signing papers. </li><li>  At the same time, a platform was created where project organizers can upload their information, where they can follow the teams they like and directly invest in one click. </li><li>  Then it was necessary to find the first projects that want to participate in equity investment.  We reviewed the order of hundreds of different options - from the bakery in Tver to all sorts of IT-portals.  Almost everyone in the system is now closely connected with IT.  Here is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartmarket/blog/162157/">checklist of questions</a> for each project. </li><li>  And finally, it was necessary to overcome the enormous resistance of people who do not believe in crowdinvesting.  There was a feeling that all those who have never worked with investments consider this an exquisite way of withdrawing money from the population. </li></ul><br>  Today we have a ready-made solid legal base, a technical platform with the ability to receive funds on the fly, the first projects (past rigorous selection) and quite a few applications of interest to buy a share in the profits of different companies. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Below, I will direct directly the projects that we currently have. <br><br><h4>  Bocco </h4><br>  Service search vacancies in restaurants.  Important for large cities.  It will use data from the restaurants themselves and their software, statistics for past periods, data from their users, open sources such as chekinov, and so on.  The main strength of the service is a powerful Data Mining based on heuristic algorithms, which allows you to predict the load even of those institutions where data does not come from at the moment.  Details are in a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartmarket/blog/175575/">separate post</a> .  This project was most positively perceived by the habrasoobschestvom, most likely due to clever work with information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b0c/ae5/663/b0cae5663d9c36a434bb409f2171bb5a.png"><br>  <i>Red dots - no tables, green - there are places</i> <br><br>  The main task of the service is to gain a critical mass of users (as they work on the quality of the algorithm by participating in the search for tables), so crowdinvesting is a good opportunity to get detailed feedback, improved algorithms and interfaces, and after the changes are made - the first loyal users who will be interested in product distribution.  <a href="https://smartmarket.net/projects/bocco/">All the details</a> can be viewed at our site. <br><br><h4>  Bemarried </h4><br>  Service, where you can find everything for a wedding on the check-list, plus the exchange of performers - photographers, presenters, and so on. <br><br>  We are now at an age when one of our friends every month organizes a wedding.  It is difficult to choose from a huge number of suppliers of wedding services, it took a tremendous amount of time, and it is also difficult to navigate the prices of wedding services, as they sometimes differ by more than 2 times. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The story of the founder about the project</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Existing resources facilitate only some aspects, but do not solve the problem completely. <br><br>  First, the main portal will be created, on which a virtual platform for organizing a wedding will be implemented.  After that, the partnership base will be worked out, as well as testing the platform on partners with whom there are already oral agreements and mutual interest in cooperation.  In parallel, the portal will be beta-tested on clients, mostly from friends. <br>  The portal will be a virtual service for organizing a wedding. <br><br>  The client, registering on the site, will receive all the necessary information explaining the work of our site, which is quite simple.  The client will be able to fill in an application form free of charge using the proposed form, with criteria that meet his requirements for wedding services, and publish it, specifying also the dates he needs to receive the finished offer.  After moderation, the application will be divided into several "tenders" and published on the portal.  All partners who provide the required services (for example, companies engaged in renting a limousine, will receive a corresponding application, etc.) will receive notifications via SMS and e-mail that a ‚Äúbidding‚Äù has begun on a specific application, after which they can leave their ‚ÄúBid‚Äù on the portal, including the price for which they are ready to provide the service, contact information, their portfolio, availability schedule, etc.  The client will see the progress of the ‚Äútrades‚Äù in his personal account, and after the end of the ‚Äútrades‚Äù he will receive a full sample of service providers ready to provide these services.  Further, the client can continue to organize the selection on his own or order the free service of a personal manager who will individually organize his wedding. <br><br>  Thus, a client in a short period of time and for free can get a list of all service providers that fit his criteria, and not spend weeks and months on telephone calls and visiting a much larger number of service providers, and will also receive more lucrative offers in connection with with competition from suppliers at the site. <br><br>  Promotion in SMM will be targeted at female audience, female forums, groups and communities.  The virtual ‚Äúbridge of love‚Äù, where you can attach your lock online, will also solve the problem of attracting customers.  Regarding agreements with government agencies to promote the project, we decided to move ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù and have some agreements with the prefectures of the districts, so the issue of advertising in the registry offices will be easily resolved. <br><br>  Smartmarket.net was chosen because cooperation adds value to projects, since only carefully checked projects are placed on the site, and therefore, the investor will understand that the project has passed this test and represents a potentially interesting goal for investment. </blockquote></div></div><br>  <a href="https://smartmarket.net/projects/bemarried/">Details on the portal</a> . <br><br><h4>  Takeitnow </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù mobile application for remote booking and purchase of tickets for entertainment events in metropolitan areas.  Over time, the system studies the user, his tastes, where he is, what events he attends, etc., after analyzing this data, weather conditions, geolocation and social activity of the user, the application offers him the right entertainment options, thereby increasing the possibility of buying.  Here are the <a href="https://smartmarket.net/projects/takeitnow/">details</a> . <br><br><h4>  Backatyou </h4><br>  The project is being developed to structure the process of exchanging comments and working materials between the contractor and the customer.  Unlike task trackers (Basecamp, Megaplan), the project is aimed at working with graphic images, text documents and presentations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7bf/d50/49e/7bfd5049e101118cde0c9dfdb0c14311.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The story of the founder about the project</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Even while working as a head of a digital agency, I had to control the creation and coordinate a large number of designs, presentations, KP, contracts, etc.  Gradually, an idea began to emerge - to create a tool that would speed up and systematize the process of exchanging comments in the process of discussing and agreeing on similar tasks. <br>  We have been trying to find competitors for quite a long time, but we have not found one either in Russia or even in the world.  There are convenient services like skitch, dropbox, base camp, etc., which partially implement the tasks of the project, but only have to be used at the same time, while keeping Word and Excel included.  There is not a single project that would be used to edit, compare and comment on a large number of versions of a single document (site design page, presentation page, contract page, billboard layout, etc.) and, while working together, would allow to leave footnotes and make notes right on the document.  We have never found any functions like ‚Äúdownload the entire project by pressing a single button‚Äù or ‚Äúuploading the whole history of work on the project‚Äù, and this can be very useful for archives or in case of disputes. <br><br>  The very first release will be intended for freelancers and small agencies.  We are planning to start developing and launching a more complex corporate version and adding the ability to work with presentations and text documents after the official launch of the project. <br>  There is a 6th year, as I gain experience in this area.  I started with a rather interesting startup of my own, which was successfully launched, then sold and safely stored by the new owners.  With the money received, a digital-agency was opened with colleagues, in which it was fortunate to work on a large number of interesting projects and create more than one startup for the agency's clients. <br><br>  From crowdinvesting we are waiting for opinions, advice and criticism.  This is most important for any startup other than the investment itself.  It is difficult to make an ideal project right away, so any opinion, criticism or advice at the design stage is extremely positive for the final result. </blockquote></div></div><br>  <a href="https://smartmarket.net/projects/backatyounet/">Details</a> . <br><br><h4>  Pick-flick </h4><br>  Mix from YouTube + Skype + iTunes.  Want to learn English with a tutor living in London;  order the wedding of your favorite actor as a toastmaster;  take a guitar course;  get advice from a doctor, lawyer, financier;  chat with a famous businessman and even have dinner with him;  learn the secrets of a magician or just watch a new movie?  Come to Pick-Flick, choose by rating, reviews and price, the right author (or copyright holder) and go! <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The story of the founder about the project</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Somehow, quite a long time ago, I came across a site where a magician showed wonderful tricks, and for a fee offered to buy videos with the secrets of these tricks.  The site was written ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù, but coped with the functionality.  Gradually, I began to notice more and more areas in which the service of selling video could become popular.  During the development process, it became clear that demand is wider than just selling videos and you need to provide paid online communication. <br><br>  The product is already possible to say working.  We are now ‚Äúcombing‚Äù the site and within 3-4 weeks we will be ready to launch it in beta testing. <br>  We communicated with completely different people of different professions and hobbies: doctors, lawyers, tutors, trainers, and even predictors.  I will not hide the fact that not everyone clapped their hands, but most clapped.  And recently, the owner of a well-known company asked us to help with the implementation of the educational film they made. <br><br>  Crowdinvesting?  If you leave only the essence, the Smartmarket is the only guys who were able to offer transparent rules of the game, and who at the same time see us as quite fair.  At the same time, for me, crowdinvesting is the first ‚Äúbattle‚Äù test, the first assessment.  It is very important!  People don't just vote like or dislike.  Those who will be ‚Äúfor‚Äù will take the risk and entrust me with their money.  This is a great responsibility! <br><br>  Case 1 (from life): The guys decided to create a high-quality educational film.  They attracted professionals, invested a lot of money and got excellent material at the exit.  Now the question is: how to monetize it?  Roll up on discs and sell in bookstores?  Pick-Flick.com is the obvious solution.  As I wrote before, they have already addressed us. <br><br>  Case 2: Suppose you want to learn English.  But not just to learn, but to really!  And it is desirable that an Englishman, who certainly lives in England, teach you.  You are welcome!  Come on Pick-Flick.com, choose the desired category, teachers (by reviews and rating), see where it comes from, and go!  Watch his free video or buy some pre-recorded lessons.  Liked - start full-time communication.  All in your hands! <br><br>  Case 3: Feeling bad?  Visit Pick-Flick.com and consult a famous doctor. <br><br>  Case 4: Want to have dinner with Warren Buffet?  Look, maybe he is already on Pick-Flick.com. </blockquote></div></div><br>  Details <a href="https://smartmarket.net/projects/pick-flick/">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  4Fingers </h4><br>  4Fingers is a mobile social network for evaluating places and events with friends.  With the help of ‚Äúswipes‚Äù of 4 fingers, you can quickly and easily assess the places visited. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The story of the founder about the project</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating 4Fingers came by itself while working on another project on the organization of virtual exhibitions and videoconferences.  Using actively various mobile applications, I noticed that there is not yet such a social network where you could quickly and conveniently evaluate a restaurant, a hotel, a movie, a performance from a mobile phone and immediately share this rating with friends.  On the other hand, I would like to have on hand a rating of such places from friends, people whom I trust, and, accordingly, follow. <br><br>  I often have to travel, and on the road this need increases many times over.  Once in New York, for example, I know for sure that a dozen of my friends have already been here, but I won‚Äôt call them questions where it‚Äôs really tasty and interesting.  They will not remember, and if they recommend, it is quite possible that the place will not be nearby, but at the other end of the city. <br><br>  Even at the alpha version stage, we held a public demonstration of the application, took part in the Moscow Techcranche and received positive feedback from reputable experts.  Of course, we were asked: "And how are you different from Foursquare?" But here everything is obvious, when you come to a place, you are checked so that your friends know where you are.  And when you leave a place (waiting for an account, for example), with the help of 4Fingers you can check-out, or rather, evaluate the dishes served, the service, the atmosphere of the place, so that friends know whether to come here in the future.  The assessment process can be very quick if you hurry (without a single letter of text).  Or maybe more thorough and interesting, with tips and advice.  These ratings are further structured in such a way that aggregate ratings are created within your circle of friends, with which you can search for the best restaurants, car washes, banks, and places for recreation according to your circle of friends. <br><br>  Following the results of the Moscow Techcranch, we met Smartmarket.  Soon they offered to participate in crowdinvesting on their site.  Of course, we are not only interested in the financial side of the issue, we expect our potential investors to become active users of the service, help with their expertise and advice to develop the project ... The most difficult thing to check was to take a polygraph test, especially when asked questions about intimate life.  Just kidding  In fact, first of all, our documents were checked, and there was a clear plan for the development of the project.  We have worked out these points, so we found a mutual understanding with the first meeting. <br><br>  4Fingers is now in closed testing, in which several dozens of users take part, some of whom are well-known experts in the industry.  The activity of even a small number of critics is pleasantly pleased.  New checkouts are constantly appearing in different countries of the world.  From our users, we have already learned about many interesting places from Canada to New Zealand. <br><br>  Before starting work on my own projects, I had more than 5 years of work at Kaspersky Lab - perhaps the most successful Russian IT company on the international market. </blockquote></div></div><br>  <a href="https://smartmarket.net/projects/fingers/">More on the site</a> . <br><br><h4>  Fairy kingdom </h4><br>  Fairy Kingdom - game for iOS, three-dimensional logical platformer.  The closest analogues are the cult projects The Lost Vikings and Trine.  The game has three main fairy characters traveling through the magical forest.  Each of the characters has unique magical abilities needed to solve puzzles and successfully complete game levels.  The development of the game is engaged in the company of Holy Warp. <br><br>  An interesting case of a circumvention with the help of crowdinvesting of the main rake when searching for an iOS investor is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartmarket/blog/169517/">separate post</a> .  But <a href="https://smartmarket.net/projects/fairy-kingdom/">other details on the site site</a> . <br><br><h4>  MyWishBoard </h4><br>  The first mobile social wish list, with the possibility of collective buying gifts to a friend (to collect the necessary amount for a gift together), social microcredits and automatic search for favorite products, photographed through a mobile application in online stores.  <a href="https://smartmarket.net/projects/mywishboard/">Details</a> . <br><br><h4>  Platformaster </h4><br>  Applied exchange of interior designers and builders.  The goal of the project for a simple user is to adapt the "housing problem" on the Internet  The user can find design and repair artists, form a repair budget or state his own, get advice, speak about the quality of work, materials, etc.  For designers and construction and finishing teams, a unique and free platform to advertise their activities, display completed orders with an objective assessment of results, which in turn will allow an ordinary user to choose the best option in the selection of performers.  <a href="https://smartmarket.net/projects/platforma/">Details</a> . <br><br><h4>  Amsrus.ru </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d1/649/823/9d164982362ed83d187dd65a85a75303.jpg"><br><br>  A kind of Habr for motorists, based on the rubric of choice of Aslanian and other materials of famous journalists.
