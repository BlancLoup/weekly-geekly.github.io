There will be some emotionally about Apple.  And second, - once I was an Apple Evangelist.  Now there is no. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e6/8ab/73d/8e68ab73d35c70eebd33790f75b1282c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ... <br>  Back in 2010, being in America, I bought the 1st iPad at Applestor.  This iPad has lived up to the 5th version of its OS with something and told me that it will not take any more versions.  With a bunch of applications inside that stopped being updated, but did not stop serving, he continued to live in our apartment without a cover, protective film and other Labuda, surviving among three children and two dogs with cats ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ... And I must say his condition, at the same time - that is, with complete disregard for the means of protection, turned out to be better than some "young" devices: neither cracks and chips, nor scuffs - only a few subtle scratches, but a dent on the aluminum back - it seems that something fell on his knee.  And that's all.  Everything!

      Of course, old age is not a joy - it almost ceased to be taken into its hands - occasionally sometimes they read books on it and watched unpretentious websites, forums mostly.  And after a while, they were completely thrown into the back drawer as unnecessary ... And just recently, this summer, when we were going to Crimea by car, we suddenly remembered that an old friend could still serve his service.  It was decided to pour films on him for the children on the road.  The smartphones of all huddled to the eyeballs, the tablets we didn‚Äôt take root somehow, and here the road is almost a day long, plus long evenings in the room after a swim.  Well, do not you watch tv?  And so I pulled my good old First ipod out of the dusty box.  Found a dead gray wire already.  I connected to iMac: I waited for it to charge and boot.  And, finally, I went to it through iTunes.  The first joy: "aytyunz" sees it!  The second one - uploading files in AVPlayerHD works!  Hooray!  Everything is as before!  Ta-dam!  Highlighting pre-downloaded fresh movies (while the device was charging), I ‚Äúdropped‚Äù them onto iTune‚Äôs window and folded my arms across my chest, waited for the download to finish.  Loaded slowly but surely.  While the process was going on, I decided to free up more space: I was shooting ‚Äúheavy‚Äù applications, music, photos, thus I released a couple more ‚Äúgigs‚Äù ... Everything was going like clockwork.  The films finally began to sway, the time was later, tomorrow morning, on the road ‚Äî the road ... I was getting ready to send everything to sleep and go to sleep myself, when suddenly, seeing that the very liberated ‚Äúcouple of gigs‚Äù were left, he decided to pour a couple more episodes ... I throw files and suddenly I see: "The device has run out of space."  - Oh, yes, you must click on Sync after the operations of deleting applications!  I shake ... "This computer is not authorized ..." E ... What a trifle, now we authorize, especially since I remember the password well.  "Your account has been blocked for security reasons."  Chchcherr, this is worse.  Yes, I haven't used my account for a long time.  And the unlock procedure began, however, short.  When from the browser I ‚Äúaltabnulsya‚Äù again in iTunes, I was dumbfounded.  No not like this.  I was speechless - while the browser window curtained my entire screen ‚Äî everything was gone on iPAd'e!  Literally!  He "dropped off", "descended", "zeroed out" - as you wish.  ‚ÄúNo, no, ... wait!  I know that I will not be able to pour more applications from AppStor into you!  - flashed through my head.  - Wait, what about the films just filled in?  And the time spent?! .. How are the children who finally lose films?  Hey! .. What a joke!  I did not press anything, did not make unnecessary movements!  You said log in and behold, I did it!  Where is all lost? !!! <br><br>  I broke through a cold sweat.  12 am, early morning departure.  There remained the prospect of "soft reset" and the inability to download applications from the store.  Since the application for the 5th version of iOS is simply not there.  As there is no possibility to put another OS on it.  ‚ÄúI know, I know it: there is a jailbreak.  But jailbreak options are not rolling.  Lack of time and experience, plus accumulated fatigue during the day, which, however, began to disappear somewhere ... ‚ÄúBackup!  - I almost shouted - and rushed to look for it on disks, folders and partitions, but a minute later I remembered that a few years ago I replaced the old disk with SSD ... that the old disk was somewhere in a junk pile formatted ... and with it into oblivion and all possible earlier backups ... "No ... you have no backups ... And here is a quiet obsessive thought that this iPad, glowing in the night, served me for many years, survived and quite fit for resurrection, resurrection ... Some minutes turned into a brick.  In a piece of ... glass and aluminum.  And wow.  At the wrong time! <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, we just won't give up so easily - a thought flashed through my mind.  Who are we, managers?  Coaches?  Mraketing workers?  Not.  We are IT specialists.  We are fighting for the device to the end.  For the fact that it works, and does not pretend like everyone else ... <br><br>  Thought: iCloud!  There, in this dustbin, surely something is lying.  I go, go to the "My Applications" section, download AVPlayerHD from the cloud!  It seems to work ... Or not?  Uff ... downloaded!  Hooray!  The application appears on the iPad.  Really ?!  I do sync ... woobs.  Disappeared.  I click Install again ... appeared on the virtual iPad screen in iTunes! .. sync ... disappeared!  Vaguely, but I understand that the cloud does not store "specifically my application of my version", but stores a link to it in the store.  And that means it does not rise to me because of the old OS.  I check several more times, with vain hope of performing the same installation operation several times ... In vain ... I climb into google - yes, that is right: in principle, old versions can be downloaded from there, but up to 9th OS, and I have 5th!  ‚ÄúA piece of glass and aluminum,‚Äù ‚Äúbrick,‚Äù RIP, a dead man ... - spinning in my head ... - Fool, fool, why did you have to synchronize, something else to add.  Ah, the eternal perfectionism on the verge of pity.  They told you - it works, do not touch ... "And yet ... I do not give up.  We are not they ... We have no one to call.  I‚Äôm going to the ‚Äúupstor‚Äù - I can download it and (all of a sudden!) It will itself substitute the old version.  I click.  "You must confirm your billing details."  What kind of people?! .. I‚Äôm downloading the application I‚Äôve previously bought!  I tell them no.  "You must confirm your billing information" ... Tryndets.  Good.  I click OK.  Ad continues.  A new message: "You need to update the version of the OS on your computer, this version is outdated."  What?!  WHAT??!!!  Update ALL system on iMac ?!  Apple !!!  YOU what ???!  Aaaa morons !!!  Sleep, fatigue was gone. <br><br>  What to do.  I want to forget everything, quit like a bad dream.  But kids!  Children!  I remember that on the second disk, terrabaytnik, there might be some files of ‚Äúbykapy‚Äù left from the removed disk.  It seems copied music ... documents.  Work.  I climb.  For sure!  There is.  Entirely my old / home / user is my home folder!  Ta-a-a-ak ... This is already hope.  We are looking for where it stores backups.  I look at the way to save backups in iTunes: / User / Libraries / Application data / Mobile devices ... I climb into the old profile ... open: User ... Libraries ... Application data ... - folders with files appeared ... But, oh, disappointment!  Folders are only for letters A and B ... there are no other letters.  No, accordingly, no Mobile devices ... No !! .. This is all ... the end ... Sleep ... Calm down.  Score‚Ä¶ <br><br>  ... As if in oblivion doomedly I leave the investments I have passed ... higher, even higher ... that is, back ... I see the Music folder ... I click hopelessly ... I see the iTunes folder ... I click ... I see the Applications folder ... I click ... And ... No, I do not believe it!  Here they are relatives!  2011, ..12, ..14-ies files !!!  Tiny what.  30-50 megs on average.  Here they are ... my old applications ... all ... a list ... dear ... It used to store them here!  in music!!!  But will they get up ?!  Double-click: ‚ÄúDo you want to replace a newer application with an older version?‚Äù Oh, yes !!!  I want uy !!!  And how!  It seems to have risen ... now a terrible sync ... It has risen!  Booted !!!  There is!  I look at the iPad, click on AVPlayerHD .. - it works!  I call double ‚Äúfucked out‚Äù forever from the Stanza Apple Store.  There is!!!  She got up and she!  Glory to Jobs and the omnipresent doubleclick.  Glory to the good old "axes" of his baking and time.  After all, I'm still at 10.8, on "Mountain Lion" on the iMac - its last lifetime "axis."  The latter seems to be a normal working lap, which has been working together with iron for as many as 10 years.  And a piece of "glass and aluminum" came back to life.  He is with us again.  Our good old first ‚Äúipad‚Äù, unique and unique.  And again books and films will delight us!  And not only on the trip.  What a special connection has appeared with the reanimated patient, who was brought out of a coma, has risen!  Praise and pins and network stack!  Admin !!!  Long live perseverance and forgotten, but not erased backup. <br><br>  Such a story.  The history of the 1st (one) iPad.  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419227/</a></p>
