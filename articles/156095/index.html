Some are very interesting: one can literally walk through them in the national history of IT literally year after year. <br><br>  So, for example, the trendy "netbook" sample of 1992.  Please note that the laptop did not yet occupy a central place on the table: the papers remained just as important for several years.  There was no network, so the printer was attached to each computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc9/04a/d1d/bc904ad1d757a1b40df5a9be832e207b.jpg">

      <b>Caution, under the cut traffic</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But our laboratory for the development of new solutions in the same 1992.  This is actually much closer to the present than it seems: there were already mice, computers resembled the Lego designer, and not the ‚Äúyoung electrical engineer‚Äù set, although only those who proved their professional suitability were allowed to enter.  And, by the way, if there was a computer in the room - this is definitely not a typical office.  This will only become ordinary in five years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8d5/515/d10/8d5515d10a5c74efec08f1e47202dea9.jpg"><br><br>  Our commercial director "makes an onion," as we would say today.  All the most that neither is cool - earflap, fashionable "Volga", no extra gadgets ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/962/afc/5c2/962afc5c208a00862b84349111f50d13.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúMicrocircuits with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 1 square meter from the scientific research institute cannot be endured!‚Äù - this is the 95th year, then it was almost as cool to be photographed with such a piece of iron as with a spacecraft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c8/e9e/be4/4c8e9ebe4bae60c7ed065dc6e6d564d6.jpg"><br><br>  And this is 1996: if you present a color photograph, then, in principle, this can be seen somewhere in distant regions and today.  And if you close the right side of the photo with your hand, you can see something close in spirit to the 60th. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c08/24f/734/c0824f7344c8791aa3ffc6792fff6109.jpg"><br><br>  In the same year: this is a ‚Äúrun‚Äù, that is, testing computers after assembly.  Successfully assembling the system unit was quite simple, but there were still compatibility compatibility bugs for iron and just ‚Äúmoon phases‚Äù during production, so all the hardware was tested before being sent to the customer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d76/ac6/a39/d76ac6a3997d09a66a334f73edfd7bc8.jpg"><br><br>  The marketing department: even then we had so many ready-made projects that the racks were simply full of leaflets: this is the heyday of the IT industry in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e82/685/5f8/e826855f8fe718584b3ac7cb8ea85a0d.jpg"><br><br>  1997: our first "demo room" and its main frequenter of those years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/39a/14f/8ac/39a14f8ac235114df77f3a8edd700f23.jpg"><br><br>  Around this period, the train still drove into the building of our future <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/147474/">third data center</a> for unloading: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e7/a52/aeb/9e7a52aebe726882bb0c51ae036e5d3c.jpg"><br><br>  Two photos from the 98th year: it is almost modern by the standards of IT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/36e/de9/45f/36ede945f58763e9928e510f073e6229.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68a/e91/d8d/68ae91d8db09f50641bde4ba36f1ff27.jpg"><br><br>  2002 year: this is how the modern office looked.  IT people have already ceased to be perceived as bearded people in sweaters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99e/acc/fad/99eaccfad22bf14669743833d095d7bc.jpg"><br><br>  2003: testing and repair zone: ‚Äúdiseased‚Äù equipment was brought here, some of which had to be repaired with the help of a soldering iron and some kind of mother: modular components were not always enough in our country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/634/a36/37a/634a3637a13361b7af1c92aee3028442.jpg"><br><br>  This is how the server looked like in 2004.  Pay attention to the monitor, which was still needed by the server (in practice). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5d/79a/0c4/e5d79a0c442756d958d721284f163b12.jpg"><br><br>  Helpdesk in 2004: headsets were then associated with military and space films and were just beginning to come into use.  Monitors in the offices became flat and the photos became digital. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/90f/830/3f3/90f8303f3b1b47e5662e000b40f67c54.jpg"><br><br>  In 2006, they began to build a new office building: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ed/a22/600/0eda226007e7f4db696247599d4117d5.jpg"><br><br>  and in 2008, they finally moved to their own 11-storey office with a bunch of interesting "chips": energy-saving air conditioning and heating systems, automatic control of external lighting, automated building management and other things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1db/94a/ab1/1db94aab12e07567b3ecfbb910ad451e.jpg"><br><br>  By the year 2010, IT specialists finally disappear from the image of geeks: we support hobbies, creativity, and sports within the company.  Our experts take a couple of interesting achievements - for example, Elbrus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/950/d0b/f0e/950d0bf0eb6a0d71b25423a63b8dcb12.jpg"><br><br>  In 2012, we celebrated the twentieth anniversary and finally ‚Äúfinished off‚Äù the stereotype that an IT person is necessarily a man.  In the picture all - employees of the company. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/487/f30/799/487f30799a96e2ca117207fe9475a6d8.jpg"><br><br>  Actually, everything.  Almost all employees from photos today are people who have hundreds of successful IT projects behind their shoulders that would seem like real fantasy to people from 1992. <br><br>  In just a couple of decades, the world has changed right before their eyes, and even the processors of ordinary cameras and telephones have become hundreds of times faster than the computers running the orbiting satellites. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156095/</a></p>
