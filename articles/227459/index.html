  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian stage of the World Olympics Robots - we did it!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On June 21, a solemn opening ceremony of the Russian stage of the World Robot Olympiad (World Robot Olympiad - WRO) took place at the Kazan Tennis Academy. <br>  The Russian WRO stage was opened by Nikolai Nikiforov, Minister of Communications and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Livanov, Minister of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Rustam Minnikhanov, President of the Republic of Tatarstan, and Tespian, the most emotional android robot, who opened the international exhibition in Hannover with Angela Merkel and David Cameron. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d02/c4d/9f8/d02c4d9f8e1288d934c01ab0cf8bc417.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/839/bac/e91/839bace918d555f038fd25006d4adf24.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c4/662/7f7/2c46627f7b3d7d7768ebdc5995087693.jpg"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Klaus Ditlev Kristinsen, Secretary General of World Robot Olympiad, attended the competition in Kazan</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>‚ÄúThis is the fourth Russian stage of VRO, which I will witness.</i>  <i>And the first in Kazan.</i>  <i>In addition, this stage of the competition for the first time was organized by Innopolis University.</i>  <i>I am already looking forward to this event.</i>  <i>And, of course, it will be extremely interesting for me to see the outstanding Russian teams solving difficult problems within the framework of this year‚Äôs Olympiad.</i>  <i>One of the most exciting moments is to see with your own eyes how the participants will cope with them.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Worldwide teams participate in local and national stages.</i>  <i>The 2014 season has been going on since January, but now is the time when most of the competitions are held in the participating countries of VRO.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Tension and excitement intensify on the eve of VRO-2014 in Sochi.</i>  <i>The 2014 World Robot Olympiad will be a grand event with 400 teams from 50 countries.</i>  <i>I am very intrigued! ‚Äù</i> - Klaus Ditlev Kristinsen, Secretary General of World Robot Olympiad. </div></div><br>  58 cups were played in Kazan.  By analogy with the international stage of the WRO, young robotics from all over Russia competed in six categories - basic, creative, student, football, robots, sumo of robots and RoboTraffic. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A little more about the rules of the competition</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  For the main category, the task, depending on the age of the participant, is to assemble and program a robot, which will have to create a rocket and prepare it for launch, collecting space debris or replacing space station solar panels with non-working ones. <br>  Participants in the creative category are preparing a project on the themes ‚ÄúRobots and space‚Äù or ‚ÄúRobots and wildlife‚Äù.  To participate in the category of football, the team must prepare two independently operating robots: the attacker and the goalkeeper, who will fight with the enemy robots on a special field, using a special ball with infrared radiation.  In the sumo of robots, walking robots compete to push an opponent out of the ring. <br>  RoboTraffic is a robot race.  In this case, the robot must be able to determine the light of traffic lights on the track and arrive at the very first. </div></div><br>  The venue for the All-Russian WRO stage, the Kazan Academy of Tennis is one of the modern sports facilities of the 2013 Summer Universiade.  For all participants and team leaders, free accommodation in the Universiade Village residential district (150 meters from the competition venue) and free meals were organized. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/741/d9a/366/741d9a36601146ba996a2c2d90f760fa.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ff/aa6/8b8/2ffaa68b8677864c60c7e6b2164957b1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ef/b26/cf8/8efb26cf8d7553536aa2184c7830663e.jpg"><br>  This year, <b>720 robotics from 5 to 20 years old</b> participated in the competition - these are 373 teams from 42 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, as well as a team from Kazakhstan.  These are 638 boys and 62 girls.  For the first time in history, schoolchildren from the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol joined us. <br>  It was possible to make the competitions so massive and spectacular thanks to the efforts of the national operator WRO - Innopolis University - with the support of the Ministry of Education and Science, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan, the Russian Association of Educational Robotics and the Institute of New Technologies. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About the World Olympics Robots, which this year will be held in Russia for the first time</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Russia in 2014 will take the World Olympiad of robots for the first time.  The stadium for 8,000 spectators at Adler-Arena was chosen as the venue for the World Robot Olympiad, where speed skating competitions were held during the 2014 Winter Olympics. It is expected that representatives from 50 countries will take part in the competitions in Sochi.  The Organizing Committee of the World Olympiad of Robots is headed by Nikolai Nikiforov, Minister of Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation, and Dmitry Livanov, Minister of Education and Science of the Russian Federation. </div></div><br>  <i>‚ÄúInnopolis University received the right to be the national operator of World Robot Olympiad for the next five years, the next event we plan already in <a href="http://innopolis.ru/">Innopolis</a> - all the necessary infrastructure facilities will be ready</i> ,‚Äù Dmitry Kondratyev, director of Innopolis University. <br>  <b>In the team event of the Russian stage of the World Olympics, Robotov won the Chelyabinsk region, Moscow won second place, the Republic of Tatarstan took third place.</b>  <b>Results in individual categories for all age groups can be found <a href="http://wro2014.ru/res/">here.</a></b> <br>  The full photo report from the event is available <a href="http://wro2014.ru/">here.</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f4/db2/9f1/8f4db29f14221e74d08d9dc91b4b8953.jpg"></div>
