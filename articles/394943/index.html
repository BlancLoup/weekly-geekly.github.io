Tens of millions of users, 1,563 training courses from 140 universities from 28 countries (as of January 2016).  By the way, the most popular of all one and a half thousand courses in <i>all languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world</i> , according to Coursera statistics, is the course in Russian ‚Äú <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/robots-arduino">We build robots and other devices on the Arduino.</a>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/robots-arduino">From a traffic light to a 3D printer</a> . ‚Äù  The course is taught by teachers from the laboratory of innovative educational technologies of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology: Alexey Perepelkin, head of the robotics department, and Dmitry Savitsky, researcher.  Even this fact shows how popular the Coursera is with the Russian audience.

The best training programs in the most relevant subjects - lectures, practical exercises, online check, support for mobile applications for the iPhone and Android ... What else can a resident of some Russian backwoods, for whom online education in programming, robotics, <a href="https://toster.ru/q/297811">machine learning</a> , artificial intelligence - the only hope is to somehow improve your life in the future.  What can I say, many people <i>have already</i> changed their lives thanks to Coursera.  But all good things end sooner or later. <br><br>  Unfortunately, even on the Sun there are spots.  With regret we have to admit that our beloved ‚ÄúCurser‚Äù in recent years has <a href="http://reachtarunhere.github.io/2016/06/11/Golden-Age-of-MOOCs-is-over-and-why-I-hate-Coursera/">become increasingly greedy</a> , almost like Udacity. <br><br>  Like some other projects that have declared ‚Äúaccessible accessible education for all the inhabitants of the Earth,‚Äù Coursera is also gradually commercializing.  Like Udacity, in Coursera, money gradually becomes a top priority, and for this the company sacrifices the interests of its users.  Of course, this is a private project (unlike <a href="https://www.edx.org/about-us">edX</a> ), the company has the full right to earn money and use different business models, but given such a development vector, it will be some hypocrisy to say that the company "provides universal access to the world's best education" .  Previously, they declared universal access to ‚Äúfree education‚Äù (‚Äúis free of charge‚Äù), but now the word ‚Äúfree‚Äù has been <a href="https://www.coursera.org/about/">carefully removed from all pages of the site</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/074/003/5d9/0740035d9e8d4930bb47f0812c9916a5.jpg"><br>  <i><sup>Old screenshot</sup></i> <br><br>  For Coursera, the business model at the first stage envisaged a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3000042/how-coursera-free-online-education-service-will-school-us-all">massive involvement of users</a> with further commercialization.  In principle, there is nothing surprising in this; according to this cynical business model, many Internet companies operate that offer free services to users. <br><br>  Having received an audience of tens of millions of people, Coursera began to gradually tighten the screws. <br><br>  It all started with the fact that Coursera, like everyone else, refused to issue free certificates.  Only paid remained.  It is clear that they are beautiful - they are sent in paper form, with stamps, etc.  But for many, it was enough to have a free certificate in digital form and a pdf file (amendment 06/13/2016: apparently, paper certificates are no longer being sent, now digital certificates have become paid). <br><br>  Well, no big deal, many thought.  What is the difference, whether they give a free certificate in digital form or not, because the main thing is knowledge, curriculum, which remained here of the highest quality. <br><br>  Then they turned off free access to questionnaires and assignments.  It was already strange.  Everyone knows that completing assignments is an important part of the learning process.  How to study algorithms, if you do not check the knowledge gained in real problems?  In the end, the job still remained available, but it was impossible to send and check the answer.  Well, this is at least something, it could be worse, many thought. <br><br>  And now Coursera has undertaken another (last?) Reform - they generally remove all courses from the old platform!  This decision caused a natural outrage among some users. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe golden era of mass open online education is coming to an end,‚Äù <a href="http://reachtarunhere.github.io/2016/06/11/Golden-Age-of-MOOCs-is-over-and-why-I-hate-Coursera/">said</a> one of the past students of Coursera, an Indian student Tarun Wangani (Tarun Vangani), who studies programming. <br><br>  The problem is that on the new platform, not all courses available on the old one are available.  ‚ÄúOn the old platform, the courses contain practical tasks - it seems that this material [of the Coursera] is troubling,‚Äù writes Tarun Wangani.  He states that as a result of this decision, a huge amount of material from public use will disappear, both on forums and in problem books. <br><br>  "And they were obviously very generous, sending out e-mails with a reminder to back up our data so that they would not be lost."  For this Coursera recommends such a wonderful method: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fd/100/de0/3fd100de0c7b4a1388e509639ec619b1.png"><br><br><blockquote>  To save course materials from the old platform: <br><br><ul><li>  Download all lecture slides or videos that you would like to keep for reference. </li><li>  Keep a record of your answers to questions and other assignments by <b>taking screenshots</b> . </li></ul></blockquote><br>  Screenshots?

For clarification: now Coursera does not always require payment for solving problems on free courses on a new platform.  Some courses are still completely free, along with tasks, you only need to pay for the certificate.
