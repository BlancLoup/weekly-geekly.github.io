Perhaps our experience will be useful to those who face a similar problem. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Chronicle </h4><h5>  09.11.2012 Friday: </h5>  <b>14-30</b> <br>  A provider from the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">city ‚Äã‚Äãof Kovrov</a> called and our IT department asked in a friendly way: ‚ÄúHow can you block something?‚Äù  After all, if we block by IP, then a number of projects will fall. ‚Äù  Thanks to this, we learned that, firstly, one of the pages of our resource is blacklisted.  And, secondly, they immediately found out what caused the blocking.  This is due to the archives of the 2004 ‚ÄúCountry of the Games‚Äù forum entitled ‚ÄúHow to kill yourself at home‚Äù: <br>  <a href="http://forum.gameland.ru/m_175913/mpage_2/tm.htm">forum.gameland.ru/m_175913/mpage_2/tm.htm</a> , where forum users are really joking and not much discussed this issue.  The page is easily located in search engine caches (by the way, what is not a reason for blocking them?) <br><br>  <b>14-35</b> <br>  Open the notorious <a href="http://zapret-info.gov.ru/">zapret-info.gov.ru</a> and get the answer that the specified URL is indeed in the registry of banned sites by decision of the Rospotrebnadzor and is number 18. I note that if you just enter <a href="http://forum.gameland.ru/">forum.gameland.ru</a> , the system will <a href="http://forum.gameland.ru/">produce</a> a negative result.  Thus, without a hint of good guys from the city of Kovrov (or later the XML file with the list of prohibited sites leaked to the Network), we would probably still be at the stage of finding out the reasons for blocking.

      <b>14-45</b> <br>  Remove the ill-fated branch from the forum. <br><br>  <b>15-00</b> <br>  Head of the project ‚ÄúAll movies.  Total DVD "writes that it does not open the forum of the forum forum.totaldvd.ru magazine and covers the screenshot of the Beeline stub" The resource is blocked by the decision of the state authorities. "  This was how not one resource was blocked at once, but several at once ‚Äî all that were hosted on the same IP. <br><br>  <b>15-33</b> <br>  We are trying to reach Roskomnadzor.  The general number of the reference and information center indicated on the <a href="http://www.rsoc.ru/">main page of the department is</a> not responding.  In the section "Contacts" we found several more numbers - if I am not mistaken, the lawyer was answered by calling the department of control and supervision in the sphere of mass communications.  We listened to the problem and said something like the following: ‚ÄúThe removal procedure is not completely debugged, but if the illegal content is deleted, you can write them in free form by email.‚Äù  They promised to take the necessary actions within 3-5 days. <br><br>  <b>15-45</b> <br>  We send to the addresses rsoc_in@rsoc.ru and zapret-info@rsoc.ru a semi-official letter drawn up by a lawyer on behalf of the company (but not signed with an electronic key), stating the details of the problem.  Short: <br>  - the resource has been locked; <br>  - due to blocking by IP, a number of resources that do not work at all do not work; <br>  - received no notifications and instructions and could not influence the situation; <br>  - content that is in doubt removed. <br>  - Please remove the URL of the blocked page and our IP address from the registry. <br><br>  <b>15-50</b> <br>  We leave the ticket to the hoster with a request to explain why we were not notified of the receipt of the prescription by Roskomnadzor. <br><br>  <b>16-00</b> <br>  We change the IP-address resources, realizing that the chances of a quick response, especially on the eve of the weekend, are very small. <br><br><h5>  Saturday and Sunday: </h5>  We have no changes.  We read about Lurk. <br><br><h5>  12.11.2012 Monday </h5>  We have no changes <br><br><h5>  13.11.  2012 Tuesday </h5><ul><li>  We read about unlocking Lurka. </li><li>  <b>Check the registry - the blocked URL and IP-address in it no longer appears.</b> </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Current state: </h4><ul><li>  Resource is not locked </li><li>  No response from Roskomnadzor via email, but there is a result (fortunately, not vice versa) </li><li>  Ticket from the hoster remains open. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Brief conclusions: </h4><ol><li>  Notification processes are not debugged.  It is not clear how Roskomnadzor informs hosters (hosters, please write).  It is not clear how hosters should promptly inform the owners of resources. </li><li>  There is extremely little time allocated for deleting pages that are recognized as dangerous (especially taking into account item 1).  Most likely, you will learn about blocking as a fait accompli. </li><li>  Blocking by IP-address is an extremely doubtful initiative, because it entails blocking innocent, legitimate resources.  This was obviously and naturally criticized during the discussion of the law.  Our example is proof of this. </li><li>  Finding the reasons for blocking can take a lot of time.  If the notification does not come to you and the list of blocked sites does not leak to the Network, then you probably won‚Äôt know: which page turned out to be ‚Äúguilty‚Äù (the search on zapret-info.gov.ru does not support masks - you need to specify the exact and full URL for checking) and is your resource at all guilty (and not any other resource running on this IP). </li><li>  Roskomnadzor really responds to emails sent to them by email, and in case of deletion of content illegal from its point of view, removes the blocking. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>Update</b> <br><h5>  11/30/2012 </h5><br>  RosKomNadzor received a reply to an email with a notification of exclusion from the list of banned sites due to the deletion of information prohibited for deletion. <br><br>  Subscribe to "Hacker" <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://bit.ly/habr_subscribe_paper">1 999 .</a>  <a href="http://bit.ly/habr_subscribe_paper">for 12 numbers of paper version</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://bit.ly/digital_xakep">1249r.</a>  <a href="http://bit.ly/digital_xakep">for an annual subscription to iOS / iPad (Android'a release soon!)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://bit.ly/habr_android">"Hacker" on Android</a> </li></ul><br><br> <a href="http://bit.ly/xakep_on_ipad"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a86/fc6/a22/a86fc6a22179b180d53a36f9cb5a7d3f.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158515/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158515/</a></p>
