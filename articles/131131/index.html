  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Aspia 0.2.5</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5b38cc97/386dbe9b/cbc3d431/7ba5a751.jpg" align="left"></a>  After long months of development, I can submit to the public a new version of the program for collecting information about the computer for Windows OS - Aspia 0.2.5.  The release date was repeatedly shifted in order to complete all the planned features, but I could not pull further with the exit.  Due to the lack of iron for testing, I was unable to make support for reading SPD data for DDR3 and getting temperatures from AMD processors.  However, despite all these difficulties, the release was worthy. <br><br>  What new was implemented? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The amount of useful information that Aspia can receive has somewhat expanded.  Now users can access the following new categories of information: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      ‚Ä¢ In DMI (SMBIOS) data, you now have the opportunity to see information about embedded devices and batteries.  This entire section has also been updated to reflect the latest version of the SMBIOS specification. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Information about connected monitors (EDID) <br>  ‚Ä¢ File Types Registered in the System <br>  ‚Ä¢ Information about the prohibitions (for example, whether the Task Manager or the Registry Editor is disabled in the registry) <br>  ‚Ä¢ System files (known DLLs, a complete list of all DLL, AX, EXE and SYS files in the system with the size, version, manufacturer and description) <br><br>  Improved and some previously existing categories.  For example, ‚ÄúRegional Settings‚Äù now displays information about the encodings that are used in the system. <br><br>  In the previous version of Aspia, the ability to detect unknown devices (for which drivers have not yet been installed) was added.  The device database was decided to use its own.  In version 0.2.5, this feature has been continued.  Now when you first start the program, it is proposed to send a report on unknown devices (you can refuse to send a report, for this there is a corresponding check mark in the parameters). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d97bd7ad/2d429a52/26445968/2e457082.jpg"></div><br><br>  Do not be afraid to do this, the report contains only data on devices.  For example, for PCI devices, strings containing the manufacturer's ID, device ID and device name from the system will be sent.  Data is transferred to the server and entered into the database.  Thus, it is planned to increase the base of devices. <br>  The program parameters dialog has been completely redesigned.  Added some functionality. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2c71f981/7480d53b/26daff1f/1070a3fa.jpg"></div><br><br>  I am sure that many will like the ability to filter data.  So far, only filters of system events and Internet Explorer history are available. <br>  When you save a report, the file format selection appears.  Previously, only an HTML report was available, and now you can also choose between CSV, INI, RTF and regular text files. <br>  Aspia, starting with version 0.2.5, will be delivered in the form of a version requiring installation and a Portable version.  All program components are digitally signed by the ReactOS Foundation. <br>  In addition to all these changes, there are many corrections of various errors, but I am sure that not all have been corrected, but it is possible that some have been added.  Without this, nowhere.  The program was tested using PVS-Studio, a ‚Äútemporary‚Äù license for which I was kindly provided, as well as Cppcheck, but I did not find any serious errors. <br><br><h4>  What is planned in the next version? </h4><br><br>  Plans, as always ambitious, I will try to implement at least some of them. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Divide the program into a library for information and GUI. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Make output information in XML and JSON. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Add full support for getting AMD processor temperatures <br>  ‚Ä¢ Implement data acquisition SPD for DDR3 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Obtaining information about temperatures, rotational speeds of coolers and voltages from motherboard sensors (almost all the code for this is already written) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Getting information about the temperatures of video cards <br>  ‚Ä¢ Implementation of the system monitor (something like the Open Hardware Monitor, but inside Aspia) with the ability to observe the current, maximum and minimum values ‚Äã‚Äãof all values. <br>  ‚Ä¢ A set of performance tests for hard drives, optical disks, RAM, CPU and GPU <br>  ‚Ä¢ Stress tests for equipment <br>  ‚Ä¢ Getting information about CD / DVD drives <br><br><h4>  Aspia Network Version </h4><br>  I was repeatedly offered to make a network version of the program.  The point is that Aspia will be divided into 2 parts: a library that will receive information and a graphical interface.  After this separation, it will be possible to do 2 things: write a service that will use the library for receiving information and communicate with the server, as well as make a GUI using, for example, Qt. <br>  The server part (it is best to write in PHP) will collect information from a number of computers, for example, in an organization, and store it for a certain period in a database.  Through a web interface, the network administrator will be able to monitor the operation of all computers in the organization, track changes in parameters, installed programs, temperatures, autoload, and others. <br>  The Qt interface will allow you to make a version for Linux, but for this you will need to write a version of the Linux information library. <br>  Thus, we will be able to get a cross-platform program for obtaining information, both on separate local computers, and centralized network. <br>  Similar systems exist, but they cost a fair amount of money.  I haven't seen anything like open source yet (maybe I was looking badly).  It would be very interesting to implement all this under an open source license. <br>  If you are interested, read the following paragraph. <br><br><h4>  You can participate in the development of Aspia </h4><br>  I'd love to see new developers in the Aspia project.  If you can write documentation, know English (or any other languages), know how to write programs in C or work with a program site or something else to help, then you are welcome.  For a long time the project has its own SVN-server and a bug-tracker on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/aspia/">Google Code</a> . <br>  You can test Aspia and post bug reports in the bug tracker. <br>  You can also help by providing the necessary equipment for testing.  Currently required computers with AMD processors and computers with motherboards that have a chipset from Intel with installed DDR3 RAM.  These computers must have Windows installed (from 2000 to 2008 R2) and have remote access to them via RDP, Radmin, VNC or any remote control program. <br>  If you are in Chelyabinsk, then you have the opportunity to give the iron in my temporary use for some time to implement its support. <br>  I can also accept as a gift any working hardware (motherboards, video cards, etc.). <br>  The conditions for new developers are very simple: you contact me, tell me what you would like to do, make patches that implement something or fix bugs.  If you send several adequate patches in a row, you get write access to the SVN repository.  No despotic demands to anyone I have, I will listen to any suggestions about the current code, solutions and other things. <br>  If you can not help your work, then there is an opportunity to <a href="http://aspia.ru/donate">support the project financially</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://aspia.ru/downloads">Download Aspia 0.2.5</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131131/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131131/</a></p>
