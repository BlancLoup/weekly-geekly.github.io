The solution was designed by Portuguese architect Microsoft Jorge Miguel Ferreira, deployed by Microsoft and Infobox experts in Hyper-V, System Center and Azure, certified by Microsoft as part of the Cloud OS Network Russia program.  After deployment, the cloud passed a large-scale nine-month test and is already used by dozens of large customers in production.  The real uptime of virtual machines in the cloud was 100% (according to independent monitoring by UptimeRobot, which checks the availability of virtual machines every minute from 24x points in different parts of the world). <br><br> <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6d/757/b0f/b6d757b0fab28e5b8ca0c7454e1a4920.png" title="Azure Pack Infrastructure" alt="Azure Pack Infrastructure" width="800"></a> <br><br>  This platform is designed for customers implementing business-critical projects in the clouds, which should work 24x7x365 no matter what.  The platform is designed for corporate customers implementing long-term projects in the cloud.  Current functionality will be maintained in the Infobox for at least the next decade.  Everything in this cloud is focused around stability and availability. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Microsoft joint project and Infobox </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbd/661/cca/bbd661cca3f12cc251192a00d51ed92c.png" width="200" align="left">  We started developing the Azure Pack Infrastructure back in 2015 due to the emergence of a law requiring the storage of personal data in Russia and numerous requests from corporate users who wanted to have a single, compatible infrastructure in offices, server rooms, in a reliable data center in Russia and in the global cloud .  Microsoft at the same time began to actively develop the Cloud OS Network Russia program for creating certified local cloud solutions for clients.  Infobox went through a difficult selection process to the program, proving its expertise and the ability to implement the project qualitatively.

      By combining Microsoft's experience in creating global high-available cloud services and local expertise and understanding the needs of Russian Infobox customers, as well as working closely with large customers to create an installation, we were able to implement the optimal solution for corporate clients.  We focused on a single task: the cloud should work like a Swiss watch, this is most important for corporate clients.  Our specialists worked together with Microsoft for months on designing a solution, learning from Microsoft‚Äôs experience in deploying and supporting mission-critical projects. <br><br><h3>  Certified equipment and data center </h3><br>  To deploy the solution, Huawei equipment certified by Microsoft and previously proven in the Microsoft Private Cloud Fast Track program was used.  Huawei also guarantees the supply of components, regardless of the political situation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/493/6b2/21e/4936b221ef99e2b470e5b439c3e89395.png" width="800"><br><br>  The installation was placed by the Dataspace data center certified by the Uptime Institute for Tier III Design, Tier III Facility, Tier III Operation sustainability international standards of the Uptime Institute international organization.  The data center complies with international standards of reliability and fault tolerance, which guarantees the reliability and continuity of our clients' business processes.  DataSpace guarantees 100% availability of hardware, applications and data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd5/ece/dd2/fd5ecedd2769bcf5b2f385ef9a12aeaf.jpg" width="200"><br><br><h3>  Installation Deployment and Evaluation </h3><br>  The solution was deployed with experts from Microsoft Consulting Services according to all Microsoft requirements for high availability and security.  After deployment, during certification, the reliability of the installation was tested: various components of the installation were suddenly shut down and the performance of the deployed solutions of real customers was checked (real high availability availability).  To certify breaks in the work should not arise.  Logs and correctness of software operation and configuration were also analyzed. <br><br>  The tests were successfully passed and Microsoft allowed to provide the service in a commercial mode in February 2016.  Since then, the service has been operated in production mode for a closed circle of business customers.  We were convinced that the service really meets the quality requirements in actual operation. <br><br>  We guarantee the availability of virtual machines for the service of 99.982% per year (downtime is guaranteed in total not more than 96 minutes per year).  This is documented in the <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/upload/iblock/81e/sla_customer-wap_20160701.pdf">official SLA document</a> . <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThe InfoboxCloud Azure Pack Infrastructure cloud service, created jointly by Infobox experts and Microsoft architects from Europe, sets a new bar for high-quality corporate IaaS services.</em>  <em>It brings together Microsoft's global expertise in cloud services for businesses with many years of experience of Infobox in the hosting market in Russia.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Choosing Azure Pack Infrastructure, our customers will be able to get high-quality IaaS service, which has all the characteristics of a modern ‚Äúcloud‚Äù at a very competitive price and high quality of service.</em>  <em>And all this is on the servers on the territory of the Russian Federation, completely in Russian. "</em> <br>  <em>Kirill Kotlyarenko, Strategic Cloud Service Development Manager, Microsoft Russia</em> <br><br><h3>  Microsoft Premium Support </h3><br>  Experienced certified engineers who support the installation are good, but not enough.  We allowed the possibility of not only the failure of equipment, but also software, and were protected from it.  For the service, Microsoft's premium support was purchased, ensuring that problems are resolved as quickly as possible, even if they are in the Microsoft software products themselves: Windows Server, SQL Server, System Center, Azure Pack and others used in the installation.  If a problem is detected and there is no ready solution, the necessary patch is developed for the product specifically for us and deployed to the installation.  During the deployment, we had to contact premium support for patching and all known problems were resolved. <br><br><h3>  Infobox Expert Support </h3><br>  User support is provided 24x7x365.  The support includes not only direct support for the product, but also advice on choosing the best (for the customer!) Solution in InfoboxCloud, assistance in developing a solution architecture, migration assistance, advice on other issues that usually remain beyond the support.  When working, we are guided by the principle ‚ÄúThink about your business, we will do the rest‚Äù and try to make this approach a reality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4dd/ab5/581/4ddab5581168ac98f75cd5d57e4308c4.png" width="200" align="left">  The company has an expert responsible for the happiness of users when using our products.  It connects to many decision-making processes and directly configuring solutions, from product planning to operation, and always protects and defends the interests of users (no ‚Äúoptimizations‚Äù in product quality, pricing or support will be passed or accepted).  Thus, users have their own lawyer in the company ( <a href="">write a letter</a> ). <br><br>  We are always open to feedback on the quality of our work.  You can always write <a href="">us a review</a> , which will be received by all heads of all departments, including the CEO. <br><br><h3>  Clouds are not the same. </h3><br>  In the process of setting up, we had plenty of opportunities to make the lowest prices on the market, optimizing the settings of the overcommit - the ability to sell more resources than we really have in the installation, but we did not do that.  The task of the Azure Pack Infrastructure is to efficiently solve the tasks of customers in mission-critical projects, and this can be done only by ensuring resources. <br><br>  As in our other services, we have provided adequate and affordable prices for a service of this level.  We earn on the scale, rather than on a specific user, the cost of the solution for the client does not add paid mandatory additional services (for example, when the cost of the solution‚Äôs resources is calculated for the client, and later it‚Äôs reported that you need to pay for the Internet channel separately, for basic support - separately, for traffic - separately).  <strong>Our tariffs in Azure Pack Infrastructure always have a fixed cost per month, which is optimal for Russian accounting.</strong>  <strong>Overwrite in this cloud is impossible.</strong> <br><br><h3>  How much is? </h3><br>  A tariff is a collection of resources of your virtual data center from which you can create the necessary number of virtual machines (for example, several large or many small ones, if the amount of resources in the tariff allows of course).  If necessary, you can add additional resources without switching to the senior tariff plan. <br><br>  The list of pricing plans with prices is available in the <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/about/docs/">official InfoboxCloud documents section</a> . <br><br>  Tariffs of group <strong>D</strong> (Datacenter) and group <strong>DR</strong> (Datacenter Ram Optimized) are intended for industrial use. <br><br>  We understand that this cloud can be used not only by corporate customers, but also by developers or owners of sites for which high availability is critical, so we introduced a special group of tariffs <strong>Dev</strong> , which made tariffs with a smaller amount of included resources sufficient for work: <strong>from 1509 rubles per month</strong> .  With an advance payment for half a year, a 5% discount is given, with an advance payment for a year - 10%.  Discount is not a marketing solution.  With an advance payment, we can put money into circulation and get a difference - this is good for us and for customers. <br><br>  <strong>If you do not find a suitable tariff for yourself, we will create a personal one for you</strong> , based on the single reasonable cost of installation resources.  There are very few restrictions for this: the amount of memory in the tariff must be 2 GB or more and the amount of memory in the tariff must be equal to or greater than the amount of CPU.  This is necessary to ensure optimal loading of the installation (otherwise it would have to make prices higher).  For you to create a personal rate - just <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/">fill in the form</a> on the main page of our site. <br><br><h3>  Opportunities </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93a/610/21e/93a61021ee3f7df997943fffe24a9da5.jpg" width="300" align="left">  Cloud Azure Pack Infrastructure allows you to create a smoothly running IT infrastructure for the customer, consisting of virtual machines of suitable size and virtual networks. <br><br>  <strong>The maximum available cloud server size is 48 virtual cores, 256 GB of RAM and up to 64 terabytes of disk space.</strong> <br><br>  Available operating systems: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚Ä¢ Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter with GUI EN <br>  ‚Ä¢ Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter with GUI RU <br>  ‚Ä¢ Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter Core EN <br>  ‚Ä¢ Windows Server 2012 Datacenter with GUI EN <br>  ‚Ä¢ Windows Server 2012 Datacenter with GUI RU <br>  ‚Ä¢ Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter with GUI EN <br>  ‚Ä¢ Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter with GUI RU <br>  ‚Ä¢ Debian Server 8 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Debian Server 7 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS <br>  ‚Ä¢ CentOS Server 7 <br>  ‚Ä¢ CentOS Server 6 </blockquote><br>  If necessary, we can create an additional OS image required for your task.  The list of available operating systems is constantly updated. <br><br>  <strong>Windows Server 2016</strong> has already been tested and will be available immediately after release. <br><br>  You can create the required number of public (with access to the Internet) and private isolated virtual networks and connect servers to them.  NAT is used in public networks - in the network settings you can define rules for port forwarding, including for the same IP address you can forward different ports to different servers.  You can also switch an external IP address from one server to another using forwarding rules. <br><br>  Users can not only connect to servers by assigning an external address, but also connect to the server console from the control panel. <br><br>  For secure connection of cloud networks to the customer's IT infrastructure, <strong>Site-To-Site VPN is used</strong> .  On the customer side, there should be a white IP software or hardware VPN server running on IPSec IKEv2.  On the cloud side, a Site-To-Site VPN is created for the network and the data for accessing the VPN server is specified.  Thus, a secure communication channel is established between the customer‚Äôs infrastructure and the cloud. <br><br>  If you have previously worked with the classic Microsoft Azure Management Portal, the control panel will be familiar to you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e27/808/3c0/e278083c059b9001336131da3a5bb36b.jpg" width="800"><br><br>  API is available for software cloud management. <br><br>  For more information about the capabilities of the platform, you can learn from the <a href="https://support.infobox.ru/azurepi/azure_pack_infrastructure_user_guide.pdf">constantly growing documentation</a> .  In the following articles we will look at the platform‚Äôs capabilities in more detail, and <strong>right now for any questions you can write to the expert on the chat site <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/">https://infoboxcloud.ru</a> and be sure to get an answer</strong> . <br><br><h3>  Testing and demonstration </h3><br>  By filling out the form on the main page <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/">https://infoboxcloud.ru</a> you can get free access to the Azure Pack Infrastructure for testing and get a calculation of the placement of the required number of servers in the cloud.  The duration of the test period is determined by the real need for your task.  If necessary, we can help you choose the right solution for your project and conduct personal demonstrations of the platform's capabilities and training for your employees. <br><br><h3>  InfoboxCloud - hybrid cloud! </h3><br>  In InfoboxCloud, you are not limited only by the capabilities, features and price of the Azure Pack Infrastructure!  From a single provider, you can access the high-performance <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/services/virtuozzo/">Virtuozzo Infrastructure</a> cloud and a global cloud that has more than 30 <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/services/azure/">Microsoft Azure</a> data centers (at prices no higher than Microsoft, but with expert support from Infobox and convenient payment and reporting through Infobox).  For specific tasks, we offer the construction of a dedicated cloud infrastructure, which will be deployed entirely for the customer, taking into account all the requirements and wishes.  If necessary, all cloud platforms can be combined into a single network and connected via secure VPN channels to the customer's own infrastructure.  Thus, the customer‚Äôs infrastructure can be expanded using both local clouds of different levels of availability and price, in different regions (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Amsterdam and Krasnoyarsk) and global clouds, IaaS infrastructure services, as well as ready-made solutions can be used PaaS. <br><br> <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/680/e37/762/680e3776239b9569303d73931ddd68a4.jpg" width="800"></a> <br>  Waiting for you.
