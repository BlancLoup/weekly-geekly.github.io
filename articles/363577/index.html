This is much more than most inventors get in their lives.  For example, one of the recently issued patents is on the design of the Apple glass cube on Fifth Avenue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce4/096/dfe/ce4096dfe7b645b3a7b00185d769d099.jpg"><br><br>  Here is an illustration from the corresponding <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/D712067.html">patent</a> .

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51e/dc9/ab4/51edc9ab432e43faa757f28825961889.png"><br><br>  Since Jobs was involved in the development of many Apple products, he was often included as a collaborator.  About 300 patent applications named Jobs are still in the process of being filed with the US Patent Office.  Moreover, new ones are still being served. <br><br>  In addition, Apple traditionally tries to patent absolutely all the nuances of its products, down to the smallest ones, Jobs himself encouraged this practice, <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/532841/steve-jobs-lives-on-at-the-patent-office/">writes</a> Technology Review. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In hundreds of Jobs patents lies the entire history of Apple.  The very first was issued on April 12, 1983 for an invention that was simply called: <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/USD268584">‚Äúpersonal computer‚Äù</a> (patent No. 268,584). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35f/fb5/69e/35ffb569e1364b6491e27bff25ebd605.jpg"><br><br>  Fans of Apple technology sometimes say with regret that the company <a href="http://www.yukarikane.com/haunted-empire-book/">will not survive after Steve Jobs</a> .  The current executive director, Tim Cook, is a pragmatic logistics specialist who has optimized supplies of equipment from Chinese factories.  His name is not in any patent. <br><br>  However, reality refutes the forecasts of pessimists.  In the past three years, the company continued to develop new products (watches, payment system), and its financial indicators are growing, as before.  With Cook, Apple‚Äôs annual revenue more than doubled to $ 182 billion. <br><br>  On the other hand, too little time has passed.  Perhaps Apple is still moving by inertia, largely using the work of previous years and the course followed by its founding father.  The fact that Steve Jobs still remains the main inventor in the world in terms of the number of patents granted can serve as confirmation of this fact. <br><br>  Although Jobs was posthumously introduced into the National Hall of Fame of US Inventors in 2012, some experts do not consider his inventions (as the appearance of the iPhone) to be an outstanding, but only a small technical improvement.  In addition, he was often included among the co-authors for completely insignificant useful comments, as was the case with the QuickTime interface and the iPod, created by Tim Vasco. <br><br>  Interestingly, the name of Steve Jobs among the co-authors of the patent is sometimes used even in lawsuits.  So, in a 2012 trial against Motorola, a Chicago judge specifically appealed to Apple‚Äôs lawyers to stop calling the key patent on svayp and scrolling on the touchscreen ‚ÄúSteve Jobs patent‚Äù.  According to the judge, lawyers tried to exploit the name of the popularly beloved founder of Apple, while he was only one of 25 co-authors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363577/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363577/</a></p>
