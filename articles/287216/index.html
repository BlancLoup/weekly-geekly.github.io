  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WikiLeaks has published another batch of revealing secret documents</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Oglaske betrayed more than 250 thousand letters to US diplomats.  Correspondence includes data on the US foreign policy strategy for many countries, corruption, and a description of world leaders, including Russian.  The main part of the documents dates from 2006 to February 2010. <br><br>  Judging by the publications, American diplomats in their reports to Washington called the President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev the political hostage of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.  President Medvedev is described by them as ‚ÄúRobin‚Äù in relation to ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù -Putin (meaning the film ‚ÄúBatman and Robin‚Äù from the series about a flying superhero).  In this film, a man who is a bat, previously acting alone, takes on his companions younger and less experienced comrade Robin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  World leaders in the declassified documents are given unflattering characteristics.  President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia, as follows from the cover of Der Spiegel‚Äôs November 29 issue, which was at the disposal of journalists before being put on the market, is mentioned in the letters with adjectives ‚Äúfaded‚Äù and ‚Äúindecisive‚Äù.  Afghan President Hamid Karzai is described as "prone to paranoia," and German leader Angela Merkel allegedly "avoids risks and rarely shows a creative approach."  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is compared with Adolf Hitler.

      Ispasnkaya El Pais pays attention to the characterization of Vladimir Putin.  The chairman of the Russian government is called the "leader of the pack" (in the original - alpha-dog, which many Russian media translated as "alpha male") and a politician who adheres to authoritarian methods, whose personal leadership style allows you to compare it with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. <br><br>  Putin‚Äôs ‚Äúextremely close relationship‚Äù with Berlusconi, which US diplomats are concerned about, is pointed out by The New York Times.  Their manifestations are "generous gifts", lucrative energy contracts, as well as a kind of "shadow" mediator from Russian-speaking Italians.  In 2009, diplomats noted that Silvio Berlusconi "is increasingly becoming a conduit for Putin‚Äôs interests in Europe." <br><br>  Statements by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev on the top Russian leadership were also made public.  The materials declassified by WikiLeaks state: Aliyev believes that Russian President Dmitry Medvedev actually "does not control" his surroundings. <br><br>  Judging by the publications, the Azerbaijani leader said that he ‚Äúsaw for himself‚Äù - the decisions taken by the Russian president require further approval.  Ilham Aliyev suggests that this approval must be obtained "in the office of the Prime Minister."  ‚ÄúMany high-ranking officials do not recognize Dmitry Medvedev as a leader,‚Äù said the President of Azerbaijan.  At the same time, he himself considers the head of the Russian state ‚Äúan intellectual of a new generation‚Äù. <br><br>  The materials also refer to the existing confrontation between the teams of the president and the prime minister of the Russian Federation, which, however, has not yet been observed between the members of the Kremlin ‚Äútandem‚Äù themselves. <br><br>  As the Guardian newspaper found out from the letters that were transmitted, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs leaders secretly asked the US authorities to carry out an air strike on Iran, and American diplomats were allegedly entrusted with monitoring the UN leadership. <br><br>  Among other data that may cause a wide resonance in the world are US plans to create a single state on the Korean Peninsula after the fall of the DPRK and details about the sponsors of the Al Qaeda terrorist organization from Saudi Arabia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287216/</a></p>
