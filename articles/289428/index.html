      So did Ryan Holiday, the author of the successfully sold book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591846358/">‚ÄúObstacle is the best way‚Äù</a> (simply the greatest book) and easy to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591846285/">‚ÄúBelieve me, I lie: recognition of media manipulators‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  He is also the founder of Brass Check Marketing and somehow finds time to give monthly tips on books to 30,000 people. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLike all people, I like to think that I am a productive person,‚Äù said Ryan.  "And if so, it is only due to one thing - the desire to draw knowledge and secrets from smarter and more successful people." <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn my entire career, I was fortunate enough to mend relations with many famous authors, successful entrepreneurs, investors, managers and creative people.  With some I could not meet in person, but I got their thoughts from the books.  Whether they know it or not, I took from their methods only the most important, in my opinion, ideas that can <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-urokov-o-tom-kak-povysit-produktivnost-kotorye-ya-usvoil-rabotaya-po-90-chasov-v-nedelyu-tselyy-mesjac/">maximize productivity</a> . ‚Äù <br><br>  Here are the secrets of productivity that Rain borrowed and wants to share with the others: <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Brian "Birdman" Williams</font> </h2><br>  Birdman founded the world famous label Cash Money Records, which earned him about 500 million dollars.  When I first met him in the studio at one in the morning from Saturday to Sunday, I was shocked to the depths of my soul, having learned that his working day is just beginning.  He works at night and is resting during the day. <br><br>  At first, as already mentioned, I was shocked, but then I realized that he uses the time of day that is most productive for his body. <br><br>  Do not pay attention to what people consider normal. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Casey Neistat</font> </h2><br>  Thanks to this popular director and artist on YouTube, I have taught myself to keep a diary in which I post various thoughts, notes, reminders and events every day.  I specifically chose a small notebook that fits easily in my pocket, and can be used anytime and anywhere. <br><br>  The last few months have been the most difficult for me, and my little diary has helped me overcome all difficulties.  By the way, I also found a way to return this notebook (as well as all the other things I own) in case of loss - you should sign each item ‚ÄúIf you found this, please return (Initials and phone number)‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Tim Ferris</font> </h2><br>  From Tim, I learned to plan art.  This is easy to do when all planned cases are recorded in a notebook - after the sheet is executed, it is simply pulled out and thrown out.  Very simple but effective method. <br><br>  And one more thing from Tim: you should not be the first in any undertakings.  Better wait a bit, see how people use it, make mistakes, and gain experience.  And when the time comes, you will show yourself and be the best. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Robert Green</font> </h2><br>  Robert Green - a well-known author of the 48 laws of power, taught me to write books. <br><br>  His card system has changed my whole life.  Reading books, I make bookmarks on key points that I especially liked.  After that, I rewrite the information on the cards and store them in boxes, pre-ordering and breaking them into separate groups.  At the moment, I have accumulated hundreds of thousands of such cards and now, in order to remember the anecdote I liked, the story or use the strategy of an author, I don‚Äôt need to re-read the whole book, it‚Äôs enough to turn to my card boxes. <br><br>  I also learned from Robert to use swimming as a powerful tool for increasing productivity.  You ask, what's the swimming?  Just when you swim, you are surrounded by complete silence, nothing distracts and you can completely retire and <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-perestat-otvlekatsya-na-rabochem-meste-6-effektivnykh-sposobov/">concentrate on your thoughts</a> . <br><br>  Some of my best ideas arose just during such heats. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Dov Charney</font> </h2><br>  When I first called Dov, I came across an answering machine, who told me the following: "I do not use an answering machine, so send me an e-mail." <br><br>  I went even further and stopped using the answering machine at all.  If someone wants to tell me an important news, they will certainly call back later, or I will dial when the time comes.  In any case, I no longer worry about the audio recording ‚Äúyou have 6 new messages‚Äù, because  on my phone they just don't exist. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Ramit Networks</font> </h2><br>  Ramit before our eyes created a multimillion-dollar educational business with a staff of more than 40 employees (we grew up in one small town). <br><br>  I learned one trick from Ramit, at first ignoring his value many times, hiring a wiser and more experienced person to help you than yourself. <br><br>  A lot of people make a grave mistake by hiring cheap young people to help them.  It's just insane - how can a young inexperienced person immediately understand the value of time !?  Therefore, it not only does not become for you a tool to increase productivity, but on the contrary, it slows down the whole process.  If you want to help yourself - choose the right and do not save on it. <br><br>  And one more thing from Ramit - you do not have to respond to all incoming messages, the "Delete" button is a reliable way to get rid of unread mail. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Tobias Wolf</font> </h2><br>  In his book ‚ÄúOld School‚Äù, which is half the author‚Äôs autobiography, Tobias records all quotes and excerpts from great books.  I also do almost every weekend. <br><br>  This allows me to become a faster stenographer, a better writer, a versatile person. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">David Alain and Merlin Man</font> </h2><br>  Mailbox is empty. <br><br>  Never touch the paper twice. <br>  It is necessary to introduce these two phrases into your habit. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Napoleon Bonaparte</font> </h2><br>  Napoleon has a great quotation where he talks about how problems written in unread mail were resolved by themselves after a certain time. <br><br>  I try to do the same with my unread mail and problems. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Marco Arment</font> </h2><br>  The installer has changed my life.  I do not play toys on my mobile phone, but I read interesting notes that I made a little earlier.  I do not interrupt reading the notes during important matters, but simply transfer this activity to my free time. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">James Altucher</font> </h2><br>  ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is a powerful productive word.  It seems to us that we should always say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to everyone, and then we are surprised that there is not enough time for anything.  Learn to say ‚Äúno‚Äù more politely, for example, ‚Äúno, thank you‚Äù - excuses you and seems less rude. <br><br>  Use it as often as possible. <br><br>  One more thing from James: businessmen (and authors) are cranks.  To save your time and sobriety of thought, you need to find a soul mate who will get along well with you.  James and his wife Claudia are a great example of such a productive relationship. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/791/ebc/c5c/791ebcc5ccfc400ba8902f3c58bd330f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Montaigne</font> </h2><br>  From Montaigne, I learned the importance of simple books.  If something attracted you, be sure to write it down and use it later.  It's pretty simple. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Andrew Carnegie</font> </h2><br>  Carnegie has a wonderful article, ‚ÄúTo Be Presented to a Broom,‚Äù which he wrote in his early years.  It tells you that everyone must know and be able to do the lowest listed tasks. <br><br>  This does not mean that you have to do all the dirty work, but you have to know how to do it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Aaron Ray</font> </h2><br>  Aaron Ray was my mentor in Hollywood.  He is a very successful producer and manager, but I noticed a very interesting thing - he is never in the office.  And he always has absurd excuses on this score. <br><br>  I finally understood why he avoids being in the office - from a distance, you can appreciate the result of the entire team‚Äôs work much better than being directly in their society.  Removing, there are more opportunities and prospects. <br>  And as an added bonus, he became the most talked about character in Hollywood - everyone asked, ‚ÄúWhere is Aaron?  Has anyone seen Aaron !? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Tucker Max</font> </h2><br>  You might be surprised to learn that Tucker has the largest library you could see.  Why is she to him?  He simply buys absolutely all the books that are of interest to him. <br><br>  Now I do not spend time thinking about what book I want to read, or where to buy it cheaper.  I acquire it, read it, recommend it to others, draw useful information, and do not need anything else. <br><br>  I always read something and always strive to read even more books, because the shelves, menacingly hanging over me, unobtrusively hint at me - ‚Äúyou still have unfinished business.‚Äù <br><br>  I think Tucker is the person from whom I learned to listen to the same song over and over again.  This allows you to relax and get food for thought.  My playlist may seem ridiculous to many, but I do not care much about it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Nassim Taleb</font> </h2><br>  From the books of Nassim Taleb I gathered information about the so-called "anti-library."  Its principle is not just to collect the read books, but to replenish the library with new books that have not yet been read.  They will be for you a resource at hand, from which you can draw all the necessary information. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Samantha Hoover</font> </h2><br>  I learned one trick from her - I just deleted the Facebook application from my phone.  Don't ask why - just do it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Samuel Zemurray</font> </h2><br>  The owner of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company">United Fruit</a> , once said, ‚Äúdon't believe the rumors.‚Äù  We spend a lot of time on what we believe in nonsense, which we cannot confirm.  If we begin to act in accordance with fictitious judgments, we will lose a lot of time, which could be used effectively. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Unknown</font> </h2><br>  I do not remember who advised it to me, but never buy Wi-Fi when flying on an airplane.  Be offline and devote your free time to thinking or reading. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Adam Corolla</font> </h2><br>  Adam was always anxious about every minute of his schedule, so the producer‚Äôs demands to come 15 minutes earlier than the shooting, he refused.  I also try not to waste my time. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Niki Papadopoulos</font> </h2><br>  My publisher always said, ‚ÄúWell, now let's write this down,‚Äù after I told her my ideas about writing a new book.  Planning is nice, but productive people need to move forward. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Frederick Douglas</font> </h2><br>  ‚ÄúA man works where he has to work‚Äù <br>  You should stay away from the professions associated with toxic waste, environmental pollution, useless work, trying to solve insoluble problems. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Aaron Ray</font> </h2><br>  Another important lesson I learned from Aaron is that you should never deal with your own production; you must arrange a meeting, sign contracts, and other organizational issues with a special agent who receives money for this.  Spend your time better at what you do best. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/pyat-zabluzhdeniy-o-produktivnosti-kotorye-my-sebe-vnushaem/">Five misconceptions about productivity, which we inspire.</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289428/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289428/</a></p>
