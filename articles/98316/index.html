  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mass mutation or as Google blows off</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Google is one of the greatest companies that turned the world upside down, which continues to delight us with its technologies and services.  They promote cultures to the masses and do not ask for money at the box office.  This search, and API, and mail, and documents, and development tools and applications.  All that your heart desires. <br>  I have been using the services of this company for a long time and I was satisfied ... until a certain point. <br><br>  The first sign of my outrage was incomprehensible blocking of advertising sites, but the problem was resolved after a brief correspondence with the ‚Äúbot‚Äù. <br><br>  The second fly in the ointment was incidents of dropping user data, massive hacking of accounts, but I still believed, naively, that Google would win all.

      Today, another problem has arisen that made me think;  is it all so good and cloudless in the Danish Kingdom? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Not so long ago I trusted my e-mail domain of my favorite company.  Everything was going well, but terrible happened - one of the technical accounts was blocked due to violation of some rules (This account has been suspended due to violation of the rules). <br>  I reread the rules ten times and did not understand exactly which rules were violated.  The account is technical, it collects logs from servers and sends notifications from sites to a neighboring account in the same domain.  Well, sometimes it sends notifications from the site to customers (questions / answers / notifications / order data through the store). <br>  Mail, for me, is a rather critical service, and similar situations cause a lot of problems, especially when such problems happen in the most inappropriate place and even secretly. <br><br>  Support ignores questions.  The only thread on this topic, created in March 2010 by other users, is still unanswered.  It is impossible to ask a question in other ways, to questions sent by email - without an answer. <br><br>  Some kind of mass mutation occurs on the Internet: yesterday‚Äôs good companies are turning into something that provides service, but does not care at all about those who use these services. <br>  Well, you want the money - why provide a service for free and shout and beat yourself in the chest, that we are for free software and affordable services?  Who needs services without the ability to solve problems that will happen anyway sooner or later? <br><br>  Now Microsoft with its changes in licensing, then cellular operators with their ‚Äúunobtrusive services‚Äù, then Apple with their iPhone 4, now here‚Äôs Google. <br><br>  If only the notification was sent to the domain administrator, they say, so and so, the account is blocked for this and that.  No, because - quietly nailed account. <br><br>  In general, I am upset to the depths of my soul and disappointed.  What to do with the account - I do not know.  Whether to continue the battle correspondence, or reanimate your own mail server and do not worry any more about this ... <br><br>  Maybe it was messy, but such tricks don't make me happy.  Be careful.  Check your gmail accounts, all of a sudden you don‚Äôt receive mail, not because Google has a super antispam or no one writes to you, but because your account is blocked. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98316/</a></p>
