In this post I will try to talk about a simple way to increase the <abbr title="Depth of field">depth of field</abbr> .  This is a very urgent problem for those who work with a microscope and are engaged in macrophotography.  The essence of the problem is that at large magnifications, blurring objects distant from the focal point becomes a big problem.  This is in traditional portrait photography blur background allows you to emphasize the object.  In scientific micrographs, this is most often a negative effect.  I am glad that there is a focus-stacking technique that allows you to stitch a stack of photos with a different focus point into a single sharp picture.  But stop talking about the abstract.  Bring tick in the studio! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  If it is not visible, it does not mean that he is not eating you right now. </h4><br>  It all started quite trivial.  My beloved Fatshedera began to rapidly sink away and in every possible way try to die despite leaving.  Since I work in a <s>secret</s> laboratory <s>headcrab project</s> , I have access to microscopes and other interesting pieces of iron.  I shook the leaf above the slide and saw whole legions of the sweetest creatures that tried to crawl away from the bright light.  I decided to take a photo for memory before the mass genocide, but I ran into the problem of depth of field.  Not only did this animal move sluggishly even when it was flooded with alcohol, it was also too voluminous to get into a sharp zone at once.  It looked like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ab/3d0/4f7/9ab3d04f76834b3da66bd54d3a8df62a.gif"><br>  We had to come up with something to get a sharp picture. <br><br><h4>  Z-stacking </h4><br>  I turned to the traditional method of stitching a series of photographs, but was unpleasantly surprised by the prices of commercial products.  Especially if it is software from the manufacturer of the microscope.  There is generally a quiet horror.  But since we are not in vain for the Linux users and the Stallman icon to be regularly wiped from dust, we will look for free software.  Immediately there were Hugin and Enfuse, which allow you to do everything beautifully and from the console, which is extremely convenient for mass processing of photos. <br>  We have two main stages: <br><ul><li>  (Hugin) Aligning photos to common control points </li><li>  (Enfuse) Actually stitching it all together </li></ul>

      <a href="http://software.bergmark.com/enfusegui/Main.html">A GUI is available for Enfuse</a> , but we will work from the console.  Install the necessary packages for Ubuntu (they are available for Windows, the syntax will differ slightly): <br><pre><code class="bash hljs">sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install enfuse hugin hugin-tools -y</code> </pre> <br><br>  At the first stage we put all our images in a separate directory.  If necessary, fine-tune the white balance and exposure using the same RawTherapee.  After this, we align it to level the camera shake or, in this case, a slight movement of the patient: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">align_image_stack -v -m --gpu -a aligned -C *.jpg</code> </pre><br><br>  Please note that we are trying to use GPU through OpenCL for calculations, which is much faster, but does not always work.  If it falls, remove the option --gpu.  Next, -a aligned creates new files with the appropriate prefix.  * .jpg - mask for selecting files to be aligned. <br>  As a result, the console gives us this conclusion: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Console output</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="bash hljs">meklon@RegenLab-LinuxDesktop-1:~/ownCloud/Temp/2016.04  /converted$ align_image_stack -v -m -a aligned -C *.jpg Creating control points between Image_299.jpg and Image_300.jpg Trying to find 8 corners...
