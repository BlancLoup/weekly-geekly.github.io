  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Generation Arduino. What modern schoolchildren invent</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What to hide, we all in our childhood tried to construct something technical.  Oldfagi still remember the electric constructor-radio, games on a programmable calculator and home-made cars on the radio.  Now, with the advent of Arduino and LEGO Mindstorms, new horizons are available to modern students.  PSB, together with the Foundation for Promoting Innovation, held a conference of the finalists of the Shustrik All-Russian Competition and selected 6 quite good technical ideas.  Write your ratings and stories about your first inventions in the comments. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b7/rl/i3/b7rli3fdibc_5wygcwhekqw8_ns.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For modern schoolchildren in the big cities of Russia, greenhouse conditions have been created for technical creativity.  It would be a desire to invent.  In the engineering classrooms, digital schools and palaces of creativity there are all the necessary materials, machine tools, 3D printers and electronic distribution.  So you can bring to life the most courageous thoughts, especially not caring about their practical applicability and economic feasibility. <br><br><h3>  Mobile printer </h3><br>  Developer: Alexey Asharin, 16 <br><br>  When you need to print something larger than standard A4, problems arise.  Usually this requires bulky and expensive equipment.  And what if not to insert a sheet into the printer, and to force the printer to crawl on the sheet?  Thus was born this mutated robot vacuum cleaner with a feather. <br>  The body parts were designed in 3D and printed on the printer, the electromachine is assembled on the basis of the Arduino Mega ATmega2560, 4 stepper motors 28BYJ-48 with ULN2003 drivers, SG90 servo motor and 4 omni-directional wheels.  It remained only to program the movement of the printer and raising / lowering the pen.  On Arduino IDE it is not difficult. <br>  The prototype as a result looks impressive, for parts it costs only 3-4 thousand rubles, but the speed and accuracy are clearly insufficient.  And the initial loading of the image is not implemented, you need to specify all movements in the code.  But draws. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/am/cu/knamcun5uycbdq36oxalk7dkody.jpeg">

    <h3>  Technical system for preventing and overcoming stuttering during a performance </h3><br>  Developer: Arina Filimonova, 12 years old <br><br>  Can stuttering be ‚Äúturned off‚Äù for a while in order to make a presentation or take part in a discussion?  It turns out you can.  It is necessary, on the one hand, to set the brain pace to synchronize speech, and on the other - to distract the nervous system from the spasm in the larynx area. <br>  The system consists of a metronome, a Bluetooth-earphone and a myostimulator.  The metronome is based on the Arduino Mega 2560 board and Keystudio IR Receiver.  The frequency of the signals is adjustable in the range of 40-100 beats per minute.  The sound is fed to a piezo emitter or via Bluetooth to the headset.  The metronome itself is retracted in the pocket. <br><br>  Myostimulator is also assembled by hand.  It produces a pulse current of 10-15 mA with a duration of 1-100 ms.  The device is mounted on the skin in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe diaphragm.  Under the action of current, an isolated painless contraction of the abdominal muscles occurs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nl/qj/tx/nlqjtxzpr4u7h9p5pamb08m7frg.jpeg"><br>  What is the result?  Arina tested the device on herself.  He allowed her to forget for a while about stuttering, methods of controlling breathing, avoiding certain consonants, and simply telling the presentation.  The system is working. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p5/w_/gz/p5w_gz3kcjb7wthn2rjlzijexfu.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Satellite </h3><br>  Alexandra Sokolova, 9 years old <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/821SEE8knq0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  That inventor is bad, who from an early age did not invent something cosmic: a prototype of a rocket, a super-engine or a new miracle weapon.  Since childhood, you need to think globally.  The satellite model just fits into this concept. <br><br>  The nanosatellite itself is a brick with wings, equipped with a power source, temperature and orientation sensors in space, as well as a radio transmitter.  The data is sent to the console, displaying telemetry on the screen. <br><br>  The filling is assembled and programmed on the Arduino.  The orientation module includes a 3-axis gyroscope, an accelerometer and a magnetometer, which makes it possible to accurately determine the position of the satellite relative to its original position.  The digital sensor measures temperature to the nearest tenth of a degree, and the communication module transmits telemetry up to 1500 meters in direct visibility. <br><br>  Of course, if such a satellite is launched into orbit, it will turn into a pile of iron: the stuffing is not designed to work in space, the transmission distance of the signal is tiny.  But for the development of programming skills and a sense of belonging with the cosmos will go well. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5k/kg/y2/5kkgy2hncdvothlikn5p6mwm_w4.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Dancing robot artist </h3><br>  Gleb Zagorsky, Timur Tsibikov, Philip Samborsky, 10-12 years <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uejq6ypoFAM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  A humanoid robot performing all of your teams, an artist capable of singing and dancing on performances organized by you.  To feel like a Karabas Barabas, now you need not so much.  Develop a 3D model of the robot's body and print it on a 3D printer, assemble a motion platform on the Arduino, program it, and the puppet theater is ready. <br><br>  The guys used an Arduino Nano 3.0 ATMEGA328P microcontroller, SG90 servo motors, HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensors, piezo speakers, and LED arrays.  Programmed it in the MBlock visual environment.  Wrote using AppInventor app for Android, allowing you to control robots. <br><br>  Yes, the robots are not very similar to people, the set of actions is limited, but it is worth adding a little imagination, and you can already put home performances. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/22/zk/pr/22zkprqcbvczvhf880jejo3mbi4.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Heated Jacket </h3><br>  Nikita Skurkov, 13 years old <br><br>  Heated jacket is particularly relevant in the northern and eastern regions of Russia, so we included this project in the article.  Yes, there is no electronic filling in it, the circuit is as simple as possible: power supply and resistance.  The trick is to calculate the resistance of the wires needed for sufficient but not excessive heating. <br><br>  In this case, it took 8 meters of wire with a diameter of 0.5 square meters.  mm  A wire is formed from the wire, attached to the lining of the jacket.  It remains only to install the switch, connect the power source - and forward.  True, the author of the project did not have the power bank at hand, and he used a power unit from an ATX-format computer. <br><br>  The self-jacket jacket is a useful solution, although there are a number of obvious drawbacks.  The battery lasts a maximum of 3 hours, when it is re-charged without a protection card, it can easily catch fire.  To wash such a jacket will be difficult - you will not throw into the machine.  Well, I would like to look at the eyes of the guards in the subway, when they see the wires sticking out of the jacket ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8k/gd/ip/8kgdip4vezamcovv14pixqk21co.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Trubofon + </h3><br>  Alexander Dorokhov, 8 years old <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epKALAof3RU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  To invent your own drum set from improvised means?  Why not.  In the best traditions of the show group Stomp, the instrument is assembled from PVC sewer pipes with a diameter of 32 mm.  The pitch of the sound depends on the length of the pipe; blades like ping-pong rackets are used to play. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2o/jd/fy/2ojdfyzdosdngegchj3cu1vcyge.jpeg"><br>  The electrical part is presented in the form of LEDs inserted into the pipes, which light up when the contact closes when struck by a spatula (by the way, a very original solution with a spring).  Powered by finger batteries. <br><br>  Playing such a trubofone is simple: you take the shoulder blades and knock on the necks.  The sound is very unusual. <br><br>  As you can see, today's young people are seething with ideas, looking for themselves, trying to find something new even where everything seemed to be cemented forever.  It‚Äôs good that they have the right tools with which to do this quickly and inexpensively. <br><br>  Be sure to share your experience, what you invented in childhood, how difficult it was, and how it helped you in adult life.  Let's see how creative hobbies were transformed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459484/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459484/</a></p>
