  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Central Telegraph" offered pay TV</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From October 1, <a href="http://www.moscow.cnt.ru/">Central Telegraph</a> began commercial testing of the Digital Television service.  It will be accessed by subscribers of the unified multiservice network of the Moscow region - <a href="http://qwerty.ru/">QWERTY</a> , covering over 800 thousand apartments in Moscow and about 270 thousand apartments in the cities of the Moscow suburbs. <br><br>  The company reports that not only air, but also satellite TV channels are broadcast over the network.  At the moment, 24 channels are offered, and by mid-November their number promises to increase to 52. Digital TV auditoriums have access to the basic TV-Navigator service, which includes a number of services for watching the program guide.  Until December 31, the company does not charge for the use of "TV-navigator".  In addition, all equipment is provided free of charge (Set-Top Box, Remote). <br><br>  The launched service of digital TV ‚ÄúCentral Telegraph‚Äù calls basic - on its foundation it is planned to develop a real interactive television, QWERTY.TV.  In the meantime, those who have subscribed to the service will receive the best quality image and sound, as well as a set of satellite channels - that is, the ‚Äújoys‚Äù of full-fledged interactive are still ahead.

      It should be noted that ‚ÄúDigital TV‚Äù is a package offer that is offered only to users of the QWERTY.NET high-speed Internet access service.  That is, far from all 800 thousand Moscow apartments connected to the QWERTY network will be able to translate their television sets to ‚Äúdigital‚Äù. <br><br>  Sergey Kuzichkin, head of the video department of <a href="http://corbina.ru/">the Corbina Telecom company</a> , considers the Central Telegraph initiative to be correct, ‚Äúas subscribers need to be provided with the full range of TriplePlay services in conditions of tougher competition.‚Äù  From this, he noted that the hardware and software solution chosen by the company belongs to the first generation of IPTV systems and was relevant 2 years ago.  At the moment, he has been replaced by more modern and more functional systems. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis solution has the ability to provide a certain set of interactive services: interactive TV broadcasting, video on demand, personal video recorder, etc.  - said the representative of the Corbina to Habrahabru.  ‚ÄúAnother question is that of the above, the company will actually be used as the services provided.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to talk about the prospects of this brand when little is known about it,‚Äù says Evgeny Ryabovol, spokesman for <a href="http://mtu-intel.ru/">MTU-Intel</a> .  - The success of a pay TV operator depends on several components: content, tariff policy, coverage of the territory.  So far, only the territorial coverage of this operator is known - it is pretty good considering the fact that QWERTY will be the fifth player in this market. ‚Äù <br><br>  Yevgeny explained that it is difficult for several pay TV operators to coexist on the same territory, since the prices on the market are already quite low, the content is almost the same overseas, and the additional services and content of its own production are still beginning to develop.  ‚ÄúTherefore, the main competitive advantage at this stage is to appear in a certain territory before anyone else,‚Äù he added.  - The subscriber base manages to dial the one who came to this territory earlier.  So far, only one thing is clear from the actions of QWERTY - they understand that they need to enter the market as quickly as possible. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4468/</a></p>
