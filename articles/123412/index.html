  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Freelance and withdrawal: personal experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, residents of Habra!  I have been doing freelancing (although I don‚Äôt really like this word) for the past four years.  In this small topic, I would like to talk about the various ways of withdrawing money earned by overwork.  To begin with, it is worth mentioning how my work is organized.  I use only two options - oDesk and work directly.  It has not been possible to work with clients from Russia yet, so there will not be such familiar withdrawal options as WebMoney and Yandex.Money. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  As you know, oDesk offers the following ways to withdraw money: <br>  1) Payoneer Debit Card <br>  2) Moneybookers <br>  3) Paypal <br>  4) Direct Deposit / ACH <br>  5) Wire Transfer <br>  Pay attention to each of the methods. <br><br>  <b>Payoneer Debit Card</b> .  First you need to order the card itself.  It is easy to do, you just need to correctly write your address in English.  The card will come in the usual letter, it will be simply enclosed in an envelope with accompanying paper.  The card is activated through the site, and it can already be used.  With Odeska money gets fast enough.  In this case, the funds appear in your account, but the card (by default) does not immediately fall.  They need to be downloaded there.  Option two - download in the usual way (up to two business days), or download quickly (within two hours, but for $ 4.5).  You can make the choice of the boot option made automatically when transferring money.  During my use of the card, the terms of use changed, this was mainly in the amount of commissions (monthly fee).  Currently, such conditions are $ 1 per month, if over the past month there were more than two transactions on the card, if from 0 to 2, then $ 3.  The card can be replenished without Odesa (or another Payoneer partner) using another card.  At the same time, a commission of 4.5% is taken.  Summarize:

      Pros: <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can pay via PayPal without a headache with virtual cards (probably for Russia, perhaps) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Quick access to earned money <br>  ‚Ä¢ American card, nobody seems to know about your money <br>  Minuses: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Commission 1.8% when making payments via the Internet (such as due to the fact that transactions are conducted in the territory of another country) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Commission when replenishing a card using another card <br>  ‚Ä¢ It is still expensive to withdraw cash from ATMs <br><br>  <b>Moneybookers</b> .  Payment system in which you open a virtual account and use it.  Moneybookers is not very common and is known in our country, abroad, its popularity, apparently, is also much inferior to such systems as PayPal, for example.  The special feature of Manibukers is a very tight security system.  By default, money can be displayed on the card and bank account.  But after a while you will be asked to complete the verification procedure.  Verification comes down to the following: a small amount is transferred to your bank account, and there is a verification code in the field of payment purpose (reference).  You need to go to the bank (or Internet bank, if possible), and ask what is written there in the purpose of payment.  Everything works, everyone is happy.  Only I just did not work out, because  when asked about what was in the reference field, the girl in the bank patted her eyes and said that they did not have this.  I had to demand a printout of the translation details, ask to put a seal on it, scan it and send it to Moneybookers support (by the way, they speak Russian, which is undoubtedly a plus).  The card to which money can be transferred from the account in Moneybookers can also be verified.  Just like in PayPal, a small amount is withdrawn from the card, and for verification you need to enter its exact value (2.56 dollars for example).  In addition, there are withdrawal limits.  Verification directly affects the outgoing transaction limit.  In addition to verification of the card and bank account, you can get a letter to your address and enter the code in the letter.  Then the limit of outgoing transactions will increase significantly.  By the way, about withdrawal to a plastic card - you should inquire about the possibility of this in your bank in advance, because  At some banks, the policy prohibits direct replenishment of cards from abroad.  Last used Moneybookers a few years ago, because  they brought the brain to me with their procedures.  Summarize: <br><br>  Pros: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Can be output directly to your card <br>  ‚Ä¢ Withdrawal to a bank account is somewhat cheaper than Wire Transfer. <br>  Minuses: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Security procedures <br><br>  <b>Paypal</b> .  Does not work in our area for the withdrawal of money. <br>  <b>Direct Deposit / ACH</b> .  Also does not work in our area. <br><br>  <b>Wire Transfer</b> .  Direct transfer to a bank account.  All that is required for this is to find out the details for international transfers in your bank, drive them into the system (or inform the customer), and use the results.  Direct transfer costs $ 30, the commission in the case of Odessa falls on us, in cases of work directly - by agreement of the parties concerned.  Do not forget that banks also love money, and take money for processing currency transfers (maybe not everything, but in my case it is just that).  There are also correspondent banks (I don‚Äôt understand very well what they are for), whose services your bank can use.  They also love money, they can also take something.  A few years ago, the translation had to wait a few days.  Then something changed dramatically, and they began to come the very next day.  This is definitely a plus, speed, we appreciate and love.  In addition, it should be said that, receiving funds from legal entities, you are likely to fall into the sphere of interest of currency control.  For an individual, this does not pose any difficulty, except (in my case, at least) the need to come to the bank and write an application for receiving a transfer.  Simply put, you need to inform in writing, for what exactly these funds were received.  Let's sum up: <br><br>  Pros: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Money goes fast <br>  ‚Ä¢ There is no commission at the ATM (or cash desk) of your bank or it is minimal <br>  Minuses <br>  ‚Ä¢ The transfer fee is too large (it should be used when transferring large amounts) <br>  ‚Ä¢ The origin of money in some cases has to be reported officially <br><br>  So, I gave an overview of the possibilities of withdrawing money when working through Odessa.  Perhaps, Odessa is one of the most accessible ways to get acquainted with the celebration of life called ‚Äúwithdrawal of money‚Äù.  But Odesk doesn‚Äôt limit remote earnings.  In addition, Odesk takes a commission of 10% of the money paid to the employee.  Not everyone is happy with it.  And here everyone can choose a payment method to their taste. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123412/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123412/</a></p>
