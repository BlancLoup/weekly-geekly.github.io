Very often, our goals are starting points for other goals.  Often we perform actions without even meaning ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù, Thus spending time and energy on actions that do not bring value ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muda_(Japanese_term)">Muda</a> ) or spending time and energy on results that are not worth it ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This article focuses on an easy-to-use technique that allows you to organize the process of identifying the goals underlying the actions of people in the framework of the workflow under study (for example, the process in which you plan to use a software product). <br>  In other words, this technique will allow to form an understanding of the ‚Äúvalue chains‚Äù within which it must fulfill its functions and ‚Äúour future / current product‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  5 Whys - What is it? </h2><br>  A technique for analyzing the causal relationships of the underlying problems, the purpose of which is to find out the key problem. <br>  <i>The technique was developed by Sakichi Toyoda and used within the framework of the Toyota Motor Corporation.</i> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <strong>The essence of the technique is to ask the question ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Five times, each subsequent question is asked in relation to the answer received.</strong>  <i>With a typical example you can find here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">Example</a> .</i> <br><br>  Why 5 times?  It is believed that in 90% of cases it is enough to clarify the root cause, but practice shows that everything depends on the quality of questions and answers, i.e.  it is possible to reach the key problem earlier, and it is possible to go completely to the ‚Äúside‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  5 Whys - in business analysis ... </h2><br>  We will consider the adaptation of this technique to develop a ‚Äúuseful‚Äù software product. <br>  Instead of the question ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù We will use the question ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù To consistently find out the ‚Äúvalue chain‚Äù in the analyzed process. <br><br>  <b>Example 1:</b> application for laboratory tests within the clinic <br><blockquote>  The doctor forms an application for laboratory research for the patient. </blockquote><br>  <i>Value chain 1 - fulfillment of an application</i> <br><ul><li>  that the laboratory assistant conducts research in accordance with the application from the doctor </li><li>  the lab technician will document the results and provide them to the doctor </li><li>  for the doctor to analyze the results and draw conclusions about the disease </li><li>  for the doctor to develop a treatment for treating the disease </li><li>  for the patient to complete the course of treatment and recover </li></ul>  <i>Value Chain 2 - Application Execution Monitoring</i> <br><ul><li>  for the nurse to see that for the patient for whom she is observing the application has been added </li><li>  the nurse should periodically monitor the application status </li><li>  so that the nurse with the long-term non-application called the laboratory </li><li>  to clarify the reasons for non-fulfillment (delay in execution) of the application </li><li>  to ultimately complete the application </li></ul><br>  <b>Example 2:</b> Documentation of a meeting report with a client <br><blockquote>  A sales manager finds a client profile with which he held a meeting or conversation. </blockquote><br><ul><li>  to document the results of a meeting or conversation </li><li>  so that another manager who would like to contact the same client could familiarize themselves with this data </li><li>  to keep up with the latest news </li><li>  so as not to annoy customers with repeated questions </li><li>  to meaningfully hold the next meeting </li></ul><br>  Technique 5 Whys can be used to create different ‚Äúslices‚Äù in the analysis of the ‚Äúvalue chain‚Äù, since one action can have one or more goals, i.e.  creating a separate branch of the ‚Äúvalue chain‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  The technique is very easy to understand, but not so easy to use. <br>  In the process of accumulation of experience and with the correct initial data (knowledge of the subject area, within the framework of which it is necessary to clarify the value chains, the ability to formulate questions).  This technique becomes indispensable for creating a meaningful and concise description of the context and requirements for the product.  And most importantly, you will not lose your ultimate goal and will not waste your time and energy on actions that do not bring Muda values, but will spend them on creating a meaningful product. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152837/</a></p>
