      <b>Alexander Krakovetsky, "Where is the money in mobile development?", <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/sashaeve/" class="user_link">Sashaeve</a> , MS MVP:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúMobile is a young but stable trend of the last 5-6 years.  Despite the seeming simplicity of making money on mobile applications, not everyone can do this.  There are several reasons for this: dynamic development and no less dynamic decline of mobile platforms, high competition and the need to be not only a developer, but also a manager, sales and ... a predictor.  Statistics show that the majority of mobile applications are unprofitable, despite this there are a lot of success story of young entrepreneurs who earn well on their applications. <br>  Where is the money in mobile development?  What is better - to write games or applications for business?  Do I need to retrain in a mobile developer?  What platforms are best for developing?  Why does Android at 75% of the market generate less money than iOS from 15% of the market?  How to get a million Windows Phone and Windows 8 users?  About this and talk " <br><br>  <b>Denis Yaremov "Cryptography Algorithms - Everything is Simple and How to Use in Practice for Clients", senior software engineer at EPAM Systems Ukraine:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúI am going to talk about cryptographic currencies, now the topic of cryptographic currencies is incredibly popular, mainly due to the cryptographic currency BitCoin (http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin), but BitCoin is not the topic of my report, I plan to tell about another type of cryptographic currencies (about Ricardian Contracts), unlike BitCoin, Ricardian contracts allow you to create a digital currency with cash properties, such a currency can guarantee absolute anonymity, for example, you can write your money on a USB flash drive or send them  Avtsu by mail, and when crediting the currency issuer (bank) is not able to associate a certain monetary transaction with a specific pair of persons who committed it.  Using the information from my report, the developer will be able to create his own digital currency, embed it in his application, it can be, for example, large corporate financial applications, Internet games, other applications that need an additional security layer for account management operations.  The information presented in the presentation also contains basic information "for dummies" about the RSA encryption algorithm, does not contain and does not require highly specialized knowledge in this area, only 2 mathematical formulas of the level 3-5 of secondary school were used in the presentation. " <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Kostyuk "Creating a cloud - personal experience", <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/kostyukdv/" class="user_link">kostyukdv</a> , technical director of HostPro:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúIn my report I want to talk about how we built our cloud.  What chose for this server components.  During the report, I will tell you what problems we faced and how we solved them. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Bulanov ‚ÄúDirectory services: standard solutions for non-standard tasks‚Äù, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/hb860/" class="user_link">hb860</a> , MS MVP:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúMost system administrators, when working with Active Directory Domain Services, perform basic tasks, which include creating security principals and distributing them into groups, creating GPOs, and setting up administrative templates.  In turn, this report will talk about 11 tasks that domain administrators sometimes face, but they have difficulty in accomplishing them. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Andrey Cheredarchuk ‚ÄúHP-UX - database server platform‚Äù, instructor at HP Ukraine:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúThe HP-UX operating system is little known to a wide range of users.  At the same time, it is difficult to indicate the infrastructure of a telecom, a bank or a large corporation, where there is not a single server running HP-UX.  Reliable and scalable platform, flexible and stable operating system make HP-UX one of the most successful platforms for the Oracle database server.  But not only Orakl can be used as a corporate database. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Vladislav Kushnirov ‚ÄúClient PCs in the post-PC era‚Äù, product trainer in DELL Ukraine:</b> <br>  A report on market trends in terms of user requirements. <br><br>  <b>Ilya Kovalevsky "What is Qt and what can be done with it", <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/namespace/" class="user_link">Namespace</a> :</b> <br>  ‚ÄúThe Qt topic will be revealed, why it is very good and how it can help in practice.  Qt is not a small toolkit for the UI, but a very powerful comprehensive framework for developing software of various complexity. " <br><br>  The peculiarity of the meetings has always been the communication that takes place in addition to reports.  Many come only for the sake of a few reports but spend a lot of time talking to colleagues. <br><br>  I invite you to attend the meeting. <br><br>  PS <br>  <b>Event for registration <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/events/1791/">here</a></b> <br>  <b>Live broadcast <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNlc3CzGQLKc">here</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173761/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173761/</a></p>
