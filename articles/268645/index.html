  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Couponators are dead. Long live BonJoin</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/bonjoin/blog/268645/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/443/ebb/280/443ebb280f0b484c85e13c47dbce94f4.jpg" align="left" height="190"></a>  The peak of popularity of coupon sites that sometimes offered unbelievable discounts on goods and services has long passed.  There were many reasons: the bad faith of partners, the greed of the couponers themselves, and the artificial nature of this business.  And yet, it was the couponers that gave birth to the new trend - the active search by the consumer for the optimal offer, ideally balanced in price and quality.  This idea was used by the creators of BonJoin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the conditions of the market, the client and the performer are constantly looking for a friend.  This is an endless process, it is exhausting, it often brings disappointment - either the price is high, the terms are not satisfied, the quality is lame, it is impossible to pay comfortably.  Here both, the client and the performer, begin to lose patience.  And in order to save nerves, money and time, and the process of interaction between the client and the contractor is conveniently simplified, we created <b><a href="http://www.bonjoin.com/">BonJoin</a></b> . <br><br>  The search for an artist on the site is fast - within 30 minutes, 80% of orders receive more than 3 offers, for this it will take 2 minutes to place a request on <b><a href="http://www.bonjoin.com/">BonJoin</a></b> website for what you need.  Since several executors respond to a request at once, bidding for an order occurs: how competing performers are accepted at an auction to reduce the price for their services so that the customer chooses them.  Rating artists, reflecting their reliability, helps to make a choice.  Today, about 85,000 partners are registered in the BonJoin system. <br><br>  Working with <b><a href="http://www.bonjoin.com/">BonJoin is</a></b> easy.  The user searches for a service and visits the site where he first selects a category ‚Äî for example, insurance services, real estate, tourism, medical services, etc., and then fills out a form.  Each category has its own form with several fields that should be filled out.  The more detailed the form, the easier it will be for partners to make an adequate offer.  In case of something unusual in a given category, there is a field for arbitrary filling. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      After the user has sent a request, the system notifies all partners working in this category about the receipt of a new order.  They are potential performers of the order.  By accessing the BonJoin interface and responding to a request, they give their price and offer a brief description of how they see the solution to the task. <br><br>  Depending on the type of request, there are several options for viewing answers: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Customer can hide his contacts.  In this case, he assumes an active role and himself is engaged in calling the performers, whose contacts will be immediately shown to him; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The client can make his contacts visible, but only for the artist he chooses himself.  In this case, shortly after the user clicks the "select" button in front of the offer he likes, the executor will receive a call back to arrange for the provision of the service. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.bonjoin.com/">BonJoin</a></b> is a unique playground.  By registering here only one account, the user can act in three roles at once and freely switch between them.  That is, on the one hand, he can order some services, and on the other - act as a private individual or company.  Each role has its own set of features. <br><br>  <b>"User"</b> - the first and main role.  The ‚Äúuser‚Äù creates requests for free, manages the balance, and tracks cash flows.  Optionally, you can enable alerts via SMS and e-mail about the status of applications.  It is convenient and honorable to be a ‚Äúuser‚Äù: the contractor fights for his order on the principle of blind auction, offering his price for the service (goods) and not knowing about the prices offered by competitors.  BonJoin does not interfere with the relationship of the ‚Äúuser‚Äù and the contractors.  The ‚Äúusers‚Äù themselves participate in the formation of the ‚Äúreliability‚Äù rating, evaluating the work.  So the quality of work and the best price in the execution of the order are guaranteed. <br><br>  To date, the site‚Äôs partners have not yet covered all directions and cities.  New contractors are offered free access to all functionality, including customer requests. <br><br>  <b>"Private Executive"</b> immediately receives a number of bonuses.  This is a ‚Äúbusiness card‚Äù page, where a portfolio will be posted with photos of his work and a mark of his location on the map.  Also, the ‚Äúprivate executor‚Äù gets the opportunity to see the history of their customers' requests, a list of user questions in the ‚ÄúConsultations‚Äù section, customer complaints - which is very convenient.  In a special section of the menu ‚ÄúMy profession‚Äù there is an opportunity to subscribe to user requests for their profile activities.  But the main thing is that BonJoin guarantees ‚Äúprivate executors‚Äù official employment under a contract in accordance with the Labor Code of the Russian Federation, registration of the 2-NDFL certificate and payment of all taxes.  Thus, a ‚Äúprivate entrepreneur‚Äù registered at BonJoin from a shadow freelancer turns into a private entrepreneur with a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù salary and contributions to a pension fund, which gives additional advantages of cooperation.  By making all payments for the ‚Äúprivate executor‚Äù through its details, BonJoin acts as a tax agent for the ‚Äúprivate performers‚Äù and is the guarantor of the payment for the services of the ‚Äúprivate executor‚Äù by the customer. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúLegal entity‚Äù</b> - a company registered in the BonJoin system receives first of all the opportunity to conduct business using the advantages of the system, for which it has access to the tariff network of paid services.  Moreover, a ‚Äúlegal entity‚Äù can not only serve new customers, but also itself order services from private contractors and other companies, hold tenders for the supply of goods or services, selecting staff for outsourcing from private contractors registered on the site.  For example, a small business representative may find an accountant, call center employees, sales managers, etc.  BonJoin will pay for the taxes and the execution of the relevant documents. <br><br>  Note!  Now there is a promotional period for all legal entities, during which all services are free.  In the future, a monetization system will be introduced. <br><br>  BonJoin uses Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) for organizing email transmission within the system - this infrastructure seemed to be the most convenient from the point of view of sending a huge number of emails.  The interface itself is created using the Yii framework.  This choice is due to the high performance of the framework and quite powerful features for working with forms - and for the BonJoin service this factor has significant weight.  When developing the interface, the service team proceeded from the simplicity and convenience of users. <br><br>  To register a user, only one e-mail is sufficient - the user can fill in all the other necessary information in his profile, based on the selected roles and the need to work in the system.  Registration via social networks is also possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08b/ccd/b79/08bccdb797f74d27be69aef74dd3dc33.png"><br><br>  Application alerts are set up and managed using icons to the left of the application name in the list of user orders.  You can select an alert (SMS or e-mail), view the details, copy and delete the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bb/114/d29/8bb114d29d0141e4828e6d835b86786d.png"><br>  The most difficult and interesting point in the development of the interface was the work on creating forms of user requests.  Our development team studied the categories of various services: auto parts, insurance, tourism, medicine, pawnshops, evacuation, logistics, organization of events, etc.  As a result, large categories were divided into subcategories, for each of which forms were created to describe the client‚Äôs order as accurately as possible so that the implementing partner could give an answer based on comprehensive information.  The data in the forms are filled in successively so that the user does not forget important details for the formation of the order.  The filling of many fields is organized using a drop-down list - to create them, reference guides filled with data were built and loaded into the interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/775/d6b/499/775d6b4991624c4ea343fdeeb2c5bc73.png"><br><br>  For the convenience of working in one interface, a ‚ÄúBalance‚Äù section was created - a debit refill customer account, from which he can withdraw money for services rendered.  Account replenishment is variable: bank transfer, Webmoney, Yandex money, Qiwi, bank card and payment through the terminal.  In the balance section, you can observe the cash flow on the account: income and expenses.  Each section on the left has a built-in filter that helps as quickly as possible to retrieve the necessary data if the tables of customers / partners have grown too large. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad6/988/046/ad6988046aa0499fb2619888d4a2cf11.png"><br><br>  From the site you can download and install the application for Android.  It is not yet in GooglePlay, so you should run the downloaded .apk file.  The application so far duplicates the functionality of the site, so the user will be used to switching between interfaces. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.bonjoin.com/">www.bonjoin.com</a></b> is a free competition platform that will determine the best pricing and provide an opportunity to receive good services at affordable prices.  The first steps have been taken to connect a multitude of performers and customers, who leave mostly positive reviews.  Undoubtedly, BonJoin is the format of the future.  Experts say that over time, standard search systems will lose part of their audience, which will always strive to use fast and effective business solutions.  The project is already living, and it will certainly develop both in terms of the quality of the selection of performers, and in terms of the interface and internal program logic.  BonJoin is open to any feedback, criticism and advice: a real socially valuable service is formed precisely through the opinions of all parties. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268645/</a></p>
