    <h4>  The study recorded a crisis in engineering and technology education. <br></h4><br>  Up to 50% of admissions in relevant areas are math school students <br>  and physics, that is, people who are most likely not able to master the relevant <br>  professional competencies.  Inflated number of universities of relevant profile, preservation <br>  Narrow (incomprehensible to applicants) specializations for admission also reduce <br>  attractiveness of engineering education for applicants.  In such universities it is necessary <br>  optimize figures of both budget and extrabudgetary receptions and modernize <br>  training, expanding the specialty and making them more attractive.  Usually <br>  low numbers are associated with narrow specialized trajectories, which confirms <br>  the need to accelerate the transition to a two-tier system of training. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Reception structure <br></h4>  In the composition of higher education institutions there is a group that sharply breaks away from the others in quality. <br>  enrolled students.  To it can be attributed from 10 to 15 universities.  We can call these universities <br>  ‚ÄúBranded‚Äù because strong applicants agree to go to these universities for less <br>  popular areas of study that do not attract them to other universities, and paid <br>  places.  For example, in the specialty "Software computing and <br>  automated systems "MIET has an average of 15 points higher than other universities, <br>  in the direction of "Instrument Engineering and Optotechnics" MSTU.  Bauman has 8-14 points <br>  higher than others and others. MGU and SU-HSE have an unprecedented average (70) and passing (55) points <br>  on paid tuition - characteristics that are such strong universities as MGTU im.  Bauman, <br>  MEPhI, GUU, RKHTU have a budget reception. <br><br><h4>  Quality Received <br></h4><br><br>  By the quality of applicants enrolled in full-time departments, the following <br>  University groups: <br>  - 5 universities - Moscow State University, Fiztech, FA, MGIMO and SU-HSE - with an average enrollment score of <br>  budget 83‚Äì86 out of 100; <br>  - 21 universities with an average score of enrollment on the budget from 70 to 78; <br>  - 17 universities with an average transfer rate on the budget above 60; <br>  - 17 universities with an average score on the budget below 60 (from 59 to 54). <br>  At the same time, the absolute majority of the first and second groups constitute, in addition to Moscow State University, Phystech and <br>  MEPI, socio-economic universities or universities with significant socio-economic <br>  constituent (Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, Russian State <br>  University of Oil and Gas.  Gubkin). <br><br><h4>  Famous Universities with a low passing score </h4><br><br>  The crisis zone includes a number of technical universities with big names.  it <br>  MADI (58 - the average score and 44 - passing), Moscow State Textile <br>  sixteen <br>  University.  A.N.  Kosygin (57 and 34), Russian State Geological Prospecting <br>  University.  Ordzhonikidze (57 and 37), Moscow State Building <br>  University (IISS) (57 and 51) and Moscow Power Engineering Institute (54 and 44).  In this case, all <br>  they, besides the IISS, have unacceptably low passing points: from 34 to 44. Such points <br>  correspond to three or three with a minus in the traditional system of knowledge change. <br>  It is obvious that in addition to a significant - 2-3 times - reduction of budgetary reception, <br>  the state should decide on the restructuring of these large universities and on the replacement of them <br>  management. <br><br>  Of course, I cannot quote all the most interesting, because I didn‚Äôt master 73 pages myself, but reading was more than entertaining. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79373/</a></p>
