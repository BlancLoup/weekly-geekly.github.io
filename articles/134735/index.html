    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If you follow the market of household appliances, you are fond of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù houses and just true technomans, you probably already managed to ‚Äútweet‚Äù (or ‚Äúlike‚Äù something on Facebook), if not from the screen of the refrigerator, then at least from the TV screen.  Fun, unusual, innovative?  Yes!  Useful, functional?  Is not a fact <br><br>  We decided to fix it and add a maximum of useful functions somehow related to the Internet. <br><br>  About six months ago, we (LG Electronics) presented our vision of the development of household appliances - LG THINQ Appliances.  Already in 2012, most of the flagship models will be equipped with THINQ ‚Äústuffing‚Äù (and some products are already working with it). <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/2vov.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So what can do our household appliances line LG THINQ (look for stickers on the package)? <br><br>  She can: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ save money, electricity and water; <br>  ‚Ä¢ adapt to your rhythm of life; <br>  ‚Ä¢ keep the house clean without your intervention; <br>  ‚Ä¢ monitor shelf life and availability of food in your refrigerator; <br>  ‚Ä¢ cook food remotely and exactly when you need it; <br>  ‚Ä¢ be always in touch and keep everything always in control through your smartphone / tablet; <br>  ‚Ä¢ carry out self-diagnostics, self-cleaning and self-call repair technicians; <br>  ‚Ä¢ to be beautiful; <br>  ‚Ä¢ be effective. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/2kyk.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Our refrigerators:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ they will warn you that this or that product has ended (which product the refrigerator will track is up to you); <br>  ‚Ä¢ will display on the screen of your smartphone or tablet information about what you currently have in the refrigerator and in what quantity; <br>  ‚Ä¢ show the exact date when you put a product in the refrigerator; <br>  ‚Ä¢ they will remember the time during which you do not disturb them or disturb them minimally (night or working day - for whom) and will work as efficiently as possible at a time when external heat loss is minimal; <br>  ‚Ä¢ if necessary, they will diagnose themselves (if there are any malfunctions) and inform the service center of the exact problem code, if the problem is minor (suppose the ice supply is blocked because the dispenser is clogged), then they will tell you how to fix it yourself; <br>  ‚Ä¢ will be completely under your control remotely on the screen of your smartphone or tablet. <br><br><img src="http://bit.ly/tRPffJ" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Our washing machines:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ erase things when it is convenient for you, at any time you can run a wash on any program you need in two "tapes" through the app on your smartphone / tablet; <br>  ‚Ä¢ self-diagnose, self-clean as necessary; <br>  ‚Ä¢ save water due to the system of analysis of the weight and volume of the loaded laundry and the selected program; <br>  ‚Ä¢ report problems to the service center and give recommendations on how to fix the problems yourself; <br>  ‚Ä¢ very effective, quiet in operation, reliable (we give 10 years warranty), not for nothing that we are world leaders in this product segment for the past 4 years. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/4rir.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Our microwaves, ovens and bread makers:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ prepare food when it is convenient for you, including two ‚Äútapes‚Äù.  All you need to do is ‚Äúload‚Äù the products in advance and give a ‚Äúgo-ahead‚Äù at any time convenient for you; <br>  ‚Ä¢ warn you about the readiness of food reminder on your smartphone; <br>  ‚Ä¢ select the best program on the Internet for the dish you want to cook.  The search is carried out by the name of the dish in the database, if this dish is not in it, then you can program the technique yourself, it will remember the settings and synchronize them with the database, which will be constantly updated in this way; <br>  ‚Ä¢ self-diagnose and self-clean when needed; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Prepare carefully, while preserving the beneficial properties of the product. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/5jnj.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Our vacuum cleaners (talking about vacuum cleaners, in particular, about the HomBot model):</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ clean the apartment while you are at work or on vacation, turning on and off yourself.  The vacuum cleaner has a built-in microphone and, in the absence of noise, it decides that it is alone in the house and you can start cleaning (the exception is night time when the vacuum cleaner does not work unless you program it to the opposite); <br>  ‚Ä¢ independently return to the starting point to recharge the battery; <br>  ‚Ä¢ controlled from the smartphone screen, complete control, including the movement of the apartment; <br>  ‚Ä¢ broadcast the image from a special camera to the screen of a smartphone / tablet.  Want to know what is happening in the apartment while you are in the office?  Easy! <br>  ‚Ä¢ neat, efficient and very quiet in operation. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/3apa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This is how it all works: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/d2NvPFO6sTw&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhicQlDX5m4wSfv6T3xozX2NySQLtA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  All of these features will be available in many of the flagship models of 2012, some things are already there (diagnostics, monitoring information about products in the fridge and self-programming). <br><br>  Updates for the "firmware" will be regular, and the home appliances themselves will get smarter from year to year. <br><br>  Some may argue that ‚Äúsmart homes‚Äù have been around for more than a year, but we want to note that, unlike complex and very expensive systems that were before, all LG THINQ equipment will be accessible to the average user, will go to the masses and we hope to completely change your perception of life. <br><br>  What would you like to see in the newest home appliances?  What features are you missing? <br>  Thoughts, comments, questions are always welcome. <br><br>  Thank. <br><br>  LG team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134735/</a></p>
