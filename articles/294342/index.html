Such large brands as Google, American Express and Mondelez are among their most active, and smaller brands tend to their performance. <br><br>  Below are the 9 main benefits that marketers receive from programmatic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Marketing one-on-one</b> <br>  Programmatic allows brands to more accurately respond to consumer demand.  Information about customers is used in such a way that the most suitable candidate looks at the relevant advertising in the best context. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      For example, a brand can use programmatic to interact with specific groups of consumers, targeting the device, geolocation, personal interests and content.  You can also show different versions of the same ad, so that it is more suitable looking by gender, age, income, etc.  Such an individual approach significantly increases the clickthrough rate and the conversion of the landing page. <br><br>  <b>Cross-device marketing</b> <br>  A thoughtful reader will surely ask, why is there so much Anglicism in such a small little article?  Unfortunately, not all terms, and especially terms from a completely new sphere, already have analogues in Russian.  Moreover, a literal translation does not convey the entire informativeness of phrases.  But back to the topic. <br><br>  <i>Cross-device marketing</i> is marketing, in which the advertiser uses several devices in order to effectively interact with the consumer.  For this purpose, an advertisement is created that is capable of broadcasting on different types of devices.  This may include not only smartphones and tablets, but also game consoles, TV with Internet access, personal computers, etc. <br><br>  Buyers today spend a lot of time researching and searching for products online using many different devices - regardless of whether they are B2C, B2B companies or independent consumers.  Programmatic allows marketers to work with consumers on smartphones and tablets simultaneously.  Cross-device marketing is good because it allows you to coordinate campaigns on various devices, and gives the marketer a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich of them his audience is responding more actively. <br><br>  <b>Complement existing marketing strategies</b> <br>  Thanks to the programmatic brands have the opportunity to improve the already existing marketing strategies.  For example, advertising on a mobile device attracts the first attention of new consumers, and the correct retargeting transforms the attention attracted to conversion.  In addition, the programmatic complements the inbound marketing by attracting high-quality leads to the brand's website.  Properly chosen advertising strategy, targeted at an audience of potential buyers at the right time increases incoming web traffic from consumers who already have a desire to accept the offer of the brand. <br><br>  <b>Open new audiences</b> <br>  Programmatic is able to increase the scale of advertising, thanks to the ability to identify and achieve precisely those audience members who are considered to be ‚Äúhistorically effective‚Äù - that is, they have a good history of clicks on similar advertising (for example, advertising a similar product of the same brand).  But beyond that, programmatic allows you to discover completely new audiences who may also be interested in a product.  For example, a brand of clothing for skiers and snowboarders that showed ads to people who were very passionate about sports sites found that its ads could be targeted to a completely new audience ‚Äî high-income parents who buy clothes for non-skiing teenagers.  Thus, it is possible to continue targeting loyal consumers and open new perspectives. <br><br>  <b>Improve targeting and waste</b> <br>  The programmer is mainly focused on the individual display, rather than on the purchase of equipment for the masses.  Due to this, the percentage of lost impressions is reduced.  Specially created mechanical system independently controls displays, based on current data.  For example, a financial brand may be of interest to mothers of thirty, the system will make it possible to find out that this brand is really interesting to mothers living in cities, and displaying advertisements to women in the suburbs will be a waste of money.  Automatic targeting allows an advertiser to have no doubt that at any time in a campaign, every ad impression reaches the eyes of the right consumer, just at the moment when it is necessary, in the right context and at minimal cost. <br><br>  <b>Save time and control campaigns</b> <br>  Advertisers who collaborate with full cycle programmatic suppliers can afford to save time and energy without managing the campaign.  After they have transmitted the targeting data and raw materials for the show, marketers of the brand can spend their time on other departmental tasks.  At this time, artificial intelligence will optimize impressions by collecting data about them, analyzing and targeting even more accurately. <br><br>  On the contrary, you can untie your hands too.  Marketers can have as much control as they wish.  The brand itself determines the frequency with which reports should be sent to it, also adjusts the blacklists and settings of other filters.  In addition, the marketer in any campaign, regardless of whether he himself controls it or transfers this authority to suppliers, has full control over private information about the brand, speed of costs and making decisions about the campaign. <br><br>  <b>Testing without commitment</b> <br>  Brands are not required to sign a long-term contract with one partner.  You can run a test campaign for a month or work with several partners at the same time to determine which one gives the best results.  The decision about where to run and who will do this is always in the hands of the marketer and can be changed at any time. <br><br>  <b>Buying high quality shows at low prices</b> <br>  Previously, programmatic was associated in people with some ‚Äúresidual‚Äù inventory.  Today, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãit has changed.  More and more leading publishers (publishers) present their inventory on the programmatic exchanges.  That is why the platforms, open and private, are now characterized by high quality hits. <br><br>  Campaigns continue to use low-priced purchases.  The programmatic system works in accordance with the cost expectations of the conversion of each display, thus minimizing the cost. <br><br>  <b>Raising return on invested capital</b> <br>  By defining the right consumers for targeting and the right context for it, the programmatic has a high return on investment.  The combination of low-cost impressions with improved targeting improves campaign results at each stage of the marketing funnel.  This, in turn, increases the return on invested capital. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294342/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294342/</a></p>
