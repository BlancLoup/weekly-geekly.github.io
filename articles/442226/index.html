If this is an information portal, then much depends on the content and political orientation.

      And finally, favorite torrent trackers. <br><br>  But in this post we will talk not so much about the reasons for blocking, but about the list of resources that are not available from Russian IPs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Censorship by Geography </h1><br>  Portal Freedom House annually publishes a rating of "openness" of the Internet in different countries.  Places in the ranking of countries are distributed according to the criterion "the smaller, the better."  Russia has this year a score of 67 points.  Of course, this is not the limit: China has traditionally more 88/100.  And then there is Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia, where these figures are 73 and 83, respectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89c/daa/533/89cdaa5335681ab0e6fed5d6798d24f6.png"><br>  <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2018/map">freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2018/map</a> <br><br>  A detailed report on Russia with the main milestones of the struggle can be <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2018/russia">found here</a> . <br><br>  It all began more or less decorously - from blocking frankly extremist resources (this is now under this formulation can get a resource, where under the post there will be a comment about injustice regarding the calculation of pensions).  Then the time came for the torrent trackers, after which the supervisory authority bravoly reported that a third of the users were accessing this resource at best. <br><br>  Well, and then it started - the era of the grandiose protection of personal data of citizens against bribing by foreign giants came.  And if poor LinkedIn still remains <a href="http://docs.pravo.ru/document/view/87232058/">blocked</a> despite the fact that the resource belongs to Microsoft, then titans like Google and Facebook are still only fined for certain amounts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/573/657/482/573657482179772e265a15039a0356f7.png"><br>  <i>Attempt to open Linkedin from the connection of one of the top providers, Moscow</i> <br><br>  So, what else will not work with the Russian IP-address. <br><br><h1>  Media services </h1><br><h2>  Spotify </h2><br>  Streaming service that allows you to listen to your favorite music.  With the base of the tracks, which does not weakly exceed domestic analogues. <br><br>  Almost entered the Russian market in 2015, but then the owners <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/07/05/647977-spotify-mozhet-viiti-rossiyu-vtoroi-popitki">changed their mind a</a> little against the background of the economic and political crises in the country (at least this reason is considered official). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a6/066/02f/7a606602fbe62c1709ef0ea8e368978b.png"><br>  <i>Spotify from Russian IP</i> <br><br>  But, like, guys <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/spotify-working-on-a-launch-for-india-one-of-the-biggest-markets-in-the-world">do not leave</a> attempts to connect our country. <br><br><h1>  Pandora </h1><br>  Also streaming service with a recommendation system.  And also meets here with such a window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d8/727/ac4/5d8727ac4d849dfcf26a435856ac1cf7.png"><br><br><h1>  BBC iPlayer </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b01/29b/869/b0129b86956e291eecd11154d12f594e.png"><br><br>  The guys from the BBC are able to make very high-quality content - from educational programs to good series.  Those who want to watch something from the streaming service presented in their service are most likely waiting for the already familiar geographical bummer.  Which is typical, unlike most services, which simply write that they are not working in our country yet, the BBC describes in detail <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/help/no_download">why</a> .  Spoiler - most often due to license objections of distributors. <br><br>  In general, to fully use the service, you need a British IP address.  The bonus is the ability to view content without advertising, unlike other allowed regions. <br><br><h1>  HBO </h1><br>  The studio that gave us the "Soprano Clan", "Game of Thrones", "The Real Detective" and many more pretty high-quality TV series.  All of them can be viewed in the original on the website of the studio, and some (usually the first seasons) episodes are <a href="https://www.hbo.com/watch-free-episodes">free</a> .  But, again - not in all countries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/337/f12/286/337f12286e234cbec627905f0c2d7216.png"><br><br><h1>  Messengers </h1><br>  Line, Imo, the BlackBerry messenger and VChat video chat are not very popular among our citizens. The personal data of Russians was also not stored correctly, and therefore not accessible from the Russian Federation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04c/4e4/fa3/04c4e4fa35d816cd5715e118ac4fac0b.png"><br>  <i>Attempt to visit vchat site</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4af/a92/e79/4afa92e790adbdf8241a5d00859c6e41.png"><br>  <i>And a similar entry on line.me</i> <br><br><h1>  Zello </h1><br>  Internet radio, which was quite <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/10/04/2017/58eb7dcc9a7947da5af21c22">popular</a> not only among truckers, but also among Internet activists.  In Russia, the service used about half a million people. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b58/906/9bb/b589069bb7158548328c1355e530619d.png"><br><br>  And if the blocking of these messengers in the CIS countries affected not so many users (even considering Zello), the story with Telegram was completely different. <br><br><h1>  Not telegram single </h1><br>  The desire to block Telegram was rather hot at first.  Plus, Pavel himself added some oil, sometimes a troll supervisory authority.  We know what came out of this - at the moment the messenger works for 9.5 / 10 users without any problems and supporting tools. <br><br>  But this is not the main thing.  In an attempt to block the RKN messenger, he blocked a huge amount of IP, which had a rather mediocre relation to it.  Because of this, a certain period of time many services did not work for Amazon, Google and Microsoft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/153/534/8c5/1535348c590a4e0acb41018534080665.png"><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/wall-76229642_168289">https://vk.com/wall-76229642_168289</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c2/a0d/2e9/5c2a0d2e900ccdb3304f56885ddeec9f.png"><br>  <a href="https://antizapret.info/stat.php">https://antizapret.info/stat.php</a> <br><br>  As a result, the reason for wishing good health to the supervisory authority was found among those users who did not use Telegram at all, but used services that stopped working due to Telegram attempts to block. <br><br>  For quite a few days, quite popular services of teamwork were working intermittently for users from Russia, including Asana and Slack (by the way, sometimes Asana also falls off without VPN). <br><br>  Tangentially, Blizzards from battle.net were also hurt - the service simply did not work for Russian users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f9/130/77f/8f913077fbc056bb72b0e3d41eba6c98.png"><br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzardCSEU_RU/status/1008637827515650048">https://twitter.com/BlizzardCSEU_RU/status/1008637827515650048</a> <br><br>  It got to the point that they began to sue the RKN - after all, due to uncontrolled blocking of everything and the whole range of companies that are not related to the case, <a href="https://pravo.ru/news/202193/">suffered</a> real losses.  In total, business losses are estimated at almost one <a href="https://pravo.ru/news/202150/%3Fdesc_emb%3D">billion</a> US dollars. <br><br><h1>  The Empire Strikes Back </h1><br>  Each attempt to dissociate itself has two sides - usually on each side of the wall.  Therefore, it is not surprising that a number of domestic services are available only from domestic aypishnikov. <br><br>  But anyway, for various reasons (from licensing to political) some resources can only be viewed from Russian IP. <br><br><h2>  Amediateka </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c86/83f/3c2/c8683f3c2d11ae1cb63428bfa6a598b1.png"><br>  <i>An attempt by an average New Yorker to watch their favorite HBO series in Russian</i> <br><br><h2>  Yandex.  Music </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/401/c00/de4/401c00de49281738e5b056ae8adecaef.png"><br>  <i>Something like this will look like an attempt to listen to Yandex.Music from France</i> <br><br>  At the same time, the restriction is rather formal - yes, for unregistered users, Yandex.Music works only from Russia, the CIS countries and Israel.  If the user is logged in and paid a subscription - works with the IP of any country.  But it makes more sense to go in to listen to Yandex. Music, if you already have a selection, playlists and tuned radio there. <br><br><h1>  Broadcast sports events </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bd/8dd/bf8/0bd8ddbf8702d6e1199e999030d8f1fc.png"><br><br>  <i>Live Match.TV for French user</i> <br><br>  Especially for broadcasts on different sites live broadcast of iconic sports events (for example, this was the case during the World Cup 2018). <br><br><h1>  How is VPN useful in this case? </h1><br>  VPN gives you the opportunity to get access to the information you want, rather than which you are allowed to view in a particular region due to political differences or problems with copyright holders on any media.  Plus, to ensure a sufficient level of anonymity (and this is often required not only to malicious violators, but also to ordinary citizens who are tired of the fact that resources receive too much information about them). <br><br>  Now we support a selection from 44 countries and periodically increase this list. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/158/3c9/e10/1583c9e10fd15dc3ee90599e6ce41385.png"><br><br><h1>  And what about prices? </h1><br>  And at prices everything is simple - with an annual subscription a month will cost 149 rubles.  Included unlimited traffic and the ability to use our service on <a href="https://hidemyna.me/ru/order/vpn/">5 devices at the same time</a> .  That is, you can connect your smartphone, laptop and desktop PC, plus you will be able to share the license with a couple of relatives or friends - we have applications for all popular OS. <br><br>  Maybe you know some other useful and popular services that are not allowed to come from Russian IP addresses or simply limit some functions? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442226/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442226/</a></p>
