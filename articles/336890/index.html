Since the materials are not an online course (we have not yet reached out), we cannot verify your work or your knowledge.  But we highly recommend not to watch the video ‚Äújust like that,‚Äù since this may be wasted time.  Start and try the examples is very simple! <br><br>  To get started, go to <a href="https://notebooks.azure.com/sosh/libraries/neuroworkshop">the course materials library on Azure Notebooks</a> and click the Clone button.  This way you will receive your copy of all materials, and you will be able to make changes to the code on the fly and see what happens.  Open the library in a separate window, and start watching the video. <br><br><h2>  Video </h2><br><h4>  Part I </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaBp0uiLvKQ&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhiydx0YdAHDRmgaa2by07Vz_mYpg"></iframe><br><blockquote>  <b>[0:00]</b> Introduction to artificial intelligence in general, cognitive services, Bot Framework, Azure Machine Learning.

Error propagation algorithm. <br>  <b>[1:48]</b> Lab: classification of irises. <br>  <b>[2:27]</b> Lab: Recognition of handwritten numbers. <br></blockquote>  For those who can't wait to get straight to the point - I recommend looking at 1:10, where we start using the Cognitive Toolkit to implement a simple classification task.  The basic idea is as follows: the neural network, which is shown schematically in the figure below, can be mathematically represented as the product of the weights matrix W by the input values ‚Äã‚Äãx, taking into account the shift b: y = Wx + b. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb7/dfd/75e/bb7dfd75e1c1a7b4a1c9c234382a6aa0.png" width="70%"><br><br>  CNTK neural network frameworks allow us to set the network configuration in the form of a ‚Äúcomputation graph‚Äù, essentially writing this formula: <br><pre><code class="python hljs">features = input_variable(input_dim, np.float32) label = input_variable(output_dim, np.float32) W = parameter(shape=(input_dim, output_dim)) b = parameter(shape=(output_dim)) z = times(features,W)+b</code> </pre> <br>  After that, the framework allows us to apply one of the learning algorithms, adjusting the weights of the W matrix, so that the neural network starts to work better on the training set.  In this case, according to a given formula, the framework assumes all the difficulties in calculating the derivatives necessary for the operation of the back propagation method of the error. <br><br>  Similarly, we can define configurations of more complex networks, for example, for a two-layer network with a hidden layer: <br><pre> <code class="python hljs">hidden_dim = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">5</span></span> W1 = parameter(shape=(input_dim, hidden_dim),init=cntk.uniform(<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>)) b1 = parameter(shape=(hidden_dim),init=cntk.uniform(<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>)) y = cntk.sigmoid(times(features,W1)+b1) W2 = parameter(shape=(hidden_dim, output_dim),init=cntk.uniform(<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>)) b2 = parameter(shape=(output_dim),init=cntk.uniform(<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>)) z = times(y,W2)+b2</code> </pre><br>  Using higher-level syntax, the same can be written more compactly in the form of a composition of layers: <br><pre> <code class="python hljs">z = Sequential([ Dense(hidden_dim,init=glorot_uniform(),activation=sigmoid), Dense(output_dim,init=glorot_uniform(),activation=<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">None</span></span>) ])(features)</code> </pre><br><br>  This part also discusses important questions about retraining networks, and how to choose the network ‚Äúcapacity‚Äù depending on the amount of training data in such a way as to avoid retraining. <br><br><h4>  Part II </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sF8d9Yt7JI&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj4toygJHYETqMq47Cky_zHsz1Sjw"></iframe><br><blockquote>  <b>[0:00]</b> Recognition of handwritten numbers. <br>  <b>[0:04]</b> Convolutional neural networks for image recognition. <br>  <b>[0:49]</b> Lab: Improve recognition accuracy with the help of a convolutional network. <br>  <b>[1:07]</b> Subtleties of learning: batch normalization, dropout, etc.  Complex network architectures to solve specific problems.  Autoencoders.  The use of neural networks in real projects. </blockquote>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis part is to tell how from base blocks (neural layers, activation functions, etc.) you can assemble more complex neural network architectures for solving specific tasks, using the example of image analysis.  The toolkits (such as Cognitive Toolkit / CNTK, Tensorflow, Caffe, etc.) provide basic functional blocks that can then be combined with each other. <br><br>  For example, in convolutional neural networks (Convolutional Neural Network, CNN) used for image analysis, a small window running through the image (3x3 or 5x5) is used, which, as it were, is fed to the input of a small neural network extracting important features from a fragment of the image.  From these signs, an ‚Äúimage‚Äù of the next layer is obtained, which is processed in a similar way ‚Äî in this case, this layer is responsible for the signs of a higher level.  Combining in this way a multitude (tens and hundreds) of layers, we get networks capable of recognizing objects in an image with an accuracy not much inferior to a human one.  Here, for example, how the multilayer convolutional network sees the number 5: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b50/ab6/468/b50ab64688b4437c83cc90054347748c.PNG"><br><br>  In the second half of the video, <a href="https://events.yandex.ru/lib/people/3361/">Andrei Ustyuzhanin</a> , Yandex-CERN project manager and the Lambda laboratory at HSE, talks about some techniques for building more complex neural network configurations for specific tasks, as well as optimization techniques for teaching deep networks, without which a significant increase in the number of layers and parameters is impossible . <br><br><h4>  Part III </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7hYq2dSY8A&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh9JzgjlKR8ZnE5ojbrJgyCmh7ZWw"></iframe><br><blockquote>  <b>[0:00]</b> Recurrent neural networks. <br>  <b>[1:09]</b> Teaching neural networks in the Microsoft Azure cloud through Azure Batch. <br>  <b>[1:36]</b> Recognizing ‚Äúcat vs. dog‚Äù images and answering questions. </blockquote>  The most important thing in this section is the recurrent neural networks, about which Mikhail Burtsev, the head of the laboratory of deep learning at MIPT, talks.  This is a network architecture in which the output of the network is fed to it as an input.  This allows you to analyze variable-length sequences ‚Äî for example, one pass of a text or one word of a sentence is processed in one pass, while the ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù is stored in the transmitted recurrent ‚Äústate‚Äù.  Based on this approach, machine translation systems, text generators, time series forecasting systems, etc. work. <br><br>  Here, for example, which texts are generated by the neural network from the example we are considering after 3 minutes of training on the texts of the English-language Wikipedia: <br><blockquote>  <i>demaware boake associet ofte</i> <i><br></i>  <i>russing turking or a to t</i> <i><br></i>  <i>jectional ray store one country or sentio edaph lawe</i> <i><br></i>  <i>t arrell out prodication</i> <i><br></i>  <i>zer to a revereing</i> </blockquote><br><h2>  Instead of conclusion </h2><br>  I hope we inspired you to study neural networks!  After viewing the course, it's time to come up with a task or project for yourself: for example, make a generator of poems or pseudo-scientific articles, or analyze which photographs people have with their eyes closed.  The main thing is to try to put knowledge into practice! <br><br>  You can train simple networks directly in Azure Notebooks, use the <a href="http://blog.soshnikov.com/2017/05/31/%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F-%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB/">Data Science Virtual Machine</a> in the Azure cloud, or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Setup-CNTK-on-your-machine">install CNTK on your computer</a> .
