On samopisnyh badges (which could have been changed several times), in addition to the participant's name, you could read ‚Äúlooking for a job‚Äù or ‚Äúneed a designer in a startup‚Äù (in many conferences, reinforced concrete name + office on a badge interfere with the creative identity of the current company).

      Moderator Beverly Mae announced the opening of the ceremony and explained who is the sponsors and <a href="http://userexperienceawards.com/panelists/">authoritative jury</a> .  The sponsors' welcome words revealed that they were aware of what the User Experience is.  They explained their motivation to become the main beneficiaries of the benefits of creating products and services in close contact with UX-agencies and independent consultants, stressing that the products and services were not only image-based. <br><br>  A representative of the startup community noted that most startups are being promoted by ‚Äúpure techies‚Äù, for whom the exchange of thoughts and cooperation with the ‚Äúend-user advocates‚Äù would be very useful. <br><br>  At the moderator's request to the members of the jury to define the User Experience, in addition to academic formulations, there were also thoughts that the UX is a new cinema (in terms of the content of work and general drive), and also that the UX is not fixated on forms and layouts and their wandering on mobile platforms, and increasingly resembles the work on the design of entire ecosystems. <br><br>  Then the <a href="http://userexperienceawards.com/2011-winners/">winners</a> were awarded, after which words of gratitude were taken by someone from the jury and explained in some detail the reasons for the victory of these particular guys. <br><br>  So, the guys from MODUS ASSOCIATES were awarded a certificate of honor for their heroic work on collecting in a single, intuitive solution the disparate intranet sites of the Cleveland Clinic, including the creation of an effective mobile version.  In his word, the head of the group mentioned that UX makes many hearts beat faster, while working on the project his group found out how literal this phrase can be. <br><br>  The creative team of ORGANIC, INC received his letter for the fact that, according to the judges, he created a whole new culture of interaction with him around content, moving further and further away from the legacy of newspaper and book metaphors towards something completely new. <br><br>  Silver awards received 3 companies and one freelancer. <br><br>  Freelancer WHITNEY HESS was awarded silver not only for creating the product, but also for a detailed transparent <a href="http://whitneyhess.com/blog/2010/01/27/the-ux-design-process-for-the-boxee-beta/">description of the work process</a> , as well as personal courage in insisting that this process was not violated by the customer. <br><br>  RAZORFISH created the best in the opinion of the judges of the iPad Experience, and HOT STUDIO proved the intuitiveness of its product with the number of books that the users-children created with its help. <br><br>  Serious guys from MORGAN STANLEY have created an application for people involved in investing.  The jury noted that the reaction time to changing data and confidence in making quick decisions is very critical for such a sensitive target audience.  The story of the transformation of merciless data into elegant content.  High-quality work of a bunch of UX-designer and graphic designer was also noted. <br><br>  The Nike sneaker chip and R / GA-NIKE + GPS work on a whole ecosystem of solutions for buyers of such sneakers received a grand prix.  <a href="http://judgeseyesonly.com/nike-plus-gps-ux-awards">This work</a> deserves a separate post. <br><br>  Everything ended in a bar nearby, where smiling bartenders lively exchanged tickets from the event for a single malt. <br><br>  <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/mardowitsch/album/118081/%3Fp%3D0%26ncrnd%3D3552">Some photos</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120857/</a></p>
