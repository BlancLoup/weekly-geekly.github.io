Something similar had to be experienced by us, the informers, who rallied at the time of the move of ‚ÄúInformzaschita‚Äù to a new house. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yz/9x/qy/yz9xqyqvokx9dpvr6vwt-zyxr68.png" height="220"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/st/l0/cj/stl0cj5oganvxylnj_yxccx6h_i.png" height="220"><br><br>  For years in our company there was a rumor about moving, more like a myth.  Nothing foreshadowed trouble - old, Soviet-style walls of an office building called Atlas Research and Development Center for 22 years served the company‚Äôs needs faithfully, and if someone could not get used to the stern walls there, then in six months no, no, yes he got used to it.  They say that there were cases when someone got used even to the local access system !!!  But this is absolutely from the category of fiction and rumors.  And the news about the company's relocation in September was perceived by many with a grin.  However, it was not there!  The management of the company this time was determined as never before decisively and it was necessary for hundreds of people to collect their belongings and vacate the premises in a matter of days.

We folded the boxes, packed things, threw away too much, helped each other to carry and carry everything, order new furniture, coped with the flow of thousands of small tasks, did five things at the same time, slept less, suffered more and did not stop working.  And you know what?  We very quickly during this time understood what mutual aid and dedication are;  that sometimes the simplest work turns out to be the most difficult, that claims and grievances become insignificant when a team is united by a big goal.  We did not know only one thing - how beautiful the office is waiting for us ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kf/xp/4c/kfxp4cetwx8l6cmcxxwsywlcnr8.png" height="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pg/6-/w-/pg6-w-kjjvtgabcutagd221pqve.png" height="250"><br><br><h2>  All ages are submissive to design. </h2><br>  When we moved, we were waiting for half-empty rooms, new furniture and design!  Yes, the one whose ode to the importance of which Steve Jobs always sang.  An important element of corporate identity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ac/hk/ju/achkju0_jf9hcdz6fx6vgheztrc.png" height="220"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oi/bh/as/oibhasfm1bpvarr3kaomtynn8cq.png" height="220"><br><br>  Thanks to the design, fresh colors and interesting elements in the interior, we managed to reassure the most inveterate relocation skeptics.  They, of course, grumbled a day or two, saying that it was somehow too beautiful and marco, but they still gave up.  No wonder they say - you get used to the good very quickly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sc/vl/bz/scvlbzyjcmmw5ycgluy9olpgwym.png" height="230"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kg/ix/i3/kgixi3bclmp-6bmdqplojds4mhi.png" height="230"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ul/r0/x9/ulr0x9gxhkado59yq1plonxjutu.png" height="233"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/06/ob/hc/06obhcwdzd5a326l20hwlh4gvo4.png" height="235"><br><br>  Now all the rooms are painted in company colors, and in the meeting rooms there are creative marker walls on which you can draw with felt-tip pens something important or beautiful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cu/_k/zw/cu_kzwzkp6v9nrqgya3a4ggvmpk.png" height="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rr/aq/td/rraqtdmz1nabblfkbgqe6hwyicm.png" height="235"><br><br>  For the design of the new office responsible management marketing department.  Just don't bother asking our marketers what this means.  They'll start telling you the story about glitch art - a trend trend in art, the expressive means of which are all sorts of digital and analog errors, bugs and the destruction of a digital code.  And that this is all very, very conceptual.  In general, marketers - they are.  They say the main thing - attention to detail.  It's true.  Go ahead - we will study in detail and other departments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ma/3a/3j/ma3a3jsnw_sp1a9a_xpoznz0mtm.png" height="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o1/gr/_-/o1gr_-whsx5qqtyxrbawow7ezxm.png" height="235"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bc/ae/ez/bcaeezefe3f0kcwdxdf-lxpfo2i.png" height="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tw/42/gv/tw42gv8qlh94ebklsdkhru-wnvo.png" height="235"><br><br><h2>  <b>One head is good, and a hundred is better.</b> </h2><br>  Before proceeding further - deep into the largest technical department of Informzashchita, it is worth noting that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe new office is about 5,000 sq. M.  These are two full floors of the Solutions Business Center, where we have safely moved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l7/ig/aw/l7igaw1gtuzrwr61lxylf-abru8.png" height="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0i/ed/pf/0iedpflcksyetxmwhob9ejt0lak.png" height="235"><br><br>  As for TD (this is how the department is called for the convenience of the people), then there is a change.  Employees received bright rooms with panoramic windows overlooking Petrovsky Park and the new Dynamo stadium.  And some were literally in the flower garden. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zr/yy/pt/zryyptvrecvnm7oo3pjubxeakna.png" height="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8b/z1/zd/8bz1zdacgc7iaxthzgi_gvdfdqy.png" height="235"><br><br>  Each inforzaschitovtsy also appeared wall myalkie panels on which you can attach different little notes and pictures.  On the tables of some of our colleagues, it is immediately obvious how gentle and tender they are about their place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tt/ni/5p/ttni5pur7bb49q-j4rd3mcxkbpm.png" height="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x1/2q/gn/x12qgnw8nlrc2rjkf2azpt6xibu.png" height="235"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rk/vf/mp/rkvfmp_z175clbcd_ez0i_jzy64.png" height="230"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/io/ay/qw/ioayqwotgxgbmbvsovifz90iwe8.png" height="230"><br><br>  In general, in order to understand that IBShniki are actually sensitive and kind people, it is enough to look at their faces and tables. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sl/-p/3j/sl-p3j1j0gfaarr8nq1nek_iium.png" height="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yd/z9/j-/ydz9j-kd8-jytwx5rhmmqoktryq.png" height="235"><br><br><h2>  <b>Client all head</b> </h2><br>  The customer is always right!  This is truly known to all.  We also believe that the customer is always worthy of the best.  For our office guests there is all the infrastructure - from the large hall with a food court to the cozy sofa areas on the floors. <br><br>  And this is what the Service Department looks like.  It is they who around the clock keep their finger on the pulse and help our customers a little bit what's wrong. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vs/zm/j6/vszmj6hxvybqm8p-mydcgw2hoya.png" height="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ob/o5/d5/obo5d5u13xe4ghccspaxqhsims4.png" height="235"><br><br>  Especially difficult situations are resolved at operational meetings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zn/ib/ew/znibewiyokclekncxni74biksae.png" height="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u5/gd/hb/u5gdhbvj9vlaacghmxtvxie3era.png" height="235"><br><br>  And although our service managers are mega-professionals, nothing human is alien to them.  They also encourage each other with ‚ÄúYou Can‚Äù postcards and cross out the days before the holidays on the calendar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/me/cd/eymecdhl6he67ts1e0jvax9ue0g.png" height="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wr/94/3v/wr943vlmxbrzkovmpogwyly4hd8.png" height="235"><br><br><h2>  <b>Accounting is immortal</b> </h2><br>  Well, what else to add, looking at these photos!  It is not easy for financiers and lawyers - they always have all sorts of daddies and papers.  Only you wonder how they understand all this and remember where everything lies.  Patience to you, our dear!  You are irreplaceable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hc/f1/6p/hcf16pwwylwrtmzlleecr80hz4i.png" height="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6v/u3/ab/6vu3abjwzfje09mqstouxmfltji.png" height="235"><br><br><h2>  <b>Without paper you are a bug</b> </h2><br>  ... or, without a living reward, consider it and was not.  So we think in HR and PR.  All stored, all polished. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/44/e_/hc/44e_hc3zhsosaic_od1wc9eaodg.png" height="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0o/wr/a0/0owra0qhbyvhau44p27rbsr9spy.png" height="235"><br><br><h2>  <b>Shambhala does not open to everyone</b> </h2><br>  And finally, let‚Äôs gaze into the holy of holies with one eye ‚Äî the leadership cabinets.  Even palm trees here are like ballerinas holding their posture.
