  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Solution of the problem ‚Äúshort left shift‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Comfort with long-term work with the keyboard is an important factor affecting both performance and hand health.  Often, we have to spend a few hours onboard without interruptions, therefore, apart from actually choosing the right keyboards (key travel height, travel rigidity, travel depth from the trigger point to the stop, tactile sensations from the key surfaces, keyboard body rigidity, keyboard layout, etc.) Think about simple tricks that allow you to improve the usability of the keyboard without any effort. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the category of ‚Äúwireless keyboards, with medium or low key travel, with medium hardness, just for intensive work (non-game)‚Äù, in my opinion, the leaders are Logitech keyboards. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of models of full-size keyboards from this company in localized versions (with Latin and second language characters, see note at the end of the article) do not fall into the category of ‚Äúfull-size keyboards with standard layout, two long Shift, large Enter, long Backspace‚Äù . <br><br>  The reason for ‚Äúmissed‚Äù in this category is the stubborn desire of Logitech designers and engineers to ‚Äúshorten‚Äù the left Shift by placing a duplicate key with slashes to the right of it (forward, reverse, vertical line).

      Often, to press a long left Shift, you use either a little finger, which is placed horizontally, or a little finger and a ring finger, or some other option - while intuitively assuming that the left Shift is long enough, and you should not try to press closer to the left edge of the keyboard.  Accordingly, erroneous clicks of the left duplicate "slash" key often occur. <br><br>  I used to suffer from this inconvenience, especially when I had to change from a keyboard with a long left Shift to a keyboard with a short - Logitech. <br>  Googling - which was not easy, because it is difficult to formulate a request for selecting solutions to this particular problem, because the results of the type ‚Äúuniversal keyboard drivers‚Äù are somewhat different. <br><br>  The solution turned out to be very simple - the KeyTweak utility.  As I understand it, the home site is no longer there, but you can download it from a variety of software portals.  Installation is not required - which is generally correct, because, most likely, you will need to run the utility on a specific computer only once (well, or someone will be carried away by low-level key remapping). <br><br>  The essence of the reception is clear from the screenshot: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7s/oi/vz/7soivz43qsoc3vwo_fx_raj5v74.png"><br><br>  Simply replacing the low-level code of the left duplicating "slash" key with the low-level code of the left Shift.  Accordingly, pressing the backup key is now similar to pressing the left Shift. <br><br>  Configuration in the registry looks like this (you can do without the utility): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ow/g9/bb/owg9bbupr3fz84mqharuxy81aze.png"><br>  <i>(registry branch \ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SYSTEM \ CurrentControlSet \ Control \ Keyboard Layout)</i> <br><br>  Since this is a registry setting, the KeyTweak utility is no longer needed - this is not a driver, but just an interface for the convenience of such settings. <br><br>  Wherein: <br><br><ul><li>  nothing has changed with the left Shift itself; </li><li>  to press the left Shift, you can press it, you can press the "slash" alternate key, you can press both the Shift and the alternate at the same time - as if you are pressing the long left Shift;  the deputy perfectly participates in keyboard combinations (with Ctrl, Alt and others), similar to the main left Shift; </li><li>  nothing has changed with the right shift; </li><li>  nothing has changed with the right right-hand button with slashes (which is located next to Enter) - it both worked and works; </li><li>  tested not only on Logitech keyboards, but also on keyboards from several other manufacturers; </li><li>  the setting is done once on a specific PC; you do not need to do anything when changing the keyboard - if the new keyboard has a left sleshovaya key, then the setting is used if there is no such key (that is, left Shift is long), then the setting simply does not affect anything . </li></ul><br>  A note about the ‚Äúlocalized‚Äù keyboards is Logitech - as I understand it, the shortened left Shift is the problem of only localized keyboards.  For the same model, the Latin-only keyboard has a normal long Shift (see below for links to official photos), and a localized keyboard has a short one (all keyboards I refer to in the Russian retail have a short left Shift).  What is the depth of the design idea - I do not understand.  It goes without saying that there are exceptions - models of keyboards that have a long left Shift, regardless of internationalization. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Links</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="https://www.logitech.com/ru-ru/product/k750-keyboard%3Fcrid%3D27">www.logitech.com/ru-ru/product/k750-keyboard?crid=27</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.logitech.com/ru-ru/product/keyboard-k360%3Fcrid%3D27">www.logitech.com/ru-ru/product/keyboard-k360?crid=27</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.logitech.com/ru-ru/product/craft%3Fcrid%3D27">www.logitech.com/ru-ru/product/craft?crid=27</a> <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428950/</a></p>
