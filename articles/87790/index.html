  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The ban on hosting Kazakhstani servers outside the country has been lifted</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I learned the good <a href="http://profit.kz/news/005647/">news</a> that now sites on .kz domains can be officially hosted on servers outside the Republic of Kazakhstan.  This was done at the request of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Miklos Haraszti (thanks to this Hungarian writer).  As you know, Kazakhstan this year is the chairman of the OSCE and our government wants to comply with the rules of this organization.  Moreover, de facto, a lot of Kazakhstan sites are located and located outside the geographical borders of Kazakhstan.  From March 23, the new rules for the distribution of the domain space of the Kazakhstani segment of the Internet network will come into force, what they will bring to us will try to figure it out. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On the site is the institution ‚ÄúKazNIC‚Äù ( <a href="http://nic.kz/">nic.kz</a> ), which is the manager for the support of the top-level domain name KZ.  The latest news dates from February 1, 2007.  For three years, no changes in the rules, nor in the regulations and prices did not occur.  Apparently the new rules will appear there on March 23, after their entry into force.  The rules themselves were published in the newspaper "Legal Gazette" dated March 12, 2010 No. 37 (1833).  Incidentally, the aforementioned Miklos Haraszti requested to abolish this provision in 2005.  But then she was safely rejected.

      In fact, in Kazakhstan, this item of the rules was paid attention rather rarely.  It was easy to buy a .kz domain, register the ns server of the American hosting to it and use it without any problems.  Resorted to it several times to close the resources that are already very bright.  But still, having web hosting outside Kazakhstan, webmasters felt vulnerable.  And after the incident with torrents.ru, the owners of local resources, which are gaining momentum, became altogether scary. <br><br>  Here you need to say a few words about hosting in Kazakhstan.  If the Russian webmasters complain about the high cost of Russian hosters, then the Kazakhstani can only envy their envy.  Prices for hosting in the kaznet are much higher than the Russian ones and often for this money hosting is provided, to say the least, low-quality.  Recently, many webmasters, at their own request, began to transfer their sites to sites within Kazakhstan, due to the fact that traffic within the network of <a href="http://telecom.kz/">Kazakhtelecom JSC is</a> not charged and served at a higher speed than external traffic.  This is a great step for promotion of sites in the kaznet, since the Internet connection for most users is not very playful. <br><br>  From some points which should be noted in the new rules: <br><br>  <i>1) According to the amendments, the domain name registration is denied if there is an effective court decision banning the use of the domain name with the same <b>or duplicate name</b> .</i> <br><br>  How to interpret the phrase "duplicate name" is not entirely clear.  For example, is rutracker.org a duplicate name torrents.ru? <br><br>  <i>2) Not providing additional data;</i> <br><br>  Which ones?  Additional data in addition to the data specified when registering a domain or some other? <br><br>  <i>3) The court‚Äôs decision to suspend the dissemination of information posted on the Internet resource, which is <b>a mass media source</b> , prohibits the use of a domain name with the same or <b>duplicate</b> name <b>for up to three months</b> .</i> <br><br>  The rules were updated under the law, according to which any site in the .kz domain zone is a mass media.  Now sites like people can be deprived of liberty for dates =) By the way, again, the wording of the duplicate name is not very clear. <br><br>  PS If someone finds the new rules, or someone has ‚ÄúLegal Gazette‚Äù of March 12, 2010, No. 37 (1833), please share. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87790/</a></p>
