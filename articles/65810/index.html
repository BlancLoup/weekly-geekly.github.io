  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free second higher education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr√© like to be engaged in education and self-education, therefore, perhaps, this information will be interesting to someone ... Oddly enough, but I have not seen it on the Internet - obviously, self-interest and personal interest outweighs people, which, however, is quite understandable explainable.  :-) <br>  So, how can you get a second higher education in Russia on a budget basis? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And it is very simple - through admission to the magistracy.  Everyone knows that in our country so-called is introduced.  ‚ÄúBologna system‚Äù of higher education, when this education is divided into two stages - bachelor (3-4 years and free in terms of cost) and magistracy (2 years).  In parallel, there is still an old system of specialty (5 years and all that), according to which most of those who have already graduated studied ... Since all these systems are complex, they are introduced slowly and slowly, and as for cost, the magistracy was and still remains free for everyone.  From September 1 of this year, when the relevant amendments are introduced into the legislation, it will remain free for bachelors on a competitive basis, and for everyone else (read - specialists) will be paid.  Someone, perhaps, will ask - ‚ÄúWhat about us from this magistracy?  What does it have to do with a second higher education? ‚Äù  And everything is very simple.  Here are the main chips: <br><ul><li>  To enroll in the magistracy it is <strong>not necessary to</strong> be a bachelor / specialist in the same specialty at the same university.  It is enough to have <strong>any</strong> higher education in <strong>any</strong> specialty.  Of course, there are exceptions - some universities still require the presence of a first education in the specialty of magistracy - but these are exceptions.  The position of the overwhelming majority of universities is simple: because when you enroll in the magistracy you will pass the entrance exams, then once you have passed them, you have the right to study, and the fact that you used to be a lawyer and not a programmer is your own business. </li><li>  Yes, it is necessary to pass examinations after all - there will not be a completely complete freebie.  :-) However, the exams are quite adequate (they are designed for the fact that they will pass the bachelor's degree - that is, third-year students who have received some general concepts, but in fact have neither practice nor self-discipline - in a word, remember myself after the 3rd year ;-)) and already educated and responsible person will pass them easily and naturally after a week of preparation from scratch. </li><li>  As it was already said at the beginning - now the transition period is in the process of changing one educational system to another.  When it is completed, it may not be crowds, but quite tangible quantities of newly minted bachelors will be striving to get a master's degree.  Now the cat still cries for bachelors, but there are already magistrates (since the university can‚Äôt simply need to take it and introduce it abruptly - you have to create it in advance).  Therefore, the competitions in them are quite adequate, so that the chances of those who come with a different specialty increases. </li><li>  In the vast majority of universities, the process of master's education is similar to evening - 4-5 days a week, two pairs a day in the evening (usually from about 19 or so on).  Visiting after work is quite real.  But it is necessary to attend and learn at all, since the free magistracy is only full-time.  So, again, there will be no complete freebie.  All this lasts, I remind, 2 years. </li><li>  As a result of training in any master‚Äôs degree, a standard diploma of higher education in the relevant specialty with the qualification ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù is issued. </li></ul><br><br>  That's all, actually.  Personally, I myself found out everything and tested it on the example of Moscow, but this is in principle applicable to any state university, where there is a magistracy in general - you need to call the receiving commission, find out everything and agree.  In many universities, the examinations will be at the end of August and the reception of documents is currently ongoing.  So those who want to get a free second higher education have every chance to work out a little and successfully pass exams.  Let me remind you: next year <strong>there will not be</strong> all this freebies for specialists, so we need to seize the moment. <br><br>  PS: In the comments there were questions on deferments from the army.  I checked it according to the law - they give a deferment, but on condition that you entered the magistracy as a bachelor and immediately after graduation from a bachelor degree.  Those.  for professionals who aim to get themselves a second higher education this way does not apply.
