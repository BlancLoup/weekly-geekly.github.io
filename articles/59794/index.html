The business process of an Ethernet provider can be divided into the following parts: <br><br>  1. Registration of LLC, opening a bank account <br>  2. Obtaining communication licenses <br>  3. Designing a site <br>  4. Construction of a communication center <br>  5. Delivery of communication center in operation. <br><br>  Let us consider in more detail the points <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Registration Ltd. - you can arrange everything yourself, you can contact the consulting company that will do it for you.  Official expenses - 2000 rub.  state duty for registration of a legal entity (paid in savings bank) + 200 rubles.  for notarizing the signature on the application for registration of the LLC in the tax office.  And about 3000-5000 rubles more.  they will charge you to a consulting company that will draw up your documents.  To register an LLC, you must have a share capital of at least 10,000 rubles.  - it can be made both in money and in any property (office-computer equipment, furniture, equipment, etc.).  The official registration period for an LLC is 5 business days from the day the documents are submitted to the tax office.  Add here deadlines for preparing documents, notarizing the signature at the notary, and also for mailing documents if you do not want to use the services of consulting companies and stand in line.  The total is about 10 to 30 calendar days. <br>  After registration and receipt of constituent documents, you can make a company stamp and go to open an account in the bank.  Opening a bank account takes from 2-3 days to several weeks, the cost of opening and maintaining an account also varies. <br>  To open a bank account you will need notarized copies of constituent documents and certificates of tax registration and state registration. <br>  Cost: a notarized copy of the articles of association and the memorandum of association - 500 rubles each; <br>  certificates - 100 rubles each. <br>  Total: 700 rubles if the founder is one and your LLC does not have a memorandum of association and 1,200 rubles if there is one. <br>  Obtaining communication licenses - according to the Federal Law of the Russian Federation ‚ÄúOn Communications‚Äù, for the legal operation of an Ethernet provider, two licenses are required: a license for data transmission, with the exception of data transmission for voice information, and a license for telematic services.  The cost of registration of licenses - official fees: 300 rubles for consideration of one application for obtaining a license in the Federal Agency of Communications, 1000 rubles for issuing one license for one Subject of the Russian Federation (Total constituent entities of the Russian Federation according to the constitution - 89, for example to the whole of Russia - we multiply 300 * 89 + 1000 * 89 = 115700 rubles.) You can also issue documents for obtaining licenses yourself or turn to a consulting company.  In the latter case, you get rid of the need to study the rather intricate requirements for drafting an application for obtaining licenses, for describing the communication network and communication network diagrams, which are an integral and mandatory part of the application.  The deadline for issuing decisions on applications for licenses is about 40-50 days.  The cost of registration of documents for obtaining licenses from various consulting companies ranges from 6000r to 3000 $. <br>  After obtaining licenses, the telecommunications operator is obliged to start providing telecommunications services no later than the period specified in the license issued, using the communication center built and put into operation.  The process of commissioning a communications center is governed by the ‚ÄúRules for the commissioning of communications facilities‚Äù approved by Order No. 113 of the Ministry of Communications and Informatization of the Russian Federation on September 9, 2002 (they are often simply referred to as ‚ÄúOrder 113‚Äù). <br>  One of the mandatory points required when handing over a hub is the availability of a project for a communications hub that has passed a state examination at FSI MIR IT.  At this stage, it is worth noting that all the equipment used must have certificates of compliance with the CCC, first of all it concerns the server PD and TM services, Automated System of Calculations (Billing), UPS and channel-forming equipment. <br>  Also at the design stage, the location of the communication center and the organization of the line to the upstream provider should be determined.  The cost of the project site PD and TM services ranges from $ 1000 to $ 5000 and above, depending on the volume of design and equipment used.  Terms usually from 2-3 weeks and more depending on volumes. <br>  After the node has been designed and built, and its project has passed the state examination at FGU MIR IT, you can proceed to the acceptance of the PD and TM node of the services for operation.  This process is governed by 113 orders. <br><br>  Stages of acceptance of communication center in operation <br>  - notification of RosSvyazNadzor about the start of construction of a communication facility. <br>  - collection of necessary papers and documents according to 113 orders. <br>  - Notifying RosSvyazNadzor about the completion of the construction of a communication facility, with a request to appoint a representative of the RSN to the acceptance committee. <br>  - inspection of the PD and TM site of services, papers and documents by the RSN inspector <br>  - issuance of an operating permit. <br><br>  After obtaining a permit to operate, you can begin a legal activity! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59794/</a></p>
