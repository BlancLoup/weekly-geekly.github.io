  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Book microservices</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When the fashion for social networks appeared, when they had already entered our lives tightly, and their names flew from the mouth of everyone who had sat down at the computer at least once to get online, some went further than just searching for classmates.  Themed communities began to appear.  Including books. <br><br>  Initially, the user was offered functionality ‚Äî the more, the more interesting and sophisticated, the better.  But users are still ordinary people, and people always strive to simplify everything.  That started to appear projects that differ from their predecessors in simplicity, minimalism in design and capabilities.  And this story about them. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  One of the first ones I came <a href="http://bfeed.ru/">across</a> and immediately won my sympathy was the <a href="http://bfeed.ru/">bfeed.ru</a> project.  Bfeed has not so many functions: the service allows you to add books and evaluate them.  Evaluation is categorical - like or not like.  For non-readers there is a ‚Äúwant‚Äù button.  It is possible to add a comment or a short review (it is possible to add a link to the original).

      There is a bourgeois analogue - <a href="http://myfavoritebizbook.com/">My Favorite Business Book</a> , with a specialization, as the name implies, in business literature.  The idea is the same - added a book, left a comment.  Despite the overseas project, he is friends with the Russian language - at least, he understands.  And it also allows you to make a badge that can be published on your website / blog (the only service that offers similar functionality). <br><br><img src="http://read-only.org/uploads/images/3/b/b/3/1/a353ade5c9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The next book service is called <a href="http://bibla.ru/">Byblos</a> .  It is extra minimalistic, the design is almost completely absent.  As the creators say, Byblos is a service for bibliophiles that allows you to maintain a virtual library of books you read.  The user has the opportunity to add a book and write a note about it.  Books can be added from Ozon or Amazon.  No ratings.  However, you can mark the book "Read" or "I want to read." <br><br>  And one more service, about which I want to tell - <a href="http://librissimo.ru/">Librissimo</a> .  This is your bookshelf.  No ratings.  And it creates quite a big problem, it seems to me.  When adding a book, there are options - I read, I want to read, Read and recommend.  Here is the trouble in the last button.  The recommendation system is different from similar services, but its adequacy is questioned.  Well, what is not at Librissimo, but there are at the above mentioned services - rss-tapes of your books. <br><br><img src="http://read-only.org/uploads/images/8/2/0/e/1/3b5cdf2ef7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This concludes our short review of microservices.  Although here you can also include <a href="http://ivread.com/">I'vRead</a> , which is based on Twitter.  The essence of I'vRead is simple: just write a replay @ivread bot with the name of the book, and in a few minutes the cover of the book will appear in the service of I'vRead.  The service is looking for a title and a cover on Amazon, if there is no such book there, then only the author and the title are displayed (tested on Pelevin). <br><br>  So if you have memory problems and you can‚Äôt remember what you read, there are many interesting and different services that will help you save what you read and sometimes outline further goals. <br><br>  <a href="http://socialbook.read-only.org/258.html">Original of this article with minor additions</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71661/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71661/</a></p>
