Everything happens in the depths of corporations, dozens or even hundreds of people work on each model, and therefore it is extremely difficult to identify the logic of decision making.  The Huawei Ascend P6, which came to review, was also a dark horse until it was completely disassembled.  What we saw inside allowed us with the master Levchenko to present and record the history of the emergence of this complex apparatus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c68/8e2/ee8/c688e2ee8009dac0993385f777f0712c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, the spring of 2012, the center of Chinese Shenzhen, the headquarters of Huawei.

      Richard Yu, head of Huawei Devices, stood by the huge, full-length window of his office on the 36th floor and watched the sun go down.  He was, as usual, dressed in a jacket of protective color.  In the hands of Richard was a pipe.  At the round table, eighteen men in black suits sat tensely silent. <br><br>  Richard stopped looking at the red circle of the sun and turned to the crowd. <br><br>  ‚ÄúComrades,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI have the most unpleasant news for you.‚Äù  An hour ago, Tim Cook called me. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The office darkened sharply.  The silence has become frightening. <br><br>  - Tim brought our new smartphones and tablets.  In his opinion, they are suspiciously similar to the iPhone and iPad. <br><br>  All eighteen men simultaneously hit the table with their right hand.  One of them hissed: "Oh, big-eyed demons!"  Silence fell again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d4/131/a6c/4d4131a6c0dfc151f210f4d2df818fef.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Richard Yu in official vestments</i> <br><br>  - Tim said he would sue all the money to the last yuan.  I reminded him that at one time he served in the army with half of the Chinese General Staff.  And that factories where Apple products are collected can suddenly and for a long time become centers of military exercises.  And even nuclear tests.  In response, Tim calmed down a bit and agreed not to sue until the next generation of Huawei products.  And if it will be at least slightly different from Apple products, Tim will not recall the horde of his insatiable lawyers from the courts with Samsung. <br><br>  A general exhalation of relief passed over the table. <br><br>  - I have a question: can our designers come up with something unlike Apple?  We spent so much energy on the development of their ability to cloning and weaning from independent creativity.  Will the reverse process start?  Or should we prepare for war? <br><br>  Again a heavy pause.  Richard Yu walked around the table in circles.  All those who were sitting saw him step on a fluffy carpet with his coarse, well-worn crooked boots. <br><br>  A middle-aged man sitting in a far corner rose.  His stern face was scarred and his right hand lacked two fingers. <br><br>  - Do not worry, Comrade Yu!  As Mao said, there is power in the crowd.  Of course, some of the old people will find it difficult to go beyond the limits provided by the caliper.  But the youth will help them.  And we look.  We have eighty thousand designers.  Everything will be fine, Comrade Yu! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca7/f74/025/ca7f74025595c93eb3145499f0b18bf6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>A virtual camera takes us to a huge bright room with concrete walls and long tables.</i>  <i>Dozens of designers in identical gray blouses are concentrating on something on huge sheets of drawing paper.</i>  <i>In the silence suddenly shrill cry.</i> <br><br>  - Oh no!  Again!  Again this nightmare!  I can't live with this anymore!  Untie me from the table, I want to jump out the window! <br><br>  An old man in a work coat separated himself from the wall, holding a large rusty caliper in his hands.  He walked over to the young man, beating his head on the table, and asked in confidence: <br><br>  - What's the matter with you, young Liao, the best of the best? <br>  - Master Tsy, hit me with your formidable weapon, how can you do it!  I am a meaningless creature, like a toad with a head torn off!  I will never be a real designer! <br>  ‚ÄúIt is not yet time for you to experience the power of the smashing caliper, young Liao.‚Äù  Tell me what bothers you. <br>  ‚ÄúI can't help it, Master Tsy!‚Äù  For three months now I have been trying to draw something original, but I always get an iPhone.  I painted well-fed, hungry, drunk, in love, with a broken heart, with eyes closed, a leg, with a pencil holding my lips - and still the result is only HE.  Yesterday I bought Dr. Lee's powder from the skin of a mountain shtekogolovoy toad, added to it an elderberry extract, a few morels and an extract from the blood of a polar bear.  I was covered so that I forgot the name of my own mother and began to clearly see the third eye in the navel.  The substance is still valid, and I thought it would help me draw something unusual.  Feeling the magic on my fingertips, I with my eyes closed began to draw a shimmering image in the distorted consciousness and ... this is again the iPhone 4 !!!  Oh, strike me, Master Tsy and get rid of this flour! <br>  - Calm down, young Liao.  It is natural that you strive for excellence.  Terrible magic laid in the fourth iPhone wizard Steve, and his heirs still can not get rid of this confusion.  But I will help you, young Liao.  Look what I have. <br><br>  The old man took out a pink Chanel powder box and some old phone from his pocket. <br><br>  - What is it, Master Tsy? <br>  - This is a young Liao, a favorite female toy and the first mass touch phone LG KP500.  Take them, young Liao.  Drink more tinctures from the skin of a toxoid toad and forget the restless sleep, squeezing these items in your hands!  And the next morning you draw the glory of Huawei.  But it will be at night.  In the meantime, rest on the table, because the lock on your leg will open only at 20-00, and even my magic caliper cannot change that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/433/b89/c6b/433b89c6b89ce902d5f855af30495cea.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Not everyone knows what is behind the beautiful facades ...</i> <br><br>  The next morning, in the same room, everyone stood at attention, looking intently at the floor.  After eight minutes of silence, Richard Yu entered one of the eight doors in a jacket already familiar to us, puffing on a pipe. <br><br>  Without saying a word, he approached young Liao, looked into his eyes for eight minutes and then quietly asked: <br><br>  - Who helped you to draw our new smartphone? <br>  - I was instructed by Master Tsy, O great leader! <br>  - Master Tsy died today in a dream.  Now you are the chief designer of Huawei.  You managed what was previously thought impossible - to make a great smartphone, which on the one hand is not very similar to the iPhone.  You will assemble a new team and lead us to glory. <br><br>  Richard Yu looked at the rest of the audience in disgust. <br><br>  - And now ritual swords will be distributed to you and you will make a seppuku. <br><br>  From the far corner came a choked voice: <br><br>  - Great Yu, but we are Chinese!  The Chinese do not do seppuku! <br><br>  Richard Yu turned on his heels toward the voice. <br><br>  - You are right, the insignificant, whose name I learn only when I sign documents about the allowance for his family.  But you can even learn from enemies.  And even a moment before death.  Only in this way will we all succeed.  Hurry up after me, young Liao, and may your gaze not be defiled by what happens after we leave. <br><br>  Having said that, Richard Yu left the room.  In the tragic silence one could hear the young Liao speaking on the run: <br><br>  ‚ÄúComrade Yu, I‚Äôve also figured out how to avoid Apple‚Äôs unnecessary complaints about the design of the electronics of our future masterpiece!‚Äù <br>  - Well done, young Liao!  Now everyone will call you Sly Ive! <br><br>  <b>About smartphone</b> <br><br>  Huawei Ascend P6 presented in June, as the thinnest smartphone in the world.  The thickness of its body is only 6.18 mm.  Honestly, I don‚Äôt even know if someone has managed to do something more subtle or not.  In general, this craving to be the most-most even starts to irritate us somewhat, and, of course, irrespective of Huawei.  The best camera among the phones, the lightest weight among the representatives of the average price range, the most exorbitant price among the button phones (hello, Nokia!) And so on.  I understand that manufacturers want to ensure as many publications as possible in the press, which, by virtue of its laziness, will pay little attention to the not-very-most apparatus.  But one thing is a brief rattle in the news, and the other is real sales.  Marketers, of course, know better, but the absolute majority of people are body thickness to the bulb.  A couple of millimeters there, a couple here - who do they care?  Here is the battery life - it's interesting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/183/0be/c5a/1830bec5a6313e1fac2b3ff36002f715.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, we will not get ahead.  Let's look at the Ascend P6, just like a smartphone claiming a certain piece of market pie, not a record holder in chicken weight. <br><br>  To study, I chose a copy of a courageous pink color.  When you get one in public, men look slightly puzzled, and on the face of girls of all ages you can read complete delight.  Still, the guy with the pink iPhone!  The similarities with Apple products are impressive.  If you put an iPhone nearby, you can't mix Ascend P6 with it, of course.  But in the absence of the original, but from some distance, you begin to doubt.  It‚Äôs nice, of course, that the front camera was placed on the side of the speaker, not above it, and the main flash was not on the side, but on the bottom.  But the source of inspiration for designers is read unequivocally. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92f/c7a/0c5/92fc7a0c546a1ab4e83c909c11303ee5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Some disharmony in the design brings a rounded bottom.  There is a complete feeling that they added it at the last moment so that some lawyer from California would not stand.  Another version is purely technological limitations, which do not allow to achieve the required build quality and structural rigidity at an affordable price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b01/410/749/b014107490cee68237551cb8789a8931.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Unique photo!</i>  <i>In this perspective, Huawei Ascend P6 can not be confused with the iPhone!</i> <br><br>  In any case, the whole body is metal, of winged metal, and the bottom cap is plastic.  Build quality is not perfect.  Aluminum is aluminum, no squeaks and backlash to you, but the gaps on the right and left are slightly different.  And with a plastic cap docking is not perfect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c42/116/b60/c42116b605a7d4750c20b0ef5a52ccb5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The micro-USB connector is located on the top face, and not in the center, not on the side, but somewhere at the end of the second third.  Such a feeling that it somehow turned out on its own, well, and decided not to strain.  All control buttons and slots are located on the right.  There, and Power, and volume, and jacks for SIM cards and memory cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c0/af7/b05/1c0af7b05dcfccd0775f4eaae4bde8ef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Honestly, when I saw a pair of iPhone-specific slides with a hole for a clip, I thought that the device supports two SIM cards.  But no!  One of the slots for microSD, and go guess what - exactly.  To facilitate guessing games, the Original Clip Replacement is built into the phone.  It is pulled out of the Ascend P6 with difficulty, and in field conditions it is easy to drop.  But in general, of course, innovation is very violent.  When Master Levchenko and I understood the purpose of this small thing, we were silent for a minute in amazement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe6/f3c/c50/fe6f3cc50d8cacf0678f43301bc2ef6e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>At first I thought that we had a holder for the lace, like on the last generation iPod touch.</i>  <i>But no!</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73d/a40/43d/73da4043dffb7055c8be95a11664321c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Super tool</i> <br><br>  The diagonal of the Ascend P6 screen is 4.7 inches, the matrix resolution is 1280x720 pixels.  No records, all within reason.  The type of matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãIPS, but the picture does not please with some special richness of shades, and the illumination uniformity is not perfect.  The picture looks slightly "cartoon", coarse.  When the viewing angle changes, the tones remain the same, but their saturation is significantly reduced.  In general, from which side do not look at the screen, you will see a pretty strong middling, but no more. <br><br>  Like other great companies, Huawei is trying to use in its SoC smartphones.  In this case, this is the Huawei HiSilicon K3V2E with four cores and a peak frequency of 1.5 GHz.  The graphics core, however, is not its own - it was made by a little-known (for now?) Company Vivante.  The processor is made on a 40-nanometer process technology, and this is not very good news.  In fact, we are talking about the generation before the production lines, because Samsung, Apple and Qualcomm have long ago mastered 28 nm, and even in the last generation they had 32 nm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84a/d36/729/84ad36729e0e77bf40618a1e2e9c262c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is not good news.  Firstly, the system is not very fast - in synthetic benchmarks it is significantly inferior to previous generation smartphones, like the Samsung Galaxy S III or HTC One X. Secondly, the device heats up very much, both from the back and from the front.  Seriously, this is the first case in my memory when the smartphone screen becomes hot while playing a game.  The hand, of course, will not burn, but the feeling is strange.  Fortunately, most of the time SoC operates at 200 MHz.  It is interesting that, despite the 200-MHz step, the processor has only two main operating frequencies - 200 MHz and 1.2 GHz.  All others are rarely used.  And the strongest impression was made by the availability of operation at 1399 MHz and 1400 MHz.  One megahertz, it turns out, and in our time solves a lot. <br><br>  The stated amount of RAM is 2 GB, but all diagnostic programs report the presence of only 1.69 GB.  Whether the rest is overclocking the graphics accelerator, or the chips have been laid down this way, but the fact remains.  However, this volume is quite enough.  The user also has about 5 GB of onboard flash memory, and for everything else there is a microSD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/646/d94/281/646d94281a7657ce8e55580bfe2e47bb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I would be glad to say something good about the camera, but, alas, I cannot.  The point, of course, is not the resolution of the matrix, because 8 megapixels is enough for a smartphone.  It was the quality of the pictures that upset me.  No working out of details, narrow dynamic range, loud noises that appear even on a sunny autumn day, fierce shag ... Even Fly Phoenix doesn‚Äôt claim anything much better, but Ascend P6 is the flagship in the line of the company that ranks third in the world in sales smartphones.  In response to claims to the main camera in Huawei, they say: "But then we have a front resolution of 5 megapixels!"  The argument is, of course, powerful.  The only pity is that my face doesn‚Äôt get better over the years, and even 2 megapixels are a bit too much for her. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/991/fe4/e64/991fe4e64bce6005b737feef9a6ee227.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/624/621/227/624621227cc894d88c55a88a0dd088f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee6/9aa/3fa/ee69aa3fa548d32b8129d67e544e5f70.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c79/534/c86/c79534c86bf1ebfc5cfab3bfb627fc39.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/341/b01/e26/341b01e2671fed8adf1c6ce3a9796932.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  More sample photos in original resolution <a href="http://files.mail.ru/0F02DE892F4E442783519EA6D356EB2E">can be downloaded here</a> . <br><br>  The radio module is stable and good.  For mobile networks, the smartphone keeps tight, connects to WiFi at speeds up to 150 Mbps.  LTE, however, does not support, but even the top Samsung SoCs have not really learned yet.  Excusable. <br><br>  The battery capacity, despite the thin case, is quite decent - 2000 mAh.  The operating time depends on the usage scenario very much.  If the device is in your pocket, and you are talking mostly on a Bluetooth-headset, the charge will last for two days.  And even three.  If you constantly look at the screen and launch some applications, you will be asked to charge it at seven in the evening.  Unfortunately, the built-in means of informing about battery operation write some kind of nonsense, and you cannot trust them.  Therefore, I rely solely on my own observations. <br><br>  We will return to the hardware and similarity with the iPhone when we start digging into the insides of the Ascend P6.  In the meantime, as a smoke break, a few words about the software part. <br><br>  <b>About software</b> <br><br>  By turning the Android into Huawei, they approached very thoroughly.  If you do not know that this is the platform of Google, you can first and begin to doubt.  Were not too lazy to not only redraw almost all icons again, but also to get rid of the submenu with applications.  Is it as usual?  There are desktops, there is a dump of applications, from which the best can be pulled up.  There is no dump here.  All application shortcuts immediately fall on desktops, of which the default is four pieces.  To restore order, you can create folders and put in them.  If all does not fit, the number of desktops can be increased. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a8/9af/2bb/1a89af2bbe637c7add4fb7bee40c3639.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/209/250/fc1/209250fc1d8aec563a532e9550d640c3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are plenty of different themes for registration, and you can both install the official ones already registered in the smartphone and download home-made products from the Internet.  Both those and others look surprisingly neat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f9/831/4fc/6f98314fc4052f03ac637f6361d0129c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By default, all standard Google tools, the Polaris Office 4.0 office suite, and several proprietary applications, such as backup utilities, are preinstalled.  Some kind of megapriblud, which are famous for the Korean flagship, is not here.  Everything is very concise and to the point.  And this is good. <br><br>  The video player is not very happy with the omnivorous: like the analog in the Sony smartphone, it reproduces almost any picture, but ignores sound tracks.  All this is quickly and easily treated, and yet leaves a feeling of flaw. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the device cannot boast of excellent stability.  Whether in the processor case, or Android 4.2.2 sharpened too hard, but applications periodically freeze, and those of them that have not hung anywhere and never.  It seems like the Screen Test utility, which does not require any special permissions to work at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5d/e96/7e8/e5de967e801f6c4325900780d46c34d4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>A fun battery informant.</i>  <i>In his opinion, the charge appears by itself.</i> <br><br>  Minor flaws also emerge, such as the flight of the camera shutter button when changing the portrait mode to the panoramic one to the opposite end of the screen.  All this, of course, is treated in firmware updates.  But behind the efforts and diligence of the developers, not enough pumped karma in this business slips.  A good smartphone is like an English lawn: it must be cut for several generations in order to be good in the end.  Chinese masters are striding into the future by leaps and bounds.  But some trivia do not keep up with them ... <br><br>  With devices from the Middle Kingdom it happens that the software is not very, but the hardware is luxurious.  And if you don‚Äôt be too lazy to pick up smart firmware, for a humane amount you can get a great machine.  Let's see what is hiding inside the Ascend P6. <br><br>  <b>Internal organization</b> <br><br>  The most difficult part in the analysis of the Ascend P6 is to understand how the plastic rounding off the bottom snaps off.  After that, the back cover moves on the slide, and in front of us opens the view of the motherboard with the battery.  And immediately there is a feeling that somewhere we have already seen it ... Master Levchenko lays down the iPhone 4 side by side, and the question from sources of inspiration is immediately removed.  Of course, the Ascend P6 is made simpler and cheaper, but there are too many matches to be random. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/399/575/e64/399575e6442fa4ba49651013ae5ae08f.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/851/12b/687/85112b6872c71c8f331e99943ea19073.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  True, the location of the components of the Huawei smartphone is very peculiar.  It seems that the iPhone 4 motherboard was placed in front of a mirror, and it was copied from the reflection.  Whether it was so or not, I don‚Äôt know.
