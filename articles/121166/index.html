  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Without Agents.com - Is it possible to rent / rent an apartment without intermediaries?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Seeing once again the headline with the mouthworn phrase "without intermediaries" in the head may be thought - how, again?  How much can you produce such services?  Do not rush to conclusions. <br><br>  Before writing the article, I read all the articles on this topic on Habr√©, and most projects have one common feature - they all try to filter out agency ads from ads added by the owners.  Introduce black lists of realtors, store the filled database of agent phones, use filtering algorithms.  How effective are these methods?  Having checked about a hundred ‚Äúfiltered‚Äù ads, it seemed to me that the effectiveness, to put it mildly, was not up to par. <br><br>  In this article I want to share my approach to solving the problem of removing intermediaries from the tenant-landlord chain. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For many authors of similar projects, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreation was provoked by the unsuccessful experience of finding an apartment.  In my case, the catalyst was an attempt to rent out my own apartment without intermediaries.

      I will not go into details, but, without weakly worn out and almost changing the phone number, I began to think about the possibility of creating a project that would allow the landlord to minimize contact with agents and give a 100% guarantee for the tenant that the option of interest from the owner. <br><br>  Since I did not find a working method for filtering ads, I decided that the only right decision would be to immediately prohibit adding ads to agents.  The decision on how to do this was found - to confirm that the apartment in your property you need to take an extract from the register of property rights.  The obvious solution, right?  But not without flaws.  I started digging in this direction and it turned out that since May of this year, in all regions of Russia, it is possible to order and receive an electronic extract from the register of property rights.  Yes, this is what you need, I thought, and climbed onto the <a href="http://portal.rosreestr.ru/">Rosreestr portal</a> .  It turns out that without getting up from the computer, you can order an extract and pay a fee to receive it, which is only 150 rubles for individuals.  The finished statement certified by a digital signature (EDS) can be downloaded from the link after it is ready.  By law, the production time is 5 working days. <br><br>  Everything seemed fine except for one moment.  Users are unlikely to want to pay 150 rubles, which means that it is necessary to somehow compensate for the costs of getting an extract.  It was not possible to pay out of pocket, so a commercial access and the following scheme was invented.  The landlord will receive 50% of the money received from the sale of commercial access, which lifts a 2-week moratorium on the possibility of contact with the landlord.  <i>It seems that with a high level of popularity of the site, landlords can get much more than 150 rubles spent on getting an extract.</i> <br><br>  The second problem is that the problem of endless calls from agents is resolved with the help of a private messaging system.  Publication of contact information in the ad is prohibited.  But if there is a desire to talk on the phone, then you can exchange numbers with the help of drugs. <br><br>  The project <a href="http://bezagentov.com/">Without Agents.com has</a> just turned a month.  During this time 2 apartments were rented.  Another one is still vacant (Mytischi).  Yes, a little, but for now this is all what you can boast of. <br>  Another previously underestimated fact became obvious - those who donate an apartment do not want to wait for receiving an extract, and having placed their version in open areas, they will start receiving calls almost immediately.  But this problem is temporary and it will cease to be so when the issuance of statements will switch to a fully automatic mode. <br><br>  I will be glad to constructive criticism, comments and in general any opinion on the topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121166/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121166/</a></p>
