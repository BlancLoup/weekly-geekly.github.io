      Many web studios on their websites tell how much they pay attention to their clients, how they develop a project in stages, how many specialists work on the project at the same time.  By this they are not least motivated by the difference in price between studios and freelancers.  But let's compare how much what is told to the customer (and for which he, in fact, pays money), and what really happens during the development period. <br><br>  I want to clarify right away what is described the situation, which mostly concerns small studios, which have a certain package of orders and no name on the market. <br><br><h4>  And so, what is told to the client: </h4><br>  Stages of site development: <br><ul><li>  We learn all the information from the customer, highlight specific advantages over competitors, think over the logic of the future site together with the customer </li><li>  We develop a technical task, a prototype site.  We think over the future functionality </li><li>  After the approval of the TK and the prototype, we return the design to development.  All pages for drawing are known, the functionality is clearly described in the statement of work. </li><li>  After the approval of the design typeset and give to programming.  The layout is identical to the layout, it goes without saying </li><li>  Programmers strictly follow the technical task, it is not difficult, because the design reflects all the functionality </li><li>  Run the site on the test server.  We test for compliance with TZ and the presence of bugs </li><li>  Fully functioning site is uploaded to the server of the customer.  The site is ready </li></ul><br><br>  Everything is fine, at least 5-6 people work on the site.  The customer understands that knowingly pays a lot of money, everything should turn out well. <br><br><h4>  What happens in life: </h4><br><ul><li>  The customer comes to the web studio to order the site.  The manager is almost immediately interested only in signing the contract, but not in the successful delivery of the project. </li><li>  The technical task is drawn up in some way, and in the minimum form necessary for signing the contract.  All functional description is reduced to standard modules. </li><li>  The project is given to the designer with a minimum technical task.  For all questions the designer sent to the customer.  The customer does not understand what they want from him, because he has signed a technical task, there seems to be all the functionality described there.  Design somehow argue with a huge number of edits </li><li>  After typesetting, the design is ‚Äúslightly‚Äù different from the approved one.  The layout designer decided to slightly increase the font, because  "Too small" </li><li>  Programmers do their work strictly by design, because  There is really no information in the TK. </li><li>  Everything is uploaded to the test server, the programmer says that everything is ready, although the jambs in the work are obvious.  The programmer refuses to test, because  he is "not a tester."  The manager recalls that the customer wanted additional functionality, which was forgotten to clarify in the TK.  The programmer requires that this be reflected on the design.  The project returns to the designer (this item can be repeated a number of times) </li><li>  With some delay or without it, the project surrenders.  Developers hate each other, spit on managers, managers got their profit, and proceed to the next project ... </li></ul><br><br>  Familiar situation, is not it?  If not, then you can only rejoice. <br><br>  But here's a question for the community: <br><br><h4>  How to solve this problem? </h4><br>  When managers do not care about the project, and the team wants to quickly surrender it and forget it, like a bad dream.  How to motivate managers and the team to develop projects with high quality? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130200/</a></p>
