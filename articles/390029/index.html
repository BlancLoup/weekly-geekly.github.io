      Moreover, one of the oldest and most popular trackers, unsinkable by The Pirate Bay, also quickly organized support for the plugin in its search engine. <br><br><h4>  Background </h4><br>  Popcorn Time originally appeared as a client for downloading torrent files with an integrated media player.  Since most of the users are interested in torrents with video files (movies and episodes of serials), it was quite logical to expect the appearance of similar software. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the same popular uTorrent, the support for issuing a video stream in the process of downloading a torrent has been implemented for quite some time - but to view it, installation and configuration of a separate media player were required.  Here, everything you need is already delivered out of the box. <br><br>  Naturally, such a convenient thing could not fail to attract the attention of rightholders, who received more than one nightmare, trying to eliminate this threat to their income.  The gang of copyright holders MPAA (American Film Association), well-known for its cruelty, in 2014 managed to close the original version of the service. <br><br>  But since the source code of the program was available to everyone, versions of the service periodically appear again and again, in the manner of the heads of the mythical hydra.  The last of the most popular services, Popcorntime.io, was closed in November 2015. <br><br>  The developers of one of the ‚Äúpopcorn‚Äù variants from the <a href="http://popcorn-time.se/">Popcorn-Time.se</a> domain <a href="http://popcorn-time.se/">spread</a> out and refined the application so that it supports Windows, OS X, Linux, Android, iOS, embedded VPN support and even Chromecast and Apple TV. <br><br><h4>  Plugin: included and see </h4><br>  But now the right holders are faced with such a nightmare, from which they can not wake up.  Popcorn-Time.se no longer offers to download and install the application - just install the Torrents Time browser plugin, and you can watch any video files from torrents right on the page. <br><br>  At the same time, the code for the Torrents Time plugin is available on <a href="https://github.com/PopcornRepos/PopcornTimeOnline">GitHub</a> , which means that anyone can either help with the development of the system or install it on their hosting. <br><br>  The plugin is available for Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox for Windows 7 OS (and above) and OS X 10.8 (and above).  It supports Chromecast, Airplay and DLNA and has built-in support for VPN.  Developers offer a paid service <a href="https://www.anonymousvpn.org/">Anonymous VPN</a> , but no one bothers to use any other. <br><br><h4>  Pirate Bay </h4><br>  Typically, river flows into the sea, but by entering the pirate bay of The Pirate Bay, you can find streams flowing from it.  And now access to these streams is simplified to impossibility - <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-transforms-into-the-worlds-biggest-streaming-site-160205/%3Futm_source%3Dfeedburner%26utm_medium%3Dfeed%26utm_campaign%3DFeed%253A%2BTorrentfreak%2B%2528Torrentfreak%2529">site administrators added support for</a> the Torrents Time plugin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1f/3bf/3d2/a1f3bf3d275f39524cf3ffbaa2d99e22.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now the link ‚ÄúStream It!‚Äù Appeared next to the link for magnet, clicking on which you can download the plug-in, and launching it, start watching a movie. <br><br>  A simple, but with all the necessary functions, the player supports subtitles and casting for Chromecast, Airplay and DNLA devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f9/7e5/f6f/0f97e5f6fce519725b28558c5a713751.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Other great sites, such as Torrentproject.se, Videomax.is, Online.porntime.ws and KickassTorrents, have announced that soon they will also be able to use this plugin on their pages. <br><br><h4>  To say thank you </h4><br>  Mindful of the sad fate of the founders of other resources of similar subjects, the developers of the current version of Popcorn Time are making every effort to remain anonymous. <br><br>  It is only known that Popcorn Time and Torrents Time develop independent groups of programmers.  As the developers themselves write: ‚ÄúAdhering to anonymity, we do not turn out to be cowards hiding from monopolists who own content.  We are fighting for the free distribution of content.  We respect laws, but we don‚Äôt trust law enforcement agencies to implement laws. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390029/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390029/</a></p>
