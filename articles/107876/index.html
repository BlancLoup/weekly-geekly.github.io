They were invited, that is, there were no movements on our side.  Here we partly got into the stream (on the JTS there was a thematic week of techno-crash), the wow idea worked in part, although you can‚Äôt call it ingenious, of course. <br><br>  Since one of the founders had a certain experience in interacting with the media, the frank rake was avoided.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. <b>Quickly think, quickly do.</b>  Television workers are always very shybutnye - broadcast after 3 working days, and during this time you need to still have time to mount.  In our case, everything was somewhat complicated by the shooting studio in Moscow, and we have our headquarters in St. Petersburg, and some of the employees are remote and are further away from Moscow.  It was necessary to quickly motivate employees on a business trip, especially since the filming got on the weekend. <br><br>  2. <b>Paper man paints.</b>  In our case, the question of how far we will go, and the shooting will be broken for some reason, was relevant.  Therefore, it is better to ask the following piece of paper - it confirms some obligations and even if the shooting does not take place, then from the point of view of PR it can be useful later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/956/e35/804/956e35804ec4103284f13e91f65b04ee.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  3. <b>TV without "wow" does not live.</b>  It should be understood that, in terms of format, most TV programs do not imply depth, even if the program is thematic.  ‚ÄúWow‚Äù far outweighs the immersion into the depth of the issue.  In our case, the producer immediately caught fire and offered to carry out a full test cycle, but when he learned that it took four full working days, he immediately became sad.  Thus, it is necessary to prepare in advance for them the feeding of the most interesting facts, personnel, etc.  In the Technocrystal, everything was somewhat complicated by the fact that there is an emphasis on the thoroughness of the tests rather than on entertainment (for the latter, <a href="http://technocrash.ru/my/">contests of the ‚Äúnational crash tests‚Äù</a> are held separately), but some interesting things were dug up. <br><br>  4. <b>Equipment.</b>  In our case, it is and carry it problematic.  I had to quickly make mobile versions.  However, they are obviously useful again and again. <br><br>  5. <b>Do not wait for mega-attendance.</b>  ‚ÄúInfomania‚Äù at 00:30 weekdays is, of course, not a transfer for housewives at 11 am on Tuesday, but also not ‚ÄúGalileo‚Äù on Sunday prime time.  As can be seen from the graph, attendance growth went, but it coincided with the publication of <a href="http://technocrash.ru/2010/10/27/krash-test-mobilnogo-telefona-htc-desire/">the resonant HTC Desire test</a> , so it is difficult to make definite conclusions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c62/a41/03c/c62a4103c5da0a9b8a7add268dc97aba.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In any case, it is obvious that some% of the increase in terms of brand awareness has occurred.  For us, the formation of the ‚Äúcrash tests of mobile devices‚Äù market itself is also important, and this probably also helped.  A certain percentage of those who looked at the transfer and even those who did not immediately go to the site could later recall "about something like this" when choosing the next phone. <br><br>  By the way, here's the video transmission itself: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/r9_t620rV1U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhHFEX4_vaYcr_oCw_BkB6aOEjMCw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  C 17 min 02 sec ‚Äúbegin‚Äù we. <br><br>  6. <b>Travel of such travel.</b>  It is better not to save on motivation, otherwise item 1 will be difficult to accomplish. <br><br>  7. 2 minutes  17 seconds of free shooting save $ 19,166. <br><br>  About the ability to speak, the presence of prepared phrases, etc.  speaking meaningless - this applies to any presentations / speeches. <br><br>  PS Here, by the way, still a brief mention of the project in the Federal News.  Trifle, but with a logo in the corner is especially nice: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/videos%3Fvid%3D306254%26cid%3D1">http://www.vesti.ru/videos?vid=306254&amp;cid=1</a> <br><br>  We hope that this short article was completely useless for competitors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107876/</a></p>
