  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smartphone, are you all right?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, I got another device based on the Android platform.  Not that I was engaged in reviews of gadgets and quite a lot of them passed through me, not that I would repair them, and all the devices that passed through me would have been knowingly with a marriage, no.  But despite this, I have to state the fact that all, even new, devices over the past 5 years that have fallen into my hands on the setup had some flaws. <br><br>  And the flaws were the most different - problems with the case, the battery controller, the driver modules and sensors, embedded applications, the collapse of Google Apps is generally a common thing.  And not only cheap Chinese smartphones are susceptible to this, the period of support for which ends earlier than the devices fall on store shelves - even the flagships of well-known brands sin this. <br><br>  In general, I caught myself thinking that <em>on any</em> device that fell into my hands would not be such that <em>everything</em> worked fine.  Therefore, this survey may be interesting to many, to understand how everything is good / bad in the market of Android-smartphones.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Before the survey, let's define what ‚Äúeverything works‚Äù, which means that after buying a phone: <br><br><ul><li>  You never had to look for a solution to a specific problem for your particular device model on sites like w3bsit3-dns.com and xda-developers. <br><br></li><li>  you have never crashed any of the standard applications in the firmware <br><br></li><li>  You do not have any optimizers, cleaners, advertising applications in the standard firmware, which periodically suggest you do something through notifications or popups <br><br></li><li>  your phone does not lose touch during the day, lying in place in sight of the base station (that is, if there is a second phone nearby, then it should lose touch with the first one, ensuring that the link fell off not because of the first phone) <br><br></li><li>  backup and restore works <br><br></li><li>  calls, sms, mms, contacts and everything connected with them work. <br><br></li><li>  the proximity sensor works (it turns off the screen so that you don‚Äôt press too much during a call) <br><br></li><li>  photos are saved to the sd card and this setting is not reset after a reboot <br><br></li><li>  The battery charge is displayed correctly: there are no sudden failures of 10-20% per minute, the phone can work with a charge of 15% for at least 5 minutes. <br><br></li><li>  when the smartphone is charging, there is no external bounce in the headphones, and the touch does not start to ignore / make arbitrary presses. <br><br></li><li>  sticking and hauling headphones works correctly - the sound passes into them and back. <br><br></li><li>  volume control works smoothly, not only in two modes: turn off and very loud <br><br></li><li>  auto update works correctly <br><br></li><li>  With a large load, the phone does not hang from overheating and does not start to fail <br><br></li><li>  GPS works out of the box - without dancing with the engineering menu and YGPS <br><br></li><li>  the camera is running HDR and autofocus, if they are declared. <br><br></li></ul>  Why options are such?  These are the most frequent problems that came across to me and which are discussed on w3bsit3-dns.com for a wide variety of devices. Answers will be given below, but there will be no separation between Chinese and traditional brands - they still take spare parts for phones from some manufacturers, and they often gather for same factories. <br><br>  And here are the answers: <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395833/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395833/</a></p>
