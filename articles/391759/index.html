Yes, the very community that ‚Äúlights the stars‚Äù, launches the <a href="http://cosmomayak.ru/">satellite ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù</a> , lectures on cosmonautics to everyone from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok and does many more, we think, useful things for educating young people, promoting space research, promotion and development of private and commercial space. <br>  Our project, as you understand, is not a commercial project, but is an exclusively social initiative. <br><br>  Actually, the <a href="http://www.your-sector-of-space.org/index.php/projects/izdanie-knigi">fundraising campaign</a> itself, and this is the only stage where commerce manifested itself, is already considered completed and the project has taken place, the 100% level has been passed a long time ago, but the team decided to raise the bar for a few days remaining to be said, increased obligations - to increase the circulation, which we plan to donate to libraries and educational institutions.  And at the beginning I will tell in detail about the book itself, and at the end I will share some accumulated experience of social crowdfunding. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sometimes there are people who are not only not indifferent to high technologies, which allow airplanes not to fall, but also plow the spaceships into the Universe, but who live their work sincerely and also sincerely present the results of their work to people, helping them take another small step forward the ladder of the universe and seeing this as the true purpose of the scientist. <br>  One of them is Viktor Ivanovich Sidorenko, a veteran of cosmonautics.  In the recent past, he is a mechanical engineer for aviation and liquid-jet engines, a leading engineer and designer for particularly complex developments. <br>  Viktor Ivanovich presented his many years of experience in scientific and creative work on the pages of the book ‚ÄúIntroduction to Aviation, Rocket and Space Technology‚Äù.  It was published once by the author in tiny copies of 40 copies, which instantly sold out to colleagues, friends and educational institutions.  And at the moment, Viktor Ivanovich has only one copy left, in which he conducts classes and lectures for young people. <br><br>  The book turned out to be special.  In terms of the style and content, comfort and usefulness of reading, I position it between the books <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/projects/149141/izdanie_knigi_venera_neukrotimaya_planeta">‚ÄúVenus - the indomitable planet‚Äù by</a> P. Shubin and the <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/936387/">‚ÄúReference book on elementary mathematics‚Äù by</a> M. Ya.  Profitable.  It (the book) is read a little less exciting than ‚ÄúVenus ...‚Äù, because it does not contain obvious artistic digressions from the exact sciences, but in terms of simplicity and pleasant reading, it is very similar to Vygodsky, which is essential for a good teaching aid.

      Those over the age of 50 will surely remember this wonderful math reference book, which made it possible to successfully prepare for the entrance exams to the university.  And if anyone has the opportunity, I highly recommend that you find it in your home library on any second-hand books.  It is possible that with proper presentation of the material, if not for yourself, then for children or grandchildren, this copy will become a good reference book for several years. <br>  - No, son, it's not in ePub, it's in paper ... but it's worth it! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/991/c33/0e7/991c330e79fcbaac152fc9185b326e64.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúVenus is an indomitable planet‚Äù Habr's readers also surely remember well.  Published also with the help of crowdfunding, this book is distinguished by a large amount of previously unpublished information, from which the ‚ÄúSecret‚Äù stamp was removed especially for this edition.  And now the author is preparing a second book from the promised series, about the exploration of the moon ( <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/projects/149141/izdanie_knigi_venera_neukrotimaya_planeta/posts/15311">news number 44</a> ). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/884/598/3cd/8845983cd23507676411426a69b53f51.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For those who are not familiar with either the first or the second book, I‚Äôll give a few comments from students of Viktor Ivanovich, of different age groups, in order to just feel what is being said. <br><br>  This is what Sergey Kogan, a fifth-year student of FACI-MIPT, thinks about the book of the Physical and Technical Institute: <br><blockquote> <i>This book describes the physical principles of aviation, rocket and space technology, shows the device, purpose and characteristics of the best examples of these types of technology, gives the history of the development of each of these industries.</i>  <i>In each of the four chapters ("Aviation", "Rocket technology", "Spacecraft" and "Aerospace Systems"), the author consistently goes from simple to complex, starting with the basics and ending with the masterpieces of domestic technology and still unrealized projects .</i>  <i>At the same time, the author does not forget to briefly mention the main designers of various developments, their personal and professional qualities, the scientific and engineering schools they created, thus drawing the reader‚Äôs attention to the role that any particular person can play in the development of science and technology.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>This book has one more advantage: informational content, clarity of presentation and fascinating presentation of the material are harmoniously combined in it.</i>  <i>The author tells the complex things so simple and understandable that they become quite accessible to the student in understanding.</i>  <i>After reading it, he will be able to make a first impression about the aerodynamics of the aircraft, jet propulsion, the dynamics of space flight, as well as get acquainted with what engineering heights can be achieved with a deeper knowledge of these areas and a desire to create something with your mind and with your own hands .</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It should be noted that the book contains a large number of illustrations: diagrams, drawings, drawings and photographs, which not only greatly simplifies understanding and enlivens the narration, but also gradually forms an image system that is extremely important for a specialist (after all, EDUCATION is the formation of a system of ), in the framework of which he will carry out his professional activities.</i>  <i>At the end of the book provides a detailed list of symbols, terms, concepts and definitions.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Getting into the hands of a person interested in, the book will give not only a large amount of structured factual information, but, no less importantly, will saturate him with food for thought, infect the spirit of search and the thirst for creativity.</i>  <i>Regardless of the choice of future profession, such a powerful impetus will positively affect the personal qualities of the reader.</i>  <i>And if he is inspired by the greatness of our aerospace industry (which is not hard to do, taking into account the style of the book and real achievements), then from the school bench he will begin to comprehend with enthusiasm the basics of this kind of activity, a difficult but interesting science, supremely worthy to devote to her life.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Thus, at first technical universities, and then industry, will receive people not only well-trained, but also, and more importantly, people who know how to work and who want to create.</i>  <i>This is essentially a part of that global program to fill the acute shortage of talented scientific and technical personnel, the need for implementation of which several months ago (actually at the same time when the project for publishing the book, VI Sidorenko, was launched) was spoken by the adviser to the Russian defense minister graduate of the Physics and Technology Institute, Andrei Ilnitsky, first in his article <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/597164">‚ÄúThe Russian Battle of Sade‚Äù</a> , and then on the program <a href="http://radiovesti.ru/episode/show/episode_id/36614">‚ÄúPrinciple of Action‚Äù of the</a> radio station ‚ÄúVesti FM‚Äù.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Personally, I‚Äôm very pleased to give a few copies of the book to my younger comrades in the rocket model circle of my hometown.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  And reviews about the book and from the very young lecturer of Viktor Ivanovich - Victoria Surovtseva, 8th grade student: <br><blockquote>  <i>At the lecture of Viktor Ivanovich Sidorenko I learned a lot of interesting things.</i>  <i>For example, how to create weightlessness in earth orbit.</i>  <i>You know?</i>  <i>Not?</i>  <i>And I know!</i>  <i>It turns out that a spacecraft needs to develop the first cosmic speed - 8 km / s.</i>  <i>Then the force of removal from the earth and the force of balance are balanced, and weightlessness will result.</i>  <i>And in order to fly farther, it is necessary to develop the second cosmic speed - 11 km / s.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I also learned that there are airplanes that fly without a motor - gliders.</i>  <i>They have very long wings.</i>  <i>Gliders catch wings ascending air and take off.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It seems to me that if fate is favorable, and fortune smiles at me, then I will ask Viktor Ivanovich more than once for advice when I become a rocket technician.</i> </blockquote><br>  Amazing reaction ... <br><br>  I can not say that the book has a clearly-expressed artistry to excite the heart and mind like this.  But the effect of the lectures that are held on it is amazing.  Probably, and certainly this is the merit of the lecturer himself. <br>  But even more my attention is attracted by the fact that in a short period of time this second book (after ‚ÄúVenus ...‚Äù) is being published with the help of crowdfunding, i.e.  conscious prepayment by consumers of a particular product, and the main task of which is education in the exact sciences, and more specifically - aerospace. <br><br>  In general, we live in amazing times. <br><br>  Several decades ago, such work was carried out on the order of the state, in order to raise the general level of education and educate the population.  The works were issued for both ‚Äúphysicists‚Äù and ‚Äúlyricists‚Äù, but personally two films for ‚Äúphysicists‚Äù are especially valuable for me: ‚ÄúMathematician and devil‚Äù (1972) and ‚ÄúWhat is the THEORY of RELATIVITY?‚Äù (1964).  Although, as you can see, the ‚Äúlyrical‚Äù part is present in both films in abundance, obviously, to form a harmoniously developed personality. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/50hDd12-tEI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg5-kLfOOROGvGMSgR-pS7XOKYjbQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xtv1hVYLLaU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiakOMzBzCBVTiTGmBIqW4HS8V-AQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The cycle of lessons on the book of Viktor Ivanovich was warmly greeted at the Cosmonaut Training Center.  Yu. A. Gagarin.  The letter of appreciation of the Center states: <br><blockquote>  <i>"The book can play an important role in preparing the squad of talented, purposeful young professionals in the aviation, rocket, space and aerospace industries, without which the development of the country is impossible."</i> </blockquote><br>  The book is written not just by an expert in aerospace engineering, but by a man who has half a century of experience in this field.  Viktor Ivanovich participated in the creation of such masterpieces of domestic aerospace technology, such as a rocket booster for the MiG-19S interceptor fighter, the heavy Proton launch vehicle, the Almaz rocket and space complex supply ship, the reusable Buran orbiter (yes , the one whose layout flaunts on VDNH). <br>  In general, by participating in this project, we once again set ourselves and solve the problem of motivating young people to study the exact sciences (well, we are ‚Äúphysicists‚Äù;), to form specialized scientific personnel and try to help a person find and realize his vocation. <br>  We decided to print a good and, in our opinion, necessary book.  And there, you see, as in a parable, a drop to a drop - there will be a puddle, and from a puddle - a river, from a small river - seas and oceans.  So this book, we believe, will serve as an excellent impetus to science and engineering for people of any age! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ded/64f/b5c/ded64fb5c9904dc5ace068fd52317934.jpg"><br>  Now a few words about the process of crowdfunding on a very specific book - a training manual.  To his amazement, he turned out to be even more difficult than collecting money for our Space Lighthouse, which has one of the main purposes - to simply ‚Äúshine the brightest star‚Äù and excite hearts and minds! <br><br>  <b>From idea and plans to goals and results.</b>  <b>Normal flight</b> <br>  The printing fees for 1000 books were successful.  Therefore, we raised the bar from 1000 to 2000 copies. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/793/5d8/11a/7935d811a2a14142bd1ef5e094f1ae8f.png"><br>  We plan to donate books to more than 40 educational institutions throughout Russia.  You can send us your wishes, where else should direct the book.  Please, along with the name of the organization, and describe why there. <br><br>  <b>What did we start with, where did we get the knowledge, how did things progress</b> <br>  To advance in understanding how crowdfunding works in book publishing, the story on Habr√© Simple Science helped us.  We had everything in the same way - we fell asleep and woke up with VC and FB, leading endless correspondence with hundreds of stakeholders (interested parties).  We had to deal with a wave of mistrust, to explain that we are not advertising knives \ dolls \ souvenirs \ ... and, perhaps, the most difficult: we do not earn anything on this project.  Just volunteer and do our civic duty. <br>  Having prepared a text description, design, rewards, having passed the moderation of the crowdfunding platform, we are faced with the fact that after two months of long conversations, Viktor Ivanovich does not understand what crowdfunding is, that people donate money, etc. P.  It was the biggest crisis in the project.  Therefore, we advise you at the very beginning of the project not only to say in words what and how you are going to do, but also to fix this in writing for each participant.  At crucial moments, wasting time to detect and eradicate misunderstandings and forgotten duties is simply destructive. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/478/f0f/78d/478f0f78d0984bf29331dcd97e0cfede.jpg"><br>  This crisis has shifted our schedule two weeks ago.  But this is not the main thing, the main thing is that the thorns are over, and we still appeared on the crowdfunding platform. <br><br>  <b>Countdown, or a little about the math project</b> <br>  Not everyone with whom we initially agreed on info-support (one month before the start of the training camp) responded to new letters and carried out the promised actions.  Something broke at the last moment, something also unexpectedly was and succeeded.  Like fishing. <br>  After a week of active dissemination of information on the book, we reached 47% of the amount claimed.  It was Friday.  Honestly, it was difficult to achieve these 47%.  ‚ÄúOn Friday evening, people relax, fasting is ineffective,‚Äù all the admins told us.  It was the opposite.  Pecked like on weekdays! <br>  Each application for the book met stormy "Uraaa" and joy!  ‚ÄúPeople believe us!  Someone needs this, we are not alone on an abandoned island shouting into emptiness. ‚Äù  This is an invaluable motivator \ kick (as anyone). <br>  On the 13th day, the desired mark was reached - 100%.  100, Karl !!!  Joy and smiles in the dialogue of the project there was no limit! <br><br>  <b>And what's next, after a happy ending?</b> <br>  ... we thought for five minutes and decided that 21 days is enough time to set goal No. 2: to print 2000 copies.  books. <br><br>  <b>We share some insights for those who want to repeat something like that.</b> <br>  We admit that we did not set up control points, responsibility matrices, task deadlines, and the like, which are important for project management.  Although at some points it would help preserve the nerves.  Almost 90% of the team communication was in the general VK chat.  We never thought that VK could be an effective channel for attracting an audience, but it worked for us.  We had the most individual approach to all to whom we personally addressed.  The team has never (!) Gathered the whole together.  All of us had enough Google-tables with the state of negotiations with info-partners and Vlokontakte for current issues.  The only whip of motivation is that the hand of the initiator periodically punished them inactive and removed them from the dialog box (this really worked and forced them to work). <br>  As Denis (the author of the project) later admits, he wanted to try (and tried) a new management approach - Holacratie (Holacracy is a social technology or organization management system in which authority and decision-making responsibility are distributed throughout the holarchy (self-organizing team)).  For this to work in social projects, there must be periodic collective discussions of what needs to be done and the distribution of tasks.  And the most important thing: it is necessary that everyone become real enthusiasts and fans of the work that you do together. <br><br>  <b>Our optimistic plan</b> <br>  By May 9, we will try to print 1500-2000 hardcover books and send out to all participants of crowdfunding! <br>  In the meantime, our veteran of the aerospace industry, still fascinated by technology, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtransferring knowledge between generations, is giving open lectures for children and adults in Moscow and the region.  Even at Baikonur, there are lectures about aerospace technology based on his book! <br><br>  And finally, some links to the materials of the book itself: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://your-sector-of-space.org/pdf/chast_knigi_sidorenko_new1.pdf">a small introductory piece of the book</a> ; </li><li>  a short lesson recording of the book VI.
