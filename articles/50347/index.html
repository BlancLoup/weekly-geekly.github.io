Why?  If it was only a spelling error ... I can accept this.  For me, the main problem is the distortion of the <i>meaning of the</i> original. <br><br>  Translators are taught that it is not necessary to translate word for word, it is enough to convey the meaning.  I was informed about this by a wife who was a student of a linguistic translator after I poured out my soul to her about the quality of the translation.  Apparently, the translators have learned quite well what is not necessary to translate word for word, but what still needs to be conveyed and <i>meaning</i> ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  <b>Examples</b> </h4><br>  <b>Example One: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a> - <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/1657382/">Programmer-pragmatist.</a></b>  <b><a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/1657382/">The journey from the apprentice to the master</a></b> <br><br>  To start this book, I read a little in English in electronic form, after which I decided to buy a paper copy (it became more pleasant for me to read real books that I could hold in my hands), and I bought it translated into Russian.  Already in the 3rd section, "Cops of stones and cooked frogs," I felt that something was wrong.  But for starters, I‚Äôll give you the story of the soup, so that you know what it is about, and then we‚Äôll examine a paragraph full of errors: <br><br><blockquote>  Three soldiers returned from the war and got hungry.  When they saw the village ahead, their spirits rose - they were sure that the peasants would feed them.  But as soon as they arrived at the village, all the doors were locked, and the windows were closed.  After a long war, the peasants were in poverty and hid everything they have. <br><br>  This did not embarrass the soldiers, they boiled a cauldron of water and gently put three stones into it.  Surprised peasants came out to look. <br><br>  "This is stone soup," the soldiers explained to the peasants.  ‚ÄúIs that all you put in it?‚Äù Asked the peasants.  "Absolutely everything - although it will taste much better if you put some carrots in it."  One of the peasants ran away and quickly returned with a basket of carrots from his cellar. <br>  ... <br>  So they cooked a large cauldron of steaming soup.  Then the soldiers took out the stones and sat down with the whole village to eat their fill - the first time in many months. <br></blockquote><br><br>  And now the most interesting: <br><br><blockquote>  ... <br>  You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs to be done and how to do it.  Before the eyes there is a general plan of the system, and you realize that this is how it should be.  But if you ask permission to work out the aspect as a whole, you will encounter red tape and empty eyes.  People will form commissions, the budget must be approved, and everything will be complicated.  Everyone will hold on to their chair.  Sometimes this is called ‚Äúinitial fatigue.‚Äù  <b>It's time to pull the stones out of the boiler</b> .  Work out what you can really ask for.  Work out the details.  As soon as you do, show people and let them be surprised.  <b>They will say</b> : "Of course, it would be better if we added."  <b>Put</b> that is not important.  Relax and wait until they start asking you about adding functionality that you originally intended.  It is easier for people to join in the coming success.  <b>Show them the light at the end of the tunnel</b> , and they will rally around you. <br>  ... <br></blockquote><br><br>  And having felt this is the most amiss, I decided to once again look into the original, to make sure that either I was buggy, or the translation, as often happens, ‚Äúworked out‚Äù.  So, the original is called "Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs": <br><br><blockquote>  ... <br>  What is the situation?  The entire system just appears before your eyes.  If you‚Äôre not happy, you‚Äôll be able to find out.  People will form committees, budgets  Everyone will guard their own resources.  Sometimes this is called "start-up fatigue."  <b>It's time to bring out the stones</b> .  Work out what you <i>can</i> reasonably ask for.  Develop it well.  Once you have them, you can see them.  <b>Then they say</b> "of course, it was better ...."  You originally wanted.  People find it easier to join an ongoing success.  Get them to you. <br>  ... <br></blockquote><br><br>  So, in order: <br><ul><li>  <b>It's time to get the stones out of the cauldron.</b>  The authors of the original have in mind that it is time to get the stones (say, because of the sinus) in order to put them <i>in the pot</i> and start cooking the soup.  But do not pull them out.  This can be understood by the fact that after this phrase there is a description of the actions that form a parallel with the actions of cooking soup: work out, work out, show, and so on. </li><li>  <b>Then say - They will say.</b>  Hurt yourself!  I am sure you yourself will understand this mistake. </li><li>  <b>Pretend - Put.</b>  First, we do not ‚Äúput on‚Äù, but ‚Äúpretend‚Äù;  and secondly, do not ‚Äúpretend‚Äù, but ‚Äúpretend‚Äù (yes, it is you!) </li><li>  <b>Show them a glimpse of the future - Show them the light at the end of the tunnel.</b>  Um ... The first thought that creeps into my head is that the light at the end of the tunnel is seen before death.  Please, tell me, if I showed you the light at the end of the tunnel, would you have rallied around me or would you rather quickly send me to the next world?  One of my translations for this phrase is: ‚Äúshow them a glimpse of the future.‚Äù  But the translator, unfortunately, associates a glimpse into the future with light at the end of the tunnel.  Gloomy translator, gloomy.  Although I myself with such translation skills would also not be very happy life. </li></ul><br><br>  Dear readers, we have dismantled just <i>one</i> paragraph!  To manage to make so many semantic mistakes in one paragraph! .. <br><br>  Thanks to the translator for the fact that, at least, he didn‚Äôt think of renaming the section as ‚Äú <a href="http://www.skazki.org.ru/view.php%3Fid%3D7073">Porridge from the Ax</a> ‚Äù and didn‚Äôt replace the original text with the content of this tale. <br><br>  Maybe the author of the translation does, like my former colleague, who watches movies during programming by placing a small player window in the lower right corner?  Maybe this is what distracts him from thinking about the text and understanding its meaning?  If you are lucky to meet this translator, who, by the way, is called A. Aleksashin, do a favor, ask him about it - I will be glad to know about the veracity of my assumption. <br><br>  Having found so many mistakes at the very beginning of the book, I completely lost confidence in its continuation.  I thought that the translator could mislead me, so it all ended with the fact that I threw out the translation and ordered the original from Amazon.  (And maybe in vain, because during the crisis, it would be possible to save on toilet paper ...) <br><br>  How well it looks in the original!  The book, by the way, is a classic - one of those that should be read by any self-respecting programmer.  It is a pity only that the book reached its domestic masses in such a terrible form. <br><br><br>  <b>Example Two: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Leave-Stay-Step-Step/dp/0452275350">Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay:</a> - <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/2837436/">Leave or Stay?</a></b> <br><br>  Such a wonderful book, the author of which is trying to help you out of the uncertainty of your relationship - a state where you constantly revolve around the question: leave or stay?  She gives a description of the problem, asks you a question about this problem, gives real examples from the lives of people who have come to her for help, and, depending on your answer to the question asked, says: ‚ÄúBased on what she showed the experience of most people in your situation, your relationship is <i>too good to leave them</i> "or" As the experience of most people faced with a similar problem showed, they were happy to leave, and therefore I can say that <i>your relationship is too bad to them to stay</i> . ‚Äù <br><br>  There are 36 such questions, each of which is like a sieve: you go through each one until you get stuck in at least one.  If you have successfully answered the question, and your relationship is too good to leave, you move on to the next question;  otherwise, the book can no longer be read - well, if only out of curiosity or a desire to understand what should be in your relationship, and what should not. <br><br>  I read the book in the original, but when I told about it to one person who cannot read English, at his request I found a translation for him;  that is, I did not read the translation itself.  But it was enough for me to read only one name: ‚ÄúLeave or stay?‚Äù <br><br>  What's wrong with this title?  And the fact that the whole <i>essence of</i> this book is that your relationship is either <i>too good to leave</i> , or <i>too bad to remain in them</i> - the whole book is saturated with these phrases.  So the title of this book should have been translated: ‚ÄúToo good to leave;  too bad to stay. ‚Äù  I think the author of the original would be smart enough to call this book "Leave or Stay?", If it really reflected all its essence.  Indeed, in the title of the original laid the whole <i>point</i> !  It is impossible to simply take and take away from the book its main feature with such an irresponsible translation! <br><br><br>  <b>Example Three: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Employee-Month-Widescreen-Dane-Cook/dp/B000LC3ICE">Employee of the Month</a> - <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3100582/">Date of My Dream</a></b> <br><br>  A good film about the employees of the hypermarket, where during each month there are competitions for the best <i>employee of the month</i> ;  the translation of the name: ‚ÄúEmployee of the month‚Äù, or ‚ÄúEmployee of the month‚Äù, or ‚ÄúWorker of the month‚Äù should sound exactly like this. <br><br>  But be kind, explain to me, dear readers, by what logic it was possible to translate what should sound like ‚ÄúEmployee of the month‚Äù into ‚ÄúDate of my dream‚Äù!  Brilliant translation!  I understand that it is not necessary to translate word for word, but ... there are simply no words ... <br><br><br><h4>  <b>Finally</b> </h4><br>  I could cite many more examples of such a genius of translators, but I think that will be enough.  Judge for yourself how well our translators do their job.  But I made my choice: if possible, I read the original.  It is the original, and not only in English;  I recently read The Masters and Margarita and read in Russian, in the original. <br><br>  I still have only two languages ‚Äã‚Äãavailable: Russian and English;  therefore, if I want to read some of the works in other languages, first of all I will try to find the translation into English, and only in case of failure of the search will I decide to read the translation into Russian - if they cannot translate from English properly, what will happen? example, with Chinese or Japanese. <br><br>  I do not claim that all translations are bad.  There are good translations, and even excellent.  But I prefer to start from the original right away than to spend time figuring out the quality of the translation and extra money for something that can be thrown away very soon. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> If you, dear readers, have a desire to learn how I have mastered reading in English, I could write a separate post about this.  Desire please express in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50347/</a></p>
