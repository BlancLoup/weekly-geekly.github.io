New technologies at Eurovision, music and sports venues</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Whether you are a football fan or a music fan, you probably know the unique feelings of togetherness that arise when people get together to watch a great show on the big arena. <br><br>  However, the crowded stands and tens of thousands of spectators at the stadium can be one of the worst experiences, especially if you have to defend a huge queue at the entrance or in an attempt to buy drinks when you are already inside.  In this case, not only the spectators suffer.  Companies that operate stadiums also face problems, for example, when they have to deal with cash, manage the flow of people and resist hooliganism. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d4/bd8/5d0/7d4bd85d0c594b1892986e709e05f88b.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>NFC, mobile apps and intelligent event platforms provide the highest experience possible for viewers who enter the arenas.</b>

      But it is not at all necessary that everything will evolve according to this scenario.  With proper choice of technology, you can achieve a significant increase in security, increase revenue per site and get a better understanding of the needs of visitors, while the queues themselves will be a thing of the past.  Introduced Gemalto NFC technology, mobile applications and intelligent event tools are the foundation of the Allynis Smart Event Platform (ASEP) platform, which includes: <br><ul><li>  support of registered tickets and access control technology; </li><li>  support for both online payments (EMV) and prepaid payments (off-scheme); </li><li>  applications for transport system operators; </li><li>  social media contacts for a better user experience; </li><li>  real-time data collection and analysis; </li><li>  mobile marketing; </li><li>  and much more - while new features and capabilities are constantly being developed and added. </li></ul><br><h2>  Intellectual subscription </h2><br>  The opportunity to register all holders of season tickets in the program of an intellectual event would be useful both for the organizers and for the fans themselves, because it allows you to get rid of a significant part of the queues, get a more complete picture of attendance, increase the speed of service, and get the opportunity for branding - , organizing discounts at individual sellers or holding promotions. <br><br>  The presence of a bracelet with NFC support for each holder of the subscription will provide quick access to the event and the ability to instantly pay without using cash.  Mobile applications will provide them with everything they need - starting with the opportunity to check the balance and get a pass to the VIP-zone and ending with the pre-ordering of snacks and drinks in between the time periods and the search for their places.  All this means that you will be able to provide a much higher quality of service to your most significant fans at all home matches. <br><br>  Through the use of advanced NFC technology and specialized service system, Gemalto ASEP platform: <br><ul><li>  allows you to improve the quality of customer service during events; </li><li>  helps to increase revenue - both on the basis of existing sources of income, and from new sources; </li><li>  increases the level of public involvement and loyalty; </li><li>  helps to improve safety; </li><li>  ensures transparency of all financial transactions carried out at the site where your event is held; </li><li>  increases the importance of your event in a dialogue with partner brands. </li></ul><br>  Moreover, the platform allows you to simultaneously work with online payments using traditional payment systems, as well as with prepaid payments.  This allows teams to keep a significant part of the proceeds from the game in their own secure payment system operating at the stadium, while fans can perform regular contactless transactions using EMV cards from any retailer that supports NFC technology. <br><br>  The Allynis Smart Event Platform is already being implemented with great success in many stadiums and venues throughout Europe, including the Saracens Rugby Club in the UK.  Gemalto works with a number of the world's largest payment systems and financial institutions to deploy attractive products to support sponsored events. <br><br>  2016 will be the year of a real breakthrough for technologies designed for intellectual events and non-cash payments at stadiums.  Contact Gemalto to find out how to join the growing number of similar smart sites in the future. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WycnKVNRx0w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Russia is preparing </h2><br>  Russia is preparing for the World Cup in 2018, and it is necessary to think through the proposals for the technological maintenance of this great event, which more than a million people plan to attend.  We see a trend towards the emergence of ‚Äúcashless stadiums‚Äù using wearable contactless solutions capable of covering transportation, access control and payment services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a9/9cd/094/2a99cd0947b84582b6bf4de3cfe7e51a.png"><br><br>  In July 2015, Gemalto acted as a supplier of NFC technology for wearable payment devices at the Alfa Future People festival, the leading Russian festival of electronic music and technology, which was held in Nizhny Novgorod with the support of Alfa Bank.  As a year earlier, the festival became a territory of non-cash money, where guests had the opportunity to quickly and safely pay for purchases using contactless technology.  As part of this concept, festival visitors received a Welcome Pack with a bracelet for contactless payment of various purchases during the festival - drinks, food, souvenirs. <br><br><h2>  Final soon </h2><br>  Gemalto began working with Visa, one of the world's largest payment service providers, to provide visitors of the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 with bracelets for contactless payments.  The solution includes the personalization, packaging and execution of contactless wristbands and uses our Allynis Smart Platform Event platform for the prepaid payment program and event management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef4/31d/437/ef431d437b3341b9879ba7e985e49ec7.png"><br><br>  Contactless Visa bracelets are already available for purchase at Eurovision Village in Stockholm (Sweden).  This year the competition expects to attract up to 65,000 visitors who will gain experience using contactless devices.  The culmination of the event will take place on May 14 (this Saturday) during the Grand Final at the Globe Arena. <br><br>  Gemalto integrated solution gives Visa the opportunity to demonstrate contactless interaction in the business, including making a purchase without using cash or payment cards.  You can access account information in real time, including prepaid balance and information about previous transactions, through a website specially created by Gemalto. <br><br>  A modern and functional bracelet for making payments is equipped with a contactless chip from Gemalto and complies with the same security standards as a regular contactless EMV card that has been certified by one of the international payment systems.  Visitors could replenish the balance of the bracelet through the contactless terminals installed on the festival territory.  The bracelets are water repellent and resistant to damage.  Thus, they are optimally suited for active outdoor use during the Festival. <br><br>  In addition to the Eurovision site, bracelets can be used to make payments in any Visa POS terminal ready for contactless payments all over the world and will continue to operate after the show ends until October 31, 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a6/1b1/436/4a61b143692249d18f9c6ce478828fdd.jpg"><br><br>  Allynis Smart Platform Event can be used in conjunction with any form of payment, including wearable devices and mobile NFC;  This platform also provides payment management, access rights and work with an extensive portfolio of licensed applications.  The complete solution supports a rich set of features, including touch-and-go payments, easy access control to performance venues and places for recreation, as well as many other useful applications.  It improves and protects visitors, and also allows organizers and other interested parties to implement intelligent communications, marketing programs and loyalty programs that work before, during and after the events in real time. <br><br>  The Allynis Smart Event Platform (ASEP) platform, developed on the basis of our expertise in bank payment technology, product design and interactive events, is a special offer that helps our partners and customers gain greater control over their event or venue, by: <br><ul><li>  Enhancing the positive experience that customers receive at events </li><li>  Increase revenue from existing and newly created business flows </li><li>  Increase audience loyalty </li><li>  Enhance protection and security at the venue </li><li>  Achieve a high degree of transparency of financial transactions at the venue </li><li>  Value added for partner brands </li></ul><br>  The Allynis Smart Event Platform is a wearable technology based on NFC technology and a secure service platform that includes the following functions: <br><ul><li>  Identification, ticketing and access control </li><li>  Prepaid Payment Solutions </li><li>  Applications of transport operators </li><li>  Interfaces with social networks (contests, posts, etc.) </li><li>  Real-time data collection and analysis </li><li>  Mobile marketing </li></ul><br>  The solution is ideal for event organizers, stadium owners and their sponsors - it helps increase revenues per place (visitor) thanks to: <br><ul><li>  Extending the time of the visit; </li><li>  Accelerate the passage of control; </li><li>  Fast NFC payments (about 30% faster); </li><li>  Personalized loyalty programs; </li><li>  Improved understanding of client flow dynamics and visitor behavior patterns. </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXt6nmQHzkY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Long queues for drinks during public events and fears of cash dispensed in your pockets may now be in the past - the NFC bracelet will not only make stadium visits safer, but also save you time to enjoy your favorite team or performance of your favorite artist. <br><br>  Here on this site we have collected more information for you about Gemalto NFC solutions: <a href="http://communication.gemalto.com/gemalto-and-nfc">communication.gemalto.com/gemalto-and-nfc</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283480/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283480/</a></p>
