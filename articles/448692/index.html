We have prepared for you three useful features of Zimbra, which will certainly be useful to you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/524/a74/d9d/524a74d9dc834ae581c7893fc079c693.png" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Calendar card</b>

      One of the most important functions of the collaboration system is a synchronized diary, which allows managers to efficiently manage the time of their subordinates, set tasks, and set up meetings and conferences at a convenient time for all.  That is why quick access to the diary is one of those things that can significantly increase employee productivity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e4/zu/ww/e4zuwwzebs6nic25-8s0fssxwug.png"><br><br>  The ability to quickly see your schedule is available in Zimbra.  It is implemented as a built-in function ‚ÄúCalendar‚Äù - a small window with the days of the current month, which allows you to view your schedule for a particular day or add a new event to your diary directly from the main window of the Zimbra web client.  So, by clicking the left mouse button on the desired date in the calendar, you will immediately see your schedule for that day, and by clicking on it with the right mouse button, you can create a new meeting scheduled for that day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/f_/cz/zvf_cz9t3tzqjqcsvk0p1gunkyg.png"><br><br>  The ‚ÄúCalendar‚Äù display is enabled by default, however, if you wish, you can disable it in the ‚ÄúDiary‚Äù section of the Zimbra web client settings. <br><br>  <b>Forced spell checker</b> <br><br>  Business correspondence must be competent.  When communicating with people who do not see you, it is literate written speech that allows you to make a pleasant first impression.  In addition to typing errors, errors can creep into an e-mail when copying and pasting ready-made pieces of text that rarely get into when sending.  Zimbra can help you avoid errors in emails. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zb/op/qx/zbopqxo9jdsicsxsu1pxhflknqe.png"><br><br>  In the Zimbra web client settings, you can find a feature called ‚ÄúBe sure to check the spelling before sending a message‚Äù, which works exactly as you thought.  After clicking on the "Send" button, the web client checks the text of the letter for spelling and displays a warning about the errors found and offers to either ignore the errors or correct them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ma/64/wo/ma64wo4r_75mxz_fahu8ceu9gbc.png"><br><br>  As with any automatic spell checker, this feature does not guarantee 100% literacy in outgoing letters, but it can significantly reduce the number of typos and spelling errors in business correspondence, and therefore have a positive impact on the image of the enterprise as a whole. <br><br>  <b>Action flows</b> <br><br>  Practically in any enterprise there is a special mailbox for receiving letters with appeals, offers of cooperation, and so on.  The specifics of the operation of this mailbox implies that the filtering of incoming mail must either be minimal or be completely absent.  At the same time, someone should look through all received letters, and, punching through tons of spam, search for letters from living people.  And the more letters on such a box, the more precious working time the employee responsible for it spends on viewing such a box.  In addition, the cleaning of mailboxes from all sorts of mailings and spam can be claimed by ordinary workers.  Is it possible to somehow optimize this torturous process in Zimbra?  As it turned out, yes.  With this we can use the built-in function ‚ÄúWorkflow‚Äù, which filters mail on the client side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m7/4b/fm/m74bfmm0ospvdvxmt2-_bmjhw2u.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúWorkflow‚Äù allows you to create a separate folder in the user's mail, which will automatically get letters corresponding to the filters you set.  For example, the built-in functionality of the Zimbra web client allows you to automatically recognize and send marketing messages to the Workflow;  messages received through mailing lists;  messages where your address is not indicated in the To or Cc field;  as well as people who are not on your contact list.  Due to this, much less letters will be accumulated in the ‚ÄúInbox‚Äù folder, while letters that have accumulated in the ‚ÄúStream of Action‚Äù can be viewed without much fuss at the end of the working day and answered those that are businesslike. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0z/ht/yp/0zhtypfe71dyi5kyo9prj6m-abc.png"><br><br>  In addition to the four options listed, the ‚ÄúWorkflow‚Äù allows for more fine-tuning of the filtering of letters.  For example, you can create a separate folder for marketing letters, a separate folder for letters received from senders that are not in the contact list, and so on.  After applying the selected filters, the created folders will automatically be filled with letters, allowing you to receive only really important mail in the Inbox folder. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/448692/</a></p>
