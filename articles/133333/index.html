  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coraline. World is the opposite</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d81/680/0b0/d816800b0a50defb7039008d359f8485.jpg" alt="Coraline"><br>  Friends, with some frequency I share with you the masterpieces of modern animation.  Today I will tell you about the film, which will brighten up your Friday night and drip balm on aesthetic wounds.  "Coraline" for months lay on the nearest shelf, named: "It is necessary and urgent to watch."  I was afraid not to feel it to the end, not to enjoy every shot, to lose the mood. <br>  But the earth flew on the heavenly axis and I looked.  This is an instructive story of one family, the central character of which is Coraline.  The film is based on the story of Neil Gaiman (the dude, by the way, is extremely <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">versatile</a> ).  If we discard the plot, the picture and conventions, then the essence comes down to the phrase: "whatever your parents are, they are still your parents."  But we will not reject them (: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c4/b21/be4/4c4b21be431e8cfda4220bf062abec0d.jpg" alt="Coraline"></a> <br>  So in detail. <br>  The graphics of the film are very peculiar, you will not find such a one almost anywhere: neither in 3d-pixel movies, nor in puppet cartoons of the USSR.  Landscapes, interiors, heroes are unique and inimitable in their beauty.  This is a very justified step on the part of <a href="http://www.laika.com/">Laika</a> , and you will probably be very surprised to learn that in this film there is practically no 3D and computer animation.  He is a little more than a full puppet.  The creators in the amount of half a thousand people turned a huge job on modeling and animation.  And the result, admittedly, stunning - turned out to be a self-sufficient, very beautiful cartoon. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/003/00b/649/00300b6498983d028c17d096e215f116.jpg" alt="Coraline"></a> <br>  And, of course, we are talking not only about the graphic component, but also about the scenes, the director‚Äôs incredible fantasy, a kind of humor (Koralina‚Äôs boy‚Äôs friend is called Weyborne = WhyBorn) and each character‚Äôs personality.  In general, by the way, in some places the cartoon resembles my <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2596%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5,_%25D0%2596%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD-%25D0%259F%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">wife</a> 's <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2596%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5,_%25D0%2596%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD-%25D0%259F%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">dystopia</a> . <br>  As it happens in this scale of projects, music delivers.  The melody flows from beginning to end, almost without interruption - it is an organic thread of the story, it sets the mood of the stage and the audience. <br>  Needless to say, I highly recommend watching the movie in the original? <br>  It‚Äôs time to compile a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/3d_graphics/114021/">list of</a> <a href="http://eucariot.livejournal.com/51485.html">such</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/3d_graphics/92225/">spiritual</a> <a href="http://drugoe-kino.livejournal.com/2236721.html">films</a> ? <br>  By the way, Coraline has its own interactive website.  Alive, pleasant.  Not to say that stunning or unique, it is what it should be: <a href="http://coraline.com/">coraline.com</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc7/4cd/bff/bc74cdbffeff1ff3c9bac552ee7cb3b6.jpg" alt="Coraline"></a> <br>  Coraline is a scary movie.  Even I was a bit creepy.  But I do not think that it will alienate someone, rather, such a dose attracts and binds.  You can also note quite childish voices of heroes, both in the original voice acting and in translation.  They seem to be made more deliberately, but this move is not very clear to me. <br>  Coraline has a talking name - the type is not as it should.  She lives in a ‚Äúgray‚Äù world: an uncomfortable house, an unkempt yard, parents who are constantly busy and can neither find time for her nor buy her such coveted colored gloves.  She wants a fairy tale, wants change, and finds in her room the door to the world that will give her all this.  On the other side, mother, who prepares delicious cakes, gives presents, dad, who plays the piano and dedicates songs to it, a beautiful garden with flowers and fountains.  But there is one snag - instead of the eyes of all the buttons.  And in order for the girl to remain in this world, she must sew herself buttons on herself.  And in this world, all the neighbors turn into fantastically friendly and cheerful people. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b8/f38/deb/4b8f38deb7cb807dee6e5c707117e7b6.jpg" alt="Coraline"></a> <br>  But soon, this castle is crumbling, and Coraline learns scary things about her new parents and understands the value of her real, ‚Äúnot so attentive‚Äù father and mother.  On the one hand, this tale teaches you to love your parents (social advertising would be so unobtrusive), and on the other, each person will have a different meaning there.  I, for example, liked the idea that a girl bought all these gifts from a woman quite unlike her mother.  Again - a lesson. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jfxnifU0qWw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgTzMqxrZ1jTS7GSRDLdL4CZVInFg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  There is an opinion that the cartoon is terrible and children will not like it.
