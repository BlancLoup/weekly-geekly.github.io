They want to get the right answers immediately.  Is it possible for brands to take advantage of such moments?  The latest research from Google says that there is.  Mobile consumers are more likely to watch and share video advertisements, and at the same time, they feel more personally connected with the brand. </blockquote><br>  In the era of mobile advertising, consumers experience countless <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/blog/2015/06/micromoments/">micro-moments</a> throughout the day, while they go about their interests, solve problems, look for goods and make decisions.  These micro-moments are the new battleground for the hearts, minds and wallets of consumers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We see that more and more these moments occur while watching videos on mobile devices.  As for watching a digital video, even though the mobile device is small in itself, but a powerful screen here is of overwhelming importance.  In fact, 50% of the global Youtube audience is watching videos from mobile devices.  And, as we already reported in October, the Millennium generation is capable of concentrating attention twice as much while watching a video on a mobile device than when watching it on a TV.  For them, a mobile device is not a second or third screen.  For them, it is the first. <br><br>  A recent Google study with Ipsos MediaCT reveals how enthusiasm for mobile video can be translated into brands. <br><br>  The study examined the reaction of American consumers who watched videos on various devices and obtained amazing results.  It was found that the part of the audience that uses smartphones to watch video is much more willing to watch, share and feel a personal connection with video and brand advertising than the other part that watches video on desktops and TVs.

      Here are some insights from the study, regarding the perception of branded advertising and video content by smartphone users: <br><br>  <b>Smartphone users are more likely to browse and share brand advertising.</b> <br><br>  A Google study says that people who watch videos on their smartphones will see ads with a probability 1.4 times higher than those who watch videos on a desktop or TV.  And more smartphone users are more located not only for viewing ads, but also for its distribution.  Those who see ads and brand content on their smartphones will share this with a probability of 1.8 times more than those who view ads on the desktop.  Moreover, this incentive to share what we have seen also applies to offline media.  Smartphone users are 1.6 times more inclined to contact their peers and discuss with them watched video content than TV viewers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e1c/664/91b/e1c66491b9f871ebb22e82e0530017a4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Strengthen personal communication with consumers via mobile devices, but leave them a choice.</b> <br><br>  The study also found that, in addition to a greater inclination to view and distribute content and brand advertising, smartphone users are more prone to having a personal connection with the brand, the ads and videos of which they watch on their devices: 2 times compared with the TV audience and 1, 3 compared to desktop users.  At the level of intuition, when you think about the essence of watching videos on your smartphone, for you this is a more intimate and personal experience than watching videos on the desktop or TV.  Therefore, it seems natural that mobile video is the right place for brands to build personal connections with consumers. <br><br>  This suggests that brands should be more attentive to the personal experience that people get through their smartphones.  One way to show respect for mobile users is to give them the choice of advertising consumed.  In fact, more than a third of the users participating in the study confirmed that it is important for them to be able to skip the ads. <br><br>  Also, the choice is an advantage not only for mobile users;  but also for brands trying to establish contact with their consumers.  <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/case-studies/rosetta-stone-embraces-mobile-video.html">Rosetta Stone</a> , for example, conducted a TrueView advertising campaign to test various video sketches and see which ones are more captivating to the public.  Those versions that were preferred by a larger number of viewers were later posted on the Masthead multimedia banner on Youtube.  This two-way mobile approach allowed increasing the number of subscribers of their channel on Youtube by 51% and in addition to increasing the mobile traffic on the brand's website 10 times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9c8/235/76e/9c823576eec03a8aa22e691e4a2c7977.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Micro moments are those moments during which we reflexively stretch to the device in order to satisfy any need that has arisen.  Often this need is related to the product or service.  And mobile video plays an increasing role in meeting these needs.  More than 50% of the interrogated audience of video advertisements using smartphones said that watching the video helps them in making a purchase decision in stores or on the company's websites, they also noted Youtube as the number 1 place to look for information about a brand or product.  In fact, mobile phones may become new in-store consultants: in fact, one in three buyers prefers to use a smartphone to look for additional information than to contact an employee for help. <br><br>  Brands that win at such moments use video to determine user needs.  People who watch videos on smartphones tend to rate companies that offer video ads for their products and services 1.2 times higher than those who watch ads on the desktop.  Perhaps reviews or ‚Äúhow to make‚Äù videos are not as seductive as creative advertising, but they are necessary for any mobile marketing strategy.  They help consumers quickly assess the potential experience of owning a product. <br><br>  Just as with the introduction of the Internet before, mobile devices have a huge impact on consumer behavior.  Consumers are turning to their phones to get answers and, increasingly, to watch videos.  The good news is that brands have a place in this mobile world.  The audience of mobile video advertising in comparison with the audience of video advertising on desktops and televisions is more inclined to watch, share and feel a personal connection with advertising, moreover, it is looking for branded content that would help them in making a quick decision.  Brands will be able to win these micro moments when they meet the needs of consumers, showing respect for their need for relevance and freedom of choice. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291786/</a></p>
