  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hormone Therapy: Personal Impressions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am writing on really numerous requests. <br><br>  In the comments in one of the publications the topic ‚ÄúHRT‚Äù was raised.  I want to describe a little of my own and the experience of my friends who are on hormone therapy.  It so happened that I already live on hormones for two years.  As far as I know, this topic has not been raised on giktames yet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It should be noted that in our circles we distinguish between hormone replacement therapy - hormone replacement therapy from HRT (in principle, it can also be decoded from the English language only. Hormone replacement therapy).  The difference is understood as follows.  When HRT hormones are added to those already present in the body to obtain the desired dosage.  HRT is a complete replacement when the gland that is responsible for producing the desired hormone in the body or is missing for some reason (trauma, for example, or surgery) or is not active (incapacitated by drugs that a person has taken or is taking for other purposes).  Perhaps, this classification is not accurate, but it is also used by my friends by happiness HRT (or not as lucky as anyone), and by my endocrinologist. <br><br>  I'll start from the beginning.  Hormone therapy - it does not matter, additional or substitution - only the endocrinologist has the right to prescribe and only relying on the indications for therapy.  Neither on the advice of a trainer, nor even more so, you cannot take hormones yourself.  It is not worth it ... So.  The general procedure is as follows.  First, your doctor must determine that hormone therapy is indicated for you.  After that, the endocrinologist, based on the direction and analyzes, determines what dosages you will take and at what dosages.  In that order.

      And now about the pleasant.  Hormones seriously improve the quality of life.  I am almost 42 years old.  My hormones are now normal for 18-20 years.  After the start of taking hormones, the mood improved significantly, strength appeared.  In fact, I feel about the same as I felt when I was 20 years old.  That ‚Äúgood‚Äù obstinacy and purposefulness returned.  At the same time, life experience and caution inherent in my passport age have not gone away.  Increased hormone levels have a positive effect not only on the psychological component.  Physiologically, the body is also changing, and very much.  Some studies have shown a decrease in the likelihood of developing cardiovascular diseases.  Personally, my pressure began to normalize.  Perhaps reducing the likelihood of such unpleasant things like Alzheimer's disease. <br><br>  Oh not nice.  Hormones need to be taken every day.  Most often until the end of life.  I am not talking about those courses that bodybuilders drink.  I did not come across them and do not really imagine the mechanism of their action.  But something tells me that they do not change the quality of life.  They pump up muscles, yes, but they don‚Äôt have time to act on the psyche.  It takes a little longer than 4-6 weeks.  I have noticeable changes started somewhere in 2-3 months.  Well, I don‚Äôt understand the dosages called in the comments ... They called dosages up to 1 gram, I‚Äôm looking at my scheme: 7.5 grams of the drug, which is equivalent to only 4.5 milligrams of the hormone. <br><br>  In addition to hormones, one has to drink a sufficiently large amount of concomitant medications.  As a rule, these are complexes of vitamins and mineral substances.  Preparations for blood thinning, drugs for extinguishing the production of unwanted hormones.  Often, these drugs have not very good side effects, for example, one of the drugs that I take with hormones, flushes out calcium and activates the kidneys.  Therefore, we also had to optimize the diet a little, by introducing more foods with calcium into it to avoid osteoprosis. <br><br>  Before taking hormones, you need to stop drinking, smoking and reducing overweight, if you have it, of course, up to an indicator of BMI not higher than 27, preferably less than 25. This is due to some peculiarities of the behavior of hormones in the body.  So, nicotine, entering the blood, destroys hormones.  Both androgynous and estrogen.  It is believed that the effect of nicotine is terminated an hour after smoking a cigarette.  When hormones are produced by the glands of the body, it is not very scary.  But when you take hormones once a day ... you can not smoke. <br><br>  Dosages of hormonal drugs reduce the body's tolerance to alcohol.  This is confirmed by my experience and the experience of my friends on hormone therapy.  A bottle of beer, 50g of vodka is very intoxicating, almost immediately.  In addition, hormonal drugs are broken down by the liver, alcohol, too, so the hangover after such small doses unpleasantly surprises with its strength ... and the liver is pitiful. <br><br>  With fatty tissue is still more interesting.  It is able to absorb and accumulate drugs.  Accordingly, some part of the drug taken will not reach the destination.  But it's not so bad.  With the breakdown of adipose tissue drugs are returned to the blood.  It‚Äôs not too long to get an overdose, the thing is also not very pleasant. <br><br>  It should be remembered that a high concentration of hormones can increase the likelihood of hormone-dependent diseases, say, a high concentration of teotesterone increases the chances of getting prostate cancer.  Also with estrodiol can lead to a chance of developing breast cancer. <br><br>  In my opinion, the benefits of HRT outweigh the negatives.  But this is my sensible decision.  It is necessary to understand that hormones are not the elixir of immortality, they will not give extra years of life, but the quality of life will be much improved. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368635/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368635/</a></p>
