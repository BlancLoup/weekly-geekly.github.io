      During the work we made a clear conclusion that pictures and headlines can greatly affect the outcome of an advertising campaign. <br><br>  For simplicity, we created the ‚ÄúRules for good advertising‚Äù inside <a href="https://relap.io/">Relap.io</a> .  In the text we will examine 3 cases where we improved the results of the Republic of Kazakhstan according to the ‚Äúrules‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <b>This is a guide on how to:</b> </h2><br><ul><li>  increase the overall response from the advertising campaign, </li><li>  create images you want to click, </li><li>  write headlines for native advertising. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  <b>How to increase the response</b> </h2><br><br><h3>  <b>Help the user</b> </h3><br>  It doesn't matter what you sell - clothes, cars or covers for iPhone.  A person does not buy a product, he buys a solution or an emotion. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Speak human language</b> </h3><br>  People do not like obscure and obscure words, abbreviations and abbreviations.  Then we will tell you about the case where we got rid of all this.  Simplify the text and headline as much as marketing in the company allows. <br><br><br><br>  Imagine that your ad will appear in the news feed.  80% of users who are used to receive information from the tape, say that they are comfortable to advertise in the same format. <br><br><hr><br><br><h4>  <strong>Comment <a href="https://relap.io/%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Drelapblog%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dctr19raz">Relap.io</a></strong> </h4><br>  Other results of the research about what kind of advertising users like, accustomed to using the Internet since childhood, can be found in our material: <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://blog.relap.io/2016/03/03/millenial/">How a generation of 30 year olds is changing digital advertising</a> <br><br><hr><br><br></h4><h3>  <b>Find an emotionally engaging image.</b> </h3><br>  90% of readers first look at the picture, and then read the title.  Therefore, the task of the content manager is to find such images that not only duplicate the title, but also carry emotion.  It should be easy for the user to compare the hero image with himself (if there is a hero), or this is a picture you want to share or save yourself. <br><br>  We changed the image and title in the ad and increased the CTR 5 times.  This is an advertisement for a residential complex.  There was a CTR of 0.1%, became 0.5%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3cb/00b/dbc/3cb00bdbc36629db604d5827feca181a.jpg" alt="image01" width="1000" height="550"><br><br>  We showed customers their own new apartments, happy and happy.  And it worked.  All abbreviations have been removed from the headline.  They expressed "15 min." In the usual words - "close to the center."  "Benefit up to 3 million" is the price?  A discount?  Immediately not clear.  We remove. <br><br>  Another example is a clothing store: girls post such photos on Instagram and keep the bows they like.  This is a picture of them.  She worked.  There was a CTR of 0.18%, it became 1.8%. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f0d/ee1/6eb/f0dee16eb13f867d0191d2d23b139e83.jpg" alt="image00" width="1004" height="550"><br><br>  The title is not very changed in meaning.  We have generalized the names of brands, made the text easier visually and expressed the meaning in the usual sentence.  It turned out neatly and works 10 times better. <br><br><br><h2>  <b>What images to use?</b> </h2><br><br><h3>  <b>People are better than objects</b> </h3><br>  People trust people.  In 83% of advertising campaigns, the change of the image of objects in the photos of people gave a CTR increase of 2 times or more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f45/e63/bdf/f45e63bdfd22bd163eca322f1bdb5bde.jpg" alt="image04" width="1000" height="550"><br><br>  Grains of coffee do not cause emotions, and the girl who drinks this coffee with pleasure - yes. <br><br>  But remember the headlines, without a good text, even the most emotional pictures may not work.  20% of users accustomed to the tape <a href="https://blog.relap.io/2016/03/03/millenial/">read only the headlines</a> . <br><br><br><h3>  <b>On emotions and stock photos</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/56b/92a/4f8/56b92a4f8918b4b920c18e4cf98b830a.jpg" alt="image05" width="277" height="256"><br><br>  Every time you choose a photo from the stock, Harold suffers somewhere.  This is a fictional character with an unnatural smile.  The prototype of Harold served as a man who in all the photographs looked like an unhappy man who was made to smile. <br><br>  Choose pictures where people behave as in everyday life and are in a natural interior. <br><br>  Everything seems to be fine, but something is embarrassing - we have invented a verification method: if the characters look in the photo, like in the foreplay of a porn movie - scroll through this picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4a0/25c/9d6/4a025c9d6fb5c2fbc9f9549d48d42442.jpg" alt="image03" width="1000" height="650"><br><br><br><h3>  <b>This girl</b> </h3><br>  Probably everyone who searched for pictures for materials more than 2 times in their life are familiar with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/860/d6b/cdb/860d6bcdb84b2d9ff792a943c1341423.jpg" alt="Summer woman portrait. Asian girl smiling happy on beach vacation enjoying warm sunshine. Gorgeous mixed race Asian Chinese / Caucasian female model outside." width="914" height="373"><br><br>  This is the goddess stock photos!  She starred, probably, in all possible thematic photo shoots.  Her ageless face is found on banners all over the world.  She is very cute.  But please leave her alone. <br><br><br><h2>  <b>How to make a good headline?</b> </h2><br><br><h3>  <b>Write in sentences</b> </h3><br>  And not by transfers of goods and services. <br><br>  Speak human language.  Tell us how you can help the client and how his life will become easier and happier.  After all, this requires your product! <br><br>  Try to tell about your product or service by the method of <a href="https://blog.relap.io/2015/11/12/so_what/">"So what?"</a> .  It helps to make a text that will attract the reader from the list of features and benefits. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Speak as simple as possible</b> </h3><br>  Write simple sentences, use simple words.  In none of the examples given, we did not use special vocabulary or words, the meaning of which is difficult to explain. <br><br>  The implicated and verbal impulses make the speech heavier; such sentences are hard to read briefly.  If you can‚Äôt get rid of the dependent clause, use ‚Äúwhich‚Äù type unions. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Use lists</b> </h3><br>  <b>According to statistics from</b> <a href="https://relap.io/"><b>Relap.io,</b></a> <b>headers-lists collected 3 times more clicks than other headers.</b>  Users feel comfortable when information is systematized. <br><br><hr><br><br><h4>  <strong>Comment <a href="https://relap.io/%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Drelapblog%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dctr19raz">Relap.io</a></strong> </h4><br>  In detail about the benefits of lists, we wrote in the text <a href="https://blog.relap.io/2015/11/05/top10_why_top10_is_perfect/">"10 reasons why lists of 10 reasons are ideal for content marketing</a> . <a href="https://blog.relap.io/2015/11/05/top10_why_top10_is_perfect/">"</a> <br><br><hr><br><br>  We hope our experience will be useful to you. <br><br>  If you want to try <a href="https://relap.io/">Relap.io</a> advertising or learn more about us - email us at ads@relap.io <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299826/</a></p>
