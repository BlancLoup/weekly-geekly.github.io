  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to answer when asked at the interview question "not the topic"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sometimes personnel officers may ask questions at the interview that are completely unrelated to the topic of the interview.  Naturally, this makes sense and specific goals.  And to answer such questions correctly is no less important than the question about work experience and the amount of the desired salary.  Abstract questions at the interview can be divided into 4 types: <br>  evaluating the general outlook of the applicant, the ability to speak on common topics (which is especially important for people of communicative professions).  You may be interested in your ideas about happiness or be asked to speculate about the role of "the phenomenon of cosmopolitanism within the framework of the general global trend towards globalization."  With the help of such questions, it is quite easy to assess the degree of ‚Äúinclusion‚Äù of a candidate in a dialogue, the role he plays in communication (leader, slave), the ability to listen and, of course, general erudition. <br><br>  "Near professional".  These questions include: ‚ÄúWhat periodicals do you read?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow do you imagine your ideal friend?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat would you like to do in your professional activities to your wife, friend, father?‚Äù, Etc.  Answers will prompt the employer (recruiter), what is the ‚Äútrue‚Äù attitude to the profession of the applicant, the degree of his involvement in the overall working context.  If the CFO regularly reviews Finance magazine or subscribes to the RBC website mailing list, you can say with great certainty that we have a financier with a good professional ‚Äúlining‚Äù, most likely, this is not just a performer, but an enterprising person and in the context of the situation . <br><br>  personality-oriented.  These questions from the series: "Your main family tradition?", "What are your preferences when choosing a place for dinner?".  Evaluation of the answers will allow to draw conclusions about the personal characteristics of the applicant (tendency to loneliness, aggressiveness, features of communication, including among colleagues, etc.).

      assessment of claims.  These questions are aimed at the vision of the professional future of the candidate, including in the company-employer.  For example: ‚Äúhow do you see yourself in 10 years?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs your biggest career goal?‚Äù.  According to the answers of the applicant, one can judge the level of professional self-esteem of a person, his aspirations and ambitions.  For example, the sales manager claims that after 1 year, and no later, he sees himself as the head of the sales department.  And the management of the employing company is not interested in senior staff at the moment, so this answer will not play into the hands of the candidate.  Although it may be the opposite. <br><br>  How to answer them? <br><br>  * It is necessary to answer as honestly as possible, not trying to look as good as possible, sacrificing your own principles and beliefs. <br><br>  * It would be nice to thoroughly examine the vacancy and, if possible, the company, before the interview, prepare for answers to all sorts of questions.  During the meeting, you should carefully listen to the interlocutor in order to correct your answers in time, because, for example, the lack of plans in the company for the introduction of a leadership position may go against your guidelines. <br><br>  * Be active!  Ask questions yourself, communicate with the interlocutor (resort to detailed answers, emotionally supported) - do not force to simulate the situation of the interrogation.  Remember: the choice is made not only by the manager, but also by you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152/</a></p>
