      Working alone can easily lead to a feeling of isolation.  And it can seriously affect performance and personal health. <br>  Join the community of entrepreneurs like you.  At least virtually, in social networks. <br><br>  <b>2. Appreciate your time</b> <br><br>  I am always for help, but if you understand that your resources are already just being used, start providing advice on a fee basis. <br>  In an ideal world, of course, you would always have time to do all your work and help friends and needy people, but the reality is that you need to constantly prioritize and take care of your business first and foremost. <br><br>  <b>3. Watch your health</b> <br><br>  There are many studies that show the correlation between good health and performance.  People who devote time to exercise, meditation, and proper nutrition are more motivated and work better than those who do not. <br><br>  <b>4. Delegate tasks</b> <br><br>  Repeat after me: ‚ÄúI should not do everything myself.‚Äù Repeat after me: ‚ÄúI should not do everything myself.‚Äù Delegate all tasks that do not require your personal knowledge and skills. <br>  This was the most difficult thing when I started my business, however, you can also learn how to delegate effectively. <br><br>  <b>5. Do not forget about social networks.</b> <br><br>  Having a strong Internet presence is one of the best ways to build your reputation and attract potential customers to your business.  Set aside a certain amount of time each day, even 20 minutes, to promote you and your online business. <br>  Write useful notes and share them with your friends on social networks, optimize your website and content to attract more search engine traffic, take the time to monitor, find out how people speak about your company via the Internet. <br><br>  <b>6. Invest in the best specialists.</b> <br><br>  Do not be tempted to hire employees or freelancers just because they are cheap.  For optimal long-term results, I recommend hiring the best specialists that you can afford. <br>  Choose professionals with a proven reputation, sociable and pleasant to you on a personal level.  Keep in mind that skills can be learned, while a person‚Äôs character cannot be changed. <br><br>  <b>7. Do not work with problem clients.</b> <br><br>  Not all money is good money.  Do not waste your precious time and resources on working with difficult customers. <br>  When considering the issue of working with new customers, look at the big picture.  Of course, a client who is willing to pay big money for services is good news, but if it threatens to turn into high operating costs, this contract may not be so profitable. <br>  Remind yourself that screening out problem customers will set you free to focus on other customers ‚Äî those who actually respect you and your time. <br><br>  <b>8. Set aside time for personal growth and learning.</b> <br><br>  Continuous learning is the minimum requirement for success in any field. <br>  Attend conferences and seminars that are useful for you and your business, read books and industry publications, and regularly visit thematic blogs. <br><br>  <b>9. Remember that it really matters.</b> <br><br>  It is very easy to get bogged down in business life: work for hours on end, sort things out on your own.  But, if you start feeling depressed, offended, tired, take a moment to think about what is really important in life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299888/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299888/</a></p>
