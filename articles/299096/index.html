    <blockquote>  This statistic is particularly interesting because the 4th quarter is the busiest time for online trading.  Holidays and pre-holiday shopping. </blockquote><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What happened to the open rate:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/53a/a17/4b5/53aa174b59f163023d24d256aaf22b6e.png" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  Judging by the numbers, the only campaigns that showed an increase in discoveries are Welcome letters and Resuscitation. </blockquote><br><br><br>  Most likely, the reason for such a drop in the percentage of discoveries in overcrowding customer mailboxes.  During the holiday period, only lazy did not send a letter to its customers. <br><br>  Oversupply had a bad effect on performance. <br><br>  The growth of the discoveries of resuscitation letters is due to the fact that they contain the most personalized content for customers and are based on the history of their purchases and interests. <br><br>  Welcome letters showed an unprecedented increase in this period due to the fact that many customers registered on the sites of new stores in search of the right gift, subscribed to the list.  Accordingly, eagerly opened the welcome letters. <br><br>  <b>Analyze Click Rate:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/807/c9d/b36/807c9db3649c1063d2edcc58f35a21cd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The situation with clicks is directly opposite.  All campaigns have increased the percentage of clicks, except for the abandoned basket, resuscitation and letters after purchase. <br><br><blockquote>  It's no secret that Email marketing is the ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù of digital marketing, so it‚Äôs logical that the number of referrals from a letter grows during the peak period of trading. </blockquote><br><br><br>  Resuscitation letters showed no increase in clicks, because their main goal is to return inactive customers, and in the pre-holiday period, customers are more likely to click on the offer of ‚Äúcrazy discount‚Äù or ‚Äúsuper profitable promotion.‚Äù <br><br>  The drop in the percentage of clicks of letters after purchase is most likely due to the fact that these letters include not only ‚Äúletters to increase customer loyalty,‚Äù but also standard mailing with an offer of additional goods after 30, 60, etc.  days after purchase. <br><br>  As for the abandoned basket, the fall was predictable.  During the pre-holiday bustle and increased traffic on the websites of online stores, customers often add products to the cart without planning to buy anything. <br><br>  Accordingly, they do not react in any way to the received reminder about the unfinished purchase. <br><br>  <b>Average profit on 1 sent letter:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7ff/5f2/cc7/7ff5f2cc7ff72fb6a2433b4910287a1a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Average bill:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/084/9ac/411/0849ac411ee6607d9922485cfd53c5d6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, the situation in the 4th quarter turned out to be very ambiguous and defies any logic. <br><br>  Email campaigns that showed an increase in open-rate, lost clicks, those who have increased profits / 1 letter, have lost in the amount of the average check. <br><br>  Light on this situation can shed statistics, published by RJ Metrics.  She, at a minimum, proves how important and responsible the 4th quarter of each year is for online trading: <br><br><ul><li>  Shops attract 20-59% more customers during the holidays.  With this, this figure may be more for stores that are sensitive to seasonality. </li><li>  39% of customers who make purchases in the pre-holiday season, buy again in the same store in the same period. </li><li>  24% of its annual turnover, seasonal festive goods stores receive through sales in the 4th quarter. </li></ul><br><br><br>  <i>And how was your ‚Äúpre-holiday‚Äù period?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299096/</a></p>
