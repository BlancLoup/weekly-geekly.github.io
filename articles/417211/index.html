Why not?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9x/q1/3j/9xq13jdrh0jpclfvfsqlmk_gxvs.png"><br><br>  Earlier, I already wrote how I <a href="https://habr.com/post/394435/">did an "electric" constructor</a> from ... cardboard.  Alas, the project still remains at the prototype stage, not developing into an industrial ‚Äúphysical‚Äù look and is waiting for its time (and investor). <br><br>  But I decided to go further - once we started making cardboard, we‚Äôll bring the situation to its logical conclusion - we‚Äôll make a completely cardboard board game, but with an electrical setting and a learning effect.  There were a lot of options - starting from a simple ‚Äúwalker‚Äù and ending with amitress from a <s>zombie</s> with electron movement and vicious short circuits and swollen capacitors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As a result, I decided to dwell on a logical abstract, since the schematics of electrical circuits are very suitable for it.  Said and done - as a result of the first iteration, the game "Chain" was born.

Who lit one or both light bulbs - he won.  Of the components on the field, you could lay out a resistor, an LED (which burned out without a resistor) and a diode that worked ... like a diode.  That is, allowed to "cut off" the chain opponent. <br><br>  During the following years, the game began to transform and change.  At first it was decided to transfer it into space and, instead of light bulbs, supply power to the engines of the spacecraft.  After that, it was decided to light the bulbs not strictly on top of the field, but laying them on any place of the playing field.  As a result, the ‚Äúrepair‚Äù option of the robot scheme was selected, when players are offered a pre-prepared playing field with light bulbs, LEDs and power buses located on the sides and bottom, and he needs (also in the fight with rivals) to increase his level of electrics and ‚Äúrepair‚Äù the greatest number items. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ri/ge/_8/rige_8m2tnnkaqmqx9nph0iyh9u.png" width="600"><br><br>  Now it was possible to create not one continuous, but different electrical circuits (and constantly checking them for operability and short circuit), which made the players choose different tactics and think over the strategy of placing elements.  And the number of players increased to three (and in theory to four). <br><br>  And if you can add items, why not remove them?  Soldering irons were introduced into the game and now you can drop the interfering element and replace it with a new one (if you have time).  Also, switches have been added to the game that can be ‚Äúclosed‚Äù to the positive or negative bus. <br><br>  And so that the player‚Äôs life was even more difficult, transistors (in key mode) and photodiodes were introduced into the game, as well as a reserve for new elements.  Plus added points, the achievement of a certain level of which gives the player the title of "Grief-electrician" "Chief electrician". <br><br>  The game began to get a finished look (at the same time changed its name to ‚ÄúDo not short circuit!‚Äù) - there is a logical component, there is a need to at least learn the basic principles of building an electrical circuit and its components, interest for children and adults too (judging by the tests).  In this form, the game has lived and been tested for the last six months and is now beginning to ‚Äúovergrow with meat‚Äù - that is, to get a colorful decoration. <br><br>  For some time I ‚Äútossed about‚Äù in order to leave the game ‚Äúas it is‚Äù in the form of black and white schemes and make it beautiful.  The scales leaned toward beauty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qf/bz/sg/qfbzsg43wvwdfjspikuprmsf0bs.png"><br><br>  Someone may say that the electric ‚ÄúCarcassonne‚Äù has turned out, and will be partially right (tiles, the mechanism for building continuous ‚Äúroads‚Äù with setting glow tokens), but in fact the game turned out to be not original (with the current number of games being released it‚Äôs hard to come up with a new mechanic) but definitely unusual (especially for the Russian market of educational games). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417211/">https://habr.com/ru/post/417211/</a></p>
