      It is planned to track suppliers of such services by checking payments to foreign contractors: <br><blockquote>  An official of the tax authority has the right to demand documents (information) regarding the operations of a foreign organization - taxpayer (tax agent) specified in paragraph 3 of Article 174.2 of this Code from the organization of the national payment card system, money transfer operators, electronic money operators, bank payment operators. agents (subagents), payment system operators, payment infrastructure service operators, operational centers, payment clearing centers, central payment  s clearing counterparties, settlement centers and service providers. </blockquote><br><br>  Then they will be forced to obtain an electronic signature and make reports through it and pay in the taxpayer's personal account. <br><blockquote>  A foreign organization - a taxpayer (tax agent) specified in paragraph 3 of Article 174.2 of this Code is required to submit to the tax authority a value-added tax return, other documents (information) through the taxpayer's personal account. </blockquote><br><br>  Sanctions for refusing to register and pay, oddly enough, do not mean blocking, but most likely it will be finalized for the second reading.  In the meantime, they want to wring out the property by police officers: <br><blockquote>  Removal from accounting of a foreign organization - taxpayer (tax agent) specified in paragraph 3 of article 174.2 of this Code on the grounds provided for by this paragraph is carried out after the end of measures to collect tax amounts, penalties, fines provided for in Articles 46, 47 of this Code ‚Äù </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/355926/">https://habr.com/ru/post/355926/</a></p>
