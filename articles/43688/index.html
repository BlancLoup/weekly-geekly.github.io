And that will be said. <br><br>  Having worked for 3 months, we found out what works and what does not work in coworking.  The experience is subjective, personal, but still.  Now, after another 3 months, the assumptions have been confirmed, so you can take them as a basis and take the next step: try to describe what this coworking is all the same.

      In the Russian mentality and, importantly, the global crisis. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Anyone who understands the economy, both global and Russian, understands that economic games are conducted on several levels.  In Russia, as usual, these levels are considered: official power, the highest entrepreneurial clique, power structures that are more or less separate from them, blue collars and the rest of the people themselves - pensioners, children, poorly educated citizens.  This separation has been going on since the 90s: after the structural collapse of the domestic economy, ‚Äúgrabbers‚Äù appeared, outgrowing oligarchs today, then, reinforced by the crisis of the 98th, the ‚Äúsiloviks‚Äù separated from the direct subordination of the official power, getting on their feet, getting almost destroyed during the war years, the class of "trudge-engineers," and the generation of the '40s, living out their years, drank a lot of grief over all this time. <br><br>  Feel that we have missed, no? <br><br>  There is a strong social stratum in Russia that is growing stronger, but not yet fully operational.  It is of little benefit to the authorities, since it is sufficiently educated and potentially economically dangerous.  It is not at all profitable for the oligarchic class, since it changes the market ‚Äúfor themselves‚Äù.  I'm talking about "merchants" - small and medium businesses. <br><br>  Since young enterprises do not yet have the necessary connections to solve issues ‚Äúout of friendship‚Äù, and do not have enough money to push through ‚Äúthe masses‚Äù - they unite.  Separately nothing, together they are a great power.  Gradually, building up collective power, small business creates its own, independent markets, loops over itself - and this is beneficial for people ‚Äúin general‚Äù, since the basis of cooperation is not the principle of strength and not ‚Äúdivide and conquer‚Äù, but normal competition provided by the price balance / quality. <br><br>  Well, ideally. <br><br>  So, co-working is a transitional organizing stage, at the entrance of which there is a certain mass of educated and freedom-loving people (I would like to consider also farsighted), and at the exit - organized structures for the production of goods and services.  That is his mission, mission, if you will: providing an environment for growth.  The benefits are the same: growing companies do not budge into outer space, but become part of a network, part of a ‚Äúguild‚Äù.  And the network, growing, forms a "third force", economically independent and therefore poorly controlled. <br><br>  Like Branson's ‚ÄúVirgin‚Äù: a multitude of companies with a single world view and under a single brand, independent of anyone whom they don‚Äôt want to depend on. <br><br>  Of course, so far all this is nothing more than reflections.  I am not ready to subscribe to every word, stating that the market works that way;  works for us, and then we need to check.  And besides, I have absolutely no idea what models St. Petersburg ‚ÄúNew Level‚Äù, Moscow ‚ÄúKo-Pay‚Äù and many others are created about, which I have not heard about, but surely they are growing successfully. <br><br>  The guys may have a completely different opinion.  And this is good. <br><br>  Well, we work on.  If interested - there is a place :) Come. <br><br>  Sincerely, Alexey Glazkov. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43688/</a></p>
