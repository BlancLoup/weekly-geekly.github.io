Livestreet"></div><br><br>  As many have already guessed from the title, it will be about the <b><a href="http://livestreet.ru/">LiveStreet</a></b> engine, or rather, about the basic Synio template, which is included in the CMS assembly, and the author of which I was lucky to become. <br><br>  Today I would like to tell you about the process of its creation and about what we managed to realize. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote><h4>  <b>What is good design?</b> </h4>

      As a digression, I want to say that, in my opinion, design is first of all functionality and attention to detail.  Not the ability to choose a combination of colors and even not the ability to make beautiful graphics, namely, convenience and love for trifles are, I think, the main components in the formula of any successful design. </blockquote><br><br><hr><br><br><h4>  <b>Task</b> </h4><br>  Any project, in my opinion, should start with the formation of the project objectives. <br><br>  And in this case, the solution of the problem should be a template that is suitable for different projects by subject, with a simple but functional interface and a simple color scheme that could be safely changed in the future. <br><br><hr><br><br><h4>  <b>Analysis</b> </h4><br>  Once the task is clear, you should study the market.  In simple terms, understand user needs and analyze existing projects in this environment. <br><br>  Of course, if you go back to the history of creating LiveStreet CMS, then the first person you should pay attention to was Habrahabr, because it was the Habr functional that was at the bottom of this engine. <br>  But for three and a half years ( <i>and by that time it was exactly that time that turned to Livestritu</i> ), the differences in functionality were already significant. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/45f/3a8/dd4/45f3a8dd4a0f7cbd8b36814a69096793.png" alt="Find the chips"></div><br><br>  In addition to Habr, there were other blog-social and news sites, the experience of which I began to explore. <br>  For example, ‚Äú <b><a href="http://lookat.me/">Look At Me</a></b> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://afisha.ru/"><b>Poster</b></a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://dou.ua/"><b>DOU</b></a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://livejournal.com/"><b>LJ</b></a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://ridus.ru/"><b>Reedus</b></a> ‚Äù and others (about 15 in total).  I took a piece of paper and looked for the most successful solutions in functionality. <br><br><hr><br><br><h4>  <b>Teamwork</b> </h4><br>  Of course, when creating a design, constant consultations are required with those who know the functionality from the ‚Äúinside‚Äù - with the system developers. <br><br>  A curious fact is that due to the geographical location, I am with the LiveStreet CMS development team in different countries and time zones, and we have never met in person, although we have known each other for several years. <br><br>  Therefore, for remote communication, we used three main tools: <b>GMail</b> (and <b>GTalk</b> in particular) - for brief discussions, <a href="http://worksection.com/21/"><b>Worksection</b></a> - it <a href="http://worksection.com/21/"><b>did the</b></a> main work, discussion of tasks and intermediate results, and of course <b>Skype</b> - for long debates and ‚Äúofftopic‚Äù topics <i>( where do without them)</i> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0b2/cfa/c60/0b2cfac60da493e07ab1fc6bd0db7577.png" alt="GMail Worksection Skype"></div><br><br><h5>  pros </h5><br>  The main advantage of remote work is the ability to work in your own schedule of the day - for example, I often sit at night if the work is interesting.  In addition, you can significantly save time without going to the office <i>(for large cities it is from forty minutes to two hours daily)</i> . <br><br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br>  The disadvantage of this method of work is a longer stretch of time than, as it seems to me now, it could be if we were sitting in the same office and ‚Äúkicking‚Äù each other with enviable regularity.  But despite this, we have achieved the desired results. <br><br><hr><br><br><h4>  <b>New in the design of the base template</b> </h4><br>  Turning to design, I remind you that, as I wrote earlier, the functionality should have become the cornerstone of the new design.  And I tried to introduce the experience of other projects and supplement it with my own ideas. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/90f/750/b04/90f750b043525655aaf3d7854a00de9b.png" alt="Synio"></div><br><br>  <b>A. Visual block</b> <br>  The new version has a graphic block with the image of the possibilities that appear to the user after clicking the "Create" button. <br><br>  At the same time, you can switch between creating a blog or a topic and in the next step, directly in the creation form. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4cd/9d6/1da/4cd9d61da2d93a786e5fe86d3bd48c09.png" alt="Synio. Livestreet"></div><br><br>  <b>B. Number of voters for the topic</b> <br>  It was decided to make statistics on the number of voters and abstentions in a separate pop-up block, which appears after hovering over the voting element. <br><br>  <b>C. Navigation unit</b> <br>  A quick navigation block has been added that allows you to switch from one topic header to another.  Also on it there is a neat button "Top". <br><br>  <b>D. Selection of "topikstarter"</b> <br>  In the comments, the author's nickname is underlined to make it easier to distinguish it from other participants in the conversation. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ad/313/3a5/4ad3133a5f7dd0fc4737300d6cd07345.png" alt="Synio. Livestreet"></div><br><br>  <b>E. Convenient search and sort users</b> <br>  In the " <a href="http://livestreet.ru/people/">People</a> " section, you can quickly search by username.  As well as sorting alphabetically, strength and rating.  As well as the ability to display users who are currently on the site. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/995/4d6/9ce/9954d69ce424dec0ffd4d25d30c59719.png" alt="Synio. Livestreet"></div><br><br>  <b>F. Text of the comment live</b> <br>  Live added the ability to quickly view the text of the comment in the pop-up block.  And now there was no need to go to the topic to find out whether you are interested in it or not. <br><br>  <b>G. Quick search by tags</b> <br>  The block with tags was supplemented with the ability to switch between common and own tags.  And also there appeared a search with tips. <br><br>  <b>H. Ability to quickly join a blog with one click</b> <br>  In front of each blog name in the <a href="http://livestreet.ru/blogs/">same section</a> appeared buttons "Read", by clicking on which the user becomes a blog reader. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7df/a0e/872/7dfa0e87272f44b001d3d9a0f98e7bc0.png" alt="Synio Add Picture"></div><br><br>  <b>I. Photo upload</b> <br><br>  Separate attention deserves loading photos.  In one compact unit, the ability to upload a photo to a topic from a computer or from the Internet is realized, or simply to place it by indicating a direct link. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b02/c94/8d7/b02c948d79298b691be8cabc1990569a.png" alt="Synio"></div><br><br>  <b>J. Different avatars</b> <br>  The undoubted "beauties" that we wanted to realize are distinguished avatars for the beautiful and strong sexes.  Now, if the user has not uploaded his photo, but indicated the gender, it will be possible to distinguish him by gender and in the photo. <br><br><hr><br><br><h4>  <b>Summarizing</b> </h4><br>  In total, <b>more than 35 screens</b> and about <b>50 various icons and pictograms have been</b> <b>drawn</b> for the project. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fc4/238/754/fc423875427afc16c80a0da243112ac7.png" alt="Synio. Icons"></div><br><br>  <b>The main stage of work on the design lasted two and a half months</b> , but even now there is a need for drawing to implement new ideas and additional functionality. <br><br>  In general, working on this project, in the same team with such talented people as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ort/" class="user_link">ort</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/deniart/" class="user_link">deniart</a> , turned out to be an exciting and enjoyable experience. <br><br><h4>  <b>PS</b> </h4><br>  For those who have not yet seen how the new design looks in life - <b><a href="http://livestreet.ru/">this link is</a></b> for you. <br>  If someone has questions about the design of templates on LiveStreet - ask, I will try to answer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148374/</a></p>
