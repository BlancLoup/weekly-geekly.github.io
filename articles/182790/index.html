  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How in Ukraine to accept payments on PayPal in general (and when selling on eBay in particular)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Foreword </h4><br>  I see no reason to describe the conditions that prompted me to search for opportunities to receive funds for PayPal from other PayPal accounts.  Instead, almost immediately go to the essence of the opportunity found.  Almost - because I would like to declare in advance that the opportunity was found through theoretical speculations and has not been translated into reality.  I am a God-fearing and law-abiding citizen, because I hate to have a full PayPal account (and sell on eBay using the default payment method, which buyers are not afraid of) if you have to provide false data with near-zero probability of detecting fraud.  Generally, <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  The essence of the opportunity found </h4><br>  In order to create an account in Polish PayPal, since on the one hand Poland uses the full-fledged functionality of PayPal, and on the other hand, a card of the Ukrainian bank can be tied to such an account. <br><br>  <i>Creating a Polish PayPal account</i> <br>  You need to go to <a href="http://paypal.pl/">paypal.pl</a> , click on the "Za≈Ç√≥≈º konto" button ("create an account"), on the next page choose Poland as your region and English as your language and click "Get Started" under the inscription "PayPal for you".  On the new page, all personal information, except for the address, is better to indicate truthfully.  A non-Polish phone number will not be a stumbling block, but PayPal will be able to contact you if needed.  The name with the same name should theoretically coincide with those on the bank card, but in fact in most cases the payments will pass and if they are completely different.  However, be careful, you will not be able to significantly change the name after registration, and you may need to confirm it with documents (see details in the ‚ÄúRaise limits‚Äù section).  The address must be Polish.  This can be any Polish address, but to make it more convenient, I would recommend the address of a random object in the city with a name reminiscent of Ukrainian, or just let its format resemble the address that you can confirm with any documents (details in the ‚ÄúRaise Limits‚Äù section). ).

      <i>Bank card binding</i> <br>  In order to verify your new account, as well as to cover the shortage of funds in your PayPal account when making purchases, you need to link your real card to it.  The procedure is performed absolutely ordinary.  Cards of banks operating on the territory of Ukraine will be suitable, with a high probability, any of them.  We can say for sure that the cards of the banks Erste (recently - Fido) and Alfa-Bank are suitable.  As already mentioned, the discrepancy between the first name and the last name, and the more so the addresses specified during the registration of the account, will not interfere with the success of transactions.  The 16-digit card number, its expiry date and CVV code will be enough so that you can pay with PayPal with money from your card, which means it can be verified, since the procedure is based on withdrawing a small amount of cents from your card and then returning it. <br><br>  <i>Annual limit on incoming funds</i> <br>  By opening and verifying a new account, PayPal sets an annual limit on receiving funds in PLN 9,600, which is approximately equal to $ 2,900.  Receiving funds here means only transferring money from other PayPal accounts to yours;  If the money gets into the account from your card (for example, when you buy with payment through PayPal and the lack of funds on it), this amount will not bring you closer to reaching the mentioned limit.  If the opportunity to receive $ 2,900 a year is enough for you, you can skip the next paragraph.  Remember, however, that if it still happens to exceed it, the account will be immediately and without warning limited until you raise the limit.  He will be able to accept payments, but not send them.  If this has already happened, (or if not already, but you have a little limit), the next paragraph about it. <br><br>  <i>Raising the limit (optional)</i> <br>  The function is as follows: My Account -&gt; Overview -&gt; View Limits -&gt; Lift Limits. <br>  PayPal itself describes the procedure simply - Identify yourself.  However, in reality, the question is in identifying not only the individual, but also the address, in which lies the greatest difficulty.  To confirm your identity, we simply take a passport (or national support there surprisingly reads the Cyrillic alphabet) and attach a scan / photo.  Citizenship of Ukraine (or another country) is not yet a reason to be a non-resident of Poland.  To confirm the address, PayPal gives us several options to choose from: receipts from utility bills, replenishment of an account of mobile operators, driver‚Äôs licenses, an extract from the bank on the account or card.  Prerequisites are the presence of your name on the document (must coincide with the one specified during registration) and your address (must be the same as specified during registration), as well as less than a year old document.  I know for sure that an attempt to send a screenshot of payment through the same PayPal as an address confirmation, where there is a name and the notorious Polish address of the account is indicated in the Shipping Address column, will not succeed.  Therefore, the best option I considered a bank statement - a solid document, confirmed by the seal and signature of the bank representative.  When you request a statement in your branch of the bank, you need to say that the address is printed.  The bank address is accepted on faith and without any evidence (however, the country must coincide with the country in whose territory the bank branch is located, since non-residents have special rules of service and it is better not to touch the 12-meter stick).  This, in turn, provides a convenient opportunity to indicate that you have moved to a new address before requesting an extract from a bank branch: say, Lublin, Sventok≈°kizka street, 42, index 04135. Now, if you are lucky, and in the line with the address the statement does not indicate the country (most banks do not print it, as they consider the client to be the default resident), you are the holder of the document confirming your Polish address ul.  Swietokrzyska 42, 04-135 Lublin, which PayPal will believe.  If it wasn't lucky - even I, having never worked with Photoshop before, could (or rather, could) change the word ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù to ‚ÄúPolscha‚Äù.  True, in order for not a single word to be highlighted, it would be necessary to change all the words in the address bar, but it does not require skills and should not take much time.  An example would be this statement, which I would have made, if I wished to engage in fraud: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9b/98d/bf5/a9b98dbf548089fa36e6ca8381310d40.jpg"><br>  You can attach a newly created document in the place proposed by PayPal and submit an application.  The result will be successful, and the limit - removed. <br><br><h4>  Open horizons </h4><br>  It is obvious that now it will be possible to transfer money from other PayPal accounts to your account (including accepting payment for items sold on eBay) and, of course, pay for purchases with funds from a linked card.  What it is worth to dwell upon is the possibility of using PayPal funds for their intended purpose - as payment for purchases.  The fact is that you will still not be able to withdraw them without significant commissions from the system, which means that the disposal of money with the highest efficiency - the purchase. <br>  1. You can buy goods with physical delivery directly to your real address for this money only on eBay.  The address you specified in your eBay account will be higher priority than the address associated with PayPal, so sellers will send you where to write in your buyer profile on eBay. <br>  2. Outside of eBay, you can still buy products that require physical delivery, but you have to use Mail Forwarding to do this.  This does not at all obligate your long-suffering Polish address to be a warehouse address.  The fact is that when buying outside of eBay and calculating via PayPal, the latter allows delivery not to the address from your account, provided that it is located in Europe (is it worth saying that Ukraine contextually is not Europe), namely - in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãfull functioning PayPal .  In practice, this means that you can choose a Mail Forwarding warehouse in the UK, Germany or another EU country and make a purchase in the online store with payment through PayPal and delivery to the specified warehouse, where the item will be sent to the real address in the CIS. <br>  3. And finally, the category of goods that does not require physical delivery, say, digital copies of software or donations to Wikipedia.  There is no reason for such problems when calculating the funds on your PayPal, it will never rest. <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  The method described above may be suitable for owners of not only Ukrainian bank cards, but also cards of banks operating in other CIS countries, but I did not have the opportunity to empirically test this.  I would be grateful for such statistics, the post will be updated when it appears. <br>  Once again, I would like to remind you that, because of its dubious legitimacy, the method described above has never been tested in practice, but the author of the post is more than confident in the accuracy of the conclusions of his analysis of the PayPal service and other organizations mentioned. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182790/</a></p>
