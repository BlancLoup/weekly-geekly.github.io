  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ministry of Communications wants to ban phones without GLONASS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the Ministry of Communications presented a <a href="http://news.rambler.ru/22052344/">bill</a> according to which only mobile phones with support for the GLONASS navigation system can be used in Russia.  Although it is not clear how this will be controlled, most likely, it is a question of a ban on importation and sale.  Such a decision was made with the purpose, I quote <blockquote>  In order to ensure the stability of the functioning of the single telecommunication network of the Russian Federation in various conditions. </blockquote>  Requirements (if this law is adopted) will apply to both manufacturers and sellers.  Monitoring the execution of the law will be entrusted to Roskomnadzor. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  How did this come to? </h5><br>  Personally, this news is not very surprising (and not only because it is another project of the State Duma), not so long ago there was another similar initiative, the essence of which was to switch public transport to the use of the same system <blockquote>  "Until the end of the year, almost all of Moscow will be covered by this service", - </blockquote>  The head of Navigation and Information Systems OJSC (NIS GLONASS) Alexander Gurko said.  About 2 billion rubles will be allocated for this project from the state budget, while around 6 thousand vehicles will be equipped, which, if you count, comes out approximately 333,333 rubles each, for one transport (the expensive navigators have now gone). <br><br><h5>  Is the game worth the candle? </h5><br>  The need for its own geo-positioning system is a controversial issue.  On the one hand, at key sites and industries, such as the military-industrial industry, this is necessary, because in the event of a ‚Äúconflict of interests‚Äù our devices installed on airplanes, tanks and other equipment can simply be disconnected from satellites.  But on the other hand, there is sound rationalism, if it has washed away on military equipment, then how sideways is mobile phones?  Immediately there are 2 main questions: <br><br><ul><li>  How will these ‚Äúinnovations‚Äù appear on the price? </li><li>  Is GLONASS better than GPS? </li></ul><br><h6>  Issue price </h6><br>  The developers of the phones are following the trends, and therefore, starting from such models as Iphone 4s, Sony Ericsson Xperia ray and others, there is support for both GPS and our system.  They did this not out of the goodness of their heart, but because of the news about the tax introduced, in the amount of 25%, on all devices that do not support GLONASS, which became known in 2011.  This was a kind of preparation of the soil, for today's measures, the support of the domestic producer.  The experiment, one might say, was a success, and the leading phone developers began incorporating this feature into their devices.  At the price, this is not much reflected as the operation is not laborious and does not imply the rejection of the time-tested GPS.

    <h6>  Can we compete? </h6><br>  The government, a year ago, <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/537435">promised to</a> improve the system, which should have been achieved, by introducing a new version of the geocentric coordinate system: <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%2597-90">PZ-90</a> , which is analogous to the western <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS84">WGS84</a> .  In addition to this system, from 2012 to 2020, 320 billion rubles was allocated from the budget of the Russian Federation for the development of GLONASS.  During this period, it is planned to manufacture 15 Glonass-M satellites and 22 Glonass-K satellites.  All these <s>easy money</s> budget funds turned the head of the General Staff of the Russian Federation and he <a href="http://ria.ru/defense_safety/20111028/473558316.html">said</a> that by 2015, in accuracy, GLONASS will not yield to GPS.  It only remains to hope that it will happen and be afraid of <s>spending budget funds</s> in addition to lagging behind GPS, competing with new players, on a geodetic map - European Galileo and the Chinese Compass program. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201258/</a></p>
