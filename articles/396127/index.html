  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft announced a new distribution model for Windows 10, now by subscription</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What has long been suspected and said finally happened, Microsoft at the Worldwide Partner conference announced the appearance of a new Windows 10 distribution model - now corporate users will be able to get Windows 10 Enterprise E3 through the Cloud Solution Provider cloud service on a subscription basis.  The cost of this option will be $ 7 per month for one job. <a name="habracut"></a>  And not only large corporations, but also small and medium businesses will be able to use the Enterprise version of the operating system.  According to Microsoft representatives, this will allow small and medium-sized businesses, including increasing their competitiveness due to the possibility of using those security developments that were previously available only to large companies, as well as optimizing their software costs, enabling them to respond flexibly to changes in the structure of the company, the number of employees and not freezing the funds for a one-time purchase of licenses. <br>  While these changes are voiced only for the corporate sector, as for individual users, the new model will not be applied there yet, although it is most likely that it will be introduced in this market segment after the run-in with corporate clients. <br>  A similar step, albeit so far only in the corporate segment, shows that Microsoft is actually gradually moving towards making its operating system a service.  Such a solution is very logical for the company, and has a number of advantages, such as a stable and permanent income, which will generate a subscription scheme, greater control over the operating system's renewability by the company, the ability to reduce piracy, since the subscription scheme will in any case we need constant checks on the validity of subscriptions, and so on, there are some advantages for businesses that are the first customers of this program.  On the other hand, for individual users, as opposed to corporate users, the minuses of the subscription model are exactly the same as advantages for Microsoft itself - the need to pay the subscription on a permanent basis, linking to the company's servers, and so on. <br>  The success of this model in the individual market will depend primarily on the strategy that Microsoft chooses, but most likely the subscription will come here sooner or later, the most logical strategy may be a gradual replacement of OEM licenses to the subscription service, but for this reason the company keeps silence, so most likely, the emergence of a subscription to the operating system in this segment of the market is still a matter, though not very soon, but still probably inevitable. </div>
