  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Today Isaac Asimov would have turned 95 years old</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Isaac Yudovich Ozimov was born on January 2, 1920 in the village of Petrovichi, Smolensk region.  He was a popularizer of science, a biochemist and a writer who gave the world about 500 art books in the genres of science fiction, fantasy and detective stories, as well as popular science.  Isaac Asimov belongs to the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù science fiction writers along with <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/243007/">Arthur Clarke</a> and Robert Heinlein. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f75/8af/2e9/f758af2e93008ecc1075cf9554025fe4.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first story published by Isaac Asimov was ‚ÄúCaptured by Vesta,‚Äù published in Amazing Stories in 1939.  Two years later, another story was published that made the writer famous - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8">‚ÄúThe Coming of Night‚Äù</a> , or ‚ÄúAnd Darkness Came‚Äù in some Russian editions.  This work was one of the most famous stories ever published, and in 1968 was recognized as the best fantasy story ever written.  The story tells about the planet Kalgash, where night falls in 2049 years and the entire civilization dies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/664/fb4/bee/664fb4bee38c651b92969877e6bf6170.jpg" width="600" alt="image">

      Azimov began writing about robots in 1939: it was Robbie.  Later, in 1941, the Liar was written about a robot reading thoughts.  It is here that the laws of robotics, which were finally formulated in the 1942 story ‚ÄúRound Dance‚Äù, begin to appear.  And in 1986, the Zero Law was proposed in the novel "Robots and Empire".  The laws of robotics have become a unifying theme for science fiction by Isaac Asimov.  The collection of stories "I, Robot" brought world-famous writer. <br><br><blockquote>  0. A robot cannot harm humanity or, through its inaction, allow harm to humanity. <br>  1. A robot cannot harm a person or by its inaction allow a person to be harmed. <br>  2. A robot must obey all orders that a person gives, except when these orders conflict with the First Law. <br>  3. A robot must take care of its security to the extent that it is not contrary to the First and Second Laws. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f8/25a/7f0/5f825a7f03ffcedec4b0f9bc10ca08f5.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1942, the series of novels ‚ÄúThe Foundation‚Äù was launched, the world of which was combined in 1980 with stories about robots.  Now <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/241274/">John Nolan is working on the script for the</a> series on this series of novels.  Since 1958, Azimov began to write more popular science literature. <br><br>  But what did he like most about himself?  Azimov's favorite stories were ‚ÄúThe Last Question,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Bicentennial Man,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Ugly Boy,‚Äù and the favorite novel was ‚ÄúThe Gods themselves.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Screen versions </h4><br>  On New Year's holidays, you have great news to watch your favorite movies based on the works of Isaac Asimov. <br><br><h4>  Bicentennial man </h4><br>  You can start with the "Bicentennial Man", filmed in 1999.  The main role in this film, filmed on ‚ÄúPositron Man‚Äù (which, in turn, is based on the short story ‚ÄúThe Bicentennial Man‚Äù), was played by Robin Williams. <br><br>  The film tells about the robot Andrew, model NDR-114, which studies humanity and seeks questions.  He realizes that he himself becomes a man, and begins to turn himself into him physically.  For two hundred years he has been on this path, trying through court to achieve recognition as a man, and yet he will do it, albeit at the cost of his own life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/991/bab/22f/991bab22fdba27b3b86afecb408e4f20.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c4/9f4/d8a/1c49f4d8a6fc0a050cf71b0403542417.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  I am a robot </h4><br>  In 2004, the movie ‚ÄúI, Robot‚Äù was released, in which the main role was played by Will Smith.
