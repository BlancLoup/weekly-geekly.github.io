    <ul><li>  The total prize fund is 1 300 000 rubles. </li><li>  Special partners from prizes and gifts. </li><li>  The opportunity to conclude contracts with partner companies of the forum. </li></ul><br><h3>  <b>Examples of ideas for projects</b> <br></h3><br>  Participants are encouraged to develop services for the selection of mentors, tracking efficiency and optimization of mentoring processes.  A variety of ideas are welcome, below is a selection of examples. <br><br><h3>  Matching </h3><br>  Search and selection of everything and everything.  Each creature in a pair, as they say.  For example, the search for mentors for specialists and projects, the collection of teams for the project, the search for employees and consultants for specific projects.  Not only the Dalai Lama or Zuckerberg can be a mentor, but also your boss or a colleague from a neighboring department - so all these tasks overlap strongly with the direction of HR in the corporate sector, where many technological startups have recently appeared. <br><br>  To solve such problems, we will need methods of machine learning and digital profiles with summaries, descriptions, linking to social networks and food photos from the insta, data on the number of hours spent in Fb and Hearthstone behind a working computer - everything we find.  By the way, the compilation of this profile and the aggregation of information is also a fairly large-scale field for projects that can be worked on within the framework of the hackathon. <br><br>  Organizers and partners will help us with the data - corporations and well-known job search services (SuperJob, HeadHunter) and employees will set the tasks for the participants, which we will announce later.  Be sure to use all sorts of open data, for example, with GitHub.  If we are looking for a guru who would suit our project, then we can try to select a programmer by code in open repositories, a mentor for a startup on the history of a business angel or a journalist on his works in the public domain. <br><br>  Of course, in such a story, we are interested not only in the effectiveness of selection, but also in its convenience: how to assemble teams for a project, how to search the database for a summary of the query ‚Äúexperienced PR man with ICO experience‚Äù, how to search for those who work together with our despot technicians in the project to create a chat bot for technical support - all these questions to you, gentlemen. <br><br>  The main thing is not to forget that for a little bit of an effective match the diversity of those whom we will match is crucial.  So, it is worth thinking about the motivation, the reward system and the involvement of people in this very mentoring - gamify, train, monitor, support the community, etc ... For example, CROC has such a system of encouraging mentoring among employees: they receive in the form of receiving the domestic currency that you can spend on nice bonuses. <br><br><h3>  AI Boss </h3><br>  Everything about automating mentoring processes.  Many of the tasks of a mentor are a routine: check that at least someone commits something somewhere, ping procrasting specialists, check that communication has not left the productive channel, etc.  There are plenty of options, up to the fact that one fine morning, Gennady, Alice's friend, will not just fire you, but also recommend how to utilize your biomass as profitably as possible. <br><br>  To begin with, we will believe in the good thoughts of our employer mentors and their attempts to contribute to our career growth within the company.  Somewhere an assistant may appear who will help managers and HR managers to find you the right projects, the right team, the right online course, the right transitions between departments, the right wife and the ottoman - well, what if.  He will help you understand why you are bored or want to quit, and will try to offer you or your manager a couple of ways how to make you happy again and whether you should: increase your salary, offer to become a designer instead of a programmer or change an ottoman. <br><br>  How exactly to implement the good intentions of leadership?  Let's immediately cover a whole bunch of assistants to increase the effectiveness of mentoring and communication: <br><br><ul><li>  Meetings and calls ‚Äî generating summaries of correspondence, meeting notes and interviews; </li><li>  Reports, documentation, letters, presentations, rules - assessment of quality and compliance with formal requirements, recommendations for improving materials, adaptation to corporate standards or rules. </li><li>  Task trackers, chat rooms, bug trackers - automate the formation of status and alerts, assess productivity and quality of communication. </li><li>  Quantified self - selection of optimal conditions (correlation of the amount of sleep and a graph with productivity, etc.) </li><li>  And much more. </li></ul><br>  By the way, pay attention to the work with feedback and evaluation of the quality of mentoring and how security is ensured in working with minors in education and the social sphere. <br><br>  In addition to the above, we advise, for example, to consider the various functions of a project mentor, specialist or student and try to understand whether something can be improved or save his time by automating or using machine learning methods or any other. <br><br>  Having a large base of different career paths and vacancies, one can learn to model professional development with the help of machine learning methods.  In particular, to help a specialist choose the right step at the current career point and recommend industries, projects, vacancies.  Those who take on this task are awaited by a special unit with a prize of 500,000 rubles from the SuperJob. <br><br>  You can also choose a young startup for his description of contests, funds, accelerators and other useful programs around the world - to start with and without a person.  It seems that filling out a frightening grant application with tips based on the history of the competition will be a little easier. <br><br>  That's it.  In general, it is better to forget now what you read, turn on your brain and fantasy and do it your own way - everything is possible.  Write to us about any forms of participation, ideas, plans, etc.  - we will help, work together and look at how to make mentoring digital and beautiful and get rid of the aging advice of coach Kohli on how to be a man and girls from the neighboring yard to fool. <br><br>  You can be inspired in numerous articles about why Edtech will turn Makarenko in the coffin, why you need to fire all Hr-s, how Google takes into account the history of search queries when hiring and other bikes - or better in more serious HRTech reviews with trends and links to successful startups . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A few stateek</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-your-new-boss-an-algorithm-1512910800">Meet Your New Boss: An Algorithm</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-your-new-boss-an-algorithm-1512910800"><br></a> <br>  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-ai-chatbot-will-hire-you-now/">The AI ‚Äã‚ÄãChatbot will hire you now</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-ai-chatbot-will-hire-you-now/"><br></a> <br>  <a href="https://special.theoryandpractice.ru/mentors">There is always a person who does something better than you: how the institution of mentoring works</a> <a href="https://special.theoryandpractice.ru/mentors"><br></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.dataversity.net/fascinating-artificial-intelligence-story-robot-boss/">An Artificial Intelligence Story: The Robot Boss and Data Operations</a> <a href="http://www.dataversity.net/fascinating-artificial-intelligence-story-robot-boss/"><br></a> <br>  <a href="https://www.inc.com/avi-savar/3-ways-that-ai-is-transforming-hr-and-recruiting.html">3 Ways That AI Is Transforming HR and Recruiting</a> <a href="https://www.inc.com/avi-savar/3-ways-that-ai-is-transforming-hr-and-recruiting.html"><br></a> <br>  <a href="https://rb.ru/story/HR-tech-future/">What technologies are needed in HR?</a> <a href="https://rb.ru/story/HR-tech-future/"><br></a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/295230/">8 successful people sharing experience: how to find a mentor?</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/295230/"><br></a> <br>  <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/9-top-platforms-for-finding-a-mentor-in-2016.html">9 Top Platforms for Finding a Mentor</a> <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/9-top-platforms-for-finding-a-mentor-in-2016.html"><br></a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/potok/blog/323342/">What's going on in the world of HR technology: 9 startups and tools that are worth watching</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/potok/blog/323342/"><br></a> <br>  <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/18/ai-could-help-your-boss-track-your-performance-for-better-or-for-worse/">For help or for worse</a> <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/18/ai-could-help-your-boss-track-your-performance-for-better-or-for-worse/"><br></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/karera-i-svoy-biznes/342639-ruka-pomoshchi-tri-mifa-o-nastavnichestve-v-rossii">Helping hand: three myths about mentoring in Russia</a> <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/karera-i-svoy-biznes/342639-ruka-pomoshchi-tri-mifa-o-nastavnichestve-v-rossii"><br></a> <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347772/</a></p>
