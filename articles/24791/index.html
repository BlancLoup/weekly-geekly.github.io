  <section class="page js-page"><h1>If you want to attract investment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In February last year, a venture fund was opened in the MSU Science Park, which invests in Internet start-ups.  I want to tell you about how we worked and what experience we learned. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First, as we were looking for projects.  At the very beginning, it was decided not to promote and work non-publicly (in fact, this is how many investment funds work).  This was done in order to avoid the influx of inadequate people.  We independently searched for projects that are interesting for us, head-handedness and motivated people who want to leave a large company and raise their project. <br><br>  The conditions on which the investment was provided were different and depended on the specific situation, namely, on such factors: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      ‚Ä¢ The stage at which the project was located (idea, prototype, beta version). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Commands (there is only a manager, a full team). <br>  ‚Ä¢ The amount of funds required to create a prototype, launch and initial promotion (we provided $ 50k - $ 150k). <br>  In addition, naturally, the decision was made after analyzing the project - the potential market volume, business model (what the service planned to earn), the demand for such a service among users (based on foreign experience, questionnaires and common sense). <br><br>  In general, in order to attract investment, you need to consider a few things.  First, investment funds do not steal ideas.  It is much more important to find a team that can raise the project.  But if you come and say that you are not ready to share the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour project, they will not talk to you for a long time.  Secondly, if you want to receive money for a project, get ready to share a stake in the business (which depends on the principles of the foundation‚Äôs work).  Thirdly, it is not worthwhile to mortgage large salaries, arguing that you could earn such a sum in such and such a company.  First of all, you are a co-owner of a business, and you are not hired for work.  And of course, you should not count on cash out, this is possible only at a late stage of project development. <br>  As a result, several projects were invested over the year, of which only <a href="http://www.mooteam.ru/">mooteam.ru</a> is currently available to the <a href="http://www.mooteam.ru/">public</a> , for the last 2 months I have been fully engaged in them. <br><br>  So, my conclusions: <br><br>  The success of the project is 90% dependent on the management of the project, the remaining 10% - good luck, an idea and so on. <br>  For success, it is not enough to make a technically good service, you need to understand how you will promote it until attendance starts to grow.  However, this works only with projects with a certain social component, many services require a constant influx of users - you need to understand what methods this will be achieved. <br>  You should not go into too much operational management; sometimes you have to look at a project from the point of view of working out / adjusting the strategy. <br><br>  I hope someone will be useful, happy to answer all questions. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24791/</a></p>
