Using Teensy's HID devices, Nikhil will demonstrate how you can effortlessly crack an operating system using the property of modern OSs to perceive input devices as safe by default.  It will also discuss the use of Teensy for keyboard emulation. <br><br>  In addition, the master class participants will be presented with a package of Kautilya tools, designed to facilitate the work of experts during penetration testing.  This package contains convenient, easily customizable tools, and the user of the package does not even need to program. <br><br>  The master class will include many demonstrations. <br><br>  <b>Host:</b> <a href="http://twitter.com/">Nikhil Mittal</a> is an Indian hacker, researcher and enthusiast who actively participates in the development of information security.  His areas of interest include the study of attacks and defense strategies, the study of the results of hacking.  For more than three years, he has been conducting penetration tests for government organizations in India, and at the moment his services are used by large international corporations. <br><br>  Nikhil specializes in assessing the security of information systems;  This requires a non-standard approach to finding new attack vectors and fresh defense solutions.

To effectively use such tools, it is not enough for an administrator to simply read the documentation.  The enemy must be known in person, and various means of protection help to detect or warn only some very well-defined attacks from among those that are in the arsenal of a trained attacker.  The purpose of this report is to give listeners the opportunity to look at the issues of wireless network protection both in the eyes of a hacker and in the eyes of a system administrator. <br><br>  During the presentation, the most relevant methods of obtaining unauthorized access to the Wi-Fi network will be considered, and the mechanisms proposed by the comprehensive Cisco Unified Wireless Network to protect against these attacks will be demonstrated.  This will allow listeners to consciously determine which set of protection functions they need. <br><br>  <b>Moderator</b> - Dmitry Ryzhavsky.

It is surprising that in the security industry this threat was not given enough attention, despite the fact that there are already hundreds of different modifications of the program.  It turned out that the virus is installed only on the victim computer, where it most likely comes after a network attack.  Presumably, this malware is used by people who want to steal private information from infected computers.  The master of the master class will talk about the functionality of such programs. <br><br>  <b>Moderator:</b> Pierre-Marc Bureau is a researcher and specialist in the field of information system security.
