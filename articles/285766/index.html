Get on Apple</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e04/1d4/375/e041d4375a4a4be59e29d9b257904244.jpg"><br><br>  Doug Field never seriously considered leaving his workplace at Apple.  From the summer of 2008 to the fall of 2013, Doug was actively working on the hardware design of such company's products as MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and iMac.  He received an excellent salary and was pleased with his work.  But then Ilon Musk called and invited Dag to become vice president of the transportation program.  Doug Field could not refuse the offer. <br><br>  In October 2013, Field said that Tesla‚Äôs work is "a great opportunity for me and many other people who have the dream of building the best cars in the world, being part of one of the most innovative companies in Silicon Valley." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is worth noting that Doug is far from being the only Apple employee who went to work at Tesla.  At the moment, this company has already lured away more than 150 ex-Apple employees.  From other companies in Tesla passed much less people.  Ilon Musk believes that Apple has a very close Tesla design philosophy, which is why the company entices employees.

Those Apple employees who went to work at Tesla say they did it because of their sympathy for Tesla‚Äôs cars and the head of Tesla, Ilon Mask.  Mask's reputation is no worse than the one that Steve Jobs has earned.  Some Tesla employees believe that Ilon Musk is fascinated by Apple and its principles of work. <br><br>  It should be noted that the control display of Tesla cars was developed by former employees of Apple.  One employee, Joe Naxoll, says that working on this project was more like working on an iPhone, rather than working on a Ford car.  Joe knows what he says because he worked at both Apple and Ford. <br><br>  One of the first Apple employees to switch to Tesla is George Blankenship.  He worked at Apple to create a network of retailers, after which Mask invited him to work to perform a similar series of tasks.  ‚ÄúEverything Tesla does is unique to the automotive industry,‚Äù says Blankenship, who earned $ 1.2 million in 2012.  By the way, fulfilling the goal, Blankenship left Tesla in 2013. <br><br>  If you look at LinkedIn profiles, then at Tesla you can see such ex-Apple employees: Rick Healey, who joined the automotive company in 2013, Lynn Miller, who became an employee of Tesla last year, Beth Lab Davis (2011) and Nick Kalaygin, who switched to work at Tesla back in 2006.  These employees now occupy high positions at Tesla Motors, although at Apple they were not the last people. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIlon explained to me why it is easy for him to hire someone from Apple.  This is because when he starts interviewing such a person, they quickly find a common language, since he and the other are geeks, people who are slightly obsessed with their work, ‚Äùsays Jonas, an associate of Morgan Stanley. <br><br>  The similarity of Apple and Tesla, not only in industrial design and work with people.  The principle of operation of Tesla chain stores and operating activities of the company are very similar to their counterparts at Apple.  Even the decision to build a ‚ÄúBattery Gig Factory‚Äù could be seen as a repetition of Apple‚Äôs actions when the company bought an industrial site in Mesa, Arizona, 2013. <br><br>  Interestingly, more recently, Apple has begun a similar policy, trying to poach Tesla employees.  Thus, employees are offered 250 thousand dollars as a bonus and a salary increase of 60%.  But, according to Ilona Mask, so far Apple has managed to lure very few Tesla employees. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285766/</a></p>
