The owner of the provider Internet Technical Center JSC will also be changed, 75% of which belongs to the coordination center, and the remaining 25% to the Internet Development Fund. <br><br>  Kommersant cites information from its own sources, according to which at a meeting of representatives of the FSB, Roskomnadzor, the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Tax Service the latter were put before the fact of a change in the owner of KC and TCI.

      The essence of nationalization is reduced to a change of ownership and redirecting the financial flows of the KC to the state.  The total financial flow through the KC is estimated for the year at 540 million rubles, of which 120 million are received by the Internet Development Fund in the form of license fees, and another 420 million by the KC itself.  These amounts are formed from user fees for the renewal and registration of domains in the areas controlled by CC. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Presidential Aide Igor Schegolev is lobbying the option in which Rostelecom will manage the Coordination Center, and the deputy director.  Head of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media Alexey Sokolov proposes to transfer the powers of the Scientific Research Institute "Voskhod". <br><br>  In addition to the redistribution of a profitable asset in the form of a KC, a replacement is also being prepared for the current leadership of the center.  Already in December of this year, Stanislav Puginsky, a partner of the Egorov Afanasyev, Puginsky and Partners law firm, may take his place. <br><br>  The main reason for which KC will continue to exist instead of completely disbanding and directly delegating its authority to the structure necessary for the government is the possible difficulties with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN">ICANN</a> - the organization controlling global network domains, as well as regulating issues of providing IP addresses and other issues related with the functioning of the network.  ICANN was created with the support of the US government, however, it positions itself as an international non-profit organization. <br><br>  The dismantling of the Coordination Center with the subsequent transfer of functions to the government structures could cause a conflict with ICANN, which, in the long term, would jeopardize the functioning of the Russian network segment.  That is why it was decided to leave the ‚Äúscreen‚Äù in the person of the KC, and transfer control over it to government organizations through the right of ownership.  In addition, the KC had been under the control of the Ministry of Communications before that.  In 2015, the ministry joined the founders of the Coordination Center.  Now his leadership is working taking into account the views of all the founders of the organization, that is, including taking into account the wishes of the Ministry of Communications. <br><br>  There were no conflicts in the course of the work of the KC and the state before this, so the main reason for the change of ownership is precisely the redirection of financial flows in favor of interested companies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396825/</a></p>
