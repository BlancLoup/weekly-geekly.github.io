  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ended four-letter domains in the COM zone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The end of the week was marked by a historic event.  In the COM zone, the free four-letter domains have ended;  domains of the form LLLL.com, where L is any letter of the Latin alphabet.  Now, those who wish to register a short 4-letter domain in the COM zone will not be able to do this, since all domains are occupied. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The event that happened was the reason for the joy of numerous cybersquatters who managed to register four-letter letters in time.  The fact that there are no free four-letter domains in the COM zone automatically means an increase in the market value of such domains in the secondary market. <br><br>  It should be noted that meaningful four-letter domains, representing any more or less well-known abbreviation or abbreviation (and even more so any word of four letters, in any language), ended a long time ago, and recently cybersquatters (or domainers , depending on the point of view of this business, even frankly meaningless combinations of letters were willingly registered. <br><br>  A simple arithmetic calculation shows that there are a total of 456,976 four-letter domains in the .com zone (as in any other zone based on the Latin alphabet).  This number is obtained by erecting 26 (the exact number of letters in the Latin alphabet) to the fourth power.

      As early as October 1, in the COM zone there were about 12.5 thousand free four-letter domains.  By October 31, there were about 2.5 thousand of them, and on November 2 they ended.  The last registered four-letter letters in the COM zone represented such nonsense as xvqg.com, vxkq.com, qvxg.com, xvgq.com, vxqf.com.  However, despite this, the newly-minted owners happily reported on the dominer forums about the successful capture of the last fours. <br><br>  In order to achieve such a result, the COM zone took 22 years - the zone was opened in 1985, and the first four-letter domains (ccur.com and quad.com) were registered on December 11, 1986 (these two domains are in the hundred of the oldest COM zones; the entire list can be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.com" title="here">here</a> ). <br><br>  On September 17, the millionth domain was registered in the RU zone.  However, despite the fact that this number is about 70 times less than the total number of registered domains in the COM zone, there is already a clear shortage of meaningful four-letter domains that are free for registration in the RU zone.  Almost all the four-letter in RU, representing an abbreviation or abbreviation, having at least some commercial value, are already occupied. <br><br>  Speaking of four-letter domains, it can be said (and this will be true for shorter domain names) that not only domain names that represent a word have commercial value, but also names that are a combination of letters that coincide with the abbreviation of a name or firms, organizations, projects, products, etc.  In general, we can say that the more well-known and popular this abbreviation is, the higher the domain cost will be for a potential buyer (in fact, this question is more complicated, because the cost of short domain names in the secondary domain market, in addition to the popularity of the letter combination, determined by a number of other factors, in particular, the so-called quality of the letters that make up this abbreviation is assessed: the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P , R, S, T are considered premium letters, J, K, U, V, W are less valuable, and the letters Q, X, Y, Z are the least quoted  ; This scale is due to the fact that most of the names of various companies and products begins with the premium letters in connection with which a domain name consisting of the letters will be more in demand by potential buyers in the face of these firms and producers). <br><br>  At present, it is difficult to make any accurate prediction as to when exactly the last four-letter domain will be registered in the RU zone, but we can already assume that this moment will come much earlier than it happened in the COM zone.  This conclusion is primarily due to the fact that some cybersquatters, focusing on the steadily observed increase in prices for domains in the COM zone, specialize in registering large volumes of four-letter domains in the RU zone, understanding that with time such domains will only become more expensive. <br><br>  It is also worth noting that the free three-letter domains in the RU zone ended about two years ago.  At the same time, those who registered even the most ‚Äúcurve‚Äù three-letter domain two years ago (that is, a domain whose name consists of letters that are not listed on the domain market) now have the opportunity to sell their domain 10 times more expensive.  Buyers will be cybersquatters-dealers who hunt for ‚Äúthrees‚Äù for the purpose of resale to other cybersquatters or, if lucky, to the end user, i.e.  the end user acquiring a domain in order to create an Internet project on it (the term end-user, from English end user, moved into the domain business from the economy, from where it came and into computer science). <br><br>  Two-letter domains in the RU zone ended even earlier, in 2003, and at present the average market price for a two-letter RU is from $ 8,000 to $ 20,000 (this amount is not the limit).  In the COM zone, the last two-letter was registered in 1995, and the price of the worst of these domains is now measured in a six-figure sum. <br><br>  <em>(c) softodrom.ru</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15771/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15771/</a></p>
