So that such a nice holiday should not be wasted, as they say.  And to set an example, several of our employees made themselves geek suits.  We want to tell about the process of their manufacture. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Rubik's Cube </h4><br>  We started from the very simple suit that we chose for the contest - the Rubik's cube suit.  To begin with, the girl who will wear it has taken measurements.  Then they took several sheets of extruded polystyrene, buttted them together and cut the details: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6a/0be/fe2/c6a0befe2fba4402846c6f1d9e9646dd.jpg">

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd4/fad/710/fd4fad7105c547ce86e066d17d61474c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c66/fd5/e1a/c66fd5e1a93f4b3084ada22e549febc5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bf/bcd/61b/8bfbcd61bac64afeaf89879ec9c3c50f.jpg"><br><br>  We collected three "boxes", denoting the levels of the cube.  Then pasted them with colored paper, connected with adhesive tape from the inside and made straps for hanging on the shoulders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bc/d1c/ac1/4bcd1cac177f45999b878c7c4dcf71c4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/546/77f/01a/54677f01a9de4d3e8a35d9b8f4a45591.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Lego-man </h4><br>  Still, Lego - an amazing phenomenon.  It would seem a children's toy, but there is in it some kind of charm that attracts us, even when we grow up.  You never know what toys we played in childhood, but we don‚Äôt forget about Lego.  After all, it has long become a kind of symbol of creativity.  By the way, in our office even a huge logo has a surface to which hundreds of Lego figures are attached: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMjKXlim7ZY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLvXHP-bZ2voSPjjan7HEFjcSSzA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Therefore, we decided to pay tribute to this toy, and make a costume based on.  We chose the classic figure as the initial model: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f5/71f/b2e/1f571fb2e9a947488ae3e01d7d03fabc.jpg"><br><br>  We started with all the same extruded polystyrene sheet.  They estimated the height and width of the "body", cut out the parts and glued together with tape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/494/b96/4b8/494b964b83514fe69d16d88a6bff61f5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aae/20f/eca/aae20feca1e949b39b6f87a41c9c3d28.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/303/909/591/30390959131448da9574c9dda5ba52eb.jpg"><br><br>  Then from the corrugated cardboard (large packaging boxes) cut parts for hand-clips-grips, as it is more correct to call them.  In general, we went too far in size, and our hands turned out to be too big.  But overall not bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/477/fc2/494/477fc24941224eea9665f2242360950c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b9/58b/6a9/7b958b6a955942859881501a4a812f4b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0b/713/fa4/e0b713fa46e0411baf9384763d7c8b6f.jpg"><br><br>  Still, reinforced tape - a great invention! <br><br>  Then came the most difficult - making the head.  We simply thought that it was wrong to make a cylinder; I really wanted to convey this characteristic rounding from above.  The solution was found simple: they took a plate of frisbee and fastened it with adhesive tape to a cardboard cylinder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd7/de7/943/bd7de79431b749c5be5fa15824687286.jpg"><br><br>  Then they took two rolls of colored self-adhesive film, yellow and green, and pasted over the case, the head and the hands of the suit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6c/50d/3c0/f6c50d3c0e194d54a3b6d34703bda291.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/166/1bc/77e/1661bc77eeb84262b40a079a96e3e391.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/202/2a3/27f/2022a327f020446ba9a84632944dd92b.jpg"><br><br>  At the end of the marker for the boards painted physiognomy.  The mouth is cut out, through him the costume carrier will look at the world.  And so that the gap fell just opposite the eyes, several stacks of polystyrene pieces were stuck to the bottom to reduce the depth of the ‚Äúhead‚Äù of the suit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc2/389/b27/bc2389b27c6b46c9ae0ac693eda3a006.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b7/484/5ac/9b74845ac9bc4c6f830a70854c1afab3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Suit "wanted to do in the style of Tron, but did not work" </h4><br>  Initially, the idea was this: buy a few meters of neon cord and draw a pattern to glow in the dark.  Something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f3/fba/074/6f3fba07428f4ac293be75a3f730c4fd.jpg"><br><br>  Then the idea was transformed into the creation of a costume based on the movie "Tron": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/331/6fe/3ac/3316fe3ac9ea4a4abf5e9831433c5e91.jpg"><br><br>  On that and decided.  Our colleague, an avid motorcyclist, agreed to participate in our performance and provided his helmet and motorcycle jacket.  We even found a toy disk for him, flickering with LEDs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/732/dc0/1e5/732dc01e58f348ad9b08c904bf5e758e.jpg"><br><br>  We chose a blue cord for our costume so that it was closer to the corporate color: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0dc/69f/e76/0dc69fe766ec41168d83ccf091c0119b.jpg"><br><br>  Beautiful, is not it?  But it turned out that all this beauty works only in the dark.  Even dim external lighting completely "clogs" the brightness of the cord, and its light seems to fade. <br><br>  It's a shame, but there is nothing to do - because the costume contest will not take place in the dark.  Maybe there are brighter neon cord options available, but we never found anything like that.  As a result, we decided to do some kind of abstraction, and pasted over the helmet and jacket with LED tape.  Its brightness is enough to kill any external light. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d28/bb2/4af/d28bb24afa214a84af840cbdcca5db08.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d95/66e/4eb/d9566e4ebc8c46449ca1be4387896ac1.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Robot bender </h4><br>  And finally, the fourth costume that we made, we like the most.  We decided to make the character Futurama, whose name went down in history thanks to the immortal proverb "... with blackjack and ...!".  Thank you for her, Bender! <br><br>  So, got down to work.  To begin with, they made a large cylinder of a robot body from a corrugated cardboard: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21f/cb7/38e/21fcb738ebed4ca8802a6d70397620d9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/747/95b/7bc/74795b7bc9e744cba63dc2f84f2cd0d8.jpg"><br><br>  Then cut the door: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4df/7da/91a/4df7da91ad824ee4b1c63752e0316e36.jpg"><br><br>  Then they made an internal niche where you can put bottles of ... juice, and pasted over the whole body with strips of reinforced adhesive tape to convey the characteristic gray color of Bender: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/414/6d2/f4d/4146d2f4d4194e62a3808074c4aab530.jpg"><br><br>  It took more than four rolls, by the way. <br><br>  Then we thought hard, how can we make Bender's head?  After all, the crown is in his hemisphere.  Different options were offered, but in the end they did it like this: they took a basketball, wrapped it in a plastic bag, and plastered it with improvised papier-m√¢ch√© from paper towels soaked with PVA paper glue on top: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dea/c25/562/deac255621774f77b072b27b0b0d639a.jpg"><br><br>  When all this fear has dried, on top of it pasted over with stripes of the same reinforced adhesive tape.  Then they neatly cut it to make a hemisphere, and attached it to a cardboard cylinder: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/466/bd4/425/466bd4425b174ac38a5ca7b5a802ceb8.jpg"><br><br>  Primary fitting: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f1/6e0/16c/0f16e016cb5c410fabdbbdaf716ec9a1.jpg"><br><br>  The head was obviously long, so we cut it from the bottom.  With the help of two small furniture hinges, the door was suspended and a magnetic furniture latch with a circular handle was fitted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bfc/f62/328/bfcf623280e94c61abda7ac2f78151d6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd9/58e/53c/cd958e53cf8041258b9ed550f35912f9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b9/ba5/817/7b9ba5817dc74783be6ec743b2eacc88.jpg"><br><br>  Bender's eyes were made of a soft ball cut in half, the surface of which was simply sanded, removing a glossy layer with a pattern.  From the cardboard turned "fencing" for the eyes.  The mouth was cut out, a mosquito net was glued in and a characteristic three rows of teeth were drawn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8d/59c/501/b8d59c501a3e40b9b7beacc53d179586.jpg"><br><br>  Antenna made of aluminum tube and ball for table tennis. <br><br>  It turned out very well: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c79/fb5/099/c79fb5099fb24ef1a16b0c5bcf7994b7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cf/e61/c89/1cfe61c89bb740b29605246e0ff7091f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0c/cf4/05b/b0ccf405bc044d8fa0f141dba04a7068.jpg"><br><br>  We hope we inspired you to make your own costumes!  As you can see, no special skill is required, and it is not at all necessary to invest big money or to be a level 80 seamstress. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362307/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362307/</a></p>
