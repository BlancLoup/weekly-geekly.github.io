Characteristics of new products Lenovo regularly surfaced long before the official announcements.  An employee of Lenovo <a href="http://lenovoblogs.com/insidethebox/%3Fp%3D133">wrote</a> about this in the official blog that working with large corporate clients does not allow to release a product in complete secrecy, unlike some other companies. <br><br>  The existing lines of T, R and X have undergone updating, and new ones have been added: SL (Small Business) and W (Workstation). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  ThinkPad T-series </h2>

      The T61 has been replaced by the T400 and T500, with 14.1 "and 15.4" widescreen displays, respectively. <br><br>  New laptops have technology to switch between integrated graphics and Intel discrete graphics card, familiar to us from the Sony VAIO SZ.  The short period of using NVIDIA graphics began with the T61 and ended with it, and Lenovo returned to ATI (AMD) products.  The T400 uses the Mobility Radeon HD3470 graphics card, the T500 uses the HD3650, both with 256 MB of video memory. <br><br>  In the options appeared screens with LED-backlit.  T400 will be equipped with screens with a resolution of 1280x800 and 1440x900, and the T500 - 1280x800 and 1680x1050.  Screens, of course, only matte. <br><br>  Another expected novelty was the appearance of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort">DisplayPort</a> connector in a 15-inch model.  Thus, Lenovo just waited for the era of DVI, causing a lot of complaints from buyers who did not like the need to buy a docking station to connect a desktop monitor via a digital interface.  It should be noted that the outdated VGA port remained in place, and the motivation for this has not changed: ThinkPad notebooks are targeted at business users who regularly need an analog connection to the projector. <br><br>  Laptops are equipped with all conceivable wireless interfaces: WWAN with integrated GPS, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_USB">UWB</a> , WiMAX (will be available later this year), not to mention Wi-Fi 802.11n and Bluetooth. <br><br>  For a T400 with a 4-cell battery, a weight of 2.1 kg is claimed, which is slightly less than 2.3 kg for a 14-inch T61, but most likely the first value is indicated with a plug in UltraBay instead of an optical drive.  The T500 weighs 2.7 kg.  The lifetime of the T400 from a 9-cell battery will be about 10 hours, and with an additional battery in UltraBay - up to 13 hours!  Even if you allow the double digging numbers from Lenovo, the result is quite decent. <br><br>  The appearance in comparison with the T61 has not changed, even caused affection fans with the experience of red stripes on the trackpoint keys, as in the X300, did not wait.  Under the black plastic is the same space frame made of magnesium alloy (Roll Cage), thanks to which you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DwwCO740QB4U">ride a motorcycle</a> on a laptop, <a href="http://forum.notebookreview.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D177304">drag it by the open lid</a> and do other things that ThinkPad owners like so much. <br><br><h2>  X-series </h2><br><br>  Releasing the ambitious X300 at the beginning of the year, Lenovo has now introduced a replacement for the X61 - X200 workhorse.  The main difference is the widescreen screen with a resolution of 1280x800, instead of the one used to the last in this 4: 3 series.  This step again caused a lot of controversy, but one advantage is indisputable: the increased width allowed to fit the keyboard, identical to that used in the T-series.  The touchpad is still missing, and a set of ports is impressive for an ultra-portable laptop: 3 USB, Ethernet, VGA, card reader and even a modem in some configurations.  However, the FireWire that was present in X61 disappeared.  Of the new options, a built-in webcam has appeared. <br><br>  The X200 weighs from 1.34 to 1.67 kg in configurations with a 4-, 6-, and 9-cell battery.  With the latest, NotebookReview.com managed to achieve an impressive working time of almost 10 hours with Wi-Fi on and low (but not minimal) screen brightness.  (See <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp%3FnewsID%3D4497">full review</a> ). <br><br>  The price of a novelty in the United States will start at $ 1,200. <br><br><h2>  R-series </h2><br><br>  In the budget R-series appeared R400 and R500 to replace the R61.  Appeared DisplayPort in the older model and disappeared configuration with discrete graphics, apparently migrated to a new line of SL. <br><br><h2>  SL-series </h2><br><br>  The new line is reminiscent of its focus on short-lived notebooks ThinkPad Z-series.  Three models: SL300, SL400 and SL500.  Of the distinctive features of the HDMI output and optional BluRay drive.  The GeForce 9300M graphics card with 128 MB of memory in the 13-inch model and 256 in the other two.  SL300 is equipped with a glossy screen resolution of 1280x800 with LED-backlit. <br><br><h2>  W-series </h2><br><br>  This line is designed to replace the T-series with the suffix "p" (T61p) - mobile workstations.  They use professional ATI FireGL graphics cards and high-resolution displays: 1680x1050 and 1920x1200 in the W500.  The W700, the first ThinkPad with a 17-inch screen, is equipped with only a WUXGA display with a resolution of 1920x1200.  The remaining characteristics mostly coincide with the T-series. <br><br>  <em>UPD</em> From <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/special-offers.workflow:ShowPromo%3FLandingPage%3D/All/US/Landing_pages/Info/08/Montevina%26ipromoID%3Dwna00256%26">this page</a> on the Lenovo website, you can download leaflets with photos and features that served as the basis for the material. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29278/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29278/</a></p>
