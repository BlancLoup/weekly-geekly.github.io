  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Third Party Widgets: Pros and Cons</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I will talk about such important things as the use of widgets and services of third-party sites. <br><br><h4>  Bait </h4>  It's no secret that when calculating the time of creation of a project, we put very little (negligible) time to implement the widget code of third-party sites.  For example, social buttons.  networks "I like", "+1" and the like. <br>  At a time when there were no widgets yet, each site builder did everything himself: chat, comments, the form ‚Äúsend a letter‚Äù, ‚Äúadd to favorites‚Äù, counting statistics, etc.  He spent a lot of time on it during development.  Now - we happily turn to third-party services and rejoice that "someone has already done everything for us." <br>  We regard this as an additional free functionality, with minimal labor costs for implementation, which should work ‚Äúfor us‚Äù, and not ‚Äúagainst us‚Äù ... <br><br>  Is it really?! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Widgets - do we really need them? </h4><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>BEHIND</b> </td><td>  <b>VS</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Implementation with minimal effort </td><td>  If the widget's site is unavailable, then users may have problems loading pages from your site </td></tr><tr><td>  The rapid dissemination of information in the social.  networks about the page where the widget is installed </td><td>  Collection of statistics of attendance and transitions to your site for further analysis </td></tr><tr><td>  The ability to give users the desired functionality in the shortest possible time from the entire mass of sites with widgets currently on the Internet (provided that this functionality is implemented and available as a widget) </td><td>  You will lose the direction that the widget implements.  Since  subconsciously, you decide for yourself that this is ‚Äúrealized.‚Äù </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  It can be concluded that widgets help only in the "promotion" or at the very early stages of the site, but can not replace any of the functionality that was laid in the design. <br>  Giving a part of the functionality to the widgets, we save on the initial development, but we immediately lose in development.  Having put it once, we constantly have to watch them (like ‚ÄúTamagotchi‚Äù): whether they are displayed, whether the design has changed, to constantly change the code on the site, when the widget's embed code is changed by the other side, etc.  If you add it up - it takes a lot of time.

    <h4>  A popular widget is a free advertisement. </h4><br>  When we set ourselves a widget, we automatically implement a free advertising space with ‚Äúlive‚Äù functionality.  And this is much more appreciated than any banner.  Those.  By placing the widget, we automatically help competitors to ‚Äúget around‚Äù themselves in the framework of attracting the interest of the audience to the resource. <br><br><h4>  Comparison algorithm </h4><br>  <b>From the developer‚Äôs side:</b> <br>  Install the widget is easy <br>  Implementing at home is difficult <br><br>  <b>From the user:</b> <br>  The service is available on one site - "so-so ..." <br>  The service is available on N-sites - ‚Äúoh!  I have already seen this ... I must go to their website, probably something useful if everyone puts ... " <br><br>  It turns out that everyone wants to ‚Äúquickly, efficiently and inexpensively,‚Äù but they themselves begin to ‚Äúinsert poles into the wheels,‚Äù giving preference to time to further develop the functionality of the widget to competitors, as well as visitors (traffic). <br><br><h4>  What is the main purpose of those who create widgets? </h4><br>  Free advertising, collection of statistics to assess the behavior of the audience, user-friendliness, or ‚Äúneedle fitting‚Äù, to further include paid functionality? <br><br>  Each of the above has the right to exist. <br>  The main question is: when will you find out about this - will it be completely late ?! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153539/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153539/</a></p>
