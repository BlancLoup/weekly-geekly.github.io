  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Eliza or your virtual double</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 1966, MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum wrote <a href="http://www-ai.ijs.si/eliza/eliza.html">Eliza's</a> famous program, which inspired the pioneers of artificial intelligence.  Eliza, named after the heroine of the play by Bernard Shaw ‚ÄúPygmalion‚Äù by Eliza Doolittle, was the first representative in the class of programs, which are now called virtual interlocutors (chatterbot).  She imitated a conversation with a psychotherapist, trying to isolate keywords in the interlocutor‚Äôs questions and rephrase them in her answers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You: I constantly feel dizzy. <br>  Eliza: Are you sure your head is spinning? <br>  You: Maybe I should stop drinking brandy in the morning? <br>  Eliza: Do you always drink brandy in the morning? <br>  And further in the same vein ... <br>  You can try to talk with Eliza yourself <a href="http://www-ai.ijs.si/eliza/eliza.html">here</a> or <a href="http://chayden.net/eliza/Eliza.html">here</a> (in English).  For the modern user, the stereotyped answers are obvious, and the illusion of a conversation with a real interlocutor disappears almost instantly.  But forty years ago, many of Eliza‚Äôs interlocutors believed that they were dealing with a real person. <br>  Creating a fairly sophisticated virtual companion is one of the constant motives in works on artificial intelligence.  In 1950, Alan Turing, in the article ‚ÄúComputing machinery and intelligence‚Äù, proposed using the Turing test to determine if a computer is reasonable. <br>  The test is as follows.  The judge (person) is rewritten in natural language with two interlocutors, one of whom is a person, the other is a computer program.  If the judge cannot confidently determine who is who, it is considered that the program has passed the test. <br>  Turing believed that by 2000 computers would be able to pass this test, but in fact his prediction has not yet been fulfilled. <br>  And so, in April 2007, Australians John Zakas and Lizl Kapper, who had been doing research at the interface of information technology and psychology for a long time, launched the beta version of the <a href="http://www.mycybertwin.com/">MyCyberTwin</a> website, where you can create your own Eliza - your cyber wardy and train it so that I was able to imitate you or any other real or imagined person later in online conversations. <br>  Unlike Eliza, no one here thinks that he is dealing with you, but a well-trained virtual counterpart can be online 24 hours a day and replace you when you are unavailable.  You can embed your virtual counterpart in a blog, website or your MySpace profile.  Companies can use virtual doubles to support their customers around the clock. <br>  The options for configuring the virtual double unlimited.  In addition to answers to hundreds of standard questions and replicas provided by the creators of the site, you can add an unlimited number of your own answers to the questions that your interlocutors may ask.  Records of all conversations with your virtual counterpart are saved, and based on them you can constantly tune up his behavior. <br>  The creators of <a href="http://www.mycybertwin.com/">MyCyberTwin have</a> also prepared a set of tests that clarify your views on politics, sex, religion, etc.  The information obtained from these tests is taken into account when setting the behavior of the virtual twin. <br>  <a href="http://www.mycybertwin.com/">MyCyberTwin</a> is a free service.  Each month you are allocated 500 credits, that is, with your counterpart 500 free conversations are allowed.  If there are more, you need to buy more loans. <br>  ‚ÄúPeople spend a lot of time building their online identity,‚Äù said one of the founders of <a href="http://www.mycybertwin.com/">MyCyberTwin,</a> Lizl Kapper, ‚Äúon MySpace pages, blogs, and virtual worlds such as Second Life.  Perhaps they do this for an audience of just 10 people, however, this is important for them.  Using the virtual double, you can chat with friends even while you sleep.  You can engage people in your circle and answer their questions without looking through hundreds of emails. <br>  <a href="http://www.mycybertwin.com/">MyCyberTwin</a> so far exists only in the English version, and nothing is known about plans to extend it to other languages.  Of course, you can ask Russian answers to English questions, but there is not much point in this. <br>  At the moment, 14262 virtual doubles are registered, of which 12403 are personal, 451 are commercial.  There are also academic and three celebrities - George from Washington, Angelina from Los Angeles and Paris from New York. <br>  From Russia - 54 virtual doubles.  You can talk to <a href="http://www.mycybertwin.com/chat/karlsson">my twin</a> .  True, he is still poorly trained.  And in general - I am the best in the world of Carlson :) <br>  PS In six hours after the topic was published, 17 people spoke with my virtual counterpart.  It was very interesting to read all this.  Thanks a lot, everyone. <br>  Write in English, Russian letters do not even appear normally in the recording of the conversation, turn into question marks. <br>  When I began to read conversations with the double, I found a very useful thing - next to each pair there is a ‚ÄúTeach‚Äù link, and if I‚Äôm not happy with how my twin answered the question, I can retrain him immediately.  Thus, you can type a database with real questions and adequate answers to them. <br>  PPS I am recording my conversation with a well-trained (I think the developers themselves) 60-year-old George from Washington. <br><img src="http://www.mycybertwin.com/usermedia/5186.jpg" width="100" height="110" align="left">  You: Hey, George, how are you? <br>  George: Fantastic!  You should try sleeping 12 hours a day too. <br><br>  You: Are you sleeping at the moment? <br>  George: I will get it later <br><br>  You: Who is Condoleezza? <br>  George: Who cares!  I don't mind

      You: What do you do? <br>  George: Now there's a question.  If I can get there, I can get there. <br><br>  You: What do you think about Russia? <br>  George: Our goals remain clear.  Korean Peninshula. <br><br>  You: Do you think Russia is located in Korean Peninsula? <br>  George: Why hurt your head thinking about that? <br><br>  You: What do you think about Putin? <br>  George: If America goes to sleep.  If we blink, they will close their eyes.  So we're not blinking, and we're not going to sleep. <br><br>  You: Why did you say this? <br>  George: Are you American? <br><br>  You: No, I'm Russian. <br>  George: I am the president of the most powerful nation, the USA.  What rock did you crawl out from under? <br><br>  You: And how about domestic animals?  Do you have any? <br>  George: I would like to see you <br><br>  You: And how is your brother? <br>  George: I don‚Äôt know any prior knowledge of it. <br><br>  You: It's very interesting information. <br>  George: is that some kind of lizard? <br><br>  You: Are you a lizard too? <br>  George: I will get it later <br><br>  You: You are repeating yourself. <br>  George: I am repeating myself?  Am I repeating myself? <br><br>  You: Yes, you are. <br>  George: cool.  glad you are so happy <br><br>  You: Yes, it's really cool!  Wishing you the same! <br>  George: That is alright.  but ... you can‚Äôt be faithful.  Remember all the stuff.  You can't be.  And we are blessed.  I‚Äôm sorry for you <br><br>  You: Glad to hear from you, George.  Bye. <br>  George: Bye Karlsson </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8388/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8388/</a></p>
