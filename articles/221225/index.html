      What is your pulse after a 20-minute run? <br>  What is the pulse after going up the escalator in the subway? <br>  How long after the load does the pulse return to normal? <br><br>  What does the Medgadget show when: watch the Doctor House series or Silicon Valley, play Zombies vs. Plants, drink coffee or the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate">Club Mate</a> hacker drink <br><br>  After sleep (1.5, 9, 12 hours) how to find out if I slept well or not (whether the deep and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B1%25D1%258B%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">BDG</a> phases passed) <br><br>  <i>In the photo: after a 10-kilometer run</i> <br><br><br clear="right">  Under the cut there is a little description of the Medgadget and the differences from the previous versions, the analysis of the graphs of the pulse, running, sleep and my subjective conclusions, discoveries and findings. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Short description </h4><br><br>  List of features: <br>  <b>Time and date</b> .  A couple of times used this function.  I am happy - I do not feel hours. <br>  <b>Pedometer</b>  A useful thing.  I used it while running, it is still very interesting to find out how many steps you can ‚Äúfind‚Äù in a day from the computer to the kitchen.  Or how many steps it <i>takes</i> every day to get to the office.  I have 10-15 thousand steps on a working day (without running). <br>  <b>Pulsometer</b> .  He was very useful to me.  I learned a lot about myself.  The average frequency of accessing this function for the first 3 days is 1 time per 15 minutes.  What happens inside of me when this or that outside is happening? <br>  <b>Calorie Counter</b> .  It was curious that the hour of running (10km) = 2 chocolates.  For me, calories are not a problem, on the contrary, where to get them more.  Talent is always hungry.  ‚ÄúStay hungry, stay foolish‚Äù <br>  <b>Sleep tracker</b>  Oh yeah!  What happens there in the head when I sleep?  I had ideas about the phases of sleep, but for the first time I learned about the number of turns over during sleep. <br>  <b>Body temperature</b>  Liked a couple of times. <br>  <b>Moisture skin</b> .  I looked a couple of times at the graphics, did not check it out. <br><br>  View of the clock from the inside <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8e/6c1/b7c/c8e6c1b7c0198b91b3dbebd662374bee.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/735/445/662/73544566243c9acb4873ab40c525f6aa.jpg"><br>  <i>I am trying to catch the green blinking of the sensors, they are cunning, they turn off when they sense that the medgadget is not on the arm.</i> <br><br>  Differences in design - steel elements (clasp and strap fasteners) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7a/5ea/8fd/f7a5ea8fdc55f4be09fca7958e16da23.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Adventure begins </h4>  After I got the watch, I prograstinated for a few days, then I looked at Doctor House (he started running!) And ran himself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/547/0cb/efe/5470cbefeb65b91d2a785826d3f3fff2.jpg"><br>  <i>(House measures the pulse after running "the old fashioned way.")</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ccd/035/978/ccd0359783bab5d249add7ecd3ef586c.jpg" align="right"><br><h4>  Run </h4><br>  ‚ÄúJogging for me is not only training, but also rest.  Every morning this hour belongs <br>  only me when I can be alone with my own thoughts " <i>Bruce Lee</i> <br><br clear="right">  As soon as I put on the medgadget, an interesting feeling of responsibility (or close attention) appeared, because I knew that I would have to write about my experience on Habr√©.  Now I understand why you need a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4">double-blind study</a> .  The program offers to perform 2000 steps to 12-00 every day.  For this gives +25 points.  Naturally I wanted to show off in front of readers - run 10,000! <br><br>  Before that, I always ran ‚Äúintuitively‚Äù / according to sensations, without any plan and feeling.  Now there is an opportunity to find out what is really happening with the heart.  For the first time in my life, I learned that when running, the pulse was 150. Then it was interesting for me to track how long the body regained its normal state. <br><br>  Superman <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c32/9ec/58b/c329ec58b2b46bcb8a0a2638d123a87c.jpg"><br>  In the morning - 10 km cross through the forest, daytime sleep, evening run 2 km.  The heart of the load gave out 81 beats per minute <br><br>  A good day <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c13/a50/ca2/c13a50ca217af1a5f9af2a786f8b344a.jpg"><br>  Getting up at 7 am, 10 km cross, then travel on business.  Characteristic peaks indicate an escalator climb. <br><br>  Normal walking day <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d15/f6d/15a/d15f6d15a32f1b6de772b86a07d42705.jpg"><br>  Remarkably, daytime sleep intervals are Zombies vs. Plants and Dr. House. <br><br>  Vegetable Day <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5e/1b6/62a/e5e1b662a4eeb6ac35c07ef6eac963e5.jpg"><br>  <i>A few steps - and those in the shop for chocolate</i> <br><br><h4>  Gamification </h4><br>  Gamification gave +25 points for 2000 steps to 12 days, but somehow I didn't care, either I ran 10 km or scored, the presence of the medgadget influenced as follows: I ran intuitively and it was approximately 8500-9000 steps, and when you look at sensor - I wanted to press until the round number - 10 000. <br><br>  The very first quest - ‚Äúwear a medgadget for 12 hours without removing‚Äù - you will receive +25 points.  Works!  The first 4 days, then my motivation to wear medgadzhet, not removing, was not glasses, but interest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b14/f3a/608/b14f3a6084208d71b7bf7922b8bf75b8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f9c/583/073/f9c583073a80b011219cd2324bc52109.jpg"><br><br>  Implemented game mechanics "accessibility": until you have scored a certain number of points on the proposed quests - you can not take new quests. <br><br>  Personally, I didn‚Äôt inspire the points set by the computer program, and therefore I didn‚Äôt want to get the lefts and perform the suggested quests alone.  But during the first run through the forest, I myself invented a quest (the goal should be big and inspiring) - to <b>meet an elk</b> .  Immediately it became more fun.  First, he began to run deeper and deeper into the forest and in different directions, he often began to look from under his feet in front of himself to distant sites - he looked for an elk.  Plus, there was excitement, if I did the quest - an excellent reason to boast to my friends. <br>  Quest is in progress. <br><br>  The following also helped me - I did not have breakfast until I ran, the hunter archetype turned on - ‚ÄúI ran well = I ate well‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Sleep </h4><br><br>  "Who knows the secret of sleep - knows the secret of the brain" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Jouvet">Michel Jouvet</a> <br><br>  Recently, the alternation mode of sleep and wakefulness has become chaotic in me. <br>  One of the goals of using medgadzhet was "the transition to the human sleep mode from the vampire mode."  What partially managed. <br>  The very cool result of familiarizing myself with how I slept was two things: <br>  1) the understanding that the duration of sleep is not the most important indicator (slept 12 hours, and slept ‚Äúworse‚Äù than when slept 6) <br>  2) I don‚Äôt know what is happening in the brain when ‚Äúhe‚Äù sees a graph of how ‚Äúhe‚Äù slept, but now I have a strong feeling that ‚Äúhe‚Äù is trying to wake up, ‚Äúgetting into a rhythm‚Äù. <br><br>  Hour and a half sleep rhythm <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81a/a2c/361/81aa2c361c19e402aff81408dc3eb820.jpg"><br>  <i>(I decided to sleep in the evening - it turned out to be perfect sleep, the program put 20% of the daily sleep rate, and slept for 90 minutes)</i> <br><br>  Good dream <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bb/5d8/4c7/6bb5d84c7aed62b579c3974401fde794.jpg"><br>  <i>The program has delivered 92%</i> <br><br>  Horrible dream <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/486/ba1/2cb/486ba12cb2ec29419061e6f7ec687e20.jpg"><br>  <i>Got sick</i>  <i>For 12 hours I got 36%.</i>  <i>Erzal in a dream 80 times.</i>  <i>I woke up angry and frustrated.</i>  <i>What did 4 more minutes - ¬´Unknown¬ª</i> <br><br>  We are waiting for a portable and convenient EEG to explore the dream and the brain. <br><br><h4>  Patterns </h4><br>  As a true Castanedo warrior, I have no special patterns! <br><br>  Honestly, I do not know what conclusions can be drawn from this information, but let it be under the spoiler <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Patterns</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Calories <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/510/57d/4bb/51057d4bb1bcbf6d1c2fa6456691d15b.jpg"><br><br>  Pulse <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/788/7e4/b32/7887e4b32b4146882bbcde15526006e9.jpg"><br><br>  Sweating <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/329/350/9e3/3293509e3eefcc27ac25b1ea207cb4e0.jpg"><br><br>  Skin surface temperature <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/052/cde/b31/052cdeb3139ff3e715b820c2080b9da5.jpg"><br><br>  Steps <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/542/d21/404/542d2140407542a810e3ce526d31927c.jpg"><br><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Aesthetics </h4><br><br>  Dawn <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1c/5a1/ebe/f1c5a1ebe76744ab10255146f77f742f.jpg"><br>  How great it is to run at dawn, in the dew, along the sandy shore of the pond, see the squirrels, run in the rain when the bird cherry blossoms, run through the blooming apple orchard. <br>  Beauty. <br><br><h4>  Observations: </h4><br>  - at the sight of a girl you begin to try to run better (faster, the movements are more collected, the posture changes). <br>  - I want to run not on asphalt, but on the side of the road (on dew, on withered foliage, on sand on the bank of a pond, on a marsh with nettle) <br>  - sometimes the neck and shoulders ‚Äúnumb‚Äù, hands ‚Äî what kind of warm-up should be done ‚Äúon the go‚Äù? <br>  - on the day when I ran, on a ten-point scale of subjective happiness +2 <br>  - the strength of the gestalt: if you run 8,500 steps, for the sake of a round figure, you want to ‚Äúfinish‚Äù up to 10,000 <br>  - there was a feeling that I began to sleep "getting into a rhythm" <br>  - pulse when going up on the escalator in the metro 110-120 <br>  - when playing ‚ÄúZombies against plants‚Äù (passing the last three stages), the device showed that I was sleeping.  Just like when watching the TV series "Doctor House", but when watching the TV series "Silicon Valley" - it showed that I was hearty. <br>  - neither coffee (1 cup), nor Club Mate (1 bottle), did not affect the testimony of the Medgadget, so I stopped my quest for experiments with substances <br><br><h4>  Findings: </h4><br>  If you have the opportunity to learn something new about yourself (how the heart or sleep tracking works) - use it, it's worth it. <br><br>  + watches are useful when running, even very <br>  + new dimension of knowledge about yourself <br>  + changed perception: pulse and sleep <br>  + good battery, manages to charge while uploading data to the Internet <br>  + very convenient data presentation, cool custom graphics <br><br>  - from the <b><a href="http://www.gamification.co/2012/01/19/getting-three-fs-in-gamification/">FFF</a></b> gamification scheme (feedback, friends, fun), only feedback is present, the rest must be ‚Äúcompleted by yourself‚Äù <br>  - after a couple of days, the left hand was "tired" (moved the clock to the right hand) <br>  - (a bit of conspiracy theory), and what else does the clock measure, what do we not know about? <br><br><h4>  P.S. </h4><br>  One day, after I ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù, burning with curiosity, I went to find out how I slept there, and what was my surprise when the following inscription appeared on the monitor: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5d/6f3/fa1/d5d6f3fa12778619ff9daa832da8f78d.jpg"><br>  <i>‚ÄúStill sleep?</i>  <i>We must be sure that you are completely awake ...
