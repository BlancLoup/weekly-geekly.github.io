More precisely, this time only about one of them, which fell to all the soul.  This is a Thule Paramount TFDP-115, a backpack that is optimized for the city and short trips (no matter where you are going, on a trip or a hike).  The volume of a backpack is 29 liters.  Is it a lot or a little?  By experience, just right - if it is more, then it is difficult to call such a backpack a city one.  If less, then the campaign is not particularly selected. <br><br>  Like any Thule backpack, the Paramount TFDP-115 is stitched well.  It has compartments for equipment and ordinary things.  "Technical" pockets are protected from external influences, which are especially relevant in the subway or train.  It is unlikely that someone will like to come home, to see on his tablet a dent from the elbow of a neighbor on the car, right?  Well, here such a scenario is excluded.  These are not just words - a couple of our employees bought such backpacks for themselves and carry them both into a tail and into a mane, as they say.  There are no problems with the safety of things from the word ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/622/9a2/4a3/6229a24a30f741b297530c528e2d8aac.jpg">

      Our employees use Thule Paramount TFDP-115, mainly in the city.  Also tested backpack on business trips and not too long forays into nature.  In the latter case, the waterproofness of the backpack, which coped with the May rains and even snow, was particularly useful.  In the light of recent cold spells, Thule Paramount TFDP-115 can also be useful - its volume is enough to cram a small, but very warm plaedik :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/efd/bdc/e46/efdbdce4611142d48ad1f2fffbbe2a7c.jpg"><br><br>  What is it about this backpack that you can talk about in more detail?  First of all, it contains a lot of things.  And if you correctly distribute everything in the volume of the backpack, it will fit in more than you can imagine.  Moreover, if you don‚Äôt just spread everything on pockets and compartments, you can distribute them competently (remember, right?), And you can quickly find any item. <br><br>  The backpack is waterproof, covered with nylon.  For additional protection there is another layer of waterproof material from below, so even if it happens that the backpack falls into a puddle (anything can happen), it won't get wet, everything will remain intact and preserved.  And most importantly - clean and dry (wet tablet or laptop - the last thing I would like to get after the rain). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/540/170/d65/540170d65eb042ebb3f6186d33840539.jpg"><br><br>  Problems with the availability of offices does not arise.  If you have time, you can open the backpack completely, if there is no opportunity to open the backpack (subway), then there is an opportunity to climb into the side of the Thule Paramount.  A backpack without problems and discomfort can be put on one shoulder - if you prefer this option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b5f/019/abb/b5f019abb520497f8a06e2c88087f826.jpg"><br><br>  Especially convenient, as mentioned above, can be called a branch for technology.  Place for the tablet, for example, is reinforced with additional soft tabs, especially from the bottom and along the edges.  A lot of space in the compartment for other things - clothes without any problems or something else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/703/7cb/2f0/7037cb2f0b2946808f58524e941a7b3f.jpg"><br><br>  Another compartment is the hood that closes with a zipper.  Here it is worthwhile to place things to which you need to organize the most prompt access.  In addition, there is a pocket for fragile things like sunglasses and phones, it is equipped with additional protection from external influences.  In general, everything is in its place, the designers of the backpack took good care of ergonomics and the distribution of free space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/685/220/b62/685220b6237a4f69982a0739f45e882f.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Comfort and convenience </h3><br>  In an effort to optimize the backpack, its creators have not forgotten about convenience.  His back is soft, there is a special "pillow".  At the same time, the ventilation is also high, the back will not sweat (well, the truth is, if it is + 35-40 on the street, then no air permeability of the fabric will help).  The straps are also soft, so even a backpack with a heavy load will not cut the shoulders.  The length of the straps is adjustable, there is nothing unusual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3b4/f4d/39f/3b4f4d39f2294a1184bead7c5a0e9012.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cc5/70a/357/cc570a35789b425c9d4a7b49659511af.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/52a/644/7cc/52a6447cc56741ee8b8ca121fe554e3f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7ca/615/8f5/7ca6158f53504092bfbf18388ead3ddf.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Specifications </h3><br><ul><li>  Material: nylon; </li><li>  Black colour; </li><li>  Capacity: 29 liters; </li><li>  External dimensions: 51.1 √ó 31 √ó 26.9 cm; </li><li>  Internal dimensions: 36.4 √ó 24.9 √ó 2.4 cm; </li><li>  Weight: 1.08 kg; </li><li>  Manufacturer's warranty: 2 years; </li><li>  Manufacturing country: Sweden. </li></ul><br><h3>  General conclusion </h3><br>  It is difficult to find unsuccessful options among Thule backpacks, there are much more positive examples.
