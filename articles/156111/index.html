  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Basic cognitive psychotechnics: imagination, concentration, comparison, name</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Reflecting on cognitive education, I came to the inevitable conclusion that cognitive skills can (and should) also be developed, as well as to pump muscles.  Better since childhood and life. <br>  How do we think?  What is the difference between human thinking and a cat?  How does the knowledge process work?  What are the cognitive skills?  As I did not try, but it turns out that the basis of the whole variety of methods of cognition is only <strike>three</strike> four basic ways of thinking (let's call this basic cognitive psychotechnics, basic cognitive skills).  Apparently, this is the minimum necessary set, since the absence of any of these psychotechniques leads to inability to perform a number of cognitive operations, and, conversely, bias, hypertrophy of any of them leads to mental disorders.  So, in the studio: <br><ol><li>  Comparison (comparison) </li><li>  Concentration, concentration, - these skills are both in man and in our smaller brothers.  Even birds possess comparison skills, and in concentration a boa has no equal ... </li><li>  Imagination (fantasy) - this is a skill that almost never occurs in animals.  Even very ‚Äútalented‚Äù higher mammals (dogs, cats) and primates can imagine their subsequent actions. </li><li>  The name - and this is the ability <s>to give clicks</s> to assign designations - seems to be the skill that truly distinguishes homo sapience sapience then animals.  The name, designation is far from simple and means a transition to an abstraction of the object, denoting its concept (nomen).  This transition into the next signal system, it gives the opportunity to operate with sets of abstract concepts - texts, and this is no longer a cat, and even a monkey (and many human beings, cho ...) will not be mastered. </li></ol><br>  It is important that memory operations (memorization and recall) - I propose not to refer to cognitive functions, since the information does not acquire new properties.  Even insects can remember and remember. <br>  Nocomments, I think everything is clear.  Consider how the main cognitive skills are displayed in these coordinates. <br><ul><li>  <strong>Search</strong> - sorting and comparison of the desired pattern-pattern with those stored in memory. </li><li>  <strong>Decomposition is a</strong> search in an object (system) of known components (subsystems) and their selection (focusing on them). </li><li>  <strong>Combination -</strong> sorting and holding in memory of several memories (objects, components, etc.) and imagination of them together. </li><li>  <strong>Synthesis</strong> : a combination of objects, the imagination of the final result, comparison with the final result, recombination (several iterations), then focusing on the variant that is closest to the final result. </li><li>  <strong>Analysis</strong> : imagination, decomposition of objects, then - comparison, (comparison of properties of objects). </li><li>  <strong>Deduction</strong> (from general to specific) - analysis, selection of a general property, synthesis of the result with this property. </li><li>  <strong>Reduction</strong> (reduction): analysis, selection of "unimportant" properties, synthesis of the result without these properties. </li><li>  <strong>Induction</strong> (from the particular to the general): analysis, comparison of properties, focusing on common properties, synthesis of the result with a common property. </li><li>  <strong>Abduction</strong> : analysis, comparison of properties, synthesis of the result with a given property ,. </li></ul><br><br>  And more complex skills: <br><ul><li>  <strong>Design</strong> (planning): synthesis + deduction (imagination (goal setting), concentration (goal selection), imagination (work decomposition), comparison (execution methods), focus on the selected steps), </li><li>  <strong>Reflection</strong> : focusing on experience, imagination of an ideal result, comparison with experience, transition to design improvement. </li></ul><br><br>  <strong>That is why cognitive education will be ten times more effective than the existing one: the student does not need to teach dozens of subjects, but it is enough to hone these 3 (THREE) basic cognitive skills and teach them to use!</strong>  <strong>ONE HE WILL DISCUSS YOURSELF!</strong> <br>  It is interesting to see from these coordinates the most famous mental illnesses. <br><ul><li>  Brad: uncontrollable imagination)). </li><li>  Schizophrenia, multiple personality: imagination and comparison without concentration. </li><li>  Manic, autism: hyperactivity. </li><li>  Paranoia: imagination and concentration without comparison. </li></ul><br>  As a result, the following issues emerged for further research: <br>  1. What exercises are best for developing imagination, concentration and comparison in children and adults? <br>  2. Is it possible to treat mental deviants, ‚Äúpumping over‚Äù the missing psychotechnics? <br>  3. Are there really three psychotechniques?  What else can be? <br>  4. Is it possible transpersonalization, group use of these psychotechnics? <br>  5. Is it possible to automate the process and teach the AI ‚Äã‚Äãthese basic skills? <br></div>
