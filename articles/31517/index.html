It was still in those times when <br>  there were no google campuses, the apple apple was still overflowing with many colors, and the sun and <br>  SGI was still considered a super machine. <br><br>  At that time, for many geeks and nerds, ArsDigita was about the same beacon, <br>  what is now google.  Many have grown up on the book by Philip Greenspun <br>  <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/">Philip and Alex 'Guide to Web Publishing</a> and His Short Works <br>  <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/">SQL for Web Nerds</a> and <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/tcl/">Tcl for Web Nerds</a> .  For many, the <a href="http://www.photo.net/making-photographs/">hobby of the photo was</a> the same <br>  <a href="http://www.photo.net/samantha/">inspired by Phil</a> . <br><br>  ACS (ArsDigita Community System) was the first open implementation platform for <br>  building sites, whether it is CRM, portal, CMS ‚Äî in general, any application, <br>  community oriented.  The choice of architecture for implementation <br>  This platform may seem strange in part (especially for the Russian <br>  reader) ‚ÄîACS was written in <a href="http://tcl.tk/">Tcl</a> , and used <a href="http://www.aolserver.com/">AOLServer</a> as <br>  web server.  However, if you read the articles above, you may <br>  understand why.

      For those who are interested, ACS still lives mostly like <a href="http://openacs.org/">OpenACS</a> , completely <br>  migrated to postgreSQL instead of oracle (although oracle is still <br>  supported).  All assets of ArsDigita were <a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/presscenter/2002/FAQ_ArsDigita.html">bought in 2002 by Red Hat</a> , but on <br>  right now, what was supposed to be Red Hat Contacts and Content Management <br>  System (CCM) no longer exists. <br><br>  This translation is dedicated to the history of this company, its formation and its death (part <br>  first of three). <br><br>  *** <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If you happen to be near the Delaware court in the last few <br>  days, then you may have heard about the lawsuit of venture capitalists-investors with <br>  founders of ArsDigita.  This letter I want to explain the current <br>  situation (from the point of view of one of the parties to the defense). <br><br>  99% of the information below has nothing to do with judicial <br>  process.  A lawsuit filed by shareholders of the company is trying to determine the rights and <br>  the degree of control over the management of the company on the basis of legal norms and signed <br>  agreements.  In other words, inferences about who the person knows how to <br>  manage the company and were all the decisions made correct going beyond <br>  current process. <br><br><h3>  Start </h3><br><br>  In the yard in 1993.  At about this time, the basics of the knowledge that <br>  later formed the basis of the ArsDigita Community System (the online construction system <br>  communities).  Most people who make money from software development <br>  they did it because they were the first to find a solution <br>  Problems.  Attempt to create a company on the bare enthusiasm "our programmers are better <br>  Microsoft and Oracle programmers are doomed to fail ‚Äî both companies <br>  they have in their arsenals sufficiently high-class specialists capable of <br>  bury any competition.  But you can count on success if you <br>  build it on the idea ‚Äúwe will solve this problem several years earlier than <br>  Microsoft and Oracle. ‚Äù <br><br>  A good example that a small company can live and thrive, despite <br>  on the strongest competition from large companies is Adobe.  Read <br>  biographies of its founders: <br>  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/executivebios/johnwarnock.html">http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/executivebios/johnwarnock.html</a> and <br>  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/executivebios/charlesgeschke.html">http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/executivebios/charlesgeschke.html</a> .  You <br>  You‚Äôll see that these two guys who founded Adobe have been working hard for many years (and at Xerox PARC, <br>  both in Evans and Sutherland) over the very subject areas for which <br>  Adobe now offers turnkey solutions. <br><br>  Adobe‚Äôs engineers and founders aren‚Äôt smarter than their Microsoft counterparts, they‚Äôre just <br>  began to think about graphics and printing earlier than Microsoft. <br><br>  Fast forward to the year 1998 th.  We have contracts with several large ones. <br>  companies (America On-Line, Hewlett-Packard, Levi Strauss, Oracle. We <br>  known as ideological leaders (see Macmillan‚Äôs Macmillan article in Database <br>  Backed Web Sites) and as market leaders (our open source software for building <br>  learning communities).  In the words of Jack Welch, CEO <br>  GE, working for company # 1 or # 2 is both easier and more fun.  Other things being equal, customers <br>  knock on your door, not the other way around. <br><br>  A year later, in 1999, customers simply pushed through our door.  Good example <br>  is Siemens.  They had to solve an extremely important task, for which <br>  ArsDigita Community System fit perfectly.  Understanding how task and <br>  the solution fit together, the Boston Consulting Group brought them to our <br>  Old Quarter Headquarters on Franklin Street, 603 and two weeks later the contract was <br>  signed by <br><br>  We grew up.  But we were still a small company and tried to avoid direct <br>  confrontation with competitors that were financed much better <br>  us.  They built "closed" decisions while we preached <br>  openness  We wanted to replay them by creating a global application using <br>  open standards and full access to our code, instead of defeating them <br>  on the pages of Business 2.0 magazine.  We laughed at most of the little ones. <br>  companies building closed solutions, we asked, ‚ÄúWhat is their marketing <br>  strategy?  Are we both Microsoft and Oracle, just not market leaders and out of money?  So what, <br>  does it help to search for and learn from the best programmers? ‚Äù <br><br>  By March 2000, we had grown to 80 people.  I was still General, but <br>  was beginning to worry that I was not able to answer anymore who in the company <br>  worked on each specific task.  But we still earn good money. <br>  profit, monthly revenue year on year was $ 20 million in <br>  year.  We paid almost $ 1 million in income taxes for the year 1999.  Not bad at all <br>  Considering that we started the investment of only $ 10,000. <br><br>  We never tried to attract venture financing, but our momentum and <br>  profits did it for us.  Many of the best East Coast venture capital firms <br>  wanted to invest in us, not least because of the super active <br>  investment climate of the time, they sought to invest in a company <br>  and how and where to make a profit ‚Äî this can be found out later.  Arsdigita <br>  looked much better than most start-ups.  Despite our 1000% growth in <br>  year, we had our own reserves in the accounts.  Most of our revenue was <br>  constant, and most of our customers were pleased with us and loyal to us. <br><br>  Usually, large companies do not like to buy corporate-level software from small <br>  developers.  The risk of bankruptcy is too high.  Using open software <br>  source code, in a sense, neutralizes this risk a bit, but desire and <br>  The tendency to order from IBM, Microsoft or Oracle is strong.  We tried our best <br>  demonstrate their financial stability and strength.  We bought a Ferrari, <br>  which was provided to anyone who brings 10 friends to the company.  In the reality <br>  the car cost us only $ 2,000 a month;  the employee to whom she was given <br>  I could use it only on condition that he continued working with us.  well and <br>  Ferrari's cost is significantly lower than how much head hunter‚Äôs services cost. <br>  in terms of the ten employees hired.  The presence of such a car on navay <br>  parking created a sense of extravagance ‚Äî despite the fact that we were in the office <br>  fairly modest, even economical life.  And it could hardly be otherwise if <br>  we paid $ 50-85,000 base, plus an annual premium based on the results <br>  companies and the employee himself, and paid for the work of professional <br>  developers at MIT.  We had a couple more tricks similar to <br>  Ferrari.  One ‚Äî oceanfront home in Cape Cod, where the development team is <br>  could leave work.  Another ‚Äî ArsDigita University, free annual <br>  professional training program for software developers.  Although it can all <br>  look like unnecessary, causing excesses, but in fact a similar approach <br>  to people constantly reminded of the human attitude and care, gave reasons for <br>  journalists writing about us (and they wrote), while standing no more than our <br>  1999 net income (i.e., almost nothing, provided that our revenue <br>  continued to grow). <br><br>  At the end of March 2000, we signed financing from two venture funds: <br>  Greylock and General Atlantic.  With the arrival of two checks from the funds in our bank <br>  formed a solid amount of $ 38 million.  Having this stock, we decided to invest part <br>  into the perspective development of our product and into marketing.  Under the heading "development <br>  product ‚Äùthe idea was that partial financing of development was done <br>  teams involved in client projects.  The idea was that if the request <br>  client on one or another functional more or less coincided with the fact that we wanted <br>  add to ACS, then we were ready to significantly reduce the price, thereby giving ourselves <br>  the opportunity to study the problem more thoroughly and write the code so that it <br>  could be used on other projects, thereby improving ACS.  Under <br>  marketing rubric was the further expansion of our educational <br>  activities (a kind of "educational marketing").  Well, of course, we need <br>  was working capital.  A company earning $ 20 million per year should have a good order. <br>  $ 10 million in the bank, in case any of the clients does not pay, will descend <br>  economic downturn, a large and important project will take longer than <br>  planned, etc.  Due to the fact that until that time we grew by 1000% per year, <br>  we never had more than a couple of millions in bills. <br><br>  Under the terms of venture financing, VI (venture investors, <br>  <em>approx.</em>  <em>translator</em> ) bought shares of the company, which gave them about 30% <br>  votes.  According to the standard conditions of corporate governance minority <br>  shareholders of this level should have received very little (or no) <br>  strategic control over the company.  In this regard, we also had <br>  signed an agreement between shareholders, according to which current shareholders (I and Jin <br>  Choi (Jin Choi)) vote for the board of directors of the company in the following composition: <br><br><ul><li>  1 representative from Greylock </li><li>  1 representative from General Atlantic </li><li>  3 senior managers from ArsDigita, including the CEO </li><li>  2 invitees </li></ul><br><br>  Those.  VI received 2 of 7 seats on the board of directors.  Current shareholders will have to <br>  elect the rest.  In addition, VIs have received veto power over certain types <br>  significant transactions, n.  buying expensive equipment, selling a company, <br>  acquisition of another company.  Finally, in the case of the sale of the company, they had <br>  eligible to receive on a priority basis the amount of their investments of $ 38 million (which <br>  Needless to say, when sold for less than $ 38 million, the remaining shareholders <br>  would not get anything).  The terms offered to us by three other VI firms were <br>  are equivalent.  They wanted a ‚Äúseat on the council,‚Äù but nobody wanted <br>  absolute control over the company.  Their proposals boiled down to <br>  help the founders of ArsDigita do what they have already done very well. <br><br>  In parallel with the venture financing negotiations, we conducted an active search <br>  "External CEO".  Now, after I talked to many people <br>  succeeding, I understand that it was a fundamentally bad idea.  Even <br>  The most capable person will need a couple of years to understand the culture <br>  the company, its people, the market, objectives and goals.  Attracted by the CEO can be <br>  very lucky in a stable 50 year old company in which its bureaucratic <br>  the system itself is also the one in charge (see George W. Bush at the head of the Federal <br>  Government (meaning the current daddy (spring 2008) of the US President, <br>  George Bush Sr., <em>approx.</em>  <em>translator</em> )).  But in a young company so internal <br>  There is no stability and strength. <br><br>  Anyway, we hired Allen Shaheen to recommend Chip <br>  Hazard (Chip Hazard), an employee of Greylock, who represented the interests of the company in <br>  our board of directors.  Allen‚Äôs previous job was Cambridge <br>  Technology Partners (CTP), which was involved in the precompilation of IT services.  In her <br>  He managed a large group of consultants in the overseas branch of the company.  I knew, <br>  that Allen has no experience in software development and that when working in CTP in his <br>  the tasks included neither the development of a general development strategy of the company, nor the need <br>  extraordinary, innovative approach to solving problems.  In other words, he <br>  always worked for someone in a significantly less competitive environment than an area <br>  software development.  However, the other candidates we interviewed were either <br>  very poorly prepared (as one of the Lotus company), or were too <br>  aggressive and intrusive and my management team of the time would not have been able <br>  work with them.  Allen seemed like a man who could work together with <br>  complex people scattered around different offices of the company, thanks to his experience <br>  management of a multinational business in the provision of IT services.  Generally, <br>  We agreed that I will continue to deal with engineering issues <br>  education and propaganda while Allen will do everything <br>  the rest. <br><br>  A few weeks after Allen‚Äôs passage, several people pointed out to me <br>  the fact that I have almost no power left: Allen and two representatives <br>  VI could block any decision on the board of directors.  Considering that we are so <br>  did not fill the two invited positions on the council, there were many <br>  the truth.  3 of 5 = absolute power.  And the point. <br><br>  Part two <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/translations/41274.html">has already been published</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31517/</a></p>
