  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Agiledays in St. Petersburg, September 17, 2010</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><img src="http://spb.agiledays.ru/img/logo.png" alt="image"></a> <br>  There are as many conversations about Agile as there are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref%3Dnb_sb_noss%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Dstripbooks%26field-keywords%3Dagile%26x%3D0%26y%3D0">books</a> , but the question of how to make development flexible and effective in a particular company gives rise to a lot of discussions.  As practice shows and previous posts on Habr√© about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pm/96999/">Agiledays</a> and meetings of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/scrumtrek/blog/87992/">the Agilerussia community</a> , interest in this topic does not fade.  That is why we continue to do conferences related to the organization of development processes. <br><br>  You can congratulate the residents of the northern capital - Agiledays reached their <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/">city</a> . <br><br>  I think advertising Agiledays does not make sense.  I can only say that this is the third time in the last year when we get together ( <a href="http://agiledays.ru/">Moscow</a> , <a href="http://ekt.agiledays.ru/">Yekaterinburg</a> ) to discuss modern software development management approaches.
