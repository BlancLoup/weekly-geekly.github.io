I thought for a long time, but I couldn‚Äôt decide to take a Chinese phone, even if it makes players from the company and sells them on the world market under the Meizu-Ritmix brand.  So, having studied the forums and identifying the pros and cons, I decided to purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f9/f8/f9f8b467bc238ba3826cc2a07fc70bca.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

      Purchased produced from one person engaged in the implementation of the M8 in Moscow (from hand to hand), as well as in the regions (through the EMC). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a3/8d/a38d630727cd7ab89453b13ec0b92c7b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Opening the box you will find: the device itself, a battery, a lid, a standard droplet type headset with overlays for them, a CD with drivers, a USB-cord (part-time charging), a USB-to-AC adapter (the outlet is worth noting a Chinese one), also There may be an adapter from the Chinese to our outlet, and Russian instructions (when buying from Russian sellers). <br><br>  <b>Officially stated specifications:</b> <br>  <b>Processor</b> - Samsung S3C6410 ARM11, 677 MHz (in the nomenal only 533 MHz) <br>  <b>ROM</b> - 256 MB <br>  <b>Built-in memory</b> - 8 GB (or 16 GB) <br>  <b>Display</b> - 720 √ó 480, 16 million colors, 3.4 "(in fact, color is limited to 262k) <br>  <b>Communication standards</b> - GSM 850/900/1800/1900, EDGE <br>  <b>Interfaces</b> - Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR, Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g, USB <br>  <b>Battery</b> - Li-Ion 1200 mAh (in newer devices 1300 mAh) <br>  <b>Camera</b> - 3.2 MP with AF <br>  <b>Operating system</b> - MyMoblie based on Windows CE 6.0R3 <br>  <b>Sensors</b> - G-sensor, light sensor, infrared <br>  <b>Dimensions</b> - 108 mm (D) √ó 59 mm (W) √ó 12 mm (T) <br>  <b>Weight</b> - 118 g (with battery) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/76/30/7630a4f45824247d55a62280ce77e9af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The price in the Chinese market is 1780 yuan (~ 8t.r) for the 8GB version and 2080 yuan (~ 9.5t.r) for the 16GB version, there are both black and white devices.  The price on the Russian market starts from ~ 12500r for 8GB and ~ 14500r for 16GB.  Also in March of this year, a PCT certificate was obtained for the official sale of the second-generation Meizu M8 on the Russian market since the summer of 2010.  Prices of certified devices are 13000 and 15000 for 8 and 16 GB versions, respectively. <br><br>  Now let's talk about the device itself. <br><br>  Externally - an almost complete copy of the iPhone, not counting the subtle changes.  The assembly raises no objections, the gaps are even, no squeaks, everything is at the level of world brands (and sometimes even higher).  The main disadvantage of the glossy case is its margins, this is especially noticeable on the black device.  The bezel around the screen is made of anodized aluminum, which makes it quite durable in case of impact.  The durability of the case at a high level, for several months of use on my device only rubbed the gloss on the corners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d9/d8/d9d8fa88763216435e263eb1292634b1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/60/b6/60b68722c2ccc6f80c2066f091c91d2a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Perhaps some of the readers have already read reviews of this device, but over time they have lost all relevance, the shell has been completely rewritten for the firmware, and also due to the forthcoming entry into the Russian market, the Chinese, in collaboration with the developers from the Russian community, make various fixes for entering the device on the Russian market. <br><br>  Having installed the current firmware with add-ons (0.9.9.1 dated May 16, 2010) on the device and turning it on in front of us, the desktop will appear: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/79/1b/791b0401dbcf897bd0cc4d618adbbeba.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5b/07/5b0781bb72cd5badd7aad74c80c7cf15.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, the similarity with the iPhone is striking, with the exception of details.  The number of pages of the desktop is limited to the 16th.  Glide smooth, no complaints.  The screen of the device is very bright and perfectly viewed from large angles.  Touchscreen capacitive from the same manufacturer as the iPhone.  In the last devices tachi are made using some kind of PET technology. <br><br>  Russification is completely made by the Russian community, in Russian firmware there is a change between Russian and English, only Chinese and English are available in the base firmware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/01/a7/01a78fa74743618d903f6ff153d09424.png" alt="image"><br><br>  All standard software is written on Meizu's own SDK, compatibility with Windows software is rather weak, but still present.  The multimedia capabilities of the device deserve praise, even with a processor speed reduced to 533 MHz, the device perfectly digests 700MB rips without any tricks, in case the native player does not have the necessary codecs, Core Player written for WM comes to the rescue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/72/db/72db356fe60e08e0631ce1b6deb1d815.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I would call the Meizu audio player the best one I‚Äôve seen on Windows systems.  Functionality and sound - at a height, the interface is intuitive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/32/27/32275211e7edaddbec1b59a220ebbcf9.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f2/57/f25744435511f76738554d5b5cc464b9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Also, it shows the status and control of the player on a locked screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2a/35/2a3525c9e79690ad6989294f526a2fbf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Do not forget about beauty in Meizu, the player has a very beautiful visualization: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/76/15/76159de145da9626774e5dccd823a480.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the settings of the player, they even considered such a trifle as the ability to boost / cancel high or low frequencies, without using an equalizer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f9/79/f979f3284e8b6193665c95249f1fb21d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When developing a new interface, Meizu engineers decided to make a system of widgets on the desktop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b8/11/b811f25eb18c845945fb8f580ff3e0e9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The standard phone browser is Opera 9.5: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b0/08/b0087875a76e6fdd3d281f0460f6f740.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/44/16/4416f369ffce50a50ccf7fff6201f463.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There is support for horizontal mode and multitouch functions.  The basic firmware also has a download manager.  Also among the native software, you can find an email client, IM clients for QQ and MSN protocols, a weather application with a widget for the desktop (initially the weather is available only for China, but there is a patch for Russian cities). <br><br>  With the emergence of a new interface, Meizu decided to make its own software store called MyStore, everything would be fine, but for owners outside of China, this became a problem, because you can only buy software as a citizen of China, of course, there is free software, but there are some problems too , for the most part, this software is only in Chinese. <br><br>  I won‚Äôt say a lot about the battery, but with active use I have enough for a day, and the manufacturer claims 6 hours of talk time, 7 hours of continuous video viewing, almost a day of listening to music. <br><br>  To heap - a couple of videos with our sabzhevym device: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gnQikmjLSg&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjZlOYLUVepn9imi09YFS_NQnb2xg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8S-H2MiaDqk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjR3ns7gorb9rrAuoWppeLqNvCnNg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Despite its origin, Meizu does not repeat the fate of all its fellows, the device turned out really unique, with its own twist.  Many of the shortcomings for owners outside of China have been eliminated, although the Chinese have not yet released the final firmware with an index of 1.0.  Jack Wong (head of Meizu) also announced support for Android 2.1 for the Meizu M8 before the appearance of the Meizu M9, the approximate release of which is scheduled for autumn 2010, the device will support the 3G standard and have 2 OS - MyMobile and Android. <br><br>  <i>Please note that the author of the topic is not me, but <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/hieros/" class="user_link">hieros</a> , which at the time of publication of the review did not yet have an account on Habr√©, therefore, it‚Äôs not necessary to send pluses to me :)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94029/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94029/</a></p>
