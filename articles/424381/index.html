Gambling covers the whole world.  Over the past few years, the gaming industry has become one of the fastest growing.  In a world where everyone is obsessed with games, age and gender do not matter.  With the development of technology, online multiplayer games have become an alternative to expensive game consoles.  The popularity of online games with several participants (Massive Multiplayer Online, MMO) has grown dramatically due to advances in broadband access technologies, the improvement of hardware and the algorithms of the games themselves. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/424381/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yj/tr/kk/yjtrkkwa4pnapyvdb5icp-x5etm.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  It seems that all you need is a computer and an internet connection.  But in fact, it all depends on the hosting of the game server in a professional data center.  And choosing the <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/314024/">right platform</a> with the right resources, a reliable <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/341228/">hosting service provider</a> is crucial for those who decide to create their own gaming website for leisure or earnings. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ab/2e6/fe2/5ab2e6fe2ce06919348fccbf5b353f76.jpg"></div><br>  Professional data center hosting provider offers a modern infrastructure.

      &lt;img align = "center" src = VPS - the best solution for the game server? <br>  To deploy a gaming site, you can use a VPS or a dedicated server.  VPS <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/307494/">virtual servers are</a> relatively inexpensive and offer the latest technology tools, which means you will have adequate resources at an affordable price. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eba/2d1/add/eba2d1adde523862c81d659c14a22358.jpg"></div><br>  Among the advantages of using a <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub/game_server">VPS to host a game server</a> are the following: <br><br><ul><li>  Most VPS servers have a static IP address, and this is an important requirement for a multiplayer gaming server. </li><li>  Full administrative access to install and manage the game server via remote desktop.  Setting up a game server using <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/358630/">RDP</a> is similar to installing a game server on your local computer. </li><li>  VPS servers are easily accessible, and you can easily update server files as they change on your local machine. </li><li>  You can install a proxy server for the game server. </li></ul><br>  As a rule, VPS are offered with full administrative access through remote desktop (on Windows VPS) and SSH (on Linux VPS).  You can install and run your gaming software on a virtual server.  But in some cases, you may need a dedicated (dedicated), rather than a virtual server. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44e/298/d92/44e298d92278ec19e36e5899cdcfd6b9.jpg"></div><br>  On the Internet you can find a lot of discussions about whether the VPS is suitable for games.  Some believe that it is not for everyone, especially when it comes to demanding games with good graphics.  And even in the basic package, the hosting company must provide for this purpose at least 1 GB of RAM, 1 processor, 5 TB of traffic, 25 GB of SSD-storage and 1 Gigabit port. <br><br>  The hosting provider must also ensure minimum network latency, perform proactive monitoring and comprehensive daily backups.  Some users strongly recommend using a dedicated server for games, reporting that, according to their experience, VPS is not suitable for a gaming platform. <br><br>  Others, on the contrary, believe that VPS is a good solution, especially considering the budget.  If you only need one game server, then VPS will do.  Technically, VPS allows you to host gaming sites on it, but it all depends on how many resources are required.  Since this is a gaming site, the number of visitors may increase significantly over time, and more resources will be needed.  Therefore, a dedicated server will be the best option. <br><br>  How to choose the "right" hosting for the game server?  Many games impose rather high requirements on the server, and with remote hosting of players, the latency indicators (latency) can vary significantly, which creates unequal conditions for gamers and upsets the competitive balance of the game. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26f/938/5b4/26f9385b43305d0790a05b4dc267bf2e.jpg"></div><br>  A dedicated game server can help avoid these problems and provide maximum control over the gaming environment, giving players access 24/7/365, so players in time zones can compete with each other at any time convenient for them. <br><br>  The criteria <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/316590/">to consider when choosing a</a> dedicated game server are similar <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/341228/">to the</a> server <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/341228/">selection criteria</a> for other types of hosting, but there are several key features that should be taken into account. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçPerformance</font> </h3><br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãand performance are probably the most important thing in the game server, and these indicators should be sufficient for the game process.  The server should be a high-quality equipment, optimally equipped with SSD drives, placed on a network with a reliable infrastructure, and access to it should be provided by Internet providers with sufficient network bandwidth and latency. <br><br>  Of course, different games will have different performance requirements, so you should check the available documentation and make sure that a sufficiently powerful server is selected. <br>  For example, for the <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server/Requirements/Dedicated">Minecraft Wiki</a> from Gamepedia, the minimum RAM capacity is 512 MB to 2 GB (depending on which server is used).  The recommendation for Linux servers is 5 GB of RAM for games with three to five players using a graphical interface and 3 GB for five to eight players with consoles.  And this RAM is intended only for the game server, in addition to the RAM used by the OS. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/101/bf5/ac1/101bf5ac1f779129bd97d683423067be.png"></div><br>  A smooth game also depends on the processor‚Äôs sufficient computing power, so choose a server with at least an Intel Core processor or equivalent.  In some cases, use the GPU. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/874/814/dfc/874814dfce60a798078b9dec919442ae.png"></div><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç Reliability</font> </h3><br>  Considering the price as a key factor in the choice of hosting a dedicated game server, you should not forget about reliability, uptime, because hosting with regular failures is certainly less valuable than the one that constantly supports online play.  Hosting with a failure rate of 99% can be considered unreliable (which, however, depends on the requirements), and since the time of no-failure operation 99.996% is quite stable. <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/308764/">Security is</a> also a factor of reliability, especially given the fact that game servers especially <a href="http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/dyn-might-have-been-collateral-damage-in-mirai-attack-on-gaming-infrastructure">attract the attention of hackers</a> .  According to Qrator Labs, the gaming industry ranks third in the world among the targets of DDoS attacks.  A good dedicated server provides protection against DDoS attacks and a powerful firewall. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçEasy management and automation</font> </h3><br>  Since it‚Äôs up to the players to play and not manage the server, the hosting of the game server should offer features such as automatic updates, selection of control panels for administration, one-click software installation and automation of the operating system kernel update without rebooting the server. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçSupport</font> </h3><br>  Online games require constant availability, the game server should work without downtime.  Thus, you need a good hosting provider offering high-quality services and support. <br><br>  Leading hosting providers have professional support staff, which makes it much easier to use their services.  If the games will work at night or on weekends, then you need to look for a provider that offers support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. <br><br>  Some <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/352910/">hosting providers</a> provide game servers for hosting, specialized secure and optimized dedicated servers built on industrial quality equipment, including SSD.  Their network provides high bandwidth and high-speed connections to Internet providers, and customers receive guaranteed security, uninterrupted operation and support. <br><br>  It is necessary to install a base platform on the selected hardware (it can be Linux or Windows), a set of server programs, as well as the server part of the game client itself (it will be responsible for working with network players). <br><br>  But which is better: hosting a game server on Windows VPS or Linux? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be6/c7f/71a/be6c7f71a50d0d58b49613a12bc9042c.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Windows or Linux: which operating system is best for hosting a game server? </h2><br>  <b>Licensing Costs:</b> Choosing Linux under Windows can reduce licensing costs, since Linux is an open source operating system.  However, it is believed that the Linux platform is limited support, or not at all.  On the other hand, the cost of a Windows license is not so significant, and you get full support. <br><br>  <b>Operating environment:</b> if you intend to use a Linux server for games, this means that you are familiar with the Linux platform and are able to manage Linux servers via SSH. <br><br>  <b>GUI:</b> Windows VPS comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) called Remote Desktop ( <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/358630/">RDP</a> ).  It can be used to access and manage your virtual server just as you manage your home PC desktop, while working with Linux VPS requires being a professional and experienced user of the Linux platform.  However, there is also a <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/312556/">GUI</a> for this OS. <br><br>  <b>Maintenance:</b> hosting a game server requires maintenance, configuration, updates, and regular monitoring.  All this can be a headache without a GUI. <br><br>  <b>Price:</b> Linux VPS can be an excellent option if you are technically savvy and somewhat limited in budget.  On the other hand, Windows VPS is a much more convenient option that offers you support, functionality and application support at an affordable price.  If you want to run a game server on a VPS, Linux VPS may be a cheaper option, but not always more suitable. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37a/51d/f35/37a51df3560fd50489433a7a5839a7bb.jpg"></div> <br>  Currently there are hundreds of game hosters in Russia, not to mention foreign companies.  In addition to the hosting itself, they offer additional services, such as backup, technical support, server configuration for client requirements, their support (administration), ready-made templates for games, mods catalogs, patches, etc. <br><br>  Here are some typical VPS plans for a game server: <br><br>  <b>Windows vps</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Windows 2012/2008 <br>  ‚Ä¢ 35 GB of storage space <br>  ‚Ä¢ Monthly traffic 150 GB <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1 GB RAM (guaranteed) <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1 dedicated IP address <br>  ‚Ä¢ 2 virtual processors <br>  ‚Ä¢ Weekly backups <br><br>  <b>Linux VPS</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Unlimited number of websites <br>  ‚Ä¢ Raid 10 20GB Disk Space <br>  ‚Ä¢ 150 GB traffic / month <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fully Managed VPS <br>  ‚Ä¢ 512 MB of RAM (guaranteed) <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1 dedicated IP address <br>  ‚Ä¢ Weekly backups <br>  ‚Ä¢ Connect to 1 Gbps port <br>  All VPS plans should be accompanied by 99.99% uptime and 24/7 support. <br><br>  <b>Is the game server slow?</b>  <b>Try SSD VPS</b> <br><br>  A solid-state drive (SSD) allows you to work with data 100 times faster than HDD.  VPS with SSD storage technology has <a href="https://manage.accuwebhosting.com/knowledgebase/1262/Traditional-VPS-Hosting-vors-SSD-VPS-Hosting-.html">several notable advantages</a> over traditional VPS.  SSD VPS read / write speeds are much faster than SATA hard drives. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffd/fbe/7c0/ffdfbe7c0a56205e30dadb716cf68649.jpg"></div><br>  With the increase in the load on the game server, the probability of failure increases, or it just starts to slow down, causing users to complain.  In this case, it's time to think about switching from a virtual VPS server to a dedicated one.  Symptoms may be: <br><br>  <b>Game performance:</b> slow response, or the server ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù when more users are playing than usual. <br><br>  <b>Resources: The</b> installed game consumes almost all CPU and RAM resources. <br><br>  <b>Number of gamers: the</b> number of players exceeds the one your VPS can handle. <br><br>  <b>Expansion:</b> you need to support more gamers. <br><br>  <b>The number of games on the server:</b> if you use several games, then your VPS may not cope with a large number of requests. <br><br>  All this suggests that it is time to think about upgrading. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79f/292/a28/79f292a28eb9b3b43af229601d1c7a07.jpg"></div><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Troubleshooting problems with hosting a game server: common problems and their solutions</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçErrors when installing the game server</font> </h3><br>  The source may be damaged.  Download a new copy from a trusted supplier and install it.  If any other applications are open on your server and you are trying to install a game server, this may lead to an installation error.  It is necessary to close all the "extra" applications, and then install the game server. <br><br>  Game server requirements are a very important part of the installation.  The game server usually has some specific requirements, such as support for Java plug-ins, .Net Framework, specific drivers, etc. If they are not installed or configured, this can cause an error.  Therefore, it is always helpful to read the documentation before installing. <br><br>  Some game servers give an error when installing from the wizard utility.  In this case, you can try to install the server using the command line. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Game server does not start and gives an error</font> </h3><br>  After successful installation of the game server when you try to start the service, a new error occurs.  Here are some common problems and solutions: <br><br><ul><li>  It is possible that after the installation of the server is completed, it starts automatically, and when you try to start it again, it gives an error.  In this case, you can terminate the current service from the task manager and try to start it again. </li><li>  Some game servers require special privileges to run.  If you are trying to start a service from an account that does not have sufficient permissions, it may generate an error.  In this case, it is worth trying to run it from an administrator account or assign the required rights to your account. </li><li>  The game server works through a specific port.  If the port configured to start the server is used by another application, the server will generate an error and will not allow you to start the service.  In this case, you can either change the port in the game server configuration, or stop the service on the same port to start the server. </li></ul><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Game server crashes while playing</font> </h3><br>  There are numerous possible causes of such incidents, some of which are listed below: <br><br><ul><li>  Your game server works with an outdated or vulnerable version.  Download the latest stable version, and then reinstall it on your server. </li><li>  The server on which your game server is running does not have enough resources to cope with requests, which is why your game server crashes.  To get around this situation, it is worth thinking about upgrading. </li><li>  While the game server is running, several other programs may also function on your server.  Sometimes this background process can cause problems for the game server.  You can try to stop all other current processes, and then check how the game server works. </li></ul><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçAfter restarting the game server, it does not start automatically.</font> </h3><br>  This happens if the service of your game server is not configured to start automatically.  Windows users can check this from the Services menu (Start ‚Üí Administrative Tools ‚Üí Services).  Here you can go to the properties of your game server and go to the "Recovery" tab.  There you can set ‚ÄúRestart service‚Äù values ‚Äã‚Äãfor different parameters. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d43/23e/eba/d4323eeba475db55ffc3110810d261c7.jpg"></div><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Sample game hosting: <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub/game_server">RUVDS</a></font> </h2><br>  Customers of our service receive the following: <br><br><ol><li>  Round-the-clock analytics and monitoring of network traffic to ensure the maximum level of protection against DDoS attacks. </li><li>  Constant access and guaranteed high speed.
