California startup was registered in 2010, and already in 2011 released its first commercial product, named after the company - Striiv. <br><br>  Of course, the company itself would be quite hard to master a new business, but investors who liked the idea proposed by the developers helped. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Company formation </h3>

      The company's founders (ex-employees of Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems) intended to create a device that would monitor the user's activity, and could count the time that a person spends on walking or running. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f4/06e/8de/9f406e8de92001d851019d73cc2427a1.jpg"><br>  This was the first Striiv fitness device. <br><br>  After the idea was framed, a number of investors became interested in it, and one of them, iD Ventures, suggested Striiv Inc.  6 million US dollars investment.  In addition, the investors were the Tallwood Ventures Company and Colin Angle from iRobot, who later became a member of the Striiv Board of Directors. <br><br>  After this, the company went uphill. <br><br>  With a good investment and a great team, the company managed to quickly create an heir to Striiv: <br><br><h3>  Wireless pedometer Striiv Play </h3><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IL2CFx2xuQk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhievAEoW_3YaXapbUCYdJWhAgQybw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This gadget was released in 2012, and was positioned by the manufacturer as a ‚Äúmotivating‚Äù fitness tracker.  In addition to the usual functions, such as counting the number of steps taken, the number of steps overcome, the distance covered and calories burned, the device motivates its owner to work even more actively on himself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79b/b6d/7b3/79bb6d7b3314ee4b9d102e325a0ead10.jpg"><br><br>  So, the pre-installed application for this device (and Striiv Play) already knew how to synchronize with a smartphone on iOS, Android, and Windows 8 (a little later), offers to perform a specific task, for example, to go 200 steps in 15 minutes, earning points.  And this is all in the form of the game MyLand, where you need to change and improve your own island, gradually settling it with animals and plants.  You can also build houses and perform other work on the improvement of the island - and all this for play money received by the user when performing the tasks mentioned above. <br><br>  Despite the fact that <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/besprovodnoj-shagomer-striiv-play-so-smart-tehnologiej.html">Striiv Play was</a> released in 2012, the company continues to provide support for the device, updating software, adding new features. <br><br>  The price of Striiv Play in the Russian Federation is now 2690 rubles <br><br><h3>  Striiv band </h3><br><br>  A little later, the company released a fully-fledged fitness bracelet, designed not only for tracking physical activity, but also for monitoring sleep quality. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2_hEaZl67E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjPBILGTBiPH-aeW7ISKPoEkD3Pfw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At the same time, the gadget does not have a full-fledged display, but there are several LEDs that can be used to determine the training parameters, the activity of the load and other data. <br><br>  Due to the fact that the Striiv Band does not have a display, the device can work longer than gadgets with full-fledged LED screens. <br><br>  Sports bracelet for fitness and sleep Striiv Band tracks the number of steps taken, calories burned and minutes of daily physical activity.  All data received for the day, the device transmits to the smartphone in the appropriate application. <br><br>  By the way, with the help of the device, you can also monitor the power supply.  The fact is that the Striiv Band is the official partner of the largest online medical community MyFitnessPal.  In parallel with the statistics recorded by the Stray Band pedometer, the user gets the opportunity to track their diet. <br><br>  Another advantage of the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/striiv-band.html">Striiv Band</a> is its water resistance.  With the device you can swim, take a shower or bath. <br><br>  The price of Striiv Band in the Russian Federation is now 4,990 rubles. <br><br><h3>  Striiv touch </h3><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mwB7xAKv3O0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgmE0yW5TJZYSnIc_mgzTNvLSDNlw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The next generation of fitness bracelet, already with a display.  The latter is monochrome, which ensures long-term work in offline mode, plus high information content (the display shows information about the quality of sleep, activity level, as well as notifications). <br><br>  In principle, this is not just a tracker, but a hybrid of a smart watch and a smart bracelet.  The device combines the capabilities of a traditional pedometer, wristwatch and sleep tracker. <br><br>  The display is shockproof, plus the case is protected from moisture, so you can take a bath or shower with the Striiv Touch.  True, swimming in the pool is no longer recommended. <br><br>  The battery lasts about 5 days, which can be considered an excellent result. <br><br>  The price of Striiv Touch in the Russian Federation is now 6990 rubles. <br><br><h3>  Striiv fusion </h3><br><br>  This is the latest generation of Finest tracker, presented by Striiv at the very end of 2014.  The device is also a hybrid of smart watches and fitness bracelet. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aLfVjw3sDw0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhr5NqNHRHHW2SF3sWKmWq7189hBA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The device can monitor fitness parameters 24 hours a day, 7 days a week: sleep quality, calculate steps, distances, calories burned.  In smart watch mode, Striiv Fusion notifies you of incoming calls to a paired mobile device, allows you to view text messages and notifications from your smartphone, and share achievements with friends on social networks. <br><br>  Touch screen, monochrome, shockproof.  The device is protected from water, so you can take a shower and a bath with it, and not be afraid to run in the rain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a15/c05/e5e/a15c05e5e1c087d9a6a9175eea995dc7.png"><br><br>  Thanks to its economical display, <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/striiv-fusion.html">Striiv Fusion</a> works for about five days offline.  All measurements and observations are transmitted to the mobile application. <br><br>  The price of Striiv Fusion in the Russian Federation now amounts to 8990 rubles.  Well, and readers of Geektimes, Habrahabr and Megamozg can get a <b>discount</b> of 1000 rubles, using the code <b>Fusion</b> . <br><br>  And yes, you can still play MyLand, spending the play money you received by doing fitness tasks to upgrade your island.  So far, unfortunately, only virtual. <br><br>  As we can see, Striiv Inc.  it is developing quite dynamically, moreover, the development is stable, without attempts to bite off a piece that can not be chewed later - this is a problem for many startups.  The company has existed for five years, and over the years, from a small and little-known manufacturer of pedometers, Striiv has turned into one of the world's most famous smart wearable device companies, whose products are sold throughout the world.  Every year the company releases a new device, and I would like to hope that this year or next will not be an exception.  Some new companies that produce similar gadgets can learn a lot from Striiv. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376899/</a></p>
