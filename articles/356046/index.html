Amendments will be made to the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code, as well as 10 separate laws, <a href="http://ria.ru/society/20160624/1450811020.html">writes</a> RIA.

      The adoption of a package of amendments can have a strong influence on the future of the telecommunications sector in Russia.  This applies to both companies operating in this area and ordinary citizens.  For example, for public calls to terrorism on the Internet or to justify terrorism, punishment is imposed in the form of imprisonment from five to seven years or provides for a fine ranging from 300 thousand to 1 million rubles. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Personal data of subscribers and correspondence </h3><br>  Initially, the authors of the package of amendments proposed to oblige telecom operators to store all data of Russian users in Russia for three years.  This applies to telephone conversations, text messages and images.  According <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274500/">to experts</a> , the budget for the implementation of these proposals would exceed the annual budget of the largest telecom operators in Russia.  The system for storing user data for only one of the companies, VimpelCom, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275684/">would have cost about</a> $ 18 billion. Other companies have previously shown comparable costs for creating the corresponding infrastructure.  At the same time, the annual revenue of operators is much lower than the estimated costs.  So, last year VimpelCom's revenues on the Russian market amounted to $ 4.6 billion, Megafon - $ 5.2 billion, MTS - $ 6.4 billion. <br><br>  Therefore, the amendments have been amended.  Now information about the facts of receiving and transmitting calls, text messages, photos, sounds and video operators will have to be stored in Russia for three years.  The operators themselves are also obliged to keep conversations and correspondence, but not for three years, but six months.  In addition, telecom operators are obliged to provide law enforcement officers with information about their users and the communication services provided to them. <br><br>  The same requirements apply to instant messengers and social networks.  Here, too, there are some indulgences: the retention of data on the facts of message transmission has been reduced from three years to one year.  And the contents of the correspondence of the company will be required to store up to six months.  When using message coding, messengers and social networks are required to provide keys for decoding to the FSB.  In case of non-compliance with the requirement, the citizen will be obliged to pay a fine in the amount of from 3 to 5 thousand rubles;  official - from 30 to 50 thousand rubles;  legal entity - from 800 thousand to 1 million rubles.  The FSB was also exempted from the need to compensate for the damage incurred during the special operations. <br><br>  So far, the order, timing and amount of information storage has not been established, this issue should be decided by the government of the Russian Federation. <br><br><h3>  Disclosure of state secrets </h3><br>  For the media, a separate punishment is now envisaged for disclosing information ‚Äúconstituting a state secret or another secret specially protected by law‚Äù.  The guilty edition will be obliged to pay a fine of up to one million rubles.  Until now, punishment for such an offense has not been provided. <br><br><h3>  When does the amendment take effect? </h3><br>  The new regulation on the storage of transferred data takes effect on July 1, 2018. <br><br><h3>  Possible difficulties in the implementation of amendments </h3><br>  The fact that the acceptance of the proposal to store data and correspondence of subscribers may lead to an increase in communication tariffs was previously <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274707/">warned by the</a> Head of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media Nikolay Nikiforov.  ‚Äú... it is technically possible to realize this, but it is extremely difficult and extremely costly - we are talking about huge amounts of expenses.  Therefore, we will present the corresponding calculations to the legislators.  If the bill is in its current form, it will lead to a dramatic increase in prices for communication services.  I am sure that neither deputies, nor the State Duma, nor our citizens want this, ‚Äùthe minister said.  He also said that it is not yet possible to store all subscriber data, it is advisable to save only information about the fact of making calls and sending messages to subscribers. <br><br>  According to Pyotr Lidov, director of public relations for OJSC Megafon, communications operators are likely to be reimbursed by ordinary citizens.  He believes that the main benefits of the implementation of the package of amendments will be suppliers of equipment for storage systems.  And this is probably American or Chinese companies, that is, the money will go abroad, and not into the budget. <br><br>  Another complication is the need to develop a strong encryption system for the stored user data.  This is evidenced by the director of the Regional Public Center for Internet Technologies Sergey Grebennikov.  According to him, the cost of developing and implementing such a system <a href="https://rublacklist.net/18173/">will also be huge</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b73/5cb/5ce/b735cb5ced0041952572480a13cce5c8.jpg"><br><br>  As for the disclosure of encryption keys - firstly, not all companies are able to provide such keys.  In the same WhatsApp messenger, encryption is carried out at <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/273884/">the user level</a> , information is not stored on the server.  The company itself will not be able to decipher user data at the request of the police, even if it wants to do this (for example, by a court decision).  Encryption keys may refuse to provide Facebook, will not be able to meet the requirements of the FSB and Telegram, where end-to-end encryption also works. ‚Äù <br><br>  The vice-president and technical director of MailRu Group, Vladimir Gabrielyan, <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/opinions/business/23/06/2016/576be9c99a79470862790d2d">also believes</a> that cybercriminals can easily get to the stored information of users of small operators.  Small companies are simply not able to ensure the safety of a large array of user data.  This can lead to a situation where in the network for a small amount you can buy records of telephone conversations of subscribers of small telecom operators. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356046/</a></p>
