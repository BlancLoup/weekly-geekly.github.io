  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Trends raised to the cult</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The last few years have been marked by the emergence of a large number of new terms, concepts, technologies, trends.  Also, a sufficient number of bazvords appeared that filled the media space.  And flooded to such an extent that many IT people begin to succumb to the temptations and temptations of drawing golden perspectives.  But I will not speak in riddles - under the cut a list of concepts with which a large number of hopes, holivars and ... errors are connected.  Let's see what's what. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Html5 and bright future </h4><br>  In terms of the number of mentions in the HTML5 media space, probably even such a common notion as ‚ÄúTits Semenovich‚Äù won.  About HTML5 does not say except that lazy.  Big players have been installed on HTML5: Microsoft abandoned the Silverlight web, flash is not supported on iPads and iPhones, PhoneGap, jquery.mobile, canvas - all this indicates that the future is already here. <br><br>  The problem is that HTML5 was loaded on too much.  Here you can draw graphics, games, SmartTV and cross-platform applications, etc.  The problem is that there are too many people talking about this who have never seen the HTML5 specification.  And just that, in any conversation: "but I heard that html5 ...". <br><br>  No, HTML5 itself is undoubtedly the right step, but it‚Äôs in theory.  Practice shows something completely different. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      So: <br><br>  - HTML5 specification will not be approved soon (hi W3C!); <br>  - the current situation on the browser market indicates that in the struggle for the championship to implement another fashionable, but fuck no-one needed function, we lose all the same cross-browser compatibility to which we are so eager; <br>  - the situation with browsers is even more deplorable now than 10 years ago - no one can handle such a browser zoo (including mobile ones) that will not allow writing cross-browser applications in the near future; <br>  - the same situation makes you choose which side you are on - webkit (chrome, safari, ipad, iphone) or ie (windows phone, windows 8); <br>  - in HTML5 there are a lot of flaws - for example, it may take you a week to deepen into semantic features - semantic tags, roles, ARIA, etc. <br><br>  And if we add a huge increase in the popularity of JavaScript and its derivatives (from jquery to metro applications for Windows 8), then it becomes absolutely scary :-) <br><br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/gisardo/status/225986061950668802">Interesting shift: from "all about open web", to "works better in Chrome", to "works ONLY in Chrome" # html5 #nomore</a> <br><br>  And this is just the beginning. <br><br><h4>  Startups </h4><br>  Startups are everywhere.  If you do not have your startup - you are a sucker.  You're a stupid office cattle, who can not even create a blog on WordPress.  Vaughn, a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/148253/">17-year-old boy, has already created 4 startups</a> while you were sitting on VKontakte and reading Habr. <br><br>  But now the startup party is everywhere.  Now even a new kind of start-ups has appeared - the creation of sites with a list of startups.  The main thing is that they should be written in Ruby on Rails, because  <a href="http://www.siliconrus.com/2012/07/stipster/">if your startup is written in Java, Python or (oh no!) ASP.NET, you are practically doomed</a> . <br><br>  You have not downloaded the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">set of young bootstrapper</a> ?  What are you waiting for?  And don't forget to call Moreina, they‚Äôre waiting for you. <br><br>  I hope that hysteria with startups will end soon and we will return to building a bright future. <br><br><h4>  Agile, Scrum and other channels </h4><br>  Only parties of lovers of flexible methodologies can compare with the number of start-up parties. <br><br>  At one time, when Agile had not yet entered tightly into our lives, I thought that I simply could not understand such a thing as flexible methodologies.  <a href="http://xn-----clcksaplxf6byd3cyb.xn--p1ai/">Write the code, fuck</a> - everything that I knew and knew how and that was our everything.  Well, still GDD - google driven development. <br><br>  After attending several conferences, including international ones, at which I had the opportunity to listen to flexible methodologies from the first mouth, I realized one simple and obvious thing: simple and obvious things are told to us.  Only earlier it was called adequacy and common sense, and now - edzheyl. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the emergence of such a thing as agile brought, in my opinion, more harm than good. <br><br>  Here are the reasons that I highlighted for myself: <br><br>  - adjaylists are often more obsessed with the process, rather than with the result; <br>  - very often the teams in which they begin to introduce flexible methodologies do not meet the minimum requirements for teams where flexible methodologies can and should be implemented; <br>  - no one answered me clearly how to evaluate the velocities of a team that does not yet exist (146% is a real case), and the contract is already signed; <br>  - Adjalers often naively believe that flexible methodologies can and should be applied everywhere.  This is not true; <br>  - there are no adequate evaluation criteria and statistics for comparing the results of development using different methodologies; <br>  - each company, team, scrum master has his own understanding of flexible methodologies; <br>  - the presence of a scram-board does not automatically make the project a success. <br><br>  But I found for myself one situation where flexible methodologies work - with an adequate team leader and an adequate team.  However, in this case, scrum to the ass - and so everything will be fine with them. <br><br><h4>  SMM and other marketing nonsense </h4><br>  Now it is fashionable to talk about SMM.  Twitter, trends, SMM, ROI, social networks and graphs - <a href="http://www.happy-pm.com/blog/%3Fp%3D2438">bingo</a> ! <br><br>  There is no effective promotion in social networks.  At least for now. <br><br>  A large company collects 25 thousand likes in 2 years, a political article - 12.5 thousand likes in one and a half days.  Create your own trend in twitter no one has enough money and opportunities. <br><br>  Promotion and advertising is contrary to the essence of social networks.  According to my search queries and email, it is theoretically possible to create my ‚Äúconsumer portrait‚Äù, but this is terribly difficult to do with facebook, VKontakte and twitter.  I think that such monetization models will appear, but a little later.  At that moment, social networks can already be transformed into something else. <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  The considered concepts have densely entered our life.  I by no means call to stop going to start-up parties, delete the source code of your bootstrapping project or ban on facebook. <br><br>  I'm just talking about the need to treat the "trends" more restrained.  More to analyze the facts, and less to succumb to emotions and provocations.  More trust in knowledge and experience, rather than advice from overseas books or uncles with 20k greens, which they proudly ‚Äúput into new facebook‚Äù.  Less to read Murtazins and diddenkov, and more - the fundamental books (including related sciences for IT people and domains) and thematic resources.  Less to fall for beautiful words and more to look inside. <br><br>  And yes, when you go to the next startup party, tell us about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup - a list of clones instagram, be sure to tell me what you will write on RoR and HTML5, and you will use kanban.  And then exactly <a href="http://www.siliconrus.com/">Zuckenberg will call!</a> <br><br>  Good luck bootstrapping and, by tradition, thank you for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148425/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148425/</a></p>
