      The company knows how to surprise - this time it was necessary to be in the basement room of the center of modern art ‚ÄúWinzavod‚Äù, in the red shop.  The gloomy situation was brightened by bright luminous demonstration stands on which the achievements of modern computer and laptop engineering stood <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/384/7d2/871/3847d2871f18a24f94214453cb42e09e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As always - wandering bearded and pot-bellied guys, representatives of leading IT-communities and publications.  What is nice - every time more and more familiar faces;) The long-legged girls in ‚Äúprocessor‚Äù dresses turned out to be a contrasting shower - but what, what event would they be without) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0f/26e/cc8/b0f26ecc84c29f1b2a86ce184f404303.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Dmitry Konash</b> , Intel Regional Director for Russia and other CIS countries, started talking about the main event of the event.  He described to the audience the situation in the computer market, reinforcing what was said with the presentation slides. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/578/469/46c/57846946cf0767fd7650d9ab8fc7d2f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In short, the number of computers per cubic meter of space continues to increase, and at the same time the level of users connected to the Internet is also increasing.  So, for example, from December 2000 to June 2009, the number of "connected" grew by as much as 360% - from 361 million to 1.66 billion!  Naturally, in this situation, technological progress simply can not stand still.  Therefore, new processors are designed to help keep pace with the times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31e/419/69e/31e41969e619f6d3897aec9435537265.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I have already talked about the new processors.  In order not to repeat, I will highlight three key features: <br><br>  <b>1</b> .  They are manufactured according to the advanced 32-nanometer manufacturing process, which, on the one hand, embodies Moore‚Äôs law at the next stage of the microprocessor industry evolution, and on the other hand, allows for even higher degree of integration of elements, reducing their energy consumption and heat generation. <br><br>  <b>2</b>  The new Intel Core processors are distinguished by ‚Äúsmart‚Äù performance, i.e.  hardware ability to dynamically adapt to current working conditions, providing the user with increased performance when it is really necessary, and reducing power consumption up to the complete shutdown of non-working components when power is not required.  This is provided by a number of technologies such as <b>Intel Turbo Boost</b> and <b>Intel Hyper-Threading</b> , which are briefly described below. <br><br>  <b>3</b>  New items have a graphics <b>Intel HD Graphics</b> , which is integrated in a single package with a processor, as well as a two-channel memory controller, placed on a chip.  This somewhat changed the principle of the arrangement of the entire platform, but allowed to win, again, in the level of integration of elements and reduce energy consumption. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d68/a8b/026/d68a8b0266fc77226a5a3a561d46070b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the most obvious advantages is the support of smooth viewing of high-definition video, which is possible even without installing a discrete video card.  The platform also supports multi-channel sound Dolby TrueHD and DTS Premium Suite, and at the same time - is fully compatible with Microsoft Windows 7. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/23d/09b/33023d09b216db85bf0a50936a398b81.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A little later, <b>Alexey Rogachkov</b> , an Intel technical specialist in Russia and other CIS countries, joined the performance.  He told (and, most pleasantly, clearly showed) some of the charms of the new processors.  So, for example, Intel Turbo Boost technology was vividly demonstrated - dynamic adaptive acceleration control of one or two cores at the hardware level.  By the way, anyone can download the <b><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx%3Fagr%3DY%26DwnldID%3D18353">Intel TurboBoost Monitor</a></b> program on the Internet and evaluate the optimization of this or that application. <br>  Using the example of the <b><a href="http://freestone-group.com/video-card-stability-test.htm">VideoCard Stability Test</a></b> program, a ‚Äúnotebook feature‚Äù was demonstrated - the ability of new integrated video systems to change their frequency depending on the load.  At regular 500 MHz, the frequency under load has increased to 767 MHz, and in idle mode it dropped to 367 - I think that such a hardware skill will also affect the battery life.  A little later, <b>Intel Switchable Graphics</b> technology will be present on laptops, allowing you to switch between integrated and discrete (if available) video cards without rebooting. <br><br>  The demonstration of the <b>Intel vPro</b> technology was also <b>vivid</b> - a technology of remote access to a computer that operates at the hardware level.  In general, the same Radmin, only you can see someone else's screen, even when the computer only turns on or, for example, when the "patient" does not have drivers for the network card!  It really impressed and more will definitely tell about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e67/c8e/a9f/e67c8ea9fa3c5c513dea637eb83be048.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A few words were told about new network adapters, which will now be hiding under the brand Intel Centrino.  The new wireless adapters have enhanced support for 802.11n multi-stream data transmission and dual-band Wi-Fi support, offering higher speeds with, again, reduced power consumption.  Now the line of Intel devices includes Intel WiMAX / WiFi Combo adapters that support 2.3 GHz frequency bands;  2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz (WiMAX).  According to Dmitry Konash, support of a wide range of frequencies will allow, for example, to use WiMAX both in Moscow (2.5 GHz) and in Kiev (3.5 GHz).  Taking this opportunity, Russia is the leader in the number of WiMAX users, beating Japan and the states by orders of magnitude. <br><br>  Well, along the way put in a word about the technology (presented at CES 2010), <b>Intel Wireless Display</b> .  In short, most laptops will soon be able to transfer an image to a large TV without any wires (for which, however, a special adapter will have to be bought into the HDMI connector of the panel).  Up to the transfer of high-definition movies. <br>  In the end, the speakers answered questions from the audience. <br><br>  I have already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/80276/">talked</a> about the technical characteristics of the stones, we can only summarize - the new processors (no matter how strange it may sound) have become noticeably more productive when performing the whole range of tasks.  For us, all of this means nothing less ‚Äî an increase in productivity at a price that has practically not grown! <br><br>  After the demonstration part was over, the chipman in the production suit pulled out the first two business cards from the vase, the owners of which offered to fight for the laptop with the newest processor.  No, not in the ring ... although the object shown to visitors can be considered as such. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e94/a97/e23/e94a97e2319da0b30f2475e951eba71f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b1/732/397/3b1732397c54c6559571296481be7443.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Visitors moved to a small art object "Quick Minds" from the SILA design team, the base of which was a processor substrate, and already there were three bust of great scientists (Aristotle, Hippocrates and Lomonosov) printed on a 3D printer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fe/051/d2d/6fe051d2da5205238f2db8b3172f313a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Two lucky guys were given radio control consoles in their hands, and two more heads appeared on the ‚Äúring‚Äù, but more nimble ‚Äî with wheels) Playfully, it was necessary to ‚Äúpush‚Äù the enemy from the ‚Äúcarriageway‚Äù - Dmitry Chekanov, Editor-in-Chief of Tom‚Äôs Hardware Guide Russia, driving Lomonosov;) Know ours! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2dd/700/1ef/2dd7001ef7bc621ee0721499647529d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/438/719/414/438719414a5170a12015a7bf6a6688fc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/106/71f/291/10671f29129805eb3269b03dbe3118ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the head-on collisions of great geniuses, the people broke up - someone consumed the products of the winery and all kinds of salads, someone studied the display boards, and someone just talked peacefully.  Everyone who wanted was also given the opportunity to steer geniuses - the winners were given wonderful ‚Äúrobo-dogs‚Äù :) One of whom is now seated on my desk and shows the temperature, time, day of the week and playfully winks with his ears every time you get to him) In the best traditions of DealExtreme) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f02/0ca/b81/f020cab81d084fd28df2343e1288bba4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the demonstration stands, large manufacturing companies showed their products - everyone could feel the freshly baked notebooks from ASUS, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony, Toshiba and others.  Distributors took the opposite side of the hall - they showed nettops, monoblocks and other stationary solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20a/324/83a/20a32483ae6028eec674827d82c483f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f5/b72/c4e/2f5b72c4e148520df8e39dcb0200da77.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/626/97e/32d/62697e32dfc66646a3f15afeee9adac1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5d/762/52f/f5d76252f7fac62e189cdbbdb1e7487f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edd/c8e/02f/eddc8e02ff11aa8fb6370c033745a0e5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/385/2ef/b0b/3852efb0b50832f4b250e73e119c726a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e96/2d3/00b/e962d300ba0f27b18de089a6cee3c914.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/167/23e/512/16723e512304670905f5189e06b4fee1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Suddenly! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c8/5de/c64/1c85dec646af1121683aa3f1383815b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way.  Noticing in the last post technological interest of a couple of harabrachitel, invited them to the event - one of them came from Peter). Perhaps he will also tell something. <br>  And, taking this opportunity - if someone from Kazakhstan is reading us and wants to attend such an event (which will take place soon) - write in a personal. <br><br>  A couple of months ago I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/73876/">wrote</a> about the company's plans for 2010 - then everything was shrouded in NDA fog ... and who would have thought that after a month or two, the new processors could become our real assistants.  And at least something revolutionary or conceptual company did not show, apparently, the future and the truth for the Intel Core;) <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81373/</a></p>
