  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some myths about callback services that we sometimes come across</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Several myths about callback services have been circulated among the public, which, it must be admitted, often create a negative image.  This is due to the fact that one of the largest players in the market at one time focused on marketing and leopards, bathing in a cauldron and speeches about ‚Äúsuccessful success‚Äù.  As is often the case, one or several players may discredit the whole niche, as a result of which myths appear.  Today we, <a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">Rocket Callback</a> , have collected several such myths that we personally encounter every day, and in the best traditions of MythBusters will try to destroy them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c1/86d/646/0c186d6463f74cb093b20f6d91d1e40e.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Myth 1: This is an obsessive popup that annoys and annoys everyone </h5><br>  Before we saw our own widget, we tried out the products of future competitors and realized that this was indeed the case - an obsessive popup that personally made us incredibly mad.  All these windows appeared at the most inopportune moment, annoyingly offering a call when we simply read the program of the event or thoughtfully read the content on the site.  That is why we decided to make the widget customizable and it was possible to completely turn off the ‚Äúfloating‚Äù window.  A little later, this function was adopted by all the other widgets, so today, whatever the callback widget you install, it will surely have a similar setting.  Making the window intrusive or not depends entirely on who installs it on the site. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
    <h5>  Myth 2: This is a short-term benefit - it does not work at all in the long run. </h5><br>  Just the opposite is true.  The longer the widget is on the site, the more it collects data and learns to interact with users.  For example, if you once visited the site, a window popped up in front of you and you used callback, then your next visit will not offer you anything.  The widget already knows that you are aware of the possibility of a callback, and if necessary, call the window yourself by clicking on the button.  Plus, the widget collects information about user behavior (transitions, movements, requests, sources), it all rolls into Hadoop on Azure, runs in Machine Learning, and identifies the factors for each individual site.  Plus, we also write algorithms on R to optimize the display of the widget. <br><br><h5>  Myth 3: This is an expensive toy. </h5><br>  Today, there is intense competition on the market and a large selection of widgets - from very cheap to very expensive.  Widget increases the number of calls, but not customers - this is the responsibility of the manager.  For example, one call can cost $ 1, and if the manager can close at least 5 out of 10 transactions (and this is real, because the client is warm), then the expenses will be paid off with interest.  Plus, IP-telephony is used, and therefore, the price of a call does not depend on geography.  You are in Moscow, and the client is in Vladivostok, you are in St. Petersburg, and the client is in Mountain View - the price of the conversation will be the same.  Our price is almost at cost - about 7 rubles per minute. <br><br><h5>  Myth 4: It is ineffective and scam </h5><br>  Callback widget turns traffic into calls.  No traffic - no party, as they say.  The more traffic on the site, the higher the number of calls.  But even a site with attendance of 50 guests can count on 5-10 calls per day.  In fact, this is a replacement for online consultants and online chat rooms, and a sort of seller on the site.  The widget delivers hot clients, and how effectively the manager will be able to process them and close the transaction is entirely dependent on the company.  So if you hear how some callback-service promises you hundreds <s>of</s> customers' <s>oil</s> , success and happiness, then run away - in principle, it is not capable of it. <br><br><h5>  Myth 5: It's naked marketing without programming. </h5><br>  In fact, the ratio is about 50 to 50. For example, we tried to create a project at the junction of marketing and programming.  The most important thing is hidden from view - this is also IP-telephony, so that the connection is good outside-depending on geography, and the algorithm of the widget, so that it does not pop up in a random order, and analysis of user actions, and the administration panel, and much more.  For example, the algorithm we have is based on 16 factors, of which 4 are dynamic, and 12 static are movement, scrolling, source, transitions, time on the site, heat map of clicks, and so on. <br><br><h5>  Myth 6: Who needs callback when there are online chats? </h5><br>  Online chat is definitely a good tool, which is not very suitable for large transactions, when it is more convenient to negotiate through the phone.  Plus, the human factor is important here - people like to talk on the phone and they like communicating with another person.  Another important factor is the wow effect.  For some reason, people react very violently to being called back within a few seconds, which makes them even warmer. <br><br><h5>  Myth 7: Calling is only needed for landings and for those who sell something from the site. </h5><br>  Yes, the majority of widget clients are Landings and small companies, but more often large-scale sites that provide offline services are buying minutes.  These are beauty salons, car services, language centers, coworking services, repair services, tourist portals and many others.  Online stores are not the first in the list of customers callback widgets.  For example, here is Rocket on the <a href="http://lpbuilding.ru/">site of the</a> studio engaged in the creation of landing pages, here it is on <a href="http://ultraclinica.ru/">the</a> clinic <a href="http://ultraclinica.ru/">website</a> , and here on the <a href="http://www.lingva.in/">website of the</a> publishing house of educational literature and audio training.  Here is <a href="http://subtotal.ru/">one IT startup</a> , and here is the <a href="http://kurort.perm.ru/">site of the</a> Perm resort.  All this is our long-standing clients with whom we have been cooperating for a long time. <br><br>  That's all the myths that we, in the <a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">Rocket Callback</a> , usually come across, and which we usually try to destroy in a dialogue with customers.  It does not always work, but we do not despair. <br><br>  Thank you for reading us. <br>  Subscribe to our <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/rocketcallback">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290196/</a></p>
