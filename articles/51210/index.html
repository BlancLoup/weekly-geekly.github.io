  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google and its contribution to the promotion of sites for the realization of his own dream</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone, and maybe not everyone (they will be interested just in time) know about Google Analytics (http://google.com/analytics/) - this is a good system that allows you to very accurately and competently present reports on web site traffic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39d/0b8/f80/39d0b8f809e1030f93f4dee22d7491f2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Question: Why does google.com provide such a service?  There are two answers. <br>  1 is commercial, that is, google.com takes money for using this system from commercial institutions. <br>  2 - all much more globally.  Although the second answer is obvious, I understood it from my own experience. <br><br>  The fact is that when developing a web site, the task of good indexing and getting targeted attendance is set (for the site to bring profit) - this is the task of the developer.  To accomplish this task, the developer needs to sweat well over the site code, keywords, texts, and so on.  And it gives its results.  The site is indexed, attendance and first orders appear ... <br><br>  After some time, I learned about Google Analytics, registered and gladly analyzed the daily traffic of my site.  The system is really quite convenient.  And what is interesting, the traffic to my site began to grow little by little, but steadily grow !!! <br>  Why did it happen?  Let's think about it. <br>  Search engine google.com sets itself the goal of the most accurate search result that meets the query.  And as we see google.com does a relatively good job with this task.  But, as emerges from this article, google.com does not stop improving <br>  search results.  It was to improve the search and the Google Analytics service was created, because in this case the google.com search engine knows much more about our site than about anything else. <br>  So, with the corresponding requests (which interest us), google.com is more likely to show our website, which is more accurate according to the data received from Google Analytics, and responds to the request.  And that is why the traffic to my site began to grow, gradually but steadily. <br>  Why little and stable?  Let's analyze according to the traffic of my site.  Among the large number of queries there are so-called ‚Äúlow-frequency queries‚Äù, and they more clearly carry the semantic root of the query.  It is for such semantic (but low-frequency) queries google.com that shows our site in the first places.  Why? <br>  Because our site best responds to this request, according to the same data that comes from Google Analytics.  That is why attendance is growing slowly but steadily.  That is why the number of orders is increasing, because a person who is looking for something ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù finds exactly the site that this ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù offers and with greater accuracy from the same region.

      As you can see, the company google.com does not cease to go to its goal-toss (like yandex.ru with metrics), that is, to the most accurate search result. <br>  For which I personally thank, as there is an order from the site that I wish to everyone. <br><br>  Only one "but." <br>  This works well only in the case of competent work with the site code, keywords and texts. <br>  After that, you can safely put Google Analytics and be sure - the result will be. <br><br>  Good luck. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51210/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51210/</a></p>
