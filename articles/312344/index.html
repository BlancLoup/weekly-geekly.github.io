I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_HomeSite">HomeSite</a> back in the 1990s, during my student years.  The first was, it seems, Allaire HomeSite 2 brought to a diskette from a nearby hostel.  For years, it was for me the main code-based editor of everything + search for the hard drive.

      The current version was purchased by me in 2008 already from Adobe.  The file downloaded from the site was an installer compiled by Macromedia in 2005, and in it was a 2003 setup.  Thus, the exe-file installed by me is dated August 25, 2003. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fa/795/4f3/9fa7954f3dfb4630b4156ca8c704a9ad.png"><br><br>  I‚Äôm telling this romantic story about Homesite acquisition in such detail because there are no reasonable reasons to use it in 2016.  It was also written under the Win9x line, and under WinNT, it can randomly beat the Cyrillic when inserted through the buffer.  He does not understand UTF-8.  He ... Well ... In general, I have long been moved to Notepad ++. <br><br>  But each time, I solemnly take out this installa and put it on a new laptop.  For 8 years, she visited me on WinXP, Vista, Win7, Win8 and now - Win10.  And I know for sure that it works and is just as buggy as it was on August 25, 2003. <br><br><h3>  Statistics from Kaspersky Application Advisor on October 7, 2016 </h3><br>  <a href="http://whitelisting.kaspersky.com/advisor-ru">This month we were 38</a> .  Hold on, people, and know that I am with you in my soul. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de8/0b6/dee/de80b6deee2540a881044566a58582c5.png"><br><br><h3>  ‚Ññ2 SSH Secure Shell Client 3.2.9 </h3><br>  But about this already workhorse from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_Communications_Security">ssh.com</a> .  I myself am light of the fact that I have been using an SSH client for 13 years (exe-file is dated October 8, 2003) and a little rubbish.  Slightly reassure myself with the idea that if this client couldn‚Äôt know anything that is now considered safe, then the server would stop accepting it.  And since they still agree to talk with him, then the old man is still fit. <br><br>  Then it's time for you to tell me that the pond is full of fish, the street is full of beautiful girls, and there are many different ssh clients on the internet.  Well, tell me somebody: ‚ÄúMisha, we can still understand why you grabbed hold of HomeSite, here, here and there that you rest‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e7/cb7/4c2/6e7cb74c241749018db657525477ab8f.png"><br><br>  Well, let's take the points: <br><br>  1) If you logged out, you can open a new window of the console or file manager in one click, without re-entering the password. <br>  2) The console window understands Shift-Ins and Control-Ins. <br>  3) Two-pane file manager. <br>  4) File manager supports Copy-Paste and Drag'n'Drop files from other Windows locations. <br>  5) Password managers who know how to work with applications integrate with the password entry form. <br><br>  Think about it, the binary is 13 years old, and it is still efficient and successfully integrates with the operating system.  WinXP, Vista, Win7, Win8 and now - Win10.  Yes, here we have it in Windows - if the software is written correctly, then in decades it will work just as well with the Windows API as it was on the day of compilation. <br><br>  Tell me which of the modern ssh-clients knows at least the first 4 points and I will transfer this stewardess to the honorary category as HomeSite. <br><br>  I agree to consider the option only with the first two points, and shift the work with files to Filezilla. <br><br>  Give me an option that will work reliably in the next 10-15 years and I am ready to spend time on its development. <br><br><h3>  Statistics from Kaspersky Application Advisor on October 7, 2016 </h3><br>  <a href="http://whitelisting.kaspersky.com/advisor-ru">900 people per day.</a>  More than 4 thousand per month.  Very good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58f/84e/5dd/58f84e5dd3d14a0cb526b09c7cbf2fde.png"><br><br><h3>  ‚Ññ3 ReGet Deluxe 5.2 </h3><br>  In its latest update, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReGet">ReGet</a> made a gift to the world - it became free.  This is exactly the version dated July 5, 2008 that I have.  In the same way as in the case of number 2 of this list, I continue to use this program for purely utilitarian reasons. <br><br>  But there is one bonus.  When a ReGet triangle hangs in your tray, Vladimir Romanov floats in Facebook's ribbon with exactly the same green triangle on the avatar, then using the regelet becomes, well ... cozier or something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3be/6ae/1a8/3be6ae1a87ab4957851430b481f2d251.png"><br><br>  I will not say that his queue is stored in an xml file, about a bunch of his settings, about headers for each download.  Well, this is a banality that many have. <br><br>  Let's again about integration.  In 2008, ReGet could integrate into IE and FF.  Figures from Mozilla very quickly made it so that integration with FF fell off.  But I just launched IE11 yesterday and right-clicked it and called ‚ÄúDownload All.‚Äù <br><br>  Of course, you can say that there are many plugins in FF.  Well, yes, I know these your plugins.  Tomorrow, the Firefox developers will again drop something and you will again be worn on an Internet as stung in search of new workable plug-ins.  Here are all the years that I use the software from this list, the plug-in fans in Firefox are worn out with bulging eyes, shouting ‚Äúaaaaaaa, it stopped working again‚Äù. <br><br>  I repeat once again, for those who do not understand: the program that was last updated in 2008 successfully integrates into the current version of Internet Explorer.  And this is a merit of ReGet developers and Internet Explorer developers. <br><br><h3>  Statistics from Kaspersky Application Advisor on October 7, 2016 </h3><br>  <a href="http://whitelisting.kaspersky.com/advisor-ru">Sparely, yes.</a>  Although more than HomeSite 5.5 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad6/365/196/ad63651965c04fac9290ca23d5d5b10c.png"><br><br><h3>  # 4 Paint Shop Pro X2 </h3><br>  The brainchild of Jasc, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro">now owned by Corel</a> .  Professional raster graphics editor.  It is several times cheaper than Adobe Photoshop and runs even on a netbook. <br><br>  Dating exe-file - April 10, 2008.  Was purchased in the fall of the same year in a paper box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84e/605/7dc/84e6057dca4242b2872d1263a7ffccc4.png"><br><br>  There will be no examples and justifications.  What are they for?  Someone has doubts that the graphical editor compiled in 2008 will work under Vista, and under Win7, and under Win8.  And now on Win10 is running. <br><br>  In fact, the question of the possibility of working on the old software is not only an opportunity to use what has not been updated for a long time, but also the possibility not to update what is being updated. <br><br>  I prefer to study new and improve my cognitive abilities on more interesting and creative tasks than learning a new look of ‚Äúeven more iconic icons‚Äù and a ‚Äúeven more intuitive menu‚Äù scheme. <br><br>  If someone wants to show me how the Gimp assembled in 2008 will start, without finishing, in modern environments, then I will look with interest. <br><br>  For now, how many of us are there? <br><br><h3>  Statistics from Kaspersky Application Advisor on October 7, 2016 </h3><br>  <a href="http://whitelisting.kaspersky.com/advisor-ru">Less than 100 per month</a> , but this is only the Russian boxed version.  In all versions of "Paint Shop Pro X2" goes more than 5 thousand per month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ab/d44/b03/8abd44b033ed42949fa6736d8c14daec.png"><br><br><h3>  ‚Ññ5 MAGIX Video deluxe 17 Plus </h3><br>  How they love these pretentious names.  Ultra-premium extra deluxe.  Another ‚ÄúPRO‚Äù is missing. <br><br>  So, by my standards, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magix_Software_GmbH">MAGIX</a> Video deluxe 17 Plus is a new one.  I started to use it as a trikalk in October 2010 (I made videos on a netbook on a trip to Europe).  The full version, after rolling in all existing patches, has an exe file dated May 27, 2011. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/143/5b9/441/1435b94417274000bb49cefb32173ba9.png"><br><br>  Vista, Win7, Win8, Win10 - everything is as usual.  The main criterion for choosing this particular program was her consent to work on a netbook.  Actually, it is CONSENT. <br><br>  All other video editors for non-linear editing said that the screen 1024x600 is not enough for them and I would like at least 800 pixels in height. <br><br>  And so far, no problems associated with the transition to the new OS have arisen.  Drivers, codecs, hardware, operating system version.  A well-written application program should not be worried about it - it has a Windows API and it works with it. <br><br><h3>  Statistics from Kaspersky Application Advisor on October 7, 2016 </h3><br>  <a href="http://whitelisting.kaspersky.com/advisor-ru">740 people around the world.</a>  See the list of countries - I have a real European video editor.  Perhaps in Russia he is only with me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a30/0a3/be8/a300a3be856d4a2bb086121301f63981.png"><br><br>  * * * <br><br>  And now the promised holivar.  Hints at him were in the descriptions, but now in full growth. <br><br><h3>  Stewardess missed the canonical TOP5 - WinDirStat 1.1.2.80 </h3><br>  The most primitive program, dated July 16, 2005.  He considers the size of the folders and shows funny colored squares. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e16/487/a58/e16487a5872e4d28951e69c8eed5494a.png"><br><br>  And, as you can guess, the program works fine to this day.  WinXP, Vista, Win7, Win8, Win10 - everything is as usual. <br><br>  But there is one nuance.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinDirStat">WinDirStat</a> had a prototype in the form of KDirStat Linux software with similar functionality.  The main words here - "was."  KDirStat died with another KDE update 10 years ago. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt understand how you live there in your Linux, when any [bad person] may want to boast to his companions what new cool code he now knows how to write and you will have to look again, select and learn a new application program.  And all this time you could spend on more productive activities. <br><br><h3>  Statistics from Kaspersky Application Advisor on October 7, 2016 </h3><br>  I'm <a href="http://whitelisting.kaspersky.com/advisor-ru">not the only one</a> not fashionable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/511/01f/7cd/51101f7cd6794bfdb300a376ec1785da.png"><br><br>  * * * <br><br>  According to the classic, practice is the criterion of truth.  And this text is not so much the loading of the substance into the fan (although the familiar fryashny admin said ‚Äúthrowing naked‚Äù), as the report on the experiments confirming statements from ancient disputes. <br><br>  1) You can laugh for a very long time over the Snow White DVD patch, the absence of Windows 9 and the binary stuffed with ballast to maintain compatibility with DOS of shaggy years, but the fact remains that there is <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/103598/">real backward compatibility</a> in Windows and this makes the user's life more comfortable.  Unlike Linux. <br><br>  2) With long-term use with a ‚Äúper license‚Äù payment, the cost of an hour of work will tend to zero.  And it will be much less than in the case of "subscription model". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312344/</a></p>
