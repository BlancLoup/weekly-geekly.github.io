  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Last chances of politicians or poor children (about one poor website of the Ukrainian government)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Recently, namely on September 21 of this year, it was announced about the imminent opening of the website of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine for children.  To admit such an announcement was slightly surprised, suddenly a children's Internet resource is created, and even under the patronage of the Cabinet of Ministers, and not the Ministry of Education, as it would be logical to assume, especially the opening of the site was planned for the 27th, just before the elections.  A seditious thought involuntarily arises in my head, isn‚Äôt this another PR action?  But, really, let's not search for all policies, discard the election paranoia and assume that the site is open for good purposes.  Below is a quote from the announcement of the opening of the Internet page: <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúOn the pages of the site, children will be able to get information about the structure and history of state power, become familiar with the work of the government and executive authorities in Ukraine. The Cabinet of Ministers plans to develop this project, attract schools, libraries, and public organizations to it, and hopes to make it one of the most popular children's Internet resources in the country</em> . <em>‚Äù</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/43b/d21/5c3/43bd215c345ad6561383f78c991d5a8e.png" width="320" height="176" hspace="10" vspace="10">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Judging by the announcement, everything is fine, finally a project without a disgruntled policy, a project for our future - our children.  And so, the 27th came and the site opened, as reported by the state media and to which a special press conference was held with the participation of the Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers Anatoly Tolstoukhov. <br>  Let's try not biased and objectively evaluate this creation, created with the support of the highest sovereign husbands.  It should be noted that, as stated, the site was developed in partnership with the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine, the State Library of Ukraine for Young People, the Association of Directors of Secondary Schools of Ukraine, the editors of the children's educational journal Vulik.  So many helpers in the development - so the site has been created excellent!? <br><br>  <strong>The question of no alternative need for children to contemplate on the site, which, we recall, according to officials, should be one of the most popular children's Internet resources of the country, the photo is rather odious politician, apparently is rhetorical.</strong> <br><br>  Well, let's start, type in the address bar of our Internet browser declared address <a href="http://children.kmu.gov.ua/">children.kmu.gov.ua</a> - hurray! Here we are on the main page of the site.  But what is it, some of the users immediately become frustrated, the header of the site looks looked down and the animated pictures do not work!  What?  It turns out that the creators of the site, for some reason, did not take into account the existence of other Internet browsers besides Microsoft Internet Explorer, the site simply does not work correctly in Opera and Mozilla Firefox, let alone Safari. <br>  What to do, open the "abandoned on the back of the hard drive," Internet Explorer, the main page of the site looks more or less presentable. <br><br>  So, we have the opportunity to click on four interactive elements: the ‚Äúheader‚Äù of the site with a stylized image of Kiev, a picture of four children (I must say not neatly drawn), a learned cat in a cap, and also jumping letters in which, with some difficulty, perhaps find out the inscription "KABMIN". <br>  Strangely enough, when you click on any of these interactive elements, we get to the page with a greeting from Prime Minister of Ukraine V.F. Yanukovych and his smiling photo.  A reasonable question arises: why was it necessary to make four interactive elements, if they all lead to the same material?  The question of no alternative need for children to contemplate on the site, which, we recall, according to officials, should be one of the most popular children's Internet resources of the country, the photo is rather odious politician, apparently is rhetorical.  I wonder how quickly the card will change on the site in case of a change in the Prime Minister of Ukraine. <br>  <strong>Surely every child dreams of knowing where and when the Minister of Finance was born, or that the Minister of Foreign Affairs was the first deputy head of the Odessa Regional State Administration.</strong> <br><br>  Well, we will consider it not so important trifle.  Surely the site should have plenty of interesting information, various games and animated videos for Ukrainian children.  I would like to, but ... <br>  The site has seven sections.  We go to the first section called " <em>About Vlad</em> ", it contains only a dry description of the branches of the Ukrainian government - it is unlikely that it will interest children. <br><br>  Go ahead, the second section, " <em>My Order</em> ", this section is even more "interesting" for children, because here it is possible to read the biographies of all Ukrainian ministers.  Surely every child dreams of knowing where and when the Minister of Finance was born, or that the Minister of Foreign Affairs was the first deputy head of the Odessa Regional State Administration. <br><br>  The third section, ‚ÄúThe <strong>History of the State of Vladyka,</strong> ‚Äù is a brief Ukrainian history, submitted according to the stages of statehood development, while the historical data presented in the section are very controversial.  For example, the first section of our history is called ‚ÄúAntska Power‚Äù, in the section it is said that Kievan Rus originated on the basis of the Antsky state - a very, very controversial statement. <br>  But we again got carried away, leave the debate about history to historians and move on to the fourth section, because it promises to be interesting! <br>  The section is called ‚Äú <strong>Excursion of the weekday</strong> ‚Äù; in fact, it‚Äôs interesting for children to see what and how they have in the Ministerial House. <br>  It should be said that this section, unlike the entire site, is drawn at a fairly high level, but the fact is that, apparently, the section was originally not a section of the site, but a printed booklet for children.  The booklet was not bad, but that's not the problem, transferring it to an electronic form and putting it on the site, someone forgot about the proportions and sizes.  As a result, the text looks very small and practically non-readable. <br><br>  <strong>True, on closer examination, it turns out that there are only three games in the section, and there are no contests at all.</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br><br>  Again we follow further, the fifth section, entitled ‚Äú <strong>My Ukraine</strong> ‚Äù, is a map of Ukraine drawn for children.  The map seems to be done well, but, first, the picture opens in low resolution, which makes it look blurry, and secondly, the map becomes interactive only when you switch to the additional submenu ‚Äúetnographic mapa‚Äù (by the way, the words ‚Äúmap "And" map ", decide how correct it is, officials), it is difficult for children, isn‚Äôt it? <br><br>  In the sixth section, ‚ÄúSchool of Community Studies,‚Äù the developers had enough strength only to compile two ‚Äúlessons‚Äù (essentially just a text, without any interactive possibilities), well, thanks to that, say, they are busy officials, you see a year later a couple of lessons will be offered to the children. <br>  And finally, the seventh section!  Rejoice, children, this is exactly what you were waiting for, the section is called ‚Äú–Ü ta competition‚Äù.  True, on closer examination, it turns out that there are only three games in the section, and there are no contests at all.  The first game is a declared puzzle, pieces of which serve the regions of Ukraine, drawn rather clumsily and roughly. <br>  The second game, ‚ÄúHoly Tree‚Äù, is not much better, it is necessary to click on the pre-selected colors in it to color the picture, strangely, the developers have never stated that the site is positioned as a page for children under 3 years old.  And finally, the last ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù is the game ‚ÄúZahovane for points‚Äù, if the previous game was for children under 3 years old, then this is probably for children under one year old, because nothing is needed in it except to click the mouse anywhere on the screen. <br>  Also on the site there is an "extensive" dictionary of 10 concepts and search, everything, more children here have nothing to count on.  And this is a site that should become one of the best Ukrainian children's resources ?! <br>  <strong>Yes, this multimedia portal would not deserve even fours if a student from any reputable university for information technology had made it.</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br><br>  What we have in the end is a page with a bad layout, with almost no animation, with poorly thought-out navigation (for example, there is a return to the main page button on all opened pages) and almost useless content.  Also, there are three primitive games and there is no hint of interactive communication between children. <br>  And this is the project that was loudly announced by the officials, the project which was supervised by the sovereign men ?!  Yes, this multimedia portal would not deserve even fours if a student from any reputable university for information technology had made it.  I would like to ask our officials how much the development of this creation cost?  What was the role of the Cabinet of Ministers, as well as the support of the substantial state institutions indicated at the beginning of the article in the development of the site?  And finally, on what basis were the site developers chosen? <br><br>  The Ukrainian Internet is the electronic one, part of Ukraine which, thanks to the efforts of enthusiasts, can bring us closer to European standards and give a further impetus to the development of the country. <br>  The state, albeit childish, website performed at such a low technical, artistic and informational level is a shame for Ukrainian politicians, a shame for the state.  But politicians, apparently, do not care, the site is made just for show, besides, this is another wonderful opportunity to tell on TV about their successes "Here, look how good we are, even a wonderful site for children did," and of course someone else put some more state money into his pocket, because, as we know, websites commissioned by the government are not made for pennies. <br><br>  PS: So that the critic did not look unfounded, go to the children's portal of the Moscow government <a href="http://deti.mos.ru/">deti.mos.ru</a> and compare. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15074/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15074/</a></p>
