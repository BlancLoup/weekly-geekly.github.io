  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to sell a dream</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Nowadays, the whole world has gone astray in marketing, and I, as a representative of this ancient profession, are of course pleased.  Every day there are more and more theories about how to sell your product or service more efficiently.  In the modern world there is a unique situation when product advertising often has more value for consumers than the product itself. <br><br>  This does not mean that the consumer is stupidly stupid, but you cannot call a stupid person paying for a theater ticket, because he also pays for words, but words that have become art.  If marketing is an art, then you need to understand its laws. <br><br>  Let's try to make out an example of a well-known company Nike, which sells sportswear not only for athletes, but also for ordinary people.  The slogan of this company is ‚Äújust do it‚Äù, which is translated into Russian ‚ÄúJust do it‚Äù - three words that bring millions.  Let's see why.

But, as we all know, not all people who want to look good are involved in sports - there are a lot of reasons for this, but even fewer people are willing to consciously tell themselves that they will never look like that guy or girl from the cover because they are just lousy lazy and do not want to raise their fat ass from the chair right now and do a couple of exercises.  There is a contradiction, an internal conflict between the size of the ass and the unwillingness to change anything, this conflict gives rise to uncertainty in one‚Äôs own powers, and uncertainty in turn gives rise to the need to justify one‚Äôs inaction.  Here is a man crushed by his insignificance, by name, for example, Ivan, devouring a sandwich with lard rummaging around the Internet and sees an ad for Nike and this ad says ‚ÄúJust do it‚Äù and shows beautiful, like ancient gods, people who live an active interesting life they have everything Ivan dreams about.  Nike marketers give him a unique opportunity to look at the world through their eyes for a couple of minutes, to present themselves as one of these people.  You just see how great they are doing it - whoever says that this is not art - let them throw a stool at me. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BpEX3f3vvWI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgHkSySgIWWK1PB_YESRoA45aTRoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  These guys believe that I will do it, yes!  I have to do it!  You only need to buy sneakers from them and immediately to the gym!  So what happened?  In fact, a person bought a non-specific product, believe me, he almost certainly doesn‚Äôt care about their clothes, he bought a dream and became a little bit happier for the next couple of weeks.  The consumer, for the most part, wants peace, his mind is asleep and wants to see beautiful dreams, and the dream of the mind, as they say, gives rise to monsters.  Well, dear marketers, we are those monsters that our sleepy clients spawned and our main task is to create new dreams for consumers so that they sleep peacefully and in their sleep unknowingly eat all that crap we give them . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/752/513/478/752513478f465debf61c2f69a5932ec0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, let's try to understand how to create such dreams. <br>  To finally descend from heaven to earth, imagine that a certain company from the city of Saratov asked us to advertise the most banal of things - plastic windows of our own production.  And for starters, like everywhere and always, we need to do research. <br><br><h3>  Consumer Research </h3><br><br>  We begin to study the market, and we understand that plastic windows are a fairly common thing and they are bought by completely different people and organizations.  Suppose that after conducting standard research, we found the part of the market with the highest demand and the least supply, and suppose that after the classic marketing manipulations, we realized that our customers are owners of hrushchev in the city of Saratov, in average age from 30 to 45 most of the 70 percent are employees and at least 30 percent are workers, with an average salary of 35 to 55 thousand per family per month, 60 percent of them are family, and 20 percent are divorced and 20 are single, well, a few more metrics in the same spirit which allow  sketch a rough portrait of the consumer. <br><br>  Suppose that from our manipulations it turned out that the most suitable for us subspecies are family owners of Khrushchev, 35-40 years old on average, having one, maximum two children, with a salary of 40 thousand per family. <br><br>  We have decently narrowed the search for the ideal client and now comes the most important thing, without which all previous work may be useless - the creation of advertising-sleep.  We need to create a ‚ÄúDream Card‚Äù, for this we will have to dig a lot in dirty underwear and social networks :) Social networks are a great tool for studying bipeds, people there talk about not even telling their friends while drunk. <br><br>  We find 20-30 families that fit the parameters, and begin our excavations.  Everything is interesting: how old the children are, how many years have they been married, what price category does the car have, is there a summer house, when they last rested, social circle, physical health, naked women, their husbands tusky and so on.  We need to pull out from the social networks all that they can give us, then write down everything found in the tablet and find matches.  You should get at least 7-8 matches, of which you can build somewhere between 10 and 15 hypotheses about what their main dreams are and 10-15 what their fears are.  As a rule, one is a reflection of the other, but not always.  We put these hypotheses in the table and go to the other 20 families, preferably ourselves, preferably with our feet and ask them to evaluate the degree of dreams and fear on a scale from one to ten.  By the way, the most interesting thing always appears during communication, be sure to write it down and then add to the hypotheses and more, if any questions are too intimate - look for workarounds for finding the right answer, in general - improvise.  We reject all the hypotheses that have scored less than 6 balls and we still have about 4-5 dreams and as many fears with an average score from 6 to 10. <br><br>  If you have not received any objective result, then you have to start all over again.  If everything worked out for us, now we know the first part of the information we need. <br><br>  The second part concerns the inner human and family culture, and is no less important for us, but as a rule, the work here is very individual and requires personal contact, we need it in order to learn to speak the language of the consumer and learn the decision-making mechanism in such families. <br>  So, suppose all this work is done and we have the knowledge we need. <br>  It's time to create dreams. <br><br><h3>  Create dreams </h3><br><br>  Dreams are of two types - sweet dreams based on dreams and fearful dreams based on fears. <br>  We studied the decision-making mechanism in the families of clients and decided to create dreams for women because they are the catalyst for change in our case. <br><br>  Suppose a woman of 35 years old, living in a hruschevka in Saratov, feels relentlessly going to nowhere and dreams of traveling, some kind of insane act, at the same time she wants comfort and confidence in the future, her children are always in her dreams who are happy and they have a beautiful future, healthy parents who are not afraid of old age, and of course eternal youth. <br><br>  In fact, if you conducted a study, you have much more accurate information about consumer dreams, I, for demonstration purposes, limited myself to a set of simple and too general assumptions. <br>  Also, suppose that she is afraid of growing old and becoming ugly, leaving her husband, illness of children, death of parents, ruin, etc. <br><br>  Inside each ad must be a call to action.  You can call to change your world for the better, and protect it from something bad.  The main thing - no need to lie, the consumer is not a fool and hardly believe that if he buys our windows - his children will have a good future.  The call should be clear from our advertising and have independent value, the product should go like an additional purchase. <br><br>  Let's try to play with dreams and plastic windows :) I will try, for you, to quickly sketch 2 concepts of dreams for dreams and one for fears. <br><br><h4>  Dream: Comfort and confidence in the future. </h4><br>  What is the comfort associated with our customers.  Well, suppose, with fire, house, warm rug. <br><br><h4>  Dream first ‚ÄúLight of native windows‚Äù </h4><br><br>  Our heroine is somewhere where it is cold and the wind blows, for example, returns home in an old broken Saratov bus, pulls shopping bags and, entering into his yard, sees the warm light of his native windows.  Here she is on the threshold, the door opens, and there is a holiday, happy children and a husband with gifts and flowers.  It turns out that she has a birthday, which she herself has forgotten.  At the end of sleep, they all sit on the couch in an embrace under a warm rug, candles are burning on the cake.  We see this happy family, the camera slowly drives off and is outside the apartment, looks at them through the windows (of course, the production of our company).  We see the inscription, something like ‚ÄúYour warm world‚Äù and the signature ‚ÄúPlastic windows of Saratov.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c4/636/e8a/4c4636e8a3cb1a0ca811e37535658220.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this dream, I showed the client his dream, which, if I did the research correctly, should please him, moreover, I scored the last carnation, directly indicating this in the last sentence.  In this case, the second code, I tied his thoughts to the image of the window of production of our company.  The client ate our beautiful story and its critical consciousness did not oppose the advertising content. <br><br><h4>  The dream of change.  The second dream ‚ÄúThe wind of change outside your window‚Äù </h4><br><br>  Let's create a feeling of stuffiness in the house, for example, in the kitchen, the soup is brewed, spewing clubs of a couple, children scream, strange guests in the apartment, something vividly discussing, on the forehead at the loudest speaker perspiration, the phone constantly rings, this is all aggravated by the small entourage Khruschevs, it's dirty there, sovdepovskie carpets on the walls, shabby yellow wallpaper, in general, a real stuffy hell.  The owner of the apartment, dumbfounded by all this, opens the window and freezes in surprise, the wind blows in her face, her hair flutters and for some reason the cries of gulls are heard.  Seeing her numbness, the other inhabitants of the apartment approach the window and also look out in surprise.  The camera pulls away and we see that the Khrushchev five-story building in which they live is in the middle of an incredibly beautiful tropical island.  We see the inscription ‚ÄúThe whole world outside your window‚Äù and the signature ‚ÄúPlastic windows of Saratov.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52c/a4f/fc5/52ca4ffc5b6c2b348a76aa4989df77a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is the same story as with the last dream - I try to attach our advertising message to the client's dream of change. <br><br>  Now we will try to create a nightmare, with nightmares you need to be very careful, if you overdo it a little - the client will wake up and then you will not sell him anything except your scalp.  Do not forget to end every nightmare with something positive, unless of course you are doing hardcore social programs. <br><br><h4>  Fear of family split.  The third dream ‚ÄúDo not let the world collapse‚Äù </h4><br><br>  Frame-prehistory, the worker puts a wooden window in the apartment, checks how the door opens. <br>  Frame one.  The girl opens this window and alone looks at the dawn, dreams about something. <br>  Frame two.  The guy under the window of the girl with flowers is trying to throw a snowball at her window, gets hit a couple of times, she suddenly opens the window and the snowball flies right in her face, she laughs. <br>  Frame three.  Together they stand near the window and look at the sunrise covered by a blanket. <br>  Frame four.  She is sitting near the window with a small child, waiting for his return home from work. <br>  Frame five.  They swear at the window, she throws out his favorite thing in the window. <br>  Frame six.  Night, he sits on a bench near the house, looks at the burning window of their apartment, then rises and leaves at night. <br>  The seventh frame.  She sits by the window alone and looks out on a dreary autumn day.  It should be clear that the separation has occurred, she is noticing the advertising banner of the company ‚ÄúPlastic windows of Saratov‚Äù outside the window. <br>  Frame-looping.  The worker puts a new window, checks how the door opens. <br>  The camera pulls out of the window and we see a boy and a girl sitting in an embrace on a bench, their child runs around the yard gaily.  We see the inscription - ‚ÄúChanges start small‚Äù and the signature - ‚ÄúPlastic windows of Saratov‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c65/6e0/7bc/c656e07bc0a038b0be0a81f343b4fca3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this dream, I tried to convey to the client the idea that if he didn‚Äôt change anything right now, his family could fall apart, and once again be attached to the damn Saratov windows. <br><br>  It is worth noting that such advertising works well for long distances, there may not be instant explosive sales from it, unless of course it does not become viral, but it has the property to eats up perfectly in the brain and when the client is ripe for purchase, he is much more likely to all Saratov companies producing windows will choose ours. <br><br>  I am by no means saying that what I have described is the best way to advertise anything, but you must admit that it is at least interesting. <br><br>  <i>Best regards, <a href="http://generate.club/">Generate.club</a> project team.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362473/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362473/</a></p>
