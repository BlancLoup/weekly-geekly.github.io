The Ministry of Defense was the first to publicly disgrace, which, as the site of the Roskomnadzor was <a href="http://b0ltai.org/2015/08/07/%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D1%258E-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5/">excavated, the</a> guys from the Anonymous International, do not hesitate to send documentation about our menacing Iskander and nuclear submarines through public mail servers.  To do this, however, according to the hackers, they had to hack those same mailboxes on yandex.ru, mail.ru, gmail.com (and also iPhone and iPad) and post excerpts from the correspondence in public so that the ministry could not ignore. <br>  The merry fellows from ‚ÄúHumpty‚Äù issued their publication in the form of an open letter to the Department of Military Counterintelligence of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  To the Department of Military Counterintelligence of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation <br>  Colonel-General Alexander G. Bezverkhniy <br>  from team Anonymous Internationale (b0ltai.org) <br><br>  Dear Alexander Georgievich! <br>  You are drawn to the team Anonymous Internationale. <br>  Some time ago we had access to the postal array and devices of Ksenia Bolshakova, assistant and secretary of Mr. Filimonov, former head of the Department of Construction of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.  Currently, this information array is being sold on the Information Exchange at <a href="https://joker.buzz/item/23">joker.buzz/item/23</a> <br>  After a careful study of the array, we regretted the complete incompetence of employees of several departments of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation in the field of information security, and more specifically, in criminal negligence.  Free mail services such as yandex.ru, mail.ru and American gmail.com transmitted unencrypted official documents, often representing secret information related to the defense capability of the Russian Federation.  In particular, in this way reports and information were transmitted on issues discussed at meetings with the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation and his deputies.  The information passed through unprotected e-mail channels in open form, easily accessible to most of the interested parties.  Also, employees of Mr. Filimonov and related persons transmitted secret information on Apple devices.  In addition, passwords and access to the service mail servers of the Ministry of Defense appeared in the recordings of the filimonova secretary Kseniya Bolshakova's devices. <br>  With sadness, we note that if this information became available to us, it is more likely that it could be available to the special services of a number of interested countries, since the criminal negligence of employees of the Department of Construction of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation provided ample opportunities for this during 2012-2014. <br>  We ask you, dear Alexander Georgievich, to pay attention to such a scornful attitude to the information security of former and current employees of the structures of the Ministry of Defense.  If necessary, we can provide additional information about these persons. <br>  Accompanied to this letter, we upload a file about military units with the deployment of the Iskander complexes, as well as a part of the retouched file at the fourth-generation submarine base sites at 12 sites. <br>  We would also like to note that the massif of Mr. Filimonov being sold on the Information Exchange may be sold to employees of the military counterintelligence with a 50% discount.  Subject to verification of these employees. <br><br>  Sincerely, Anonymous Internationale. </blockquote><br>  This archive <a href="https://joker.buzz/item/23">is sold</a> on the ‚ÄúExchange of Information‚Äù for 350 Bitcoins, which is currently approximately equal to 6 million rubles.

      Presidential spokesman Peskov has already <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/458878">commented on the</a> news to Interfax: <br><blockquote>  The use of free mail services for business purposes in the present conditions is not a very good solution, and to transfer some information for official use or, all the more secret, is beyond the limits of insanity and absolutely unacceptable. </blockquote>  And here's another, about the protection of state secrets, very convincingly: <br><blockquote>  As for the stated facts, I am sure that, since there are services that are engaged in protecting state secrets, these services do their job quite clearly. </blockquote><br>  And indeed, they ‚Äúclearly do‚Äù, there is no finger on the piece of paper - not a state secret, we rest!  And where to put it there, etozh "VORD"! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45c/d65/b7e/45cd65b7e829b3d38eefa15f781897b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ff/b37/555/0ffb37555a2147aab57c40b50afaabc7.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/205/0ef/5cd/2050ef5cdc7ca204a710e5bcaa8b1e33.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/696/de3/575/696de3575c8217cf4092ec82a803328b.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264405/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264405/</a></p>
