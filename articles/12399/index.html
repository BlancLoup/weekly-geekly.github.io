  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Web Applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As many already know (and who do not know, now they will find out), for a long time I didn‚Äôt like various web applications that were originally on the desktop (for example, an email client).  Now there are some circumstances, because of which I have to change my opinion ... <br><br>  First of all, let's talk about such simple applications (as compared to subsequent ones, of course), like the email client and rss reader, namely, <a href="http://gmail.com/">Gmail</a> and <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> .  For a start - that encouraged me to use them.  There were 2 big reasons for this: <br><ol><li>  Because  I have repairs at home (and I was leaving for the sea) - I constantly had to use various computers for work / surfing on an Internet, etc. </li><li>  My global transition to linux (more precisely, half global, on the second computer is whist), in connection with which I <a href="http://blog.fxposter.org/2007/06/24/mozilla-backup-for-linux/">could not transfer the</a> saved info from my thunderbird in Windows to thunderbird in Linux. </li></ol><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Because of these two reasons for mine, I decided to use Gmail's web interface as an email client until I found a way to recover the backed-up data.  and you know what?  It turned out to be very convenient, besides, by default (if someone is not up to date) letters are not deleted, but are added to the archive, so problem No. 2 was solved (there was no need to restore anything, everything was in place).  In general, I am not particularly picky about the mail client - the main thing is that there were 3 things there: the ability to view incoming and outgoing messages, a normal search was implemented and it would be possible to compose letters conveniently.  Gmail's interface provided me all this with a bang, it is especially interesting to compare the search implementation by message.  To the one who did not use the thunderbird, I will say - the search turns into a wild horror when the number of letters becomes large enough.  He searches for suitable letters for a very long time and at the same time the computer slows down to horror.  I kind of came to terms with such a turn of events for a long time, until ... until I started Gmail - the search works instantly and does not slow anything down. <br><br>  Of course, if you have the bat installed, yes, or the same thunderbird with a bunch of plugins, and you use all these plugins and cannot live without them - then the Gmail web interface is hardly suitable for you, but for those who still have it since Outlook Express or something else, but just because you love opensource (you don‚Äôt like microsoft, you like your email client‚Äôs logo, you‚Äôve got something installed and learned to use, you <em>need to underline</em> ), then Gmail‚Äôs web interface is what you need (well, or at least I highly recommend you to try it :)).

      Yes, by the way, today I installed <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/mobile/mail/index.html">Gmail</a> on my E61 <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/mobile/mail/index.html">java-applet</a> , which is something like ... Let's just say that the application looks like <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/mobile/mail/index.html">Gmail</a> 's web interface, if you access it from a mobile phone via the built-in phone browser, but it‚Äôs sharpened on Gmail + is much more convenient than to climb the site from the phone. <br><br>  Next, on Google Reader.  Let's start with the fact that for me in the rss-reader it‚Äôs important one thing - how convenient the window will be to display the messages themselves.  In Google Reader, viewing messages is implemented as a separate frame (honestly, I did not look at the code, but it looks like a frame), in which the Ajax will load messages from the selected feed + old messages will be loaded when you scroll down.  Settings - at least, but the convenience of the height.  I would also like to note one very interesting fact, which encouraged me to switch from a desktop reader to an online one: Google Reader downloads new messages from feeds not at the moment you open it, but on your own, even if you close the browser.  What is the advantage?  The fact that in the rss-channels are usually stored only the latest messages, and not all, and there are a certain number, regardless of the time of your last call.  Those.  if you subscribe to a feed in which new messages appear quite often, and for some time did not download new messages from there, then, unfortunately, when you download a feed, you will receive only the last N messages, and all messages that were before them (but which appeared <strong>after the</strong> last viewing of the feed), they will be irretrievably lost for you (lost - in the rss-feed, on the site itself you can still watch them, but this is not about that now).  When using Google Reader, you are spared from these problems - he will upload new messages to the server himself, and you, returning, for example, a week later, after a sea holiday, will be able to read <strong>all the</strong> messages that were written in the feeds you read. <br><br>  I can say very little about the rest of the programs that have switched (obviously) from the desktop to the online.  I didn‚Äôt use <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> specifically, only opened documents in it a couple of times.  I can see that ‚ÄúGoogle Word‚Äù ‚Äúeats‚Äù quite a large part of the formatting from the original document, which is not encouraging, but there are no special reasons for excitement - I am sure that the work is underway, and it‚Äôs already quite suitable for editing quite complex things.  I have never used the analogs of Excel and Powerpoint yet (and thank goodness I don‚Äôt like paperwork).  I would also like to mention the online-options of the icq-client, which, as far as I know, are already quite a few.  I myself tried to use <a href="http://wwwm.meebo.com/">Meebo</a> , but unfortunately, he is not very friendly with Asya, or rather not very friendly with the cp1251 encoding, which is still used in the Russian-speaking segment in most clients (it uses, as I understand it, UTF-8 , changing the encoding of the browser for some reason did not save :(). <br><br>  ¬© <a href="http://blog.fxposter.org/">FX's blog</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12399/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12399/</a></p>
