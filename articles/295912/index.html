      However, now some streaming services are trying to turn the tide. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Google on October 27 <a href="http://recode.net/2015/10/27/google-brings-podcasting-to-play-music-swinging-at-apples-dominance/">announced</a> support for podcasts, which after some time will appear in the music service Google Play <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Music">Music</a> .  At the moment, this section of the service is just beginning to be filled and is not yet available to listeners. <br><br>  Google has agreed to cooperate with more than a dozen popular podcasters and show providers.  Podcasters from the United States have already had the opportunity to download their own podcasts via the link <a href="https://play.google.com/music/podcasts/publish%3Fu%3D0">play.google.com/music/podcasts/publish</a> . <br><br>  The exact date of launching the podcast section for ordinary listeners has not yet been announced.  But the company promises to provide additional details in the "coming months."  Google‚Äôs ambitions, as always, are great - the company has clearly made it clear that it will fight Apple for its user audience. <br><br>  Another streaming service, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deezer">Deezer</a> , made a serious step towards podcasting back in 2014.  He then acquired <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a> , a company that provides radio podcasts.  Since then, the number of Deezer podcasts has increased to 20,000. And last Thursday, October 29, 2015, service representatives <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/10/29/deezer-takes-the-fight-to-google-play-music-with-20000-new-podcasts-and-offline-playback/">said</a> that Deezer had 20,000 more podcasts. <br><br>  The service operates in more than 180 countries and offers podcasts in different languages.  Deezer has podcast broadcasts with NPR, Financial Times, Panoply, WNYC, This American Life and CBS Radio News.  Now you will add talkSPORT, Bayerischer Rundfunk, France 24 and Braincast to the list of partners.  The service is launched in five new markets - in Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Spain and Colombia. <br><br>  Yesterday, October 30, Deezer was supposed to begin a public offering on the Paris Euronext.  But three days before the deadline, the company <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/28/deezer-ipo-music-streaming">abandoned</a> its intentions. <br><br>  Earlier, on October 15, Deezer confirmed that he intends to go IPO.  The company's management planned to sell over 8 million shares.  It was assumed that with the help of IPO Deezer will be able to earn about 330-414 million dollars.  The company planned an IPO, despite the large financial losses, which over the past 3.5 years amounted to 87 million euros. <br><br>  According to a company representative, the refusal to enter the stock exchange is still associated with difficult ‚Äúmarket conditions‚Äù.  But by refusing an IPO, Deezer continues to grow in line with its strategy, he added. <br><br>  Unfortunately, Deezer does not reveal the details of the strategy and does not explain how the service will reduce its losses.  It is also not reported how Deezer will fight for its audience with competitors, whether it will win the audience from Apple. <br><br>  However, how Google will win it is also not yet known. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295912/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295912/</a></p>
