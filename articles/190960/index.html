  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The state in which I would like to live</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h6>  One thing is not clear - why people who want to move somewhere, do not want to organize here (where they live) everything so that they feel comfortable?  Without any agics for any decisions, I will try to offer, as it seems to me, a convenient scheme of peaceful coexistence with the existing system of values, morals and life arrangement, in the Russian Federation. <br><br>  Coexistence is a bad word ... try to replace it.  Coexistence is what happens to us here and now, and if you make an attempt to move out of coexistence, in cohabitation, at least trying, will lose nothing.  In any case, if they lose, then definitely less than when trying to escape somewhere to live, on an uninhabited island. </h6><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  CrowdFunding </h5><br>  As we know, there is already a decentralized currency in the world, which allows thinking people to maintain anonymity sufficiently (being online) and to be able to acquire material values ‚Äã‚Äãwithout revealing their identity.  What prevents, for example, those who propose to create their own island of stability and security to use this currency to implement their political initiatives in the framework of the country in which you live? <br><br>  Using such a tool as the main means of mutual settlements, you, thus, slightly block the financing of the existing regime.  Using it more and more often, and (probably anonymously) attracting more and more supporters to your ranks to use it, thus blocking it even more.

    <h4>  Control restriction </h4><br>  What is needed for genuine and true freedom of speech, and freedom of dissemination of information in our society? <br>  That's right - to encrypt not only passwords, but also messages that you transmit on social networks, by phone, through photos, and other communication channels. <br><br>  Those.  - quietly, for political decision makers in our country.  To do this, it is enough to create a distributed social network (this can be done on the basis of the already existing <a href="https://github.com/oakes/Nightweb">Nightweb</a> project), and for all political initiatives that would allow to bypass some laws that we don‚Äôt like, communicate only through these communication channels.  Also use them for projects that are capable of generating cash flow to develop the system. <br><br>  It is also realistic to organize something like SilkRoad - this is me now not about forbidden islands, but about the general consumption of any arbitrary goods, with the very purpose of limiting the budget and, accordingly, the means for manipulating society, in our state. <br><br>  And not only ours - these are global problems, IMHO ... without this paradigm (which I am trying to describe here so that you yourself began to draw it in your head), all have plus or minus the same - every nation is dissatisfied with something. <br><br>  How can the state influence us if it is not able to predict and predict our current moods? <br><br><h4>  Questions on the implementation plan </h4><br>  What system of political order do you consider most acceptable? <br>  Decisions on which life issues we want to take, from the state, to ourselves? <br>  Which authorities will make these decisions and for which of the classes of issues in these areas? <br>  As in such a system, where no one knows anyone, to organize fair elections to the appropriate authorities, <br>  despite the fact that the state has clearly more resources than us, and its agents there <br>  (almost any state) can run in excess to <br>  voted in favor of their decisions? <br><br><h6>  Well, in general, that's all. <br><br>  Next is your questions and reasoning.  It's curious if anyone thought the same <br>  and whether the idea has the right to life, or even <br>  - to be voiced. <br><br>  UPD: to avoid attacks on the fact that it is difficult and almost impossible <br>  - basically this is the answer to the topic in which people offered <br>  buy an island and go live there. <br></h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190960/</a></p>
