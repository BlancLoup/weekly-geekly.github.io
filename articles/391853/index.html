  <section class="page js-page"><h1>2 years - normal flight</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When Gearbest was just preparing for the launch, the existing Chinese retailers confidently captured the world and conquered the hearts and wallets of Russian consumers.  In accordance with all the laws of <s>physics of</s> economics, it is difficult to enter a competitive market.  And we were also scared! <br>  Today Gearbest is 2 years old - for a store it is already a mature age.  By our two-year anniversary, we tried everything: huge sales, flash-actions, exclusive novelties of the market, and, of course, problems with payments and delivery.  Alas, while no store could not avoid them.  For our team, these 24 months were not progressive development - we ran a giant and very difficult marathon.  Resting did not work - run on!  And while you read the fun potpourri of facts, discounts and, as always, interesting gadgets.  Let's go party! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/703/2a5/0f6/7032a50f667447d68854605de248a4b8.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Seven facts about GearBest </h2><br>  <b>Fact 1.</b> Gearbest initially relied on gadgets and technologies - our store often finds the lowest prices for smartphones, quadcopters, action cameras, smart watches, fitness bracelets, and so on.  But what to say, even Raspberry Pi and Arduino, we do not bypass.  We are always primarily focused on low prices for gadgets and devices. <br><br>  <b>Fact 2.</b> On the Gearbest pages you can find your own videos and videos of users, in which not only the product is viewed, but also used in the most combat conditions. <br><br>  <b>Fact 3.</b> Like our competitors, Gearbest has a very bad Russian translation, and this constantly causes jokes and discussions.  In fact, there is no translation as such - you can see that the choice of language in the top panel is available through the Google Translate interface.  If you translate everything with the help of a professional, it is very expensive and time consuming - our users simply will not have time to find out about new products, and prices will quietly absorb the share of translation costs.  As for the automatic translation into / from Chinese, its level still leaves much to be desired - only two top online tools do relatively well.  However, our English-language interface is familiar to almost all online shopping lovers.

      But we have good news - very soon our store will delight everyone with the Russian-language version of the site.  Menus and newsletters will be in good Russian (subscribe to rate, praise, criticize), but with the description of the goods we will be assisted by automatic translators. <br><br>  <b>Fact 4.</b> Chinese online stores are very fond of landings - they prepare them for new products, sales, product groups.  Contrary to judgment, this is not a blind copying of Western templates - Landings are comfortable, beautiful, better translated and actually work.  And on the holiday landing pages on the right, we highlight sections, into which ideas for gifts and purchases are grouped - you can immediately go to an interesting block. <br>  For example, we made one for our <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-222.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">birthday</a> , and we <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-crazy-shopping-carnival-collec-special-274.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">dedicated one to electronic cigarettes</a> (by the way, <b>Fact 4.1</b> - the Gearbest team does not smoke and does not advise you). <br><br>  In general, we love interesting events connected with various spheres: traditions, art, mass culture.  For example, we have a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-star-wars-toys-special-340.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">special page dedicated to Star Wars</a> - we ourselves are fans of the epic saga.  On the page - continuous fan fetishism: <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/other-classic-toys/pp_272232.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">lightsabers</a> , <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/block-toys/pp_321182.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">R2D2</a> , <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-robot/pp_322053.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">BB-8</a> and <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-robot/pp_322053.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Master Yoda</a> in the range. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b9/54d/359/7b954d359e5d446faf639e65e71feb21.png"><br><br>  <b>Fact 5.</b> Gearbest loves sales.  These are traditional sales of Black Friday, Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday, New Year's Day and discounts for national holidays.  So, in 2015, we joined the 11.11 event, timed to coincide with the Chinese Bachelor's Day, which became the efforts of our senior colleague as an international shopping day.  We love holidays of all cultures, so sales are held on Christmas, February 23 and even <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-vs-1-special-467.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Easter and May 1</a> (although it is an international holiday, we took into account the Russian flavor).  Moreover, sales for us is not only a reason to increase the volume of trade, but also respect for the traditions of other cultures. <br><br>  <b>Fact 6.</b> We love PayPal and accept payments by Visa, MasterCard, bank transfer, Webmoney, Qiwi and others. PayPal gives buyers reliable protection and in case of an error or violation of the rules by the seller you can return the money or part of them relatively easily.  We have free international shipping, including Russian Post. <br><br>  <b>Fact 7.</b> We choose, we choose.  Deals (great deals), Presale (pre-order the latest gadgets and devices at a favorable pre-sale price), New (new items and new arrivals), Top Brands (popular and favorite brands), Gifts (gift ideas with free shipping) are available in the top panel menu. ) and Cool (our favorite section, here we load the products chosen by our team: from <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_227132.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">cool tablets</a> to funny and fun trinkets like a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/home-gadgets/pp_17639.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">faucet for Coke</a> ).  Sometimes we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/271642/">cover new items</a> and make holiday selections for Geektimes - we try with humor and use. <br><br>  And we also have coupons with which the purchase price is even lower :-) For example, such. <br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_268672.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Tablet XiaoMi Mi Pad 2 Windows 10 Version</a> with a 7.9-inch Retina display, 8 megapixel camera, 2 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal memory.  With the <b>MIPADRU</b> coupon <b>, the</b> gadget will cost <b>$ 239.89.</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0a/9f5/6c5/c0a9f56c5e5d458d9c660b6d8e312dc6.jpg"></div><br>  Or such for his more modest fellows: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_298397.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Teclast X80 Plus</a> with coupon <b>X80PGB</b> price $ 86.99 <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_263284.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Onda V919 Air 64GB ROM Tablet PC</a> with coupon <b>V919GHK</b> price $ 154.99 <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_298398.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Cube iwork8 Ultimate Tablet PC</a> Coupon <b>IW8UTI</b> Price $ 90.79 <br></li></ul><br><h2>  How will you celebrate? </h2><br>  As always - gifts for our customers.  We have prepared discounts for our biennium and another small surprise.  We were constantly scolded for discounts, which begin quite shortly before the holiday.  In general, corrected.  Already started the sale of goods, timed to May 1.  And this is not a strange reason.  We know that almost all of Russia on the May holidays is sent to the first picnics, fishing, to the forest, to the country, out of town.  Tired of a long overcast winter, people enjoy the sun, spring air, warmth, and the most desperate open the swimming season.  For a civilized person, going to nature is always a little stress, and we set ourselves the task of <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-vs-1-special-467.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">offering goods</a> that will facilitate the ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù life of holidaymakers. <br><br>  The more active the rest, the worse the gadgets feel: they sink, beat, get lost, become clogged with dust and sand, die in the back pocket.  It is difficult for a modern person to do without a smartphone (weather, maps, navigator, book for the evening, mail), so for rest it is better to have an inexpensive but functional device, preferably with a good battery.  This is possible, for example, with <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_282873.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">CUBOT NOTE S 3G Phablet</a> , the 5.5-inch display is suitable for both cards and reading;  Android 5.1 operating system, 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory will ensure the work of all the usual applications.  Well, the capacious 4150 mAh battery will help you not to think about the outlet every 12 hours.  Among the shortcomings - only 5 megapixel main camera and the lack of support for 4G (only 3G).  Although the cottage, the forest and the river with 4G still need to look.  In general, as a spare phone, "which is not a pity," the very thing. <br><br>  More smartphones, inexpensive and different, as well as smart watches and accessories for wearable electronics - on the next <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-smartphone-special-473.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">promotional page</a> . <br>  <i><font color="#808080">Attention!</font></i>  <i><font color="#808080">The prices are still old, they will change on the days of the promotion, but for now you have the opportunity to look at everything and choose what you need without an action hype.</font></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be6/a9c/500/be6a9c500bd0456f855952b478ecdf5a.jpg"></div><br>  At the beginning of May, the nights are still quite dark and the first brave souls who opened the tourist season are forced at night to roam about their business between tents in pitch darkness or to carry a heavy lantern.  The way out is a headlamp (conditional expression, since it comfortably sits on the whole head) a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/led-flashlights/pp_172289.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">lantern with a brightness of 5000 lumens</a> .  Hands free, brightness adjustable - friends will appreciate the man-lantern.  By the way, the device is indispensable for participants of cycling trips, which move at night and lovers of night cycling around the city - and lights up the road, and drivers noticeably. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c0/6a9/e90/7c06a9e90db745ae8196871a9cd74075.jpg"></div><br>  But <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/led-flashlights/pp_109949.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">this flashlight is</a> not so bright, but it does its job for five plus.  Its advantage is in tiny size and exceptional reliability, durability, resistance to mechanical stress and water.  By the way, look at the video page of bullying a gadget - impressive. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d7/f13/7d0/1d7f137d0ea84ce9b77ea402603d8f7b.jpg" height="400" width="400"></div><br>  Another <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/headlights/pp_139648.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">waterproof flashlight is the Skilhunt</a> with magnetic fastening to the belt and the memory function of the last setting.

For some, this phrase sounds romantic, but motorists promise solid problems.  It was during the May holidays that sleepy cars and their owners, who did not like winter driving (saving on rubber?), Were selected from thawed garages.  Risks are accumulating: drivers who have lost the winter from the helm, untested cars after hibernation, drunk and ‚Äúheavy in the morning‚Äù car owners are starting to generate emergency situations.  You need to be alert - so equip your car with a DVR in advance.  For example, <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/car-dvr/pp_268947.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi Yi 1080P</a> 60 fps with a wide viewing angle of 165 degrees and night mode.
