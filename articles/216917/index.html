The rest is downright harmful.  The best guides were intuition and craving for experiments. <br><br>  Persuasion # 1 of business literature comes down to the fact that the purpose of doing business is to generate and increase profits.  Some books so firmly adhere to this view, as if you are an idiot if you disagree with it.  I found my decisions and results more idiotic when I bought into this model. <br><br>  One of these books came to me just yesterday, someone sent it to me by mail.  Now this book is in the trash.  As a cardboard box, it will bring much more benefit than what someone reads it. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Entering the office of the company, for which profit is in the first place, you can smell oppression.  It is almost incomprehensible that human beings voluntarily accept such restriction of freedom.  I'm afraid to visit places where everyone behaves like a zombie.  The atmosphere is creepy to disgust.  Not surprisingly, drug cartels have such a thriving business.  I myself would probably take some medication every day, if I had to spend years living in a cubicle. <br><br>  Profit orientation is a great setting if you want to destroy your health, self-esteem, motivation and relationships.  I would never want to work in such a place and do not want to expose others to such conditions.  People deserve much more than to be seen as machine cogs. <br><br>  There are much more inspirational priorities for business.  Surely, you can come up with something more exciting than ‚Äúlet's make the numbers bigger than what we did last year‚Äù. <br><br>  For example, it seems more attractive to me: ‚ÄúThe goal of business is to provide people with the opportunity to express their creative potential and share it for the common good.‚Äù <br><br>  It is absurd to believe that if you do not put profit in the first place, you will not be able to organize a sustainable business.  In my experience, sustainability is much easier if you stop humiliating yourself with the position ‚Äúmoney is the main thing‚Äù. <br><br>  Instead of putting money in the first place, put creative challenges in the first place.  Put the experience first.  Pleasure.  The opportunity to work with cool people.  Your personal contribution. <br><br>  I love to run my business so much, because I don‚Äôt set money as the primary goal.  Of course, the money issue is considered, but at the very last turn of the last line, where this issue is the place. <br><br>  I have been an entrepreneur for 20 years now.  Those years, when the money took on paramount importance for me, were certainly tense and unhappy.  The years in which I brought creative expression to the first place, strengthened my connections, plunged into the pleasure of joint projects, laid out more and invested, developed, etc., became the most complete and happiest years. <br><br>  In the long run, I see that if I doomed myself to years of stress and suffering, they would eventually develop into decades of such memories, which would lead to the fact that in old age I would very much regret how I lived .  Fortunately, I was able to nip this option in the bud before I went too far along this path, so now the opposite happens.  As I get older, I become happier as I accumulate pleasant memories year after year.  Regardless of how much money I get or not get, I remember exciting projects, creative streams, close relationships, cooperation, cordial embraces of people whom I helped, and the like.  I do not remember the balance of my bank account. <br><br>  The ability to earn income from their creativity is great.  Let it be part of the task.  But do not make money the main purpose of their work.  Do not do things just for the money, because in this case you lose inspiration.  It is better to keep the path to which the soul lies, even if this leads to the fact that you will not be able to pay for housing and you will be evicted.  I say this from my own experience.  At that time, of course, it was hard, but I am even proud of this memory, and it helps me to encourage others not to accept the zombie hood. <br><br>  Follow your path, to which the soul lies, <i>especially</i> in business.  Do the real work that you think is worthy and suitable, and every year you will end up with a feeling of deep satisfaction, no matter how much money you received for it.  If you trust your intuition, act with inspiration and take time to accumulate experience and build good relationships, sooner or later you will find a way to find stability. <br>  _________________________ <br>  Steve Pavlina - a specialist in self-development and personal growth.
