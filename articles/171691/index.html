  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CeBIT 2013. Day one. Stands Thermaltake, MSI and Biostar</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Again at the beginning of spring, the CeBIT exhibition takes place in Hannover.  Time passes, big brands leave the exhibition, the number of stands of Chinese manufacturers of cases for phones is growing.  Only two things remain unchanged - German beer and German wundersch√∂ne Frauen (German beautiful women).  I will not talk at all about low-alcohol drinks at all, a separate post will be devoted to the young ladies later, but for now let's look at those industry leaders who have nevertheless brought new products to Germany. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/061/c72/aff/061c72affc854aa31ece81bf2836a21e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Thermaltake</b> <br><br>  The exhibition began with a pompous presentation of the company Thermaltake.  Together with BMW Solidworks, they developed another thing from the Level 10 line. This time, the public was presented with Level 10 M Gaming Headset gaming headsets - white and black. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a43/4f5/a31/a434f5a31a4fe4062281940b5780788f.jpg"><br>  The discovery was straightforward, with presidents, red curtains and a rag raising to the ‚ÄúThree!‚Äù Score. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a3e/a80/96a/a3ea8096ac096eaa9dba755961cd926c.jpg"><br>  The style and beauty of the headset is not in doubt - even the BMW designers would work) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b93/09c/fb5/b9309cfb50436e0e301fdec56b47b522.jpg"><br>  Sound quality, however, could not be assessed, if there is an opportunity on the next days of the exhibition - I will definitely write about it. <br>  In addition, TT eSports brought a huge multi-colored batch of mice, keyboards and mats, among which are the solutions under the brand ‚ÄúWhite-Ra Special Tactics‚Äù.  Glossy white and yellow mice are targeted at specific buyers, but the combination of khaki and black will surely be popular. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a9f/7c4/1a4/a9f7c41a408ef9d1f775606f67630770.jpg"><br>  Mono-color (almost) and mono-brand (almost) solution from Thermaltake.  It looks cool, your humble author has a similar color in his desktop, but from other components. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b26/651/1a1/b266511a152909f37d01810194a35fd3.jpg"><br>  A new series of power supplies from Thermaltake was named after the German cities.  Frankly, I would also indicate Wolfsburg and Ingolstadt - cities where they know a lot about high-quality hardware =) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1f/cce/cd6/b1fccecd6545e149bdebd28cb24d2083.jpg"><br>  Of the new cooling systems, the air cooling systems Nic F3 and Nic F4 were presented - the colors of which coincide with the colors of Ferrari and ASUS ROG. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7eb/d6b/e43/7ebd6be4378632553c416e93c6af0d0e.jpg"><br>  Liquid cooling systems received an update with an index of 3.0.  The only thing that confuses is the comparison with the Intel boxed cooler instead of competing with similar solutions from Corsair. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a63/7b3/7df/a637b37df1133ea7a48d214b4d3f7eba.jpg">

      <b>MSI</b> <br><br>  The next big producer in today's story will be MSI. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b8/c98/1ee/6b8c981eef7e2fa9fad320d920548a57.jpg"><br>  Everything is sad here ... The new motherboards actually turn out to be old motherboards with a small facelift in red and black colors ... The right word, gentlemen, is embarrassing ... There were no powerful graphics cards besides the reference GeForce GTX Titan either, again the GTX 660Ti and all ... <br>  New compact S30 laptops are quite good in terms of technical characteristics, but white gloss ... Well, for what?!?! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e9a/3de/c02/e9a3dec022e452ea838b77689d0f01e6.jpg"><br>  Gaming laptops, too, shine like shards in the tender spring sunshine, and again I will strongly oppose this approach.  Where have you seen a brilliant lacquered fighter or tank? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd7/b91/2c0/dd7b912c033ff525cc7813f7f12deb8f.jpg"><br>  In order not to gnaw a producer very much, who already loses his share wherever possible, I will praise for such an odd job.  Nettop cool, matte, with a bunch of ports and features.  But even here trouble is ... Intel NUC is more powerful and more compact, and the fact that ports are not less trouble. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe5/516/584/fe55165840f119bd38ce9fc3d9ac3238.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Biostar</b> <br><br>  The company Biostar by the standards of the current CeBIT is one of the mastodons of the industry ... The glory of their T-Power motherboards has died down and now Taiwanese are trying to catch the wave again with the Hi-Fi series, which emphasizes quality and budget (strange combination, right?) Sound . <br><br>  In addition, Biostar was among the first to show motherboards for the LGA1150 socket, a new generation of Intel processors, codenamed Haswell. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e78/3c3/449/e783c344997533ca90bf91ad5a27f021.jpg"><br>  Biostar's flagship solutions on the Intel Z87 chipset feature support for 3D audio and two PCI slots on the low-end model.  In response to the question ‚ÄúWhy do we need PCI slots now?‚Äù, The manufacturer answered briefly: ‚ÄúUsers are asking.‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/484/385/c69/484385c692f89bdb90455a7139d56e71.jpg"><br>  The budget solution for Intel H87 is practically devoid of radiators, it has only 4-phase power, but it supports the Intel Small Business Advantage program.  Why is it only unclear for a small business in the working camps of Hi-Fi sound? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c92/1cc/95b/c921cc95b5aa9964058346aee73347b7.jpg"><br><br>  Today, it's all about what I wanted to tell.  Wait for a new batch of photos tomorrow. <br><br>  Shl.  Unfortunately I can‚Äôt answer all the comments, because I don‚Äôt spend all my time in the press center. <br><br>  ZZY.  I could not post a single lady =) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b9/388/48e/8b938848e5c504add0bda5e062195a12.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171691/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171691/</a></p>
