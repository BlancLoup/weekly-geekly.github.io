  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Book review ‚ÄúInfographics. Communication and Influence with Images ¬ª</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello hablochiteli.  This time I want to share with you my impressions from reading the book <b>‚ÄúInfographics.</b>  <b>Communication and influence with the help of images ‚Äù</b> . <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a36/b0f/55d/a36b0f55d6ade257f7c913b3317235c7.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  The book was recently translated by Peter, and is a marketer‚Äôs view of infographics as an effective marketing tool.  What you learn by reading this book, and to whom, in my opinion, it will be interesting / useful - you can find out in a small review under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The author of the book is Canadian marketer Mark Smikiklas, most likely you, like me, this name does not mean anything, so let's get straight to the point.  Namely: the infographics in the book is viewed through the lens of marketing, however this does not mean that it will be useful only to marketers.  The fact is that the book deals with quite a lot of general issues related to infogafika and visualization of information (yes, mostly information, because there is very little attention given to the data here).  So, the first section is devoted to questions: what is infographics, why does it work and why is it especially relevant today (the struggle for the attention of the audience and so on).  The second section will help you understand when it makes sense to use infographics and why.  The third section is devoted to the development of infographics, it focuses on issues such as: defining the goal of the infogafika, identifying the target audience, the formation of the idea (main message) of the infographic.  The last section covers the issues of the value of infographics for business, the ways of its promotion (distribution) and the assessment of payback. <br><br>  As you can see, from this book you will not learn the features of infographic design, when and which graph is better to use, how to put together several dimensions and many other nuances related directly to the creation of infographics.  But you will form an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat an infographic is, how it is good and what tasks it can solve, when you should use it and how best to do it.  The main advantage of the book is that the author is trying to teach the reader to ask himself the right questions, and the question, as you know, is half the battle.  And even if you do not share the opinions of experts answering the questions in the book, in the process of reading you will form your own opinion on each of the questions.

      So, to whom I would advise to read this book.  Perhaps all <b>newcomers</b> who see that infographics are in trend today and want to figure out what's what.  It could be designers who decided to shift the focus towards information design, and analysts who want to use elements of infographics in their reports, and in general everyone who is interested in this topic, but it is not clear where to start.  And also to all <b>marketers</b> who use or intend to use infographics in their professional activities, even if you don‚Äôt learn anything new, the book will help you to sort through everything that you somehow realized.  For those who have been engaged in the direct creation of infographics for some time, this book is unlikely to open its eyes to something new, unless you are interested in aspects relating solely to marketing. <br><br>  That's all, I hope this short review will help you decide whether to read this book, or spend time on something else. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206388/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206388/</a></p>
