  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some thoughts on the conflict between Nokia and Eldar Murtazin</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I wanted to share some of my observations related to the <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html%3Fid%3D375634">conflict between</a> Nokia and the journalist Murtazin ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/eldarmurtazin/" class="user_link">eldarmurtazin</a> ).  I want to immediately clarify my attitude to both parties involved in the conflict - on the one hand, Nokia has serious problems with the release of new products and platforms, on the other - serious potential and arranging a funeral extremely previously temporarily.  As for Murtazin, I consider his publication as the undisputed market leader in most parameters, and I consider this to be a fair and worthy result of many years of hard work.  But reading the comments of many people, I realized that many obvious moments gadget lovers ignore.  And some facts deserve to pay attention to them. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Over the years, Eldar Viktorovich managed to create a well-established process of influencing the retail market.  In short, his reviews are structured in such a way that they are read by so many representatives of the retail industry - ordinary sellers, purchasing managers, and so on.  It is for them that almost always in the final part of the review there is a device evaluation in the aspect of market sales.  In general, reviews are built largely from the seller‚Äôs point of view - the design is evaluated from the point of view of which price level the model pulls, the positioning of the device in the line and relative to competitors, the target audience, the schedule for price cuts, the release dates of competitors, and others things important to <i>sellers</i> .  If you regularly read Mobile-Review.com, then you will definitely notice this significant difference from reviews of other publications. <br><br>  This is a very significant factor that determines an interesting mechanism of positive feedback.  If you write that ‚Äúthe phone will not be sold,‚Äù his ‚Äúpercentage of returns is extremely high,‚Äù and so on, then many retailers will avoid this model, remove it to disadvantageous places, and will not spend money on advertising.  A small amount of purchases in the first installments will minimize the presence of the affected model in retail outlets, sales assistants will discourage customers from buying new items.  As a result, sales will be minimal, which will surprisingly coincide with the forecast of Eldar Viktorovich.  For market participants, this is a well-known fact, therefore many are forced to reckon with its interests.

      Of course, the predictions are usually based on some real facts, it does not come to outright slander.  But the interpretation of the details, the emotional flow - it all depends on the mood of the author.  This is not surprising, a person can really be saddened by something, for example, there may be some trouble at work: the largest advertiser has stopped placing ads, and a <a href="http://eldarmurtazin.livejournal.com/504582.html">very monetary contract</a> for support in Social Media has gone into some kind of <a href="http://eldarmurtazin.livejournal.com/670085.html%3Fthread%3D20091269">sharash montage</a> .  How to write reviews with this mood? <br><br>  It is important to understand that this mechanism of influence on sales is quite effective, but has certain limits of applicability.  On a strong, from the market point of view, product such spells will act to a much lesser extent than on a product with certain problems, even if uncritical for the final consumer.  In part, we can say that there is an exponential dependence - if a weak apparatus (in the market sense) such a review can simply kill, then a strong player may well get rid of some problems at the start of sales.  It is obvious that the feedback system operates in two directions - it is very difficult to throw down a potential bestseller frankly, this will lead to a drop in confidence from the audience. <br><br>  By the way, from my point of view, there has recently been a certain decline in confidence in MR.  This indicator is very difficult to measure, so I can only share my feelings.  This process, rather, is associated not so much with the objectivity of the reviews, as with a large number of Samsung advertising, including in the form of ‚Äúas advertising‚Äù articles.  This gives the simple reader a sense of one-sided editorial policy, and is aggravated by the statements of Eldar Viktorovich outside of his publication ‚Äî in other media, on his blog, on twitter, and so on.  Honestly, it's hard to say whose problem it is: Samsung or Mobile Review. <br><br>  Another aspect is, in my opinion, the peculiar perception of certain market situations.  For example, Motorola and Nokia almost equally reacted to the problem with the antenna in the iPhone 4 (Death Grip).  Both companies have <a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2010/06/28/how-do-you-hold-your-nokia/">published</a> <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2010/06/30/droid-x-ad-takes-a-shot-at-iphone-4-antenna-woes/">messages</a> that say that their phones can be held with any hand and as you like.  The reaction of Eldar Viktorovich was immediate and entitled "... <a href="http://eldarmurtazin.livejournal.com/697936.html">Nokia or guys without eggs that lie</a> ."  For some reason, Motorola is not mentioned at all.  And other companies for some reason do not deserve such metaphors.  And in vain.  From my point of view, for example, one could continue a series of these posts.  For example, a post with the title ‚Äú... Beeline or girls without eggs that lie‚Äù would be fair, and what is important - both statements would be true, as the marketing efforts of the company recently directly aimed at de-informing the consumer about the real cost of services.  But this is perhaps the topic of a separate conversation.  Another example of a peculiar market vision is the evaluation of companies' policies regarding the support of a large number of software platforms.  In the case of Samsung, this is called ‚Äú <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/pda/review/samsung-galaxy-s.shtml">not putting all the eggs in one basket</a> ‚Äù, while in the case of Nokia the situation looks a little different: ‚Äú <a href="http://mobile-review.com/review/nokia-n8-secondlook.shtml">Zoo, mixing everything and everyone</a> ‚Äù or even ‚Äú <a href="http://eldarmurtazin.livejournal.com/680293.html">Beginning of the end of Nokia</a> ‚Äù.  There are a lot of similar examples and I don‚Äôt think that we should collect them all here. <br><br>  A separate story with the assessments that are made in relation to the top management and security services of the company - except as provocative, it is difficult to call them. <br><br>  In this light, the actions of Nokia seem not very logical, though understandable.  Constant trolling and provoking squabbles on a personal level left no choice to the company, except to begin active operations against the analyst and <i>businessman</i> Murtazin.  But in the future, if these actions are not backed up by a number of Nokia‚Äôs steps in a different plane, the result of this story is a lose-lose situation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98827/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98827/</a></p>
