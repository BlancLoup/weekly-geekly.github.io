Finobox - I read about you and about 20 minutes, probably 20 struggled with your service.  As a result - maybe someday I will use it.  But not now, and not at this time.  Thanks for the fish. <br><br>  Briefly: <br>  Absolutely not liked.  Attempting to browse constantly requests registration.  To use, most likely I will not.  The residual impression is completely negative.  Unfortunately. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why <br>  How many here they write about usability of interfaces and websites, and I see all the same rakes. <br>  Here is an example.  Developers finobox dedicated.  Text - a lot, pictures - a little. <br><br>  Our office now has 2 branches, and it would be interesting for me to look at your system, because it seems that it can solve some problems and simplify the workflow, because 1C is a monster. <br>  I am brave - I decided to check. <br><h4>  Attempt 1 <br></h4>  1. I read on Habr√© about your system. <br>  2. I am fond of beautiful pictures, I decide to find out what it costs and how it does. <br>  3. I scroll through the article on the website one or two times in order to quickly find a link to the site.  With difficulty, but I find. <br>  4. Go to the site <br>  5. I love the beauty of the site, I want to try, what kind of beast is this. <br>  6. I see big beautiful letters - ‚ÄúSimple financial management‚Äù.  I get scared, because an association with complex ERP and CRM systems immediately appears, but I decide to be bolder and press a button. <br>  So, what to press?  There are a lot of them here ... According to button 1 I am offered to <b>register</b> .  I do not want.  I just don't want to.  I watch, not <b>register</b> .  So ... I'm starting to think what to do next.  Passion is so interesting ...

      <b>I return to the main, press button 2.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Button 2 entices with ‚Äúeasy entry‚Äù.  Well, I suppose easy input is good.  Click and enter.  The truth is that where - I am not completely clear, but it is clear that this is due to finances.  I click and get on the authorization form, which requires <b>registration</b> .  So ... I was not promised to <b>register</b> , but easy input.  Returning to the main.  Begins already a bit annoying. <br><br>  <b>I'm back on the main one.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Once, I think, button 1 did not help - I begged for my email, button 2 did not help either, I also begged for email, I hope that button 3 will help.  Feel free to press button three with the tempting and very impressive name ‚ÄúApplication Platform‚Äù.  Wow! <br>  I press it and see how the ‚ÄúForm of mail transfer in form f112‚Äù attracts me.  Powerful, gentlemen developers.  This is probably the most important thing in business and personal finances - since it is at the top.  Strong. <br>  For a second, as the skirt of Merlin Monroe flashes a few more scary words - Statement, Schedule, Consultation. <br>  And now - again a fun window with the requirement to enter a login / password, i.e.  <b>to register</b> .  I said at the beginning that I did not want to <b>register</b> , I would just look at it. <br>  I am ready to leave, to run away from here, although your website beckons me with beautiful pictures, but it urgently requires <b>registration</b> at every step.  I am ready to forget about your project and not to return to it.  Difficult, intrusive, incomprehensible. <br><br>  As a result, just on the basis of that and remembering that somewhere in the article you talked about trial access, etc., I think that maybe I was looking bad. <br>  I wipe my glasses with a clean cloth and start again. <br>  I'm back on the main one.  So ... Buttons are useless - they require <b>registration</b> in one form or another. <br><h4>  Attempt 2 <br></h4><br>  We give a second chance.  We give it to those little links in the basement of the page. <br>  Go. <br>  "Fast entry".  I shake.  Again 25. <b>Registration</b> .  I do not want. <br>  "Enter from twitter".  I shake.  It is not clear, the more I do not use Twitter.  I do not want. <br>  "App Store".  I shake.  Again 25. <b>Registration</b> .  I do not want. <br>  "Video".  Strange word.  Reminds stale socks Lebedev.  I do not even want to reap.  I do not video production - I look at the resource. <br><br>  So.  In my head everything is in full swing - after all, they wrote the same, they wrote on Habr√© that everything is easy and simple and can be viewed. <br>  It becomes interesting - what am I doing wrong. <br><br><h4>  Attempt 3 !!! <br></h4><br>  Back to home. <br>  I read slowly and carefully. <br>  Top links. <br>  FAQ Help Secure Access Login <br><br>  FAQ - not yet needed. <br><br>  Help - hmm ... maybe needed <br><br>  Secure access - okay. <br><br>  To come in <br><br>  I decide that I need to click "Login". <br>  I shake.  PPV  <b>Registration</b> again. <br>  Again on the main. <br><br>  Click now "Protected Access" <br>  Safari is outraged and writes about the certificate.  In order to go further, I need to take it.  I do not want.  Cancel.  Back  To main. <br><br>  Help. <br>  Oops.  <b>Registration</b> again.  Vaughn sotuda - home. <br><br>  FAQ. <br>  I want to.  It's just a nightmare. <br>  Instead of describing what IT does and how it can help me, I see the question <b>‚ÄúIs the finobox service free?‚Äù</b> . <br>  Lord  The service is free or not - I don‚Äôt care about it yet, because I still can‚Äôt understand what your super service will give me. <br><br>  Hence - out of here.  Again on the main. <br><br>  I see more alluring links: <br><br>  STS tax return <br><br>  Creating accounts and acts <br><br>  Creation of payment orders <br><br>  PDF statements <br><br>  They all demand from me ... What?  That's right - <b>Registration</b> , <b>Registration</b> , <b>Registration</b> , <b>Registration</b> .  PPV  The airport is easier ... <br><br><h4>  Attempt 4 <br></h4><br>  And only carefully looking at the <b>registration</b> window (4th attempt to use) I see on the right a small link ‚ÄúDemo entry‚Äù.  Blah  Here it is.  I thought that the big picture ‚ÄúDemo Entrance‚Äù at the top right of the registration form is a link to the coveted access.  gut  no words. <br><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/f78Fz0lFN7hDj8U4SAIVYA%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ZzofP3Gc6KY/S7ZtFbkJESI/AAAAAAAAAFM/HSN0z_cR1nY/s400/FinoBox1.png"></a> </td></tr><tr><td>  Album: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/tnt.ufa/Habr%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite">habr</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h4>  Attempt 5. Again on the main. </h4><br>  I decided to quest.  I found a demo entry !!!  I am a hero!!! <br>  I came in.  And what do I see?  I see inscriptions about renting apartments, cafes and taxis.  Everything. <br>  It's almost gone. <br>  Last - I'll try to create an account.  Beautiful and correct.  Without 1 With - with your help. <br>  I'm already inside, I spent so much time.  I have to, I just have to create an account. <br><br>  <b>PSTA a s b.</b> <b><br></b>  Scrolling through the list of applications on the right. <br>  Found - like it.  Accounts acts.  I click. <br>  It's all.  This is the end.  This is a brain collapse - a little red at the top of the browser browser tells me <br>  "Mistake.  Select payments. ‚Äù <br>  Patience breaks completely, irrevocably and forever. <br><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/L6EaK2jBj7zY9DZGdAuw7Q%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ZzofP3Gc6KY/S7ZtFj6ZHMI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/iXT2tDNRw8k/s800/FinoBox2.png"></a> </td></tr><tr><td>  Album: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/tnt.ufa/Habr%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite">habr</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  I went from here.  Goodbye. <br><br><h4>  Summary. <br></h4>  Dear developers! <br>  I spent some time on the site, re-clicked a bunch of links, but they all required registration. <br>  If it were not for the article on Habr√©, I would have left after the third link.  But I tried.  I honestly tried.  I even wrote you a review here (you are reading it now).  I kept to the last, but did not understand what kind of service it was and whether it would be useful to me.  I realized the only thing is that with his help you can do something connected with an apartment, a cafe and a taxi.  For an apartment, I do not pay - bought.  Costs for cafes - there is a corporate card.  Taxi - God be with him, taxis are also paid by bank transfer. <br><br>  Impression - I do not need this service in business.  At the very least, this opinion has developed after reviewing your site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89829/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89829/</a></p>
