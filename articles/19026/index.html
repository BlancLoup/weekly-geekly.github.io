The winners are chosen by the Internet community itself, and the awarding takes place offline - in the most solemn atmosphere. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Best technological innovation / achievement</strong> <br>  <a href="http://earthmine.com/">Earthmine</a> , working on a geospatial platform that allows you to create three-dimensional panoramas of the real world with the ability to use them in various web applications. <br><br>  <strong>Best self-developed startup</strong> <br>  <a href="http://techmeme.com/">Techmeme</a> , collecting publications about technologies from all over the Internet and automatically sorting them by popularity.  Since its inception, he has been able to attract the attention of a huge number of web publishers, bloggers and authors from the technological sphere. <br><br>  <strong>Best New Device / Gadget</strong> <br>  Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> , deserved the title of the phone with the most convenient design, and which in the days of the sale became the reason for the huge queues at the stores.  The apparatus "conquered" America and several European countries, but is not in a hurry to come to Russia.

      <strong>Best business model</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/">Zazzle</a> , giving the opportunity to create personal designs for clothing, posters, postage stamps and postcards and then sell finished products. <br><br>  <strong>Best design</strong> <br>  <a href="http://smugmug.com/">SmugMug</a> - photo hosting, which among many similar services is distinguished by cool design, the authors of which have designed the site to the smallest detail. <br><br>  <strong>Best startup in the corporate segment</strong> <br>  <a href="http://zoho.com/">Zoho</a> , creating web-based business applications: text and spreadsheet editor, project management system, CRM, etc. <br><br>  <strong>Best startup in the consumer segment</strong> <br>  <a href="http://meebo.com/">Meebo</a> , which allows you to exchange messages from your site on several systems at once: AOL, GTalk, MSN and Yahoo.  The service also offers users the ability to add chat rooms to their applications. <br><br>  <strong>Best Mobile Startup</strong> <br>  <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is an incredibly popular service in the US that allows people to share information about what they are doing at the moment.  This is often called microblogging, because the length of the recording in its tape is limited to 140 characters.  It is called mobile because users most often send messages to their blog from the phone - via SMS or via the mobile Internet. <br><br>  <strong>Best international startup</strong> <br>  <a href="http://netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a> , giving each user the opportunity to create their personalized start page - with separate blocks: news and rss-channels, recent mail, search on the Internet, video catalogs, etc. <br><br>  <strong>The best embodiment of the concept of "user-generated content"</strong> <br>  <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a> , the most famous social news service, where users add news themselves, rate and comment on them.  In runet work analogues - <a href="http://news2.ru/">News2</a> , <a href="http://smi2.ru/">Smi2</a> and others. <br><br>  <strong>Best video service</strong> <br>  <a href="http://hulu.com/">Hulu</a> is a professional video site from major publishers.  At the very beginning, many doubted that this project would be able to withstand competition from YouTube.  But now, when the developers have moved far ahead and the benefits of the service have become visible to everyone, there are not many who have doubts left. <br><br>  <strong>Best environmental startup</strong> <br>  <a href="http://teslamotors.com/">Tesla Motors</a> , developed the most impressive cars on electronic engines.  For example, a roadster that reaches 60 mph in 5 seconds. <br><br>  <strong>The best use of viral marketing</strong> <br>  <a href="http://stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a> , offering you sites that other users have chosen with similar interests.  Having received only $ 1.5 million in investment, the service was able to gather an audience of more than 4 million users, and was bought this year by eBay for $ 75 million. <br><br>  <strong>The best "time eater"</strong> <br>  <a href="http://kongregate.com/">Kongregate</a> , the founder of which calls its service just like the Xbox for casual games online.  On the site, users can not only play a lot of logical and akradny games, but also place their own, receiving revenues from advertising. <br><br>  <strong>The most active desire to make the world better</strong> <br>  <a href="http://donorschoose.org/">DonorsChoose</a> , thanks to which teachers and schools can receive various material assistance from those who wish to assist the educational process. <br><br>  <strong>Great chance of success</strong> <br>  <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> is the most popular open-source standalone blog engine.  Wordpress has gained immense popularity, many plug-ins have been written for it, thousands of design templates have been created and it continues to evolve. <br><br>  <strong>Best Startup Founder</strong> <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> , a 23-year-old programmer who created the world's most popular social network, Facebook.  A suitable owner of such an award, because still few people at that age have managed to create a company of this magnitude in such a short time and become a true billionaire. <br><br>  <strong>Best CEO</strong> <br>  Toni Schneider, a successful entrepreneur and investor from True Ventures, made a large, profitable and growing company from a beginner open source project called Wordpress. <br><br>  <strong>Best New Startup 2007</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.imedix.com/">iMedix</a> , which <a href="http://www.imedix.com/">aims</a> to revolutionize the US medical system by creating an online community in which users share information about diseases, share experiences, and can receive treatment advice from professionals. <br><br>  <strong>The best in everything</strong> <br>  <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> is perhaps the only project that does not require additional descriptions and explanations.  A well-deserved victory of the most popular and successful startup in 2007. <br><br>  The award ceremony took place at the Herbst Theater in San Francisco.  As they say, there were several surprises on it, including the performance of the authors of the popular movie ‚Äú <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DI6IQ_FOCE6I">Here Comes Another Bubble</a> ‚Äù, who <a href="http://youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DB7XveeXr7Wg">performed</a> live the <a href="http://youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DB7XveeXr7Wg">favorite song about start-ups</a> . <br><br>  Photos from the event can be viewed <a href="http://flickr.com/search/show/%3Fq%3D2007crunchies">here</a> . <br><br>  By the way, Steve Jobs, as a winner in one of the nominations, could not visit The Crunchies and receive his award.  On this occasion, the Internet even appeared a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DYmfP6aXNSis">comic video</a> in which a person posing as the head of Apple, talks about his attitude to this event. <br><br>  via <a href="http://techhh.com/">Techhh</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19026/</a></p>
