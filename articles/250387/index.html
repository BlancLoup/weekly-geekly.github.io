    <h4>  Why do we need popular control? </h4><br>  When the base station is commissioned, it is assumed that it provides a good level of communication throughout its coverage.  However, the network is almost a living structure.  Somewhere a house is being built, somewhere a house is being demolished, somewhere a tree grows above the roof and so on.  Simply put, the interference pattern of radio wave propagation is changing. <br><br>  Network service signaling allows you to very quickly detect failures on the equipment itself.  Naturally, we need data of constant measurements at different points of the coverage, plus a means of searching for difficult-to-diagnose bugs. <br><br>  The first tool is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/172871/">field lab</a> .  Machine with multiple antennas and terminals inside: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bff/baf/1b0/bffbaf1b03119f8f83b9b8e2ad186669.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Check out the laboratory is quite expensive, plus patrol cars on the city is usually a dozen or less.  Naturally, another means was needed.  So we bought a container of pink Samsung Galaxy S II for the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/191968/">MQA</a> project to make such wonderful devices that we put in our company cars: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7a/055/5b7/f7a0555b7b0e46b49356cfeabf5d293d.png"><br><br>  This made it possible to dramatically increase the coverage of ‚Äúpatrols‚Äù and, if necessary, bring devices into basements, but cut off the research functionality.  It was assumed that the application that runs on these pink phones will be installed to users who want to help. <br><br>  <b>However, there were two problems:</b> <br>  1. Constant measurements greatly increase food consumption, as a rule, at least 50‚Äì70%.  Plus traffic of about 200 MB per day at least. <br>  2. Even with the voluntary consent of the subscriber to the installation, the application collects too much data, which creates a number of legal difficulties.  In fact, we could afford to distribute the application only to our engineers under the terms of the license to provide communications in the territory of the Russian Federation. <br><br><h4>  People's control </h4><br>  In the end, realizing that with 100% automation, not everything is as smooth as we would like, we raised a service that allows you to just poke a point on the map and describe what the problem is there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f7/33b/2d1/6f733b2d10e44e6ba7bf0387f5143b19.png"><br><br>  In the test, it worked like this: the subscriber enters the site, indicates the address and feedback.  Then the review is sorted: something goes with the ticket to the engineers at the service of network operation, something goes to the usual support (sometimes, a person asks for a tariff) and so on.  In practice, out of 700 reviews, 200 went into tickets, 182 of them went to the service department.  We responded to 100% feedback within 48 hours. <br><br>  The second point of entry: in each sales office in Tatarstan there were special laptops in the hall in a prominent place where this site was opened.  The staff was trained to explain the reviews, plus there were posters, the sellers had badges about this service. <br><br>  The third point: we did a student quest with a storyline, which also came down to measurements in various difficult places in the city.  300 students sketched us about 50 technical tickets. <br><br>  They write not only from Kazan - there were reviews from subscribers whose numbers are not in our regional capacity. <br><br>  Approximately 10% of tickets required additional payment - by experience, we waited for a larger number, but subscribers tried to write in great detail. <br><br>  <b>Engineering ticket is being studied.</b>  As a rule, it takes 2 days to process the application and respond to it.  Most of the tasks were solved during the second day (on the first day the point is scheduled for the next, then the engineer goes and looks at the site). <br><br>  Not all tickets can be resolved quickly or in general can be solved.  For example, the subscriber does not like the quality of communication in the shopping center with the architecture of a ‚Äúbank of rebar + glass with metal‚Äù.  Naturally, there you need to put an indoor solution like <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/194960/">this</a> .  In this case, we answered the subscriber about the approximate timing of the decision and the reasons why it is impossible to make the connection good today. <br><br>  By resolved tickets - most of all there were cases of sudden construction projects for us, where the sector stopped finishing up to the border of the coverage area.  From the interesting - at one of the points, the LTE antenna was loose; the subscriber complained about the absence of the LTE signal.  Left, found (such a service alarm does not show). <br><br><h4>  Examples of references </h4><br>  <b>Appeal:</b> <blockquote>  On the street, the connection catches well, all sticks, at home not very high 3, in some parts of the apartment does not catch at all, although I live on the 4th floor, it seems not very low. The second line is wonderful everything. With 3G and H changes to Gprs and Edge. With this instability does not depend on the place of stay.  For a long time, around the month in the apartment, only the edge and caught, has recently stabilized to 3g and H. sometimes calls when the phone is switched on do not reach. The phone is on the table and SMS arrives that they cannot reach you. </blockquote><br>  The situation is generally ordinary: the metal structures of the building weaken the 3G signal, and the 2G signal with the best distribution normally goes into the room.  The subscriber fell into the interference minimum, where the phone "jumps" between 2G and 3G.  This is solved only by increasing the density of the installation of 3G BS in Naberezhnye Chelny.  The subscriber was told about it and explained that in 2015 it is planned to install 15 more base stations, which should resolve the issue. <br><br>  <b>Subscriber's comment:</b> <blockquote> Thank you for your reply!  I am very pleased that the company takes time to respond to customer feedback! </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Appeal:</b> <blockquote>  No LTE coverage.  4G is missing.  Sim card usim, with 4g.  Tablet ipad mini retina.  Moskovsky district, city of Kazan, st.  Decembrists 191/93 </blockquote><br>  This is a duplicate of what we already saw on the service signaling.  Repaired nominally. <br><br>  <b>Subscriber's comment:</b> <blockquote>  Everything worked) thanks, Polina! <br>  Kazan office is the best in the Volga region. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Here is another interesting case.</b>  The subscriber complained that every month he had the same problem with his USB modem: after charging subscription fee, the speed of the mobile Internet does not increase to the original level, and he has to call for support every time asking him to fix it. <br><br>  By the time of the call, he had already launched the procedure for changing the number and, at the same time, upon seeing the site, left a review.  We picked up the download of all calls and found that every time support lifted him manually, but no one saw the systematics.  As a result, a rather difficult reproducible error was found in the settings of the system, which our colleagues almost immediately corrected.  We told all this to the subscriber and asked for another chance.  The subscriber believed us, the transfer canceled.  Following the results, the subscriber stayed with us, thanked for participation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250387/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250387/</a></p>
