  <section class="page js-page"><h1>uCoz - statistics of users of the system for seven years</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today marks 7 years since the opening of the uCoz web service. <br>  In this regard, I wanted to share a bit, I am sure, with interesting statistics. <br>  At the beginning of the figures will go interesting, although a little laudatory.  And then just curious: the number of living sites, gender and age structure of their creators, etc. <br><br>  Separately, it must be said that traditionally companies are reluctant to share such information, consider it a commercial secret, and even less often disclose the calculation methodology, trying to announce the loudest and most exaggerated figures. <br>  In this regard, from the very beginning, a fundamentally different model was chosen from the very beginning.  We did not overestimate the data on the number of sites in the system, saying only ‚Äúlive‚Äù.  I want to continue this tradition. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If we talk about loud numbers, we can say that over 7 years more than <strong>17 million</strong> sites have been created in the system.  But this includes registration by bots, which, nevertheless, regularly crawl through our difficult registration, and which we mercilessly delete.  A huge number of test sites created for the sake of experiments, checks, alternate aerodromes, etc., whose life cycle is traditionally short, and which are also automatically deleted.  And, of course, this figure includes a large number of sites that once were created, then turned out to be abandoned creators, and also ceased to exist.

      Total, today we have <strong>1 million 114 thousand 379 active sites</strong> .  They, in turn, are created by approximately <strong>580 thousand</strong> administrators. <br><br>  That is, we can say that, on average, there are approximately two ‚Äúlive‚Äù sites per active user of the system.  At the same time, the most active ones have noticeably more than two or three sites, there are those who have more than a hundred of them, and all of these are full-fledged sites.  Own or client. <br><br>  Of course, some of the sites are test ones, the lifetime of which is small, or created not so long ago, and they, together with their owners, will not remain in the system.  But during this time they will come, and not in smaller quantities, new ones. <br><br>  All these sites generate very noticeable traffic.  The total number of system hosts is <strong>8 million</strong> per day. <br><br>  The most popular service and method of comparing Internet projects is traditionally Alexa Internet. <br><br>  According to <a href="">her, ucoz.ru</a> no less traditionally ranks in the <strong>top 200</strong> in world sites, and today in Russia and Ukraine it is located on the <strong>13th position</strong> .  But, if we remember that Yukoz has other domains, in particular, <a href="">ucoz.com</a> , and the fact that, for example, we can see Google, for example, Google twice, as google.ru and google.com, in Alex's Top Russia, we get the same traditional entry into the <strong>top 10</strong> . <br>  &gt; <br>  By the way, Alex takes into account only sites on our domains, that is, does not consider sites with their domains, as a second level such as .ru, .com.  and third - .net.ru, com.ua, etc.  And our statistics for today is such, and this is already an interesting stastika, that <strong>2/3 of the traffic of the</strong> system falls on sites with their domain names.  Which is not surprising.  The better and older the site, the more likely it is that it acquires its second-level domain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fb/770/230/6fb770230657f38fc03c31c092a10a0e.png" alt="Traffic generated by uCoz sites"><br><br>  It is also interesting that this ratio is changing quite dynamically.  And a year and a half ago, it was 50 to 50, and before that the share of traffic to sites with their domains was less.  That is, we can say that our webmasters, and webmasters as a whole, demonstrate an increasingly mature approach to web construction and their sites. <br><br>  Website building and computers have always attracted boys more than girls, so the sexual structure will not surprise you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/671/bee/838/671bee838943c6abf2664a9feb6f0654.png" alt="Distribution graph of uCoz administrators by gender. Gender"><br><br>  However, the percentage of girls webmasters grew (by 4.8% compared with 2008), so that on the spot of a strong half of humanity, I would not relax ... <br>  Meanwhile, while our girls are actively mastering site building, it turned out that young people began to be interested in women's topics.  We considered the experiment for the sake of boys and girls registered on the websites of women's topics (diet, knitting, cometology, etc.) and men's topics (cars, fishing, football, etc.), and found that boys are more likely to sit on women‚Äôs sites than girls on men. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdb/273/305/fdb27330561ffd7435fcc01ba7aa4f09.png" alt="Distribution by gender of uID accounts on websites of male and female subjects"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a88/ddb/e2c/a88ddbe2cb3154dc4f17c9537b9039b8.png" alt="Distribution by gender of uID accounts on websites of male and female subjects"><br><br>  As for the age structure of administrators of active uCoz sites, it will delight those who love holivars on the subject of shkoloty on the Internet and in Yukoz.  And, of course, our users are growing up with us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1b/ba6/cbf/d1bba6cbf13204ab5799f4536353edb6.png" alt="Distribution of site administrators by age"><br><br>  The honorable <strong>first place</strong> is occupied by the Yukozy people aged <strong>16 to 20 years</strong> .  The second place was chosen by the so-called working youth, who, after graduating from the university, still finds time for webmasters or even earns money with it.  The third place is occupied by schoolchildren, who in recent years have been more and more actively mastering the Internet and website building in particular.  We should also say that the number of site administrators from 36 years and older is slowly but surely growing over the last 4 years.  Keep it up! <br>  About internationality can be judged by the languages ‚Äã‚Äãin which sites are created in the system. <br>  There are no surprises here either - most of our users create resources in Russian. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c2/02b/4de/4c202b4de17a1e18e24dd05119fcfbc9.png" alt="Distribution of sites in the uCoz system by language"><br><br>  Among the sites in foreign languages, we are dominated by sites in <strong>English</strong> , the second place is taken by sites created in Ukrainian, and Romanian and Spanish are the bronze.  The share of non-Russian uCoz sites is actively growing: it <strong>doubled</strong> from 2010 to 2012. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/627/206/218/62720621872b387762fddd61ab0303c5.png" alt="Distribution of non-Russian sites in the uCoz system"><br><br>  Approximately 20 percent of the system sites participate in the <strong>TOP uCoz</strong> ranking, in which they choose a category.  20% of the participants didn‚Äôt really decide on the topic and brought their websites to the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category.  The list of those who indicated the category is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/599/c11/d66/599c11d66d9ea96ca9381b2efebca857.png" alt="Distribution of sites by categories in the top uCoz"><br><br>  <i>In the business category are grouped subcategories: companies, e-commerce, real estate, construction, insurance, business and finance, services and goods.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In the category of entertainment subcategories are grouped together: humor, cinema, literature, recreation, photos.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156545/</a></p>
