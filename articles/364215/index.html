As it turned out a few hours after the termination of work, on December 9, the Swedish police paid a visit to the Pirate Bay data center and seized some equipment, including computers and servers. <br><br>  The Pirate Bay is still not working.  Its operators are no strangers to large-scale legal prosecution.  But one of the founders of Payrat Bey <a href="http://blog.brokep.com/2014/12/09/the-pirate-bay-down-forever/">expressed doubts</a> about the possibility of resuming the functioning of the site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5,_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Peter Sunde</a> (also known by his nickname brokep) just recently - on November 10, 2014 - <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bays-peter-sunde-released-prison-141011/">was</a> released after serving five months in prison in the case of The Pirate Bay.  Today it does not play such a big role in the life of the resource. <br><br>  A former representative of the galaxy‚Äôs most rebellious bittorrent site recalled the last police raid 8 years ago.  It was caused by the pressure of the film industry, behind the raid was the American Film Association (MPAA).  What was the reason this time is still unknown.

      In 2006, the raid led to street demonstrations and protest from many people.  Today, he said, few people are excited; people take the site for granted. <br><br>  Sunde said that TPB practically does not develop, no one improves his old engine, full of bugs.  The only thing that is undergoing changes is advertising, which is more and more on the site. <br><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b9/b5f/f33/8b9b5ff33f63402fa186cb9651a0434d.jpg" align="left" width="400"></a>  It was originally planned to close The Pirate Bay on its tenth birthday.  Instead, in 2013, a noisy party with a paid entrance was organized in Stockholm.  As described by Sunde, some company sent half-naked girls, who attracted potential customers by distributing promotional materials. <br><br>  Sunde says that in recent years, the original ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù team has left The Pirate Bay, and the new employees are not very enthusiastic.  Sunde did not feel in novices any interest in helping the community, unless it promises a cash reward. <br><br>  Over the years, Sunde deliberately and unsuccessfully tried to disrupt the image of The Pirate Bay, because it seemed to him that people were worshiping the resource too much.  A large promotional block on the main page for musicians, which was added by a new team, called the co-founder of the site an attempt to support the image, rather than a real action. <br><br>  Sunde hopes that the site is closed forever, and Internet users will be able to create something new and without advertising, something better, faster, more reliable and without the ability to decompose;  what the idea will be supported to be supported. <br><br>  It is easy to see in his words the isolation from reality: in eight years on The Pirate Bay, much has changed.  Today magnet links are used, which means that almost nothing is stored on the servers.  The index with all files fits into 90 megabytes, it allows you to deploy your own version yourself. <br><br>  However, the 90-megabyte project has not been updated since 2013, and for its creation it was necessary to take into account the peculiarities of the anti-DDoS system: the pumping IP-address was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D8728595">blocked</a> almost 10 times. <br><br>  Advertising was required for spending on legal protection of the site, and it costs a lot of money. <br><br>  The seriousness of current events can be judged by the involvement of the chief of the national police of Sweden and some of the statements of the authorities.  <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-has-not-been-resurrected-yet-141210/">According to the TorrentFreak website</a> , at least one person was detained. <br><br>  Now in some places there are new mirrors of the site, but they all depend on the original.  <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-has-not-been-resurrected-yet-141210/">Most often</a> mention a <a href="http://thepiratebay.cr/">copy of the domain zone of Costa Rica</a> .  Of course, this is not an independent site - ThePirateBay.cr is listed in the <a href="https://proxybay.info/list.txt">list of mirrors</a> .  Some even <a href="https://www.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/p/keep-calm-and-navigate-to-thepiratebay-cr/">started</a> selling T-shirts and other merchandise with the name of the mirror, as if the site had moved to this domain. <br><br>  A negative trend continues: EZTV, Torrage, Zoink, Istole and Suprbay.org have gone offline with The Pirate Bay.  For a long time the biggest tracker of the world OpenBitTorrent has <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/242542/">not worked</a> . <br><br>  It is not known whether the current site operators are planning to resume work.  Technically, this is possible because The Pirate Bay has a distributed structure.  <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/195647-the-pirate-bay-raided-shut-down-by-swedish-police-and-it-may-never-return">It is believed</a> that its servers are located in many countries.  Held raid will see if this is in fact. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364215/</a></p>
