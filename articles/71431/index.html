Who, like me, only recently found out about it, from the tasty there: Support for subfolders deeper than the second level (since 5.55) and the SensMe service.  SensMe is already familiar to the owners of Sony Ericsson Walkman, now it is in the PSP.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Look and feel </h2><br>  Honestly I was surprised to see Media Go for the first time.  I really respect Sony, but let's talk openly: it's now accepted to call this interface iTunes-like.  Although it may be a plus - time-tested and user-friendly interface to which the user does not have to get used to. <br><br>  Installation took quite a long time, which the installer spent on installing C ++ Developer something there, the .NET Framework of two kinds, Quick Time (for video encoding), Flash (for the integrated PSN browser).  It was because of the abundance of left libraries that I could not put it under Wine, so I had to raise the virtual machine.  After installation, the program will offer you to customize yourself, import all your media files.  Quite a slow operation, but in half an hour I managed to process 65 gigabytes of music / series / photos on my computer.  It also offers to determine which devices you have in stock.  Connecting them is not required. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5c/c01/38e/c5cc0138ee94c56f5c93c7845d64fde7.png"></a> <br><br>  Immediately it was useful to watch how the program works with podcasts.  Always envious of the owners of iPods, they may not care about manually downloading podcasts.  Their iTunes will check, download and put on a saucer - very cool.  So now we got the same thing, the owners of the PSP and Walkman.  Quickly click on import and add your favorite podcasts to the terminal.  Everything works, it pleases, the program carefully shakes the latest episodes of all podcasts (by the way, without even asking about it - users of expensive Internet, carefully).  In addition to manual import, there is also a list of podcasts, which contains the most famous foreign podcasters. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd3/110/cb7/dd3110cb773e8f7271be7dd0090ec326.png"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/618/a22/ea2/618a22ea2b0233cc64373fc29661c550.png"></a> <br><br>  Well, there is also the ability to view photos and movies.  Here, I think, there is nothing surprising.  Liked pictures can be immediately downloaded to your device.  Movies can be converted and done the same. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe7/0f9/cad/fe70f9cad7bc2c3b6cb9ef9bc40c70fd.png"></a> <br><br><h2>  And now about the bad </h2><br>  There are no perfect products.  From the first time they usually release "just to work".  I hope Sony will not stop at this and will constantly refine its application.  But so far I have noticed some very unpleasant moments that prevent me from using Media Go normally. <br><br>  <b>Only firmware 6.10.</b>  Here it is.  This is why I am ready to beat my head on the table and beat myself with a stapler.  Unfortunately, the M33 and GEN teams have so far failed to crack the new firmware from Sony.  (Now they will beat me and tell me that pirated software is bad.) For the time being, I cannot take advantage of all the charms of Media Go because of this.  Sorry, waiting for a response Dark-Alex'a and the team. <br><br>  <b>No support for Last.fm.</b>  Well, ashamed.  In 2009, do not support the simplest API, which even the student will master.  We assume - did not have time. <br>  Here from the audience they suggest that in windows it is not customary to support last.fm from the box and you need to install some kind of application.  Um, okay, thanks. <br><br>  <b>No Linux and Mac versions.</b>  Well, everything is clear.  Sony protected itself with the .NET Framework and will simply not be able to port the player to other systems.  Very sorry. <br><br>  <b>Miracles of translation.</b>  Well, here I really find fault with it.  But still it would be worthwhile to call at least one Russian-speaking person in order not to allow the phrases ‚Äúthe file can be problematic‚Äù (see the second screenshot above). <br><br><h2>  Some statistics </h2><br><br>  <b>Supported file types:</b> <br>  Audio: .3gp, .flac, .m4a, .m4b, .mp4, .mp3, .wav, .wma <br>  Video: .3gp, .avi *, .m4v, .mnv, .mp4, .mov, .o4v, .odf, .qt, .wmv <br>  Images: .bmp, .gif, .jpe, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .tif, .tiff <br><br>  <b>System requirements:</b> <br>  Microsoft¬Æ Windows¬Æ XP Service Pack 3 (32-bit only) or later, or Windows Vista¬Æ (32-bit or 64-bit) <br>  1 GHz processor <br>  1 GB RAM <br>  200 MB of free hard disk space for program installation <br><br><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><br>  Who, as always, is too lazy to read all my writings, I will briefly describe the pros and cons of Media Go. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ul><li>  Sync PSP and Walkman in the manner of iTunes + iPod. </li><li>  Create SensMe playlists. </li><li>  Good podcast terminal. </li><li>  Multi-language support </li><li>  It's a Sony;) ‚Äã‚Äã[/ irony] </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  Only firmware 6.10. </li><li>  No last.fm support. </li><li>  Pretty gluttonous.  200 MB of RAM like a bush.  Songbird, I can still allow such freedom, it has functions over 9000, but here I am puzzled. </li><li>  No versions for Linux and Mac </li><li>  Translation nuances </li></ul><br><br>  Who will not upload photos, here is the link to the album: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/vas3k007/MediaGo">http://picasaweb.google.com/vas3k007/MediaGo</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71431/</a></p>
