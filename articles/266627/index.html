  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Himself a virtual operator</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Mobile communications successfully fit into the IT infrastructure of Russian companies.  The high level of penetration of communication and the spread of mobile devices gives businesses a lot of benefits, the main among which is the ability to retain the client and receive additional income. <br><br>  Paradoxically, despite the popularity of mobile tools in the service business, many companies do not even suspect that ... in just 15 minutes it is possible to launch your own mobile operator - MVNO (mobile virtual network network operator).  You can sell your SIM-cards, set tariffs, develop sets of services, which, in turn, in addition to the guaranteed wow-effect will ensure a stable profit.  In this case, the company does not bear the cost of equipment, software and qualified engineers that support the network. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tottoli_gsm/blog/266627/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b04/be9/397/b04be93970354bf58477d2a1b83a4805.jpg"></a>

      Thus, own MVNO is available to almost any business that is ready to receive a promising source of income and a reliable tool for working with clients.  Moreover, the dynamics of the market contributes to this model - for example, according to J'son &amp; Partners Consulting estimates, the growth rate in the field of mobile banking from 2014 to 2018 will be 28%, and the benefit from the use of convergent communication will increase 1.5 times.  Is this not an argument? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#0071BC">MVNO is not a lyrical digression.</font> </h2><br>  MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) is a virtual telecom operator that provides services under its own brand, but does not have its own technical base.  That is, the operator produces its branded SIM-cards, with its tariffs and services, but it does not have its own radio frequency resource and radio transmission infrastructure, but simply rents them using networks, switches, and sometimes billing of the cellular operator. <br><br>  From an engineering point of view, MVNO is a scheme for implementing a virtual network based on the existing radio transmission infrastructure of cellular operators.  In the diagram you can see that the entire physical part is located in the MNO plane - a regular cellular operator, and the virtual ‚Äúgets‚Äù HLR (database with information about subscribers of this network) / AuC (authentication center) and MSC is a switching service, which can connect to the PSTN - public telephone network.  The MSC of the virtual operator interacts with the BSC (Base Station Controller), which unites the base stations and contains all the control logic and connects to the MSC mobile switching center (and it directly controls the connection between subscribers).  It turns out a kind of symbiosis - a network with selected capabilities is added to the normal network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e7/ade/465/4e7ade46557c4d97b2a594c575a41088.jpg"><br><br>  From an economic point of view, such an operator is a profitable story: in fact, you can buy traffic at wholesale prices and resell at your retail or give it away, if required by the strategy and goal of creating an MVNO.  Low prices for virtual operator services are due to the fact that there is no need to pay for expensive equipment, radio frequencies, maintain, develop and modernize infrastructure.  Accordingly, the vacated budget can be directed to the conquest of its consumer segment and the development of a narrow niche.  In general, a narrow product niche is a MVNO feature that is valuable for business: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>economic value</b> - income from the sale of traffic and services to subscribers, a narrow focus on the selected segment ensures a pool of active subscribers <br><br></li><li>  <b>Commercial value</b> - retention of subscribers with obvious advantages and benefits (low price, cheap roaming, useful content, etc.) <br><br></li><li>  <b>psychological value</b> - the formation of a narrow circle (the niches of their subscribers who share the brand philosophy. </li></ul><br>  Recently, another prerequisite appeared on the Russian market, which plays into the hands of the company, which decided to create MVNO - phones and smartphones with two SIM-cards.  According <a href="http://json.tv/ict_telecom_analytics_view/rossiyskiy-rynok-smartfonov-itogi-2014-goda-20150120020050">to J'son &amp; Partners Consulting</a> , the total share of sales of smartphones with two or more SIM cards in the Russian Federation in 2014 was 60%.  This is a serious growth, especially since manufacturers began to offer two SIM cards not only on budget models, but also on flagships.  To this figure, you can add those who consistently have two phones from the category: "my eternal number" and "for promotional and cheap SIMs."  In fact, many of your subscribers (customers) do not need to painfully choose an operator, just insert a second SIM card into the phone. <br><br>  Obviously, MVNO is a good solution for the tourism industry, providers, retail chains, banks, fixed-line operators, payment systems, etc ... There is a common set of benefits that each company can get in the listed areas of activity. <br><br><ul><li>  Using MVNO for e-commerce and mobile advertising - a virtual operator in its own network is free to regulate content and use advertising functions at its discretion. <br><br></li><li>  Distribution of alerts and the provision of information services.  For example, the implementation of a mobile help desk in which the subscriber will be able to request information.  Moreover, any VAS (value added services is an additional service) can be implemented in two main models: <br><br>  1) interactive class - access to services is provided through the web ‚Äî browser of the mobile device <br>  2) background class - the service is distributed by subscription (balance, exchange rate, data from the terminal, etc.) <br><br></li><li>  Use of machine-to-machine (M2M) services - tracking sensors, indicators, information from ATMs or terminals via the GSM network. <br><br></li><li>  Communication with the consumer, the provision of technical and service support. <br><br></li><li>  Creating home zones is important for retail, banks, large entertainment and travel companies, large enterprises and agglomerations of enterprises. <br><br></li><li>  Work with employees: monitoring, provision of communication. </li></ul><br>  Thus, MVNO combines the advantages of conventional GSM and VoIP mobile communications, which makes it a serious and sought-after tool for large companies. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071BC">MVNO creation opportunities by industry</font> </h2><br>  Our company has long been engaged in the creation of virtual operators for B2B, and today the experience of <a href="http://tottoli-gsm.com/ru/"><b>Tottoli</b></a> allows <a href="http://tottoli-gsm.com/ru/"><b>us</b></a> to identify several main areas that successfully use "their cellular network."  Initially it was clear that different business areas need different MVNO configurations.  Therefore, we managed to create optimal solutions based on the needs of each group of potential virtual network owners.  We distinguish three main types of creating a virtual operator. <br><br>  <a href="http://tottoli-gsm.com/ru/light-mvno.html"><b>Light MVNO</b></a> is a simple solution that does not impose any serious management obligations on the owner.  In fact, this is a reseller scheme, introducing which the company gets a good tool to attract and retain customers, as well as a source of additional income at the expense of the dealer commission.  The company can brand SIM-cards and packaging, gets access to the admin panel statistics.  Payment acceptance, technical support and the network name are on the side of the partner operator HNO (Hosting Network Operator - roughly speaking, the host of the radio network).  This scheme is suitable for those who are interested in providing communication services for customers, but do not really want to bother with the technical side of the issue: communication salons, travel companies, retail chains, retail, insurance companies and so on. <br><br>  <a href="http://tottoli-gsm.com/ru/pro-mvno.html"><b>Pro MVNO</b></a> is a solution for companies with their own advanced PBX and using it, for example, for communication between employees and departments.  In addition, such a network can be used for niche offers: migrants, students, volunteers of large-scale events, etc. ... Pro MVNO provides significant opportunities. <br><br><ul><li>  Own traffic and converged traffic (SIP + GSM).  A company can simultaneously take advantage of mobile communications and IP telephony. <br><br></li><li>  Develop your own tariff plans.  The only limitation is the framework established by the HNO billing system (in our case, Tottoli GSM).  Billing is a system responsible for collecting and processing data in telecommunications.  Tariffing and pricing schemes are also taken into account in billing, therefore, when developing tariffs, it is worth considering its features.  However, it is difficult to go beyond the framework - modern billing systems are flexible and functional. <br><br></li><li>  The ability to create mechanisms for calculating with subscribers.  There are two main mechanisms: prepaid (the subscriber paid and uses the connection) and postpaded (the subscriber used the services and paid at the end of the period).  In the case of Pro MVNO, the company can choose the most appropriate option for itself or combine both. <br><br></li><li>  Own technical support.  On the one hand, this incurs additional costs, and on the other, it provides opportunities.  First of all, it is an opportunity to accumulate knowledge about subscribers and a way to implement information and some marketing initiatives. <br><br></li><li> Manage routing and directions.  This is necessary for companies wishing to merge, for example, branches or groups of subscribers and to form tariffs for them by directions. </li></ul><br>  HNO gives the owner of a virtual operator the right to assign a name to the network (for example, by brand name).  Payment acceptance is carried out on the side of MVNO, admin panel is provided (billing + statistics). <br>  This option is suitable for companies that are ready and able to be responsible for administering a virtual network and use all the listed benefits.  These are banks, large enterprises and holdings with an extensive network of branches, companies that provide fixed-line services and want to keep subscribers and receive additional income. <br><br>  <a href="http://tottoli-gsm.com/ru/full-mvno.html"><b>Full MVNO</b></a> is aimed at a corporate client seeking to build its business processes on the basis of communication.  For example, it may be the owners of mobile payment services or fixed-line operators.  If you turn to the global MVNO, you can find many examples where virtual operators often became competitors to the largest players in the cellular communications market, for example, winning low prices and aggressive marketing to a youth audience.  There were cases that the mobile operators themselves created MVNOs to enter the closed market or retain their disloyal subscribers. <br><br>  In addition to the above advantages of Pro MVNO, the company receives additional features. <br><br><ul><li>  Creation and use of applets for SIM-cards - independent small programs that extend the functionality of a SIM-card.  For example, it is applets that turn a SIM card into a means of payment. <br><br></li><li>  Full control of services and tariffs, the use of API. <br><br></li><li>  Assigning your own pool of numbers.  The company sets its numbering plan, can manage the connection, create virtual numbers. <br><br></li><li>  The use of FMC (converged communication), which allows you to create a telecommunications infrastructure with short access numbers within the company. </li></ul><br>  In fact, a full-fledged MVNO is being formed - a mobile communication operator with tariffs, number base, billing, operating as HNO, but without its own radio network. <br><br>  <a href="http://tottoli-gsm.com/ru/">Tottoli GSM</a> helps develop MVNO using a combination of VoIP technology and classic GSM.  The cost of calls is reduced, and this guarantees the possibility of forming low prices for communications, including in roaming, which is often infinitely expensive and causes the termination of the contract between the subscriber and the operator. <br><br>  Today, many business processes are tied to IP telephony.  But there is a small feature that the company faces sooner or later - VoIP is starting to be missed.  And this is due primarily to mobility.  Therefore, the creation of one of the MVNO types is a reasonable solution for building a telecommunications and IT infrastructure aimed at optimizing processes and intensive development. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266627/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266627/</a></p>
