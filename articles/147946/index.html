  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Subscriber safety - the work of the subscribers themselves, even for money?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When receiving phishing SMS, I myself usually contact Beeline voice support service to inform them of the sender's phone number.  The other day, a friend complained that he had already received several times (including at night) SMS from a ‚Äúfederal‚Äù number with a short link to ‚ÄúPhoto by Natasha‚Äù.  I advised to contact Beeline in support.  And today I learned an amusing continuation of the story. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A friend did not call for support, because he did not want to listen to the voice menu for half an hour, but wrote there by e-mail to questions.msk@beeline.ru. <br><br>  The description of the problem was extremely brief: <br><blockquote>  I come from the number <b>+79529230207</b> SMS of fraudulent / advertising content, offering to follow the link <a href="http://goo.gl/nj9fa">goo.gl/nj9fa</a> </blockquote><br>  But the answer (by the way - for some reason from the Voronezh branch) was unexpected: <br><blockquote>  Dear Customer! <br><br>  Thank you for taking the time to write to us.

      Answering your question, we want to inform you that our company is committed to <br>  provide a wide range of services that meet the requirements of our customers. <br>  Therefore, at the moment there is a service in the Company that <b>blocks debiting</b> <b><br></b>  <b>for paid services of</b> content providers - " <b>Blacklist</b> ". <br><br>  It is possible to install blacklists through the toll free number 0858. <br>  You can set the following restrictions: <br>  1. SMS service costing more than 50 rubles;  2. Restrict access to all <br>  paid SMS services, but leave the opportunity to receive messages from banks and <br>  trading networks use free services;  3. Completely <br>  block both paid and free sms-services of content providers;  four. <br>  Remove all previously established restrictions. <br><br>  We will be glad to answer your questions by email. <br>  questions.vrn@beeline.ru. <br><br>  We wish you all the best! <br><br>  Your "Beeline". <br></blockquote><br>  That is, instead of the usual ‚Äúthank you for the message, the sender's phone number will be transferred to the security service,‚Äù the dialogue with the support service turned into a proposal for a paid (?) Service that is very remotely related to the problem the client addressed. <br><br>  An extremely ironic situation, considering that for the short link that was in the SMS, at first glance no Trojan replanting or something like that occurs, just cheat someone's counter from LiveInternet, although the script is <a href="http://pix.nmi.com.ua/pix.php">pix.nmi.com.ua/pix .php</a> , called via the img tag, can filter the user-agent (I checked this page in the desktop Opera), and the cellular operator itself, as a result, offers a useless (?) service in this case. <br><br>  UPD: Obviously, in the text of the letter there is some kind of erroneous coincidence.  The fact is that Beeline has two services: " <a href="">Blacklist</a> " (for unwanted calls, paid) and " <a href="">Black and white lists</a> " (for blocking paid services).  At the same time, both, judging by their descriptions on the Beeline website, do not solve the problem that the client turned to support - <i>they do not eliminate the receipt of unwanted SMS from a private spammer with a federal number</i> . <br><br>  UPD2: For the minus made a selection and links to descriptions of services. <br><br>  UPD3: I will take out comments.  If a person is used to using a site for managing services, and not a short number, then under the name ‚ÄúBlack List‚Äù, which is mentioned in the letter, he will find a paid service that has no relation to SMS at all.  In the worst case scenario (a certain amount of carelessness), he will lose several rubles: 3 rubles for adding one number and 1 ruble multiplied by the number of days through which he will find that the service does not do what is necessary. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147946/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147946/</a></p>
