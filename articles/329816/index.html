  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Job prospects for Java programmers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Our educational project started with the <a href="http://otus.ru/lessons%3Fcourse%3D1%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Daffilate%26utm_campaign%3D30.05%26utm_term%3Dmain">Java Developer</a> program not by chance.  In many ways, the emergence of this course is associated with the growth rate of the IT sphere and the constant demand for qualified programmers.  In this article, we decided to share with you the numbers and facts that confirm our choice and help you understand whether to study Java at a professional level. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why java? <br><br>  The TIOBE portal, which makes up a monthly ranking of languages ‚Äã‚Äãbased on queries in popular search engines, has not changed the leader for a year.  And yes, it is Java.  Information on it is searched on average 2 times more often than in C, 4 times more often than in Python and 6.5 times more often than in Swift.  And the point is not that Java is a complex language or there is little good documentation on it.  Over the 22 years of its existence, this language has created around itself a whole ecosystem that develops from year to year, which complicates the search for the right educational sources and tools.  However, this is no longer a problem. <br><br>  Java is an incredibly developed and sought-after programming language, as evidenced by its almost unlimited scope.  You can bend your fingers:

      1. Mobile development - the most popular Android OS in the world is running Java.  Do not forget about J2ME-applications for the budget segment; <br>  2. Web applications - it's hard to even imagine how many mobile versions of websites are written in Java; <br>  3. Desktop software - the widest range of applications from games (Minecraft) to office programs (Open Office).  For embedded systems, Java also fits flawlessly; <br>  4. Financial field - such giants as Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs actively use Java for internal electronic systems and as a tool for creating custom applications; <br>  5. Big data is a very relevant today direction related to processing, forecasting and modeling information. <br><br>  What do the numbers say? <br><br>  According to the portal trud.com in Russia, Java developers need more than C / C ++ / C # developers or, for example, PHP specialists, not to mention Python, Ruby or Swift.  Similar statistics can be found on other HR portals, for example, hh.ru. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cc4/cb4/7fe/cc4cb47fe07b4859833d146291a33262.png"><br><br>  Having mastered the Java language and the accompanying tools, you can successfully start a career outside of Russia, because the need for professional personnel is no less there than in our country.  So, according to the information of the portal Codingdojo, in 2017, Java is located on the second place in the list of the most popular languages, losing leadership only to SQL.  According to the publication, to date, about 90% of the companies from the Fortune 500 list (the world's 500 largest companies) use Java to develop the backend in their systems. <br><br>  To be fair, it's worth noting that the need for JavaScript programmers is slightly higher than for Java developers.  However, the level of wages is lower there, and the range of tasks to be solved is already there. <br><br>  Speaking of salaries.  Guess, programmers with knowledge of which programming language have the highest average salary?  And this is Java again.  Here are the numbers: A Java developer who graduated from a university in a specialty or simply having one year of experience behind him can easily count on 50-70 thousand rubles of salary.  Having accumulated experience and knowledge, he is already applying for a salary of 70-100 thousand rubles.  Further, only incrementally: from 3 years of experience - up to 150 thousand, from 5 years - 200 thousand, and tmlids and seniors can find an official salary from 200 to 300 thousand rubles. <br><br>  If you look at the statistics throughout Russia, the situation will not change much.  According to trud.com, the Java developer‚Äôs average salary was 90 thousand rubles.  It is important to note that these statistics do not include team leaders and department heads. <br><br>  The world trends in this regard are repeated by the Russian ones: for example, according to TechWorm information, in 2016, the list of the most ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù and sought-after languages ‚Äã‚Äãwas headed by Java.  The leading developer of this specialty in the United States earns an average of 115 thousand dollars a year.  Similar numbers can be found in Switzerland, a little lower in Germany or Canada.  Essentially, this does not change - Java programmers live well in any country. <br><br>  What about competition? <br><br>  It exists everywhere where big money dwells.  Qualitative Java-specialists are now in the market deficit.  This is indirectly confirmed by the CMS Magazine and Runet Rating study, in which 62% of web development companies complained about the lack of people to complete their tasks.  As we all understand, this is not about web designers and web designers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/38a/348/e2c/38a348e2c5da4ccba801afd144750f02.png"><br><br>  Here we come to the main question: ‚ÄúWhere to get a quality education?‚Äù.  Our team from otus.ru made every effort to program the <a href="http://otus.ru/lessons%3Fcourse%3D1%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Daffilate%26utm_campaign%3D30.05%26utm_term%3Dmain">Java Developer</a> course. <br><br>  It was useful to our students not only from the point of view of new knowledge, but also from the point of view of meeting the requirements of employer companies for middle and early senior jobs.  We guarantee the best graduates an interview for vacant positions with our partners - top IT companies.  Come to us to study and discover new career prospects, gaining invaluable knowledge. <br><br>  By the way, the <a href="http://otus.ru/lessons%3Fcourse%3D1%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Daffilate%26utm_campaign%3D30.05%26utm_term%3Dnewgroup">new Java group is</a> starting its training this Saturday! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329816/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329816/</a></p>
