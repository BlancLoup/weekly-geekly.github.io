Own view</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Hundreds of visitors, dozens of companies and studios, numerous, eye-catching stands and monitors, first-class reports.  Yes, this is a CG Event - a meeting place for all those involved in the virtual world of graphics.  Artists, modelers, visualizers, animators and other creative people for two days shared their experiences, and simply communicated. <br><br>  And I was there, honey-beer drank ... Phew ... I absorbed a lot of information with all the pores of the gray matter, that unique spirit of professionalism and many interesting ideas.  This will be further discussed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0e/878/783/b0e8787837b2415a9a6110d6eb052bad.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      What is the most difficult thing in such an event, you think, to get?  A day on the train, with two transfers - this is for me, and in fact some people came from more distant edges. <br><br>  The geography of the participants is very extensive.  Of course, most of the visitors were from Moscow, since it was the conference that was held there, but also people from neighboring regions, neighboring countries, and even from the other half of the globe arrived.  Passing in the lobby, one could hear not only Russian, but also English and, as it seemed to me, German. <br><br>  In general, at the beginning of the conference a lot of interesting ‚Äúpyrogograms‚Äù were shown.  These diagrams displayed the mass of compiled information from the questionnaires that all participants filled out during registration: gender, weight, height, preferences ... just kidding. <br><br>  Most of the questions related to professional preferences, equipment used, some skills.  Of course, it was not without podkvyrok.  For example, one of the questions read: ‚ÄúWhat operating system do you use?  Options: Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, hard to answer. ‚Äù  Strangely enough, a certain percentage of the participants responded with the last option, which led to the natural delight of the audience and laughter.  There was an atmosphere of some kind of ease, freedom, and, despite the number of prominent industry masters, I quickly felt among my own.  I believe that most participants had such feelings. <br><br>  I will return to my question, but what is the most difficult thing about such an event?  The most difficult thing was to decide where to go, what report to visit, how to properly allocate your time.  As advised by the main manager of the party, the inspirer and simply cool people Sergey Tsyptsyn: "Break into small pieces, you expect a lot of interesting things."  Personally, I was able to stay only on the first day of the two, which lasted the conference, but it was unforgettable. <br><br>  The reports came one after the other, from morning to deep evening and moreover, in parallel at once in nine streams.  It was hard to decide.  And although, in just a few days, a plan of the event was posted on the website of the organizers, in the lobby, on chairs, or just on the floor, you could see visitors strenuously studying the conference program.  An amazing thing, despite such a tight schedule of speakers, people found time to chat, turn around at interesting stands, touch the exhibits with their hands and even participate in any real-time show.  Indeed, it was to look at that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4da/737/9bd/4da7379bd5f94331b292ba96324cc500.jpg"><br>  What do you think the dude saw on the ceiling? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf7/8bf/a5f/bf78bfa5f4184b94af42fcb996dd12cc.jpg"><br>  And this one is staring at where? <br><br>  In general, the ‚Äúattraction‚Äù of virtual devices was very popular.  "Points" clearly did not lie.  Sinful business and I wanted to fly a dragon, but I remembered in time about the weak vestibular apparatus.  Having seen enough of the people, taking off the helmet from the head and shook their heads crazy, he changed his mind.  And yet, it must have been cool.  Next time, if possible, I will definitely try the virtual world in reality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50f/849/0b6/50f8490b6e324d0aaa5aaeab742da6d6.jpg"><br>  It looks weird, but the filling is cool <br><br>  This stand stood out among all some kind of old, giving off the smell of radio bulbs incandescent.  Nearby was a piece of landscape with a tank layout.  You know, doing such things in circles ‚Äúcrazy hands‚Äù.  Children with mentors restore entire panoramas of battles.  This only inflamed my interest and I approached the owners with a legitimate question: ‚ÄúWTF !?‚Äù It turned out that this stand was the creators of a domestic film, which was notable for collecting money for the whole world.  However, this fact is not interesting.  Now in the production of films dominated by the use of 3D graphics.  Here the guys resorted to the combined shooting.  And here is just the manipulator in the photo is the main acting ‚Äúface‚Äù, or rather the eye.  Actually, this is a simple industrial robot, programmed for a special sequence of actions.  And further, the ingenious rendering mechanism was turned on almost in real time. <br><br>  In general, it was funny to look at the throwing of the ‚Äúarm‚Äù of the manipulator and the operator, who flipped with some kind of toggle switches of a very prehistoric appearance.  In the window of a small screen, the size of an oscilloscope, there was a further rendering process, when a picture was painted layer by layer.  And here is the apotheosis - through a special lens it was possible to view the finished result, and in the three-dimensional image! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f06/c2c/43c/f06c2c43cbd24a84b7528499c311ab91.jpg"><br><br>  However, the main value of such an event is people and reports.  A lot of interesting things sounded in different halls and, unfortunately, it was impossible to burst.  For myself, I identified several directions that interested me.  By virtue of their activities (I am an indie game developer) and the tools used, three main planes emerged: Open Source, 2D and Games.  I had to carefully plan my time to catch the necessary reports.  I must say, I did not regret the time spent, most of the material was really useful for me and more on that ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/345/edc/307/345edc30798c443bb18bbb11d81851b7.jpg"><br><br>  2D, vector, sketch - how much sense in these words.  No game can do without them.  That's just the problem, in 2D I am almost zero.  I can't draw, my maximum is vector buttons in Inkscape or Illustrator.  Therefore, I planned to visit at least one report on this topic: ‚ÄúTo be or not to be.  Inkscape game graphics. ‚Äù  Sounds intriguing. <br><br>  The speaker spoke about her experience in using the free Inkscape editor specifically for creating game elements: characters and even tiles.  Actually the second moment interested me more.  It turns out that there is a plug-in in the Internet with the characteristic name Tiler, which allows you to create seamless drawings and correctly place the blocks.  Inkscape can do it himself, but Tiler looks more comfortable.  In fact, this is a mini-editor.  The truth is there is one small problem, according to the speaker, this plugin is being finalized and is not available in the program repository.  It is necessary to wait, rather useful tool will turn out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/571/9c8/d4c/5719c8d4c6f9466aa031f945332dbe94.jpg"><br><br>  Blend4Web is a framework on which I have high hopes in my game development plans.  This is a cool tool that allows you to visualize three-dimensional graphics on web pages (WebGL) and is based on the use of Blender.  Take Blender, create a scene and simply export.  Yes, this is how you can quickly get 3D on the site.  And from the speakers, I expected to hear a lot of interesting things. <br><br>  Several reports, several different topics: from optimization for the web to the development of the game.  Did you know that using Blend4Web, you can take a screenshot of any resolution without resizing the browser window?  I did not know, and many listeners did not know either.  But it is enough to move the slider in the application settings, press the corresponding key and reset the image to disk.  This can be useful, for example, for printing purposes. <br><br>  There were also other useful tips on how to optimize graphics, features of working with Blender nodes, creating logic, and interface.  But most of all I was interested in the report on the development of the game on Blend4Web. <br><br>  Yes, yes, it was at CG Event that the b4w developers announced the beginning of the development of a full-fledged game on their engine.  And with the opening source. <br><br>  The project was visually very attractive, at least the part that was shown on the stand.  Physics, qualitative environment, parallaxes, particles revived the created world.  With the help of the basic functions of the engine, the change of night and day, swinging trees under the wind, refractions and reflections in water surfaces were implemented.  Interestingly, the game is absolutely not slowed down on the stand, despite the fact that the monitor was 4k and this is WebGL.  It looked just great! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/baf/9a8/7eb/baf9a87eba1848349437378ea8f28a9e.jpg"><br><br>  Everybody knows that flash died safely, a really gaping hole reigned, which WebGL began to fill in feverishly.  And the appearance of a new player on this scene is very important.  That is how I regard the report on the creation of the game on Blend4Web.  It seems that the developers of the engine are seriously concerned about this direction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea9/91d/0c5/ea991d0c525e4028af5440e30a1ba0aa.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, I could not but visit reports related to Blender, because this is the main tool in my work. <br><br>  I was most interested in the story of Mira Tools - these are the increasingly popular retopes and modeling tools created by a programmer from St. Petersburg.  Who uses Blender, he will understand what is at stake.  Yes, the program has a set of basic features for performing the actions that Mira Tools offers, but it really turned out to be a very convenient tool. <br><br>  The Mira Tools package offers several interesting features.  For example, extruding polygons parallel to the existing surface in automatic mode.  Practically you draw without worrying about the correct placement of elements, literally with the mouse movement.  Or a tool that distorts the shape of an object, like Twist, Bend, and others.  Only this is done in an example easier than using the standard Blender modifier. <br><br>  Another interesting tool in the package is the Curve Guide.  By changing the shape of the auxiliary splines, you can edit the mesh.  This flexible and convenient tool allows you to easily create a three-dimensional model from a blank in accordance with the existing sketch.  Mira Tools is really a worthwhile package that will greatly facilitate the work of the modeler. <br><br>  I told only about a small part of the conference and I regret very much that I could not attend the rest of the reports.  There were many interesting things, there were famous people from cool studios.  Motion Capture, the creators of visual effects from the films ‚ÄúAvengers‚Äù, ‚ÄúHitmen‚Äù, ‚ÄúHe is a dragon‚Äù, lectures on compositing remained behind.  Break, alas, did not work.  Hopefully, they will post other reports on the CG Event and it will be possible to look at the conference from a different angle. <br><br>  As the organizer, inspirer and part-time Sergey Tsyptsyn said: ‚ÄúThe CG Event is first of all the Meeting Place for all those who are involved in computer graphics or are interested in digital art‚Äù. <br><br>  See you at the next event! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367275/</a></p>
