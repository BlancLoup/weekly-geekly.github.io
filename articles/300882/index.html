All your creativity has evaporated, as if, and it was not her ... <br>  Work on content marketing was moving its course, but now all the ideas are over, and it became impossible to read this boring story. <br>  All those materials that were interesting to users, evoked bright emotions in them, now have become a faceless block of text. <br>  What to do? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  <b>1. Refuse to blog.</b> </h5><br>  Maybe it's time to stop?  If your blog is boring and dull, then there is no point in keeping it.

On the contrary, try something new, be inspired by the GoPro site, their concept cannot be called a blog in the generally accepted sense.  But their site is filled with lively and interesting information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c7/43c/111/2c743c111e434255b53dc5a5f7d27b74.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>2. Take a video of your product</b> </h5><br>  Since we started talking about GoPro and video, it‚Äôs impossible not to note the fact that the trends in content marketing are changing, but videos are always popular and loved by users, and also attract a lot of attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78d/5ab/a88/78d5aba88aaf46dab31f307d9c1b738c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Ask why?  And because with their realism they immerse the user completely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8f/339/b51/a8f339b516c247c4893e7f2f7e0f5789.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Give them the right to live, and you will see that the videos you might like very much and become one of the favorite tools of content marketing. <br><br><h5>  <b>3. Start using Twitter hashtags</b> </h5><br>  Twitter is a great example of fun optimization.  How does he work? <br>  With Twitter, everything becomes instant: instant content, interaction, posting, visibility, likes and retweets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5d/dde/c58/a5dddec583dd434f96b667f623c61f38.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In this instant environment, the content can be anything, but not boring.  By starting to use hashtags in your marketing campaign, you can come up with and start something more, something that will attract your users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1bd/a36/e25/1bda36e25b4e4c3d9400ff8e54b7b508.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>4. Organize an informal meeting</b> </h5><br>  Sitting in your office all day, you can hardly be inspired and come up with something interesting.  Try to organize a small party for buyers and colleagues.  Real people will come hang out, have a beer and get to know each other. <br><br>  With the help of such a party your content will turn from static - into lively and dynamic. <br><br><h5>  <b>5. Do not be afraid to experiment, try a new platform!</b> </h5><br>  Never used Pinterest?  So try it!  And what if it doesn't work out?  And it does not matter, the main thing is to start with something new. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/601/0a1/204/6010a1204dec4369bd91e45d9bce64a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Just understand that using the new platform will help to restructure your outdated thoughts a bit and give you fresh ideas for the platforms that already exist on your site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46d/121/168/46d121168fc84f7d9705e2e85df3bbfd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Who would have thought that a date for a barbel could be such a great idea. <br><br><h5>  <b>6. Come up with your chip</b> </h5><br>  What chip, for example?  Apply all the power of your imagination. <br>  Here is a joke with the cosmos invented by Red Bull. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/404/a0e/e25/404a0ee251be407ea53580a38abf8947.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What can you think of?  It depends on the specifics of your products / services and on the audience. <br><br>  Some creatives buy iPhones and then smash them in front of the amazed public. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xio8ms7keFU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgnMxM8vJSz0wmYVyqkkft8HsKN6Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Waste of money?  ‚ÄúPerhaps, but at least it attracts attention and certainly will not make you bored.‚Äù <br><br><h5>  <b>7. Rap</b> </h5><br>  ‚ÄúRappers are real content marketers,‚Äù wrote one of the authors of the newspaper Observer. <br>  Maybe, like Jay-Z, you will fail, but can you try? <br>  HubSpot, for example, did this. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mkhN4L7Mn74%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhizvBV1kDSUvcc6XRRdPJ0TifMM1A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Well, let it sound trite, but it's not boring, is it? <br><br><h5>  <b>8. Hire a new specialist</b> </h5><br>  It sounds tough, but such a shake will be useful for your company. <br>  Invite a new specialist to work.  Fresh blood in your organization can shake up all the usual things, give you some new ideas and breathe new, fun life into the content - and this is exactly what you need. <br><br><h5>  <b>9. Take an example from competitors.</b> </h5><br>  Have you ever thought about stealing a couple of ideas from competitors? <br>  No, I do not propose to do something that would violate copyright laws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b72/bc4/4c6/b72bc44c677d4cddb5013bffacee9acf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I just suggest looking at what your competitors are doing.  Perhaps their approach will help some new ideas appear in your head, and they will later grow into something more and fill with their own exclusive content. <br><br><h5>  <b>10. Share Free Stuff</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/893/161/fa2/893161fa214a4e998ae1aabe9323aa9a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Provide your audience with free resources.  All users love it.  Even if the content itself runs out and becomes boring, the concept will remain.  By providing free resources, you can upgrade your marketing campaign and make your materials more interesting by moving to a whole new level. <br><br><h5>  <b>11. Immerse yourself in the subject.</b> </h5><br>  One of the areas for which content marketers are fighting is the depth and credibility of site content. <br><br>  This is what I mean: there is a lot of useful information on the Internet, but, unfortunately, a lot of things are repeated.  The information with which you fill your site is no different from what competitors A, B, C wrote on their blogs. <br><br>  You definitely do not want this.  How to make your content different from everyone else, how to interest readers?  You will improve it by delving into the topic. <br><br>  When you start digging deeply into the topic, with all its exciting nuances, entanglement, plunging into the terminology of disagreement, you will get readers who are interested much deeper than simple passersby.  These are the readers you want.  They are fully loaded and ready to sell for your information. <br><br>  Will it be boring for someone?  May be.  But will it be boring for the truly interested?  Is not a fact! <br><br><ul><li>  Step 1: Find decent content. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Step 2: Delve into the specifics and make it even better. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Step 3: Connect with the right audience </li></ul><br><br>  The truth is: ‚Äúnothing is new under the sun,‚Äù and this expression applies to content marketers, but at least you can try to do something better under the sun. <br><br><h5>  <b>12. Pay attention to the length</b> </h5><br>  Deep immersion is great, but the length of the content is important too. <br>  Often with a deep immersion in the subject, the length of the content increases. <br>  For several years, it was the long forms that were personally preferable to me.  I often write blog posts that are thousands of words long.  My manuals are super long, almost like books. <br><br>  The length of the content has a positive effect on him, so he has a higher ranking in the search engines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f5/b1c/6f3/5f5b1c6f302c4ddeb5016472d45c2b34.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I do not recommend you write long texts for their length.  It is worth writing long and in detail just because the topic is interesting. <br><br>  This seems contradictory, but remember the point I described earlier: long content will attract the right and necessary readers. <br><br>  Someone likes to quickly run on the topic, but others - to dive into the issue with his head. <br><br><h5>  <b>13. Use more pictures.</b> </h5><br>  Here I explain very briefly: if you do not use images in your blog, it becomes dry, lifeless and dull. <br>  Add images, dilute the text and you will attract the interest of readers. <br><br><h5>  <b>14. Invite a celebrity who will approve and support your product.</b> </h5><br>  I'm not saying that you should immediately invite Tom Hanks, no. <br>  Each industry has its own experts.  For example, you have never heard of Pipa Lai, but in general he is considered the god of conversion optimization in the USA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a04/ee9/71c/a04ee971c24f40a2810e27ad6f90e698.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And who is a celebrity in your industry?  Until this person becomes your competitor, you can get an interview, approval, or just a friendly pat on the back, if you need it. <br><br><h5>  <b>15. Announce a contest for a headline.</b> </h5><br>  Attach your readers to your site, let them participate.  A simple call ‚Äúthink up a name for this photo‚Äù can turn your bored readers into impatient participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d1/e88/859/0d1e8885992a4f3c8070864c0c94a6a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h5><br>  The boring content of the site dampens the reader‚Äôs interest and scares away your brand.  To change this situation you have to do a little more than just use active verbs and make words in italics. <br>  You will need to do something completely new. <br>  Perhaps my simple recommendations will push you to a fresh idea. <br><br>  Subscribe to our blog, then there will be a lot of interesting things. <br><br>  Sincerely yours, <a href="http://yambox.net/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  ( <a href="http://yambox.net/">Yambox</a> - turn your online store into a computer game) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300882/</a></p>
