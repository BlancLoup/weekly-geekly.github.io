  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IBM and BMW - cars will be able to work with information in real time</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/abd/c15/150/abdc1515046949778caeae61cd0bd4f0.jpg"><br><br>  In cars, more and more sensors, sensors, cameras, wireless communication modules and other elements appear.  And the smarter the car becomes, the more data it generates.  Modern models of smart cars from different manufacturers together generate tens of gigabytes of data per hour.  Soon this amount of information will increase to terabytes.  But the information in our time is gold, the data is literally becoming more valuable (you can ask Google, Amazon, Facebook about this). <br><br>  Therefore, thoroughness of data processing is now at the forefront.  BMW is working with IBM to create a specialized automotive platform.  She already has a name - CarData.  The partners' goal is to create a system that could process the data generated by smart cars.  And this data, in turn, would be useful for car manufacturers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last year, IBM <a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/51237.wss">began work</a> on a similar project with General Motors Co.  All this will allow companies to provide better cars and related services, and car owners to get more relevant data in accordance with their own interests and the relevance of information.  During the trip, for example, the driver will be able to receive data on the condition of the car and its individual systems in real time.

      The seemingly minor problem can cause major problems in a few days.  And if you don‚Äôt know about this problem in time, you can lose time, money, and the car itself. <br><br>  IBM plans to eventually create an information hub where data from smart cars from a wide range of manufacturers will be collected, as well as information that the manufacturers themselves send.  All this will allow motorists to receive timely services.  For example, if you need to replace some part, the owner of the car makes an order right out of the car during the trip, and the nearest auto repair shop or parts store is already preparing this part.  The customer arrives - and the part is ready for installation. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cZ_ZUR3IF3s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The same with insurance companies that will receive information in real time.  The car of the insurer's client got into an accident - immediately a repairman with a tow truck goes on the road, the relevant documents are prepared. <br><br>  Data is processed using the Watson IoT system, which is used as a tool for analyzing data and identifying the relationship between them. <br><br>  As for CarData, there are already data from 8.5 million BMW cars and program partners, including suppliers of fuel, spare parts, insurance and other services.  All this works on the basis of the cloud platform Bluemix.  Now several large car manufacturers from Europe are interested in it.  The contract for work in the framework of the CarData project was signed by 10 different service providers.  While there are no insurance companies among them, but this is only a matter of time. <br><br>  According to a <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170613006441/en/Top-5-Vendors-Automotive-Connected-Car-Platform">number of analysts</a> , the volume of the market of "connected" cars is constantly expanding, by about 11% per year.  By 2021, this figure will be $ 8.47 billion. And many companies are already starting to work on achieving similar results.  Among others, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù technologies for cars are engaged in Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Google and AT &amp; T. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370639/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370639/</a></p>
