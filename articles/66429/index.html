Social network for gamers and even such a scale that just captures the spirit, and at the same time a collective blog, so you can characterize the project.  I'm on a gamer from the very beginning of his beta test and therefore I see that the site is growing by leaps and bounds. <br>  During this time, users have come running up (and many have done this even before the official opening, asking for beta testing) overgrown with blogs and posts.  Now the numbers on the main make it clear how serious it is.  Yesterday and 10,000 users did not exist, today it is about 15 thousand.  And why?  Because it is interesting and gamer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5d/3f8/049/e5d3f8049898134c9f2f84371be08e43.jpg" alt="Sheep in action" align="right">  From the very start, users were frightened / attracted by an RPG system that developed step by step and already has 17 ‚Äúspells‚Äù for everyone who grows up to them.  By the way, one of the gamers' favorite spells is Sheep: in the victim's comments, the text is changed to bleating for an hour, and the avatar is replaced with the image of a sheep.  Is it <br>  can you skip this by yourself if you are a real gamer? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/acc/10c/516/acc10c516af034fa62e747147f6da73c.jpg" alt="And this is me and my abilities" align="left">  Growth in levels as it should be for writing posts, comments and simply outstanding actions on <a href="http://gamer.ru/">Gamer.ru</a> (for posts more, for comments less, for excellent posts as expected - in general in large quantities), so blogs are not as boring as they could be because the community assesses them, and the community wants to read only the most interesting and high-quality (and the fact that everything is written not for money adds its own zest and doesn‚Äôt spoil the posts that more than 13,000 have already run up and during the writing of this text added about ten  ).

      Where gamers are good, the publisher is good too.  1C, Soft Club, New Disc, Akella, TVX Media, Buka, Q1 - have already sneaked onto the project and are watching what is happening, sharing secret data and conducting various entertainment events.  Not so long ago, at the initiative of users, there was a rather long contest on the knowledge of games, speed and ingenuity, a blog contest, a contest for the best mockery of an avatar, even a <s>mushroom</s> contest <s>(canceled yesterday)</s> of desktops - everyone will find interesting for himself, and if he also likes large publishers and developers, the prizes, respectively, become really expensive and alluring. <br>  Day after day, hour after hour, the project is creeping towards development.  Each update adds more fun, RPG and amenities in the interface.  Because  resource gaming, then even the spells on the site appeared before the logo was approved (it is expected that it will appear during the next update). <br>  The audience is huge, everything develops quickly and it is terrible to think how many people will appear in the fall, when it is time for vacations and the hot sun will no longer drive people away from the monitors.  If you have always wanted to participate in the creation of a dream site about games - <a href="http://gamer.ru/">welcome to the gamer's party</a> .  There will be welcome both the audience and any active people with their creative ideas and interesting posts. <br>  <b>UPD:</b> All gamers abruptly decided to <a href="http://www.gamer.ru/games/846-obo-vsem/posts/14666">rush to the party with the "New Disc"</a> <br>  <b>UPD 2:</b> Habrasoobshchestvo (it can not be that everyone was so sad), or just the habrachiteli were quite mediocre writers, therefore I remind everyone who is interested in the project that you can read the <a href="http://www.gamer.ru/recommended">recommended posts</a> , then <a href="http://www.gamer.ru/pages/help_about">mini-help</a> and <a href="http://www.gamer.ru/games/846-obo-vsem/posts/13684">more extensive help</a> , and then write .  All the same, your ‚Äúworks in 1 line‚Äù will be deleted and no one will read them.  Agreed? <br>  <b>UPD 3: The</b> wave of incomprehensible evil newcomers was asleep, <s>karma was almost normalized,</s> some recruits even managed to write something worthwhile and I hope in the coming days the most creative of them will write something that will be really interesting to read.  Thanks to such people in advance.  And on the gamer (perhaps because of the lack of minuses), the atmosphere is still a bit kinder, even if habr and gamer are two completely different projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66429/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66429/</a></p>
