Bug work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After an experimental scam with an <a href="http://ilovecinema.ru/">aylevsinema</a> that ended last summer, I turned off the internet for a while, searching with interest from the inside how a regular commercial bank works.  A trip to the banking sector would be very exciting if the world financial crisis had not been the case.  But even without it, it is worth noting that working at a bank, even project, is a rather routine task. <br><br>  At the end of last autumn, once again exploring the <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/">Poster</a> site for inventing what to build, develop and improve (and there is a lot of it), I suddenly came across such a moment that there are areas that still dominate ‚ÄúManual‚Äù search by the consumer of a suitable option with active use of the phone.  On objectivity of the same Poster it was clearly visible with restaurants and ordering tables in them. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The standard Internet design response to a user request for navigation in a certain area is obviously known: collecting all the items into one heap and: lists, sorting, ratings, discussions, news, etc.  For example, <a href="http://www.banki.ru/">banki.ru</a> .  By the way, if anyone knows an equally developed website on the insurance industry, especially auto, tell me - I would be extremely grateful.

      I wanted to do a more clever thing: not a comparative search service, but a comparative ordering service.  And just then a taxi came into its own, in which, at least sometimes, the question of the optimal choice is generally inferior to the need for the best choice now from what is available.  A person needs to leave now, he calls one taxi station, they say, ‚ÄúIn an hour.‚Äù - ‚ÄúNo, this is a long time,‚Äù the other calls, ‚ÄúThe car will be in one and a half.‚Äù - He also refuses, calls back to the first, and they can only send a car there in two hours.  The situation, of course, is model, but quite real, judging by the reviews of some friends. <br><br>  As a result, despite the hasty and artisan approach, the working prototype was implemented: <br>  <a href="http://sprositaxi.ru/">sprositaxi.ru</a> <br>  Send an order, get offers from different taxis (in which, they indicate not only the tariff and time of submission, but also the brand model of the car), choose what you like more - and then, as usual, - you drive. <br>  You can try it by the way. <br><br>  It turned out to be amusing to realize this not only via the Internet, but also through ordinary text messages.  Initially, I thought it would be the most difficult aspect, but it turned out that the SMS services sector is very well developed infrastructurally, and the tasks in this area are outsourced for reasonable money without any problems. <br><br>  In the legal-accounting part, the most unpleasantly surprising was the fact that it is very difficult to be a legal entity without having an actual office.  And if with a tax it is somehow decided by a guarantee letter - the intention to rent an office in the future, then for an elementary opening of a settlement account in a bank, you have to arrange a mini-show with a kind of work in an office. <br><br>  In conditions of a very limited budget, a situation where a person with the necessary competence is ready to work in a project for a share is, of course, very pleased.  But here I did not take into account the simple, seemingly simple moment: the share in an LLC is an asset of the same type as money.  And if the money is paid for the actual work done, and done well and on time, then with the share you need to do the same, especially if this specialist does not plan to participate in this project as the main occupation for himself. <br><br>  Cool, that we have competitors - <a href="http://taximer.ru/">taximer.ru</a> <br>  The guys started at the beginning of May, a month before us, and it‚Äôs funny that they went to the same goal as we, directly from the opposite side - first implementing the informational and communicative layers, putting the service one for later.  We are obviously inferior to them in advertising budget and development resources, so I allow myself a little bit of maliciously shameless criticism. <br><br>  It is unpleasantly surprising, with the seemingly declared visit to the full information coverage, the lack of relevant information on the tariffs of some companies.  It is clear, of course, that the ‚Äúchecked‚Äù and ‚Äúnot checked‚Äù icons are cool - some navigation convenience for users and the opportunity to receive additional money from taxi stations for this, but to constantly monitor and keep up to date all the information on the basis of which the claimed main works - comparison of tariffs - you need whatever the one who pays and how much.  I hope it will be worked out with them over time and normally maintained. <br><br>  One of the obvious problems of social service Internet projects, following from the very nature of the Internet, is the irresponsibility of the opinion of each individual user.  A typical approach to the removal of this problem is also quite obvious - the development of the community through the building of reputational hierarchical structures.  But in highly consumer and rigidly competitive areas - this approach becomes especially long and difficult and it is not at all the fact that it is true.  And in this regard, a more effective and realistic approach may be not ‚Äúhow to make the good appear‚Äù, but ‚Äúhow to limit the appearance of the bad‚Äù.  At least, it seems to me that it is in this direction that we should think, and for example, give an opportunity to comment on the quality of a product or service only to those about whom it is known that he tried this product or service (ordered it through the service provided). <br><br>  But in general, it is very curious how they implement and line up the ordering service itself. <br><br>  We‚Äôll see how we‚Äôll go on and on with us (we‚Äôre probably running out of money soon, we‚Äôll close, so take advantage of the opportunity to use the service while we‚Äôre still alive), there will probably be more similar projects (by the way, there are interesting projects of software associations like <a href="http://www.globaltaxi.ru/">globaltaxi.ru</a> , but this is less for customers, more for taxis themselves - therefore, rather a separate story) and in the end, I think, Anton Borisovich‚Äôs statement will not work in this particular area, and there‚Äôs not only enough space for everyone, then one who can fast  and it is better than others to implement all (it is quite foreseeable list). <br><br>  It is curious, by the way, that ideas similar in type penetrate into other spheres, for example, in tourism: <a href="http://putevki.ru/">putevki.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61752/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61752/</a></p>
