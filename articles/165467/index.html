  <section class="page js-page"><h1>City as a system: we design ourselves</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, habrayuzer. <br>  Somehow, about three years ago, walking around the center of St. Petersburg (myself from Yekaterinburg), I thought - why is the center of St. Petersburg at times more pleasant?  Compared with Moscow, Athens, other major cities ... I came to an intermediate conclusion that a person needs a place for walking and a broad perspective. <br><br>  The full conclusion was formed a little later, when we walked with a friend in our city.  He is a bit of a techie (in terms of interest in the exact sciences), but rather a musician and artist.  He talked about architecture: ‚ÄúOne cannot be combined with another!  Do they even look at the surrounding houses? ‚ÄùI thought about systemology or, when they do not speak about science, about the systems approach. <br>  Then a thought flashed through my head: ‚ÄúWhat if ... But why why if ?!  The city is a system, it needs to be designed, not developed as necessary. ‚Äù  I shared my thoughts with a friend.  He supported them.  It would all have been forgotten if it were not for the announcement of some kind of competition, which has already disappeared from the title. <br><br>  This is not important: we decided to analyze large cities and consider them as a system: what requirements are made, how they can be met, how one affects the other, and so on ... Who cares - welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <br>
      Of course, any work must begin with the formation of goals.  In our case - the requirements.  Hoping for the TK to such an object as to the city would be too naive, and therefore we went the other way.  We conducted a survey (all documents will be posted below), in which you, if you want, can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform%3Fformkey%3DdHBIempJRmRNeE5ZUXl0b3F3R1BzbXc6MQ">participate</a> .  The results of the survey, see below.  In addition, we decided to use the Maslow pyramid to form a general list of requirements for any human habitat.  They came up with something themselves, not without it.  Anyway, we found out that most people are not comfortable with the current situation radically. <br><br>  Started to work.  The emphasis was on modern technology.  Two years of surfing on cnews, cnet, popular science, MIT technological review, habrahabr and other sites - and my friend and I were able to identify those technologies that can really improve our lives.  To some extent, and influenced the article on Habr√© to create the perfect personal workplace. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfix was the desire of a person to improve their living environment and at the same time their unwillingness to work for someone in infrastructure.  That is, people are not against the installation of benches in the parks in which they rest, and at the same time they are not ready to work for the sake of this as they are not used by them, but, I apologize, the homeless.  There are many similar nuances and we simply could not physically take them into account. <br><br>  Then we decided to create a <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7BtTZOwsiPZLWIta1hoLXVfaGc/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">mental map</a> (the source code of the .mm format made in freemind: the raster is too large, but nobody eats the vector), highlighting the eight most important parameters of the city.  Things got better.  Immediately it became clear how to organize the infrastructure.  Three city schemes were drawn: <a href="">1</a> , <a href="">2</a> , <a href="">3</a> <br><br>  Well, then it remained for the small - to write the text.  Immediately I warn you, the text does not pretend to be scientific, since we wanted to convey the whole picture.  Further work on the details is possible if the community is interested. <br>  Community interested in?  The work is transferred to the public domain (CC0), so anyone can create. <br>  <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview%3Fid%3D0B7BtTZOwsiPZZWE5d2tiak53NVE%26usp%3Dsharing">drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7BtTZOwsiPZZWE5d2tiak53NVE&amp;usp=sharing</a> <br><br>  Now a few words, why do I need all this. <br>  I am a perfectionist.  That is, not really ... I think what can be done better than it is now.  But good, not perfect, but better.  The same applies to Humanity.  I think progress will make it better.  But for this you need not to invent costumes for dogs (may the critics forgive me for such a loose interpretation of Bradbury), but to improve the human condition.  Which, in turn, is intended to do automation and robotics.  While working on this thing, my friend and I just wanted to try to make the world a little bit better. Now you can kick.  But, nevertheless, we will be glad to constructive criticism. <br><br>  And now a small bonus ... I wrote a story for one of the contests, which would be better to explain this project.  Tried to publish it on Habr√©, but the UFO was not allowed.  So now I just turn it on here. <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">To read</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b81/cb2/bea/b81cb2beaf73507db56f3900bab918f3.jpg"><br><br>  For 79m year of life, dollar billionaire Yuri wanted something new.  On cruises of various kinds, he was conquered tops, descended into hollows, in a word, which he just did not do.  It would have gone all bad if it were not for his passion - technology.  He tried to be at the helm of progress, looking for promising research and encouraging them financially.  However, every year it became more and more difficult.  Even to him.  Therefore, more and more often he shifted the work to his subordinates, although he had never had such a habit before.  Starel Yuri ... <br><br>  And now, looking at the map of the world and trying to find a place where he was not yet, he became bored.  He remembered his student years, when he only wanted to go somewhere, discover something new ... Then this prospect seemed much more real.  Yuri hypnotized his eyes for so long that the sensor worked and turned off the screen.  Yuri started up, the map appeared.  Then his eyes fell on the undeveloped piece of the Earth ... Siberia.  So big, so rich and so empty.  Why Russians don't master it?  The people are not bad.  Yuri remembered Russia.  He lived there in his youth.  He remembered nature and the way the men chopped wood.  Already then, chainsaws were used with might and main, and these men were swinging axes with might and main, not yielding to the chainsaw finals in speed.  It was strange: why such people cannot master Siberia in any way?  But almost immediately he remembered everything else ... It became sad.  There are always not enough people there who could organize all, raise to the cause.  Crazy thought slipped into Yuri's brain.  ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù He answered to himself and with a firm step headed to the office. <br><br><habracut><br>  It was 18:43 Quebec and Yuri pressed the urgent meeting button.  In half an hour his entire team will be assembled.  They had to solve an interesting problem that Yuri invented for himself.  Siberia ... Yuri smiled and sat down so as not to disturb the bones once again.  All he could wish for was his availability, but he was content with his mind.  Gradually, the idea took shape and did not seem so impracticable. <br><br>  Half an hour passed quickly, and Yuri immediately asked those who had been with him for many years, those who could what he could not do, those whom he could trust almost everything except his thoughts - his team.  He asked them to show their homes.  Everyone was surprised, but they did it: Yuri never let them down.  One by one, images of internal rooms were displayed on his screens, and everywhere, everywhere his guess was confirmed!  Yuri was happy and immediately began to say: <br><br>  <i>- You are probably wondering what was my last request.</i>  <i>I wanted to check how those who work the mind live, how people who can make out of nothing live - a million.</i>  <i>How do thinkers and practitioners live, how do you live.</i>  <i>Each of you furnishes everything as it sees fit.</i>  <i>Each of you thoughtfully sat on the project of your house.</i>  <i>Each of you realized everything there that his environment should form: technologies, nature, various hobbies ... A man always creates and rework everything for himself.</i>  <i>Now look at the street, remember how they live in these megalopolises, remember the recent trip to Tokyo or last year's trip to Africa.</i>  <i>Are people happy?</i>  <i>Not.</i>  <i>In terms of housing - no.</i>  <i>The times have long passed when man needed only a roof over his head, but now he needs a room for creativity!</i>  <i>And now, my dears, open the World Map and look at Siberia.</i>  <i>How do you like her?</i> <br><br>  In response to Yuri, there was silence and, sometimes, a tap of the keys.  Although his tirades were often pronounced, it was not the emergency button that was used every day.  Yuri understood this, he waited. <br>  The first was answered by a young German who was recently accepted into this social circle. <br><br>  <i>- I see.</i>  <i>Do you propose to be off the hunt?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- If you want, you can say so.</i>  <i>On the hunt for happiness.</i>  <i>I suggest you, my friends, to do what was recently thought, if not unbelievable, then useless.</i>  <i>I propose to build a city from scratch!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>This time the silence lasted longer.</i>  <i>The German was again the first: young and practical, what could be here ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Well, let the city.</i>  <i>We have money, there will be workers.</i>  <i>Two questions - why and what?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- At first I almost answered: I want to, so that people would understand how to live.</i>  <i>Well, I also want my city name to be called.</i>  <i>I want to leave a mark on the story.</i>  <i>Most likely, this is my last big deal that I can afford.</i>  <i>Call it ambition.</i>  <i>But I propose to think over the second one all together - for this I gathered you together.</i>  <i>So the city.</i>  <i>Comfortable, fast, green.</i>  <i>Safe, of course.</i>  <i>Modern, with advanced technologies ... Well, what would people feel free.</i>  <i>Suggestions?</i> <br><br>  And again the German.  He did not sleep, or what?  However, he was an indispensable and colorful employee.  The head of the IT department, with a red Mohawk, is two meters tall.  The youngest is not yet thirty.  He distinguished himself by sending a proposal to buy one of the promising start-ups to Yury‚Äôs personal mail.  Very promising.  Yuri invited him to his company to find information, but soon he promoted to head of the IT department: Heinrich had a tremendous talent. <br><br>  <i>- Yes.</i>  <i>Stable, to stand for a long time.</i>  <i>Maybe draw an associative map?</i> <br><br>  Then everyone else started to connect.  As always, the work began to boil. <br><br>  Yuri liked brainstorming: he again felt young, able to move mountains.  It was only then that he had a good imagination, and now the opportunity to do it.  Now he didn‚Äôt even know what was better ... <br><br>  Somewhere after an hour the <a href="http://mind42.com/mindmap/4c3c17bc-ba02-4923-b016-e21a48abe6c4%3Frel%3Durl">map</a> was ready.  There was a break for an hour.  Yuri got up, walked a bit, warming up, and asked to bring dinner.  Soon he was finished and he ruled the map a little, seeing that his colleagues were doing the same.  The great thing is this internet!  Canada and Australia, and the delay is only a second!  The break was coming to an end.  Everyone gathered at the desk again to continue working.  And soon the associative map was finally ready.  It turned out to be quite large and branched, such that Yuri remembered an oak tree growing (or growing?) In his garden. <br><br>  <i>- Yes, by the way, you need more trees.</i>  <i>The city should be full of greenery, after all, ‚Äúlight‚Äù land.</i> <br><br>  A stormy stream of childhood memories washed over him.  He remembered how wonderful it was to play with the brothers in the country, how much space and beauty there was!  And in the city there was always not enough free space, greenery, everything was very compact and fussy.  He remembered that happy time, when there was enough imagination and energy, when you did not have to worry about something, because you had parents ... When you could run around the yard all day, and in the evening go to the nearest woods on a hike.  Since that time, Yuri's passion for hiking was born: there you can only rely on yourself and not your friends.  It is necessary ... <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIt would not hurt to make a large number of recreational areas, he added.</i>  <i>Or maybe ban the hell out almost all private transport?</i>  <i>After all, it brings a lot of problems, from the abundance of accidents to ordinary traffic jams.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>-Are you sure that people will want to part with it?</i>  <i>This was the word the most senior person in their team.</i>  <i>A gray-haired psychologist, PhD, who once helped Yuri in a very difficult situation.</i>  <i>Formally, he did not work for their common company, but watched the well-being of the people who worked in it.</i>  <i>His name was Dimitri.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>-I think they will not mind if we ensure the continuous and uninterrupted functioning of public transport.</i> <br><br>  But then someone from the board of directors of the logistics department was indignant. <br><br>  <i>-But how?</i>  <i>After all, for example, in the winter all roads will be swept up, and how will utilities manage to clean them?</i>  <i>Everyone knows what kind of cold in Siberia.</i>  <i>From my own experience I can say that transporting at such a time is very difficult.</i>  <i>This man, tightly knit and with powerful hands, was once engaged in transportation in one of the first enterprises of Yuri.</i>  <i>Then he sent a rational proposal on improving working conditions with substantiation and economic calculations.</i>  <i>This struck Yuri so much that he gave him the task of overseeing the task.</i>  <i>Klaus, namely his parents named him in honor of his grandfather, managed even better than he suggested: another idea appeared in his bright head.</i> <br><br>  But then an experienced specialist from the department of innovations, Nikolay, came to the rescue, it would seem that Yuri was stunned.  They were familiar with Yuri since graduate school.  Then for a while they did not see each other at all and did not communicate.  But one idea Yuri forced to contact the company in which Nikolai worked.  Then our first wise hero got his first capital, later he called him to himself, and he happily agreed.  He often helped Yuri find fundamentally new and original solutions that were always justified and brought profit.  His hallmark has always been the speed of thinking, sometimes very florid.  So now, Nikolai was able to find a sensible solution rather quickly. <br><br>  <i>- So nothing prevents us from placing transport communications and communication routes underground.</i>  <i>There they even snow that heat, even the pouring rain.</i>  <i>And everything is safe and environmentally friendly, at least as long as the practice of the metro and electric vehicles shows it that way.</i> <br><br>  Well, bezopasnik did not fail to insert his word: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúAnd less hassle with shelters.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  To which Yuri objected that they are still needed.  So, just in case. <br><br>  Klaus expressed doubt about the justification of costs, to which Yuri objected that it was not a cost to do.  Transport was discussed for quite a long time, without coming to anything fundamentally new. <br><br>  After some not very large-scale improvements, everyone came to the general opinion that it would be nice for the city to constantly be updated and improved, while at the same time wasting resources.  Systems are needed that could work independently of the person, weather conditions and other factors.  It was concluded that such a result can be achieved only by an abundance of automated systems, and preferably containing self-learning programs.  Then came the finest hour guys from the IT - department. <br><br>  And then it started ... <br><br>  Especially actively told and spoke on this issue young Japanese Sethoshi.  Raised in the family of an engineer, who spent a lot of time with his father at work, he from an early age absorbed an interest in new technologies.  How he himself joked that he began to be interested in them before he began to walk.  And the receivers collected earlier than learned to count.  He always felt sorry for the workers he saw at his father‚Äôs factory.  Feeling their titanic work, he always wanted to facilitate their work.  My father encouraged his son's interest in new technologies, because he believed that technology would radically change the world.  And on this basis, he constantly tried to invent some mechanisms and programs that facilitate work.  So the young genius of information technology and robotics grew up.  Once in the company of Yuri, he was finally able to realize all his creative potential.  Now NewEraTechnology, Inc., one of the subsidiaries of the main company of Yuri, under the leadership of Satoshi is now one of the most popular jobs. <br><br>  Satoshi and his team worked on total automation.  Their last major project was an individual autonomous and automated nuclear bunker.  He assumed complete preservation for a hundred years.  That is, a person can live in it arbitrarily and not suspect that he is under a layer of earth and concrete.  It was provided with the latest technology.  Cost expected to be better, but in principle it is possible!  Therefore, Setoshi immediately took responsibility for the development of the underground part.  Heinrich took up the infrastructure, Dimitri for talking to people ... Nikolai, Yuri and others either took over their areas of interest, or helped the others as much as they could. <br><br>  When the development phase was completed and the last plan was agreed upon, an important question arose.  Are investors interested in this project?  As a result, lengthy searches and complex negotiations were able to negotiate with several large companies that worked in the field of IT-technologies and could provide the entire city with automated communication systems, transport, factory systems, communications and many more in software and automation. <br><br>  There were no problems with the architects.  In order to avoid problems with the appearance of the city, its integrity, the entire building plan and architectural appearance was entrusted to the BuildingArtsCorporation company, which specialized in one of the new styles - bionics. <br><br>  At the time of discussion, many asked the question, why bionics?  But someone replied that this style is the most convenient and practical, allowing for non-waste construction.  Who it was - we will not know.  Probably one of the design engineers. <br><br>  The project came to an end.  Someone even started to make it.  Someone who was more comfortable working not with ideas, but with papers.  Suddenly a reasonable question followed - who would build such a huge city, if a brigade of fifty people is needed to build one multi-storey building?  Where can you hire so many workers who will agree to go to Siberia, and even work there a huge amount of time in harsh conditions?  All the participants thought for a long time while Dimitri, who had just finished his beloved Puerh with gingerbread, did not join the discussion. <br><br>  <i>- Gentlemen, everything is very simple.</i>  <i>Here we have 3 options that all should be used.</i>  <i>First, in Russia there are a lot of villages where people suffer from unemployment.</i>  <i>I think they will gladly respond to this offer.</i>  <i>Secondly, we can attract volunteers.</i>  <i>There are still people in the world who are capable of labor and moral feats.</i>  <i>As a result, we will recruit a sufficient number of people to build the city.</i>  <i>And in the third - guess yourself.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúBut the construction is too huge ...‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- We will build sectors, then we can use fewer people at once, rather than building the whole city at the same time.</i> <br><br>  Interrupting his colleague, Dmitry poured himself more tea and continued his modest meal.  Yuri once again was amazed with how easily his friends are working on the problems.  Perhaps the main talent of Yuri is the ability to find the right people.  He was always lucky with people.  And now he felt that further he was not really needed: the experts understood the problem, the specialists are working.  Behind this, he decided to retire, saying that he would connect later.  He did not need to motivate anyone: the task itself was motivated approximately like a flight into space ... <br><br>  And the work of a general plan, where Yuri could help, remained quite a bit.  Now one of the hardest things is behind him - to organize agreement at all levels, form a lobby and just find investors.  Plus, Yuri was thinking about registering another company.  Something like ‚ÄúSmartCity, inc‚Äù.  He liked to distribute each line of business by company: it is necessary to organize less, fewer top managers, separate accounting ... There were significant drawbacks, but for Yuri the scheme of separate companies was more convenient.  On it, their registered more than a hundred in different countries.  Yuri disconnected from the conference and connected to his work base.  Looking through the entire list of people and their contacts, using filters on social status, hobbies and a couple more parameters, he searched for the right people.  Who was there only in the end was not!  Taking into account the fact that today was the day in Russia, Yuri began to write letters.  To each his own, as required by etiquette.  Turning on the good old music and sipping the good old brandy, Yuri recalled and wrote, put into each letter a spark, a certain reflection of the idea that had already grown into a project and is now developing into a technical task for specialists.  It was his second talent - to be able to infect people with his idea, simply speaking of her sincerely.  However, Yuri blamed it on their genius and accessibility. <br><br>  Suddenly, the brandy ended.  Since the list of people also came to an end, Yuri decided not to be distracted anymore.  Soon the last letter was gone.  Now you can connect to the conference. <br><br>  There were heated debates about the integration of infrastructure, the degree of automation and the culture of citizens.  Since the truth is born in disputes, Yuri is also involved in the discussion. <br><br>  It was a long time after midnight in Quebec, when all the survivors (some, after all, Yuri lifted out of bed!) Realized that they had earned money.  Now almost everything was ready.  Formation of TZ left for later, but for now all the work was leaked to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/modernopolis/">web</a> , laid out in open access.  Suddenly, the community will pick up, as it picked up many other interesting projects?  At the last dose of air and sleep, they did a small <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform%3Fformkey%3DdHBIempJRmRNeE5ZUXl0b3F3R1BzbXc6MQ">survey</a> , threw it into the net. <br><br>  In the morning (hereinafter, speaking about the time, we will mean the time of Quebec) the first reviews were received. <br>  As expected, the absolute majority of the current situation is not satisfied.  At the same time, most of all people are not satisfied with their surroundings and infrastructure: they would like to see people more cultured and more educated, and infrastructure - more thoughtful, more modern and more reliable.  Moreover, most of them saw problems precisely in the absence of a sufficient level of culture.  And it is not surprising, because culture is the basis for the development of any person, therefore, the key to further human development.

Nadezhdy Setoshi collapsed like a house of cards: it was necessary to look for an alternative.  He immediately set about working on this issue, convening a conference ... After half an hour of discussion, just when Yuri joined, everyone came to the conclusion that full automation is impossible, because it is imposed.  Yuriy immediately recalled one of the fantastic works, where a reasonable machine took the leadership over Humanity, limiting the freedom of people in their own interests.  Dimitri, who came up, called it the ‚ÄúDeus Ex Machina‚Äù syndrome.  Like, since the time of Frankenstein lives, one way or another, in everyone.  It was necessary to find a compromise between this syndrome and comfort, which attracts automation.  Started a heated discussion.  So stormy that reminded the New York Stock Exchange. <br><br>  Over the course of this dispute, several solutions have been found.  The first and the simplest was that machines and programs should be under human control, at least in the control centers of the entire infrastructure.  Like, if something terrible suddenly happened, a person could turn off an ‚Äúout of place‚Äù automated device.  It would seem that the problem was solved by itself, but then Dimitri remembered the human factor. <br><br>  <i>- Here you want to give the main control to people.</i>  <i>Do not you think that in view of various circumstances a person can make a fatal mistake?</i>  <i>Remember at least Chernobyl, one of the largest man-made disasters, admitted through the fault of man?</i>  <i>The operator could rectify the situation, but, like any other person in an emergency, could not calculate the situation at least two moves ahead!</i>  <i>No, people are too imperfect to allow them to manage other people's lives.</i> <br><br>  Yuri again reminded about the syndrome ‚ÄúDeus Ex‚Äù: <br>  <i>‚ÄúYou yourself know that people cannot completely trust in machines, since they themselves created them!‚Äù</i>  <i>They know that cars may be imperfect, but they are unforgivable.</i>  <i>People can make mistakes - this is a fact that everyone understands!</i> <br><br>  Cried Sethoshi: <br>  <i>‚ÄúHow dare we decide who will lead the people?‚Äù</i>  <i>Machines are reasonable, but this mind is not enough.</i>  <i>This is me as a developer talking.</i>  <i>Even the most perfect neural network will not be able to act in emergency situations!</i>  <i>A man can!</i>  <i>But a person can completely stifle the mind and be banal scared!</i>  <i>And the price is thousands of lives!</i> <br><br>  Dimitri spoke in a cold, imperious tone, not tolerating objections: <br><br>  <i>- You're right.</i>  <i>And yet, in vain, in your opinion, did I mention a miscalculation for two moves?</i>  <i>It's simple.</i>  <i>When a person is under the control of emotions, he puts pressure on only one red button.</i>  <i>When the mind takes possession of it, it becomes capable of plugging the plug into an outlet.</i>  <i>So it is here.</i>  <i>While a person is under the control of emotions alone and presses on the alarm button, the machine controls the whole.</i>  <i>When emotions get a little muffled and the operator becomes able to turn the toggle switch, he takes control.</i>  <i>Thus, we will maximally secure ourselves from mistakes.</i>  <i>Of course, if the machine is calculated at the same time by another machine and only if they coincide, the team will be executed.</i>  <i>The probability of software and hardware errors is excluded, the probability of a person acting in the heat of passion is excluded ... Is everything clear?</i> <br><br>  Half a minute was quiet.  Then Yury got up and slowly began to clap.  Ten seconds later, the speakers of all those who were connected to the stereo conference were heard with applause.  Yuri realized that there was quite a bit. <br><br>  <i>- Gentlemen, since we have solved almost all the questions and are ready to start implementation, let me have a couple more questions.</i>  <i>R &amp; D department, what unspoken do you have?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Nothing.</i>  <i>There are a couple of promising developments that can be useful, but we need to bring them at least to the state of working prototypes.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Ok, keep me informed.</i>  <i>Moreover, try to expand connections with R &amp; D of other companies, try to buy promising works.</i>  <i>You can talk from my time and spend 30% of the total capital.</i>  <i>Financial, what have you got?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Yesterday we calculated a very rough estimate.</i>  <i>If you do not cut funding and do not change the financial flows, using all the reserves, then we will have enough to build the entire infrastructure and almost two residential areas.</i>  <i>After that, it will be necessary to accept the fact that we have a full zero free capital and any drawdown will lead to the sale of assets.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Everything is not so bad.</i>  <i>I thought we didn‚Äôt even have enough infrastructure.</i>  <i>Marketing department and PR department, what do you say?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúIf we launch a huge aggressive marketing policy, like the one we did, capturing the market for lenses with displays, then in four months it will be possible to attract about 17% of our authorized capital and practically all the necessary population.</i>  <i>It will be more difficult with personnel; all information was transferred to the personnel department.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Human Resources Department?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- When connecting universities and technical schools, we can cover this need by about 60%.</i>  <i>With the consolidation and transfer of their employees - another 12%.</i>  <i>Luring employees from competitors - 14 percent. So there is a chance.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúOkay, so be it.‚Äù</i>  <i>IT and Automation - what do you have?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- I'm afraid it's not so good.</i>  <i>We ourselves will not cope with the development and implementation of infrastructure.</i>  <i>Or the community is connected, or someone else.</i>  <i>Otherwise, the work will take ten years minimum.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Well ... That is bad.</i>  <i>It remains to hope for the community: there were no people willing to share the risks.</i>  <i>Only one of my friends agreed, at the same time complaining that all his money was spent on space exploration.</i>  <i>Have you tried to contact the community?</i>  <i>Cry there on a social network run?</i>  <i>I think there will be volunteers like there were at the very beginning of SPO.</i>  <i>The transfer of all work materials to the public domain will only contribute to this.</i>  <i>Of course, except for those that are our unique developments.</i>  <i>Polycarbonate lenses, for example or something else.</i>  <i>Lawyers, what do you say?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Russia.</i>  <i>What else can you say?</i>  <i>To build the same city in Canada or else where it would be much easier.</i>  <i>There is a chance to reach the upper level of the government and form a lobby there, then everything will work out.</i>  <i>But this is either with a change in the composition of the government, or in the presence of various resources.</i>  <i>In addition, there is a chance to go to the MIC.</i>  <i>If they are interested in this project, only the FSB can give a red light.</i>  <i>And this is unlikely.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Well, then connect the information department and the PR department and try to agree on implementation, since it‚Äôs deaf to me.</i>  <i>Now the security department.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Well, if we do not talk about the strangeness of the undertaking and the high risks in the case of Russia, then everything is fine.</i>  <i>We have been working with the community and volunteers for seven years, as it was set.</i>  <i>Audit in other departments is carried out regularly.</i>  <i>The possibility of intercepting such an easily realized and so risky idea is very small.</i>  <i>Recommendations on the work of the departments we already sent them by mail.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- By the way, yes, send each other various recommendations, suggestions, valuable tips and more ... Interact with each other!</i>  <i>I had enough of your past failure, when we lost a whole market, even if subsequently unprofitable!</i>  <i>You can not work on a complex project separately.</i>  <i>Who did we make the technical specification?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- System analysts.</i>  <i>Soon should be.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Well, I'll wait for them, and you, how to sleep and be ready to work - start.</i>  <i>I believe in you friends.</i>  <i>Dimitri, if you can, stay.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>All turned off.</i>  <i>There were no system analysts yet and they could calmly talk.</i>  <i>Yuri often these conversations were more necessary than air: Dimitri always understood him.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Dima, do you think this is actually real?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Actually, Jura.</i>  <i>Look at your guys.</i>  <i>Especially on the young.</i>  <i>Did you notice the change in the face of Heinrich, Klaus, Sethos?</i>  <i>They began to shine.</i>  <i>You gave them the task, over which they will fight, as if it were the last.</i>  <i>You gave them a goal.</i>  <i>Maybe even a lifetime.</i>  <i>We haven‚Äôt done anything for a long time, having come down to profit and market dominance.</i>  <i>This project will allow us to heal a new life, breathe deeply.</i>  <i>He will attract such people that the rest will envy us.</i>  <i>And this is your merit, Yura.</i>  <i>Yours</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Yes, maybe you are right ... But still ... If it‚Äôs so simple, if we can‚Äôt do it, then why hasn‚Äôt it been done yet?</i>  <i>Any government can do the same, many companies can do the same.</i>  <i>Why no one thought of it?</i>  <i>Are you sure this is the right way?</i>  <i>What it simply did not find?</i>  <i>After all, I would otherwise die with my company, but, as you know, I did not have long.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- I know.</i>  <i>But I cannot answer your question.</i>  <i>Just hint.</i>  <i>Do you think Nicholas would have decided to put his work in the public domain?</i>  <i>Why do you think you decided to start a city right now?</i>  <i>What do you think, who and how manages in all other companies, governments and so on?</i>  <i>Who do you think will be able to stand with you in community support?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- That is ... It's about people, right?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Yes, Yura.</i>  <i>It's always about people.</i>  <i>You decided to do what others consider impossible.</i>  <i>You made up your mind and infected others with your determination.</i>  <i>You could.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúI could ... Yes.‚Äù</i>  <i>I could.</i>  <i>I always delirious ideas about good and justice, about the highest role of humanity ... Perhaps it was this that gave me strength.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Maybe.</i>  <i>Well done, Yuri.</i>  <i>Whatever happened, you were right.</i> <br><br>  Dimitri disconnected.  Yuri sat and sipped his wine.  He was flooded with memories of the country in which he was born.  Large, huge, spacious.  But which already as twenty-odd years did not exist.  He recalled that from the general world it was emphasized that there was an ideology not of enrichment, but an ideology of world perfection.  Where they believed not in a dollar, but in a bright future.  Where people went to work, not because they wanted money, but because they had a desire to learn a particular profession.  Wanting to deepen their knowledge, they attended various circles from childhood, in which they often grew into a great love for business and a sense of relevance.  He almost did not let a tear.  when I remembered the day when humankind first flew into space.  And his compatriot Yuri Gagarin flew there first.  And he remembered how everyone exulted, and everyone thought, ‚ÄúHere it is!  Here it is, which will give a new round to humanity.  We will explore new planets.  worlds. "  And he was proud that his name was also Yuri ... And what now?  The lunar program was turned, Mars is not in a hurry to fly, but space tourism began its development.  But he was not worried about the very presence of tourism, as the lack of active study of the immense and unexplored, which keeps many secrets and mysteries.  Is the desire to get rich in a man overcame the desire to learn!  Yuri realized that he could have done even more useful things in his life, but he did not have time.  And therefore, the desire to create a city in which all residents would comfortably flared in it with a new force.  And this fire was no longer possible to put out, because the awareness of their mistakes, their inaction, squeezed it from head to toe.  And he was determined to do for the young people what he could strive for the benefit of all mankind.  So, tormented by reflections, he sat up to the early morning and with difficulty, overcoming insomnia, he fell asleep, because he could not stay awake all day and night as he did it 50-70 years ago. <br><br>  System analysts sent to the general mail TK.  Yuri looked, not understanding.  This will be done by experts.  Experts must do everything ... Yuri gathered people, provided them with conditions ... For him, the words of Dimitri and shine in the eyes of the staff were now the highest award.  Unnoticed, he fell asleep. <br><br>  It was already the second month of project development.  He was brought to its final stage.  Everyone has already gathered online conferences to celebrate this.  Everyone was waiting for Dimitri.  Five minutes passed, ten, half an hour.  Suddenly an alarming speaker sounded: Dimitri died.  Stopped the heart.  He was found in his office, in front of him lay an archaic fountain pen and paper.  The last one read: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúTo humanity.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I lived a lot and saw a lot.</i>  <i>It's time for me to leave.</i>  <i>But before that, I implore you, keep the fire in your chest!</i>  <i>Let your eyes light up and let the hearts of the younger generation sing!</i>  <i>I lived to a great day - to the day when the Fire returned.</i>  <i>I'm leaving happy.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>PS Yuri, remember, you're right. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Tears washed over Yuri.  How?  For what?  No one could answer Yuri.  He was right ... Now the whole life of Yuri has been reduced to the construction of the city.  He had to do it for the sake of Dimitri.  In his honor.  In his memory.  Yuri has departed from everything, except from work.  Nikolay, seeing his condition, tried not to interfere.  Yuri would be grateful if I could pay attention to this.  But all his attention was absorbed by the work: how not to forget, where to improve something, why it is not ready yet ... <br>  So three years have passed.  The ‚Äúunderground city‚Äù was being built, the administration building was commissioned.  Yuri had paralysis of the lower extremities, he moved only on a robotic gurney.  He began to see worse, fine motor skills disappeared as a skill. <br><br>  And so, on a snowy and cold day, almost in the very center of Siberia, the opening ceremony of the city took place.  The whole company of Yuri, from the authorities to the ordinary employees who wanted to come, tops of governments and companies, the UN Secretary General, simple hard workers and volunteers ... Everyone who was not indifferent to the fate of the City.  Under the square on which the action took place, the huge entrails of an as yet unprepared creature called the City, ready for work and supplies.  In the administration building - the central computer, which was to be included in the operation mode.  On the paved square there is a monument covered with scarlet velvet.  On the very same square there were people who came not for the sake of shows, but for the sake of an idea.  A speaker approached the monument.  It was Heinrich who replaced Yuri when he could not work because of his illness. <br><br>  <i>- It's a great day!</i>  <i>Today a new era begins, when a person creates for himself not a dwelling, but a house.</i>  <i>Through the efforts of enthusiasts this era was started.</i>  <i>Through the efforts of those who care about the future.</i>  <i>Two were at the helm.</i>  <i>Yuri and Dimitri, you know them.</i> <br><br>  From the monument fell velvet.  A sculpture was opened from a seemingly bursting out of the granite of the globe, from which the rocket was launched.  On the sides there were two men ‚Äî a tall, gray-haired old man with a staff, with Dimitri‚Äôs features, and a young guy with Yury‚Äôs face.  They smiled, holding hands.  Applause rang out into a standing ovation. <br>  Heinrich continued: <br><br>  <i>- I do not like to talk a lot and for a long time, and there‚Äôs nothing to say.</i>  <i>Yes, change the era!</i> <br><br>  He pressed the remote.  The administration name on the board was highlighted.  Electronic blood flowed through communications underground, once again checking the integrity.  Fireworks erupted.  Yuri smiled.  And he died.  He died happy.  At the moment of the change of epochs, the parent of this epoch left, leaving his legacy to the next generation.  There were tears in Henry's eyes.  He knew.  He was afraid.  He was hoping.  But still it happened.  Now he is alone.  One manages the company.  One is building the city.  One realizes oneself in life ... <br><br>  He grew up an orphan, not knowing love.  His biography is sulfur.  He was convicted of cybercrime.  But at the last moment he was released and invited to work.  Heinrich did not understand why this was necessary.  Then the promotion, the work on the project ... Only two years ago, on the anniversary of the death of Dimitri, Yuri summoned him.  They talked a lot and for a long time.  Parted like a father and son.  Yuri adopted him by transferring all his business.  It was not the age of majority, not the inheritance of property, but the inheritance of the idea ... This is how Yuri explained, looking at the portrait of Nicholas.  Only then did Heinrich find out about the last letter of Nicholas.  Only then did he realize that these two friends actually did.  And so, his father died.  Heinrich was able to make his death happy.  Now he needed to perpetuate his memory by launching this man-made creation under the name City into life ... There was a lot of work that was hard, complicated and interesting.  As always. <br><br></habracut></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165467/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165467/</a></p>
