But if a conference ends for a participant by filling out a feedback form, then for organizers everything is different: you have to wait for all the responses, analyze them and draw conclusions for the future.  So instead of a race for fast publishing, we first figured out how it should be that the audience really liked it. <br><br>  But the conference begins for the organizers very much in advance, and during the May St. Petersburg Mobius we were already thinking about the <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D458050">December Moscow city</a> .  Therefore, in this post we not only remember the past, but also look into the future.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Reports </h2><br>  The entire program of the two-day conference can not be re-told.  But we will name five performances that the audience liked very much: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Andrei Breslav has</b> previously spoken at Mobius with great success, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DerYcipxBty0">telling</a> then how other languages ‚Äã‚Äãhad an effect on Kotlin.  But this time he was talking about a completely different thing: the conference was opening a keyout on how developers approach their own and other people's emotions in order to work best.  And with his own emotions, he also worked here, starting from the appearance: ‚ÄúUsually I am very worried about how I look, so I specifically decided to wear silly ears and notice that nothing has changed.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kg/xg/em/kgxgemkloteg8thm6hjnnrkmxtc.jpeg"><br><br>  For many, the name ‚ÄúBreslav‚Äù became almost a synonym for ‚ÄúKotlin‚Äù, and then suddenly a performance without this name at all, so it was not obvious: how will it be accepted?  Reviews have shown that in this role, Andrew really liked the developers. <br><br>  On the first day of Mobius, we had a free broadcast of the first hall.  Therefore, you can <a href="https://youtu.be/CBzabCoJgAY%3Ft%3D3626">watch</a> the performance of Andrey yourself, it is available to the whole world. </li><li>  Of course, accessibility is an important topic, but usually not provoking enthusiastic enthusiasm.  And, it would seem, everything has already been said about it.  Therefore, from the report of <b>John Fox</b> (Netflix) about the ‚ÄúAccessibility for iOS‚Äù one could expect that the reviews would also be without enthusiasm: they say, well, yes, you should think about it all, thanks for the information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mj/l6/k6/mjl6k6c8zhd56g_h26sblbb1wme.jpeg"><br><br>  But it turned out that when the speaker is quite charming and fascinated by his topic, it changes things: the audience was not very much on the report, but he received excellent grades.  And later, John vividly spoke at the BoF-session, remembering many there. </li><li>  It turned out to be interesting with <b>Stepan Goncharov</b> .  Initially, he dealt with one topic of the report, and when there was relatively little time left before the conference, it changed to ‚ÄúOptimization of the Gradle Pipeline‚Äù.  But in the end, the report did not leave a feeling of something stuck together hastily, but got into the top 5.  And he also got into the open broadcast - so that you can already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCBzabCoJgAY%26t%3D15487s">watch it</a> yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yb/lo/ig/ybloigvau7qvxmeztmsyfv9jflk.jpeg"><br></li><li>  The famous android guide <b>Jonathan Levin</b> (Monday.com) is more predictable.  Last time he got under the hood, figuring out why we need D8 and R8 - and got into the top reports.  This one also turned to ‚Äúhow it really works there,‚Äù but now he considered the memory and again received excellent marks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gc/j0/h_/gcj0h_k4ecdy_-oljoft9ohryt8.jpeg"><br><br>  Not that some surprising discoveries were made in the report - theoretically, everything can be learned without Jonathan.  But if you didn‚Äôt understand this topic before, it‚Äôs great to get information in an hour in an affordable way from a charismatic speaker.  And for everyone who was not on the report, here‚Äôs a little tip from it: <a href="https://github.com/square/leakcanary">LeakCanary</a> helps to find memory <a href="https://github.com/square/leakcanary">leaks</a> . </li><li>  You may remember the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-worst-volume-control-ui-in-the-world-60713dc86950">competition</a> for the ‚Äúworst UX volume knobs‚Äù - there were many very funny options.  But <b>Vitaly Friedman</b> (Smashing Magazine) is familiar with interfaces that look just as crazy, but they are made quite seriously.  Specify the number of children using the slider?  Which is the maximum value?  Who and how did it come to mind?  And how do we do everything right instead? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/yh/-a/aayh-ardud0lavhpsdewpviqego.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, in this report on interfaces, examples are so colorful that you involuntarily think about "why all this did not become supervirus and I did not see it."  And Vitali himself is so charming that no one can resist: he spoke at our other events and in front of the front-tenders, and in front of the testers, and the estimates were always high. </li><li>  And who became the leader of the conference in audience ratings?  Here, it depends on how you count: look only at the assessments of the report, or also take into account the number of gathered spectators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-e/pb/vs/-epbvsbwamwudimxjbkmjnbdapu.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Evgeny Rtishchev</sup> <br><br>  In the first case, the conference's favorite is <b>Evgeny Rtishchev</b> (Sberbank) with the iOS report ‚ÄúWe work with the network efficiently‚Äù.  And in the second, adjusted for the size of the audience, <b>Denis Neklyudov</b> (Lyft), who, on the basis of Lyft‚Äôs experience, told us how to create an ‚Äúoutgrowth‚Äù architecture. <br><br>  And in the case of Denis, there is an interesting continuity: half a year earlier at the previous Mobius, the leader was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DWd91Y8sRs2k">report of</a> <b>Artyom Zinnatullin</b> , who also based on Lyft‚Äôs experience to draw useful conclusions for all - but there it was not about the architecture, but about the means of assembly. </li></ul><br><h2>  In addition to reports </h2><br>  What else could be seen at the conference? <br><br>  As usual, each report was followed by communication with the speaker in the discussion area, where you could ask him about everything.  That is, if someone had a question to Andrei Breslav about Kotlin, then there was an opportunity to ask him, despite the other topic of the report.  By the way, it is not surprising that a bunch of people gathered around Andrew in the discussion area: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gg/jd/a7/ggjda7trgufo3q4girm7qe9ymny.jpeg"><br><br>  Another traditional component was the BoF-session - discussion of pressing issues, in which all interested persons participated.  This time they were at the English-speaking session (where the English-speaking speakers were) discussed what would happen with mobile development in 5 years, and in Russian they talked about the wages of mobile developers. <br><br>  The English-speaking BoF-session was interesting (for example, the already-mentioned John Fox vividly participated and joked), but the main heat was in Russian.  There, the discussion of money issues with the participation of Jonathan Levin and Denis Neklyudov went something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tk/x1/p_/tkx1p_4tuip2osmzvywgjflquuu.jpeg"><br><br>  Here for those who were not present, we will also extract one thesis: do not forget that there are not only salaries, but also options. <br><br>  Of course, a lot of things happened on the stands.  For example, the company CFT arranged a competition ‚ÄúKlava, come on‚Äù: the two participants had to jointly complete the task, and only a part of the buttons were available to everyone on the keyboard.  Pair programming has never been so complementary! <br><br>  And the CFT stickers came to life, if you look at them through a special application: where else can you demonstrate mobile AR, if not at a mobile development conference? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wr/o1/bl/wro1blstncrkxdicwc7ruclo-wg.jpeg"><br><br>  There were a number of other large companies (Sberbank, VKontakte, Alfa-Bank, Odnoklassniki and not only), and the VK booth would be particularly worth noting. <br><br>  First, it was effectively decorated.  And secondly, the ‚Äúbattle between iOS and Android‚Äù arranged there (the interface design contest was broken up) attracted a lot of attention.  It is curious that SwiftUI was introduced shortly after the conference - I wonder how much it will affect such contests in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-t/95/az/-t95azg5xe7abzk1xa643wdazeu.jpeg"><br><br>  Another thing about Mobius was that it was more convenient to look at without being physically at a conference.  So that in the online broadcast between the reports there was no half an hour of silence, we interviewed some of the speakers.  Those that on the second day, went only to the paid broadcast.  But the interview for the first day is available in the same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCBzabCoJgAY">recording of the</a> broadcast on YouTube (in the first comment from the viewer there are time codes, thanks to him). <br><br>  And besides our broadcast, on the site also recorded their releases podcasters - from <a href="https://androiddev.apptractor.ru/android-dev-podcast-95/">Android Dev Podcast</a> to the same <a href="https://team.cft.ru/news/71">CFT</a> . <br><br><h2>  Next mobius </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a-/ol/hs/a-olhslcr0qw8yhn4qa6jukfwcm.jpeg"><br><br>  At this, the results can be considered as summed up.  What's next? <br><br>  First of all, <b>Mobius 2019 Moscow</b> has specific dates: <b>December 7-8</b> . <br><br>  Secondly, there is generally expected the same as described above.  Technical reports and live BoF-sessions, activity on the stands and interviews in online broadcasts - the format of the conference will be the same. <br><br>  Thirdly, if you watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCBzabCoJgAY">open broadcast of the</a> past Mobius, you might notice some bias: either Android reports or multi-platform ones (without iOS-specific ones) got there.  Indeed, on the past Mobius reports and famous speakers from the Android world turned out a little more.  But this does not mean that we do not care about iOS - it just so happens that everything is more complicated with iOS speakers.  So we will try to ensure that in the future at the conference it would be interesting to all mobile developers, regardless of the platform. <br><br>  Fourth, we are ready to announce the first names of the speakers of the Mobius 2019 Moscow.  One of them is <b>Vitaly Friedman</b> : since everyone liked the St. Petersburg performance so much, then Moscow would not be without him.  And besides him, the co-founders of the Halide project: <b>Ben Sandofsky</b> and <b>Sebastiaan de Wies</b> will be with a joint report (tens of thousands of people read on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/sdw">@sdw</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/sandofsky">@sandofsky</a> ).  Halide is a photo application for iOS, so, as you can see, we have already taken on the Apple side. <br><br>  Fifthly, if it is interesting for you not only to listen, but also to speak, now is the time to submit your <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/cfp/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D458050">application for a report</a> .  For example, we would be interested in a detailed analysis of something presented on Google I / O or WWDC (except for Jetpack Compose, this niche is already occupied).  But in general, everything that can be useful for mobile developers is interesting. <br><br>  And sixthly, tickets are already <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/registration/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D458050">on sale</a> , and they traditionally go up in price over time.  So, although you can wait for a more complete program, it is more profitable to purchase them now. <br><br>  See you in Moscow! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j6/iw/oo/j6iwoogx3fwdydx5_vqi-zcu0eo.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458050/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458050/</a></p>
