  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Universal informatization - good?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With a sinking heart, I watched the computer age enter my native Belarus.  Suppose that with slippage, with a creak, with a delay of years to ... eleven, but still it happens little by little.  And I, as a progressive person, cannot but rejoice.  And yet let's look at the positive and negative aspects of progress. <br><br>  From the positive sides - progress is coming.  This is noticeable to the naked eye.  Today, I can pay for the Internet from the Internet, for an apartment, gas, electricity ‚Äî I can do about 60% of what a Belgian could do ten years ago. This is great! <br><br>  For legal entities - in general, everything is rosy!  You do not need to run every day to the bank with bills, to transport declarations to the tax, and discount cards to Social Security.  Let us now turn to the wrong side of progress, so to speak, plunge into the abyss of technology. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For some reason, it often raises questions half-hearted decisions.  For example.  You sign with a digital signature ‚Äúa stack of documents‚Äù - and ... That's right.  You carry a signed pack on a diskette to a control authority.  Why not do otherwise?  Perhaps this is due to inertia of the body itself or its regional division.  But even for not wearing a diskette, but a flash drive - I had to pretty much make war.

      Still, the biggest scourge is the terrifying curvature of many software products.  Let my words do not offend anyone, but many of the developments are more like a sophomore student‚Äôs course project, moreover, made into ‚Äúthree‚Äù.  Perhaps this is due to the long process of all sorts of approvals and assertions, and at the output we get a morally obsolete product.  I was pleased with the recent call to one of the ‚Äúorgans‚Äù of the following content: <br><br>  - Hello, good afternoon, your software has been updated, it does not want to work ... In the date field you can‚Äôt enter the correct value ... <br>  - Ah, well, this is a glitch.  Reinstall or open-close a couple of times. <br><br>  Just like that, easily and naturally.  What are the fixes?  What patches?  What for?  Opened-closed ... Speaking of technical support.  It simply is not.  Of course, after an hour of calls to different phones, you may be able to achieve something, but there is no system as a whole. <br><br>  I do not believe that programmers can not write a program that can be used simply, and not to fight it.  There are very strong programmers in Belarus and they proved it many times.  It is only necessary to correct the system in some places.  IMHO is very wrong when a sysadmin writes a program, and then it is ‚Äúlaunched from the top‚Äù to all branches and given to users.  Of course, it's cheaper.  But you can give this work to third-party developers.  Everything will be better.  And then solve the issue with technical support - and we will be happy. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98685/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98685/</a></p>
