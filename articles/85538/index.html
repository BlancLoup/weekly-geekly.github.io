      It is logical to assume that the venue is timed to the recent day of the defender, so that everything converges.  The gloomy setting was ‚Äúsaved‚Äù by a multitude of lanterns with artificial fire - thanks to them, one could consider all sorts of attributes of the room.  Headphones, stands with knives and rifles, some statues and busts.  Unusual! <br><br><img src="http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/5083/81635968.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/5665/91187833.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As always, representatives of the most IT-editions gathered. <br><br><img src="http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/6208/28373665.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The event was entirely devoted to the development of Intel in the field of network communications.  Unfortunately, almost all of the information was confidential (not for disclosure and partly not even for photos), so the specifics will be a minimum - thank you for your understanding. <br><br>  <i>Let me see, - Woland extended his hand, palm up.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúI, unfortunately, cannot do this,‚Äù answered the master, ‚Äúbecause I burned it in the oven.‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúSorry, I won't believe it,‚Äù answered Woland, ‚Äúthis cannot be.‚Äù</i>  <i>Manuscripts do not burn.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- He turned to Behemoth and said: - Come on, Hippo, give me a novel.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The cat instantly jumped out of his chair, and everyone saw that he was sitting on a thick bundle of manuscripts.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The upper copy of a cat with a bow gave Woland.</i> <br>  M.A.Bulgakov, "Master and Margarita";) <br><h2>  IT </h2><br>  It has already become a tradition that <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/75446/">Alexey Rogachkov</a></b> , an Intel specialist, begins the story.  With a pinch of healthy humor, with colorful slides, the first thing he told about the global pace of WiMAX development.  Amazingly, in 2009 the network coverage increased from 20 to 105 million people, with the main components of this figure being the USA (35 million), Russia (25 million) and Japan.  It is expected that by the end of 2010, these figures will double, and several other large countries will come into play along the way. <br><br><img src="http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/5416/90721637.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, it is no secret that the same standards in different countries work in different conditions.  Here, for example, looks like a map of the world, colored in the colors of the working frequency bands: <br><br><img src="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/3295/19645921.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, Waimax is definitely being.  A little later, <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/70818/">Dmitry Laryushin</a></b> , the main one in Intel on wireless technologies, confirmed this.  He told a few words about the new Kilmer Peak WiMAX chip, about its hazy past and bright near future.  So far this is the only chip (which is embedded in various mobile devices such as laptops), capable of operating in three bands: 2.3, 2.5 and 3.5 GHz.  Well, in conclusion, a very secret chip for the Moorestown platform, codenamed <b>Evans Peak,</b> was shed light.  In a coin the size of a coin there will be a whole set of scout - Wi-Fi (a / b / g / n), WiMAX, BT and GPS! <br><br><img src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/9876/18490080.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then Alexey reappeared on the improvised stage - the story was about the wonderful <b>Intel My WiFi</b> technology. <br><br><img src="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/6402/97285363.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Speaking very roughly, this technology is designed to facilitate the connection of devices to a WiFi network.  Right in the hall, Aleksey Rogachkov took a camera with the wireless communication function, took a picture and after pressing only a couple of buttons, the picture from the laptop was already shown through the projector. <br><br><img src="http://img169.imageshack.us/img169/6568/85203718.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/4319/72642225.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Accordingly, the function is primarily intended to simplify the creation of a network, all kinds of synchronization, printers and content transfer.  All this is created at the program level and, in principle, is already available for testing.  And yes, there are rumors that there will be a separate hardware button for laptops for this function. <br><br>  And, of course, it was not without the acclaimed <b>Intel Wireless Display</b> technology, which was presented to the world on January 7, 2010 at CES2010.  There were no demonstrations of the function itself, but the roadmap for 2010 was shown :) At the moment there are several laptops (from Dell, Sony and Toshiba) that can boast of displaying pictures on the TV without any wires - they have a module with the firmware version installed 1.0.  So far this technology is capable of transmitting HD content with a resolution of 1280x720p, although it was clear from the specifications that the technology was initially sharpened for several other tasks. <br><br><img src="http://img682.imageshack.us/img682/8607/34284839.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In version 1.1 of the software, the resolution is already 1366x768, and then more (and it will be possible to update yourself quite independently).  But this speech is absolutely about the future - first you need to wait for the dawn of Wi-Fi N in Russia.  Well, if you really can not wait, you can try your luck in finding a kit from the company NETGEAR - they are still the first and only ones who make equipment for a new technology. <br><br><img src="http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/9333/20417017.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And then it was the most interesting ...) <br><img src="http://img15.imageshack.us/img15/5774/93834167.jpg" alt="image"><br><h2>  LJ </h2><br>  As I said, the meeting was held in the Predator shooting complex.  So it would be strange if they did not allow to shoot) The arsenal was the following - 4 carbines (Vepr-308, Los-7, Saiga MK-03 and OP SKS) and 3 pistols (IL-71, SKSK and Viking). <br><br><img src="http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/2657/92975150.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the close attention of instructors (no less harsh than Chuck Norris), each invited person was given a certain ("test") number of cartridges and a final sheet, where the results were recorded. <br><br><img src="http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/7747/19419821.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Headphones that evening were in great demand - the peak of ‚Äúsales‚Äù came after the first shot of a carbine :) It‚Äôs a pity that there was practically no lighting everywhere, and there was no way to photograph with a flash - so much so that grew. <br><br>  I have absolutely nothing to brag about.  The carbines were fired from a distance of 40 meters - at such a distance from the target I only saw the silhouette of the target.  Accordingly, the "good" shot only through optics - 38 points out of 40 on the Boar-308. <br><br><img src="http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/4223/87698412.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img641.imageshack.us/img641/6933/79958428.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With a pistol shooting a little better, because  the distance was, like, 25 meters.  18 of 20 at PKSK and 34 of 40 at Viking.  Last machine especially liked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/513/2cb/29b/5132cb29bcfc9b0681258af168759020.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4390/96725775.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Without offset, it was possible to shoot at moving targets - there were any scenes to choose from, since  image was displayed by projectors.  Counter Strike is resting. <br><br><img src="http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/5557/93166747.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/3855/37699708.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/6272/73321112.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It was somewhat amusing to watch this picture - when a bunch of geeks turned literally into children, lining up to play "war games") The girls were let out of the queue - surprisingly, they shot at some points no worse than some guys. <br><br><img src="http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/9339/52970359.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  An unusual sight! <br><br>  When the powder in the old dog fires ended, the most-most handed gifts, and all the rest were invited to get acquainted with the novelties of netbooks - from ASUS, Acer and Toshiba.  Naturally, the new Atom new network modules, new surfaces (hooray, finally matte!).  The other day I will try to review one of the new products. <br><br><img src="http://img718.imageshack.us/img718/7260/99366984.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I should pay tribute to Intel for another unforgettable meeting - I do not know how, but they know how to hold memorable events.  It is good when everything is treated responsibly and with a soul. <br><br><img src="http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/9600/46174005.jpg" alt="image"><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://www.intel.com/sites/sitewide/pix/favicon.ico" alt="image">  <a href="http://ru.intel.com/galaxy/forum/index.php">Intel Galaxy</a> :: <img src="http://www.intel.com/sites/sitewide/pix/favicon.ico" alt="image">  <a href="http://ru.intel.com/business/community/index.php">IT Galaxy</a> :: <img src="http://www.intel.com/sites/sitewide/pix/favicon.ico" alt="image">  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/">ISN</a> :: <a href="http://trendclub.ru/">TrendClub</a> <br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85538/</a></p>
