      - The first Russian tests of the processor Intel Core i7 980X (Gulftown and Westmere); <br>  - information about the beginning of sales of Intel Core i7 930; <br>  - Asus is a version of the Radeon HD5970 - Ares; <br>  - At CeBIT 2010, MSI will present a PC monoblock with a 3-D screen; <br>  - Photos of EVGA W555 board with support for two Gulftown processors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>First tests Intel Core i7 980X (Gulftown)</b> <br><br>  Members of the <a href="http://occlub.ru/">OCClub.ru</a> team <a href="http://occlub.ru/">were the</a> first in Russia to have at their disposal a sample of a new six-core Intel Core i7 980X processor.  The engineering version is a solution for Xeon DP server machines (Westmere core), which is a complete analogue of the Gulftown desktop solution.  Here are the first tests: <br><br><img src="http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/7190/70563842.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For stability at 4 GHz, the processor required a voltage of 1.28 V. Not all motherboards have support for these processors, this problem is solved by updating the BIOS.  We used the Asus Rampage II Extreme motherboard with BIOS version 1802. The result in the wPime 32M multithreaded test was 4.234 seconds.  To obtain a similar result, quad-core Intel Core i7 920, 950, 960, 975 processors required a clock frequency above 5500 MHz. <br><br><img src="http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/7392/23035441.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 3DMark05, the result on a single Radeon HD5870 video card was 31857 3DMarks.  Due to the lower frequency of Uncore, the result was slightly weaker than on Bloomfield processors.  Let me remind you that the Uncore frequency on Bloomfield processors is set twice as high as the frequency of the RAM, and for Gulftown the frequency is set as one and a half times more.  Due to the lower frequency of the memory controller, new processors in certain applications may yield to Bloomfield processors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fce/864/49e/fce86449e02e7b48627ed17a10de98c3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 3DMark Vantage, the result was 23192 3DMarks, which is a very good and high result for such a frequency.  No wonder, because Vantage works fine with all the cores, so the result in the CPU test turned out to be just crazy. <br><br>  <b>Intel Core i7 930 Now Available</b> <br><br>  Today was the start for the start of sales of the new processor from Intel - Core i7 930. February 28, 2010 - the date of the official announcement of the processor Intel Core i7-930.  The novelty has not yet reached Russia, but the Europeans, who were eagerly waiting for the novelty, can realize their dreams today.  After all, the processors have already appeared on the shelves of European stores. <br><br>  Core i7-930 is made according to the standards of 45 nm process technology and has four physical cores operating at a frequency of 2.8 GHz (133 MHz x 21) with the included Turbo Boost up to 3.06 GHz (133 MHz x 23).  Like its predecessor, the Core i7-920, the newbie has 8 MB of third-level cache and supports Hyper-Threading.  TDP Core i7-930 is 130 watts. <br><br>  The cost of this CPU is 254.86 euros, which is about 25 euros more expensive than the previous Core i7-920 model. <br><br>  <b>Asus introduces the Radeon HD5970 version codenamed Ares</b> <br><br>  In the last couple of months, the release of non-reference versions of video cards has become quite popular.  Video card manufacturers realized that products that differ only in bundling can no longer interest users.  The engineers of the companies started processing the reference designs, and we saw the MSI Lighting series, Gigabyte Super OverClock.  Now Asus has introduced a map from the Republic of Gamers series - Asus Radeon HD5970 Ares. <br><br><img src="http://www.occlub.ru/images/posts/02_10/asus_hd_5970_rog_01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The image of the prototype video card looks quite attractive and productive.  According to the developers, the map turned out to be twenty-five percent faster than the standard.  After all, the frequencies of the graphics processor and memory were increased from 725 MHz and 1000 MHz to 850 MHz and 1200 MHz, respectively. <br><br>  <b>Monoblock from MSI with 3-D screen at CeBIT 2010</b> <br><br>  The CeBIT 2010 exhibition is eagerly awaited by everyone who has the slightest relation to IT technologies.  After all, it is from Hannover that the most interesting news is waiting for us in the near future.  So it became known that the company MSI plans to present the PC in the form factor "monoblock", so even with a 3-D screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d27/89b/f7a/d2789bf7ac09d00276b807fb3b43ab7f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Monoblock MSI offers to use as a home media center.  Monoblock with a 3D-screen will be the first of its kind.  The volume effect should be provided by a panel with a frequency of 120 Hz and shutter-type glasses. <br><br>  <b>EVGA W555 board for real enthusiasts</b> <br><br>  The EVGA company clearly targeted the enthusiast market.  Following the popular line of Classified developers presented a motherboard with two sockets LGA1366.  Such a board can be the basis of a fairly powerful server.  After all, it is focused on working with the new six-core processors Gulftown and Westmere. <br><br><img src="http://xs.to/image-A31C_4B48EF0F.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  12 slots for RAM, 7 slots for PCI-Express, digital power circuit - the combination of high quality and uniqueness of this line-up is of great interest among the public. <br><br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0187/11_10.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The price of new items has not yet been disclosed, but according to preliminary information, it can reach $ 1000. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85874/</a></p>
