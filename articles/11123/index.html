  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unobtrusive Google service, or Back to the USSR</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>If this article were intended for an American audience, I would probably use ‚ÄúNo AdSense for you!‚Äù As a subtitle.</em>  <em>NEXT! ‚ÄùTo everyone here everything at once would be clear.</em>  <em>This phrase, uttered by a character in one of the series of a popular television series, is no less known in America than, say, Pearl Stirlitz and Muller on the other side of the ocean.</em>  <em>The plot of the series in question is very simple.</em>  <em>One immigrant, whom the heroes of the series nicknamed Soup Nazi, opened a small restaurant in New York, where he prepared an amazing and at the same time very cheap soup using a unique recipe.</em>  <em>The demand for this product was such that there was always a long line at the entrance to the restaurant.</em>  <em>It would be more tolerable if it were not for the almost ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù (according to the heroes) orders that the owner introduced in his establishment.</em>  <em>Any, the smallest violation of the rules of conduct in the restaurant led to the immediate removal of the offender from the premises without the right to use the services of the restaurant for one year.</em>  <em>The punishment was accompanied by a terrible exclamation of the host: ‚ÄúNo soup for you!</em>  <em>NEXT! "</em> <br><br>  And we recalled the common image of Soup Nazi with its ‚ÄúNo soup‚Äù when we received a letter from Google.  In it, iTech Bridge as a partner of the affiliate (as Google calls it) the AdSense program reported that for some violations of the rules of the "partnership" we are no longer partners.  No details: what exactly are the rules, what and when did we break them?  As you know, under this program, Google places contextual advertising of clients on sites, paying their owners a certain percentage of the income received from this advertisement.  So, in the indictment letter it was stated that we violated something in the part of the ‚Äúunauthorized‚Äù placement of banners and forced ‚Äúclicks‚Äù on them.  No specifics! <br><br>  Since we did not notice such sins for ourselves, at first we took everything quite calmly: we thought that it was a mistake.  Everything happens, about what they wrote in the response letter.  So, they say, and so, explain, please.  It was not there - the answer came instantly that the appeal should be submitted via the web, and indicated the address of the page with the appropriate form.  The mood began to deteriorate: the appeal - immediately you begin to feel like a defendant. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Fill out the form.  A few days later we received the answer: the appeal was rejected, the verdict was final and could not be appealed.  Everything - ‚ÄúNo AdSense for you!  " <br><br>  All <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D22453">letters</a> from Google are written in the spirit of typical American business correspondence.  Very polite: both ‚ÄúThank you for your appeal‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWe appreciate your understanding‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSincerely‚Äù.  There is everything that is needed, there is only the essence.  One gets the impression that Google robots not only search, manage AdSense and other programs, are responsible for sending emails, but also compose them. <br><br>  Yes, monopolism is a terrible thing!  Not without reason, American consumer protection societies and "antitrasovtsy" became interested in the activities of the main Internet detective.  At the same time, it doesn‚Äôt matter what origin of this monopolism: capitalist or socialist.  After all, many of us who still remember all the delights of unobtrusive service in the former Soviet Union are very familiar with Soup Nazi.  Be it in the guise of the director of the dining room with his "we did not invite you here" or the shop saleswomen with her "you are many, and I am one."  At the same time, unlike the Americans, for the first time we found out about it not from TV shows. <br><br>  <em>An extended version of this note with all links and applications is posted on my iTech Bridge <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D22453">blog</a> .</em> <br><br>  PS Thank you to the new form for posting.  Still habracut there ... and a couple of emoticons :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11123/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11123/</a></p>
