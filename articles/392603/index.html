This is evidenced by the study, which was attended by eighty world-class athletes.  The study revealed a significant difference at the cellular level in the muscles of athletes and people leading a less active lifestyle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a2/975/ce4/9a2975ce49e4914db725435c351c256c.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Healthy muscles are necessary for a person to feel better in old age.  After 50 years, the amount of muscle tissue begins to decline actively, and by the age of 70-80 years, the strength indicators of people are reduced by half compared to 35 years of age. <br><br>  Muscles are composed of fibers, each of which is connected with the motor neuron in the spine with the help of an axon - neuritis, that is, a long cylindrical process of the nerve cell.  The neuron sends a command to the fiber to move, the fiber responds to the command and your leg is on the eyelid, finger, or any other part of the body, it moves.

      But motor neurons die with age, starting at 30 years of age, leaving muscle fibers isolated from the nervous system.  In a young body, another neuron may come to the rescue, again connecting the fiber to the nervous system, but with each decade this possibility decreases.  And the fibers die off, we lose muscle mass, become frail and frail - especially after 60 years.  Scientists do not know yet whether it is possible to slow down or change this process. <br><br>  In 2010, universities in Canada and the United Kingdom <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20142771">conducted a study</a> in which professional runners aged 65, ordinary 65-year-olds and 25-year-olds took part.  Then they found out that older athletes in the legs have much more muscle fibers connected to the nervous system. <br><br>  To conduct a new <a href="">study of the</a> Canadian McGill University, scientists have invited 29 world-class athletes aged 80 years.  The control group included less active people of the same age.  In the laboratory, all participants pressed their feet onto the platform with all their might, and during this process, scientists monitored electrical activity inside the leg muscles using sensors. <br><br>  Scientists have determined that athletes, on average, are 25% stronger able to put pressure on the platform, and they have 14% more muscle mass than people in the control group. <br><br>  But the most important thing is that athletes had 30% more fibers connected to the nervous system.  The control group often observed signals that simply did not reach the fiber.  Such signals occur when the motor neuron is almost not working.  Athletes' leg muscles were healthier at the cellular level. <br><br>  Geoffrey Power, the author of the study, <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/exercise-makes-our-muscles-work-better-with-age/">noted</a> that older athletes have better muscles than people who are ten years younger. <br><br>  Due to a small sample, this study cannot be considered absolutely true proof that any person practicing any exercises will age later than others.  These athletes, in their 80s, do several hours a week.  Fortunately, some of them discovered the sport after 50 years - so we have a chance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392603/</a></p>
