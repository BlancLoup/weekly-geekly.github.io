After all, knowledge - here they are, just lie at your feet, take it and use it.  My friends decided to make a contribution to this direction and to organize training for QA-automators in a serious way, with selection and a course on quality.  What happened in the end can be read under the cut from the first person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2fb/648/9ed/2fb6489ededd979f8eae57b880cd0900.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Intro </h4><br>  How often do you remember your way to the first serious work?  I am not talking about the road to the office, but about what I had to learn, learn and learn to do, in order to finally go through this cherished interview and get the desired position of the junior.  I have to think about it quite often, because  It was hard to answer the questions and spent a lot of effort, not to mention time.  I still think that the reason for this is the absence of a person who could tell what was the main and secondary thing at that stage.

      Perhaps it was this circumstance that served as a starting point for me in knowledge sharing and teaching beginners in the field of testing and automation.  Sometimes he accompanied individuals in training, sometimes groups with the support of companies in which he worked.  But I always wanted to hold a training event aimed specifically at students, without being tied to any company that would dictate terms for the curriculum, etc. <br><br>  This is how the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconducting the Automation Test Course 2013 (ATC 2013) was born. <br><br><h4>  Training </h4><br>  So in August 2013, Vlad and I decided to conduct a course for students.  The goal was one - to teach a group of n people (for n&gt; 1) to automate the testing of web applications.  We didn‚Äôt talk about the training program, the venue ... The only thing that really worried us was when we started? <br><br>  Based on the target audience, they decided to start in early October so that all potential participants have already joined the educational process at universities and could attend our classes without any damage to their studies at universities. <br>  Assessing his personal strength and approximate loading at our work sites, made up a schedule of classes for the entire course and prepared its structure. <br><br>  Next on the list of urgent matters was the creation of a <a href="http://atc2013.github.io/info/">page</a> with information about the course and a form for submitting applications.  Here Vlad had to practice his skills as a coder and JS dev.  Filled on Git Pages before September 1st, as planned.  Everything went according to schedule. <br><br>  Traffic for the page was mined from VK, Twitter'a, DOU. <br><br>  The issue of the study room was solved by good people from my former company Levi9 Ukraine.  This event served as a point in preparation for ATC 2013. The next stage will be devoted to interviews with candidates. <br><br><h4>  Selection </h4><br>  During the month we received more than 80 applications for participation in the course.  Interviews I spent on Skype from the calculation of 30 minutes per candidate.  This time with the head was enough to tell in more detail about our course and find out information about the person.  The main criterion was the desire to learn.  Someone will ask, how can this be verified?  For me, the answer is simple - if the applicant already has a part of the knowledge that he acquired as a result of independent work, then this is an indicator. <br><br>  When it came time to sum up the results and decide on the formation of the group, it turned out that we had 8 lucky ones.  Almost all were students of the KPI.  We replenished a group of 6 people from Levi9.  Total 14 people. <br>  A side effect was that after the first few days of interviews I was already, as if the Oriflame consultant was talking about our course in the first two minutes of the conversation. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-Sg7hqQqas%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjbNxulBXrluK-Qb-A_wHUuc3NFsA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Training </h4><br>  In October, the first part of the PBX began.  She was devoted to the theory of software testing.  Gradually passed the main topics: <br><ul><li>  Software life cycle </li><li>  Types of testing </li><li>  Test cases </li><li>  Bugs </li><li>  Work with requirements </li></ul><br>  The list is far from complete, but the main thing is that in three weeks the children took part in practical exercises, teamwork and received homework.  All these activities helped them as clearly as possible to feel what the work of the tester is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fba/554/94c/fba55494c1408d3e94daf38b09295bb4.jpg"><br><br>  After a rich first stage, when the group was completely involved in the educational process, we moved on to automation.  The task was extremely simple - to teach how to create a framework based on the Page Object pattern using Java, TestNG and WebDriver.  I decided to go the evolutionary way.  We started with tasks that can be solved by automation, and then practiced with Selenium IDE, writing simple test scripts, with Selenium RC &amp; Java well, and in the final we reached the main goal of building a framework.  Each following method of automation eliminated the shortcomings of the previous one. <br><br><h4>  Completion </h4><br>  After six weeks the course ended, the graduates found jobs.  It's like a good American movie.  We, in turn, learned from conducting such events.  Very pleased with the result of the work done.  We hope that in the near future, one of the participants of the PBX will be in our teams, because they no longer have to explain those seemingly obvious things that newcomers so often lack because no one suggested to them in due time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a1/3c8/f9f/8a13c8f9f60b4e47b640b6b7165c731f.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209852/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209852/</a></p>
