After searching for the reason in Google, I eventually found that chkdsk was most likely to blame - under some conditions, the $ system file is damaged and, as a result, after fixing it, chkdsk flies the rights to all files on the damaged disk.  As a result, when trying to login, Windows cannot read profile files, since  access to them is not due to incorrect rights and hangs on it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Do you think I'm gonna complain about which windows is bad <s>and, well, as usual, it's time to blame on Linux (s)</s> ?  Nothing like this.  I will tell you about UI and software. <br><br>  Situation: Windows 8 gave a blue screen and rebooted.  What happens next?  That's right - running chkdsk.  But you will not know about it - no information about it is displayed on the screen, the standard slider is just spinning and that's it.  What happens, why the hard disk indicator is lit, when it will all end and what to do is unknown.  Those.  even the ancient Windows XP at least displayed the percentages of the operation, but the new, modern OS does not know how, in principle.  I‚Äôm not saying that no one knows what time this process will take at all.

      Let's not invent something exotic, simply: let's say a modern computer with a 3-4 TB hard drive was bought in the store.  Naturally, the hard drive no one bothered to divide into sections.  Estimate the time to check such a disk.  Bonus - and if there are several?  What do you think - a couple of hours is enough?  And all this time we will look at the spinning points.  Usability, aha. <br><br>  Anyway.  As I said, we have a problem - Windows cannot login to the desktop.  Because it is impossible to read the files in the user profile, because there are no rights.  OS actions?  Well, I think you already guessed?  That's right - spinning dots and black screen!  Wait for an answer ... <br><br>  Well, let's say you still have administrative skills.  Your next steps - start the OS in safe mode.  Thinking about it?  FIG!  Because the OS wants you to select a profile under which you need to login - at the same time there are no profiles in the list (well, because the OS does not have read permissions, this is logical). <br><br>  There is a wonderful point where you can ask the Windows to try to fix it yourself.  Does not help. <br><br>  Do you think recovery using the command line will help you?  FIG!  No profiles for login. <br><br>  What else do we have there?  Remarkable points: demolish everything, put bare windows, reinstall windows on top of the current one (minus the driver and some software), restore from the control point (oh! Windows for some reason does not make control points at all, bummer), restore from backup (bummer: backup I have acronis) <br><br>  Almost every item one way or another leads to a reboot.  4-core Athlon II x64 635 2.9 GHz - 10-15 minutes for each failed attempt. <br><br>  Okay, spit on trying to fix the system, we want to restore from backup. <br><br>  Situation: there is a tablet on the android, a deadly Windows and installation disks with different versions of Windows + LiveCD.  You need to get to the backup that acronis did and restore the system from it.  Need Windows, Windows does not work, because  can not log in, without Windows Acronis does not work.  Livecd?  not working, not that version.  There is nothing to record a disk - there is no network, there are no utilities for recording, there is no Windows <s>‚Äúselect any two‚Äù (c)</s> <br><br>  In the end, of course, I did it: put a new windows on another disk, put an acronym in it, deploy from backup and voila - we are working!  It's not about that.  I'm talking about software and UI. <br><br><h4>  Windows </h4><br>  1. Tiles!  Everyone loves tiles! <br>  I am sure you will be delighted with the choice of language with the help of tiles.  You also need to enter a password - and the default language is Russian.  Vertical list of tiles with the names of languages.  ALL LANGUAGES.  There are just a bunch of screens (the same tiles!).  English - he is the USA, i.e.  This is somewhere in the middle of the list - scroll. <br><br>  2. Progressbar?  What are you, this is not modern.  And in general - any operation should be performed instantly, so the rotating points - it will be beautiful and modern.  And you can and generally do not display anything, why?  The operation can not take a lot of time!  Downloading the windows 8 installer from DVD - 15 minutes black screen, another 5-10 minutes nice blue screen, then a dialog box appears. <br><br>  3. How long will the surgery take?  And the FIG knows, in 90% of cases, even percentages are not displayed, and you also want the time forecast, so what?  This is not modern. <br><br><h4>  Acronis </h4><br>  1. Recovering from backup without having a native livecd or live windows?  No, you do not need it. <br><br>  2. Progressbar?  ABOUT!  There is.  Only useless.  Estimate of time is missing, well at least there is interest. <br><br>  3. There is an image of the system partition, poklasterny.  I want to restore 4 folders.  2013, the FIG knows what the acronis version is.  Can you imagine - she does not know how to restore simlinks !?  -2 hours of life. <br><br>  4. Select folders to restore.  Undoubtedly, the size of folders for recovery is vital information, so it should be considered with every click.  Chose another folder - recalculate.  The interface is hanging, we are busy - we think!  2013, yes.  Usability, ui ... <br><br>  5. cm p.3 - it was not possible to restore the pop-up; the entire profile is on simlinks.  Spit, restore the entire section.  Some kind of pathetic 111 GB.  SSD drive.  -2.5 hours of time. <br><br>  6. Acronis backups do not work in the restored OS.  Those.  it starts, makes a backup (!), swears that it did not find the file of the previous archive (53rd, and it does the 55th one) - and ... right!  "Backup failed, see the error on the site."  I think you have already guessed that the link given by the acronym itself is a 404th error? <br><br>  So, the simplest task: ‚Äúthere is a dead Windows, you need to repair or restore it from backup‚Äù - this is minus 10 hours of life. <br><br>  Progress, yes.  2013, fast computers, yeah. <br><br>  PS: why am I writing all this?  Programmers, think again!  Keep logs, write intelligible errors, make progressbars, ideally also counting the time of the operation.  And in general, I get the impression that no one else can count percents - open a book, read, it's elementary! <br><br>  PPS: I bought a new Philips Philips TV here, also in 2013, yes.  He scrolls movies for 10 seconds.  Yes, even the stupid DVD player of the 2000s release was able to use fast playback to scroll.  TV 2013 release can scroll for 10 seconds with a pause of half a second.  And sometimes he loses the network, and in the background the film continues to play.  Restart - scrolling half of the film (40-60 minutes for 10 seconds with pauses) - view.  Usability is the same as FIG. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202146/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202146/</a></p>
