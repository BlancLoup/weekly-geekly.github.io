I am a product manager in Tutu and I like to tell that it is important to first understand why you are writing something at all, then formulate the requirements for the result, and then do it.  As an example, I often cite the office kitchen.  Now on the fingers I will tell you what a grocery approach is, how to make a kitchen with it, and what is going on in our real kitchen in the office. <br><br>  Every thing has a user.  The kitchen end users - office staff.  They use the kitchen to get value.  It is for the value they come.  For example, we have a fridge free food: yogurt, various snacks such as carrots, cottage cheese, sausages, pizza and pies, that is, snacks fast or healthy.  Here he is: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pn/2o/as/pn2oaslssogpa488-bralgven9y.jpeg">

      Where did he come from?  From the simple thought that sometimes people leave the office to eat something outside.  The nearest store is 10 minutes from the office (taking into account the descent-ascent).  It is much cheaper and more practical to bring employees free food than to spend their time searching for it, albeit not at the company's expense.  At first it was only healthy snacks, but then as the office grew sausages began to appear, and for those who sometimes have to wait for the night before release, pizza.  At the same time, hot food is not stored here permanently, but comes separately. <br><br>  Let us analyze how such a decision could have been made at all. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Above, we have described end users.  To understand why they need a product, it is necessary to describe what tasks they want to solve.  From the kitchen it can be: <br><br><ul><li>  A place to eat. </li><li>  Negotiation for quick meetings when everything else is taken. </li><li>  Sit and do something outside of your workplace. </li><li>  Sit with friends in the evening after work. </li><li>  Stop and unwind after a block of work. </li><li>  Get a cup of coffee so as not to fall asleep before a night rollout (this happens about once every two months). </li></ul><br>  Since this is our third office and the product "kitchen" intersects with other products of the office, we already know the limitations of the kitchen and other ways to solve the problems of users.  For example, we will not do the talk from the kitchen.  We have normal conversations and small niches like a train compartment are scattered around the office to sit and talk.  For those who like to work on the go, there are very small places like an airplane seat, table and sockets.  And so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ut/sd/aw/utsdawoyqtwbkn_rgnm7pd0lvqk.jpeg"><br><br>  We as a company want the following from the kitchen: <br><br><ol><li>  So that people do not carry food to workplaces (it is very distracting and annoying to many). </li><li>  For employees to leave the office less in search of food or for organized dinners, since going out and entering the building from the 12th floor takes about 10 minutes plus time to go to the store.  The hypothesis is that if we lay out products for free, then we will save the 15-20 minutes that the employee will devote to work. </li><li>  So that it would be nice to be there, because one of the tasks is comfort in the office.  In general, in any place with a sufficient concentration of IT-specialists, sooner or later they make comfort, this is an important requirement for reducing turnover. </li><li>  So that people do not wait around coffee machines, coolers and other nodes, because it directly affects the efficiency of work. </li></ol><br>  Cynical objectification: we want maximum output, loyalty and ultimately money for the company from the kitchen.  And this can be done by turning it into a comfortable, cozy place.  If you think in advance. <br><br>  Next, we write out the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat we want to receive from the product (this is an incomplete list): <br><br><ol><li>  A place where you can eat healthy food every day. </li><li>  No waiting. </li><li>  Always available quick snack. </li><li>  Keep your food and use the total. </li><li>  Sit with friends in the evening after work. </li><li>  Stop and unwind after a block of work. </li><li>  Hold a meeting with a busy negotiation. </li><li>  Cozy and relatively cute. </li></ol><br><h3>  Farther </h3><br>  Now for each value we prescribe measuring instruments.  They must be specific.  For example, ‚Äúno waiting‚Äù is ‚Äútime to get a glass of coffee should not be more than two minutes‚Äù or ‚Äútime to drink coffee takes on average no more than 50% of the time to take and drink it‚Äù. <br><br>  According to the metrics, you can disassemble the number of empty seats, permeability, the number of food decreasing in the refrigerator in sweets and cookies, its distribution, etc. <br><br>  From these measurements, the project backlog and requirements for it are added.  Examples of what happened with us: <br><br><ol><li>  The kitchen should be as possible in the geometric center of the office.  The most frequent request - water - should be solved at all points in the office by separate coolers: </li></ol><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cv/ze/dp/cvzedpykvab0rnhthowffnbqid0.jpeg"><br><br>  2. You need six microwaves: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7d/vm/5h/7dvm5h7ob8olhhqaeztk6to0txi.jpeg"><br><br>  We calculated the number of microwaves empirically: we extrapolated the data on the number of people in the new office (now we have 370 people, of which 170 are IT specialists) and took into account the geometry of the kitchen. <br><br>  A coffee machine needs one in terms of speed metrics, but in terms of user requirements, two.  Because in one - arabica, in the other - a mixture with robusta. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f2/uv/km/f2uvkmkitf5gttm99cxlhpddpj4.jpeg"><br><br>  2-3 variants of syrup should always be near, two points of tea of ‚Äã‚Äã12 varieties, three types of sugar (regular, cane and sweetener), honey and lemon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kx/mm/ku/kxmmkulfxs9poolslieng4tn0vy.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qp/ku/lb/qpkulbbagu0femjqru9rwmqqwv8.jpeg"><br><br>  3. The most convenient way is to hire an employee who will wash the dishes and do other things in the kitchen, so as not to waste the expensive time of the developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pj/03/2v/pj032vkb7r3hwrubl8fs2uxp_oi.jpeg"><br><br>  But these things still need to wash themselves: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xd/1b/pl/xd1bplocsyekwpbkx8ljvwdg5-s.jpeg"><br><br>  We have a lot of common dishes (users both bring their own and use a general office), so the dishwasher should work in the scalding mode with hot steam for disinfection every time. <br><br>  4. You can cook yourself.  This immediately means a slab and a change in infrastructure requirements (then it will be more difficult to build in a hood and observe fire safety, so you need to think about it when repairing an office): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cq/fe/py/cqfepyltqgnav2lt4yhvh1q34im.jpeg"><br><br>  5. We follow the behavior of users.  Most often, they cooked eggs for breakfast, so you need to get eggs and egg cooker.  You also need to decompose fruit in the morning, in the afternoon - various quick snacks and cookies, and make dinner cutting greens and vegetables for dinner: all this adds value to users and works on the tasks of the product‚Äôs stakeholders.  Nothing personal, this is business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qs/1b/hn/qs1bhn6seppb39fet6xntsyh7co.jpeg"><br><br>  6. Product use metrics suggest that you need three refrigerators. <br><br>  7. The most frequent operation in the new kitchen is transferring cookies from the drive to the table.  It can be simplified by creating small jars for cookies and other things directly on the tables.  The specific contents of the drives must be rotated so that people do not get used to the same baking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2v/q5/hp/2vq5hpk_rx0ft7gkedfnxf6odey.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4e/i1/6j/4ei16jwb4byoyfvtbewfbwn0kfw.jpeg"><br><br>  Is it done?  Not. <br><br>  The next stage is product development.  There is always a gap between plans and the real world.  Users change preferences, behavior, and so on.  The main changes occur almost immediately after launch, and smooth - constantly as the project develops.  This means that the kitchen must have a specific person in charge (and usually this is not an office manager), and it must have metrics for how everything goes successfully.  One of the metrics can be feedback about satisfaction (employees give feedback), and the rest of the numerical - in the form of service time, the absence of "traffic jams" and so on. <br><br>  We are responsible for the kitchen Guzel, the head of the <abbr title="Administrative department">AHO</abbr> .  She knows, up to a kilogram, seasonal fluctuations in fruit consumption, knows the costs of all liquids and snacks in refrigerators, accurately predicts the demand for different foods (to get the right amount of different types of meals when ordering hot) and so on. <br><br>  From the experience of supporting the product "kitchen" she learned the following: <br><br><ol><li>  If you try to influence the users so that they get accustomed to a healthy diet, and gradually remove the sausage from the assortment of snacks, the ‚Äúsausage riot‚Äù will rise.  Therefore, a compromise is to choose at least sausage from meat and other normal products.  Introduced porridge. </li><li>  In the evenings, people linger on the pizza-party - we need large tables (we designed them right away, but for another). </li><li>  Need an interface reorder products.  This is either a chat on the wall in the spirit of ‚Äúwhat else is needed‚Äù, or people just come up and say: ‚ÄúGuzel, let's put olive oil‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe need natural peanut paste‚Äù.  Yoghurts, kefir, cheese, curds were added to the assortment. </li><li>  The dishes should not be placed directly in the dishwashers, but should be put in the sink, otherwise the door will simply be broken off.  Need clustering by loading. </li><li> Milk caused the most questions.  Very long chose the best brand.  Guzel had previously worked at Kompari (product comparison service), so in the end we buy Parmalat: it was the best in the blind tests of the Rospotrebnadzor laboratory.  To taste, it also suits everyone. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fp/xb/z1/fpxbz1qc7wyga1tjy-krbuuxk6u.jpeg"><br><br>  About a similar vote was for the brand of bottled water. <br><br><h3>  Is it possible to shift this approach somewhere else? </h3><br>  Yes. <br><br>  For all.  A simple tool from a combination of identifying users, their tasks and necessary values, building metrics and breaking it up into back-up tasks gives clarity anywhere. <br><br>  Example: here are the performance metrics at the start of a new internal project.  Suppose I am going to make an inspiring speech and recruit people within the company to my team.  I have a presentation, but I don't like it.  I apply the product approach, form the tasks from him that are needed to finalize the presentation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rm/ee/bz/rmeebzor0jzahldyxhfkqwip_ro.png"><br><br>  You can and in the family, and anywhere else.  The main thing is to remember about three limitations: <br><br><ol><li>  All that I have just described is a very superficial vision of the instrument, because the complete methodology is much more extensive and more complex.  But the main thing I told. </li><li>  It does not stand where emotions are involved (for example, in a family), to talk about exactly how you came to your conclusions.  Because the fact that for many is a nice cozy kitchen, for us in practice is a commercial tool with measurable efficiency.  But much nicer not to mention about it once again. </li><li>  There are projects / products where you do not want to consider metrics for achieving the goal, because you like the process.  Then just enjoy. </li></ol><br>  Who is interested in more about the product approach for everything in a row, I can advise Marty Cagan‚Äôs book entitled ‚ÄúInspired: How To Create Products Customers Love‚Äù and the podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ru/podcast/make-sense-podcast/id1417851966%3Fmt%3D2">make sense</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458452/</a></p>
