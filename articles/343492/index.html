  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How is the Hamster Marketplace token different from other project tokens?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hamster Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace for unique gadgets and indie electronics manufacturers.  We hope that the platform will become a home for those who cannot withstand the marketing competition with giant manufacturers like Apple or Samsung.  Also, Hamster Marketplace will help those who are lost behind the information noise created by many dealers and manufacturers from China who stamp faceless replicas of popular devices.  The target audience of the Hamster Marketplace is geeks and innovation lovers, on both sides of the virtual counter.  We will be equally happy with both buyers who are looking for unusual things, and indie manufacturers - yesterday's startups from Kickstarter, Indiegogo and other crowdfunding platforms around the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i4/gy/mi/i4gymi-fbkyrqw_i4wapgig7un4.jpeg"><br><br>  Now Hamster Marketplace goes to the crowdfunding <a href="https://hmstr.io/">fundraising through the sale of tokens</a> .  But what distinguishes us from our own customers in the face of indie producers?  First of all - an experienced team.  The project's CEO, Denis Bulavin, already has experience in creating a production line for a niche electrical product and working with large retail chains.  The founder's experience is supported by a powerful team, which, coupled with an understanding of the needs of the audience and manufacturers, makes the project profitable.

      As they say, the devil is in the details.  Today we will not talk about the global strategy of the Hamster Marketplace, forecasts or promote any ideas.  Instead, we‚Äôll tell you about the most important part of any token allocation.  However, other projects diligently avoid this topic, limiting themselves to general phrases and technical data on the type of smart contract.  We will talk about the features of our HMT token, namely about how it differs from the tokens of other projects and what we have done for this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  HMT - Hamster Marketplace Token </h2><br>  As any theater begins with a hanger, any placement begins with a token.  This is the main tool, that allows you to collect the necessary amount of the project.  At the same time, the token acts as a tool for attracting funding from interested parties and at the same time it is a guarantee obligation to the participants of the fundraising campaign. <br><br><h4>  HMT Token Issue </h4><br>  During the placement, Hamster Marketplace (HMT) tokens will be sold at a fixed price of $ 2.  The maximum number of tokens available for purchase is 14 million pieces, that is, the collection ceiling is $ 28 million. Regardless of the volume of tokens sold (softcap is set at $ 2 million), the number sold is 70%.  Additionally released 30% will be distributed as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  27.5% of tokens are distributed among the team, founders, consultants and early buyers of tokens; </li><li>  2.5% of tokens are distributed as rewards for participation in the bounty program (if the hunters want to get tokens, and not an equivalent in Fiat). </li></ul><br>  Here one more feature of HMT tokens is revealed: they do not necessarily fall into the hands of bounty-hunters, who then collapse the course on the exchange with the same tokens.  The founders of the project provided an alternative way to reward participants in the bounty program.  Instead of HMT, they can get fiat money at face value (1 HMT = $ 2). <br><br>  The Hamster Marketplace token will be available for free exchange and bargaining on the main cryptocurrency exchanges.  Of course, the additional issue of the HMT after the crowdfunding campaign, a smart contract is not provided. <br><br><h4>  We as NASA - do not abandon their </h4><br>  It often happens that the project founders view the token simply as a tool to attract money.  Without obligations.  This is such a typical situation when a person sees only what he wants to see.  Right now we are talking about fraud and fraud in the entire sphere.  Due to the fact that the authors do not give a damn about the further fate of their token (almost all projects send it to ‚Äúfree floating‚Äù on the stock exchanges, where it is expected to go to the bottom), they don‚Äôt talk about it.  And in the end it turns out "Houston, we have a problem!". <br><br>  And here we come to the following thesis: the HMT token is special and stands out from the coins of other projects, because we don‚Äôt give a damn about its fate after the end of trading. <br><br>  The project team has provided a range of measures that will ensure the sustainability of the HMT course after the end of the placement, and eliminate panic in the ranks of token holders.  Even successful projects now suffer from the fact that short-sighted or just nerve holders are starting to ‚Äúdump‚Äù their coins on the stock exchange, wanting to ‚Äúget out‚Äù faster, despite financial losses due to the difference between the nominal and stock value of the token.  Most of these ‚Äúgestures‚Äù are supported by multiple rumors, for example: ‚Äúthe project is fraud!‚Äù, ‚ÄúHunters are crushing the market!‚Äù Or ‚Äúthe founders themselves are dropping their coins!‚Äù.  Subjectively, all these rumors have some ground under them.  Therefore, as mentioned earlier, we eliminate pressure on the token from the bounty hunters, and freeze tokens for up to 9 months, which will be distributed between the founders and team members. <br><br>  Such steps will help the HMT and calm down the holders, because the only tokens available for free circulation for more than half a year are exclusively the tokens of the participants. <br><br><h4>  There is no "who is the extreme for tokens?".  Admission by appointment only. </h4><br>  What is the current placement of tokens in terms of audience?  This is a salad of experienced crypto players, companies that are looking for where to invest in a relatively short position and classic ‚Äúmimocrocodiles‚Äù - random people who spontaneously decided to ‚Äúbuy hundreds of hard-earned coins‚Äù in pursuit of easy money. <br><br>  The whole strategy of our project involves patience.  Random people who spontaneously make a purchase of a token at face value, without having enough experience and understanding of what is happening, eventually turn into toxic Vainers.  They also generate a number of questionable rumors, put pressure on the token, dropping it below par, which causes a chain reaction. <br><br>  And this is another feature of our token.  In order to exclude "mimocrocodiles", the emphasis at the placement of tokens will be on participants who have passed the preliminary registration.  Thus, not too much HMT will fall into the hands of random people, who by their inexperience or short-sightedness could put pressure on the course, depriving not only themselves, but also other token-holders of profits. <br><br>  By the way, you can already register for the purchase of HMT tokens on the <a href="https://hmstr.io/">official website</a> . <br><br><h4>  Say no! Crutches and cycling </h4><br>  Embedding a token into an ecosystem of a conditional project that has been released on a crowdfunding fundraiser is often similar to the crutches-bikes game that all programmers love.  In order to somehow justify the existence of the token and give meaning to its existence, the authors of the projects izglyatsya in the ways of its introduction into the mechanics of their offspring.  Frankly, it turns out far from all.  And if someone succeeds, then often the token looks foreign, thus a ‚Äúcrutch‚Äù. <br><br>  In our case, the use of the HMT token in the mechanics of the Hamster Marketplace has a simple but elegant goal: to collect as much as possible and burn.  A number of services for sellers can only be obtained for the HMT, which, falling into the hands of the administration, will be sent to the furnace without regret.  Why do we do this?  Humanity already has a huge number of financial instruments: plastic cards, cashless payments, bank transfers, electronic money (PayPal, JAD, WM, and at least QIWI), a whole host of cryptocurrencies.  Those projects that tie up the work of their service to the constant circulation of tokens within the site only generate another mediator between fiat / cryptocurrency and its recipient, which does not add comfort to the latter.  We believe that it is not necessary to force everyone into a ‚Äúcoitus‚Äù with the HMT: only some of the sellers will ‚Äúsuffer‚Äù. <br><br>  But the main feature of the HMT token is the viable product that stands behind it.  Hamster Marketplace is a working trading platform whose issues are not sucked from the finger.  The need for such a platform is long overdue, which, together with the experience of our team and the feedback from experienced crypto players, says: HMT stands for a lot more than just a smart contract and a raw idea.  We clearly understand what we should receive in the end, and this understanding gives the whole project a monolithic integrity. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>If you want to get more information about Hamster Marketplace first hand, welcome to our <a href="https://t.me/hmstrRU">Russian-language channel in Telegram</a> .</b></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343492/</a></p>
