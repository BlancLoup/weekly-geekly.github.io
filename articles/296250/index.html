Why is the majority simply writing lyrics and not thinking about their readers?  Where is the imagination and the desire for diversity?  Maybe you need help?  Check it out in this article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5d/4df/9ca/d5d4df9ca50141869eba4f99dccf831a.jpg"><br><br>  Looking at the history of hits on the search phrase "content marketing" we get the following situation:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26a/1da/aea/26a1daaeade74a8a89762b20adb37759.png"><br><br>  A growing trend that is definitely not going to decline. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The absolute values ‚Äã‚Äãare: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fb/1d6/b65/8fb1d6b654a4460688e28dc36d518c75.png"><br><br>  Compared with the previous year, the growth is obvious.  It was especially sharp at the end of 2014. <br><br>  What does this mean? <br><br>  This confirms that companies in the Russian-language Internet have finally begun to pay attention to this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãInternet marketing. <br><br>  By the way, if we started promoting content marketing relatively recently, then abroad this topic has long helped millions of companies increase their competitive advantages.  They give their target audience cool content.  The audience is happy to consume this content.  She has confidence in the company and willingness to pay for quality services. <br><br>  Result? <br><br>  The company receives a loyal and solvent audience.  Well, isn't it a fairy tale? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83b/369/d98/83b369d981c74ae2ac4906ee1dced32d.png"><br><br>  So, having been born in 2005, from 2011-2012 the number of ‚ÄúContent marketing‚Äù search queries grew sharply from year to year.  This trend will continue to grow.  Undoubtedly. <br><br>  When I think about content marketing, Neil Patel and his QuickSprout articles and personal blog immediately come to my mind.  For example, <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2015/08/10/dont-waste-your-time-6-ways-to-be-more-efficient-on-social-media/%3Futm_campaign%3DSubmission%26utm_medium%3DCommunity%26utm_source%3DGrowthHackers.com">an article</a> about optimization of advancement in social networks is a real treasure.  A typical example of proper content marketing.  Detailed descriptions with cases, pictures, tips.  A few thousand words.  More than 2.5 thousand rassharivaniya on the Internet.  Dozens of comments. <br><br>  You just sit down for this article, and begin step by step to do what is written there.  And at this moment you realize how cool and useful it is.  Because you do not need to rummage around Google in search of the necessary information.  All of it has already been passed through the mind and practice of a competent person.  All it is already collected in one place.  Just take it and do it. <br><br>  Looking back at Runet, the first thing that comes to mind when it says ‚Äúcontent marketing‚Äù is Texterra.ru and their ‚Äúpivots‚Äù on their own blog in the spring of 2015.  "There are no passable and mediocre posts, only the most complete and high-quality content."  <a href="http://texterra.ru/blog/sozdanie-teksta-ot-a-do-ya-kak-napisat-optimizirovat-i-sverstat-statyu.html">The last post</a> of September 17 speaks for itself.  30 minutes of reading one very detailed article will replace your hours-long transitions from one site to another in search for information. <br><br>  As far as I know, it was this company that started the first to promote content marketing in RuNet as one of the Internet marketing services.  And they do it very well. <br><br>  It was just an introduction.  I just wanted those who have not yet understood the value of content marketing to finally think about it. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/various/kak-uvelichit-kolichestvo-repostov-kontenta/">How to increase the number of content reposts</a></i> <br><br>  In general, the <b>main purpose of the article is to help you select the appropriate types of content</b> .  I hope this will help to pump out "content marketing" in your project. <br><br><h4>  16 types of content </h4><br><br><h5>  Video Content </h5><br><br>  When reading, only about 20% of all information is remembered.  When viewing video content - about 80%. <br><br>  About 65% of all people are visuals.  They perceive visual information much better than dry text, especially if it is without pictures. <br><br>  Convincing facts? <br><br>  Video content is a great alternative to standard texts.  You can do: <br>  - Reviews of their products / services / projects. <br>  - instructions on the use of your products / services <br>  - viral advertisements that will increase awareness <br>  - webinars <br>  - recording of performances at events <br>  - and other. <br><br>  Any kind of content can be easily integrated into the blog.  Yes, in general, you can stick it in any place on the site, if you really want. <br><br>  Individual attention deserve video interview with famous people who are popular in your field of activity.  Firstly, such interviews often contain a lot of useful information, insiders for your audience.  Secondly, as a rule, the person being interviewed shares it on his channel.  And thanks to this, the reach of the audience, which previously could not know anything about you at all, is expanding. <br><br>  By the way, besides the fact that videos give an influx to an audience that does not like to read, they are also very well ranked in search engines. <br><br>  Video content can then be easily converted to text format and podcasts.  This further increases the value of this type of content. <br><br><h4>  Full manuals in the style of "How to ..." (How to) </h4><br><br>  In my opinion, this is one of the best types of content. <br><br>  Imagine the situation that the user has a question in the style of "How to do ...".  He scores it on Google.  He is issued 10 articles, he opens the first of them and finds a complete answer to his question.  This is what the correct ‚ÄúHow To‚Äù guide should be. <br><br>  The standard structure of such an article is the following: first, the problem / question is raised, and then, step by step, its solution is described.  People love articles of this format.  Believe it.  Everyone likes practical and understandable articles instead of ‚Äúwater‚Äù and theory. <br><br>  A good example - <a href="http://texterra.ru/blog/kak-sozdat-sayt-na-wordpress-polnoe-rukovodstvo-dlya-novichkov.html">How to create a website on WordPress: a complete guide for beginners</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63b/444/85c/63b44485c3bb499e87acebb9b3ac8d3c.png"><br><br>  Something like this should look like a guide in the style of "How to do ...".  By the way, such manuals can be done in video format.  Here is an example - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dk53P7ltLsZs">How to create an A / B test on a site using the service Changeagain.me</a> <br><br>  <i>Article article - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/mistakes/eti-17-oshibok-poxoronyat-vash-ab-test/">These [17 bugs] "bury" your A / B test</a></i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Free e-books</b> </h4><br><br>  Free e-books are one of the best ways to lead generation.  For example, on the website <a href="http://boosta.ru/">Boosta.ru</a> I offer a free e-book ‚ÄúA / B testing: from theory to practice‚Äù in exchange for a postal address.  And site visitors leave their mail.  Because they see this as value for themselves.  And I give what they need.  As a rule, in such books information is structured and consistent.  This is very convenient, as a quality e-book eliminates the subsequent searches for additional information in Google. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57a/69e/1dd/57a69e1dd3634a43907c56e1ae58ff3f.png"><br><br>  But the most important thing is that such books are very easy to make.  You do not need to write everything from scratch.  If you constantly run a blog of your company and write on a particular topic, then you already have a huge amount of necessary information.  The only thing that remains to be done is to put the whole thing together, organize it and convert it into a PDF format. <br><br>  This can be done directly in the Word, collecting all the information first, and then save it as a PDF.  Or, you can make a separate post, into which you can copy information from several articles at once, and then use the plug-in for Chrome Print Friendly &amp; PDF to transfer the post to a PDF in one click. <br><br>  The cost of creating this type of content is minimal.  Most often, this is just your time.  And the result is very good. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/startap-plotguru-podnyal-konversiyu-lendinga-s-9-do-52-a-vam-slabo/">Startup Plotguru raised the landing page conversion from 9% to 52%.</a></i>  <i><a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/startap-plotguru-podnyal-konversiyu-lendinga-s-9-do-52-a-vam-slabo/">Are you weak?</a></i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Webinars</b> </h4><br><br>  Webinars do not quite relate to the types of content, but nevertheless this is another way of conveying information / communication with the target audience.  And a very effective way. <br><br>  If you are well-versed in your field, you have a lot of ready-made content and presentations, then you can easily hold webinars once a week / month, communicate with the target audience, train and increase its loyalty (at the same time your image as an expert). <br><br>  Webinars allow you to diversify ordinary text articles very well and attract an additional audience, especially if you can share them well. <br><br>  Many Western companies every week conduct webinars on their topics.  Thanks to this, they generate leads and increase their expertise.  Moreover, systematic work is very important here.  If you want to start conducting webinars, then you need to make a plan in advance, select the frequency and follow the chosen strategy.  At the first webinar there may be very few people.  But over time, with a consistent strategy, the number of listeners will definitely increase (of course, if you tell great information). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e4/f09/7b2/5e4f097b2fb147c29e961547dec23053.png"><br><br>  A good example of using this type of content can be found at <a href="http://webpromoexperts.com.ua/">WebPromoExperts</a> Academy of Internet Marketing.  Every month, about 10 webinars on various topics on internet marketing.  On average, each webinar is attended by over 100 people.  By the way, I once spoke there and talked about A / B testing - 140 interested listeners gathered.  You can watch the recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D6p-Vbo9sUU4">here.</a> <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/advice/otvety-na-20-samyx-rasprostranennyx-voprosov-po-ab-testirovaniyu/">Answers to the 20 most common questions on A / B testing</a></i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Podcasts</b> </h4><br><br>  A completely unattended type of content in the Russian-speaking environment.  In general, a podcast is an audio recording.  In fact, you can simply translate any text into a podcast by reading it onto a microphone.  And it will be a new kind of content that your readers can listen to while walking along the street or on the way to work.  For some, this option is more convenient than reading articles on the site. <br><br>  If you want to make something more unique and interesting, then the podcast can be in the format of an interview, as does Taisiya Kudashkina from <a href="http://websarafan.ru/">Websarafan</a> .  By the way, she is very successful in this regard.  In each podcast, Taisiya talks to successful people about how they promote their business and how they live and work.  Very interesting format, which, judging by the reviews, like the audience.  You can listen to these podcasts directly on the site or subscribe to iTunes and receive alerts on new episodes. <br><br>  I think that the success factors for this type of content on the WebSarafan are their quality and consistency (the base of podcasts is constantly updated). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/934/40f/3ee/93440f3ee7954f64834bfdef82dc3ae6.png"><br><br>  Does this not allow to diversify your content marketing? <br><br>  In my opinion, this is a very interesting option.  Personally, I still can not get to him, although my hands itch ... <br><br>  By the way, here is a <a href="http://websarafan.ru/category/podkasty/">link to the podcast database</a> with Websarafan.  I think it will be useful and interesting for you to listen. <br><br><h4>  <b>Reviews of the best articles in their industry</b> </h4><br><br>  Recently, on Buste, I launched a new section - an overview of the best Runet articles on Internet marketing (the first review can be viewed at <a href="http://boosta.ru/best-articles/luchshie-stati-po-internet-marketingu-19-oktyabrya-1-noyabrya/">this link</a> ). <br><br>  It would seem that I just give my traffic to other sites that write good articles about the same subject as me.  Many would not do so because of some personal prejudice (it‚Äôs a pity to give traffic to competitors, allegedly) <br><br>  When I ran this rubric in my head there was one goal - to give more value to my readers.  Judging by the likes and reposts on Facebook, the number of views and clicks on the e-mail newsletter, they like it.  And I will continue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6a/85a/74e/a6a85a74e55e44c68585e614e5e9930d.jpeg"><br><br>  If you constantly monitor what is happening in your market and know where there is quality content, then why not share it with site visitors?  This type of content carries real value and reduces the time for searching and consuming information worthwhile.  The target audience will thank you for it. <br><br>  By the way, ideally, this process can be optimized to such an extent that the authors of cool articles themselves will send all the necessary information, and you will only need to choose among it.  But for this, of course, you need to have a large number of site visitors (so that the authors have an incentive to get into your reviews). <br><br><h4>  <b>Reviews of the best online and offline events on your topic</b> </h4><br><br>  Nowadays, webinars and industry events are incredibly popular.  Every month dozens and hundreds of similar events are held in each area.  People love to visit them. After all, you can upgrade your skills, learn ‚Äúinsights‚Äù, get to know your colleagues and just have a good time. <br><br>  But the search for these events sometimes takes a long time.  Where to find them?  Who holds good events?  Which speakers give cool information?  I think that you, as an expert in your field, know all this. <br><br>  So why don't you use this information as another kind of content?  For example, monthly digests of the best online events or quarterly reviews of upcoming offline conferences on your topics? <br><br>  This is a great infoprovod.  Moreover, such content is well diverged in social networks.  Similar posts gain a large number of likes and reposts, as well as reviews of the best articles. <br><br>  Of course, here you will also provide links to these events and in fact ‚Äúgive‚Äù traffic to other companies, event organizers.  But initially, a person will come to your site.  And it is on your site that he will find out about it.  And he will be grateful to you for this review. <br><br>  By the way, while no one has canceled the various ways of collecting e-mail addresses of all who come to your site to watch this review and go to the external page.  With proper use of pop-ups and subscription forms, you can convert from 2 to 10% of visitors to subscribers before they follow an external link. <br><br>  On Buste, I already launched this kind of content.  In the E-mail newsletter 3 months ago.  But this month I made a separate article on the site.  Readers are happy.  Here is one of the evidence from a follower on Twitter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a9/264/3bc/4a92643bcebf4edcb07e9d6de44439e9.png"><br><br><h4>  <b>Service / Project Reviews</b> </h4><br><br>  This is one of the most viral content types. <br><br>  Before I start talking about him, I have a question for you.  Have you seen the post "300 free services for business"? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fde/259/e98/fde259e989114c0c94b79b0d9506d955.png"><br><br>  Everyone saw.  100% sure.  This post was in every group on social networks.  This post has been published on many sites.  Here are the results of the publication of this post on Habr√©: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4c/a0e/6ea/c4ca0e6ea8ff499a8f82f52ba299e319.png"><br><br>  888,000 views.  Try to find at least one more article on the website or another site with so many views.  It is a pity that on Habr√© you can not see how many reposts in social networks have this article.  I am sure that there are several tens of thousands of shareings in Vk.  I personally subscribed to many groups and everywhere saw this post. <br><br>  What is it for me? <br><br>  Lists of services on your topic - this is a very powerful type of content.  They are loved by the vast majority of Internet users (although I‚Äôm very skeptical of them if these are such empty reviews with names and one sentence in the description, but these are already my pens) <br><br>  In any case, such reviews are useful if you give your target audience the information already collected about cool tools.  It saves them time.  This allows you to get acquainted with all the necessary tools for business.  This is a value, definitely. <br><br>  In addition, such articles always have numbers in the title.  In our case, this is "300 free services."  Headings with numbers tend to attract attention better.  Accordingly, the clickability is higher. <br><br>  Articles in the form of lists, reviews of services, as a rule, have more reposts.  These articles are very simple and understandable to all.  And everyone wants to share them with friends to give them a favor (One of the most important factors when sharing content is the desire to help friends / colleagues). <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/various/kak-uvelichit-kolichestvo-repostov-kontenta/">How to increase the number of content reposts</a></i> <br><br>  Well, have you already decided what new kind of content you will try first on your site?  <b>I hope you will practice with new types of materials.</b> <br><br>  And in a week I will publish the second part of this article.  In it, you will learn about the content that users themselves generate, about life-style posts, cases, interviews, infographics, and some more equally interesting options. <br><br>  Prepared by the blog <a href="http://boosta.ru/">Boosta.ru</a> and the project <a href="http://www.changeagain.me/ru/">Changeagain.me</a> <br><br>  Read also our other popular articles: <br><br>  1. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19126/">They will help you find all the ‚Äúkillers‚Äù of the conversion - 10 reports in Google Analytics</a> (5000+ views) <br>  2. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19542/">100 ideas for A / B testing.</a>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19542/">Part One</a> (2000+ views) <br>  3. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19548/">100 ideas for A / B testing: Part Two</a> (1000+ views) <br>  4. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19686/">How to find an idea for an A / B test: heat maps and polls</a> (1000+ views) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296250/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296250/</a></p>
