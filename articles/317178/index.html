  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why not write bots for Skype</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago, I promised Skype / Microsoft support specialists to publish this article.  And the promises, as is known, must be fulfilled. <br><br>  Six months ago, I wrote a bot for Skype (in itself, creating a bot was not without difficulties due to incomplete Microsoft documentation, see <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/281296/">my article</a> on this). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I‚Äôm not even going to say that the bot stopped working for unknown reasons, and resumed work only after writing to Microsoft. <br><br>  Let's talk about the publication of the bot, incl.  his publication in the directory. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In the previous article I wrote: <br><blockquote>  How long the publishing process takes is not clear; this is not documented.  My bot has not yet been published.  On the official forum, my question on this topic is bypassed (although Microsoft employees answer my other questions). </blockquote><br>  I requested the publication of the bot in mid-April.  The answer (refusal to publish) was received on April 22 (follow the dates).  He read the following: <br><blockquote>  1. Line up and in English. <br>  2. It‚Äôs not easy to follow.  Please fix this. <br>  3. No appropriate welcome greeting <br>  Skype Guideline: 1 <br>  4. </blockquote><br>  I will not translate everything completely and give my answer entirely.  In short, I was asked to translate the English phrase, which was intended only for Russian users (said ‚Äúsend me &lt;hello&gt; if you want to speak Russian‚Äù), asked to write <a href="http://tstatsbot.appspot.com/skypebot/privacy">Privacy</a> and <a href="http://tstatsbot.appspot.com/skypebot/tos">TOS</a> (for the bot!), Referred to the guidelines which does not exist, and was asked to check the command, the support of which was not stated anywhere in the bot. <br><br>  On April 28, it was confirmed that the bot was published. <br><br>  On May 12, I realized that the publication of a bot requested through a private office is not a publication of a bot in the Directory, it is a change in the status of a bot so that more than 100 people can use it.  Requested the publication of the bot in the Directory (letter).  The answer was received only on June 20 (after several reminders on my part): <br><blockquote>  You will not be published in the bot directory at this time.  However, it is a join link that you can use. <br></blockquote><br>  In response, they write that they decided not to publish my bot.  Without specifying the reason.  June 21, I asked for a reason.  In response - silence.  After the reminder, the answer came July 26: <br><blockquote>  It comes to the bot directory.  We cannot release the criteria.  We would like to agree on a link. <br><br>  For further consideration. </blockquote><br>  Those.  ‚ÄúWe decided not to publish the bot in the Directory, but we cannot tell why.  Keep working on the bot and maybe we will publish it. ‚Äù  Is ingenious?  It seems to me that yes.  Bot developers are encouraged to guess the desires of Microsoft. <br><br>  <b>Do you still want to develop bots for Skype?</b>  If so, read on. <br><br>  In November, my bot began to unexpectedly receive new messages about the format of which he did not know.  When I entered my <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/bots/manage">account</a> on November 29 (the link to it already redirects to the new office), I found out that Microsoft had released a new version of the API for bots - version 3 (the previous one was the first, where the second was, unknown), and since November 30 they will stop supporting bots running through the old personal account.  That is, firstly, they broke the API of the first version.  Secondly, they launched a new version of the API (without sending a single letter about it).  And thirdly, they simply turned off the old bots, notifying about this only by a message in the personal account (the link Read More, by the way, led to an incorrect document in this notification).  "Old" bots now need to register again - they now have a new id, forgive old users! <br><br>  Do you need such surprises from Microsoft? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317178/</a></p>
