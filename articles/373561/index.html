  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview AirWheel Z5 - transport metropolis</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The electric scooter easily undermines from the place of the owner under 100 kg of weight, confidently accelerates to 20 km / h and allows you to quickly get from the subway to work.  This magnet looks around, after which you do not need to run into the shower and pay a thousand kilowatts of electricity.  Today we will talk about how the AirWheel Z5 electric scooter fits into the everyday life of a megalopolis rescue, helps save time and quench the thirst of a new toy, which is doubly important for those who are spoiled by advanced gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/eeb/003/6a5/eeb0036a53a048818cf8edf450b51f86.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having once again got into a deaf traffic jam, we look with envy at the cyclists passing by and give ourselves the promise to join the eco-friendly two-wheeled transport tomorrow. <br><br>  But most motorists will not reach the store and will not buy a bicycle, making a list of reasons to justify.  He has nowhere to put, he needs protection, somehow he needs to move around and park somewhere at work.  In addition, pedaling in a shirt and trousers is not so easy, and by the end of the working day, paranoia about stealing a bicycle from the parking will imperceptibly turn into an unobtrusive psychosis.

      The scooter is much better suited to the title of universal urban transport, especially when it is on electric.  Our AirWheel Z5 is exactly the same, with carefully thought-out ergonomics and a classic rear-wheel drive.  Compact, maneuverable, with a cruising range of 20 km and extremely easy to learn by a beginner. <br><br><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><br>  AirWheel Z5 is completely ready to use "right out of the box" and does not require any tools for assembly.  It is enough to bring it into position and connect a complete battery, after which you can go.  The scooter also comes with a proprietary charger with grounding and a brief instruction manual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/456/a3e/0e3/456a3e0e3f3947a58b979c5af4153a9a.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><br>  Externally, it is quite difficult to distinguish the AirWheel Z5 from a simple scooter.  Classic 8 inch wheels with a standardized nipple for pumping, side wings, aluminum frame and telescopic steering rack - with the latter and begin a visual inspection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/74d/b91/81e/74db9181e4e64f0d9923a65be28e9c25.jpg"><br><br>  On the edges of the steering wheel, ergonomically shaped handles are installed, made of modern elastic materials, guaranteeing a reliable grip during active driving.  No odors and hard notches that interfere with comfortable use.  A standard mechanical bell is installed near the left handle, as well as a cable-operated rear-drum brake mechanism, like on a regular bicycle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d7e/974/323/d7e9743235d6417c84b30f43737a9333.jpg"><br><br>  On the right is the control unit with a gas lever and a charge test button, with three LED sections.  All three LEDs talk about a full charge, two LEDs mean a level, and one red hints at the last 5 kilometers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b64/ca1/7d6/b64ca17d656e9fd7d0b4da86240c4ded.jpg"><br><br>  Closer to the center of the steering wheel are two spring clamps, pulling which, you can quickly fold it along the rack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6e8/f89/68f/6e8f8968fb264523870395714aa317e9.jpg"><br><br>  To fold the wheel of the scooter along the body, it is necessary to extend the wide conical base all the way up, lower the stand and fix it with a special groove, similar to a hanger.  Note the LED flashlight with USB-powered, mounted on the front plug. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6ec/979/80e/6ec97980e7a3444e997b06397802b609.jpg"><br><br>  The massive frame of the AirWheel Z5 is literally ‚Äúwrapped up‚Äù with components of an electric motor, therefore two folding steps are arranged for the legs.  Under the left is a tiny stand for parking a scooter on a flat surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1b0/559/53d/1b055953dea8411ab03200eba707b211.jpg"><br><br>  The rear wheel is almost entirely covered with a protective cover that protects the motor from mechanical damage, and the owner - from splashes flying from the tire.  There is also a LED brake light at the back, which lights up when braking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4a1/2c3/227/4a12c32271164ccc80111c87622c8708.jpg"><br><br>  The massive block in the front of the frame contains all the control electronics and a removable battery.  Having pulled back the lock located on the left sidewall, you can easily replace the battery, or take it home, leaving a scooter, for example, in the trunk of a car. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff4/c77/b7c/ff4c77b7ce54bd4531bd0f62661c3217.jpg"><br><br>  Despite its impressive size, the lithium-ion battery weighs only 1.33 kg.  On the front side there is a power button, a connector for a proprietary network charger and a USB output with a current of 2.1A, to which you can connect a flashlight, or charge any gadget. <br><br><h2>  Technical part </h2><br>  The AirWheel Z5 scooter becomes technologically advanced due to a 350 W motor installed on the rear wheel, using a No. 45 neodymium magnet - thanks to its efficiency we get fast acceleration to 20 km / h and confident traction.  The drum brake mechanism is integrated into the wheel disk, the pads are pressed by the cable drive from the handle on the steering wheel.  The rear tire is solid - for a softer ride. <br><br>  On the front wheel of the scooter is an inflatable tire - with a camera and a standard automotive nipple for pumping.  Oil shock absorbers with springs are installed on the plug, which reduce the impact on the steering wheel when driving over bumps. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Specifications Airwheel Z5</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Max.  speed <br></td><td>  20 km / h <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Stroke range <br></td><td>  18-22 km <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Motor power <br></td><td>  350 W <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight <br></td><td>  13 kg <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Battery <br></td><td>  removable lithium-ion, 162.8 W / h <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Temperature conditions <br></td><td>  From -5 to + 35 ¬∞  <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum load <br></td><td>  100 kg <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Cost of <br></td><td>  31 990 r <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>  Mobile app </h2><br>  Like any tech gadget, the AirWheel Z5 electric scooter is equipped with an on-board computer with the ability to synchronize data with a smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0.  The brief instructions clearly describe the process of connecting to a smartphone on iOS or Android, and here we emphasize the ability to set a limit to the maximum speed and view data on the current mileage and speed.  In addition, the application displays the battery charge level in percent, and the speed is measured up to a tenth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b87/d09/23f/b87d0923ff87d9a45d25506a680cf7f9.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Go! </h2><br>  Getting off the air on the AirWheel Z5 is as easy as a regular scooter.  Fold back steps, rests one foot and repelled the second. <br><br>  In principle, on a scooter you can safely move around the city without a battery, but it is much more interesting to push the gas and rush forward.  Traction motor is easily enough to undermine up to 10 km / h in just a couple of seconds, another instant - and now you are confidently moving at a speed of 18-20 km / h, maneuvering the steering wheel and body.  Feelings from the silent electric traction can not be compared with anything, and even if you are a large man weighing under 100 kg, the AirWheel Z5 accelerates you as fast as a 13 year old teenager. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8eb/28c/e10/8eb28ce1058e0814550c4932a8f44cf9.jpg"><br><br>  Maneuverability and ease of landing at altitude, but what about the suspension and brakes?  Driving along smooth park pavement does not cause discomfort, but with holes and irregularities it is worth being careful, slowing down to 5 km / h and avoiding obstacles above 3 cm. The significant advantage of a scooter over monowheels and gyroscooters is that any curb is easy to overcome by lifting technique behind the wheel for a couple of seconds.  The rear disc brake with a wire-operated drive is average in efficiency, forgives inexperienced owners to sudden braking at speed, and the braking distance from 20 km / h is about 12 meters - depending on the weight of the driver.  But you can always slow down with your foot and not worry about falls, like on a bicycle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e4f/772/2e3/e4f7722e38d74e148cfecee419a46bf6.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Through city traffic </h2><br>  Ride on Sunday on the AirWheel Z5 and feel the fresh breeze cool, but are you also interested in the convenience of everyday use?  Despite the similarity in size with an ordinary scooter, ours is much faster and more maneuverable, and therefore we will compare it with a bicycle.  Thus, the bike that does not fit into the passenger elevator and requires a separate ticket in the train, and in the subway can only be with the front wheel unscrewed and in the case.  Add to this the physical burden of pedaling, sweaty clothes from the heat and big questions about parking in the office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/af6/323/16f/af632316fb4847b08851f18a6b4821f9.jpg"><br><br>  The scooter is much more practical in terms of storage and carrying, so the AirWheel Z5 can be easily brought into the subway car and any public transport, taken to the office and put the locker room in the corner, or parked in the cafe at the table.  Surrounding loyal to him, but you should get up on the Z5 and succumb to the gas - surprised by the looks of others guaranteed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/140/8ec/1da/1408ec1da615408cbe7a8ce0ccb08c23.jpg"><br><br>  Separately, I want to emphasize the convenience of mixed movement: by car, public transport and AirWheel Z5.  In this situation, you can safely park the car at the intercepting parking lot, with a breeze to get to the nearest metro station, and then just as quickly get from another station to the desired place. <br><br>  We can say that the speed of movement in the megalopolis of AirWheel Z is not inferior to a city bike, but it is more maneuverable and does not require much physical activity, allowing you to save strength for important things. <br><br><h2>  Nutrition </h2><br>  We told almost everything about the AirWheel Z5, but never mentioned the battery.  It uses a quick-release battery with lithium-ion batteries from the DP with a total capacity of 4500 mAh (162.8 W / h).  Full battery charging from the proprietary charger lasts only a little more than two hours.  When traveling with a maximum speed, this is enough just for the stated 20 km of the way.  On average, it is worth counting on 1-1.5 hours of the engine when the gas trigger is pressed, and with what speed you will move - you decide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c6a/381/c74/c6a381c747654292a15ece087995cebe.jpg"><br><br>  Conveniently, without pressing the gas, energy is practically not consumed, but on the AirWheel Z5 you can move around like a regular scooter, leaving 10-15% of the charge for lifting up the hill. <br><br><h2>  Eventually </h2><br>  The scooter with the electric motor AirWheel Z5 is a maneuverable and technological vehicle that will fit well into the life of a modern metropolis resident.  It is smaller and more comfortable than a bicycle, more comfortable when moving than a regular scooter, more versatile than a hydroscooter or a monowheel, and allows you to build flexible routes as opposed to moving on a car.  Yes, the amount needed to buy it is hardly always in the pocket of an ordinary person - but this ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù, it seems to us, will pay off more than by saving time, effort and money on the road. <br><br>  <i><b>Benefits:</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>- a folding platform for legs;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Adjustable steering wheel height;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- quick release battery;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- effective lighting and brake light.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b>Disadvantages:</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>- on-board computer through the application;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- many protruding metal elements.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0b0/6d6/a9f/0b06d6a9f5494acfbedfe3c1308872d5.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373561/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373561/</a></p>
