Maybe it will be interesting to someone. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  One of the clients has become downright unlucky for hosters.  Their site, which has been reworked many times over the last year, is located on a private collocation and works quite normally.  But something went wrong in the arrangements and they wanted to change the host.  They signed an agreement with Masterhost (it was last spring) and asked to transfer the site.  It seems to be a trifling matter, but something was clearly wrong.  And ftp and ssh to the specified server somehow very strangely slowed down.  Okay, I think, I am far from Moscow, maybe some of the channels in the route are full (the traceroute didn‚Äôt give anything suspicious - all along the route there was a delay of 100 ms). <br><br>  Laid out the site, tested.  It seems to be okay, the page loads in 25-40 seconds (my megabit channel is free, but I am in another country).  Check, I say, everything seems to be working.  Clients are at a loss - the page loads 4 minutes.  And the old hosting works like a clock.  The only answer is technical support - everything works fine for us.  Through my friends I check the speed of access to the site from various Moscow providers.  The result is the same - incredible brakes.  There was no clear answer from Masterhost and their hosting was refused.

      A week ago, the client decided to change hosting again.  This time, RBC services were purchased (not the cheapest tariff plan, despite the fact that the site is quite simple).  After reading for their control panel, he figured out somehow how to work with her and threw the site there.  Now the page load has become unstable with me.  Less than a minute, it did not load at all.  Many pictures were never updated.  The very first tests showed that static files are loaded with a delay of 2 to 30 seconds (they have ngnix), despite the fact that php works in 0.3 seconds. <br><br>  For the experiment, I generate a static page (I specifically took a page with a large number of images) and make a detailed printout of the browser request timings.  I am writing a letter to RBC technical support with a log file and links to the test page.  No answer.  On the phone they talk about the fact that my problem is dealt with (standard excuse?) And nothing changes.  A week has passed.  Neither answer nor decision.  The client remained on the old hosting. <br><br>  PS for the sample I threw this test page on the American shared-hosting in Chicago, where I place small clients.  The page loads at full speed of my channel without delays and brakes.  For interest, I threw the whole site there.  Scripts work with lightning speed, everything works as it should.  At the same time, I know that that American server serves at least several hundred domains, including a lot of heavy and loaded ones. <br><br>  PPS can someone know how to get a normal result from RBC before they were denied their services? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24682/</a></p>
