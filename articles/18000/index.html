The interview was completed around midnight on December 24 and edited 40 minutes before publication in the early morning of December 25.  Fresh just does not happen. <br>  2. Interview big. <br>  3. The interview was prepared in conjunction with the resource MoneyNews (http://www.moneynews.ru/article.asp?view=14728), but it is here that placed without cuts in its original form. <br>  So‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <b>What is the current share of WebMoney in the domestic market of electronic payments?</b>  <b>What is the dynamics of this indicator in WebMoney in 2006-2007, as well as in comparison with other payment systems?</b> <br>  I think that regarding the market share it is not very correct to ask to assess their own position of the leaders of this market themselves.  But according to independent estimates, WebMoney Transfer owns at least 70% of the EPS market in Russia.  (see expert opinions: press secretary of Finam IC Vladislav Kochetkov <a href="http://www.telnews.ru/theme/14919/">www.telnews.ru/theme/14919</a> and Andrei Shipilov <a href="http://www.telnews.ru/theme/15004/">www.telnews.ru/theme/15004</a> ). <br>  In general, our turnover in 2006 compared with 2005, doubled in operations with WMZ (1.4 billion dollars equivalent), three times in operations with WMR.  Now it can be argued that in the outgoing 2007, our system showed the same dynamics of growth in turnover and the number of transactions.  And, naturally, we did not reduce, but increased our presence in the Russian and Western market and really work as an international system of Internet payments. <br>  At the very beginning of 2008, we plan to publish a statistical annual report. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>A landmark event for WebMoney is 4 million registrations, which the system reported at the end of August this year.</b>  <b>Until now, none of the domestic EPS even close with WebMoney for this indicator.</b>  <b>The natural question is when can we expect an anniversary 5-millionth registration?</b>  <b>And how do you generally assess the prospects of such an impressive quantitative growth rate?</b>

      4 million registrations - an event for the entire domestic EPS market.  The point is not simply that someone is far or not so far from WebMoney Transfer, the fact is that this is an indicator of the activity of Russian users, dynamic development, and the ever-growing interest in online payments not only abroad, which is customary, but also we have.  Therefore, we have not just confirmed our position, I think that this figure said a lot about the market in general.  But even in the middle of the year, many journalists liked to talk about the immaturity of the online payment market, its underdevelopment, the lack of demand for the service ... All these speculations are refuted by the facts.  Now we keep the average registration rate from 4,500 to 5,000 per day.  At this rate, we will reach 5 million in almost six months. <br>  So far, we see no restrictions for the same growth prospects.  According to various estimates, in RuNet in one way or another paid from 13% to 17% of users, while in Europe and the United States this figure reaches 60% and more.  Secondly, there are many developing countries on the world map, where the absolute and relative growth rates of Internet users are even higher than in Russia, and the penetration of electronic payments is still lower. <br><br>  <b>Quantitative indicators are largely due to the constant qualitative growth and expansion of WebMoney.</b>  <b>This year was no exception, the system offered users a number of fundamentally new services.</b>  <b>What seems to be the most noticeable to you?</b> <br><br>  Do you know what is the key to our leadership?  For almost all of our services, the foundation was laid back when designing the system ten years ago.  This is called the strategy of success. <br>  In 2007, we launched three main products to the market. <br>  Of course, the new digital currency - WebMoney Gold.  Fully secured with gold and the first and only such in the Russian market.  This, without any shadow of irony, is a unique tool.  Although I will refrain now from answering your legitimate question about WMG operations statistics.  We have never made predictions based on less than six months of a product or service and now we will not.  The currency is young, promising and defiant business interest. <br>  We presented a wide user processing.webmoney.ru - service for sellers.  It is these users of electronic cash that provide it with liquidity and popularity.  And they need the most diverse ways to work with us.  Processing offers all merchants to transfer to WebMoney Transfer such functions as <br>  ‚Ä¢ Acceptance of payments from our customers <br>  ‚Ä¢ Bank transfer to current account <br>  ‚Ä¢ Provision of registers for the billing period. <br>  All this significantly reduces the load on the Seller.  Technical and organizational issues are covered by our Guarantee Agency.  I think that in the upcoming 2008 development and improvement of the WebMoney processing service will be given special attention. <br>  Significant changes have affected our version of WebMoney Keeper for mobile devices.  We can safely say that now we have a full line of interfaces: Keeper Classic for desktops, Keeper Light - browser version and Keeper Mobile 2.0 for owners of phones, smartphones and PDAs that support java and the Internet.  Now you can manage your finances anywhere and at any time - synchronization with wallets, transfer of funds to correspondents in the contact list and in general, payment of any incoming bills, and so on - I do not think that it is appropriate to talk about specific merits and differences.  You can find out everything and download the application to your phone on the website of the service - <a href="http://www.telepat.ru/">www.telepat.ru</a> <br>  I would like to draw attention to the less obvious for the beginner, but very important achievements for all our users.  Among the more than 4 million in our system there are at least 1.5 million of the most active, demanding, most, as they say, ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù clients.  In 2007 alone, we were able to release 5 new versions of our main interface, Keeper Classic, and take into account most of their suggestions and wishes.  Support for "hot keys", redemption of WM-cards directly from Keeper, time-protected transfers, refund and much more ... - I am sure that this work brings both a huge part of commercial success and users' gratitude. <br><br>  <b>This year, WebMoney has significantly expanded the list of counterparties, through which users received even more opportunities for both input and WM output.</b>  <b>Curiously, how many white spots remain on the world map today, where it is impossible to enter or withdraw WebMoney?</b> <br><br>  Existing methods of depositing and withdrawing funds were actively developed: prepaid cards, terminal networks, exchange offices, transfer systems without opening a CONTACT and UNIStream account, transfer to a bank account, and so on. <br>  But the geography of WebMoney itself has expanded.  Our Ukrainian partners say that a real breakthrough happened in the past year in operations with WMU.  Over the year, many Ukrainian trading companies were connected to the WebMoney system, several direct deposit gateways were launched, more than one interesting project was announced, contracts were signed with a number of banks, and the number of U-purses replenishment points increased 8 times!  It can be predicted that all indicators of Ukrainian WM-units in the outgoing year increased by 3-4 times. <br>  In the other hemisphere of ‚ÄúWebMoney-Globe‚Äù - in the UAE, 30 other countries of the Middle East and Africa - users had the opportunity to replenish wm-wallets using the Top-Up <a href="http://top-up.wmtransfer.com/">service top-up.wmtransfer.com</a> and <a href="http://top-up.wmtransfer.com/">prepaid</a> cards of the largest operator in the region cashU. <br>  And we will still actively increase our presence in other countries, not only in Russia and the CIS - as you know, the Internet is limitless. <br><br>  <b>As is known, from June 1, 2008, all airlines in the world are obliged to switch to electronic tickets.</b>  <b>For payment systems in this regard, offers very attractive opportunities.</b>  <b>How can you evaluate the prospects of using WebMoney in relation to the payment of electronic tickets?</b> <br><br>  We go there in cooperation with large processing companies and payment integrators.  If we allow ourselves to assess the situation from our point of view, then I see that in the situation with electronic tickets for our carriers and agents, several other aspects are important so far - accounting, legislation, and document flow.  Roughly speaking - they know what an e-ticket will be, they know the deadlines for which it should be put into circulation and they know what exactly they need to do in order to work smoothly and clearly.  The choice of EPS here is one step in a row of several equally important.  But, on the other hand, the sphere of mutually beneficial interests of agents and WebMoney Transfer itself is much broader than the issue of electronic tickets - and in 2008 we will continue to work in this market. <br><br>  <b>The current system of Internet payments, talking about their advantages, very often called such a moment as the irrevocability of payments.</b>  <b>However, the flip side of this advantage is the ever-increasing activity of all kinds of scammers.</b>  <b>Can it still happen that WebMoney will have such a thing as ‚Äúrepayment of payments‚Äù?</b> <br><br>  The new version of Keeper Classic (http://webmoney.ru/rus/about/demo/index.shtml) directly in the menu has such a function as ‚Äúreturn the payment‚Äù and the opportunity to return the incomplete incoming payment with the protection of the transaction to the sender.  I'm sure that is enough.  We will never have a chargeback in the banking sense of the word, since this enters into a fundamental contradiction with the nature of digital goods and services, a copy of which can be obtained free of charge and instantly, and the original ‚Äúreturned‚Äù to the seller.  And regarding protection against fraudsters, we can confidently assert - if you follow all our recommendations and recommendations of antivirus software vendors - the risk of losing your funds is vanishingly small and depends only on yourself. <br>  For our part, we provide all effective ways to get information about the counterparty and provide it about yourself, if you trust your customers dearly: <br>  1) certificate level (type of certificate, starting with Personal, shows that the System at least checked the passport data of a particular wmid user that was presented to us), 2) BL - business level (the indicator is added according to a certain formula from the time the user works in the system, the number of his transactions, turnover, reviews and complaints, if any) 3) Arbitration - the body for the pretrial resolution of controversial issues. <br>  When making a transaction, you always need to collect the maximum possible amount of reliable information about your partner - we give all users this opportunity, but we cannot be responsible for your final decision. <br>  <b>The controversy surrounding the recent legal conflict with instant payment machines has not ceased, when banks have clearly made it clear to the terminal customers that they are interested in their piece of cake.</b>  <b>What is your attitude to this situation?</b>  <b>Perhaps the time is not far distant when the Internet payment systems will also experience this kind of pressure ...</b> <br>  Fortunately, we are not one of the parties to this ‚Äúsoap opera‚Äù, which has been going on for a year now and will probably continue after the elections.  The only thing I would like is that the principle of ‚Äúforest chopping is not fulfilled - the chips fly‚Äù and the users who now have a cheap and easy way to replenish not only e-wallets, but also many other Internet services are not extreme. <br>  No one spoke more succinctly than Andrei Shipilov: ‚ÄúThe regulatory framework for electronic payment systems has existed for more than ten years and works perfectly in the current environment.‚Äù (Http://www.telnews.ru/theme/15004/) <br><br>  <b>In conclusion, I would like to touch on a joyful event for your company.</b>  <b>Recently, the WebMoney Transfer system has become the winner of the National Banking Award in the nomination ‚ÄúThe Best Online Payment System‚Äù.</b>  <b>Your own rating ...</b> <br><br>  We became the winner of the National Banking Award according to the results of the popular vote.  The users themselves decided the fate of the nominees.  The list of companies among which the voters were choosing can be seen on the Award website.  Frankly, we are very pleased to receive an award from such a conservative community like banking, and it is even more pleasant that users took the time to express their support in this way. <br>  But it seems to me that our other achievements over this and past years gave us every reason to believe that the choice of people would be just that.  In 2008, WebMoney Transfer will celebrate a significant anniversary, very ‚Äúsolid‚Äù for the EPS sector - 10 years from the moment of the first transaction.  But if in terms of security, we are just as ‚Äúsolid‚Äù, strict, closed and ‚Äúbuttoned up to all buttons‚Äù, then in terms of development, presentation of new products and services, we will try to please our current and future users with activity and new opportunities. <br><br><br>  I congratulate everyone who reads this interview in pre-New Year troubles, all our users, those who only think of becoming, with the upcoming holidays.  On the corporate greeting cards WebMoney Transfer says: "Money year to you!".  And I want to add: "And necessarily - joyful!" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18000/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18000/</a></p>
