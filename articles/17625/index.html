  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Website, car - no difference!
Simple answers to 7 popular questions about site building.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I work for a website development company.  Sometimes it is very difficult to explain what, why, and how much.  The easiest and fastest way to find a common language with a potential customer is to translate everything into simple and understandable for most analogies.  I usually use a car for this purpose. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So let's start the most popular question: <br><br>  1. How much does it cost to make a website? <br>  How much is a car?  Cars are different: cars, trucks, Russian, Japanese, specialized, retro, etc.  Call the cost, not knowing the answers to the questions: what brand, year of manufacture, model, etc.  You are interested - impossible. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      2. I was offered to make a website with the same functionality several times cheaper? <br>  You can buy a used nine and a new Volkswagen.  Both cars are on the move, they have a steering wheel, four wheels, an engine, a saloon, the same functionality - the difference is in the details and, of course, in price. <br><br>  3. If I pay a lot of money, I am guaranteed to get a good site? <br>  You live in Russia, therefore, the choice of a contractor, as well as a car dealership, should be treated very carefully. <br><br>  4. Why should I pay for hosting, if it is full of free (very cheap) alternatives? <br>  This is your choice.  You can put the car in a guarded "parking" and we can guarantee that everything will be fine with it.  At least you will have someone to ask.  There is always an option to put the car under the window, throw at the office or on the side of the road.  Save money, but there is a high probability that somehow there will be no car at all or you will find it without wheels, glass, etc. <br><br>  5. Will our secretary cope with the support and content of the site? <br>  And you trust her to replace the oil in your car, the operation is simple?  In most cases, site support is more than just ‚Äúpaste text from clipboard‚Äù.  Therefore, to ensure that the project is always ‚Äúon the go‚Äù, contact for support only in ‚Äúcertified centers‚Äù. <br><br>  6. I‚Äôll probably do without optimization, promotion, advertising ... <br>  Was it worth buying a car, knowing that for two years, you‚Äôll roll it out of the garage a couple of times to show your neighbor Uncle Van?  Whatever your site is worth nothing to him if people do not find it. <br><br>  7. If we make a website, how much money, customers, orders, etc.  will he bring?  How quickly will pay off? <br>  Everything depends only on its owner, the gazelle itself will not earn money.  Earnings are also in no way dependent on the seller in the cabin.  From one owner, the car will pay off in a year, from the other - it will rot without reaching a profitability rate.  We should not forget that there are only status (image) "cars".  It is useless to try to earn them by transporting "potatoes". <br><br>  If someone can continue, I will be grateful.  When reprinting do not forget to put an active link to the <a href="http://www.kulish.ru/websites/sitewihtauto/">original</a> article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17625/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17625/</a></p>
