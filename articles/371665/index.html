      Living creatures often have nicknames that reflect their essence.  To iCamPro ‚Äústuck‚Äù male name ‚ÄúKolobok‚Äù. <br>  From the smart and big-eyed Kolobka, neither grandparents nor Santa Claus, who made his way to the Christmas tree with a gift, nor even ... <br>  As in fairy tales, there are ‚Äúfoxes‚Äù in life.  Cloudy Gingerbread Man, where were you when ‚Äúmoles‚Äù turned into a ‚Äúpumpkin‚Äù recorder with local data storage? <br><br>  <b>Koloboks are back!</b>  <b>Welcome, or No Trespassing!</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It has become a tradition that the first letter ‚Äúi‚Äù in the title means that the next letter has a mind and intellect. <br>  Our clever Gingerbread Man appeared on New Year's Eve, and since then he has seen, listened to and knows a lot.  This sometimes helps in different situations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/232/f4d/c13/232f4dc13c424431acd5b754a61250e1.jpg"><br><br>  I have not noticed that modern young managers begin their activities with the introduction of an automated access system, control over vehicles, and ... installation of video cameras.  This increases the discipline of employees, labor productivity, work efficiency and, consequently, the company's revenue. <br><br>  Consider a specific case that can happen to anyone.  Or maybe it was already happening, but you didn‚Äôt notice it due to carelessness, lack of data or equipment. <br>  To unravel even the simplest case, you must quickly collect and process a huge amount of various information.  It takes a lot of patience and patience on the path to truth.  In order not to mix the interesting with the pleasant, the detective lovers go to the hiding <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bIMYdiGtGmjWYRnk4nNSYTfVix_Kcvb725hkC68PLdY/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">place</a> ‚ÄúInvestigations are conducted by Koloboks‚Äù.  With iCamPro everything would be easier and faster, but then we would lose an interesting and instructive investigation. <br><br>  <b>Now about the pleasant.</b> <br>  The Netherlands is not only a source of tulips, Dutch cheese, the inviting ‚Äúred light district‚Äù and other delights.  It is the birthplace of the revolutionary camera iCamPro, which appeared as a result of many modern achievements. <br>  It first thundered at CES-2015 (Las Vegas, USA), where it was recognized as the best innovation. <br>  Then there was the path to the consumer, and a milestone was <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1053849626/2015-ces-best-first-domestic-robot-that-tracks-int">Kickstarter</a> : ‚ÄúThe first home robot that tracks intruders!‚Äù <br>  So Kolobok's parents told about her, which scraped along the bottom of the barrel, were stranded in the barn. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4S5-6OeMNg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjEXegwVCcKOR1xtylG33Cte1oyUw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  1,627 people believed in the project, having invested $ 365,538. He received a start in life, and, behold, ... a drum roll ... on Kickstarter messages appear: <br>  07/10/2015 Dear supporters, we have good news, we officially began shipping the first iCamPro FHD on Monday. <br>  Already on July 28, the camera <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DxYxgYNje-kg">shot a</a> man running around the room with a baton in his hands. <br>  08.21.2015 Dear supporters, this week we sent 300 iCamPro FHD and expect to send more than 300 next week.  We hope we can improve the speed of the production line. <br><br>  On December 27, 2005, under our Christmas tree, an interesting gift appeared (however, you have already seen it). <br>  Today, the owner of an impressive new product <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/bezopasnost/icampro-white/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dicampro-white%26utm_content%3Dicampro-white%26utm_campaign%3Dicampro-white_133">can be</a> anyone. <br>  At the moment, brunettes and white blondes are baked. <br><br>  <b>Briefly about the main thing.</b> <br>  I do not know how all this fits in Kolobok‚Äôs head with a size of 10x10x9 cm and a mass of 250 grams, but only a brief enumeration for sure doesn‚Äôt seem to have all the possibilities! <br>  - simple, easy and quick setup in less than one minute; <br>  - automatic tracking of a moving object; <br>  - Circular coverage of the premises, which allows to drastically reduce the cost of equipment, cables, installation work and configuration; <br>  - sound sensor and three motion sensors; <br>  - custom control zones; <br>  - alerts in the form of text or photo messages with the transfer to the owner of the photo of the attacker's face in real time; <br>  - remote camera control; <br>  - the possibility of remote audio communication through the camera; <br>  - camera matrix - 1 / 2.7 "CMOS sensor with FHD resolution of 1920x1080 = 2 Mp, which allows to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dq_OPvaxkiFA">detect</a> moving intruders at a distance of up to 9 meters; <br>  - customizable image resolution formats: FHD, HD, VGA, QVGA; <br>  - recording speed of 30 frames per second to the maximum resolution of FHD; <br>  - two-channel audio file player; <br>  - MP3 player (‚Äúread‚Äù a fairy tale or book to a child at night); <br>  - siren or other audio files when an alarm is triggered; <br>  - record on the MicroSD card (Class 6 and higher) up to 32 GB; <br>  - TCP / IP, UDP / IP, HTTP / HTTPS, FTP, DHCP, NTP, WPS protocols; <br>  - recording information on a file server; <br>  - Google WebRTC technology (Real Time Communication); <br>  - video compression standard H.264, MJPEG; <br>  - 256-bit video encryption; <br>  - Dynamic adjustment of video resolution depending on the channel bandwidth; <br>  - free cloud storage up to 15 GB in Google Drive with archive viewing anywhere in the world; <br>  - free cloud-based 24-hour video storage and three days of alerts in Amaryllo Cloud with the possibility of extending the period to 30 and 365 days; <br>  - viewing images from the camera in real time in a special application or through a browser on Amaryllo Live; <br>  - the presence of a private mode of operation; <br>  - wireless data transmission method; <br>  - the use of MIMO technology when working in a Wi-Fi network 802.11 b / g / n to increase the bandwidth of the communication channel; <br>  - the ability to install both on the table and mounting on other surfaces, even on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dvk2beg_Pyak">ceiling</a> , with the rotation of the image; <br>  - color day and black and white night mode; <br>  - infrared illumination with a lack of light; <br>  - iOS operating systems support: 7.0 and higher, and also Android: 4.1 and higher. <br><br>  <b>And now let's try to take off with all this!</b> <br><br>  About the capabilities of the camera.  In the following description, versions of the application v1.2.15 under Android, and camera firmware v3.5.3 are considered, but! <br>  When the article was almost ready, I tried using an iPad.  Just at that moment there was an update of versions on v1.2.5.2050 and v3.6.2.  Changing the version number of the application occurred only after the third point.  What will happen in v2 ...? <br><br>  It is impossible to predict what will surprise Kolobok in the future, but you can influence it! <br>  Memorize your wishes in the course of reading the article, express them in the comments, and the staff of the Dajet will pass them directly to the developers of this miracle.  Then you can say that you took part in raising Kolobok. <br>  Can you think of different nicknames for him: ‚Äúcosmonaut‚Äù, ‚Äúhead with ears‚Äù, ‚Äúcountryman in the porthole‚Äù?  Write, he will not be offended. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b85/9ee/06c/b859ee06c127429f824cf32c08cd6026.jpg"><br><br>  Compared to the previous version, many new and useful features have appeared: <br>  - message about the detection of the face.  At the same time, ‚ÄúFace detection‚Äù can be disabled in the settings; <br>  - setting the home position of the camera.  In the viewing window, any position of the camera is selected and it is saved as a ‚Äúhome‚Äù position.  If you need to turn the camera to this position, the ‚Äúhome position‚Äù icon is pressed on the viewing screen and the camera rotates into this zone. <br>  - the ‚ÄúAlert Zones‚Äù setting, where you can select the status (whether or not the mode is enabled) and the control mode (activity control inside or outside the zone. The control zone is drawn on the viewing screen. <br>  When movement is detected anywhere around the camera, it turns to the source of movement, but when movement disappears, it returns to the control zone.  From the side looks impressive! <br>  Translated into a cat, it looks like this.  The cat lies at the entrance to the mink and hypnotizes it with its look at the appearance of the mouse.  At this moment you come.  The cat will look at you, but then again will turn his gaze on the mink, continuing the difficult hypnotic work; <br>  - in the sound alerts, in addition to the sound file selection, one of three volume levels is available; <br>  - formatting the SD card installed in the device; <br>  - add new users in view mode.  At the same time, the name of the new user is entered, the type of his authorization is selected (application or browser), login data is provided to the <a href="https://live.amaryllo.eu/">live.amarullo.eu</a> site (login and password).  Any user can be removed from the list; <br>  - the ability to turn on the rotation lock of the camera by the owner - I'm the eldest here!  if at this moment it is twisted by other users included in the viewing list; <br>  - disable alerts for any period up to 60 minutes; <br>  - adjustment of sensitivity in the night mode (the darkest, darker, normal). <br><br>  <b>Nothing complicated.</b> <br>  Many people are frightened by the difficulties that arise when connecting surveillance cameras of the previous generation. <br>  iCamPro eliminates this problem.  Easy installation allows you to simply, quickly and independently connect the Kolobok without the involvement of specialists. <br>  To do this, you need only a few actions: <br>  1. Download the ‚ÄúAmaryllo‚Äù app for your smartphone / tablet, launch it, enter the name and password of your Wi-Fi network. <br>  2. Turn on the camera and wait for the blue LED to flash, show the camera the QR code from the application screen. <br>  3. Everything, the camera is working! <br>  If necessary, further ‚Äúfine‚Äù tuning allows you to customize the Kolobok as ‚Äúyour heart desires‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Himself handsome.</b> <br>  Usually we watch video from surveillance cameras, not particularly interested in the cameras themselves. <br>  But iCamPro refers to those devices that themselves attract increased attention to themselves.  This is an object that can be watched as a cat playing to understand its behavior. <br><br>  We used to wait when the TV warms up, and now - when the operating system boots. <br>  Kolobok is not more stupid than the TV.  After powering on, the operating system is loaded for 25 seconds and the connection is set up, then the camera ‚Äúkneads the bones‚Äù - calibrates the mechanical system, checking, as the aviators or submariners would say - yaw and pitch. <br>  The process from two angles (the first 25 seconds are not the most dynamic) is shown in the films: <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5A6GUtTPcwA">iCam PRO.</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5A6GUtTPcwA">Calibration, side view</a> . <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DuzdQ-Bkw2nM">iCam PRO.</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DuzdQ-Bkw2nM">Calibration, top view</a> . <br>  45 seconds after switching on, the camera is ready for combat duty at any time of day at a distance of up to two meters from the nearest outlet in the Wi-Fi network coverage area. <br><br>  <b>Circular defense.</b> <br>  iCamPro detects movement on one of the three PIR motion sensors (passive infrared sensors) located on the device's body at an angle of 120 degrees, which provides a circular ‚Äúdefense‚Äù zone, and turns the upper part of the body face (camera lens) in this direction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b3/af8/9da/3b3af89da850464bb470939a1279cef7.jpg"><br><br>  From whatever side you approach her, the ‚Äúhut‚Äù turns in front of you.  There is no need to ask, and this is even cooler than in the fairy tale about Baba Yaga, especially since it looks much nicer than the hut on chicken legs. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fBk59wpm_g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhKMp6fFLAHMLebJumO23gVuE9CCA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Pro sensors are well written in the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/257748/">article</a> ‚ÄúTheory and practice of passive pyroelectric sensors or how to make an indicator of the direction of motion‚Äù. <br><br>  The angle of rotation of the upper part of the body in the horizontal plane is 340 degrees due to the limitation at the location of the connector.  Given the field of view of the camera in the horizontal plane of 100 degrees, this noise is not relevant - Gingerbread Man has a full circular view. <br>  The upper part of the body when it reaches the stop makes a turn back and continues further tracking of the target.  An example is shown in the film. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WMjvNlEwhKc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiOjwpbKIM6hEU1LU87a4wilE66Hg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>I see the goal.</b> <br>  After hitting the target in the lens, the intellectual algorithm begins to work, analyzing the resulting image frames with simultaneous tracking of the object of observation by rotating the upper part of the body.  If there is not enough horizontal rotation to fix the object in the frame, the camera rotates the lens in a vertical plane by -25 +10 (a total of 35) degrees. <br><br>  At the same time, the facial recognition algorithm works.  If the object has changed its position, the lens adjusts more precisely to keep it in its field of vision - an attentive cat! <br>  The words ‚ÄúI am my own!‚Äù Do not help yet; Kolobok incorruptibly continues to monitor movements, which distinguishes him favorably from the human operator. <br><br>  Although the camera's operating mode assumes its use at home, one Chinese comrade installed iCamPro on a car (white camera is preferable: Sun, heating), where he explored his Kolobok <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5J7-ztJ5VQA">day</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dk5mtfe7oJE4">night</a> . <br><br>  If you disable all three motion sensors, then Kolobok monitors the movement of people in the image frame. <br>  During the experiment, due to the absence of a horizontal section, iCamPro in the car was installed on the book, which was held by a hand, therefore image vibrations are sometimes noticeable.  Also sometimes there is a movement of air in front of the camera, it works by blowing the ventilation glass of the cabin. <br>  The distance to the store's porch is about 10 meters, and the camera quietly produces a ‚Äúgrip‚Äù at such a distance that it will guarantee reliable work in a comfortable office.  An interesting algorithm is the tracking of the target, interception, termination of tracking, the influence of color, speed, object size, etc. <br>  Only the ‚Äúears‚Äù of the observant ‚Äúcat‚Äù were seen ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52e/d40/5fe/52ed405fec20498bbcbf6539a52dd831.jpg"><br><br>  Music played in the car, Kolobok listened to it and recorded it too.  Immediately after uploading the received video to YouTube, it was reported that the video was blocked in some countries due to one song.  I had to remove the native sound and impose on the part of the movie a safe YouTube sound track.  In order to evaluate the parameters of the camera, the video is best viewed with 1080p quality. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uzzUmpgZCAs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjJQGIhB-OeIPhwHBFn9MyD9iuiZg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>The night Watch.</b> <br>  With an insufficient level of illumination, the camera switches to black and white mode of operation, including for illumination infrared LEDs - 4 or 8 pieces, depending on the darkness in the room.  The range of their actions to honest 5-6 meters.  If there is no movement at night, the backlight LEDs are turned off and the camera uses PIR sensors.  When movement appears, the camera turns on the IR flashlight and ‚Äúlifts its eyelids‚Äù. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1iCFa0eBXrU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgBn4Wu8qiCoROIvVEoVDcJi44UWQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Even in complete darkness Kolobok independently monitors the room.  The high resolution of the camera allows not only to find a black cat in a dark room, but also to discern the finer details of the image.  In the infrared light can be seen every speck of dust. <br>  If you need to assess the degree of wear of bed linen, clothes, etc., shake them in the room, turn off the lights, and understand everything when watching a video from the camera.  The more mysterious prana balls appear on the screen, the worse the state of matter. <br><br>  Speaking of matter.  Interestingly, with IR illumination, the black material with which the outlet of the active speakers is covered looks almost white in the video.  Black materials from plastic, iron, etc., do not hamelionitsya.  Thus, it is possible to distinguish the material of the object. <br><br>  It is possible that the backlight brightness control occurs in the PWM mode, since the photos of the camera itself are fantastic at this time.  Who can explain this? <br>  The whole ‚Äúflock‚Äù of such lighting engineering monsters ‚Äúruns‚Äù in the photo album. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/999/5e1/60d/9995e160dae64f1083be37fe38895e8e.jpg"><br><br>  After the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/267242/">article</a> about the thermal imager ‚ÄúSeek Thermal‚Äù, a device appeared in the arsenal that allows you to see objects in the warm, inaccessible to our eyes, part of the spectrum.  The wooden surface of the table in the IR range works like a mirror. <br>  Thermal imaging measurements of temperature in various parts of the body can also be seen in the photo album. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4JgnCTHL_9U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgGcapg9wCEH3yAJFnPrCE75tu-ew" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Disadvantages of classic surveillance cameras and artificial intelligence</b> <br><br>  To increase the field of view, use wide-angle cameras.  But as a result, the person in the image turns out to be small and his identification becomes difficult. <br>  To make the object occupy a sufficient part of the frame, the cameras are made narrow-angle.  But in this case, to cover even a small room, it is necessary to purchase several such cameras with a small sector of view.  This necessitates an increase in the number of communication channels and observation screens by the number of zones, switching between cameras, increased attention, high load on the operator and other problems.  All this "flies a pretty penny." <br>  The way out of the situation is the PTZ cameras, which successfully combine the optimal angle of view and the covered viewing area, up to the circular one. <br>  But to control such cameras requires an operator who performs the necessary manipulations to track the movement of an object. <br>  Ilon Mask <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/12/01/2016/569442709a7947ffd3d388fb">said</a> that Tesla will be able to create cars in two years that will cover long distances offline.  Thus, drivers fall into the class of endangered occupations.  Maybe that's why not everyone loves AI? <br><br>  The creators of iCamPro went on a similar way to use AI, and released a device that can be released from the work of video surveillance operators and specialists in setting up these systems. <br>  The intelligence of the camera and the complex of used solutions extends so far that the connection of Kolobok becomes ingeniously simple, secure and does not require inviting specialists, purchasing software for viewing, setting up an IP address and other ‚Äúproblems‚Äù. <br>  Kolobok replaces a huge complex for automatic tracking of an object that previously consisted of several cameras, communication lines, a system unit or a DVR, expensive specialized software, service organizations (that is, unauthorized people who know the type, presence and location of cameras). <br>  The headline of the near future newspapers: ‚ÄúKoloboks are back!‚Äù <br>  Prison talk: ‚ÄúGingerbread man caught me!‚Äù <br><br>  It is possible that the camera will become an element of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãsystem, as mentioned by another famous person of our time, Mark Zuckerberg. <br>  One of the most interesting and innovative functions that Mark Zuckerberg promised to implement is the function of monitoring a small child.  This feature should be useful to all young parents.  In particular, she will have to notify when the child woke up, fell asleep or needs to change a diaper.  <a href="http://www.novate.ru/news/4314/">Source of</a> <br><br>  <b>Man and woman.</b> <br>  If in terms of ease of installation, Kolobok looks like a man, then the abundance of options for setting up the iCamPro turns the device into a woman and provides numerous options for applying the camera in various situations. <br>  AI, like this, can not be fully studied.  It is not known how numerous switches and regulators are exhibited there at a particular moment in time, so the mind does not understand them ... but we will try. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df3/664/15f/df366415f3b74f27993a477e0bfd6acd.jpg"><br><br>  Light touches allow you to manually control them.

If necessary, mounting on a vertical plane or ceiling, use the bracket and screws supplied.  The bracket is made at a high level and allows you to quickly, easily and simply install the camera on the desired surface.  In the design, all elements are thought out, including the ‚Äúeyelet‚Äù for fastening the power cable and removing it from the rotating case.

Therefore, it is difficult to come up with alternatives to remote or cloud storage of data in our realities. <br>  This raises the problem of data security. <br>  ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù is not the main source of problems.  The main danger comes from ‚Äúour younger brothers‚Äù in the form of ‚Äúhackers‚Äù and other curious schoolchildren. <br>  In order to avoid stories similar to those described in the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269474/">article</a> ‚ÄúHackers crack video monitors ...‚Äù, the developers of iCamPro used many modern ways to protect information and storage options. <br>  iCamPro is part of a large set of technologies that provide viewing of live broadcasts and archives, cloud storage of records, receiving alarm messages and ensuring security at all stages of information transfer, starting from the initial registration of the device and ending with 256-bit encryption of the transmitted data. <br><br>  <b>Live images from the camera can be seen in several ways:</b> <br>  1. Through the application ‚ÄúAmaryllo‚Äù, which is available for devices with an operating system on: <br>  - Android 4.1 and higher on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Deu.amaryllo.cerebro%26hl%3Dru">Google Play</a> ; <br>  - iOS 7.0 and higher in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/amaryllo/id790556817%3Fmt%3D8">iTunes</a> . <br>  2. In the browser window. <br>  The manufacturer recommends using Firefox version 33 and higher.  When writing the article version 40.0.2 was used.  Checked - works. <br>  On the <a href="https://live.amaryllo.eu/">page</a> click on the cube with a plus sign and enter: <br>  Camera IDs iCRa <br>  Access code XXXXXXX <br>  Work with a couple of other browsers was also checked. <br>  Microsoft Edge (version 20.10240.16384.0).  When I tried to enter my login / password on the browse page, a message appeared that does not require translation: ‚ÄúPlease change your browser to Firefox or Chrome. <br>  Despite the last sentence, Chrome (version 47.0.2526.106 m was checked) is not suitable for viewing due to the lack of support for the H264 video stream.  Surely this is a temporary difficulty. <br><br>  <b>Archive records can be viewed:</b> <br>  1. Via the ‚ÄúAmaryllo‚Äù application, on the main screen in the ‚ÄúCloud storage‚Äù menu, after selecting the required storage. <br>  2. In Google Drive. <br>  3. With a microSD card having a cyclical recording mode.  To correctly complete the recording of the current fragment, when removing the card, you must put the device in confidential mode. <br><br>  Even in case of abduction or destruction, Kolobok will have time to send a text message and a photo of the offender to its owner.  The owner can enable two-way communication and ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with the criminal, which may reduce the damage from penetration if the conversation is convincing. <br>  The bad thing is that if at the time of the ‚Äúconversation‚Äù the owner of iCamPro is in a public place, then according to the current legislation, he faces a fine of up to one thousand rubles for using profanity. <br>  But the creators of the camera foresaw this situation.  Kolobok can use the built-in siren or ‚Äúchat‚Äù by itself, if you record beautiful voice messages in his memory (suggest options in the comments). <br>  So he (or rather, they) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DDdWOcygDDqA">welcomed the</a> visitors to the famous exhibition IFA-2015. <br>  So, in two eyes (I remembered traffic police officers: yes, we saw in four eyes that your belt was not fastened!) They <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLw92YX6m-ws">watched</a> visitors of IFSEC-2015 in London. <br><br>  Unlike other cameras, iCamPro possesses intelligence, and as a curious cat, it tracks moving targets on its own.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DR9UxtqEvRYs">An example</a> of a person‚Äôs movement in an office (I forgot to turn off the light when I left ...) <br>  Security at the enterprise using these cameras becomes much easier, safer and more interesting. <br><br>  <b>Not by bread alone ...</b> <br>  In addition to the main security functions, the use of iCamPro is much broader. <br>  An important area is the supervision of small children.  It can be not only a cot, a room in an apartment, a chat with a nanny, but also a kindergarten, a school class. <br>  Students miss ... student - great time! <br>  Growing up, some people still remain children, so they also have to be watched in the workplace.  This is not a panacea, especially for creative people, but it improves discipline, promotes and stimulates ... <br>  Managers can use the camera as a means of communication when conducting remote meetings. <br>  Thus, it is possible to observe a person from the moment of birth to old age.  Yes, old age, this is the period when sometimes you have to follow a person and communicate more often, even remotely. <br><br>  It is interesting to watch the camera recordings.  People see themselves from the outside, evaluate facial expressions, movements, gait, appearance, bad habits, posture, speech, which in many cases is useful for improving their image. <br>  Perhaps Kolobok will become a kind of image-maker, stylist and maybe even a psycholinguist? <br>  Light my mirror, say ... <br><br>  Wide medical aspects of the camera.  In addition to the above, iCamPro will help to explore the phases of sleep with precise timing, show that some owners of Kolobkov have a space connection with the Moon, making their journeys at night, to monitor sick people. <br><br>  For lovers of robotics, iCamPro can work as a telepresence robot head. <br><br>  Photohunt comes to a new level with the use of video traps at the base of Kolobok.  You can start with the bees, try to shoot a night video with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dm9Gy3qVnsj0">mole</a> restoring its earthen hill.  If you create a protective cover, then the bear can go. <br>  With pets you can just chat, or learn their habits. <br><br>  In automating and managing remote objects, objects, Kolobok will help to keep ‚Äúeverything under supervision‚Äù, which will reduce the number of long-distance trips to control the equipment. <br><br>  <b>More precisely does not happen.</b> <br>  One of the problems in analyzing various incidents is the determination of the exact time of the event. <br>  The time indicated on the notification screen, as well as the clock showing the time in video frames is very accurate - I checked it on satellite ‚Äú <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/257824/">Ideal clock</a> ‚Äù, where switching points in the upper part of the indicator corresponds to 15-second intervals. <br>  Video with a comparison of readings can be viewed in the movie ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnxY5uqdBKEQ">911</a> ‚Äù. <br>  Apparently, when shaping time, Kolobok uses clocks on Amaryllo servers. <br><br>  The minimum distance to the lens, from which it is possible to recognize the three-millimeter text, is 5 cm. <br>  High image quality and 1080p resolution allow you to increase interesting fragments of the frame for better detail. <br><br>  All control of Kolobok is intuitive, but some people are used to reading the instruction manual, therefore ... <br><br>  <b>User's manual</b> <br>  1. Turn on Wi-Fi on your phone. <br>  2. Connect the phone to the router (access point). <br>  3. Download the application ‚ÄúAmaryllo‚Äù to install devices, install and run it. <br>  4. Select the installation option (install a new camera, access from another device, install a new camera with a pre-configured network). <br>  5. Select the type of device to install from Amaryllo products: iCam / iBabe / iCare, iCamPro, iCamPro Deluxe, iSensor / Patio. <br>  6. Connect the micro USB cable from the camera to the power supply.  When the camera is connected, the blue LED will turn on.  It is necessary to wait a little for its blinking to start the installation. <br>  7. For models with remote control, it should take about 25 seconds before the start of the calibration process, when the camera reaches its extreme values ‚Äã‚Äãin the horizontal and vertical planes. <br>  8. Select the required Wi-Fi network and enter the password from your Wi-Fi router. <br>  9. The application in the device will generate a QR code. <br>  Rotate the image of the QR code towards the camera and keep the screen parallel to the camera lens at a distance of 10 ... 30 cm (smartphone) or 20 ... 30 cm (tablet) until a short sound signal appears confirming the transfer of information between devices.  The QR code contains information for connecting the camera to a Wi-Fi router. <br>  The timer will show the time remaining to complete the installation.  If the time has expired, you need to start the installation again. <br>  If the QR scan failed, a question will appear: ‚ÄúDo you want to try again?‚Äù With the answer options: <br>  - check information; <br>  - repeat. <br>  10. Two beeps will indicate that the installation of the camera is complete.  At the same time, a continuously lit green LED indicates the correct connection via Wi-Fi. <br><br>  Installation option with pre-configured network. <br>  1. Connect the phone to the router. <br>  2. Press and hold the WPS button on the router. <br>  3. Within 60 seconds after pressing the button on the router, press and hold the WPS button on the camera for five seconds or more.  When the green LED is blinking, it means that the camera is in WPS mode. <br>  5. Then follow the instructions of the application. <br><br>  <b>Reboot</b> <br>  Connect the device to the network and wait until the calibration is completed. <br>  Press and hold for at least five seconds the reset button located in the hole on the bottom of the case.  All factory settings will be deleted and restored to factory settings. <br>  Within 25 seconds, the camera will begin the calibration process, rotating around its own axis. <br><br>  <b>Temperature of use</b> <br>  Indoors, at temperatures from 0 to +35 degrees Celsius. <br><br>  <b>Indication</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14e/2d4/21a/14e2d421aef2449e9b0c0d5b731928e8.jpg"><br><br>  Blue LED. <br>  Lit continuously - the camera is connected to power. <br>  Blinks once a second - during a QR scan. <br>  Blinks twice a second - the camera is used in viewing mode.  That is, when someone is viewing the image from the camera, the blue LED starts to flash. <br>  Flashing three times per second - the installation process was successful. <br><br>  Green LED. <br>  Lit continuously - the camera is connected to Wi-Fi and works correctly. <br>  Blinks once a second - the camera is trying to connect to the Wi-Fi router. <br><br>  <b>Read the entire list please!</b> <br><br>  Although the entire list is quite extensive and is no longer complete (the new version adds new features, which was written above), it is advisable to get acquainted with these settings in order to learn the potential of iCamPro. <br>  All information is contained in the description of the ‚ÄúAmaryllo‚Äù application. <br><br>  <b>Main screen</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adf/b61/c75/adfb61c75c194dc6aa5e865f23406d3e.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúArrow / triangle to the right‚Äù - the beginning of the online broadcast of the image indicating the name of the camera. <br>  Image management is done by moving your finger across the image screen.

the highest level. About the camera and everything that surrounds it, a lot of positive is said above. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I would also like to note the attention of the inventors of Kolobk in thoughtfulness to every little thing, to the choice of materials of construction.
