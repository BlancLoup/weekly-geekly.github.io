      I think no one will argue that content is king.  And the site usually begins with it, as an information carrier. <br><br>  Based on this, we can conclude that no web studio will be able to make a really good website without very client participation.  No one knows their customers and market features better than the customer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3a21bec0/82b614eb/c3aa3a98/f2d602a4.jpg"><h5>  Oh ... it's necessary to write! </h5><br>  Often, before starting dances with a tambourine, a competent developer learns the maximum from the client about the target audience and what will be done with the site after launch to help manage a minimum of additional modifications in the future and save the customer time and money. <br><br>  This allows you to determine the structure of the site, its main sections. <br><br>  At the same time, the developer asks to provide materials for their completion, indicating that, in general, the site should show the advantages of the company, its products and services and confirm this with facts and figures.  Otherwise, why should the buyer choose company X from thousands of similar companies?  Web surfers haven't called the first available office for a long time and only believe the facts. <br><br>  Materials are usually not ready.  This is the first bell for you.  If at this moment it turns out that the customer does not want / is not ready / will not do it, even if together with you (and we often sat down with clients at the table and wrote materials ... on the leaves, in addition, describing which photos and illustrations need to do), from your joint venture will not work. <br><br>  Why?  We read further. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3c2635ff/a6d3f134/75675dae/f5b7fd93.jpg"><h5>  And here you want a red transparent line ... </h5><br>  Web design is an exact science.  Sometimes it is difficult to bring this to the client.  Although a lot depends on who is a designer and who is a customer. <br><br>  At this stage, they are trying to create everything.  Even the cleaning lady who accidentally looked into the office.  After all, they have a liberal company and all opinions are taken into account! <br><br>  In that case, if the materials from the previous paragraph have not been prepared, it is very difficult to substantiate one or another kind of pages, and you can never guess how the design of yours will look like in the end.  You will surely remain unhappy with the project, and the customer - with you. <br><br>  Design will have to redo it.  Usually from scratch and with a new developer. <br><br><h5>  And the site will be filled with ... well, at least he will! </h5><br>  He is a sysadmin (marketer / advertiser). <br>  I understand that there are system administrators who know how to write - you can download it, and marketers, who have studied html up and down. <br><br>  But as a rule, those who poked a finger and who have their problems in bulk are engaged in websites.  As a result, new materials spoil everything or are simply absent, although space is reserved for them in the structure.  They have no one to cook.  Therefore, the site will either have empty sections, or they will constantly tug you to help.  Not because they can not, but because they are too lazy to understand. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/461d06f5/cb955859/6d772a6e/3630b68a.jpg"><h5>  And who did this crap? </h5><br>  These are the words of the director, who after all decided to look at the site once a year.  He generously signed bills ‚Äúfor the Internet‚Äù, said that at last the company would become the most advanced, but somehow there was no time to look at the site. <br><br>  The director usually has a correct understanding of how the company should develop, and the site has its own special place in this strategy.  Only in a year you have done so much work, a lot of information has been shoveled, and the director will never see the work of this. <br><br>  And you will be the last.  After all, the money you "flock"? <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/28748a40/e992e597/0c0339af/eb7eca94.jpg"><h5>  Better a tit in the sky ... </h5><br>  I think that the result described above is unlikely to decorate your portfolio, but ... <br>  It is not necessary to abandon the client at all.  I am sure that normal developers have no competitors, but there are a lot of colleagues who are ready to ‚Äúpick up‚Äù your good-for-nothing client. <br><br>  In this case, you can simply conclude a contract of commission and officially receive a reward.  After all, any studio has sales managers who receive a percentage of the client's drive.  In your case, the bonus will not receive the manager, and you.  That‚Äôs all. <br><br>  This will also help to keep prices uniform for customers who come from you, and for customers who have turned to your colleagues themselves. <br><br>  By the way, such agreements allow you to significantly expand the list of your services, and communication of such customers with your colleagues can push to understand what they were trying to convey ... <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/040c79ed/d3ab63ab/b14f8492/ebe29963.jpg"><h5>  So who is our client, friends?  Maybe someone like that? </h5><br><ol><li>  Small business, where you can directly reach the owner.  He will understand you at a glance if you are, of course, an expert and understand the objectives of the enterprise. </li><li>  In the company, everyone who provides office work must use the Internet constantly to understand ‚Äúhow everything works there.‚Äù </li><li>  Most likely, the company does not produce industrial goods and is used to communicate more with people, not glands. </li><li>  To work with the studio, a person must be allocated who submits and reports directly to the owner, and if necessary organizes a meeting with him for the performer. </li><li>  Your partner from Clause 4 should really love your company and work, i.e.  one that simply cannot do its part (preparation of materials) badly.  And it will constantly monitor you too, so that you yourself do not screw up (not because you work badly, but because you are people too). </li><li>  Your client should be able to listen (and you too) to find solutions to problems that arise.  Ability to work together with them is the key to success. </li><li>  ...? </li></ol><br>  PS I suppose that sites are a piece product, and therefore only large companies can earn (a lot) on the development of other sites, where everything is put on stream (usually at the expense of quality), or very well-known companies that can afford to work on one resource long term. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127964/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127964/</a></p>
