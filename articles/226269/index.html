  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smooth transition to distributed Internet?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/225909">this</a> article and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/225909/">discussing it</a> , some thoughts arose about the possible development of the Internet towards independence, decentralization and anonymity.  With these thoughts, I want to introduce you, dear users of this wonderful resource. <br><br>  First, two ‚Äúwarnings‚Äù: <br>  1. The proposed idea is not ‚Äúone more soc.  Bitcoin-type network ‚Äù, so please do not make hasty conclusions. <br>  2. Although I have never heard of such projects, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  If you know about something like this, or you know why everything is guaranteed not to work - please write, I will delete the article and we will save the time of other readers. <br><br>  So.  Let's start with what today is a social network?  In fact, there are two types of networks - regular and distributed. <br>  Ordinary - often are massive, and they <b>already have a</b> lot of people.  These networks seem to be all good, but they are easy to control, so there will always be problems with confidentiality, security, anonymity and other ‚Äúprohibitions‚Äù from people who put their interests above others. <br>  In contrast, there are various distributed solutions for communication and file sharing, but there are usually very few people there, which makes them relatively uncommon, and therefore highly specialized.

      <b>Is it possible to combine the benefits of traditional soc.</b>  <b>networks with distributed?</b>  I think that it is possible. <br><br>  I have an extension in chrome, it allows you to download music from one well-known site, simply adds a download button to each song.  But what if the downloaded melodies are made available to other users of the site (who have our extension installed)?  Then it turns out that if this melody is blocked by the right holder - then it will remain in social.  network, it will just be loaded not from the server, but from the computers of other users, like a torrent. <br><br>  It seems that this will require integration with social services.  network, but in fact it is not.  Our extension simply adds new elements to the social interface.  network.  Buttons ‚Äústore locally‚Äù are added to the page with music and video, to the search page, except for the results of social.  networks - add search results to our distributed network. <br><br>  Thus, those people who do not like blocking, instead of looking for other platforms (which are becoming less and less), can install our expansion in two clicks and see ‚Äúa world without dictates and prohibitions ...‚Äù.  But this is only the first step.  If you are interested in 3 more - welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Step 2.</b> <br>  Suppose we have passed the first step and got an extension that can store files of any one social.  network and provides users with access to these files through distributed channels, but right inside their favorite social.  network. <br>  Of course, it is logical to store not only the data that the user has marked as stored locally.  You can save new and / or claimed files, those files that have disappeared from the network servers and so on.  It is logical to create some local storage, for each user (its size is determined by the user) where to store all the data in encrypted form. <br><br>  Let it all work, but why limit it to files only?  You can, for example, also store user messages.  Then if both the sender and the recipient of the message have installed our extension, then you can send the message not through the social site.  network, but through our distributed system, naturally encrypted.  Thus, for example, business users may eventually install an extension and, while communicating within their environment, do not worry that someone will read their mail.  To communicate with other people, they do not need to change the familiar tool or ‚Äútransplant‚Äù all their friends into a distributed network.  Yes, communication with those who have not yet installed the extension will not be safe, but usually there are no special secrets.  In any case, to put an extension is a one minute deal. <br><br>  How will the extension work in this case?  To send a message to a specific user, you need to somehow link his account within the distributed network, with his account in the usual social network.  network. <br>  You can offer this option.  The user is registered in our extension, indicates his login / password for social.  network (eg. "VKontakte"), then, to confirm the fact of ownership of this account, the extension on his behalf publishes on his page in the social.  network random key, and distributed network sends a verification request.  Other clients automatically check for the presence of code on the page, after which the registration is confirmed and the code is removed from the page.  The whole operation can take a split second. <br>  Thus, in the distributed user database, information is saved that such an account in the distributed network corresponds to such an account in the social network.  network.  When sending messages to this account - they are sent directly to the owner of the distributed network. <br><br>  Of course, all this will only work on the site social.  networks where the extension can be downloaded.  In other cases, for example, in the mobile client, the user will not see additional content.  For mobile devices will have to develop a separate social client.  networks with support for distributed functions or use a browser with support for extensions. <br><br>  <b>Step 3.</b> <br>  So, now we can transparently store music and movies within a distributed network, as well as exchange information within it and between it and the social.  network.  But you can go further.  Almost all content is social.  networks can be gradually transferred to a distributed network.  And each user will store their content, plus some of the total. <br>  This will allow to realize three goals over time. <br>  1. Add autonomy site.  for example, see your photo albums or listen to music - the user can even without Internet access.  because they are stored locally. <br>  2. Provide partial protection against blocking.  After all, by this time we essentially have a client, there is content and there are opportunities for data exchange.  Even if the site is "parent" social.  networks will be blocked - it will remain inside the distributed network and can retain most of the functionality.  Yes, some things can not be realized, such as applications and games.  But the main content will remain. <br>  3. Provide partial anonymity.  If the user sets in the settings "to receive only content from a distributed network" - then social.  the network will not receive information about what content and when the user received. <br><br>  <b>Step 4.</b> <br>  In the previous step, we achieved the integration of the principles of a distributed network into a normal social network.  network.  You can say you have achieved the goal, but you can go even further. <br>  Why do we work with only one social.  network?  Why our application does not work with others? <br><br>  Of course to achieve embedding in another social.  network (or a regular site) content stored by users - you will have to take into account the structure of this new social.  network.  Those.  create a template that describes what content is stored in the database, where it is taken from and where it is being implemented.  Moreover, a significant update layout social.  the network may require making changes to the template (of course, key data, for example, correspondence in all services, can be collected on a separate independent page so as not to lose touch in the event of failures). <br><br>  All this will require additional work, but we are talking about social.  networks with an audience of tens and hundreds of millions.  I think among them there are always enthusiasts ready to help, especially since software development can occur within an already existing distributed network, completely anonymously.  In addition, I assume that social networks will only be happy to create such a system (perhaps even informally they will finance it).  After all, the application unloads the social server.  network, almost without reducing the flow of users.  In addition, now soc.  networks are forced to balance on the verge of law in order to attract users with ‚Äúillegal‚Äù content, but not to have big problems with rights holders.  And in conjunction with our social system.  networks will be able to ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù delete content from their servers, while remaining clean in the eyes of the law, but at the same time attracting users to the presence of this very content. <br><br>  All this leads us to the question of where to store all this data?  And what about the "clouds" - which allow you to "unload" the device, to make life easier and easier? <br>  Why not?  <b>Who said that user data should be stored by the same company that provides it with a service</b> ?  Why, for example, do not store data vk.com - on google-drive?  And the gmail.com data is on a yandex disk?  Once setting up such a broadcast with data encryption "on the fly" - we will get unprecedented control over our data.  That's exactly what we all want to deprive.  The Internet can become much freer and more decentralized than ever.  At the same time without losing convenience and simplicity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226269/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226269/</a></p>
