  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sweetbay: Extreme Rebranding</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last night, I attended an event from the <a href="http://www.amaboston.org/">Boston American Marketing Association</a> called "Sweetbay: Extreme Rebranding."  It was awesome!  I bring my notes.  (I took a few paragraphs from the case of the VIA below). <br><br>  <b>Event</b> <br><br>  It was a presentation of how the Kash N 'Karry supermarket brand in Florida was reincarnated in <a href="http://www.sweetbaysupermarket.com/">Sweetbay</a> .  Kash N 'Karry was an unsuccessful network of 103 supermarkets in the western part of the Florida mall.  The growing price competition from Wal-Mart and the main competitor of this market, Publix, meant that either Kash N 'Karry would do something, or it would face a financial collapse.  Kash N 'Karry asked VIA's brand strategy company to help it create a new brand, since VIA already had a good experience with the Hannaford Bros. supermarket.  Co, owned by Delhaize Group. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      To awaken the essence of the future brand, VIA began by developing 5 brand themes.  Each topic was a reflection of the strategic position that the company intended to take in the minds of consumers in its marketplace.  After extensive research, Kash N 'Karry has determined that there is a niche in the market for a company that is positioning itself as a company that is a fan of food trading.  Publix's dominant competitor included food as part of its brand positioning, but for Publix food was not the main topic.  Kash N 'Karry decided that she had the opportunity to settle in the minds of consumers, like a supermarket that specializes mainly in food.  VIA performed a naming exercise for the company: 13 top managers of the company were involved in the work, who could pick up a name for the supermarket that would take in the mind of consumers exactly the place they wanted, Sweetbay. <br><br><img alt="Sweetbay logo" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" src="http://www.sweetbaysupermarket.com/Images/Common/logo.gif"><br>  Sweetbay is a virginian magnolia that grows in the Florida area and local people are well aware of it.  This name evokes the image of food, thanks to the word sweet (sweet) - dessert or sweets - and bay (bay) reminds consumers of Tampa Bay, where the company itself was located.  Then VIA helped Kash N 'Karry to design the logo.  At the last minute, the director of the Delhaize Group, advised him to choose the second of the three proposed options, since he was partly related to the Hannaford Bros logo.  Co, which VIA once developed for Delhaize.  The logo includes iconic images of food, an apple, bread, and sweetheart at the letter ‚ÄúY‚Äù in sweetbay, indicates the passion that the company employees have for their work. <br><br>  Having chosen the themes and finished with the design of her essence, Sweetbay began to design the entire store and its image as part of a new brand strategy.  In addition, he carefully thought out the range of food that was planned to be sold, how it would be placed in their stores and what the pricing strategy would be.  Sweetbay did not necessarily strive to continue working with already existing Kash N 'Karry customers, she intended to attract consumers who would become big fans of the food she offers and would agree to pay a high price for her quality.  Sweetbay conducted powerful training for her employees to be confident not only in their dedication, but also in food awareness. <br><br>  Sweetbay launched a 10-month promotional campaign dedicated to the opening of its new stores.  Campaign tactics included outdoor advertising, a mailing list, a flyer (in-store materials), radio sponsorship, print advertising, road signs (site signage) and a new website. <br><br>  <b>results</b> <br><br>  In the new stores Sweetbay sales rose 30-40 times compared with the former sales of Kash N 'Karry.  Publix responded by reworking its marketing message and focusing on the topic of food.  Now Sweetbay is engaged in remodeling of its existing Kash N 'Karry stores, in accordance with the new name Sweetbay, hoping to spend 5 to 3 years on this.  The lesson I learned from this story for myself was how Sweetbay actually analyzed its market to determine an empty niche and then started developing a strategy that allowed it to position itself as a leader in its target category, food! <br><br>  Steve Smith (Steve Smith), president of marketing from Sweetbay, well told;  he enthusiastically described how his company went through it all.  In addition, as a client and a participant in the process, he spoke about how rebranding is arranged from the inside, starting from the director‚Äôs insight about choosing a logo for Sweetbay and ending with why the design proposal was accepted to package their goods so that they look armored.  John Coleman, Co-Founder and Co-Founder of the VIA-group made a wonderful review on branding importance for the company, and Julia Brady, Head of Client Strategy from VIA-Group, ran through the whole brand strategy process. , after the conception that Steve made. <br><br>  <b>Translation from English to:</b> <br>  <a href="http://blog.worldwebstudio.com/">blog.worldwebstudio.com</a> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30897/</a></p>
