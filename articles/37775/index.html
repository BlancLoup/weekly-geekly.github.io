  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The story of an eyewitness who was lucky to play Fallout 3 (Few spoilers)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I already had the opportunity to play Fallout, but the huge size of the world is confusing when you first enter it.  Therefore, I did nothing worthwhile, wandered through the wastelands, blew the hats off the Raiders. <br>  But this time I was more purposeful.  I went straight to Megaton (One of the largest cities built around an unexploded bomb), took a task from one of the residents there and went to the outside world to fulfill it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I had a task without mandatory deadlines - to deliver a letter from a Megaton resident to his relatives in Arif, a settlement nearby.  I stopped to put a waypoint on the place of the city in my pipboy and went to my goal.  Several giant moles and rabid dogs bothered me during the journey, but everything went relatively smoothly until ... <br><br>  While I was not distracted.  Here you go to your goal and a beacon appears on the map and now you turn off the path to check it.  In principle, this was in Oblivion and in the old parts of Fallout, not surprising.  I was just surprised how easily and uncontrollably the game distracted me from the paved course.

      And my attention was attracted by the signature that it was a refuge.  Not Refuge 101, from which I began my journey, but Refuge 106. Searching through the crevices of rocks, I quickly found the massive doors of refuge.  The switch on the control panel, to my surprise, worked.  The gear mechanism of the door has earned, as smoothly and smoothly as during the time of its construction. <br><br>  Once inside, it became obvious that this shelter was not as lucky as my 101st.  Despite the fact that no one could leave my refuge for many years, we were still lucky - the hardware worked like a clock, there were enough reserves. <br>  And the 106th looked as if a bomb exploded inside.  Everything was rusted, tables were turned upside down, chairs were broken, computers were broken and sparkled.  It all looked like nothing more than abandoned ruins.  But then I realized that not one ... <br><br>  In the distant hall, I saw a woman wearing a Vault 106 suit. I went to say something, but she attacked me with a pipe.  She was definitely out of her mind. <br>  Here something definitely happened and I had to find out what exactly.  Along the way, I met more and more residents of the asylum, they attacked me, attacked each other, and then I saw a flashback ... <br><br>  I walk down the hall and see my father.  But when I walk up with him, he disappears. <br>  The lower I went down to Vault 106, the more flashbacks I saw.  Memories from my childhood left and came again, my old friends and enemies appeared here and there.  What the hell is going on here ?! <br><br>  Everything became clear when I found the science lab.  After hacking the computer, I learned the true purpose of Vault 106. <br>  You see, this shelter is not meant to save people.  It was one of the mass social experiments, a small sacrifice for the sake of saving and planning the survival of large masses. <br>  Shelter 13 was created to find out how people will behave if they run out of water chips in a few years. <br>  An experiment was carried out in Vault 101 to see if people could survive without hope of salvation. <br>  Asylum 106 was designed to find out whether special psychotropic gases will contribute to stabilizing the population and resistance to stress, to improve survival rates.  Exactly 10 days after the close of the Vault, this gas was released into the air filtration system.  At the same time it was the reason and my visions. <br><br>  Uncovering this mystery, I headed for the exit from the Vault.  After 30 minutes, I still did not budge.  It turns out I just walked in circles, the map shows where the exit is, I go there, and the map shows that the exit is already in another place, and then again in another and again ... The monotony of the walls of the rooms clearly did not help in orientation. <br><br>  No, I'm not crazy.  The architecture is changing!  Furniture is moving!  This shelter was created so that they came here, but no longer left. <br>  No, all the same, no special tricks.  The exit was in the same place where I entered, only cleverly made up. <br><br>  So, I have to round off with the game at the press show, the letter was not destined to deliver. <br>  Here it is, the soul of Fallout.  No one knows where he will be lucky.  And each next step can lead you to unexpected adventures. <br>  Eh, October 28 is coming so slowly ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37775/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37775/</a></p>
