  <section class="page js-page"><h1>4 applications that help me save on basic expenses</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am a typical St. Petersburg resident paying a mortgage and living in a rented apartment.  Over time, I have formed the main items of expenses for which I try to save - food home, business lunches and dinners in cafes, hotels, clothes.  To do this, I use 4 applications on a mobile phone, each of which helps to save in a certain category of spending. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Foodedil </h2><br>  At chain stores like ‚ÄúPyaterochka‚Äù, ‚ÄúDixie‚Äù, ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù, goods are constantly sold at a discount ‚Äî the entire price list can be studied in a weighty booklet that usually lies at the checkout.  The booklet is not needed at home, because hardly anyone will study it carefully.  There is no time to read the brochure completely in the store either, and why, if you can explore the site.  But then the question arises: what if competitors have a better deal, but have you already plunged into the Magnit campaign? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/74f/eb7/138/74feb7138fcce4c87dce3d106d6af0d0.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  To stop worrying about where the discount is more profitable, I use Foodadil.  The application collects data on discounts from booklets of the most visited supermarket chains - ‚ÄúReal‚Äù, ‚ÄúMagnit‚Äù, ‚ÄúLenta‚Äù, ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù, ‚ÄúPyaterochka‚Äù, ‚ÄúNetto‚Äù.  Products in the application are divided into 9 categories, within each there are subcategories.  For example, you want to buy chicken: go to the ‚ÄúProducts‚Äù category, choose ‚ÄúPoultry‚Äù.  Now the application will show you the nearest store where you can buy it at a discount. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/09a/e97/e50/09ae97e50a6eae5218d44e775ae8fbad.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Similarly, categories with alcohol work: choose the strength of the drink and the application will show the nearest wine shop at a discount if you were looking for wine.

      Pleasantly pleased that Fooddil works outside the two capitals.  I, for the sake of interest, turned on the application when I was on a business trip in Tver, and it works: displays discounts and indicates distances. <br><br><h2>  Booking </h2><br>  I often use the Booking application for three reasons: business trips, recycling, and divorced bridges.  A wide choice of hotels allows you to find the nearest one on the map and immediately leave a request.  This is especially true when business trips are unplanned - conferences, unscheduled maintenance, or personal presence is simply required.  For example, completing the first meeting, I already understand how many nights I spend on a business trip and can immediately book a room for a specific number of days. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c67/c9d/61a/c67c9d61aeca35b1dc787b1129b71ebb.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Due to the fact that I work in an international company, sometimes requests for maintenance come from colleagues from the east coast of the United States.  The time difference makes itself felt: the task director is now 11:00, we already have 21:00, and the solution may take 5 hours.  It turns out that by the end of the working day we already have one in the morning, the metro is closed, and the bridges are about to be reconstructed.  And in order not to waste money on a taxi, not to steal from myself for an hour and a half of sleep and to go to work on time, I look for a cheap hostel or hotel in advance using Booking. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c77/e07/ce5/c77e07ce5525f3b5924413eeea8263ea.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><h2>  City life </h2><br>  To visit the cafe and cinema, I use the City Life card, with which you can get discounts and cashback in various stores and establishments.  The card works including the network Ginza, Grizzly.  In addition to restaurants, laundries, garages, recreation centers, and pastry shops are connected.  There is Uber in the mobile application of the card, so you can pay for a taxi ride with accumulated cashback, which is convenient. <br><br>  I visit restaurants not so often, so I can allow myself some freedom of choice: the average check in such a place is large, taking into account the discount and a 5% cashback, I get 100-200 rubles from an order that I can spend on paying at any other restaurant. <br><br>  It is also interesting that City Life works in 50 cities of Russia.  Arriving in Yekaterinburg, for example, I choose where to go for lunch on the site, this greatly helps save time for choosing places to rest in a new city. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c1/a5f/867/9c1a5f867e61560097e438b31d7fd9fd.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  I buy clothes online at Lamoda, Proskater, Adidas, Nike, so as not to waste time going to the mall.  Online stores of well-known brands are connected to City Life, so you can get cashback from online purchases.  It is also convenient that the Uber service is integrated into City Life (and with the latest changes, Yandex.Taxi). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5bd/026/c37/5bd026c37a484b50ae41a926871eb825.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Purchase conditions remain the same as without City Life.  Cashback - partner bonus from the fact that cashback service brings more customers to the store.  The money saved is withdrawn from the account of the personal account, taken into account at a discount in a restaurant or when paying for Uber. <br><br><h2>  Spender </h2><br>  Personal and family budgets require a separate simple application that will help control costs and reduce debit and credit.  I spend all the expenses in Trangire, an application that takes into account expenses on purchases in a few simple steps.  The interface is intuitively simple, so filling out expenses is not like full-fledged accounting with a bunch of positions: <br><br><ul><li>  chose a category </li><li>  entered amount </li><li>  confirmed </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3aa/39b/fc0/3aa39bfc098965bc12e9f3b84894c5fd.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  For each day, I can look at my expenses to plan a budget for the next day.  It also helps to track when I paid for the car MOT - it is convenient for me. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/243/859/c1a/243859c1ac5ce2f3a1e486d6c9ebf2e7.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  And, of course, I can view the entire expense and balance for the month down to the individual categories. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/987/3ff/422/9873ff42250a22b72c596e1e32f7a4d6.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Professionally managed budget can be at the tariff "Premium" for 75 rubles per month.  It allows: <br><br><ul><li>  store data on the developer cloud </li><li>  set spending limits </li><li>  integrate currency converter </li><li>  keep statistics online from a PC or Mac in the form of beautiful business reports </li><li>  Set password </li><li>  open a large set of icons for manually created items </li></ul><br>  An extended version will be useful for a family with an average salary, a mortgage and a small child.  The functional monitors all budget changes and helps to identify unnecessary costs. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Often, applications clutter up the memory of a smartphone and, over time, only the most necessary and convenient ones will remain.  They reduce the time for each of the daily tasks of working with the budget.  Thanks to this set, I spend less than a minute on finding a hotel, less than 10 seconds on accounting for one cost, 2 minutes on finding a restaurant and calling a taxi. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373703/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373703/</a></p>
