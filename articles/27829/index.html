Become an active Internet user since 1970. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/115/047/f69/115047f69106581f511eb7460ba562e2.png" width="221" height="274" alt="ESR" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><br>  In general, it was a bit of a forced hobby, since in childhood he suffered from mild cerebral palsy.  Known as <strong>ESR</strong> since 1998 since its introduction on <strong>Slashdot</strong> . <br><blockquote><h3>  Slashdot </h3>  ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot">Slashdot</a> or /.) Is an English-language news site that specializes in technical and interesting technical topics.  Most of the materials are sent by the readers themselves and published after verification by the editors.  Any material has a discussion that often grows to huge sizes, turning into a <em>flame</em> .  <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> works on its own <em>CMS</em> ( <em>Slash</em> ), specially modified to encourage meaningful comments and combat <em>trolling</em> .  Slashdot was founded in September 1997 by <em>Rob Malda</em> (CmdrTaco), then acquired by <em>VA Software</em> .  The site was actively developing, survived a large-scale <em>trolling</em> epidemic, and reached its peak of popularity in 2005, after which its popularity and the number of comments began to decline. <br><br>  <strong>Slashdot effect</strong> : The neologism <strong>‚Äúto become slashdotted‚Äù</strong> (about the site) appeared in English, meaning that a particular site (mostly unknown) is unavailable as a result of posting a link to it on a popular site (for example, on <em>Slashdot</em> (note or on Habrahabr: ) and, as a result, an explosive increase in the number of visits to this site, which is why the equipment is not enough to show everyone to the site. In the Russian version it is sometimes referred to as ‚Äú <em>Slashdot effect</em> ‚Äù (we all know the <strong>habraeffect</strong> :). </blockquote><br>  Programmer, author of a whole heap of books and articles, as well as part-time lawyer specializing in the protection of open source software ( <em>Open Source Software</em> ).  His name should be known to everyone familiar with the hacker culture.  Raymond is the current editor and keeper of the <em>Jargon File</em> , an online encyclopedic dictionary dedicated to hacker slang and hacker culture.  In addition, it was Raymond who in 2003 proposed using one of the figures of the game <strong>‚ÄúLife‚Äù</strong> as the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">emblem of hackers</a> . <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/145/ef0/65b/145ef065bc45363a19d7e95504042e26.png" width="140" height="140" alt="Glider" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><br>  Eric is one of the most important whales on which the open source movement was built and worth.  This was mainly due to his publication on software development methods based on an analysis of the <em>Linux</em> kernel development process and personal experience of managing the open project <em>fetchmail</em> - " <em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em> ". <br><br>  As a programmer, Eric worked on <strong>fetchmail</strong> , a number of libraries used in <strong>GNU \ Linux</strong> , the legendary <strong>Emacs,</strong> and other software products. <br>  <strong>ESR</strong> finally formulated the " <em>Linus Law</em> ", which states that with a sufficient number of eyes all the errors lie on the surface.  A deep mistake is one that is hard to find, but if there are enough people looking for mistakes, then they all become superficial.  <strong>ESR</strong> 's views on <em>open source are</em> slightly different from those of <em>Linus Torvalds</em> and <em>Richard Stallman</em> , they all share the ideology of open source, but if you briefly characterize their positions, the following goes: <em>Linus</em> and <strong>ESR</strong> differ on what is more important - <u>openness of the</u> code or <u>‚Äúfree‚Äù</u> distribution of programs (Raymond is a supporter of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù), well, Stallman, in general (imho), is completely against <em>proprietary</em> software. <br>  Eric received 150,000 <strong>VA Linux</strong> shares, which were valued at <strong>$ 32 million</strong> on the day of the company's first public sale of shares ( <em>IPO</em> ), although exactly one year later, their value decreased by about <strong>17 times</strong> . <br><blockquote><h3>  VA Linux is currently called SourceForge, Inc. </h3></blockquote><br>  In addition to his computer skills, Eric, as a versatile person, enjoys science fiction, firearms and martial arts (has a black belt in one of the varieties of taekwondo).  Religiously <strong>ESR</strong> considers itself a neo-pagan.  He is a supporter of the war in Iraq, regularly publishes his opinion on various political events in his <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">blog</a> . <br><blockquote><h3>  Incomplete list of ESR publications: </h3><br><ul><li>  "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" </li><li>  "The Art of Unix Programming" </li><li>  ‚ÄúTake My Job, Please!‚Äù </li><li>  "Homesteading the Noosphere" </li><li>  "The Magic Cauldron" </li><li>  "Revenge of the Hackers" </li><li>  "The Unix Koans of Master Foo" </li></ul></blockquote>

      <strong>PS</strong> My opinion is: <strong>ESR is</strong> not very well versed in politics and other dubious things :), but he is a great technical writer. <br><br>  <strong>PPS</strong> Much of the above can be learned from the movie " <em>Revolution OS</em> " in it telling about the history, monetization and other.  Here is a trailer for the Russian version of the film, and in general on Youtube there is a whole version in the English language, divided into 5 parts. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nj7hr7zHCDo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgPBwcj_p1vbDTZQA6aOFfATI61hw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <strong>PPPS</strong> By preparation of article it was used <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/998/856/25c/99885625c4851fa2db55cc5a994af971.jpg" width="200" height="70" alt="Google" hspace="10" vspace="10"></div>  . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27829/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27829/</a></p>
