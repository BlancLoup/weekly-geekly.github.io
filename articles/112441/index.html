Although, my recent university experience tells me that the student is not so poor.  And, in fact, you want to live - know how to spin!  Do you want an iPod?  Of course.  And the laptop also wants.  And there are enough clothes for every day to go in pairs in a new walk and there were not enough cabinets in the hostel.  So, apparently, the students and got to our service.  They are an advanced people, so they realized that you can buy everything fashionable and fresh abroad, but only cheaper than in Russia.

      There are a lot of really useful things that during the five years of study can greatly brighten up student everyday life so much so that something will remain in your head.  Only in Russia there are none or there, but somewhere very far away and at an exorbitant price. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/93/1f/931ffdd32b1f0a856b79ba5aadc124ea.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In general, comrades, oddly enough, in our list of gadgets that are useful for students, they are ... <a href="http://www.mcphee.com/shop/products/Emergency-Inflatable-Brain.html">brains</a> , because without them, unfortunately, no matter how cool you are, but you cannot even write off.  For 6.95 (about 210 rubles) dollars you will become the owner of a box with inflatable brains.  Come to the teacher, sit down to answer the ticket, inflate the brain.  For your sense of humor and resourcefulness, you will get your deserved top three.  Attention!  Doesn't work for all teachers! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1a/c3/1ac330a0e1e5bf0e495c25f7a1951437.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In order to ‚Äúcook‚Äù your brains without inflatable ones, a student needs to eat a lot.  Or a little, but at least fairly regularly and preferably inexpensive.  Rollton, doshiraki and other "bomzhatin" - this is what saves students from starving fainting, however, destroys the stomach and other organs of the digestive system.  <b>We</b> give the <b>second place</b> ... a <a href="http://www.gizfever.com/cup-noodles-timer-p-281.html">timer for noodles</a> for $ 11.99 (about 360 rubles).  Put a glass with ‚Äúfood‚Äù, pour in boiling water, and then set the time - 3 minutes or how much is needed, depending on what degree of swelling of macaroni you prefer.  After this time passes, the gadget will inform the entire hostel that your dinner is ready with a loud beep.  It is very useful for those who like to dump the computer and the abyss on Habr√© in the process of cooking.  Powered by batteries. <br><br>  Of course, if it is not essential items, then a great gift for the Day of the Fool roommate.  In addition, this trifle weighs a little, and if you collect a package with purchases, then from inflatable brains, believe me, it doesn‚Äôt weigh much weight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1f/8c/1f8c96ab956745efe60b4459140c8db0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Now seriously.  <b>Third place</b> in our list - the most important.  Because there are legends about the relevance of this subject in the student‚Äôs arsenal.  This is the <a href="http://www.livescribe.com/store/20070723002/8gb-echo-smartpen/p-408.htm">famous Livescribe Echo Smartpen pen</a> , with which you can literally ‚Äúdigitize‚Äù all your knowledge.  For people who are fond of science, this gadget is like a magic wand for Harry Potter: with the help of a special notebook in which you write, all information is recorded in the memory of the device.  There is a sound recording function, a calculator, audio playback, unless the tickets pull out, they don‚Äôt run and smoke for pies in the dining room.  Detailed specifications have been published in sufficient quantities, I will not repeat, I will only say that the pen is now available in the 8GB version for $ 199.95. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a7/5f/a75f1c70b683e2679365f3a0b0cfa616.jpg" alt="image"><br>  To carry textbooks and notebooks, you need a bag.  Only my experience suggests that during the semester the backpack resembles a mini-bar rather than what they are sent to study with.  But what is there to confess ... <b>Fourth place</b> .  In general, to keep your favorite drink always cold, we offer <a href="http://www.keepyourcooler.com/roraco1.html">a cooler bag with built-in speakers</a> !  Breaks in up to 20 cans!  Compatible with all MP3 and CD players, including iPod.  So now you can have a party wherever your heart desires.  The price of pleasure is 35.98 dollars (about 1,100 rubles).  Just take care of the liver.  For new bodies of scholarship is not enough for sure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/81/73/8173507f2354eb2aee450ba596feceec.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Well, the honorable <b>fifth place</b> is occupied by a <a href="http://www.geniegadgets.com/gadgets_uk/sharp-end.html">pencil</a> sharpener.  Honestly, humor among prudent British is not just black.  The hole with the blade is located right next to the cat under the tail.  And when you insert a pencil "there", a moan of pain and indignation comes out of the cat ... Here is such entertainment for 6.95 pounds or 340 rubles.  By the way, for those who do not like dogs ... or, ahem, on the contrary, loves, there is a version in the form of a dog. <br><br>  And finally.  Since the question of the "poverty" of a student remains open.  We, <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/">Ebaytoday.ru</a> , decided to support the ‚Äúfreebie‚Äù of those who selflessly nibble on the granite of science.  Anyone who sends a scan of his record with the last session will be credited with the amount of dollars that corresponds to the average score.  So study well is useful.  <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/den-studenta">Come, a freebie</a> , and neither fluff nor pen to you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112441/</a></p>
