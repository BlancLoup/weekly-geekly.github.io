      The developer of microprocessor cores MIPS, the company Imagination Technologies, in collaboration with leading Russian universities and the manufacturer of microcontrollers Microchip Technology - announces a series of seminars in Russia devoted to the new product for education - MIPSfpga.  <b>Four free one-day seminars dedicated to MIPSfpga will be held from October 26 to 30 at the universities of Moscow, Zelenograd and St. Petersburg.</b>  <b>In addition to them, MIPSfpga will be presented at a separate, paid seminar of Microchip Masters Russia in St. Petersburg / Zelenogorsk.</b> <br><br>  <b>Site to register for MIPSfpga seminars at universities</b> <b><br></b>  <b><a href="http://bit.ly/mipsfpga-russia-registration">bit.ly/mipsfpga-russia-registration</a></b> <br><br>  <b>Site for registration for the Microchip Masters Russia seminar</b> <b><br></b>  <b><a href="http://bit.ly/microchip-masters-russia-registration">bit.ly/microchip-masters-russia-registration</a></b> <br><br>  MIPSfpga - free licensed for university source code of industrial microprocessor core MIPS microAptiv UP.  This core is used as the basis of the Microchip PIC32MZ microcontroller, as well as the new platform for the Internet of Things - Samsung Artik 1. <br><br>  The MIPS microAptiv UP kernel is used in industry together with the chip design standard for the last 25 years, in which the processor and other components of the system on a chip are developed in the Verilog hardware description language, after which the description is transformed through several transformations into a mask microcircuits. <br><br>  The educational version of MIPS microAptiv UP - MIPSfpga - uses an alternative implementation path: the system description turns into configuration files for inexpensive student cards with user-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), often called programmable logic integrated circuits (FPGAs) or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) . <br><br>  This solution opens up many opportunities for education: <br><br><ol><li>  Students can build their own prototypes of systems on a chip, connecting the microprocessor core, memory and their input-output devices </li><li>  Internal registers can be connected to output ports and output information about the current state of the processor pipeline, caches and memory management devices.  After that, the processor can be started at a low clock frequency and observe its operation ‚Äúin slow motion‚Äù. </li><li>  Students can experiment with their own variants of caches, design multi-core systems with specialized coprocessors, experiment with the division of the task into hardware and software. </li></ol><br>  Thus, MIPSfpga occupies a niche between the simplified academic implementations of MIPS, which are traditionally used in courses on micro-architecture - and finished industrial processors, in which students learn the programming of embedded systems.  MIPSfpga is an ideal platform for teaching systems thinking at the intersection of hardware development and programming. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Venues and dates for MIPSfpga workshops, institutions and responsible instructors</b> <br><br>  <b>Imagination Technologies</b> Instructor - Yuri Panchul, Senior Equipment Development Engineer, MIPS Processors Division <br><br>  <b>October 26, 2015 - Moscow / Zelenograd</b> , National Research University "Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology" ( <b>MIET</b> ).

It is also advisable to pre-register in the Imagination educational program and download the MIPSfpga Getting Started and MIPSfpga Fundamentals packages.  The installer for the Codescape Essentials package and the OpenOCD software for working with the BusBlaster debug adapter is located inside the MIPSfpga Getting Started package. <br><br>  If you want to refresh knowledge of the basics of digital logic, concepts of hardware description languages, assembly concepts, architecture and microarchitecture processors before the seminar, we recommend that you download the free Russian translation of the popular textbook by David Harris and Sarah Harris ‚ÄúDigital circuit design and computer architecture‚Äù whose PDF file also available on Imagination Technologies' educational programs website. <br><br>  We are waiting for you at the seminar! <br><br>  Robert Owen, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/002/de8/568/002de856894f427cbfefbd542e48e194.png"><br><br>  <font color="#800080">University Programs Manager</font> <font color="#800080"><br></font>  <font color="#800080"><b>Imagination Technologies</b></font> <br>  <font color="#800080">e-mail:</font> Robert.Owen@imgtec.com <br>  <font color="#800080">Web:</font> <a href="http://community.imgtec.com/university/">community.imgtec.com/university</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00e/b2e/bbc/00eb2ebbc2d07503aa6b6f8fa2ee5697.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265045/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265045/</a></p>
