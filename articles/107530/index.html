  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An example to follow. Part 1 - Collect customer feedback</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you like to listen to bad things about the case that you do?  Not?  Then you do not have the skills of an entrepreneur.  Because a real entrepreneur understands that the offensive words of a disgruntled client provide more opportunities to improve business than the smartest books and the most certified consultants.  Let's consider today an example of an effective system for collecting feedback from customers. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, we repeat once again - constant feedback from customers is the key to a healthy business.  Without it, the company "goes into space" - begins to work not for customers, but for their ideas about customers.  And real customers are beginning to slowly creep away. <br><br>  Consequently, a business interested in maintaining its clientele should be as attentive as possible to it.  And to give people a simple opportunity to help make the company more convenient and more pleasant for them.

      <br>
      Who argues with this simple thought?  No one.  And who does that in reality?  Well, you understand. <br><br>  Paradoxically, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe importance of feedback is recognized by everyone as an axiom, but at the same time, 90% of businessmen do not want to know what, in fact, their customers are dissatisfied with.  This is especially true of businesses with a large man-stream.  There are many people, you will not please everyone.  You are many, and I am alone.  Do not like it - do not buy. <br><br>  This is a purely psychological mechanism - we all love to praise us.  And everyone does not like being scolded.  Therefore, so often we see advertisements like ‚ÄúWe are five years old - we accept congratulations‚Äù and almost never see advertisements ‚ÄúTell me, what else can we improve?‚Äù. <br><br>  In Krasnoyarsk, there is a restaurateur V.Vladimirov, who owns several chains of restaurants of various formats.  They all have something in common.  Here is a pyramid on the tables: <br><br><img src="http://www.marketing-audit.ru/netcat_files/Image/otzyv.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Stop for a minute.  This is the perfect implementation of a feedback collection system. <br><br>  I'll explain why. <br><br>  1. A ‚Äúhill‚Äù stands on each table - every visitor is informed about the opportunity to share impressions.  This is clearly understood and employees of the institution. <br><br>  2. SMS is easy and fast.  This is not a ‚Äúcomplaint book‚Äù to be ‚Äúdemanded‚Äù.  You can send sms in a few seconds, without getting up from your place, without forgetting the details and the intention itself.  Therefore, it is possible to report not only about something glaring, but also about trifles, or to praise, for example. <br><br>  3. SMS personalizes reviews.  On the one hand, it reduces the number of people who want to just send nasty things, makes them accountable, on the other hand, it gives the possibility of a reaction: to contact, find out the details, thank you for your feedback. <br><br>  4. Receiving feedback in the sms format allows reactions in real time.  This is not ‚Äúhitting the master‚Äù once a month - the hand is constantly on the pulse. <br><br>  5. And finally, the formal restrictions of the sms-format insure against grafomanov-complainants of multi-page essays.  Feedback will be brief and convenient for processing. <br><br>  What is the result?  We see the feedback collection procedure integrated into the service itself.  People can share their impressions directly in the process, without highlighting the response in a separate project called ‚Äúgo to quarrel with the manager."  It is very cool. <br><br>  Naturally, this technique is not suitable for any business.  Not everywhere you can "put on the table pyramid."  But the very approach to the question of organizing feedback deserves careful and thoughtful copying. <br><br>  By the way, Krasnoyarsk colleagues told me that Vladimir Vladimirov is the most successful restaurateur in the city.  It would seem, what is the connection? <br><br>  And what examples of feedback organization can you give?  Share positive examples.  Or negative - this is also useful, we will discuss. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107530/</a></p>
