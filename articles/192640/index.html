Further a lot of unfunny text without pictures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><habracut><br>  Citizens born in 1967 and younger registered in the compulsory pension insurance system in 2013 were given the opportunity to choose the insurance premium rate for the funded part of the labor pension: either leave 6% as it is today, or reduce it to 2%, thereby increasing the formation tariff insurance part of the pension from 10% to 14%. <br><br>  If a citizen in the past did NOT draw up any documents and did not write any statements regarding the placement of the funded part of his pension, then he needs to decide what his insurance premium rate will be for the funded part of his pension.  Now it is 6%, from 01.01.2014 it will be 2% by default. Reduction of deductions for the cumulative part of the pension from 6% to 2% will occur due to the redistribution of the delta in the amount of 4% in favor of deductions for the insurance part of the pension. <br><br>  <b>Below is detailed information about the structure of pension contributions, the funded part of the pension and how to keep the current 6% of the funded part of the pension.</b> <b><br></b> <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Category of insured persons</b> </td><td>  <b>Amount of deductions for financing the insurance part of labor pension</b> </td><td>  <b>The amount of deductions to finance the funded part of the labor pension</b> </td><td>  <b>Insurance premium rate</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Citizens born in 1966 and older </td><td>  26% (10% joint part of the wage fund + 16% individual part of the wage fund, but not more than 16% of 568,000 rubles per year) </td><td>  Not </td><td>  26% (26% insurance part + 0% funded part) </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Citizens born in 1967 and younger</b> </td><td>  20% (10% joint part of the wage fund + 10% individual part of the wage fund, but not more than 10% of 568,000 rubles per year) </td><td>  6% of the wage fund, but not more than 6% of 568,000 rubles.  per year </td><td>  26% (20% insurance part + 6% funded part) </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Deductions to finance the insurance part of the labor pension for any category of insured are accumulated in the Pension Fund of Russia (hereinafter the Pension Fund of Russia).

      Deductions to finance the funded part of a labor pension are currently accumulated in one of the following options: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Placement option for the funded part of the pension</b> </td><td>  <b>The option is valid in the case of</b> </td><td>  <b>Deductions on 12/31/2013</b> </td><td>  <b>Deductions from 01/01/2014 (default)</b> <b><br></b> </td><td>  <b>Comment</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  1.

It can be inherited.  The size of the funded part of the pension is determined by the profitability of the management company in which the deductions are invested.  Those.  until the citizen‚Äôs retirement, the funded part of the pension is formed from contributions to finance the funded part of the pension, as well as interest accrued annually by the management company on the amount of the funded part of the pension.  At the time a citizen retires, the amount of the monthly pension payment is calculated from the funded part.  Further, the cumulative part of the pension is monthly reduced by the amount of the monthly pension payment, and the management company annually charges interest on the balance depending on the degree of its profitability. <br><br>  In connection with the above, every citizen born in 1967 and younger, the funded part of the pension of which is currently placed under option 4 of the table, you must decide whether he agrees to the default reduction of deductions for the funded part of the pension from 6% to 2% in favor of the insurance part pension, or wants to keep the same amount of deductions for the funded part of the pension. <br><br>  <b>Algorithm of actions to save contributions to the funded part of the pension in the amount of 6%.</b> <br><br>  To save contributions to the funded part of the pension in the amount of 6%, you must decide on which pension fund (PFR or NPF) you want to cooperate with on January 31, 2013 from January 1, 2014.  The corresponding application to the FIU also need to be submitted before 01/01/2014.  Eventually: <br><br>  <u>CHUK and GUK.</u>  <u>If you want to stay in the FIU, then you must personally apply to the personal accounting department of the local branch of the FIU:</u> <br><ul><li>  For those who are permanently registered in Moscow or Moscow region, this branch of the FIU at the place of residence, for non-resident with temporary registration - branch of the FIU at the place of temporary registration or local branch of the Pension Fund of the place of residence, for non-resident in Moscow - this branch of the FIU at the place of actual residence in Moscow or the branch of the FIU at the place of registration / temporary registration. <br><br>  The address and telephone number of the local branch of the FIU (for a personal visit to his personal accountancy department) can be obtained by calling the territorial branch of the FIU.  <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/konpfr">List of territorial offices of the FIU</a> . <br><br>  Addresses and phone numbers of local offices of the PFR in Moscow and the Moscow Region can be obtained from the Territorial Office of the PFR in Moscow and the Moscow Region, 119602, Moscow, Akademika Anokhin St., 20, bld.

Details <a href="http://www.veb.ru/agent/pension/info/about/">GUK VEB</a> .  And put a mark of 6%. <br><br>  If you choose GUK VEB, then you need to specify which investment portfolio you choose, ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù or ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù.  At the moment, your default is Advanced.  What is the difference see <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/heading_company_stat">here</a> . <br><br>  If you select CHUK, then you indicate the name of the investment package when there are more than one in the ChUK.

But the question is little studied.  The technology is complex and opaque.  Therefore, in both cases, a personal visit is preferable. <br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  To select a management company and an investment portfolio, you can use the <a href="http://www.pensiamarket.ru/Ranking.aspx%3Ftype%3Duk">ratings of management companies</a> . <br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  To select the APF, you can use <a href="http://www.pensiamarket.ru/Ranking.aspx%3Ftype%3DNpf">the APF rating</a> . <br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  The size of the future pension can be estimated using the <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/spec/raschet_pensii">Calculator</a> . <br></li></ul><br>  PS If you find errors or inaccuracies - I will be grateful, it is important. <br><br>  PPS Update as of September 7, 13 00:26 MSK.  A little more about the joint and individual part: <br><br>  The rate of insurance premiums sent to the FIU contains: <br><ol><li>  The solidary part of the rate of insurance premiums </li><li>  The individual part of the insurance premium rate that is sent for financing consists of: <br>  * The cumulative part of the labor pension <br>  * Insurance part of labor pension <br></li></ol><br>  The solidarity part of the insurance contribution tariff is a part of insurance contributions for compulsory pension insurance intended for the formation of funds for the purpose of paying out a fixed basic amount of labor pension, social benefit for the funeral of deceased pensioners, etc.  etc.  In simple words, this is money that the FIU manages in real time and it does not affect the size of the future retirement pension. <br><br>  About the funded part is written in the article above. <br><br>  The insurance part of the labor pension is formed by deducting% from the payroll.  Therefore, the higher the salary, the higher will be the size of the future pension.  Contributions to the insurance part of the pension are received and summed up in an individual personal account.  In essence, this is an obligation of the state to the insured, since  funds in real time go to pay pensions to current retirees.  Those.  on the individual account there is something like the amount of the state‚Äôs debt to the insured.  Accumulated liabilities are regularly indexed. <br><br>  The procedure for indexation of the size of the insurance part of labor pensions (including their fixed basic amount) is established by clause 6 of article 17 of the <a href="http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi%3Freq%3Ddoc%3Bbase%3DLAW%3Bn%3D148787">Federal Law of 17.12.2001 N 173- ‚ÄúOn labor pensions in the Russian Federation‚Äù</a> .  In short: indexation depends on price increases, the annual growth index of average monthly wages and the growth of revenues of the PFR budget per one pensioner.  Decisions on the indexation rate of the insurance part of the labor pension can be found <a href="http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi%3Freq%3Ddoc%3Bbase%3DLAW%3Bn%3D148787%3Bdiv%3DLAW%3Bdst%3D100221">here</a> .
