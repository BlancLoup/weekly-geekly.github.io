      But seriously, there is an IT life outside the Moscow Ring Road.  And she is beautiful and unpredictable, like our Rita.  In this article we will describe how the developers live in the largest city in the south of Russia. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For ease of navigation, we broke the article into parts.  And for the sake of completeness, they provided the material with anonymous comments from people from the industry who saw Rostov IT specialists and the city itself ‚Äúfrom the inside‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/uteam/blog/311960/">Where IT pros come from: universities and self-development</a> </h4><br><h4>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/uteam/blog/311960/">Work and salary: a fork of income and company</a> </h4><br><h4>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/uteam/blog/311960/">Costs: before and after work</a> </h4><br><h4>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/uteam/blog/311960/">Why is not everyone rushing from Rostov to Moscow</a> </h4>  (and infrastructure jokes) </blockquote><br>  Go. <br><br><h2><a name="where"></a>  Where do ITs come from </h2><br>  Rostov is like Moscow for central Russia, just a little south-south-west.  In the sense that the city can not be considered in isolation from the same and neighboring areas.  First, everyone goes here, and there - as it will.  And one of the reasons for this - in the wonderful years of student. <br><br>  <b>Universities.</b>  There are three universities in the region, which have become the main suppliers of employees for IT companies.  These are DGTU (Don State Technical University), SFU (Southern Federal University) and a branch of SFU in Taganrog. <br><br>  If you look at these universities from the height of the ISS flight, you‚Äôll get something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57e/af0/ff5/57eaf0ff5f8741b3884bc3f9b1a8599a.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, the distribution across the region is uneven.  Therefore, about half of the people in local IT are natives of regional satellite cities who came to Rostov to study and stayed. <br><br>  <b>Their projects.</b>  One can always argue about who and how they are taught in universities, but a diploma is good, but real experience is somehow gained in projects. <br><br>  But no one will offer a project to a beginner.  Therefore, a novice should do the pet-projects in parallel with his studies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c32/62a/dd8/c3262add8a8e4dcfaad200e2cdaa5167.jpg"><br><br>  In universities, ‚Äústudent start-ups‚Äù are generally <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/uteam/blog/301056/">welcomed</a> and even can provide support: on the principle ‚Äúif it does not take off, there will be at least something to show the employer‚Äù.  Moreover, support is sometimes creatively approached: on the basis of DGTU, for example, they organized the whole reality show ‚ÄúStartup of the Year‚Äù to highlight smart guys in front of the industry ‚Äî the third season of the project will be released at the regional RBC. <br><br>  <b>Self-education and community.</b>  Looking up from reading Habrahabra and Stack Overflow, extraverts programmers go to meetings and conferences.  On average, 3-4 events per month take place in Rostov and neighboring cities. <br><br>  Since 2013, the Rostov IT Community website (it61.info) has been operating, where announcements of events and courses in southern cities are aggregated - if the event is interesting, drive forty, one hundred, or even more kilometers away is not a problem, so the selection falls not only purely Rostov events. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22d/3ef/827/22d3ef827584469d9701dde35b729589.png"><br>  <i>The it61.info team posted the source of the site on GitHub - so if you have long wanted to launch a similar resource in your city, <a href="https://github.com/IT61/it61-rails">use it</a> .</i>  <i>The guys also have a <a href="http://it61.herokuapp.com/">Slack chat</a> for a thousand people.</i> <br><br>  In addition to the target audience, the site is now popular with HR-s - because there you can find lists of people who signed up for meetings on a specific language or technology. <br><br>  Rostov presents the entire ‚Äústandard set‚Äù of events.  These are hackathons - select 47hours from regular ones, which takes place every six months on average. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b5/7b4/994/8b57b49940fc4ff280a2ba5ce36a08e1.jpg"><br><br>  These are meetings for frontendschikov, backendshchikov, testers and igrodelov, which begin with beautiful slides and a full hall ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/901/a33/de4/901a33de487e4539a8739c91f5bc64d6.jpg"><br><br>  ... And end, as elsewhere, gatherings of the most persistent in a cafe.  In addition to the establishments ‚ÄúTsiferblat‚Äù and ‚ÄúCreative space‚Äù, where you can hold an event and sit afterwards, the pub at the private brewery ‚ÄúCheshka‚Äù enjoys certain demand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a4/9dd/ba8/7a49ddba8767458e95bd8a3c2da21bc3.jpg"><br><br>  And, of course, it does not do without conferences <i>‚Äúwith the participation of employees of These Famous Companies‚Äù</i> (we quote the ‚Äústandard selling announcement‚Äù). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f72/767/55b/f7276755b965461881b5e412349ffe2b.jpg"></div><br>  But local specialists do not always strive to attend such high-profile events in Rostov - you can drive to Moscow for the names of large companies.  Moreover, good employers compensate for trips to the conference or buy videos from them. <br><br>  <b>Technoparks and coworking.</b>  Drinking smoothies in co-working is not a local tradition, but in Rostov there is a ‚ÄúSouthern IT-park‚Äù, a co-working ‚ÄúPlace‚Äù and a municipal co-working ‚ÄúUnder the roof‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b11/d05/250/b11d0525087745dc874689316141a83c.png"><br><br>  In addition to hosting free and paid industry events, these sites serve as mini-offices for interesting young projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26c/c4a/e1f/26cc4ae1fcce4286bc2fe4c599460526.jpg"><br>  <i>Mug will tell you where you are</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c36/35d/977/c3635d977abc4afd9cc38329310793ff.jpg"><br>  <i>Coworking "Place"</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/393/2df/bd3/3932dfbd3e8e4be693bbcd0962a29421.jpg"><br>  <i>Coworking "Under the roof"</i> <br><br>  <b>In general</b> , if a person wants to gain a foothold in Rostov and get into the field of view of people from IT companies, he should go to meetings and be in a party.  No one has yet canceled communications and personal acquaintances. <br><br><h2><a name="what"></a>  Work and salary </h2><br>  If you simplify, in Rostov and its surroundings you have 4 main ways.  Development of web services and high-load systems.  Game development.  Work in a web studio.  And work in an outsourcing company (perhaps even having clients abroad). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/155/2a8/b9e/1552a8b9e43b47ad85632a2445357e10.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Salaries of developers in Rostov are</b> not tied to Moscow, but it can be stated that there is a gap of about 20% in favor of the capital of our country. <br><br>  Average data for the city * can be summarized in a simple table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ec/a65/5f8/9eca655f8c844852a5bffa1b45a0e3f3.jpg"><br><br>  It is worth remembering that many places where freelancing is officially encouraged during off-hours - for example, in the memo of an employee of ‚ÄúYukoz‚Äù it is written: ‚Äúif you work as an extra worker, do not hesitate to tell about it - this can be an argument for increasing your salary‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Where to work?</b>  There is no lack of good companies and interesting tasks in the region: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5aa/f3b/917/5aaf3b9176ac4077ab7504f0a327fdae.jpg"><br><br>  And this is just offhand. <br><br><h2><a name="thisislife"></a>  Costs: life before and after work </h2><br>  With income sort of sorted out.  But they are not representative without a cost line.  Let us try to compare with Moscow by several household parameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ab/2e5/b25/2ab2e5b25a5c41eab55cfb5989962a11.png"><br><br>  <b>The Internet.</b>  The prices for wired Internet can be called ‚ÄúMoscow‚Äù conditionally, but here ‚Äúit's only mine‚Äù stories in Rostov come across more often - especially if you live in the center. <br><br>  <b>Apartment.</b>  The average cost of odnushki is 2.3 million, one-bedroom apartment is 3.4 million. Accordingly, the rent will cost 15-20 thousand depending on the location and the situation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6b/999/787/f6b999787ed24567bfc391e96f48ba46.jpg"><br><br>  With an average salary, rental costs, food, clothing, entertainment and other needs, saving for a decent apartment will be 15-17 years. <br><br>  <b>Food, boots, motorcycle.</b>  If you do not save, but do not glam, and take into account that the company pays for individual dinners in the office, then a set of products for one will cost 5-6 thousand. <br><br>  Cinema tickets for premieres in the evening - 200-300 rubles.  The average bill for going to the bar is 1000 rubles.  A taxi ride is one or two hundred. <br><br>  Getting there by taxi is from where.  In addition to cafes, entertainment centers and clubs, in Rostov there is a beautiful embankment, a steep water park, one of the largest zoos in Russia, and of other theaters, circuses and museums. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c6/970/e70/8c6970e706cd485095505a3ecf25f829.png"><br><br>  That is, on the one hand, prices in Rostov are about the same as in provincial cities.  On the other hand, it is the capital (the city is often called the ‚Äúcapital of the South‚Äù) - Facebook is much less often used here, Yandex is used by 2gis, and Rutaxi is quoted higher than Uber. <br><br><h2><a name="whysoserious"></a>  Why is not everyone rushing from Rostov to Moscow </h2><br>  Motives are different.  In order not to complicate things, we have gathered some funny reasons that reveal the pros, cons, and spirit of Rostov. <br><br><h3>  ‚ÄúThere is no sea there either‚Äù </h3><br>  Moscow is the ‚Äúport of the five seas‚Äù in which there is no sea.  Near Rostov there is also no sea: the locals do not consider the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov overseas to be shallow, and almost no infrastructure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b99/b4c/1eb/b99b4c1eb3b04e0aaf5de8e8e6799669.jpg"><br><br>  But on the Don there is a lot of recreation centers, and you can also rush to the Black Sea for the weekend - 5-6 hours of driving in total. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae7/f66/f67/ae7f66f676244a7381bc63872338174b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d69/97d/33a/d6997d33a7c64ad7ae87fb9b346d35b0.png"><br><br>  And for the winter there are ski resorts - tours to Elbrus, Dombay, Arkhyz and Krasnaya Polyana are especially popular on the eve of February 23 and March 8. <br><br><h3>  On the programmer's day ... </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c3/99b/c5d/9c399bc5d16943f49cbf1a0d0a8a2a71.png"><br>  And on September 13, Rostov IT specialists fry shish-kebabs near the office - at least in our ‚ÄúYukoz Media‚Äù they do that.  First, the air temperature has.  And secondly, we have an entire house with an own yard rented as an office. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56a/642/f75/56a642f75c534ac7a5d02b080347c35b.jpeg"></div><br>  In Moscow, this is almost always worse: with the temperature in September, with the space around the office. <br><br><h3>  freedom of choice </h3><br>  As you understand, local IT people do not like routine very much, and companies try to give them interesting tasks and freedom in all plans. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/316/f71/90b/316f7190b31f451b9d61f62da353c1dc.png"><br>  Finding comfort for an employee can go quite far.  For example, looking for an electric guitar and a drum kit in an office is a typical task for Rostov-based HRN. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd7/eec/7cc/bd7eec7cc22d4eb2a2d38ca40338563f.jpg"><br>  Rostov is a city of very musical people.  Especially on Fridays. <br><br><h3>  "We had our own CIT - before it became fashionable" </h3><br>  Meet this Rostov metro.  He is 30 years old and it <s>still lies on the furnace</s> still at the stage of the TK. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c82/bc0/41f/c82bc041fd9344a8b4bd5167ed4e0f82.jpg"><br><br>  The main transport of Rostov - bus for 19 rubles.  But someone for movement within the city learned to adapt to the schedule of electric trains and save 3 rubles. <br><br>  Why is that?  Most companies are located in the center, and the center is narrow streets.  The exception method works further.  Buy a car is not a problem;  to make the way through accumulations of other cars on a personal transport is the problem.  A bus or a trolley bus, even personal, is not as maneuverable as a minibus. <br><br>  But the train has a dedicated path. <br><br><h3>  "40 kilometers to Silicon Valley" </h3><br>  To find an interesting job and a good salary, a Rostov developer doesn‚Äôt have to move far and change the mild climate to continental.  The same neighboring Taganrog is partly seriously, partly jokingly called the ‚Äúlocal Silicon Valley‚Äù - Game Insight, Oggetto (e-commerce) and other interesting companies are sitting there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/826/61d/193/82661d193d384c7b92e69c09019316cc.jpg"><br><br>  And in general, a good IT specialist is in demand in the south: for example, in Krasnodar, IT-frames regularly recruit everything from Bankov.ru and Arkadium (game development) to the Magnit retail chain. <br><br><h3>  Still there is Peter and the whole world </h3><br>  The Rostov office is often not the only one for many companies, and it is possible to migrate between offices.  For example, within our company, a techie can move to St. Petersburg if they wish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fbf/701/d0a/fbf701d0a9f445fdae438c3de771e51b.jpg"><br><br>  Although, from Rostov you can just immediately rush abroad: air communication is well developed, so long-distance travels and crossings are far from having to start through Moscow. <br><br><h3>  And also Rostov is RnD.  <s>Checkmate</s> </h3><br>  RnD - such a consonant with Research &amp; Development abbreviation in Latin is applied to the name of the city.  It is for this comical and a bunch of other serious reasons that we keep two development offices in Rostov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6f/140/9bd/a6f1409bdd4e43ff86fd7d392a474c23.jpg"><br><br>  Come to <a href="http://ru.uteam.pro/vacancies%3Frnd">work</a> with us. <br><br>  <b>Notes:</b> <b><br></b> <br>  * The salary fork in Rostov is given according to the results of monitoring open sources (HH.ru, etc.) and a survey of several HR employees working in local IT. <br><br>  ** 28K is the average salary in Rostov-on-Don </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311960/</a></p>
