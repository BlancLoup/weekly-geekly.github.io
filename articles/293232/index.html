  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reduced staff turnover. 10 tips</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How would you react to a higher employee retention rate in your company? <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know about you, but I don‚Äôt know a single HR specialist who wouldn‚Äôt think about it. <br>  In fact, employee retention is undoubtedly one of the most intense challenges facing most HR departments, and the situation is unlikely to change for the better in the future. <br><br>  Moreover, with the advent of the Millennial era, which is becoming the main part of the workforce, the scale of the problem will only grow, since the representatives of this generation are characterized by a constant change of work. <br>  Here are some tips to help slow down the revolving door in your company.  Some may be familiar to you, some may not, but each will help inspire your best employees for the long-term loyalty. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Hire the right people.  Dismiss those who do not fit </h4><br>  I understand this point is not a revelation for anyone, but it is very important. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      The best way to ensure that an employee does not leave you is to be sure from the very beginning that you hire the right people. <br><br>  Clearly define the role of the employee - both for yourself and for him.  After that, make sure that the employee clearly corresponds not only with his professional role, but also with the corporate culture. <br><br>  It happens that even following this advice, we hire employees who, no matter how hard we try, just do not resemble.  No matter how effectively they perform their work, employees who do not fit into the team have a bad influence on the corporate culture, and this raises doubts among other employees regarding this culture itself. <br><br>  Such people are more likely to harm more than help in the development of the company.  Get rid of them. <br><br>  It‚Äôs not for nothing that many successful companies advocate such an approach: Apple, Google, Virgin or Zappos, which even offers a significant amount of care after staff training, thus sifting out ‚Äúnot your own‚Äù people. <br><br><h4>  2. Encourage generosity and gratitude </h4><br>  Encourage the prosocial behavior of your employees.  If you give your employees the opportunity to interact through acts of generosity, generosity, altruism, and expressions of gratitude, employees will be healthier, happier, and less willing to leave their usual and comfortable place. <br><br>  Motivating people to constantly express a positive, respectful and attentive attitude towards each other, you give employees a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the company. <br><br><h4>  3. Notice and reward your employees. </h4><br>  Show your employees that they are important, in terms of work, and are adequately evaluated by the employer.  Show them your recognition in real time, celebrating their success and contribution.  Let it be something special, individual, socially significant. <br>  Express your gratitude with a really tangible reward, not necessarily material and you will also be rewarded with the loyalty of your employees. <br><br><h4>  4. Offer freedom </h4><br>  Today's employees are eager for flexibility in finding the balance of life-work. <br><br>  This directly affects the effective retention of employees.  Over 50% of managers of modern companies point out the positive impact of flexible working hours on employee retention. <br><br>  And more and more companies are using these principles. <br><br>  Statistics show that if you do not give employees flexibility regarding hours and place of work, they can easily go to the one who gives. <br><br><h4>  5. Pay attention to employee engagement. </h4><br>  This seems obvious, but for many leaders, interest in employee engagement is limited to the results of tests for internal interaction.  But conducting a survey once a year is not enough! <br><br>  You must take action based on these results and work all year to build a culture of engagement and interaction in your company. <br><br><h4>  6. Employee happiness is the company's priority. </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThe happiness of employees‚Äù may not sound serious enough for many managers, but many companies confirm that this is a very important aspect. <br><br>  Employee happiness is an important indicator of job satisfaction and its relevance to their values, which means their return and attendance. <br><br>  Investing in the happiness of your employees very soon will bring you dividends in the form of engagement, productivity and of course, retention of employees. <br><br><h4>  7. Provide opportunities for development and growth. </h4><br>  Growth opportunities for employees, in their opinion, is of great value. <br>  A recent survey by the Cornerstone recruitment agency reflects a direct link between the lack of development opportunities and the growing intentions of an employee to change jobs. <br><br>  If you are not engaged in the development of your employees, then you do not invest in them.  And if you do not invest in them, then why should they stay with you? <br><br><h4>  8. Approach employees in a new way. </h4><br>  For most employees, annual and quarterly evaluations of their work are nothing more than a waste of time, and most importantly, they are not motivation. <br><br>  In Russia, the practice of ‚Äúperformance review‚Äù is not very common, so this issue should be approached very carefully.  The main thing is that such assessments are designed, among other things, to increase trust and strengthen relationships with staff. <br><br>  Constantly work on improvements in personnel performance management through adjustments to evaluation methods and you will see how the trust and satisfaction of employees grows. <br><br><h4>  9. Provide a comprehensive vision. </h4><br>  One of the key factors influencing the involvement and satisfaction of employees, according to many experts, is the awareness of the purpose and significance of their work. <br><br>  Provide employees with a clear vision of the desired result and you will increase their sense of belonging and loyalty to your company. <br><br><h4>  10. Show and cultivate respect </h4><br>  Finally, do not write off respect when it comes to creating a unifying corporate culture. <br>  There is more than one study that showed that lack of respect in the workplace is one of the key factors in changing jobs. <br><br>  Look for ways to develop and cultivate respect in the workplace, and this will return to you more effectively retaining employees. <br><br>  Published in collaboration with Daria Orlova. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293232/</a></p>
