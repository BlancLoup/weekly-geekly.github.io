But first, briefly about the new line of processors. <br>  The Xeon E5-4600 series consists of 8 processor models, with frequencies from 2Ghz to 2.9Ghz, power from 90W to 130W, with 4 to 8 cores. The younger E5-4603 model contains 4 cores and does not support Turbo Boost, This technology is not supported by the younger 6-core E5-4607 model.  The amount of cache memory of the third level they vary from 10MB to 20MB.  Processors support DDR3 memory, as well as Hyper-Threading, AES and Trusted Execution technologies. <br><br>  But now back to the culprit of our article - <a href="http://www.advanserv.ru/products/servery/4cpu/dell-poweredge-r820/">Dell PowerEdge R820</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c67/3a3/39e/c673a339e743fb67dd55875df41cf119.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

There is also a ‚Äútongue‚Äù with information about the MAC address of the iDRAC, a slot for an SD card with iDRAC and DVD-RW, and an information and diagnostic display with control buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95b/110/1fb/95b1101fbf8355bf776cc758bc12cd4b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f0/c15/5a7/7f0c155a77be6c70704439a0ec487edf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The compactness of installing 4 processors in a 2U server is that the processors and memory are ‚Äúdivided‚Äù into 2 boards, <br>  which are interconnected by the dual Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QPI), providing 8GT / sec speed, it also connects all processor sockets in one ring.  The top board is conveniently removed and securely fastens into place with a fairly large handle with a bracket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/623/6d9/22a/6236d922a768f0670ca6038ddfb3044f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.advanserv.ru/tag/Poweredge/">PowerEdge servers</a> are the first in the world with an integrated Instant-On control system that supports instant access and quick setup with the touch of a button without using additional media.  The lifecycle controller allows the administrator to prepare the server for the OS installation.  All drivers for all OS supported by the server and the installation utilities are located on a special flash drive built into the server motherboard.  This eliminates the need to use disks with drivers and utilities. <br><br>  To increase performance, servers are equipped with Express Flash PCIe-SSD solid-state drives connected directly to memory and processor buses.  They can be used either as a disk cache, for example, to store a paging file, or as a very fast disk for placing frequently requested data on it. <br><br>  For servers of the 12th generation, the iDRAC control system (Dell Remote Access Controller) is supplied in a new, seventh, version.  The iDRAC7 accesses the server console via a separate Ethernet connection, even when the OS is not running or there is no normal network connection.  It provides in some cases the same functionality as KVM, but with additional options. <br>  The iDRAC7 remote access control controller allows you to diagnose processors, memory, disks, etc. At the same time, diagnostic utilities are stored on a flash drive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a6/b8e/03b/2a6b8e03bafed85f037df74a8b5eae7a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, these built-in functions also allow you to automatically install updates, manage changes, and reliably perform system diagnostics. <br>  PCIe slots, a complete set of which can satisfy the needs of almost any consumer for various kinds of expansion cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d20/60c/abc/d2060cabc0189d0155441579d46c7580.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d11/151/aa8/d11151aa891515e2e51c94ad1ce60189.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The back of the server contains 2 USB ports, 4 network adapters, a COM port, a monitor output, an iDRAC adapter, and (as in our case) 2 power supplies that can be hot swapped. <br>  <b>Dell</b> , as always, is pleasantly pleased with the build quality of its servers.  Every time I have to work with Dell solutions, I get a lot of fun.  But I want to "scold" the cooling system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eba/25f/033/eba25f033ad777faadc49f036d0409f8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The DELL <a href="http://www.advanserv.ru/products/servery/4cpu/dell-poweredge-r820/">PE R820</a> server has 6 coolers installed (against 4 installed in PowerEdge R710), which behave quite noisy during the boot phase.  And the load time, taking into account the number of expansion cards installed in our server, is quite large.  But this is probably the only disadvantage of this server.  Despite the noise during the boot phase, the Dell platform again shows low noise and heat generation during operation.  Coolers, of course, hot-swappable. <br><br>  Considering all the above, I would like to note that Dell is strengthening its position in the server market by actively competing with solutions from HP and IBM.  And given the fact that this is the first platform for Xeon E5-4600 series processors, the model is extremely attractive for purchase, because in 2U format you can fit a reasonably productive system that solves many of your problems. <br><br>  Please note: our warehouse almost always has the required number of the most popular models of Dell servers, for example, <a href="http://www.advanserv.ru/products/servery/4cpu/dell-poweredge-r820/">R820,</a> <a href="http://www.advanserv.ru/products/servery/2cpu/dell-poweredge-r720/">R720</a> , <a href="http://www.advanserv.ru/products/servery/2cpu/dell-poweredge-r620/">R620</a> and others.  You can configure the required server model <a href="http://www.advanserv.ru/configurator/configurator-serverov/">here.</a> <br>  You can find out the exact price from our sales managers. <br>  When you <a href="http://www.advanserv.ru/">buy a</a> server from <a href="http://www.advanserv.ru/">ADVANSERV</a> , you get the Start package as a gift: a free visit of an IT specialist for installation, installation and first start-up of server equipment, as well as an IT consultation - for free! <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/korp/" class="user_link">Korp</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162037/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162037/</a></p>
