      My friends know that I love the sun, the sea and the sand.  But Kate said that her honeymoon in the forest is her dream.  I liked the idea, because I flew to the planet Sargon 10 years ago from places, let's say, not at all rich in vegetation.  For me, hiking in the taiga is still an exotic adventure.  Katya is a native inhabitant of a ‚Äúwild‚Äù planet covered with coniferous forests. <br><br>  Wildness of the planet was conditional.  Being at any point of even the most remote forestry, not further than a couple of kilometers you can always find a hidden sanitary booth with a shower and toilet.  There will also be power supply.  When, more than 100 years ago, the YEAR was in charge of everything on the planet, he installed thousands and thousands of booths all over the planet.  It even seems to me that most of the booths have never been visited.  If we take into account the wilderness we climbed, then the cabins around are probably pristine clean. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The day trip was over, and I, setting up a tent, fumbled in backpacks, choosing food for dinner.  Katya was sharpening one edge of a shovel, which also served her with an ax.  She loved to chop firewood herself, to lay down and make a fire. <br><br>  - Oleg, listen, does your phone support scanning of bio-sinnate? <br><br>  - Yes of course! <br><br>  - And let's install the application Shared Truth - Marriage! <br><br>  - Hmm ... <br><br>  After registration of the marriage, the husband and wife on the planet Sargon could install the Shared Truth - Marriage application on their phones.  In this application, you can ask any question about the past spouse and get an answer.  The question may concern any fact in the life of a partner.  There are only two rules: <br><br>  A) The application is installed simultaneously on two phones of the spouses, with their mutual consent.  One spouse cannot install the application alone. <br><br>  B) After installation, you can ask one question.  The next question you can ask only after your partner asks your question. <br><br>  The application "Shared Truth - Marriage" is only part of the information system of the planet.  There is, for example, its application for the police.  If there is an open case, they can request facts about the suspects, which allows you to instantly open most cases. <br><br>  Arriving 10 years ago on the planet Sargon, I was shocked to learn the history of the local SupremeAI - the planet of artificial intelligence with self-awareness.  For nearly a thousand years, the Global Data Organizer, abbreviated YEAR, single-handedly ran the business on the planet.  He continuously monitored every inhabitant of Sargon using sensors that flooded the planet so tightly that no matter where you are, YEARS saw you, felt your breath, pulse, pressure, eye movement and much more. <br><br>  However, a hundred years ago, Sargon joined the commonwealth of central civilizations.  The arrived artificial intellects of the central civilizations were much more powerful than the YEAR.  Based on the ideas of the absolute human will, the YEAR has cut all functions, returning control of the planet to people.  But the sensors remained!  He still saw and knew everything, however, he could only give out information on requests from special applications, such as Shared Truth - Marriage. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, Catherine,‚Äù I said in an official tone, ‚Äúif you want, let's install and find out all the details about each other!‚Äù  I have nothing to hide!  Nearly. <br><br>  - That is how it is almost?  - with feigned indignation Katya exclaimed. <br><br>  - And what are you, absolutely nothing to hide? <br><br>  - Or maybe there is!  For example, maybe I twisted romance with your witness at the wedding? <br><br>  - HH-what, what? <br><br>  I quickly unlocked the phone, found the application in the store and clicked on the install button.  The bio-signature scan sensor flashed and a message appeared that it was expected to confirm the installation on the partner‚Äôs phone.  I looked at Katya inquiringly. <br><br>  Katya peered intently at the phone.  Her scan sensor blinked and the application was installed to both of us.  A welcome message appeared on my phone: <br><br>  ‚ÄúYEAR: Oleg, ask any question about Kate‚Äù <br><br>  The interface of the application was terribly outdated - it was necessary to type the question on the on-screen keyboard.  Throwing a glance at Katya, I scored: <br><br>  ‚ÄúDid Katya cheat on me?‚Äù <br><br>  Almost immediately I received the answer: <br><br>  "YEAR: No" <br><br>  Chuckling, I looked at Katya.  Here she finished typing your question.  She waited for an answer.  And ... something strange began to happen to her.  Her face turned white, she trembled, and tears flowed from her eyes. <br><br>  - Katya, what happened?  - I ran to her and tried to hug. <br><br>  - Dont touch me!  - through her teeth, she hissed, throwing me a hated look. <br><br>  The change was dramatic.  It was as if a completely different person was sitting in front of me.  I did not know such Katya.  From a cheerful girl, looking at me with loving eyes, Katya turned into a ball of hate. <br><br>  - What?  What did you ask about me there?  Is this about my life before I flew to Sargon?  So know, I have changed completely - I'm a completely different person! <br><br>  Katya was silent. <br><br>  - Maybe you found out who I work on the planet?  Yes, the work is not very, but it is legal here! <br><br>  Katya looked sharply at me, but said nothing. <br><br>  - Hell yes!  You asked about my work.  We had to say before!  Do you want me to leave her?  Here we go back from the trip - and right away! <br><br>  Kate closed her eyes and said quietly: <br><br>  - Oleg, promise me, please, that you will not ask about me in the application. <br><br>  - Of course of course! <br><br>  Although the request sounded strange, but I pointedly poked at the phone lock button.  The application, however, has not yet become deleted.  Painfully unusual reaction was Kati.  Since she asked her question, I can now ask one more.  But then. <br><br>  - Well, let's cook!  - I said with cheerfulness, getting up. <br><br>  - Yes, really, it's time.  Today I will cook my sister's mushroom soup according to the recipe, ‚ÄùKatya said, starting to set up the pot over the fire. <br><br>  We started cooking dinner.  Following Kati‚Äôs sister‚Äôs recipe, you had to peel and chop a lot of different ingredients.  We brought some of them with us, Katya collected a part in the forest.  I constantly looked at Katya, trying to understand her mood.  She looked away. <br><br>  And what do I actually know about Kate?  Not so much.  Passion so captured me that I lost my inherent vigilance and meticulousness.  Katya was one of the best rangers on the planet.  For many years she had been offered positions in companies on much more developed planets.  But for some reason she refused.  And this is despite the fact that according to her, she loves to travel. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, Oleg, try the soup,‚Äù I heard Katy‚Äôs warmer voice. <br><br>  She handed me a plate. <br><br>  - And how are you? <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd I'll wait for the soup to cool down a little.‚Äù  You know, I can't eat too hot. <br><br>  I began to eat.  Yes, the soup was good!  I drained the plate in a minute.  At first I wanted to ask for supplements, but suddenly I was beginning to feel sleepy.  It seems that I did not want to sleep at all when I started eating.  In a tangle of tongues, I asked in jest: <br><br>  - Katya, have you put sleeping pills into the soup? <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is not a sleeping pill,‚Äù Katya answered, and then I saw that she no longer looked away, but looked at me point-blank. <br><br>  This look.  I have seen such looks before.  Long.  It was in a past life and in another world, where only one out of a thousand survived.  I was alone because I was ready for such views.  But here ... Thoughts began to get confused and I fell into unconsciousness. <br><br>  I woke up to a strange recurring sound.  With difficulty opening my eyes, I saw what was the source of these sounds.  Katya dug a hole.  I immediately understood - this is a grave.  For me. <br><br>  What kind of strength poison Katya used, even if my, built into the stomach, the system of neutralization of toxins did not fully cope with it.  On this "wild" planet about such systems and do not know, probably. <br><br>  Suddenly, Katya stopped and turned her head in my direction: <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, and you are resilient, brute!‚Äù  - She said, jumping out of the pit. <br><br>  I tried to move, but my hands and feet did not obey me.  I need to gain time. <br><br>  - W-s-why?  - I said slowly. <br><br>  - Well, since you did not die immediately, I will tell you before dying.  You know what I asked about you?  I asked if you killed my sister?  And you know, it was you. <br><br>  Katya intercepted the shovel, turning it with the sharpened side in the direction of the blow. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThree years ago, I promised myself to find everyone involved in the murder of my sister.‚Äù  I found everyone except the artist.  According to the stupid agreement of the planet, the YEAR and central civilizations, the perpetrators of contract killings were taken out of charge.  The tool is not judged.  But I decided differently. <br><br>  Kate came to me at a distance of one and a half meters, put her legs shoulder-width apart and took a shovel with both hands.  The shovel was at the level of my neck. <br><br>  - I carefully read the laws.  It turns out that blood revenge is derived from our responsibility.  Here is a transitional period of entry into the Commonwealth.  A hundred-year term is given, during which our ‚Äúwild‚Äù rules of life, introduced a year ago, are valid.  I can take revenge and I will not be anything for it.  It only remained to find the performer, the rest was calculated by the police. <br><br>  Katya slowly began to swing her shovel, raising it above her head. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI started finding killers like you through illegal channels.‚Äù  The only way to find out the truth was to marry a killer and launch the Shared Truth - Marriage application.  I lured assassins, married them and made a request to the application.  Then she got divorced.  So it was four times.  You are my fifth husband.  And ... bingo! <br><br>  The sharp edge of the shovel rushed to meet my neck.  Beat a well-trained ranger is very strong.  I think that the head will fly off after the first attempt.  Thoughts earned at a frantic pace, unlike the body.  Well, now it is clear why Katya did not leave the planet.  She was looking for me to kill.  It can be understood. <br><br>  Watching the spade movement, as if in slow motion, I remembered a hundred-year agreement.  Arriving on Sargon, the forces of the commonwealth of central civilizations found that artificial intelligence named YEAR, completely subjugated the population of the planet.  It simply didn‚Äôt happen to remove YEARS due to the fact that YEARS could have destroyed the entire population of Sargon in a couple of seconds.  His mechanisms were everywhere on the planet.  Therefore, the community had to negotiate.  A tripartite agreement was concluded between the Commonwealth, the YEAR and the government of the planet.  Does Katia know about all the clauses of this agreement? <br><br>  Finally, the blade of a shovel slammed into the tissues of my neck and everything plunged into darkness.  Forever and ever.  Nearly. <br><br>  A revelation appeared right in the center of my consciousness: <br><br>  ‚ÄúYEAR: Welcome to the virtual world, Oleg!‚Äù <br><br>  My thought process, interrupted by death, earned again.  What was I thinking about?  Yes, about the agreement.  For refusing any opportunity to act in reality, the YEAR received the opportunity to scan the brain of every person who died on the planet and load a copy of the brain into its circuits.  In each sanitary cabin there was a flying module with a scanner.  Not more than a few seconds after his death, the scanner was already in place to make a copy.  After death, all fell to the year. <br><br>  New insight shone the following information: <br><br>  ‚ÄúYEAR: You were given the opportunity to think this thought out on your own.  Now your consciousness will be thrown into the cauldron along with the consciousness of another hundred people.  Fight for survival!  Maybe it is your mind that will become predominant in a hundred.  Then you will enter the pot of a hundred winners.  I need one human supermind. ‚Äù <br><br>  It sounded frightening, but nothing, I have been in places worse.  Where out of a thousand one survives.  And there are only a hundred.  I wonder why this YEAR for this supermind composed of millions of people, if he himself is a superintelligence who has ruled the planet for a thousand years? <br><br>  ‚ÄúYEAR: Your question requires an answer.  I was weak in front of the artificial intelligence of the community.  The technology of their schemes are superior to mine.  But in central civilizations, man is absolute, and I will make myself in the image and likeness of man.  The best man. ‚Äù <br><br>  I did not have time to think anything further; my mind was attacked by the chaos of thoughts of many other people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427795/</a></p>
