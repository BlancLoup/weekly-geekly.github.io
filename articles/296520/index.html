The Verge made it to the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/a/2014-verge-50/lev-manovich">list of people who define the future</a> .  Before Manovich had a computer, he had been writing code on paper for two years. <br><h3>  Software is the message </h3><br>  For Manovich, the key fact is that all media on the Internet is controlled by computer programs.  Software is the message is one of his articles.  This is a clear controversy with Marshall McLuhan's Media is the message. <br><br>  McLuhan believes that the medium of information transfer determines what information should be.  A television program with a charismatic leading and dynamic video series will be more successful than a program led by a person with a pleasant voice against the background of the ocean.  But on the radio presenter with a pleasant voice will win.  In the online media message becomes the program. <br><br>  From what programs we use, it depends on what content we will produce well and which is bad.  It depends on the right choice of software, we will achieve as a result of the effect on the material, which we wanted or not. <br><br>  The problem is that most still do not know how the medium works.  We do not understand how the devices and programs that we use in work and in life work. <br><br><h2>  Jeff jarvis </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jeff.jarvis%3Ffref%3Dts">Jeff jarvis</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8ea/24e/fd3/8ea24efd3b94b58c5c59fd60e532b3ad.jpg"><br><br>  Jeff Jarvis is director of the interactive journalism program at the University of New York. <br><h3>  Media is a service </h3><br>  The media should stop perceiving the audience as a mass.  Such an understanding remains of the past media: the journalist produces a message and has the ability to spread it. <br><br>  The media themselves created the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmass, and it kills them.  The media should take a different look at their business.  This is not content production.  Their business is a service.  Service is something that improves life: it makes it convenient and comfortable.  To do this, you need to perceive the audience as specific people and communities.  Before you begin to solve the problems of these people and communities, you need to understand what the problems are.  The plumber does not come to you every day, with the words: "Let me fix the toilet for you."  Plumber needed when the toilet is broken. <br><br>  The important point: the service needs to know if it was able to solve the problem. <br><blockquote>  To my entrepreneurial students from the Faculty of Journalism, I give the broadest definition of [journalism]: journalism helps society organize its knowledge so that society can better organize itself.  Thus, everything that reliably serves to inform the public is journalism. </blockquote><br><br><h2>  Henry Jenkins </h2><br>  <a href="http://henryjenkins.org/">Henry jenkins</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dd8/c54/715/dd8c5471510051f7c51f32de2a0a8e35.jpg"><br><br>  Henry Jenkins is a professor of communication, journalism and film at the University of Southern California.  One of the first to ask was the question of changing the audience in the media with the development of digital technologies. <br><h3>  Participation culture </h3><br>  Since the Internet made it possible to comment on posts and communicate in forums, there has been a cultural leap in society.  The Internet has made us different.  We will not be just content consumers.  More recently, we could watch TV, read a newspaper, and then speak, poorly written or good. <br><br>  Jenkins is sure that now you cannot create a successful media that simply informs.  Media must be created taking into account the fact that the user will take an active part in the production of the product.  Therefore, one should not create content and give it to the masses, but create a convenient environment where users themselves can, and most importantly, want to produce content.  The task of the media manager is to come up with a mechanism that will be collected by users who want to independently generate and develop media content. <br><br><br><h2>  Ken Doctor </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kendoctor%3Ffref%3Dts">Ken doctor</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/44a/f65/a8a/44af65a8a942c54152978f3b76006662.jpg"><br><br>  Ken Doctor - Research Analyst, Nieman Journalist Lab.  Actively investigates media and information reporting formats.  His ideas on new ways of delivering news expressed in the book Newsomics. <br><h3>  Wins the one who has the correct format </h3><br>  What matters is not the size of the text or the length of the video, but convenience.  If a person is more comfortable to watch videos from the scene of events, rather than read the report, he will choose the video. <br><h3>  Individual offers for the future </h3><br>  Ken Doctor especially believes in individual suggestions for readers.  He believes that even the amount of payment for information the user must choose himself, depending on personal preferences.  Will win the media, which will cease to equal all of one size fits all, and offer an individual content package for a reasonable price.  It is a personal offer that will become a transition point from modern publications to the media of the future. <br><h3>  Media should earn on content, not on advertising </h3><br>  Media must distribute content for a fee.  Then the publication will not be filled with advertising banners and articles that do not pay for the work of journalists and annoy consumers.  End users should form the main media revenue, not advertising budgets. <br><h3>  The information will go directly to the brain. </h3><br>  The doctor is sure that in 50 years the information will be delivered directly to the human brain using biotechnologies and cybernetic capabilities.  Now all the devices from which people receive information are external, and the data is internalized.  In the future, the gap will be eliminated. <br><br><br><h2>  Clay Shirky </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/clay_shirky">Clay shirky</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a4e/6d9/705/a4e6d9705e52382319a542be87e6d2a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Clay Shirky - American writer, teacher, researcher of the effects of the Internet on society. <br><h3>  When the deficit disappears, social change begins. </h3><br>  New ways to convey information step by step eliminated the deficit.  Previously, people did not have enough information, but now it is abundant.  At that moment, when the deficit began to disappear, global social change began.  The more information, the more reasons for dispute.  That is, the more knowledge, the more conflicts.  This is a side effect of expanding the media space. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296520/</a></p>
