Usually we are not engaged in active promotion of beta versions, but this time we decided to make an exception. <br><br>  Today's release of Evernote 2.0 Beta for Mac allows you to <strong>work with shared notebooks right inside the application</strong> and contains our new feature for organizing notes: <strong>sets of notebooks</strong> .  Do not worry, we just started with the version for Mac, but soon these functions will appear in other Evernote clients. <br><br>  <strong>How to install:</strong> To get a beta version, check the ‚ÄúUpgrade to beta versions ...‚Äù option on the ‚ÄúUpdates‚Äù tab in the Evernote for Mac settings, and then manually check for updates.  The installation involves data transfer, so it may take some time depending on the volume of your notes.

    <h3>  Beta Note </h3><br>  Before we get to the new features, a few words about the beta version.  Work on this version is continuing at the present time, and errors are still possible in it.  If you do not want to use the beta version, just wait for the official release, which will be soon. <br><br><h2>  Sharing </h2><br>  Previously, you had to access the web interface in order to open your notebooks for other users.  Now, you can give access to them to your friends and colleagues, as well as view notepads that are made available to you, right in Evernote for Mac, without leaving the application. <br><br><img title="sharing" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db4/e19/c8a/db4e19c8a98fd09664a70b67b176370c.jpg" width="630" height="399"><br><br>  The left pane is now divided into two tabs.  This is the <em>‚ÄúAccount‚Äù</em> tab <em>(Account)</em> , which is associated with your own notes, and <em>‚ÄúShared‚Äù (Shared)</em> , which just allows you to access all of the Evernote collaboration features.  Click on this tab to start working with public notebooks. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img title="sharingpanel" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1be/c7d/43c/1bec7d43c6de4872badb921ee276802c.jpg" width="630" height="381"><br><br><h3>  Opening access to notebooks </h3><br>  Click on <em>‚ÄúManage Sharing‚Äù</em> at the top of the corresponding tab.  You will see a list of your notebooks.  Then click on the ‚ÄúSet up sharing‚Äù button next to the required notebook.  You have a choice: make the notebook completely open to the world, or give access to it only to individuals. <br><br><img title="sharing-notebook" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/520/3b8/79c/5203b879c9580c20c9e956111999fbda.jpg" width="630" height="398"><br><br>  <strong>Public notebooks</strong> <br>  If you choose <em>Share with the World</em> , then Notepad will receive a URL that you just need to tell any person so that he can access the content.  Such notebooks also have corresponding RSS feeds and can be indexed by search engines. <br><br>  <strong>Opening for a limited circle of people</strong> <br>  You can also open notepads for individuals and groups.  In this case, you will need to enter the e-mail addresses of people to whom you would like to send invitations with access to the notebook.  You can also choose to pass authorization to Evernote before viewing the notepad. <br><br>  <strong>Premium feature: co-editing notebooks</strong> <br>  If you are the owner of a <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/intl/ru/premium/">premium account Evernote</a> , then you can allow other users to edit your notebooks.  This is a great opportunity for team collaboration.  And now that all this can be done right in Evernote for Mac, you will have the full feeling that you are working with your own notes. <br><br>  <strong>Premium feature: history notes</strong> <br>  In addition to the previous feature, the beta version for premium users has the ability to access note history for shared notebooks, which allows you to view earlier versions of notes.  This is useful when many people are editing one notebook. <br><br><h3>  Tethered note pads </h3><br>  Notebooks can be linked to your account in two ways.  You can receive the corresponding invitation by e-mail or, having visited any public notebook, click there the button <em>‚ÄúLink to my account‚Äù</em> . <br><br><img title="linktoacct" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8f/89e/e12/a8f89ee128e17d6eea7cc8d3caf68489.jpg" width="630" height="40"><br><br>  Once you attach a notebook to your account, you will always see it in the sharing pane.  When you view a notebook for the first time, notes are synchronized and saved on your computer.  You can specify how often Evernote should check for updates in these linked notebooks, and you can also synchronize them manually by selecting the desired notebooks and clicking on the ‚ÄúSync‚Äù button. <br><br><h2>  Notebook Sets </h2><br>  One of the most frequent topics among the requests and wishes of users is the ability to create nested notebooks.  Whether you use Evernote for work and for privacy, or you just like to create a lot of notebooks - the order in any case will not be superfluous.  We present an excellent solution that will allow you to keep them neat and orderly.  These are sets, such boxes for notebooks.  Lay out all the connected notebooks in the appropriate sets, and then you can watch or fold these sets as necessary. <br><br><img title="stacks" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a5d/9f4/ac9/a5d9f4ac914aaee8f98c25b04bcce1b4.jpg" width="630" height="369"><br><br>  <strong>Creating a set of notebooks</strong> <br>  Make sets easy.  To create a new set, either drag one notebook to another, or click on the notebook with the CMD key held down and select <em>‚ÄúAdd to Stack‚Äù</em> . <br><br>  Grouping by sets is saved only on the current computer, so you can use different sets on all used machines.  So, you can keep open working sets in the office, and personal sets - on your home computer. <br><br><h2>  Recycled Left Panel </h2><br>  In addition to collections and sharing, we also changed the left pane.  Now you can resize and collapse sections of the panel, such as notepads, tags, saved queries and attributes.  To resize sections, drag the headings up and down, respectively.  You can also scroll through the contents within different sections.  Click on the gear icon at the bottom of the left panel to add or remove items on it. <br><br><h3>  When it will appear in other versions of Evernote </h3><br>  We know that you want to immediately see these features in Evernote for Windows and other versions of the service.  The answer will be brief: they are already on the way.  We are working on it.  Stay in touch. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109206/</a></p>
