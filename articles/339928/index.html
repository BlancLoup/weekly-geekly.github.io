Interview with the creator of All-in-One Person</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/63/59df6303d954e975390744.png"><br>  In his channel <a href="https://telegram.me/themarfa">All-in-One Person</a> Konstantin Dokuchaev talks about interesting services and programs that are designed to simplify our lives.  Often publishes discounts on all sorts of cool things, or talks about tricks to set up.  More on this - in an interview with the author. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  How did the All-in-One Person channel appear? </h3><br>  The channel appeared on the basis of my <a href="https://blog.themarfa.name/">site</a> .  It was just autoposting from RSS, first to the bot, and then to the channel. <br><br>  Like a real 90s oldfag, I consume news via RSS, not social media feeds.  Therefore, in the morning I have breakfast and look through the tape during the day, and if I see something suitable for the channel, I prepare a post.  90% of the content I plan is in the morning before work, and posts are published automatically throughout the day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52e/446/3af/52e4463af6e24b26923ccf96ad83384e.png" alt="image">

    <h3>  What content to post, and whether the audience likes 5 posts per day? </h3><br>  The audience with the number of posts can not cope, of course.  This is the main feature of my channel and its problem.  There are about 5 posts per day, and the coverage of one publication reaches approximately 8,000 views, when the channel has more than 23,000 subscribers.  My channel is a directory, and many people read the channel once every few days or less.  Content is clearly structured by tags, and you can always find the desired service or program. <br><br><h3>  Top and worst posts channel </h3><br>  The first post, where I expressed my opinion on the subject of blocking Telegram and advised methods of protection, reproached <a href="https://t.me/russica2">Nezygar</a> , and the <a href="https://t.me/themarfa/3842">post</a> scored a record 60 thousand views: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/209/00a/5e4/20900a5e40789456381a578b2dc57e7f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The <a href="https://t.me/themarfa/4114">second time</a> I decided to joke on this topic.  Apparently, it was too difficult, and about 500 people unsubscribed from me: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff7/984/c1b/ff7984c1b02a35d562a1561d3bd12924.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Does the team need to work with a channel of 20,000 subscribers? </h3><br>  In 99% of cases, everything you see is done by me.  However, I no longer cope with the work on the site and the channel alone, but failed to automate.  Now we are five people, including me. <br><br><ul><li>  My girlfriend makes pictures to attract attention; </li><li>  Ibrahim Salamov writes for me all advertising posts.  By the way, he also has a cool <a href="https://t.me/ibrablogs">channel about medicine</a> ; </li><li>  Another person helps me with posts about iOS and Mac.  If you see a post on this topic, 90% is his doing; </li><li>  There is a freelance editor from the text.ru exchange.  She simply checks the text for the site for errors. </li></ul><br><h2>  How to recruit 20,000 subscribers? </h2><br>  It is easy to get subscribers if you have money and choose the right advertising platforms.  If there is no money, but there is super cool content, then gaining an audience is more difficult.  Still, Telegram is a platform where it‚Äôs difficult to tell a potential audience about yourself without advertising.  Therefore, it is worth financially investing in your channel if you want fast growth. <br><br>  The first audience can be recruited among your friends, then follow the catalogs and small channels of related subjects.  And gradually increase the pace of development. <br><br>  Very well help publications in the media (paid and not).  You should not hope for free publications if your channel has a techno theme or some other narrow one.  About you will not be told at every corner, if your topic is not HYIP and you are not the primary source. <br><br><h3>  How to choose an advertising platform? <br></h3><br>  Selecting channels for promotion is a very difficult task.  And now it becomes even more difficult than before.  This year, the Telegram was noticed by the owners of the public from VKontakte.  If earlier there was a problem not to get on the ‚ÄúUzbek‚Äù channel (the audience of these channels is poorly monetized), to run into bots, now you still need to bypass the public clones.  Their owners are engaged in copying content from public books, books or from somewhere else.  They buy traffic indiscriminately and a couple of weeks go to the top. <br><br>  Author channels with proven content as it was a little, and remains.  Some of them have only a few thousand subscribers.  And to find such channels is often difficult. <br><br>  Many channels that are in the top, artificially wound by various methods.  And to distinguish such channels can only be based on their experience and knowledge of the internal cuisine Telegram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/076/2de/d69/0762ded6975cc67c4a71cfbe82487c0d.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  ‚ÄúThe promotion takes from 50 to 100 thousand rubles a month‚Äù </h3><br>  At first, this amount was divided into dozens of sites.  Now almost the entire amount goes to two or three ads.  Accordingly, the return from these sites is expected to be higher. <br><br>  The cost of the subscriber is highly dependent on the subject of your channel and the quality of the audience you want to attract.  More recently, the subscriber I was getting 10-15 rubles.  But in the major channels of subscribers attract more difficult.  And now I am guided by 20-30 rubles. <br><br>  Other channel expenses are editing.  About 10 thousand more per week. <br><br>  Services for working on content, domain, hosting, etc. are technical needs.  Another 5-10 thousand a year. <br><br><h3>  How to promote Telegram channel for free? </h3><br>  Many authors have no money for promotion.  Therefore, there is such a thing as mutual PR.  When two channels talk about each other for free.  In the same way, I scored the bulk of my audience.  When a steady income from advertising appeared, it became easier for me to buy a post on the site. <br><br><h3>  Tools for working with telegram channels </h3><br>  To work on the channel, I use several tools: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://app.kuku.io/%3Ftype%3Daffiliate%26affiliate%3Dthemarfa%26ref%3Dthemarfa">KUKU.io</a> - for autoposting and viewing the content of the plan; </li><li>  <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> for organizing work on advertising and advertising content; </li><li>  <a href="https://tgstat.ru/">Telegram Analytics</a> for analytics. </li><li>  Google Analytics </li></ul><br>  I can‚Äôt be friends with bots.  Even popular bots often do not work or make ‚Äúmissteps‚Äù.  For example, the popular Controller bot often publishes posts not during or immediately in a pack. <br><br>  The site helps me to understand who my audience is.  Telegram doesn‚Äôt have analytics tools other than Google Forms or questionnaire bots.  But subscribers are reading my site, and I know everything about them, thanks to Google Analytics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/109/94d/9cb/10994d9cb518026686449c7c82ccd8cc.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  How much does the All-in-one Person channel cost? </h3><br>  The cost of the channel you want and the price you can really get are two different numbers.  I like the following formula for calculating the cost of the channel: advertising revenue for the year + mark-up for the brand. <br><br>  It does not matter the number of subscribers in the channel, if the channel has no income.  But when buying a channel, it will be difficult to keep the bar of income, as the author did.  If my channel is bought, I do not think that it will be able to be conducted as I do.  Consequently, with advertising will be trouble. <br><br>  Based on the formula above, I am ready to listen to an offer to sell the channel with a figure of two million rubles (here you can pick up a calculator and count the income). <br><br><h3>  Findings: <br></h3><br><ul><li>  You will not be told about your channel ‚Äúat every corner‚Äù if your topic is not hyip and you are not the primary source. </li><li>  It is easy to get subscribers if you have money and choose the right advertising platforms. </li><li>  Many top channels are wound, and it is difficult to understand them without experience. </li><li>  Free channel promotion is possible with the help of mutual PR and reposts of large channels. </li><li>  Telegram tools: KUKU.io (autoposting), Telegram Analytics, Trello (organization of work) </li><li>  The cost of the channel can be calculated by the formula: advertising revenue for the year + mark-up for the brand. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339928/</a></p>
