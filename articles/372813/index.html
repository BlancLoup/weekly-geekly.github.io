      This, perhaps, few people remembered, but the Powerbook, one of the most recognizable and important products in the entire history of Apple, turned 25 this week.  So the time to show the updated version of the Macbook Pro was chosen just perfect. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>It took 1 year for Powerbook to complete the tasks that the new MacBook Pro performs in 5 seconds.</b> </blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d8/a6e/b06/9d8a6eb066224c06b0bf19d66300fe10.jpg"><br>  The importance of a new professional laptop for the company is underlined by the fact that no other device was shown yesterday.  No One More Thing - a complete presentation for one specific product.  Except for the modest announcement of the new application for Apple TV, all attention was paid to only Macbook Pro.  <b>And to see, in fact, was what.</b> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Touch bar</font> </h2><br>  Let's start with the main thing.  In fact, Apple officially said goodbye to the top row of function keys.  Thereby, that habitually settles down at the very top of almost any keyboard. <br><br>  According to <i>Phil Schiller</i> , Apple‚Äôs marketing guru, these buttons have been on computer keyboards for over 45 years, so it's time to replace them with something more modern.  Fortunately, the transition to this ‚Äúsomething more modern‚Äù was not as painful as the abandonment of the 3.5-mm headphone jack in favor of Lightning in the iPhone 7. The f-keys were replaced by a small touch screen under the touch bar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/295/51f/b07/29551fb07f464f2f8666f7390c840ea6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>In fact, this is an additional Retina-display, the contents of which radically change depending on the running program.</b>  <b>The options for using it are incredibly many, it all depends on how and in what you work.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Launched Safari - the Bookbar menu will immediately appear in the Touch Bar;  moved to the page of the site - you will see there the button "back" and the search box.  This should be very convenient: it is much easier to quickly touch the desired button with a finger than to reach for it with the cursor.  And so on: we look through the photos in ‚ÄúPhotos‚Äù - available filters are displayed on the Touch Bar, which can be applied to the image with one touch, and tools for formatting the image.  But if the longing for the f-buttons is too strong, you can still call them on the Touch Bar by holding down the Fn key. <br><br>  The Touch Bar works both in Xcode and Terminal, what developers should like. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff8300">More information about Touch Bar ‚ûú</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cea/8a7/efd/cea8a7efd6b54951b620636b53ae59ca.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Software</font> </h2><br>  Apple understands that the target audience of the Macbook Pro works primarily for its laptop, so the presentation presented new versions of two popular professional programs: the installation Final Cut and everyone's favorite Photoshop.  Both logically received full support for the Touch Bar. <br><br>  In Final Cut, when you install the video, an additional panel displays the timeline video, and you can move along it with a simple swipe with your finger, like in some iMovie for iPhone.  In the same place, if you moved to the section on working with sound, you can raise and lower the track volume.  The same habitual movement. <br><br>  In Photoshop, the new functionality seems to be implemented even better.  Swipe can change the size of the brush, as well as choose the desired color from the scale.  An impressive number of shortcuts will be available on the Touch Bar: for example, a hot key for adding files to a project or a separate submenu for layers.  All this without the need to crawl the mouse over the mat.  In addition, in one tap, you can call the history of all changes to the images and, if desired, quickly return to the desired stage.  The updated version of Photoshop promise to release before the end of the year. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4BkskUE8_hA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Hardware acceleration</font> </h2><br>  On the Touch Bar, the changes in the Macbook Pro do not end, the laptop has been significantly improved both inside and outside. <br><br>  Version, as usual, two: 15 and 13 inches.  Both have become much thinner than their predecessors (by 17% and 14%, respectively).  Thickness 15 '- 15.5 millimeters, weight - 1.8 kilograms.  The Trenadzatidjuymovaya version is even more portable - 14.9 millimeters in thickness and weighs only 1.3 kilograms. <br><br>  The Macbook Pro trackpad doubled at once, but Force Touch, simulating a click vibration, is in place.  But the keyboard is now completely different and made on technology Butterfly.  It debuted for the first time in a twelve-inch MacBook ultrabook and features a very small keystroke.  However, Schiller said that the updated Butterfly model was installed in the Pro versions, so it should be more convenient to print on it. <br><br>  The power button now houses the Touch ID fingerprint scanner.  No more passwords: put your finger on the sensor and the system lets us inside.  No less convenient, and switching between users: Macbook determines which of the owners touched the scanner and accordingly changes the account on the fly. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cbf/ab6/b37/cbfab6b379814c0e833e112be7eb0e8f.jpg" alt="image" width="600"></div><br>  If you believe Apple, then the new ‚Äúfirmware‚Äù is set to ‚Äúthe best display among all Macs‚Äù.  It is 67% brighter, 67% more contrast and displays 25% more colors than the previous model.  And of course, the MacBook Pro is the most powerful MacBook today.  Inside the ‚Äútop‚Äù fifteen-inch version: Intel Core i7 on the Skylake architecture (up to 2.9 GHz), 16 GB of RAM with a frequency of 2133 GHz, Radeon Pro 460 4 GB and SSD up to two terabytes with a throughput of 3.1 GB give me a sec.  Schiller promises that, in practice, graphics processing speed has increased by 130%, and gaming performance ‚Äî by 60%. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://find.qwintry.com/ru/posts/macbookpro2016%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3Dblog_article_ma%25D1%2581book%26utm_campaign%3Dautumn16"><font color="#ff8300">New MacBook Pro in numbers ‚ûú</font></a> </h4><br>  The 13-inch version is a bit more modest, but still impressive: the same i5 or i7 processors have the same fast SSD, but instead of the Radeon chip, the graphics from Intel iris.  As a result, we have a 103% increase in games and 76% in video and graphics. <br><br>  But the ports are not so clear.  Farewell to the usual USB, hello new Thunderbolt 3. There are four of them here, and since the connectors use a USB-C connector, this means that each of them can be used both for charging and as HDMI, VGA, Display Port-connectors.  There would be adapters. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b92/776/70d/b9277670d0454a1898a84f52b78b651f.jpg"><br>  The thirteen-inch Macbook has a stripped down and more accessible version.  Two ports, no Touch Bar, but the laptop is still thinner than the Air (more than two millimeters), with which it will compete within its own ecosystem.  And new Macbooks began to sound louder and more efficiently cool. <br><br>  The new Macbook Pros are good for almost everyone and can definitely be called some of the most interesting laptops of today.  Perhaps they have only one minus - a huge price.  In Russia, the starting model of the thirteen-inch version without a touchscreen, but immediately with 256 GB on board, costs from 120 thousand rubles (in the US - $ 500 cheaper).  Fifteen inches, of course, more expensive - from 190 thousand. <br><br>  It‚Äôs not a bad idea to save money when ordering in the USA, as in the case of the <a href="http://find.qwintry.com/ru/posts/apple-iphone7-zakazat-v-ssha%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3Dblog_article_ma%25D1%2581book%26utm_campaign%3Dautumn16">iPhone 7</a> , because of the customs duty (+ 30% to the cost of goods exceeding 1000 euros) is no longer possible.  In the delivery and <a href="http://find.qwintry.com/ru/posts/shopping-help-free%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3Dblog_article_ma%25D1%2581book%26utm_campaign%3Dautumn16">purchase of</a> less expensive gadgets (at reasonable prices in the USA and Europe), the <a href="http://qwintry.com/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3Dblog_article_ma%25D1%2581book%26utm_campaign%3Dautumn16">Banderolk</a> will always help you: speed of delivery, ease of ordering and reliability have always been our main advantages.  <b>And if there is no difference, why pay more?</b> <br><br> <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/user/register%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3Dblog_article_ma%25D1%2581book%26utm_campaign%3Dautumn16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b08/1f7/02d/b081f702d699411cbfd09b649e7f4258.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372813/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372813/</a></p>
