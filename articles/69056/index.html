Low wages, meager pensions, the possibility of losing even the work that brings at least a small but steady income.  Unfortunate prospects.  Here and there we meet people who could earn a living, but they do it either in the old manner, at the micro level, or simply do not know how to optimize the process. <br><br>  And then there's the crisis!  Many people found themselves in unpleasant life situations, what can we say.  And on the other hand, together more fun, and the trouble does not matter!  You can learn from each other. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Question: take 10 dollars.  Can you double this amount?  What period?

      At one time, if I were asked such a question, I would answer that there would be enough week.  As a student, I sometimes bought phones from friends or ads, played with them, then sold them.  Some want to sell faster, lower the price, in another device a scratch.  Bought for 10 ye, sold for 20 ye.  Entrepreneurs and businessmen are sometimes called ‚Äúbarges‚Äù, sticking a negative connotation to business activities.  I disagree with such a question.  As Napoleon Hill said, when setting goals, the principle should be clearly stated that both parties to the transaction should cooperate on mutually beneficial terms.  You can not make a state of trouble or deception of others.  And I totally agree with that.  You can be an honest entrepreneur. <br><br>  So here.  We doubled $ 10, we got $ 20.  Let's double them.  It‚Äôs a paradox, but making a double with a small amount is much easier than with a large one.  But this is just an illustration. <br><br>  There are people who are able to create something with their own hands: knit, cut out from wood, weave from a rod, etc.  Often we see them near the roads with their creations.  And someone writes beautiful poems or makes amazing photos ... How to make your hobby a profession, how to provide yourself with means of livelihood?  And here will help the community of people, different people, who can tell people how to make money on a particular product online. <br><br>  Firstly, you need to teach people to set goals, secondly, to support them in confidence in their abilities, and thirdly, to suggest marketing techniques and methods of achievement that someone might not think of.  It is important that the person himself wants to achieve financial independence and take concrete steps.  And let the audience watch and draw conclusions, help, analyze mistakes, etc. <br><br>  Shl.  Add to the post: I often have to talk with people on the topic of earning money.  Almost everyone thinks that you cannot earn money on your favorite business!  You can earn only as an accountant, economist or lawyer :) And I have to convince people that this is not so. <br>  Ask: And how can I earn, if I like to photograph?  I explain that if you like a photo, you need <br>  become a pro in this, study literature, click off a lot of cadres, learn to feel the moment, etc.  This is a job and it will take a lot of time.  But she will be in pleasure.  Then you need a really good camera, SLR, additional equipment.  then we can shoot weddings, celebrations, we can post work on photo resources on the Internet.  that is, to purposefully go to the goal, which many do not even have.  There is a vague desire to ‚Äúhave a lot of money‚Äù, but there are no goals and deadlines for implementation. <br><br>  Well, and so on.  that is, the resource will be sharpened for such educational work. <br><br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69056/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69056/</a></p>
