    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  There were many problems, including problems with providers that blocked communication.  A lot of work was done, the development lasted for almost a year.  But we managed to solve all the issues, and the site was launched 11/11/11. <br><br><h5>  "And what, Skype is no longer rolling?" </h5><br>  Many people ask this question without understanding the essence of the site.  It lies in the fact that completely unfamiliar people can communicate and meet people on the site, which is problematic with Skype.  On speakplace, you can choose from the list of an <b>already</b> existing conference, go there and join in the conversation with people whom you have never heard or knew before.  Or create your own conference <s>with blackjack and whores</s> and wait until someone comes to you. <br><br><h5>  Diversity </h5><br>  Also on the site there is a function of closed conference.  When you create a conference, you can specify a password to enter, and now only those who know this password will be able to enter it. <br><br>  Some will use the site to practice foreign languages, someone will play for people on the guitar, someone will read their poems and, in general, you can use speakplace in absolutely different ways. <br><br>  The main thing is that the site requires only a computer with a microphone and the Internet at normal speed.  There is no need to install any third-party programs or anything else, all communication takes place on the site itself. <br>  Registration was made as simple as possible to take no more than 30 seconds.  It is also possible to log in through the account "Vkontakte".  With this authorization, everyone will be able to see your page when you talk in the conference (under your name there will be a link). <br><br><h5>  Now the dark side </h5><br>  You think, ‚Äúyeah, as always, trolls and freaks will yell into the microphone, making it difficult for everyone ..‚Äù <br>  In this case, we have provided the microphone mute function of any of the conference participants.  You can always just turn off the person who somehow interferes with the conversation. <br>  You can turn off your own microphone. <br><br>  There are also people who create incredible echoes.  This is because, due to the small delay caused by the not very high speed of the Internet or some other factors, the sound coming out of the speakers goes back into the microphone and the echo and very large interferences are obtained in a cyclical manner.  Therefore, in order to avoid this, it is <u>necessary to</u> use <b>headphones</b> .  Otherwise, because of such people, the project may simply go to the bottom, because  they will disturb everyone. <br><br>  That's basically it.  A small review of the resource is over.  Now I am ready to answer your questions and take note of suggestions / comments / advice. <br>  If there are any flaws or imperfections on the site (and they are, because it has just opened), then please describe them in the comments - we'll fix everything. <br><br>  You can also watch a small, up-to-date video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjGBERvCjUk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjnRnBMds2Nf-1J7HUThgt9o81oKQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PS This is just the beginning, and soon the worldwide version in English will appear under the domain speakplace.org, new functions will be added and existing ones will be improved. <br><br>  And we can only hope that the site will withstand the famous habraeffekt, take its own place in the world wide web for centuries and will be useful to people :) <br><br>  PPS The topic was written by the founder of speakplace, but the owner of this account is not the creator of this startup.  The topic was moved from another blocked account to this one.  Thank you for understanding. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133402/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133402/</a></p>
