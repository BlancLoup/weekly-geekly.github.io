  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Down with the language barrier - 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For those who do not know: this topic is an <b>unscheduled</b> continuation of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/45147/">this article</a> .  Why unplanned?  Yes, because I thought at first that everything would end on the publication of a muddy idea, but when people began to discuss, I realized that the first time I was not very easily able to explain the essence of the idea. <br><br>  Of course, I tried to explain everything in the comments, but this method was not very effective.  Therefore, now I want to give answers to the questions that some Hablu people were most excited about. <br><br><h4>  First of all </h4><br>  Some wrote in the comments that such services already exist, and as examples provided <a href="http://www.livemocha.com/">links</a> , <a href="http://www.perevodby.ru/">links</a> , <a href="http://www.perevedem.ru/">links</a> ... But I did not find anything similar.  You didn‚Äôt catch the main thing - in none of the projects you mentioned the transfers <b>are transparent to the client</b> .  This is the main difference.  In your examples, I have to go in and order a translation.  I described the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa service in which the <b>user does not need to do anything on purpose</b> .

      Well, imagine, you go to Mail or Yandex mail as usual and in the most standard way send a letter ... to a Japanese who knows only his native language.  And you should not care what path this letter will make.  The main thing is that you sent it in Russian, and he will receive it in Japanese.  And the answer you will again receive in Russian.  And all because mail <b>Yandex or mail works with this system.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Or, suppose Habr began to work with this system. <a name="habracut"></a>  Then all posts are translated into all languages, and comments too.  Imagine, you discuss in the comments the output of the iPhone, with people from different countries.  Americans argue with you, here the Chinese are connected and say that they have already sold an iPhone for 10 years.  And all this happens in the comments, and you read it and write in Russian, but everyone understands you))). <br><br>  <b>Once again:</b> I described the service, not the site.  This service can be integrated anywhere.  In existing blogs, in dating sites, in e-mail, in the media - it does not matter. <br><br><h4>  Secondly </h4><br>  What surprised me personally was comments like: <blockquote>  <i>if people really really want</i> <i><br></i>  <i>a) talk on a common topic in which both are whipped,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>b) understand each other</i> <i><br></i>  <i>then they need either a rudimentary knowledge of English, or an automatic translator like google translate / promt / some other.</i> </blockquote><br>  This is in my opinion a strange logic.  You can also say - if you really want to, you can walk on one leg.  And cut off the second.  Well, you know, there are bicycles, there is a metro, but this does not mean that there should not be a taxi.  If you really want to, then you can walk.  But if I am ready to give 300 rubles and go by taxi, what is surprising here.  It's easier, faster and more convenient. <br><br><h4>  Thirdly </h4><br>  Today I received several more answers from the translation bureau.  It remains to wait a couple more.  If they do not answer this weekend, I will assume that they have ignored it.  By Monday I will describe what the translation bureau answered. <br><br>  By the way, looking ahead, I will say that some bureaus are very active in insisting on meeting, in general, they are very, very willing to cooperate.  In this regard, the question is: is <b>there anyone ready to take up the implementation or how to continue this topic</b> (except for those who have already unsubscribed to me in a personal)?  If yes, then write, I will drop one of you the contacts of these bureaus.  Meet, discuss ... some it turns out to <b>sponsor, even ready</b> .  However, on Monday I will write more in detail. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> How it ended, read the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/45694/">next part</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45208/</a></p>
