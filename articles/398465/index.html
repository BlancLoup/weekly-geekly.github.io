Which companies repair their products regardless of geography?  And is it possible to save on this? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The bulk of the producers divide and rule.  For each market - its own modification, or even a model.  It is so easy to refuse repair to a buyer from another country who has decided to save when buying in a more developed market.  It is logical - everyone is trying to cut off the unwanted import of "gray" goods, which may have a much lower cost.  Otherwise, it makes no sense to keep a lot of certified sellers and pay additional fees to the treasury of a state. <br><br><h3>  Warranty as a guarantee of the possibility of repair </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8f/c66/f34/c8fc66f3423140b78f02d3a711e045f8.png">

      As practice shows, in the absence of an official service, it is often easier to throw the device away than to fix it.  Chinese smartphones are an example of this (by the way, this is why Chinese laptops have not yet spread).  And what about the desired laptops, smartphones, tablets and other electronics, if you need a model that is not sold in Russia or costs twice as much as abroad? <br><br>  Warranty service for such devices is valid only in the country for which the device was manufactured.  It is assumed that it will be exploited.  Naive, but very useful for the company.  But there is another side to the coin - what if the gadget breaks down when leaving the country of operation?  It is very unpleasant if during a business trip a broken gadget cannot be repaired. <br><br>  Some companies still condescend to the buyer, providing the so-called "international guarantee".  Such obligations of the manufacturer allow repairing the purchased device in another country.  There are few of them (manufacturers), and each has additional conditions - but this attitude to customers is pleasant.  A good reason to choose a product with such support. <br><br><h3>  Standard limitations of international warranty </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ee/a5a/817/2eea5a817e02473c90f03f9bd9726c97.png"><br><br>  The total set of warranty obligations does not change, i.e.  Warranty covers devices: <br><br>  1) having a completed warranty card and a purchase receipt (best of all, if it is a regular cashier's check, not a PayPal screenshot - the payment address is important); <br>  2) the absence of mechanical damage; <br>  3) no traces of intensive use in improper conditions; <br>  4) the absence of traces of intensive operation from the fact that the device for home use worked as an industrial; <br>  5) no signs of damage caused by improper operation; <br>  6) no trace of violations of the described rules of work with the gadget. <br><br>  In addition, even with an international guarantee, each manufacturer can put forward additional requirements.  Some companies require to transfer a guarantee from one country to another, as if putting the device on the account in a particular region.  Others offer to use the free services of service centers for certain categories of goods. <br><br><h3>  International Warranty Companies </h3><br>  LIST IS NOT FULL, UPDATED <br><br>  <b>Acer</b> - laptops - <a href="http://www.acer.com/worldwide/support/itw.htm">warranty service possible with International Traveler Warrancy</a> <br>  <b>Apple</b> - everything except smartphones - <a href="https://support.apple.com/ru-ru">unlimited warranty</a> <br>  <b>ASUS</b> - <a href="https://www.asus.com/ru/support/article/606">laptops</a> - unlimited warranty <br>  <b>Sony</b> - cameras, laptops - <a href="https://www.sony.ru/support">unlimited warranty</a> <br>  <b>Dell</b> - laptops - full warranty, possible failures in cases where the necessary components are not in the country where the repair is being made (they will offer to supply the <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D42:22778">same</a> ) <br>  <b>HP</b> - laptops - according to unconfirmed data, unlimited <a href="http://www8.hp.com/ru/ru/support/warranty/index.html">warranty</a> for purchases in the European Region <br>  <b>Lenovo</b> - laptops - <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/ru/ru/services-overview/">warranty</a> is only available on models officially sold in the country where repairs will be made <br>  <b>Samsung</b> - <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ru/support/skp/faq/445959">laptops</a> , cameras - unlimited warranty <br>  <b>Toshiba</b> - laptops - <a href="http://www.toshiba.eu/generic/ASP_SUPPORT/">unlimited warranty</a> <br><br><h2>  Replenish.

Try to clarify?  I would like to collect in one place the largest number of reviews about repairs in Russia and the CIS equipment from abroad, and a full list of companies with an international guarantee, and the conditions for its provision. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398465/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398465/</a></p>
