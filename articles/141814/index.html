  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Starting a new set of Yandex Data Analysis School</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, April 10, the next, already the sixth, set in the Yandex Data Analysis School started.  This year, both the deadlines and the rules for admission to the School have changed a little, and we want to tell about all the changes in more detail. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/babenkoartem/view/507355/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d5/8ab/66c/8d58ab66cb519b4389d0b96dc78744e5.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <strong>1. Department "Data Analysis" and "Computer science" in Moscow</strong> <br>  In previous years, admission to these departments was two-stage: online correspondence testing and in-person interviews with teachers of the School. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Initially, the correspondence test was not difficult - for example, only 15% of candidates did not pass the test last year and more than 600 people were admitted to the interview!  It is clear that it is becoming more and more difficult for the School administration to devote several hours to each candidate. <br><br>  This year, for admission to the interview, it is necessary to solve the tasks of the full-time written exam.  Both testing, and exam, and interview are conducted within <a href="http://download.yandex.ru/company/schad_programm.pdf">our program in mathematics and programming</a> . <br><br>  Anyone can fill out the questionnaire and take an online test right now on our <a href="http://shad.yandex.ru/matriculation/mathematics/">website</a> , the correspondence stage will run until May 20 inclusive. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Two to three dates will be set for the written exam from May 21 to June 10, and each candidate will be able to choose a suitable day for himself. <br><br>  If the applicant successfully passes the written exam, we will individually agree with him about the time of the face-to-face interview.  Interviews will be held until July 10 inclusive. <br><br>  <strong>2. omputer Science Center in St. Petersburg</strong> <br>  As in Moscow, the set now consists of three stages: a written exam was added, the same for all areas.  <a href="http://compscicenter.ru/application">Applications</a> are accepted until June 15, preliminary dates for written examinations: April 14, May 19, June 20.  All interviews are supposed to be held until June 30. <br><br>  Applications are now accepted only from students not younger than the second year.  For junior students it is very difficult to combine training in the center and in their own university. <br><br>  <strong>3. Regional offices "Data Analysis" and "Computer science"</strong> <br>  The procedure for admission to the branches differs from the Moscow one only in that the written examinations in the branches will be held later in the second half of June. <br><br>  Thus, written exams will be held in Moscow and St. Petersburg, as well as in Kiev and Minsk.  Those planning to study in absentia will need to come to a written exam in one of these cities. <br><br>  <strong>4. Department of Bioinformatics in Moscow</strong> <br>  Last year, students in the department of bioinformatics received students of both mathematical and biological specialties.  Now we have divided the applicants: in one year we will recruit only mathematicians, in the other - only biologists. <br><br>  Only mathematics students can enter this department set.  Admission will continue to consist of correspondence testing and interviews with the heads of the department, there will be no written exam.  Questionnaire and test you will find on <a href="http://shad.yandex.ru/matriculation/bioinformatics-math/">this page</a> . <br><br>  <strong>5. Cooperation with the magistracy of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University</strong> <br>  For several years, there have been joint magistracies of the School with the <a href="">Moscow Institute of Physics</a> and <a href="">Technology</a> and the <a href="">Higher School of Economics</a> .  This year a new coordinated program of the School and the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University appears. <br><br>  Read more about it <a href="">on our website</a> .  To participate in the program, you must independently enter both the School and the <a href="http://master.math.msu.ru/">Computer Algebra</a> specialty of the <a href="http://master.math.msu.ru/">magistracy of mekhmat</a> .  For students of this program will be drawn up an individual curriculum.  All non-resident students are provided with a hostel.  More information about the program will be discussed at <a href="http://master.math.msu.ru/">the open door of the magistracy of mekhmat</a> . <br><br>  All questions about the School please send to: <a href="">yaschool@yandex-team.ru</a> <br><br>  <em><strong>ShAD Administration</strong></em> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e3b/803/3d4/e3b8033d40645412d3153283aa07c75c.gif" width="1" alt="."></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141814/</a></p>
