The story of the partial success in the field of management from a beginner. <br><br>  It so happened that I started working as a coder not so long ago.  Grew up smoothly.  First I wrote a toy for myself in the army, then I participated in the development of an advertising platform and its subsequent correspondence, then I retrained as a PHP coder.  And, suddenly, unexpectedly became unexpectedly Se√±or.  Immediately the question arose how to encourage people to work.  And not anyhow, but that the task was completed on time and as needed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Working as a coder, and then a developer (forgive me, I distinguish these concepts), I somehow did not think about how and what I was doing.  How often I put to work, how often laziness, etc.  But (strange !!!) the work was done on time. <br><br>  And then senor, and even given the load beginner.  And I went, I did not have time, because  it is necessary to make your own and adjust the employee, and show what to do and how.  For some reason I immediately remembered that I was looking for information by and large (all sorts of examples, algorithms, considerations), and when the forces were already running out, already more or less prepared, I came to the boss and asked for help.

      With my ward somehow did not work out, an attempt to send to resources, where (for me) everything was chewed, did not lead to anything.  According to the employee: "Well, I find it faster and easier for you to ask than to climb somewhere."  Then, due to illness, I left the company and after a long time got a job in a fairly large company as a developer. <br><br>  Enough quickly grew to the Senora (if it was not okay) and then they made me Manager.  Mindful of the old video materials from Microsoft Manager (I don‚Äôt remember my name and I don‚Äôt remember the link) and how bad it is, I decided to try it all the same.  Moreover, in our company only beginners did not want to be managers.  And again, face to face, I was faced with the problem of encouraging employees. <br><br>  In general, the problem was simple.  I am a very soft person at first glance, I can explain simple things to the limit, and so on.  Actually all my subordinates used it, there were exceptions of course, but these exceptions were on the strength of 10% of all subordinates. <br><br>  Okay, how can it happen, so let's go.  The carrot and stick method did not work.  The reduction of premiums and the attempt to restore authority did not lead to anything, because  it turned out that of all the resources I had only 10% (see above) NOT beginners.  The rest were from the category ‚ÄúI do not see what to write,‚Äù i.e.  not at all. <br><br>  Okay, I didn‚Äôt cope with this attack and successfully retired from the company, there was no point in continuing to work. <br><br>  I decided to start everything from scratch, I got a job with another company right away, and decided to start with the fact that I was a strict boss. <br>  Do you think it turned out?  not!!!  Nothing has changed at all.  That's when I thought about, how ?? <br><br>  After a lot of advice from my friends, my wife (all of them were managers anyway), I came to the conclusion that I did everything right.  Then the question arose, what is wrong? <br><br>  Like praise, scolding, running - knocking out awards, if worthy and so on. <br><br>  It turned out all easy.  Anyway, we measure each person on our own.  Having got used to work quickly and in a short time, I applied the same work to my subordinates.  For me it was news that part of the code, which explained how to do it and gave all the materials, i.e.  sit down, read and write according to examples, it may take 5 times longer than for yourself.  Actually, the decision ‚Ññ1 to increase the time and not to drive people into a very narrow time frame.  * Who was the manager or he is, knows how time is counted, if not you set the deadline, but the customer *.  Actually it helped, but not for long, and it helped on the strength of% by 20. <br><br>  And then I decided to make an experiment.  I called it a seniority week.  The idea is to make one of the subordinates the chief of the team for a week and patronage is transferred every week along the chain.  This means - plans, reports, questions - all to the eldest, even if he is a novice.  Naturally, without insanity, I mean, the programming guru will not go to the newcomer to consult how he can do, for example, an image detector.  Although there were attempts :-) Actually, here is the solution number 2, let the employee feel what responsibility is. <br><br>  The method helped and productivity increased by 40%, I even began to receive plans and reports regularly and on time. <br><br>  Further, while the experiment was going on, I decided to create an atmosphere of necessity in the team.  In large companies, and sometimes in small ones there is a very strong shortcoming.  The company forgets about employees, the chefs can greet, they can be interested in personal affairs, they can drink with subordinates, but they don‚Äôt touch on such a problem as ‚Äúwhat the employee needs‚Äù.  And I decided to monitor the attitude of my employees to myself, to the older one, to work in general. <br><br>  It is precisely this interest that allowed us to identify shortcomings in the team in the form: ‚ÄúYou set too little time for complex tasks‚Äù or ‚ÄúI cannot read an example and do it right away, I must first read, comprehend, and then read and do‚Äù.  Actually, I got an exhaustive picture of where to go, so that I had a pro team.  Here is the solution number 3, you need to be interested in the interests (sorry for taftology) of the worker.  And at once I will make a reservation that the questionnaires will not help, you need to communicate personally. <br><br>  Actually, at the moment I still have one unresolved problem, namely: How to motivate a person who worked well, but began to work poorly.  The problem is that I personally know that a person is a novice programmer, he has the makings of it, can work like an ox, i.e.  Dismiss is not an option and I want to get out of the vicious circle and solve this problem. <br><br>  Actually summary of the general flood: <br><ol><li>  Do not compare subordinates and colleagues on your own; you can work faster, ‚Äúbe taller and stronger‚Äù.  But your worker needs not work from morning till night, but normal work.  And who wants to work a lot themselves will come to you or will do something else themselves </li><li>  Do not be afraid to do adequate experiments, for example, for 2 weeks of experiments, a barrel cannot be tipped over a spoonful of honey, or if you want to, but it prickly, then fully control the process.  In my case, seniority played into the hands, people began to understand what responsibility is. </li><li>  Learn to be interested in what people want at work, what people do not really like, based on the statistics of the work of this person.  Do not forget about the staff, not in general, but about each individual.  This can be achieved using familiar methods, such as: interchange the order of personal reporting (but be sure to tell everyone who will report and when);  if the worker mows, explain to him what exactly he is wrong and explain how to act, what to do and why exactly </li></ol><br><br>  Of course, all that is said is true only for adequate workers.  If you are not human and brazenly ‚Äúspit in your face‚Äù, then the employee should be explained what will happen to him.  Moreover, his colleagues will help you with this. <br>  And this opus is far from perfect, since I myself am just a beginner.  Therefore, any comments on the unresolved issue will be extremely useful. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> moved to the blog "Learn to work" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81266/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81266/</a></p>
