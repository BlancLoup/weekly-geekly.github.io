      This is March, and the serfs are happy to serve.  At first, I gave hope to our conference.  But not simple - but fabulous - threw the network. <br><br>  The catch was great. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With such a broad output, Russian and then world news agencies are becoming the flagship in the list of PR channels. <br><br>  <b>Work on the press (analysis of the components of the PR campaign of the Bear)</b> <br><br>  His achievement of the Index Mr. Medvedev again overcome in early March 2007.  His team achieves this with two actions: an Internet conference and a speech in front of the press and publishers. <br><br>  During the first, Dmitry A. Medvedev answers questions posed by Internet users (March 5).  Here, in particular, it denotes one of the priority areas of "attracting investment", raising the problem of licensed software in Russia.  PR Medvedev addressed his speech to Internet audiences not only in form, but also in content - he joked about ‚ÄúOlbansky‚Äù <sup><b>3</b></sup> , praised open source software, promised support for computer classes in schools, and even told about ‚Äúfidonet‚Äù, the last remark so absurd that it was replicated many times.  The rest of the content of the conference should, as one would expect, tightly packed information about what ‚Äúnational projects‚Äù are, with special emphasis on health care. <br><br>  Then, two days later, he is already directing attention to journalists, opening the second inter-sectoral conference ‚ÄúMass media, book publishing, printing: the results of 2006 and development prospects‚Äù.  Here he makes some more populist statements that work perfectly, allowing the Index to overcome the 1000 bar. In particular, the following statements influenced the rating: ‚ÄúIn matters of advertising, it is necessary to continue the search for a‚Äú reasonable balance ‚Äùbetween business and audience interests‚Äù, ‚Äúduring the transition digital broadcasting is necessary to maintain the level of analog broadcasting, so that citizens do not lose the opportunity to watch those TV channels that are watching now ‚Äùand‚Äú For the first time, we have exceeded the 100-thousand mark of titles (released  books) and entered the top four leading book powers of the world, along with Britain, China and the United States. " <br><br>  In principle, as a pr-hack, Medvedev is decomposed into fairly clear components, which are reflected in the Index by the growing popularity. <br><br>  It is interesting, but after these statements, the Medvedev team achieved Index growth - then the whole year is only decreasing.  At the beginning of December, it is slightly over 300. But on December 11, Dmitry Medvedev meets with the candidates of the parties who nominate him for the presidency of the Russian Federation, and the Index shoots off the bar at 2600. It is amusing that this time the source of activity is not at all news agencies, like in the previous models, and the central Russian newspapers.  Agencies will regain their primacy in January, reporting more on Medvedev more and more often than all the press, television, radio and Internet media combined. <br><br>  Even the actual nomination for president of such a furore no longer produces.  Nonetheless, as can be seen in the illustration, Medvedev becomes the most mentioned candidate among presidential candidates, being nominated for presidency, comparing himself with Putin. <br><br>  _________________ <br><blockquote>  <sup><b>1</b></sup> First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev published an article in the Kommersant newspaper devoted to the first results of national projects.  Focusing on the significance of national projects, Medvedev pointed out that the very fact of their appearance means that Russia was able to become another country. <br>  In particular, one of the results of national projects is an increase in the social optimism rating: for example, from October 2005 to October 2006, the number of citizens who believe that they will live worse in the future, for the first time in recent years, has decreased to 12 percent, and the number of optimists has become stable exceed 30 percent.  Since 1998, the country's leadership has been able to solve the most acute problems of ensuring security and national sovereignty, the foreign policy position has been strengthened, internal political stability has been achieved, the macroeconomic situation has improved significantly and resources for development have appeared.  In 2006, society and the authorities were mainly concerned with not the stabilization tasks, but the development tasks. <br>  According to Medvedev, work on national projects will bring, and is already bringing, a wide variety of positive results.  It is already noticeable that thanks to them the whole country came into motion: the regions, feeling the support of the center, are becoming more and more involved in the work.  ‚ÄúIf before the points of social development were in a small number of regions, now the whole country is involved in the priority national projects,‚Äù Medvedev stressed. <br>  ( <a href="http://www.lenta.ru/news/2007/01/25/medvedev/">Source</a> ) <br><br>  <sup><b>2</b></sup> January 25, 2007.  Yesterday, the State Duma discussed the implementation of national projects in Russia.  To report on the progress of work on these projects, First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev arrived in the State Duma.  Three federal ministers at once came to his aid ‚Äî A. Gordeyev, agriculture, L. Reiman‚Äôs communications, and V. Yakovlev, regional development.  And two unpopular ministers - M. Zurabov and A. Fursenko - preferred once again not to annoy the deputies and sent deputies instead of themselves.  ( <a href="http://www.km.ru/magazin/view.asp%3Fid%3D6042C83876B3427782951BC947D0AE1E%2520">Source</a> ) <br><br>  <sup><b>3</b></sup> ‚ÄúI think that now this citizen [an American who was taught‚Äú Albanian ‚Äù], like an Englishman, at least, speaks Russian and, perhaps, learns Albanian.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMedvedev noted that the existence of a specific Russian language on the Internet must be considered, since this language is existing, living and developing,‚Äù the media reported on the results of the conference. <br><br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20552/</a></p>
