Sometimes dreams come true!  Zhenya ( <a href="https://habr.com/users/phillennium/" class="user_link">phillennium</a> ) and I got caught almost the most important developer of Maven - Robert Scholte.  And that's what we asked him ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xz/2s/gt/xz2sgtm3ee3uthvfjrdggtfirxy.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/424505">Read more ‚Üí</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><a name="anchor"></a><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8b/ty/dg/8btydgh2vufljuqgh7yxgves9g8.jpeg">  <font color="#606060">With the new release cycle, Java versions come out one after another, the eleventh one has already appeared, while many are sitting on the eighth.</font>  <font color="#606060">You will soon make a <a href="https://jokerconf.com/2018/talks/ciamjmk7uwqwyseuy6iao/">report</a> on how Maven supports all this, and you do not want to spoil the report, but ask the question this way.</font>  <font color="#606060">What do you personally think about this new release cycle that adds work to you?</font>  <font color="#606060">Is this a change for the better or for the worse?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  If you're talking about a 6-month release cycle, then for Maven it's a bit quick.  Our team is quite small, we have about 5-10 active participants, and they are all volunteers, no company develops Maven.  So, everyone should work on the project in his spare time.  Changes in Java create a lot of work.  Every time a new version comes out, we need to provide its support, which means that we don‚Äôt have time for Maven, plug-ins for it or anything else.  It would be better for me if the cycle were a year or a year and a half long. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8b/ty/dg/8btydgh2vufljuqgh7yxgves9g8.jpeg">  <font color="#606060">Do other people developing projects for the Java ecosystem have a similar feeling and also need to provide support for newer versions?</font>

I joined the project about 8 years ago, that is, during version 3.0.3 or 3.0.4.  And at this moment Maven existed for quite a long time.  As far as I know, he was part of the Turbine project.  From the part of this project a separate instrument was made, which became Maven.  I, like, probably, all, enjoyed then Ant.  I didn‚Äôt like that every time I started working on a new project, I had to copy all these Ant-files.  I knew that there should be a better solution, I began to search for it on the Internet and found Maven.  True, before I understood the main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMaven, a lot of time passed.  However, when you understand it, it becomes convenient.  All the problems I had with Ant disappeared.  Ant is still an excellent tool, but if you are working on a project that combines multiple sources, I strongly recommend Maven or a similar tool. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">Maven is just about Java.</font>  <font color="#606060">I tried to use it for C ++, but it was not very nice.</font>  <font color="#606060">Will there be a time when Java will be no more, and what will we do then?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  Of the existing popular object-oriented languages, Java seems to be one of the oldest, more than 20 years old.  I did not watch the latest statistics, but I am sure that Java is still very widespread.  I think it will exist for quite some time.  At least, I hope so - this means that I will not be without work. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">Will Maven live for a long time too?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  But this is a difficult question.  Until today, 65-80% of Java projects use Maven.  Even for a product that is over 15 years old, that's a lot.  Perhaps there is still much room for improvement in Maven.  We have ideas for Maven 4 and even Maven 5. But it takes a long time to implement them.  I think Maven‚Äôs overall design will not become obsolete, but other assembly systems may well overtake it.  Because they derive experience from both the mistakes we made at Maven and the decisions we made correctly, and based on this experience, we can start from scratch.  One of the advantages of Maven is backward compatibility.  Even a project written 10 or 15 years ago can be built with the latest version of Maven.  But because of this, we have a lot of old code in Maven Core.  It should be replaced, but not so easy to do. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">As I recall, you can still now collect mods without annotations.</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  Yes it is possible. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">Before the interview, I tried to find a tutorial about it, and did not find anything.</font>  <font color="#606060">It is as if the langolera are chasing us and eating up all the old documents on the Internet.</font>  <font color="#606060">But I remember that once a long time ago there were no annotations and special conventions were used.</font>  <font color="#606060">Well, let's move on to another question.</font>  <font color="#606060">Do you think Maven has real competition?</font>  <font color="#606060">Say gradle?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  Gradle is a very strong competitor, and it has existed for quite some time.  I believe that the presence of competition is good, because it keeps us in shape and makes us see some alternative solutions.  They just have a different approach to how to build projects, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.  Everyone should choose what best suits their project.  Perhaps I should also mention <a href="https://github.com/forax/pro">pro here</a> .  This is a tool written by Remi Forax from the ASM (Bytecode Parser) command.  He, like me, was a member of the Jigsaw expert group.  He wanted to write a build tool that would best reflect the ideas of Java.  When creating a pro, he borrowed the best aspects of Maven.  Watching this was interesting.  It was a demo created to show that you can use Java 9 modules and related advantages in the builder. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">You said that you participated in the Jigsaw project - and you said it in the past tense.</font>  <font color="#606060">Has it ceased to exist?</font>  <font color="#606060">Does he still have the opportunity to develop?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  This JSR is closed.  True, there were some unresolved problems, but they are now engaged in the support team. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">What caused the most difficulty when developing Maven?</font>  <font color="#606060">What problems were the most serious?</font>  <font color="#606060">Not in terms of Java 9, but in general, based on the entire experience of development.</font>  <font color="#606060">Can you choose, say, the two most important problems?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  The question is not easy, but let's try.  The part where dependency resolution occurs is extremely complex.  We are still trying to improve it.  You may have noticed that there was no version of Maven 3.4, after version 3.3.9 there was immediately 3.5.0.  The main reason for this is that there have been significant changes in dependency resolution.  They were labeled as bugfixes, but we noticed that a significant number of projects were suddenly broken - they depended on these strange changes.  It was unacceptable.  Therefore, we did what we would not have undertaken under any other circumstances ‚Äî a hard-reset git repository, and in Maven 3.5.0 we began to select only external improvements.  Well, and, of course, we made the console multi-colored - everyone liked it. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">Ok, now turn the second difficulties!</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  It was not easy for us to find a connection with the Maven community and teach them how to use the tool properly. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">So everyone knows how to use Maven: copy a few XML spools from comments on Stack Overflow, and it will work.</font>  <font color="#606060">Is not it so?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  Oh well.  Not.  I am sure that most often you will be advised to do a clean install, and this is not true.  So, probably, should be done in Maven 2. Now you need to perform mvn verify.  Because when you run clean, you delete everything, the whole result of the work.  And if your files are being copied - these are I / O operations, they are performed slowly.  In general, many things will be performed many extra times.  Most plugins know when they need to perform their task.  As a rule, there is no need for clean.  As for install, this command only copies your JAR files to the local repository.  This, again, is an unnecessary input / output operation.  Moreover, your local repository may become dirty - that is, it may look different than your colleague's local repository.  Sometimes this can lead to interesting results.  So you just need to do mvn verify, that's enough. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">By the way, I have now opened <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">maven.apache.org</a> , and it says: "Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool."</font>  <font color="#606060">But many believe that Maven is just another build tool.</font>  <font color="#606060">What is the difference between a build tool and a project management tool?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  It‚Äôs probably better not to answer this question to me ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt write it on the site.  I think the author wanted to say that Maven is much more than just a project build.  He also deals with resolving dependencies, he provides the format of the configuration, he allows not to install too many things.  In general, this is a huge set of everything. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">What are the basic principles and beliefs of the Maven team?</font>  <font color="#606060">For example, do they consider that the declarative approach is better than the imperative one?</font>  <font color="#606060">Something like Python Zen.</font>  <font color="#606060">Do you have a similar set of rules?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  I think no.  In our opinion, the configuration of plug-ins should be made as simple as possible.  If reasonable defaults exist, they should be specified.  This makes life easier for the end user.  For the first time in many years, we recently changed the default option for the source and target versions - it used to be 1.5, now it's 1.6.  We wanted the default option to be present, because without it, the version used in the JDK is used.  In this case, if I use Java 10, and someone else - Java 12, we will have different results.  You should always specify source and target.  But if you started using Java 9, you will not be able to create Hello World with a simple pom file and one class, since Java 9 requires at least Java 6 for the source and target values.  Therefore, we decided to make the default version 1.6 and added a warning that if you have not yet specified the version, you should do this - people should know that you need to set either the source and target versions or the release value if you are working with Java 9. Or both that, and another simultaneously. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">What difficulties do you see for Maven in the future?</font>  <font color="#606060">You said you were trying not to change Maven too often.</font>  <font color="#606060">And yet, what awaits us in the future?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  One of the most significant changes we want to make concerns the pom file.  We found that in some sections ‚Äî especially in a build ‚Äî it would be nice to add some additional elements.  But so far we can not do this.  The same pom file that you use on your system is downloaded.  If you add other elements to it, they break the XSD, and other tools cannot use it. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">But you can change the XSD in the title?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  Yes.  But I don't think every tool checks for XSD.  They just think they are dealing with version 4.0.0.  So it will be very difficult to make changes.  We decided to split the pom file into several parts, and start with Build POM.  And the one that will be unloaded will be called Consumer POM.  It will be generated based on the Build POM and no further action is required.  And it will be fully compatible with Maven POM 4.0.0.  By dividing the POM into two parts, we can finally improve it significantly and make Maven easier to use.  This is a change in the Maven core, and we have been working on it for more than a year, including implementation in the IDE.  It is not simple. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">Some IDEs attempt to include parts of Maven in the IDE for reasons of integration, autocompletion, incremental compilation, and so on.</font>  <font color="#606060">How to do it right?</font>  <font color="#606060">As far as I remember, some parts of Maven were built into Eclipse a long time ago.</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  I think that such attempts are quite justified - this system turned out to be very user-friendly due to integration.  This was possible thanks to one of the major changes implemented in Maven 3. In it, the architecture was redone to provide better support in the IDE.  The authors of these changes worked closely with Eclipse, and this is where the decision came from.  I think it is permissible.  I know that NetBeans and InelliJ have a completely different approach, they just call Maven from the command line without any integration. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">Another important topic is the speed of Maven.</font>  <font color="#606060">Can we somehow increase it?</font>  <font color="#606060">Dependency resolution and I / O operations are very slow.</font>  <font color="#606060">Even today on SSD.</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  Yes, something can be done.  First you need to see how many cores are in your system, and run Maven in several threads.  This is one of the solutions.  You should also take a look at Takari.  This is a company created by Jason van Sile, one of the founders of Maven.  He wrote some interesting extensions and significantly improved support for parallel builds, i.e. when you are building several projects.  I hope that someday he will give these ideas to Maven, but for now you should look at his page. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">You said you were working on Maven in your free time, right?</font>  <font color="#606060">Does the fact that you are one of the creators of Maven help you in your current job?</font>  <font color="#606060">Or is it just a hobby?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  I work as a software architect in a government organization in Holland.  With this, I make a living.  Of course, they know that I also work on Maven, so they periodically contact me with questions about Maven.  But overall, I'm just their architect.  And in the evenings I work on Maven, trying to improve it, help people. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">Do you work on other open source projects besides Maven?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  I participate in two other projects.  One is called MojoHaus, it has developed a significant portion of plug-ins for Maven.  True, I‚Äôm doing little now in this project, but I still sometimes go there and edit various trifles.  Another project is called QDox.  It parses the source code.  It is also associated with Maven, as it is used in some plugins for it.  This experience helps me because, for example, in the case of the module descriptor, which appeared in Java 9, the experience allowed us to use the handle in Maven plugins. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">By the way, what is your opinion on Java 9, 10, 11?</font>  <font color="#606060">Should I use them or is it better to stay on Java 8?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  Should move to newer versions.  Even if you don‚Äôt use all the features, go to Java 10, or wait a few weeks and go to Java 11. Just use the classpath.  Java has become much faster thanks to modularity, but the classpath just works.  I know that many people still think that you need to add a module descriptor or use a system of modules, but this is not necessary.  Just use the classpath. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">By the way, are you familiar with the GraalVM project?</font>  <font color="#606060">How about using it to build Maven?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  Last week I visited JavaZone and discussed this with Chris and Oleg.  I think we will need to spend some time with this, see if it is possible to really improve the performance of Maven with the help of GraalVM.  It may be interesting. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">You are the creator of Maven, a project that is very important to Java developers.</font>  <font color="#606060">What are your feelings about this?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  I am not the founder of the project, I support it.  I began to study them when he had already walked a considerable path, and it seems like I am getting it acceptable.  Ten years ago I would not have thought that I would end up at the top of the hierarchy, but it happened, and this is very cool.  Everyone has an opinion about Maven, and I really like that when you come to conferences, people come up and say that they are delighted with Maven.  It motivates me a lot, and gives me the strength to continue working on the project when I return home. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8b/ty/dg/8btydgh2vufljuqgh7yxgves9g8.jpeg">  <font color="#606060">Many developers vehemently hate XML.</font>  <font color="#606060">I don‚Äôt belong to their number, but when it comes to build systems, this theme always comes up in connection with pom.xml in Maven.</font>  <font color="#606060">So I want to know: what is your opinion about XML?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  In XML, it's good that it is clear to everyone, it is easy to parse and for it you can provide very good support in the IDE.  I'm quite normal with XML, and as far as I know, among Maven users, no more than 5% hate XML - but they shout about it all the way!  And the other 95% you just never hear.  However, for these 5% there is a solution - here again I want to mention Takari.  There is a polyglot project that allows you to choose a different syntax.  So if you want to use Yaml and pom.yml, this is quite possible.  You just need to add extensions to the project, and you can switch to another language. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8b/ty/dg/8btydgh2vufljuqgh7yxgves9g8.jpeg">  <font color="#606060">And about the mood of the developers: I remember the <a href="http://maven.40175.n5.nabble.com/Publish-Maven-releases-on-SDKMAN-td5906366.html">thread</a> in the Maven mailing list, where the author of the SDKMAN tool!</font>  <font color="#606060">to the proposal to distribute the Maven community through it with phrases like ‚Äúeverything I see is a project with a stupid name‚Äù and ‚Äúyou could better sell your idea‚Äù.</font>  <font color="#606060">Then discussions arose: some thought that the community had reacted too aggressively, others that the original proposal ‚Äúdo additional actions in connection with my tool‚Äù was unreasonable.</font>  <font color="#606060">Anyway, many were unhappy with the situation, and in this regard, the question is: do you think that specifically Maven, or in general, does the open-end community have communication problems?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  Communication can be very, very difficult, that's for sure.  Especially when it happens only through the text and you do not see the interlocutor in front of you - in this situation it becomes difficult to explain what you want to say.  I think that before every open-source project there is this problem of correct communication with people.  I fully understand why the project participants sometimes get annoyed - they hear the same questions over and over again.  An example of such a question that I have already mentioned is ‚Äúwhy can't mvn clean install be used‚Äù?  I stopped explaining this, because otherwise I would have become a rude myself, but I do not want to.  So I explain these things in other ways.  So, on the one hand, communicating can be very difficult.  On the other hand, although Maven is inflexible, it is part of his success.  When people come up with suggestions that are incompatible with our concept of Maven, we simply say: sorry, but this does not suit us for such and such reasons.  I fully understand that this may be disappointing.  But in general, this approach is only for the best. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  <font color="#606060">Could you, at the end, say a few words to our readers, suggest how they can come to a bright future?</font> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/gz/t_/6kgzt_slb8okkrs8aijy7jq_ccg.jpeg">  As I said before, a small team is working on Maven, this is an open-source project in which everyone can participate.  It is not so difficult.  We created a new label called up for grabs.  These are problems that should not be too difficult to fix.  Thus, it is quite possible to get acquainted with how Maven works.  If you want to join our team, then by the example of your fixes we will see the quality of your code - if you want to be noticed by us, then I recommend trying it.  I would very much like our team to grow in the future. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><p><img width="96" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8b/ty/dg/8btydgh2vufljuqgh7yxgves9g8.jpeg">  Thanks for answers.
