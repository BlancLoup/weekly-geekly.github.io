  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The biggest scandal in the history of online poker</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the most famous online poker rooms on the Internet, <a href="http://absolutepoker.com/">Absolute Poker, is found</a> guilty of fraud.  One hundred percent proof appeared that some users in the poker room (including the administration) have ‚Äúsuper rights‚Äù and can see the cards of all the players at the table.  These features <a href="http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/showflat.php%3FCat%3D0%26Board%3Dbeats%26Number%3D12541923%26page%3D0%26fpart%3D1">are used for dishonest purposes</a> . <br><br>  At one of the recent tournaments, the winner was the player under the nickname Potripper, who simply fantastically beat his rivals, without missing almost a single hand.  He only discarded when his opponent had the best hand.  If the opponent had nothing, then Potripper was always successfully bluffing and taking the bank (see the video below). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Player Marco, who finished second in the tournament, became suspicious and, at the end of the event, requested the history of all hands at the poker room.  And then the unexpected happened.  Whether due to an oversight, or for some other reason, the poker room sent the XLS file not just with the handout history, but with full decoding of each player's cards, and even with additional information, such as the IP addresses of all players and ID - their registration numbers. <br><br>  An analysis of this file does not give rise to doubt that there has been a fraud.  Potripper clearly saw the cards of other players, otherwise some distributions just lose all meaning.  All hands are generated on video, so you can see this.

For example, for this, he called a big pot, having 23 without a pair.  In other words, he even theoretically had no chance of winning this bank.  Otherwise, as a deliberate discharge of chips it can not be explained. <br><br>  An analysis of the aforementioned XLS file showed that Potripper's extraordinary abilities appeared immediately after the ‚Äúobserver‚Äù with ID = 363 appeared in the second minute of the tournament.  Up to this point, Potripper played two hands and both folded before the flop.  For the entire subsequent tournament, he did this only once, when a player was sitting next to him with an overpair of kings (this is on video) <br><br>  Subsequently, ID = 363 followed Potripper through all the rooms until the end of the tournament.  It must be said that in the poker room the ID is assigned by registration date, that is, ID = 363 is clearly close to the administration.  Later it turned out, ID = 363 has the same IP address as ID = 10, and ID = 10 credentials indicate the home cable modem of the former president of Absolute Poker (his name is Scott Tom).  The Potripper account is owned by another former employee of the company (his name is AJ Green).  By the way, this is Scott Tom's best friend. <br><br>  In fact, the scam is revealed to one hundred percent.  It is very strange that the Absolute Poker room has not yet officially acknowledged the fact of fraud, but still continues to investigate. <br><br>  So, in the poker rooms there are ‚Äúsuper users‚Äù who have much higher rights than regular players.  And although these ‚Äúsupermen‚Äù have no right to sit down at the table, but they have many friends. <br><br>  Losing poker players often complain about their fate, the dishonest random number generator and the poker room fraud.  Up to this point, their complaints were perceived as nagging losers, but now it takes a completely different turn.  Without a doubt, the current scandal has become the largest in the history of online poker and it is very much undermines the credibility of all online poker rooms, not just Absolute Poker. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15175/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15175/</a></p>
