      <b>Abbyy Lingvo X3 review (mobile version on memory cards)</b> <br><br>  To begin with, we note that there are no innovations in the program itself.  Everything is similar to the boxed product for mobile devices, which was previously released on a CD.  All the innovations are reduced to the fact that the manufacturer placed this program on a memory card, which, according to its microSD standard, is suitable for Nokia, Samsung, and LG smartphones, plus all the communicators on Wndows Mobile present on the market.  The only "but" - the version of the operating system WM translator does not recognize everything.  This vendor, however, mentions on the back of the package.  There are no other weighty points requiring attention in the business card of the new product. <br><br>  <b>Packaging, product appearance</b> <br><br>  By packaging design manufacturer approached quite entertaining.  The box in which the product is delivered can be characterized as compact, but at the same time, one on which the body easily fits all the necessary information about the product, company, class, etc. Here we ask to forgive us for some pun, but by visual contact with the packaging of other impressions did not happen. <br><br>  Plastic packaging transparent.  As we managed to find out, it closes simply enough - the manufacturer simply solders it, on the principle of any other USB flash drive.  To get directly to the product itself, you need to slightly cut the edge of the package.  There is simply no other way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/624/b48/de6/624b48de6c0ca5798aaf3913471bfee3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/193/3a4/503/1933a4503e3095521efceccd5685198c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main packaging design is just a double-sided paper insert located all over the package body.  A large amount of information, corporate logos of the company, the main features of the product, etc. are made on it. Here, the vendor did not forget about such ‚Äútrifles‚Äù as the data on the system requirements for smartphones and communicators - without this data, the procedure for starting to use this product significantly would be complicated. <br><br>  Around the middle of the package you can see a small white transparent box in which the memory card itself is located, as well as two adapters.  All three types of products are, of course, branded, although essentially speaking whether this was a necessity, the question is open. <br><br>  <b>Installing on a Symbian OS smartphone</b> <br><br>  Directly on the memory card itself contains a fairly large amount of data, the main array of which are dictionaries.  They, along with some auxiliary files, as well as installation programs, occupy about 500 megabytes.  Considering the fact that the capacity of the card itself is two gigabytes, a quarter of the space reserved for this program is, in principle, an acceptable option, since we still have about 1.5 GB for other needs. <br><br>  During the procedure of inserting a memory card into the expansion slot, the smartphone's OS automatically detects that some programs are installed on the media and recommends installing them through the File Manager application.  However, we are happy to note that we installed the program, which is said, directly, launching the installation file from the memory card.  The whole procedure of installation and configuration took us about 5 minutes. <br><br>  The procedure for installing this application on the communicator is the same in time, although the installation file is different.  Well, yes it is natural! <br><br>  We wrote about all the main points of working with the program in another review, and therefore there is no point in repeating.  Moments from working on a Symbian smartphone are similar. <br><br>  <b>Some conclusions</b> <br><br>  Will there be a demand for a new product?  It is best to answer this question by counting the money spent on the purchase of new items.  The cost of the full boxed version is about 240 hryvnia.  A lot or not, a moot point.  On the one hand, the price for a memory card of two gigabytes ranges around 100 hryvnia.  On the other hand, the dictionary itself costs about 60, so a priori there is a question: ‚ÄúFor what to pay an additional 80 hryvnia?‚Äù  The answer, in my opinion, is quite simple - for simplicity and convenience.  No matter what anyone says, a memory card is a device that is much smaller in size than a disk and much easier to install than installing from a disk.  By the way, the installation procedure of the program from the disk can be found here. <br><br>  In addition, if we add to the above the question of mobility, speed of installation and simple uninstallation, the question of the difference of 80 hryvnia does not seem so difficult. <br><br>  <b>Advantages and disadvantages</b> <br><br>  <b>+</b> <br>  Cute package design <br>  Easy installation <br>  Easy navigation through the program interface <br>  Affordable price <br><br>  <b>-</b> <br>  Not found <br><br>  Estimated price: 240 hryvnia <br><br>  <a href="http://itnews.com.ua/reviews/292.html">ITnews.com.ua</a> <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79117/</a></p>
