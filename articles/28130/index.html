I think many will be interested to read.  Recommend! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <em><strong>Donald Trump</strong> is the largest developer of New York (many of the city‚Äôs skyscrapers are his business), the owner of a number of clubs, golf courses, a casino, a large beauty contest among women them), the leading American reality show about the business (in Russia there is an analogue - "Candidate").</em>  <em>The man, who at one time had a debt of 9.5 billion dollars, but managed to get out of the pit.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Donald Trump can be treated differently.</em>  <em>Someone considers him an excellent entrepreneur, someone a man who knows how to raise the hype around his own name, and Jack Trout generally quite openly once criticized Trump.</em>  <em>Well, Jack, I think at first it would be nice if you could earn as much from your positioning as Donald earns from real estate.</em>  <em>Regardless of how you feel about Trump, you can hardly deny the success of a person with almost $ 3 billion.</em>

      <strong>For starters I quote his most famous statements:</strong> <br><ul><li>  For billionaires, work and pleasure are one and the same. </li><li>  Never take a vacation.  Why do you need it?  If the work is not fun, then you are not working where needed.  And I, even playing golf, continue to do business. </li><li>  I never wanted anyone who does not want to work in my company to work for me;  you should do the same: do not stay where you don‚Äôt like. </li><li>  I go to bed at one in the morning, and at five in the morning I wake up and start reading fresh newspapers.  I do not need a longer rest, and this gives me a competitive advantage. </li><li>  A good investor is like a diligent student.  Every day I spend hours reading the financial press. </li><li>  In business, it is better to be cocky, even cheeky, than tough and intractable. </li><li>  Hold modestly, disarmingly, downplay your merits and achievements.  Save your cruelty and the ability to be formidable when it is really necessary. </li><li>  Always try to understand the reason for your anger: sometimes it is completely justified and even necessary for business, but sometimes it serves only as an indicator of your misunderstanding of the situation. </li><li>  For me, wealth is a tool to achieve clearly defined goals. </li><li>  Do not charge your children with the heavy burden of undeserved wealth: this can ‚Äúparalyze‚Äù them, discourage them from working hard and achieve their own success in life. </li><li>  When buying any product or service, do not hesitate to bargain, seeking for yourself more favorable conditions.  I think pride, which prevents you from saving your own money, is a great folly. </li><li>  I'm sure you need to spend as much as you think fit.  But I also believe that you can not spend more than you can. </li><li>  I think that the inability to give tips of adequate size is a sure sign of a loser. </li><li>  Relate to making every decision reverently, like a lover. </li><li>  Always remember one simple rule: dress for the job you want to have, not for the job you have. </li><li>  Look in a mirror more often: you should be proud of what is reflected in it.  If you look untidy, so will your business. </li><li>  It is believed that I achieved great success only thanks to the talent of the promoter, although in fact the opposite is true - I achieved success, and this is what brought me some fame. </li><li>  Real billionaires never seek to rush time, because life is a very good thing, but, unfortunately, very short. </li><li>  Life has given me a very important lesson: the one who once betrayed, in a difficult moment, will change you again. </li><li>  The second most important event in the life of every man is the day when he buys a yacht, and the greatest event in his life is the day he sells it. </li><li>  A player is someone who sits all day and night in front of the slot machines.  I prefer to own them. </li><li>  Concluding another deal, I never forget the worst possible option and whether I can survive it.  Do not think about the positive outcome of the transaction - good can take care of itself. </li><li>  The worst thing a businessman can do when turning a deal is to let his partners feel how much he wants it. </li><li>  There is nothing more criminal for financial well-being than to come up with a great idea and not bother to implement it. </li><li>  You can not deceive the public.  At least, you can not do this for a long time. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Below are links for mandatory reading:</strong> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.biztimes.ru/index.php%3Fartid%3D499">Donald Trump's success story</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.biztimes.ru/index.php%3Fartid%3D374">Donald Trump's Ideas 1</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.biztimes.ru/index.php%3Fartid%3D379">Donald Trump's Ideas 2</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.biztimes.ru/index.php%3Fartid%3D416">Donald Trump's Ideas 3</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.biztimes.ru/index.php%3Fartid%3D502">Donald Trump's Ideas 4</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.biztimes.ru/index.php%3Fartid%3D363">10 tips from Donald Trump on how to speak to an audience</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28130/</a></p>
