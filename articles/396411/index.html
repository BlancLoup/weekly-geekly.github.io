Much has been done, now the company has a large number of plans for the development of its products.  Some of Blizzard Entertainment‚Äôs actions didn‚Äôt look too good.  It is about closing the Nostalrius Begins fan server, the company achieved its disconnection no matter what.  Of course, many fans of games from Blizzard did not like it.  The Nostalrius team was going to upload the source code and the player base to the network to give WoW fans the opportunity to continue working on the project.  But then this decision <a href="https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D2%26amp%3Bt%3D44031">was reversed</a> . <br><br>  But now there is another game - StarCraft Universe.  StarCraft II fans created it, and now <a href="http://www.upheavalarts.com/"><em>StarCraft Universe</em></a> is available in beta.  According to the developers, this is a ‚Äúthird-person action game with World of Warcraft RPG elements, Diablo fighting mechanism and FTL starship physics with a number of StarCraft elements‚Äù.  The most interesting thing is that Blizzard has nothing against this game.  At least for now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The history of StarCraft Universe began in 2011, when a group of modders, led by Ryan Winsen, announced the creation of a mod for StarCraft II.  The mod turned a real-time strategy in MMO, into a kind of World of Warcraft with a number of features.  The developers called this mod World of StarCraft.  But Blizzard didn‚Äôt like it all, and after only a few hours, videos were removed from YouTube, where the process of passing the game was demonstrated.  In the world of igrostroy, the noise was raised, and the developer of League of Legends, the company Riot even offered Winzen a <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/107126-World-of-StarCraft-Modder-Gets-a-Job-Offer">vacancy in a studio</a> .

Blizzard invited the modder to the studio, and he himself launched a fundraising campaign on Kickstarter, which successfully reached the target level, and even exceeded it, collecting $ 84,000. <br><br>  And now the game is out in beta.  The release of the final version will be held in August, and the developers plan to raise some more money for Indiegogo.  This time the funds are collected to support the game and its servers.  Winsen himself cannot sell the game for obvious reasons - it is considered a non-commercial fan product, and the sale of copies of the toy will violate the copyright rights of Blizzard. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/L7pVSqfCFps%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhYNH8d5mfTYZIy82jArCBn3snziA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In order to start the game, you need to have StarCraft II installed on your computer.  The installed free trial version of Starter Edition is also suitable.  After that, you need to download and install the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/zeez7cw">mod from here</a> .  It is completely free - you do not need to pay anything for the installation or for the subscription. <br><br>  In the open beta version there are only 4 missions, of which 3 are educational.  The fourth mission called SC Universe: Beyond Koprulu player immersed in the world of alternate reality StarCraft.  Here Raynor does not save S. Kerrigan, and the main heroes of the fashion are the protoss, who were almost completely destroyed by zerg hybrids.  Only the last representatives of this civilization remain, continuing to fight for their existence. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396411/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396411/</a></p>
