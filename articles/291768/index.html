Now I want to talk about a system that allows you to calculate: <br><ul><li>  How many people have passed by, without going to the store; </li><li>  How many went back; </li><li>  How much does an average customer spend time in a store and not only ... </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/647/d07/6b5/647d076b5dff457ab3d70ae4a9b0d045.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The principle of the system is very simple - WiFi.  Now many people have smartphones with a WiFi module.  If it is on, requests to search for networks are constantly being broadcast.  It does not matter if you are connected to any network or not.  Requests go constantly.  The request contains a lot of information, including the unique MAC address of the device. <br><br>  Here is an example of what the standard debian utility airdump can catch: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d20/10c/cdf/d2010ccdf0024562bde97a3c73e9d22b.png">

      Knowing only the MAC address of the device and the signal strength, you can learn a lot about the buyer: <br><ul><li>  Did a person walk past a store or go inside; </li><li>  If the area is large, then by installing several sensors it is possible to assess how a person moves between departments; </li><li>  How often this customer goes to this store; </li><li>  What is the average time a customer spends in a store; </li><li>  What other stores of this network does this customer go to; </li><li>  The number of regular customers is increasing or decreasing. </li></ul><br>  Moreover, at least one of the providers of such solutions makes it possible to get a ‚Äúportrait of the buyer‚Äù.  If a person is in the sensor's area of ‚Äã‚Äãoperation, then you are provided with information in what other stores / cafes / restaurants this person was (provided that these stores / cafes / restaurants have a system from the same supplier).  What will allow to make targeted promotions with specific shops / cafes / restaurants.  Knowing where your potential buyers dine, you can do cross-industry with specific institutions on the basis of accurate data.  And after the campaign there is an opportunity to evaluate it in numbers. <br><br>  A bit of technical information about a possible implementation method. <br><br>  A TP-LINK consumer router (TL-MR3020 or equivalent) is used as a sensor.  It is installed OpenWRT firmware with an additional software module that is designed specifically for collecting statistics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2c/091/bf2/c2c091bf2e6945ccb052e6a7efaf4347.png"><br><br>  One of the routers acts as the main one, the rest as auxiliary ones.  A complete wired network with access points is being built, or a mesh network, where only power is supplied to the slave access points.  The main point is contacted by radio.  This scheme allows you to reduce the cost of the whole complex, using cheaper and less efficient routers as auxiliary (only for collecting statistics) and the main router for its initial processing. <br><br>  Mesh network reduces installation costs (no need to pull a separate cable to each point, just power it from the outlet). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/342/80a/ec0/34280aec0faf4166a8aadb247a6cd386.png"><br><br>  The cost of equipment is very small, so even small cafes can afford such a system. <br><br>  As a plus, on the basis of this equipment, you can make hotspot and distribute the Internet to visitors.  When setting up an authorization for a social network account, you will almost know by name a part of your audience, which will give even more space for targeted advertising. <br><br>  And a couple of words about the scalability of a specific solution: it is possible to install a bluetooth module in the router and monitor the bluetooth device.  Given the growth of the wearable electronics market, this will allow to reach more visitors. <br><br>  In conclusion, retail is increasingly studying its customers, using the most modern technology.  The main thing is that he was able to stop in time and not go over that fine line when marketing research turns into total surveillance. <br><br>  PSV is ready to share some details of the implementation of such a system in our retail network. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291768/</a></p>
