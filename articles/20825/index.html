  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rational reason for buying a commercial content management system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The only reasonable, rational argument in favor of buying a commercial content management system is the desire to get quick results for little money.  The basic functionality and the availability of a library of standard design templates will allow you to realize your plans with almost no losses!  Everything else is a pure bluff of marketing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Affordable cost</b> . <br>  Typically, the cost of the basic version is at the mark of $ 100.  The amount is really not big, but the overwhelming majority are buying a system with a functional "margin" (and therefore more expensive), hoping to actively develop their project!  By the way, marketers are well aware of this and are building a pricing policy in such a way that it is much more attractive to buy a little more expensive but with more opportunities than to buy some modules later.  In real life, as a rule, half of the stated capabilities of the system are not used. <br><br>  <b>Regular free system update.</b> <br>  If you update only news on the site, a headache with updates is not needed at all. <br><br>  For customers who are actively developing their project updates are required much more often than they go from the official supplier.  And there are cases that the required patches are ‚Äúplanned only in the next release,‚Äù which, by the way, will not be free.  In such cases, it is easier to fix everything yourself.

      <b>Developer independence</b> <br>  As long as you have enough features of the basic version, you are really independent of the developer, but as soon as you outgrow it, you fall into the ‚Äúbondage‚Äù, like all the others. <br><br>  Any more or less serious project in the process of operation requires tuning, optimization, adaptation to the solution of specific tasks of the company.  And very often, such an adapted product outgrows the parent in many ways, and changes in the code reach a critical mass at which an update to the ‚Äúnew improved version‚Äù simply kills the project created over the years.  And now try to find an adequate specialist or company that will agree to bring your project inexpensively, without having crippled it? <br><br>  There are more real life examples!  Remember the well-known accounting program, there the principle of "independent developer" is implemented at 100%.  But for all that, there are entire support departments for large companies, hundreds of companies and thousands of free-lance programmers, and all are not bad at living.  And such a thing as ‚Äúdevelopment and implementation of specialized configurations‚Äù has become a separate direction in the accounting software industry. <br><br>  I am neither a supporter nor an adversary of commercial control systems.  The text appeared as a result, from time to time arising disputes in <a href="http://svoedelo.livejournal.com/">my blog</a> .  This suggests that the efforts of marketers are not in vain :), and often people just do not see and do not take into account other options, but this does not mean that they do not exist at all? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20825/</a></p>
