We will discuss the problem of lack of user answers to specific questions of developers and offer a solution for iOS. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Description of the problem </h4><br>  Perhaps someone from the developers will find a familiar story, when you decide on a new feature, you implement it, send the application to the AppStore, it is approved by the evil censors, you open the application and ... silence.  In this case, you can have a lot of users.  No, of course, if the application will fall through time, there will be no silence.  But if everything works, then silence is almost guaranteed.  Only occasionally, as an easy pleasant breeze, can skip comments containing a mention of this feature.

      Silence can upset and demotivate developers.  And sometimes it is not easy to understand whether everything is good with features.  Of course, it is possible to draw some conclusions about using it or not, without user feedback, it is enough to have any simple mobile analytics.  But will it reveal the difficulties that your users have encountered?  What little things need polishing?  Understanding these nuances can be very difficult. <br><br><h4>  What to do? </h4><br>  It is possible and necessary to move in two directions: to use mobile analytics more intensively, enter and analyze different indicators, and try to get feedback from users, as well as answers to interesting questions.  The most popular and at the same time simple way to get feedback is to make the button for sending a message to the developers and hope that the user will find it when he needs it.  Yes, "find", it is usually hidden, because  Nobody wants to clutter the UI because of this functionality. <br>  And now let's feel in a user suit.  We see a small bug that prevents to share it with the developer? <br><br><ul><li>  need to be interrupted (people use your application, but not bugs seek out, they read something / listen / watch / play in your application) </li><li>  find a way to send feedback: <br><ul><li>  look for the developer's email, launch an email client, write a letter - not everyone will decide on it, even if it is the fall of the application for which they paid. </li><li>  look for feedback button  If you have seen, then it is already easier, we must remember where.  If you haven‚Äôt seen it, where did the idea come from? What is it? </li></ul></li><li>  drive away the thought: ‚ÄúDoes the developer need this?  He probably doesn't need such a trifle. ‚Äù </li></ul><br><br><h4>  So after all what to do? </h4><br>  It seems the solution lies on the surface - you need to give the user the opportunity to share his thoughts: <br><ul><li>  so that the distraction from the main occupation was minimal </li><li>  leave a response / comment should be as simple as possible </li><li>  a person must feel that his opinion is important </li></ul><br>  It seems to us that the answer now is almost obvious - you need to ask the person about the features and problems.  If you have mail or other user contacts, then you are very lucky, you have at least some opportunity, of course, not without drawbacks.  Another option is to ask such questions in the application.  When and whom to ask, you have to decide for yourself, and you can do this with the help of the service you would like to submit - <a href="http://www.glazum.com/">Glazum</a> . <br><br><h4>  What is Glazum for? </h4><br>  With the help of Glazum, you can ask users questions, request feedback and measure previously inaccessible metrics, for example, <a href="http://www.netpromoter.com/why-net-promoter/about-net-promoter/">Net Promoter</a> . <br>  The appearance of questions is completely under the control of the developer; for this purpose, special markers are placed in the application code, and at any time it will be possible to link a question to them through the panel on the site.  When and to whom the question should be shown in the question settings through special display criteria. <br><br><h5>  Markers </h5><br>  The marker approach provides a balance between controlling the appearance of a question and flexibility.  There can be any number of markers, they need to mark significant events in your code (the button is pressed, the volume is changed, the purchase is made, etc.).  Placing them is no more difficult than tracking events with mobile analytics. <br><br><pre><code class="objectivec hljs">[Glazum setMarker:<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">@"button pressed"</span></span>];</code> </pre> <br>  At the same time, there is another more advanced option for installing a label. <br><br><pre> <code class="objectivec hljs">[Glazum setMarker:<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">@"button pressed"</span></span> doBefore: ^(<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">BOOL</span></span> willShowQuestion) { <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//do before block } doAfter:^(BOOL questionWasShown) { //do after block }];</span></span></code> </pre><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f0/548/f36/8f0548f36b3bd9718b19a1c3d1f594ff.png">  This method allows you to prepare an application for a question (for example, to stop playing music), and after closing the question window, perform some actions (resume playback). <br><br><h5>  User reply type </h5><br>  When creating a question, you have the opportunity to choose the type of user response. <br>  This can be a short and detailed answer in a free form, a single and multiple choice from the proposed options or the calculation of <a href="http://www.netpromoter.com/why-net-promoter/about-net-promoter/">Net Promote Score</a> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Examples of question options with different kinds of answers</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f29/e33/32a/f29e3332a644619f7f94dbc2a3dfe9e1.png"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/727/34d/6de/72734d6def5cf88df5d40dbd89debc5b.png"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/084/15f/abe/08415fabe55407fd7a75bab25a1b1c94.png"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/60c/41a/f3f/60c41af3fe60eaf85f272c2fc41bb1ca.png"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5dd/f09/fc5/5ddf09fc53f29b69c04728d8475ee6ed.png"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f8d/444/0f6/f8d4440f6bfbe513d73a37df0d86de73.png"></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div></div><br><br><h5>  Question Criteria </h5><br>  Glazum has a large number of different criteria for displaying a question.  Here are some abstract examples: <br><ul><li>  <i>Show the question only to random 20% of users</i> - if you have a lot of users, you can limit the selection </li><li>  <i>Show the question to those from Russia, Ukraine, etc.</i>  - if you want to ask a specific question, for example, in Russian. </li><li>  <i>Show a question only to users of the iOS version higher or equal to 7.0</i> - it‚Äôs interesting to know the opinion of users under the new operating system </li><li>  <i>Show a question to users who run the application more than 20 times</i> - a good criterion for user loyalty </li><li>  <i>Show question to users who have added to favorites more than 5 times</i> - to those who intensively use some feature. </li></ul><br>  If you have the ability to somehow identify users, for example, there is a login in the application, then you can make a call <br><br><pre> <code class="objectivec hljs">[Glazum setUserIdentifier:<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">@"example@example.com"</span></span>];</code> </pre><br>  This will allow you to use criteria based on this information, say ask specific users. <br><br>  If you use user variables, for example, during A / B testing, then you have the opportunity to ask different questions to different groups of users. <br><br><pre> <code class="objectivec hljs">[Glazum setCustomVariable:<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">@"true"</span></span> named:<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">@"ab-test-printing"</span></span>];</code> </pre><br>  All you need to do is create a question whose <i>ab-test-printing</i> value in the display criteria is either true or false. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/097/4eb/6dc/0974eb6dcfdf90ddbe3afdd07811217a.png"><h4>  Price </h4><br>  Glazum is currently free.  We plan to consider the pricing policy in the near future (there will be a free plan), but now we want to concentrate efforts on increasing the value of the product through new very interesting features. <br><br>  For current users, we will try to create the most comfortable conditions.  Therefore, we invite everyone to register right now! <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  To summarize, how will Glazum help you? <br><ul><li>  Glazum will improve the product: <br><ul><li>  By asking one question, you will determine which new feature your users are waiting for the most. </li><li>  You will learn about the unknown problems and difficulties faced by your users. </li></ul></li><li>  Glazum will provide an opportunity to better understand their users.  For example, to understand why they made purchases or stopped at some step.  To do this, simply ask the appropriate question at the right time. </li><li>  As a consequence of the preceding paragraphs, Glazum can increase your revenue and user loyalty. </li></ul><br>  Your opinion is very important to us, so we wrote this post.
