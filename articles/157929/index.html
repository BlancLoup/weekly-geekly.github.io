A competent analytics of user behavior will help improve your impact on the visitor and the marketing strategy of the application.  And as a result, increase sales. <br><br>  I would like to share my experience and a few important points from my practice, which are well reflected in our <a href="http://turnplay.ramotion.com/en">Turnplay</a> product. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are several main points of useful impact coming product page on the product: <br>  - Transmission of a message about the expected product, its advantages or the uniqueness of solving the problem of the consumer; <br>  - Collect customer base for future product.  If a person signs up, then he is interested, because no one will subscribe for spam today; <br>  - Receive feedback and customer feedback before the publication of the product and after its release; <br>  - Evaluation of the success of the product, before entering the market; <br>  - Ability to make changes to the marketing program, correcting possible errors in the upcoming release;

      <br>
      So what can you do and use in order for coming soon to bring the above benefits? <br><br><h4>  Design and interactivity. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/63c/f49/64c/63cf4964c8f9813aa5a33b3b5399f801.jpg"><br><br>  In my opinion, the design is the most important.  It would be better if your coming soon page had a catchy illustration, a render, a beautiful product icon that will attract a visitor.  It is desirable to have elements of interactivity, on your site, people will want to press or twist something.  It is desirable that the design is well remembered by visitors! <br><br><h4>  The text message is message. </h4><br>  When a visitor is inspired by visual content, you can tell him something about your product - it could be some kind of quote, intrigue, or immediate specifics about the product. <br><br><h4>  Subscription and Value for the visitor. </h4><br>  The correct text will call the visitor to subscribe to the newsletter, so as not to miss any buns, which can then be obtained on the first day of release.  What is one of the factors affecting the interest of the product, because free content in all its manifestations is a potential benefit and value for the visitor.  The visitor is happy, leaves the email, but what next?  How else can he help us? <br><br><h4>  Social network. </h4><br>  Be sure to add social buttons to the page so that the visitor can tell about your site to your friends on social networks and thereby expand your customer base. <br><br><h4>  Video. </h4><br>  If you still have time, you can upload a video so that a potential user can understand more clearly what he will receive as a result when the product goes on sale. <br><br><h4>  Promotion and analysis. </h4><br>  Okay, the site is ready, but from us it is neither cold nor hot.  How to attract the audience?  How to determine where to invest money and effort? <br><br>  In our time, to arouse interest in your product, you need to show it everywhere!  When I speak everywhere, I mean all possible Internet marketing tools, social networks and other resources. <br><br>  The first tool for me personally is Twitter and Facebook.  As soon as the site is published, tell us about it, ask your subscribers to retweet / repost your message.  Contact Facebook owners who have the most targeted audience for your product. <br><br>  Use contextual advertising in AdWords with Google, in any case, as recommended by American startups.  Take the low-frequency and most targeted requests and start attracting people.  Analyze which ads work, which do not.  Remember, gaining traffic is not the main thing, the main thing is that the visitors were your target audience. <br><br>  And be sure to measure the result at each stage so that you can understand which tools work best.  Watch how visitors navigate your site, what they do, where they click. <br><br>  One way to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of coming soon page is a custom behavior map. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/336/d75/d53/336d75d5335a7e772d8bf70371438a10.jpg"><br><br>  The color of the spot depends on the number of clicks - the more clicks, the warmer and redder the spot. <br><br>  Using it on the coming soon page of our product, it is very curious to observe that site visitors actively clicked on illustrations of a vinyl player, tonerm and pitch.  Here it is obvious that they need interactivity of these elements. <br><br>  Everything is very clear, the click card works to evaluate the behavior of visitors and allows you to improve coming soon page, as they say, on the fly.  An excellent reason to experiment with the design and texts of your coming soon page. <br><br>  When building a click map, the <a href="http://metrika.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Metrick</a> tool was used - <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/metrika/%3Fid%3D1112943">a click map</a> . <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Do not be afraid to spend your efforts and funds on creating coming soon page, because it is a tool to influence potential users and get their reaction to your offer. <br><br>  With proper use of this tool, you can provide yourself with a decent level of sales from the moment the product is released. <br>  See for yourself how it works: <a href="http://turnplay.ramotion.com/en">http://turnplay.ramotion.com/en</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157929/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157929/</a></p>
