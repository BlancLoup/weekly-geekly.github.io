    <h2>  What is worth remembering when purchasing hosting </h2><br>  The contract for hosting is for a period of one month or more, payment for hosting must be paid regularly, as hosting providers automatically block unpaid sites and all services associated with this. <br><br>  Contracts at hosters, as a rule, are ‚Äústandard‚Äù, they will not be edited for the requests of your lawyer.  Invoices are sent automatically to the mail specified at the conclusion of the contract. <br><br><h2>  Top 5 Questions for Your Hosting Provider </h2><br><ol><li>  What is the contact mail specified in the contract?  When entering into an agreement, specify several mailboxes to receive notifications about payments, technical works, etc.  - it will minimize non-payment due to the ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù (for example, vacation / hospital responsible specialist at the time of payment). </li><li>  Who is the contract?  It is better to place it not on an individual, for example, a system administrator or IT-specialist, but on a company. </li><li>  Are there licenses for Telematics and Data Transmission?  The absence of these documents is unacceptable. </li><li>  Where is the hosting data center?  If you plan to work in Russia, then the data center should be located in the territory of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Is there access to the hosting control panel?  If you have not previously been sent access (for example, due to the fault of the developers of the site), then request them and organize the proper storage of account information.  Access is always three lines of data: host address, login and password. </li></ol><br><h2>  Domain: part of the company's intangible asset </h2><br>  A domain name can be a transaction object.  Its registration is carried out after the conclusion of the relevant agreement with the company-registrar.  Settlement of controversial issues is carried out within the framework of Russian legislation. <br><br><ul><li>  Domain names .ru, .com, .net, etc.  - These are first level domains, they are not sold in the usual way.  Such sales are planned to begin only 2020. </li><li>  Second-level domain names are mercedes.com, sk.ru, web-canape.ru, yandex.ru, google.com, etc. </li><li>  When buying a second-level domain, you acquire not one domain, but a whole cluster: <a href="http://www.vash-domen.ru/">www.vash-domen.ru</a> , vash-domen.ru, test.vash-domen.ru, test2.vash-domen.ru, etc. </li></ul><br><h3>  Domain rights give: </h3><br><ul><li>  the ability to connect domain corporate mail; </li><li>  create subdomains of the third and fourth level; </li><li>  host sites on your domain and its subdomains; </li><li>  sell or donate a domain name. </li></ul><br>  The domain name is not bought ‚Äúforever‚Äù - it is paid annually, sometimes the renewal period can be extended to 3 years.  If the domain name is not renewed on time, then within a day all your websites, mailboxes and other services associated with domain names will stop working. <br><br><h3>  What is worth remembering when buying a domain </h3><br><ul><li>  Hosting rights are not related to domain or site rights. </li><li>  Even if the domain is ‚Äúgiven as a gift‚Äù when buying a hosting, specify who will own the rights to it, who is the registrar and what will happen if you decide to move to another hosting company </li><li>  Make sure the domain is legally owned by your organization. </li><li>  Pay for renewals in a timely manner. </li><li>  As the administrator's contact mailbox, specify an e-mail not associated with the domain name. </li><li>  Pay attention to the domain name, it should not duplicate or contain another brand in its name.  Since its owner can have such a domain sue or ban its use at any time. </li></ul><br><h2>  Site rights </h2><br>  A site can be created using one of the following schemes: <br><br><ul><li>  constructor - wix, ucoz, tilda, etc.  - you own only the content of the site that you placed on the template; </li><li>  Website based on a template on a free CMS, such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, etc.  - you own the content, the version of the CMS with modifications; </li><li>  site with an individual design on a paid or commercial CMS - you own a license, design rights, rights to software modules, content. </li></ul><br><h3>  What is worth remembering when ordering a website </h3><br><ul><li>  Be sure to enter into a development contract, even if you work with a freelancer or create a site through an employee of your company </li><li>  When ordering a website, specify the question of future improvements, guarantees and technical support. </li><li>  Fix the transfer of rights to design, content, CMS or software improvements </li><li>  Appoint a responsible person for control over the information that will be published on the site. </li></ul><br><h3>  What are the risks </h3><br><ul><li>  No contract for the site - no your rights to it.  Do not be surprised if you see a complete copy of your project. </li><li>  Domain and hosting purchased by your employee - there is a risk of blackmail and demands to redeem these assets from him </li><li>  An unpaid domain name is instantly redeemed, and you completely lose the right to it. </li><li>  With the loss of a domain name, you lose your site, corporate email and some of your reputation. </li></ul><br><h3>  What you need to remember? </h3><br><ul><li>  Do not use photos and texts taken without the consent of their owners. </li><li>  Graphic materials must be prepared independently or purchased on specialized exchanges. </li><li>  You should find out in advance what rights you have to the CMS license on which the site is developed </li><li>  Make sure that all copyrights to use your site‚Äôs graphic template are observed. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5ca/5e5/10a/5ca5e510a0b148a69dfec765c7573de6.png"><br><br>  Imagine you developed a unique graphic material, wrote interesting texts, programmed services, put it all on your site, and after a couple of days you see that this information is copied to other sites without any mention of the original source. <br><br><h3>  How to defend your rights </h3><br><ul><li>  We put on the site sign Copyright </li><li>  We create a section in which we describe the rules for using materials from your site. </li><li>  When a copy is found, we write an official request to the owners of the site on a letterhead. </li><li>  We write requests for copyright infringement in the hosting service or designer that hosts the site, with a request to block the project </li><li>  We write requests to Google </li><li>  All letters are supported by evidence </li><li>  If it doesn't help, we go to court. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/aaf/bc8/561/aafbc8561b0244f5bd1c7b6a42c261ac.png"><br>  <i>Copyright Infringement Notification</i> <br><br><h3>  What else can you do </h3><br><ul><li>  Register the newly created texts in Yandex.Webmaster </li><li>  We put a software module to protect against copying texts </li><li>  We impose a watermark on the author's photo </li><li>  We add hidden links to texts that lead to your site. </li></ul><br><h3>  When copying materials from our site is useful? </h3><br><ul><li>  If the copied texts and graphic materials contain a link to your site </li><li>  If you are promoting a new idea or technology, information about which it is advisable to distribute, as widely as possible </li><li>  If you add your texts to Yandex.Webmaster, their theft will be recorded, and the plagiarist site will fall under search sanctions </li></ul><br><h2>  Work with personal data </h2><br>  Since July 1, 2017, fines for violating the law have increased.
