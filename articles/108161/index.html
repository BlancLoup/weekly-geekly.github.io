  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About Yota and "Zhzhzh"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost imperceptibly, but in front of everyone, Yota from a startup has turned into a serious business.  Well, seriously ... back in 2008, she barely caught on Tverskaya, and in the summer of 2009 the commercial operation of the network started.  In the fall of 2010, the subscriber base consisted of 680,000 subscribers, revenues amounted to 2.6 billion rubles, EBITDA (profit before taxes, interest and depreciation) was 220 million rubles, and a successful launch of LTE took place in Kazan.  In general, in the minds of a large number of people, the term LTE appeared precisely after Yota first announced construction, and then launched the network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd0/726/4dd/dd07264dd4e020c8f92dc3b694f5698b.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yota/blog/107982/">official statement of the</a> company, this year alone investments in business development amounted to $ 110.6 million and by the end of the year this figure will grow to $ 166.7 million. What are these funds going to?  The main items of expenditure are the purchase of equipment ($ 57.3 million), construction and installation work ($ 33.1 million), data centers and transport network ($ 14.8 million).  Looks like another cut?  And what, an interesting option - to steal credit money from yourself :) To cut money from Russian technologies?  Perhaps, although Denis Sverdlov (CEO of Scartel) in his interviews said more than once that Rostec never invested anything in Yota.

      To judge whether Yota is good or bad, you can compare it with yourself.  And you can start with the memories of what kind of Internet greyten triken provided before the fourth player made them move.  It seems to me that there is nothing special to remember here - the Internet was a complete failure, but even he had the audacity to sell at indecently high prices.  What can I say - the price can still go up to 5 rubles for a 3G-megabyte.  But in general, it seemed to be a little bit better - unlimited tariffs appeared (all of which were unlimitedly spelled out in small white font on white paper), they began to fight for the client at least a little.  What do you think, why did this happen?  Agree that this "LJ" is no accident.  But we are still charged with money for the mobile communication that has remained without competition - the same one percent of revenues (which the FAS fined operators for high roaming prices) will still be charged to us, multiplying several times. <br><br>  The same LTE-network throughout Kazan (about 150 BS; I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/gToday/blog/103173/">wrote</a> about it) was built in just 2 months - and this is not a Wi-Fi-grid in the apartment to throw.  Here the organization is much more complicated and expensive, with a bunch of specialists, management and "paper" fuss - it is unlikely that a company created for drinking will work at such a pace.  Even the president of the regional Huawei was extremely surprised by such efficiency and in an interview with RBC <a href="http://www.rbcdaily.ru/2010/10/01/media/515132">said</a> that "in Russia there was no such thing yet."  I wrote this paragraph and unwittingly remembered a recently seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DPs0DSihggio">video</a> in which the Chinese are building a 15-story hotel in 6 days - to crank up like that, you need to really try hard and, apparently, have some good incentive (the same ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù in Moscow years, which was spent a quarter of $ 260 million). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/166/7f2/f92/1667f2f92546a85f94c0a1ce8df2f459.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I agree that "at least some Internet, but at least in the deep forest" is good - the operators will actually have more coverage.  But <s>they have a wider muzzle,</s> after all, and for all three companies there are even fewer little ones - a little more, and each of them will have a third ten.  Do you think that they, too, started with covering the whole of Russia?  Of course, no - just in those years there was no Internet, so that you could cry in the comments.  Yes, Yota does not work everywhere, it is not always good, but somewhere it does not work at all - I think the company‚Äôs most interesting is still ahead.  I don‚Äôt know if this is a lot or a little (relatively), but only this year 1,100 base stations were built, and even those are overloaded.  Apparently, this is quite a lot - at the same Megaphone in the Moscow region is now only 1600 stations (with support for <s>LJ</s> 3G).  In general, while more or less lucky only such "millionaires" like Moscow, St. Petersburg, Ufa, Sochi and Krasnodar, and the rest nothing to do but hope and wait. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/294/3cd/66d/2943cd66dec5210b326c5474a9b6164d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Somewhere on the roofs of Kazan ...</i> <br><br>  By the way, the network in Kazan is now fully operational and depreciation is already taking place, but the network itself is not yet functioning.  Why?  Because LTE is in all sorts of Japan-Norway and Sweden, where the legal framework is in step with innovators, in every way contributing to the development and introduction of new technologies ... And as always, go ahead.  The demonstrative desire to internetize the whole country (which would be a solid step forward for the whole of Russia!) Does not agree with the case, but somewhere even contradicts itself.  Neither permits, nor frequencies, nor even the LTE term in the legislative base ... For only one assistance in introducing innovations to the head of Kazan, you can erect a monument, despite the fact that other people should be engaged at a higher level.  After all, it would seem that the president has such an IT darling - he has his iPad, Lake, and even verified account on Twitter) <br><br>  By and large, the companies are a little over a year old, but in this short time she managed to release some cool devices, many of which still warm the souls of people like me.  Starting from the symbiotic HTC MAX (in which HTC thought more about themselves than Yota; by the way, about 7000 subscribers of the provider now use this communicator and they are the most active consumers of music) and practical ‚Äúwhistles‚Äù / ‚Äújingle‚Äù, ending with a wireless autonomous router Yota Egg, which among the gadgets I have among the first in importance.  This is just a godsend for many offices, students and just active network users - I constantly take the ‚Äúegg‚Äù with me to all conferences and very often many of my colleagues sit through it.  By the way, the scout kit in the form of "Yota Egg + iPad / Netbook" is becoming increasingly popular. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c9/177/846/5c9177846c92b009fd54279eff791599.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Frame from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/69028/">comparative test of</a> USB-modem from Yota and WiMAX-module in netbook EeePC 1005HAG</i> <br><br>  What will happen next?  Denis Sverdlov has already said that Yota is preparing an LTE-phone on the android.  It is clear that they will produce it in Taiwan.  This is logical, otherwise where else to do it?  In Russia, the industry is not ready for such feats - again, there are no specialists (although if there is a search, then there are) no machines.  And it is not known what kind of ‚Äúpenny‚Äù we would have had for such an initiative.  Modern technologies cannot just come out of the air and, if not counting on the state, then the industry can only be built by the market, only by effective private companies. <br><br>  It is comforting that at least on the Internet and telecoms Russia has not yet managed to fall behind to minus infinity - Yandex competes quite seriously with Google, vkontakte is more popular than Facebook, and the placers of our specialists work in the valleys of different degrees of silicon.  And if the Internet was good (and the infrastructure as a whole) everywhere, all indicators would be even higher - only for this reason, the development of Internet technologies cannot be slowed down.  It is technologies, and not any services there, because if there is no access to the network, then the services will not be needed by anyone.  I use the services of this company almost from the very beginning and, observing the whole picture from the side, I really see only Yota‚Äôs opportunity to make a global good thing - it‚Äôs this company that changes the format of Internet consumption, giving freedom movement and independence from stationary access to the network.  This, of course, if we talk about fair-speed and unlimited access, and not about what the big three offers on their USB-modems, highlighting the desire to once again be welded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9eb/22e/56e/9eb22e56e7480203592ce0f5c937bdf3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The real speed of the wireless connection in the LTE network in Kazan.</i>  <i>But <a href="">the</a> speed in more "greenhouse" conditions</i> <br><br>  At the ideological and practical level, Yota leads the market away from vicious traffic in traffic towards consumption, albeit not cheap, but high-quality and, in many ways, unique service.  It‚Äôs not hard to imagine what it would be like if you had quick access at your fingertips - this includes navigation, music, video calls, new social opportunities, and ... yes, there is a lot more to come up with. <br><br>  Why am I writing all this?  In fact, the text would be fair in many respects for Intel, whose initiatives (in our country) are treated with similar skepticism - everyone wants for free, all at once.  So I decided not to write to the corporate blog of Intel and started talking about a completely different company, which many people disbelieve, but at the same time, the arrival of which is so expected in their regions. <br><br>  At a minimum, I expressed my point of view on what is happening in the world of mobile Internet.  As a maximum, I tried to make adequate people (I consider that the majority of the population of the leading IT community of Runet) to stop thinking for no reason about cutting the dough and instead of doing business, instead of doing business, then at least constructive criticism.  Why do we have all this negative, which, as an active author, I have to watch from a post to a post?  I thought a lot about it, but this question seems to be rhetorical.  It seems to me that the beginning of all beginnings is the absence of even a primitive belief in ourselves, in our country ‚Äî in this situation, we really will not grow here.  But we are still the most incredible state with the greatest potential in all areas. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108161/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108161/</a></p>
