    <h6>  Pig and rooster </h6><br>  Apparently, the lecturer's favorite story, because the slide met with her in presentation 7 times :) <br><br>  And so, met the pig and rooster.  Rooster offered to open his restaurant and call it "Pork and Eggs."  To which the pig refused: "You will only participate, and I will give myself entirely." <br><br>  In terms of SCRUM pigs are developers, the rooster is a project manager.  The essence of the story: the pig is more important than the rooster.  The essence of SCRUM: developers are more important than a manager, you can not ignore the opinions of the first. <br><br><h6>  How it all started </h6><br>  The leaders of large software companies decided to develop a common style of work, which was later called Agile. <br>  The main document, one might say, the code of commandments, is the manifesto "Manifesto for Agile Software Development". <br>  It reads: <br>  <b>People and relationships</b> above processes and tools <br>  <b>A working product is</b> better than detailed documentation. <br>  <b>Customer relationship is</b> more important than signed contracts. <br>  <b>Readiness for change is</b> more important than following plans. <br><br>  In English <br>  <b>Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools <br>  <b>Working software</b> over comprehensive documentation <br>  <b>Customer collaboration</b> over contract negotiation <br>  <b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan <br><br>  At the forefront is a person, because it is he who produces the product.  If the process causes irritation, it should be changed.  If the tool is inconvenient, it should be discarded. <br>  The customer pays for the working draft, and not for its description. <br>  It is also important to be ready for changes in the project.  The team must be flexible in terms of opportunities. <br><br><h6>  Agile Development Principles </h6><br><br>  The main principles are: <br><ul><li>  Deliveries of new product versions should be regular and made as early as possible. </li><li>  If the customer wants to change something in the product, you need to do it at any stage of development (if this is of course possible) </li><li>  It is important to release a working product as often as possible.  Desirable period from 2 weeks to 2 months </li><li>  Developers and businessmen (those who are responsible for working with the customer) should work together. </li><li>  Good working conditions.  Developer should be comfortable working </li><li>  More personal meetings </li></ul><br><br>  I will explain a little.  Agile is customizable.  But this does not mean that any whim should be performed without primitive.  It is necessary to ensure a dialogue between business people, customer and programmer. <br>  The product should be released quite often - it's like a blog - the more often you write useful posts, the more people read you and are not removed from friends.  The customer does not need a product that is updated every half year and increases the functionality for a couple of features.  There is still need to remember about competition. <br>  Well, a satisfied and motivated programmer will write the code better than if he were sitting in a damp basement and was undernourished. <br><br>  There are two more points.  They are technical. <br>  1. Each new version of the product should do more than the previous one. <br>  2. You need to initially write the code well, so as not to rewrite it later, and preserve its quality.  If you need to refactor. <br><br><h6>  Success Tayot's or Lean thinking </h6><br><br>  The example of Tayota is indicative: she bought the unprofitable production of a single American company (sorry, I forgot the name) along with the workers and equipment, and brought this production into a plus.  The key to success was Lean Production. <br><br>  Its principles are: <br><ul><li>  Get rid of all the excess </li><li>  Monitor quality </li><li>  Respect people </li><li>  Increase experience </li><li>  Postpone the decision to the last moment </li><li>  Deliver product quickly </li><li>  Optimize the process </li></ul><br><br>  Why put off the decision and how to deliver the product at the same time?  It's simple: the decision should be thoughtful and consistent, it will help avoid problems in production and speed up the time of product release. <br><br>  Perhaps the key is getting rid of all the excess. <br>  Any extra process or procedure adds value to the product.  Each area has its own list of superfluous.  For software development it is: <br><ul><li>  Unfinished work.  Remember that nobody needs an unfinished feature.  You need to try to bring everything to the end </li><li>  Extra processes.  These are the ones that are made "for show". </li><li>  Additional features.  If the customer asks only the opportunity to open the text, do not make it possible to edit it. </li><li>  Switch between tasks.  The programmer should not rush between two projects. </li><li>  Transfer product.  Because it takes extra resources. </li><li>  Expectation.  If the project needs something, he should not wait and sit idle. </li><li>  Defects.  It's bad everywhere :) </li></ul><br><br><h6>  A little bit about SCRUM </h6><br>  It is part of the Agile &amp; Lean software project development.  As I wrote, it is part of tactical planning. <br><br>  SCRUM cycle consists of: <br>  1. Actually software development.  The process in 1-4 weeks with daily rallies. <br>  2. The end of the sprint.  Again, the rally at which the developers show everyone what they have done. <br>  3. Retrospective meeting - analysis of mistakes and problems, successes and improvements. <br><br>  PS: this week ended all training meetings.  From Monday to the battle.  In general, we are ready.  Fight will show :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50678/</a></p>
