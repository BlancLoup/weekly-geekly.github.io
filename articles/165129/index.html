  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About Sony Xperia Z from CES 2013</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sony did not easily enter the smartphone market: the legacy of a ‚Äúbrand for two‚Äù - Sony Ericsson - was hanging weights and the previous line came out indistinct. <br><br>  Despite the fact that we criticized the Xperia series of 2012 (with which we didn‚Äôt manage to knock down the Sony Ericsson round label), it‚Äôs very cool that the company‚Äôs sales still started, thanks largely to the waterproof V-series smartphone.  Its successful positioning as the ‚Äúfirst dust-proof Android-smartphone‚Äù and the right price did the trick. <br><br>  Now at CES 2013, the Japanese showed what they had been waiting for so long: their first truly solo product, the flagship 5-inch Xperia Z smartphone. It turned out to be uncompromising and charismatic, truly ‚Äúsonistaylovym.‚Äù

Here he is!  It‚Äôs not clear how Sony does it: it seems that LG Optimus G was just in the hands - it‚Äôs also all so square and brutal, but Sony somehow has it all ... differently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66f/3f2/f02/66f3f2f02efa9cad9c861eed7bcf6d18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The new PR legend says that this design is called OmniBalance, and the word Omni, meaning ‚Äúeverything‚Äù in Latin, means in this context that ‚Äúthe design is balanced and symmetrical‚Äù.  Roughly speaking, the phone can be kept differently, and that same notorious experience (sorry for this word) will be the same from all sides.  But these are all lyrics, and personal tactile sensations are as follows: very cool!  Compared with the feeling that arises when you take the iPhone in your hand.  The case is thin - the thickness is 7.9 mm, and the phone itself weighs 146 grams, i.e.  almost not felt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/088/3fa/0a6/0883fa0a6182c1c3a1cab1ac83988432.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/919/15a/240/91915a240b5b1670df56ae019b9d69d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are only three colors of the case: black, white, purple.  But white is definitely the best, it looks the most neat, largely due to the fact that it is almost not visible fingerprints. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf2/2f8/3b5/bf22f83b5bd6876af5624ccf86484335.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Materials </h4><br>  The main problem of modern hatchery Android smartphones is the widespread use of plastic, and Sony has been waiting for something unusual.  Please: The Xperia Z case is made of tempered glass, and the frame around the contour is made of polyamide fiberglass, whatever that means.  The construction uses moderately metal, everything is very solid, rich, thoroughbred. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b48/2e0/26d/b482e026da290920c79f7bbcfbd87d7a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Here, for example, looks like an aluminum power button: it is raised, pressed nicely, with a little effort, it looks stylish and old school</i> <br><br>  Sony continues to exploit the chip with moisture resistance and dust protection: the smartphone is made according to the standards IP55 and IP57 (yes, they stress that both certificates are received), this means that it can dive for 30 minutes to a depth of 1 meter.  Accordingly, all connectors are covered with tight plugs, including a slot for a micro SIM card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d29/507/4bc/d295074bc0a6893f9d54a80dfe02adda.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4be/ae0/fcc/4beae0fcc6083945d2593d932b801ef3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f4/e92/ff0/4f4e92ff0e69d184804da8ffcd3c86e5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  We have not yet seen the best in smartphones - it's just fantastic!  Five trendy FullHD inches in Sony terminology are called Reality Display, and I want to write ‚ÄúRetina Display‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb3/ed4/b57/bb3ed4b5793bf3d8a47b289532c4213e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The screen with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 has the highest definition among all smartphones on the market with a density of 443 pixels per inch.  The color rendition and color saturation are very cool, for which respects are already the second iteration of the Mobile BRAVIA Engine technology.  Also, OptiContrast technology was used, which combines two familiar chips from the previous line: the absence of an air gap (No Air Gap) and a thinner ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù of the screen, which lacks one layer (the sensors are applied directly to the protective glass, making the screen thinner and more sensitive to pressing ). <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  If the company uses the displays of its television department in the display, then the technology of the photo / video department went into the development of the camera.  Again, Sony sets a record: the Xperia Z uses a specially developed for this smartphone 13 MP Exmor RS matrix, which supports HDR mode not only for photos, but also for video, for the first time on the market.  Accordingly, good shots should be obtained both against the light and in conditions where the picture is strongly contrasting.  Well, in case of poor lighting, the pictures should also be suitable, because it uses a new noise reduction system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6c/209/cb7/e6c209cb771eee8cf523fbbd6391ac32.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The front camera (2 MP), by the way, also supports HDR.  It is also stated that Sony Xperia Z is the best Point-and-Shoot camera phone when you do not need to set anything up in advance: the camera automatically determines the best shooting mode and sets the appropriate settings.  It's easy to believe, because the best soap dish on the market is the Sony RX100, which ideally works just in the ‚Äúpoint-and-shoot‚Äù mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/bf2/688/9debf26882343e4d93494864ab721371.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Xperia Z camera supports fast shooting: 10 frames per second with a resolution of 9 megapixels, and the time and number of frames is unlimited - you can shoot until the memory runs out.  Finally, you can take pictures right while shooting video, without interrupting the process and not switching to another mode.  But this is no longer news. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  Of course, the smartphone is working on the most recent, 4-core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor, the other from the flagship Sony could not have been expected.  Two gigabytes of RAM, 16 gigs of internal memory and support for microSD-cards, it's all without question.  Zedka can work in LTE networks (Russian networks are supported) and is equipped with an NFC module.  With the help of NFC, it is proposed, for example, to display a picture on BRAVIA TVs, since all new Sony remote controls will support NFC, and will quickly connect the smartphone to the TV.  And the model Xperia ZL has a long-range infrared port, so that it can be used to control any TV or other device directly. <br><br>  As for the software, in addition to Sony's own WALKMAN application, they reworked the gallery and video player, they now have a new interface and various mini-improvements, for example, the ability to zoom in the gallery in the thumbnail view mode. <br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  Non-removable battery, quite capacious - it is 2400 mAh, which is logical for such a device with a bright display.  It is argued that the STAMINA technology used in Xperia Z increases the standby time by as much as four times, but this, of course, needs to be checked.  You can independently choose programs that will work in STAMINA mode.  There is also a fast charge function, but we do not yet have exact data on it. <br><br><h4>  Kit </h4><br>  Two contacts on the left side of the case, as it were, hint that they should put the gadget in the docking station - horizontally, like a TV.  So it is, and to install the gadget, you do not need to move the plugs back so that you do not blab them on the waterproof smartphone once again.  The docking station is included in the package, and it will be the same color as the smartphone itself.  And in the complete set there will be very good Sony EX300ap headphones, which, if you buy them separately, cost 2000-2500 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/111/cbc/e52/111cbce52f9dc2a9eb4e14ccb58b37de.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Xperia z vs xperia zl </h4><br>  In addition to Xperia Z at CES 2013, the Xperia ZL was announced.  At first, they were afraid that the story of the official smartphone of James Bond, Sony Xperia T, which did not enter the Russian retail market, would be repeated, and the TX model was sold instead.  But the second time, Sony has not stepped on the same rake: both smartphones will be sold in Russia. <br><br>  ZL is designed for those who love a more traditional design.  On the filling, smartphones are identical, but the ZL is smaller in size.  With the same diagonal of the display, it has a thinner frame and in general, Sony said that it is a smartphone with the smallest frame among all competitors (apparently, they considered the usable area).  The ZL has a ribbed back surface, there are two body colors (white and black), the model is not waterproof and will not include a docking station.  But the built-in infrared port, which is written above.  ZL will cost a little less than Z. We will definitely tell about this smartphone separately. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Android smartphones have recently become similar to each other, testing gadgets on this platform, it is difficult to get rid of the feeling of deja vu.  But still he appeared - the first Android-smartphone that I want to buy for personal use.  Xperia Z is the most powerful Sony comeback that brings the brand back to the top league of the mobile phone market.  And if you do not consider the Motorola DROID, which is not released on the Russian market, the Sony Xperia Z is the best thing that happened with Android. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165129/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165129/</a></p>
