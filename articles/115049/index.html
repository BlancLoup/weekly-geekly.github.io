This post has nothing to do with my current job. <br><br>  Games are quite an important part of my life, but not too significant.  I spent a lot of time developing games.  Now I spend a little time playing games and want to use the best.  Of course, I am not ashamed to pay for what brings me pleasure. <br><br>  Over the past 5 years I have watched a lot of games, but those for which I would like to pay were in the minority.  Paying for a game that bothers you in 10 minutes is pointless.  Such developers rely only on advertising and ignorant buyers.

      Therefore, I have identified a specific list of developers to whom I am willing to pay money for their work.  Because it gives me pleasure.  These included Valve.  Half-Life was a masterpiece.  And Half-Life 2 is also a very good product.  As soon as a new game from Valve came out, I knew that I had to buy it.  The point is not that I could not download the game from torrents.  I could.  But I wanted to support the company.  And still, most of my acquaintances play pirates ‚Äî I like the game ‚Äî I pay for it.  And I will hope that they will release a version under linux;) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  That's how I lived until recently.  By the will of circumstances, I managed to move from Moscow to the states.  Well, after a certain time, I wanted to have fun and play the masterpiece game Half-life 2. Logged in to Steam, I learned that the game I bought was regionally locked up.  What to do?  Write to the technical support of your favorite company, of course.  I wrote it, but they told me that they would be happy to help remove the game from the Steam, so that I could pay them again. <br><br>  Hm  I already paid them.  And ready to pay in the future.  For example, Portal 2 will be released soon, I did not think for a minute that I would not buy this game. <br><br>  I wrote all this in the support that I would not pay twice for the product I had already bought.  Even if it costs only $ 10 now.  I honestly paid for it.  And a lot more money. <br><br>  After the answer of the sapport, that they could not help me, and if they could, then I need confirmation of my purchase - I was in despair.  All that I believed was crushed.  Now I knew that unicorns do not exist and they do not shit butterflies.  Portal 2 I would not have bought, most likely. <br><br>  But nevertheless, I respected the company that made HL, CS, HL2 ... I redirected all traffic through Russia, which would bypass the test for the regions and could enjoy Half-Life 2 in the next time. For this I needed firewall Winows 7 and SOCKS 5 proxy on Debian Lenny in Moscow. <br><br>  I honestly wrote about this in the support that I found a way to play, but I still want an official decision. <br><br>  And what would you think.  They have long tried to confirm that I am me.  What exactly did I pay for their games.  And then they deleted my purchases that were made from the territory of Russia.  So that I could buy their product again.  How condescending of them !!!  I told them more than once that I had already paid and just wanted to get mine.  But it did not help. <br><br>  It is after such an attitude that you start to wonder if there are unicorns? <br><br>  UPD.  I‚Äôm not glad that I shared my problem with Habr - I‚Äôve watched how karma is poured for two, although I may deserve it;) But I didn‚Äôt hide it in drafts anyway. <br>  In the comments they asked for screenshots of correspondence with the saport.  Here <a href="">they are</a> .  For English, do not kick much.  I know that there are a lot of mistakes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115049/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115049/</a></p>
