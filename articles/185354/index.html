The decisive meeting of the Jedi of sports programming will be held in the city on the Neva due to the fact that the students of St. Petersburg ITMO took first place at ACM-ICPC 2012. <br><br>  Mail.Ru Group has been working with ITMO for a long time: our department of Internet technologies operates there, Bertrand Meyer headed the department of software engineering at the same place, we have repeatedly become partners of the stages and semifinals of ACM and jointly hold our own championship on sports programming Russian Code Cup.  Therefore, we decided to further support the ITMO team on the eve of a responsible final, and above all - talk about the champions :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>About the team</b>

      In ITMO, the work on the preparation of strong teams in the exact sciences began in the 1990s, and these were 40 students who were trained by the now well-known computer technology department.  The name of St. Petersburg University appears on the World Cup for the fourth time, and this is an absolute record. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c2/07b/ffe/1c207bffe718340de52d1a5b2734dc89.jpg"><br><br>  This year‚Äôs ITMO team consists of 3 people: Niyaz Nigmatullin, Mikhail Kever and Gennady Korotkevich. <br><br>  Misha Quever, a mathematician, entered ITMO in 2008 and, when he came to trainings, learned how to program.  Now in the personal ranking of programmers of the world, he is the 17th in the world.  This means that he is on the list of the best not only among students - among all! <br><br>  Niyaz Nigmatullin graduated from school in Kazan.  He is currently studying at the 4th ITMO course.  Participates in competitions for four years. <br><br>  In the last competitions of 2012, the guys in the team with Evgeny Kapun won first place in the ACM ICPC World Championship.  The guys received a gold medal and became world and European champions. <br><br>  This year, Eugene, two-time world champion ACM-ICPC, reached the ‚Äúchampion limit‚Äù (according to the rules, those who have twice reached the final can no longer participate in the Olympiad);  He was replaced by the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%255B%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%255D%26target_type%3Dposts">notorious</a> wunderkind and legend of sports programming, Gena Korotkevich.  A new member of the team graduated from school in Gomel.  Three times he became the absolute champion in the International Olympiad in Informatics among schoolchildren, then he entered ITMO and, as a freshman, joined Misha and Niyazu.  Now they are preparing for the World Cup together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c90/6c1/fbf/c906c1fbf01e198b0c5df85997af5934.png"><br>  <i>Gene Korotkevich in training</i> <br><br>  In ACM ICPC 2013, the guys have already managed to confirm their level once again, <a href="http://corp.mail.ru/press/news/1598">winning gold in the regional semi-final</a> . <br><br>  <b>Pro <s>Master Jedi</s> Coach</b> <br><br>  The team is prepared by Andrei Stankevich, also an Olympian, who has been engaged in coaching for 12 years.  Andrei is an associate professor at the ITMO computer technology department, winner of the Presidential Award in the field of education in the field of education, winner of the ACM-ICPC Founder's Award, winner of a special award from IBM, awarded for his successes in coaching. <br><br>  The first success was achieved under his leadership in 2003, when the team received a gold medal.  After that, in 2004, the team in Prague won first place and became world champion.  Then in 2008 and in 2009, for two years in a row, the team became the champion and, finally, in 2012, Niyaz and Misha were awarded the honorary title of the most resourceful programming specialists among students from all over the world. <br><br>  <b>Pro workouts: team work force use, <s>Luke</s></b> <br><br>  How do IT champions train?  No easier than this Olympic.  At the initial stage, the focus is on developing team spirit: it is important that participants find mutual understanding, establish interaction within the team so that they can communicate, direct each other, search for and correct mistakes.  The next step is personal cultivation. <br><br>  The team trains five hours a week.  Most often, training is an imitation of "combat conditions": it solves a set of problems from any real competition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc2/4cb/355/cc24cb35547fe8e2ba9c7440dc19d622.jpg"><br><br>  It is interesting that at the beginning of training the workouts are somewhat different from the lessons for ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù ones.  Teams are often shuffled so that participants share knowledge, find new approaches.  Another useful, but difficult to implement method - to form a team so that one of the participants was more experienced than others.  In this case, he will be able to transfer his technology, practices, teamwork techniques. <br><br>  For example, Zhenya Kapun played this role very well in a team with Misha and Niyaz last year.  At that time he was already the champion of 2012, and shared his experience and secrets with the guys.  Now the guys have changed roles and are using these methods in working with Gena - so far successfully. <br><br>  In addition to training, the team often goes to the training camp - on the road it is easier to completely disengage and immerse yourself in preparation for the competition.  In addition, at training camps where workouts are held daily, it is easier to identify and correct problems in teamwork, bottlenecks.  Another plus is that all team members live together;  accordingly, they have more opportunities to discuss among themselves methods of solving problems and exchange experience. <br><br>  The results of the championship will be known very soon.  In the meantime, we invite you to try your hand and solve <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpcnews/data/icpc2012.pdf">one of the problems</a> from the last final. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185354/</a></p>
