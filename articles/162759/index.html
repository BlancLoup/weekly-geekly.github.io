For each point, you can tap and see a pop-up balloon containing additional information about the point.  When tapes on a separate balloon opens a new activit with detailed information about this point and a piece of the map that displays only this single point. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Let's begin ... We go on <a title="Yandex MapKit repo" href="https://github.com/yandexmobile/yandexmapkit-android">github</a> and we take away library from there.  If you thought that if the library is distributed through GitHub, then it is OpenSource, then you will be disappointed.  The library is distributed as an <code>Android Library Project + jar-</code> with a bunch of obfuscated classes, which lies in the <code>libs</code> .  There is no source code, therefore, to look inside and understand that we cannot work, and sometimes we really want to, because  the documentation (in the folder with the library is <code>javadoc</code> ) is mildly bad: the description of the existing API is minimal, and many methods are not documented at all.  Therefore, the project lying next to the sample library is very useful. <br><br>  By the way, don't be intimidated by the abundance of open tasks on the githaba.  These are not necessarily bugs - this is the way to ask the community about the use of the library.  There is no forum or separate place for such issues.  Have a question?  Create an issue! <br><br>  To obtain the key, you must send a request to those.  Yandex support, and as long as it was not given to us, you can use a key like <code>1234567890</code> as a <code>debug</code> key (thanks to the sample project, not a word in the documentation).  <code>MapView</code> of keys, the first surprise awaits us here: <code>MapView</code> does not read the key from the resource file, so if you have several layouts containing inside <code>MapView</code> , you will have to copy the key to each <code>MapView</code> , <code>MapView</code> it to the configuration file and access it via <code>@string/api_key</code> will <a title="Api key issue" href="https://github.com/yandexmobile/yandexmapkit-android/issues/63">fail</a> .  This riddle took a lot of time from me, the corresponding task was created a long time ago, but as you can see, in 3 months the situation has not changed.  In general, the reaction rate of Yandex support is scary. <br><br>  So, after getting it, first of all it was decided to collect a sample-project and play with it.  The Eclipse project files are in the repository, I use IntelliJ IDEA, so the first step was to create and configure the project from existing sources.  There was a surprise waiting here - I didn‚Äôt understand until the end what was the matter, but the situation was as follows: the project compiled normally and packaged in <code>apk</code> , but then at runtime, when trying to switch to any of the activites, it fell with a <code>string resource not found</code> error ( the literal text of the error now I do not remember).  There is an empty <code>R</code> file in the library files, I would venture to suggest that the problem was that IDEA, for some reason, packed it into the final <code>apk</code> file, which led to further errors.  The problem was solved by removing the library module from the sample-project dependencies and re-adding it. <br><br>  It would seem that both libraries have similar APIs and the transition should not take too much time: <code>MapView</code> and there, <code>MapView</code> there and there, and <code>GeoPoint</code> both there and there ... But the similarities end there.  Despite the same class names, the methods are called differently and not for every method from the Google API there is its direct analogue from MapKit.  For example, in MapKit, there is no method that allows you to get the coordinates of <code>ViewPort</code> '(the visible area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe map), so you have to implement it yourself - through the transformation of screen ( <code>ScreenPoint</code> ) coordinates into global ( <code>GeoPoint</code> ) - <a title="calculating ViewPort" href="https://github.com/yandexmobile/yandexmapkit-android/issues/88">tyts</a> .  Screen coordinates should not be relative to the screen, but relative to <code>MapView</code> itself. <br><br>  On Google Maps, a balloon (pop up a twist at tap on a point) has one element along with the point itself, in MapKit it is a separate object.  Therefore, the logic of work with balloons will have to be rewritten almost completely. <br><br>  In the Google API, <code>GeoPoint</code> stores the coordinates as a pair of <code>int</code> 's - this is <code>longitude / latutude * 1E6</code> , for Yandex it is <code>double</code> longitude and latitude.  On the one hand, using <code>int</code> 's instead of <code>double</code> ' s can save a couple of bytes of memory and speed up calculations related to coordinates (integer operations are always faster than floating point operations).  On the other hand, this floods the code with constructions of the form: <code>*1E6</code> , <code>/1E6</code> .  In general, here I put the plus sign on Yandex, without constant multiplications / divisions by <code>1E6</code> with the API, it is more convenient to work, and the ratio of convenience to gain in performance, in my opinion, is not great in this situation. <br><br>  Another difficulty was the <a title="Balloons issue" href="https://github.com/yandexmobile/yandexmapkit-android/issues/83">unpredictable behavior of</a> <code>Balloon</code> 's.  The fact is that from time to time openable balloons are displayed under other <code>OverlayItem</code> 's and turn out to be blocked.  At the same time, the <code>setPriority</code> method, which all elements displayed on the map have no effect on.  As it turned out, the reason for the <code>compareTo</code> redefinition of the <code>compareTo</code> method.  This method is used when displaying a balloon to sort objects in the z-plane.  Neither the documentation nor the example contain any information about this problem, this dependence was generally established quite by chance during the experiments. <br><br>  And finally, another significant difference between Yandex MapKit and Google Maps is that MapKit does not support direct geocoding, only the reverse.  Those.  The library provides a way to convert geographic coordinates (lat / long) to an address or place name (see the <code>GeoCode</code> class).  But in the opposite direction - the street or the city is not able to coordinate, therefore, direct geocoding will have to be implemented independently, for example, using the same <a title="Yandex Maps Web API" href="">Yandex Maps Web API</a> .  Google is able to do it immediately in both directions. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say that, in general, the impression of using Yandex Maps is positive, the API is quite convenient, there were enough opportunities for my tasks, but the main drawback is documentation.  Let's hope that Yandex will put everything in order after all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162759/</a></p>
