Well, where to go, had to implement.  They made, launched, “cut the dough” and after 2 years the project began to deflate ... As a result, in 2010 it was more or less packed and successfully sold.  But the expectations placed on him, did not meet.

      Many conclusions were made for the future, there were a lot of new ideas in my head and one question: <br>  <b>“And what does it really do to make a project successful?”</b> <br><br>  With this question in May 2010 I came to work at <a href="http://glavstart.ru/">Glavstart</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having worked half a year in the company, several hundreds of the “best” projects swept in front of my eyes, most of which were falling apart right before my eyes (and many at the “brilliant idea!” Stage). <br>  As a result, I began to be much more critical of my ideas and “test them for strength” at the earliest stage, so as not to waste time and energy on their realization.  And (Oh, a miracle!), It turned out that many ideas run into the same “dead ends” in implementation, for example: <br><br>  • Lack of necessary (for successful implementation) competence in the project area of ​​its leader (or team) <br>  • “This is already there” <br>  • That's cool!  But nobody needs :) <br>  (Note. Not a word about the "money" and "communication") <br><br>  Return from the past to the present. <br><br>  This weekend the next meeting of graduates of our institute took place.  Everyone shared the news: “I work, I marry, I leave, I drink, etc., etc.” <br><br>  Of course, I also talked about my life and what I was doing the last half of the year.  To which one classmate said: <br><br>  - I have an idea for an Internet project! <br>  - What's an idea? <br>  - This is a social network! <br>  - ... <br><br>  At this interest in the project dried up) <br><br>  <b>So why is "social network not a ride?"</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Because it is already there!</b> <br><br>  Have you ever heard about “Vkontakte” and “Facebook” ??? <br><br>  <b>- “My network will be able to gather people with similar interests”</b> <br>  Hmm ... On Facebook, you can create an interest group and gather the right audience there. <br><br>  <b>- “There you can conveniently upload photos and videos!”</b> <br>  But you can post them on VKontakte!  The fact that in your network there will be a “round and beautiful” button “add video” you will not be able to entice the already established audience of the contact, which adds video with a blunt square button <br><br>  <b>- “There will be a rating !!!”</b> <br>  So what?  And if the contact tomorrow will introduce a system of "karma"?  Will your project still have competitive advantages? <br><br>  <b>“Are there profile social networks?” You say.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Yes!</b> <br><br>  But think: <br><br>  What tasks photographers solves <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> and why they can not be solved with the help of "photo album on facebook"! <br><br>  What tasks DJs solves <a href="http://pdj.ru/">promodj.ru</a> and why "playlists VKontakte" will never be able to compete with it? .. <br><br>  What are the uniqueness and competitive advantages of successful profile soc.  networks and is there such a strong advantage to your network over existing analogues? <br><br>  Anyway ... <br>  • Who? <br>  • How? <br>  • AND FOR WHAT? <br>  Does these profile networks? <br><br>  If you are still sure that your social network is going to shoot, tell me about it! <br>  Talk to the " <a href="http://moscow.startupweekend.org/archives/999">people in the subject</a> ", prove it (and yours at the same time) consistency. <br><br>  <b>"No thanks!</b>  <b>Now it will not be interesting to listen.</b>  <b>I still need to refine the idea, write a business plan, “meet people”, but then ... "</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>What to add, I'm sorry? ..</b> <br><br>  Every carrier of a “brilliant idea” is sure that his idea can be stolen / sold ... In general, it already costs money. <br><br>  If “your idea is not interesting to listen to,” then it is not only worthless ... <br>  This means that you still have to pay extra money to the audience in front of which you speak! <br><br>  Well, still think that your “social network” will become the Internet project of the year?! .. <br><br>  Time runs. <br>  Someone dreams, thinks out and writes "business plans", and someone does. <br><br>  PS I came to Glavstart with a question: <br>  <b>“And what does it really do to make a project successful?”</b> <br>  And he left a little more than half a year later with another question: <br>  <b>"What for?"</b> <br>  Why do you need it at all? .. <br><br>  Sometimes questions matter more than answers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112885/</a></p>
