  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Naive reflections on the Internet option-2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Against the background of the latest news about total surveillance on the Internet, inadequate laws on blocking in Russia and other charms, I will allow myself to put up for discussion one thought.  Nuts will be tightened the further, the stronger.  It's unavoidable.  The state will never give up the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomplete control over citizens.  And we need to do something about it.  Perhaps written below is naive, but ... <br>  Considering the fact that almost the entire Internet is now concentrated in the hands of several giants, like Google, it is almost impossible to hide from their all-seeing, and therefore from the eyes of the security services, in the modern Internet.  Below I have outlined my naive thoughts about the cause of the situation and a possible solution to the problem. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It seems to me that the main reason for this situation is that there is no independent access to the Internet.  Internet access (I mean here both the placement of your resource and the access of regular users) is provided centrally.  And fully controlled.  At one "end of the wire" providers, hosting companies are companies that are forced to work under existing laws.  And these laws, in turn, create the state, about the desires of which I wrote above.  If a company refuses to cooperate with the state, then it, regardless of whether it is a large company or a small one, simply will not allow to work and earn money - tax pressure, accusations of refusing to cooperate (breaking the law) or complicity with something bad, etc. .  I think the situation is clear.  At the other end of the line, ordinary users who are 100% identified by contracts with the provider, hosting.  Even the use of free Wi-Fi is not a panacea, since the user‚Äôs equipment (computer, laptop, tablet, phone) is still identified in one way or another. <br>  Based on this, I believe that the need for the emergence of the Internet 2 ‚Äî a truly free Internet ‚Äî is long overdue.  TOR, i2p and other anonymous networks will not work here, because  the output in them all the same goes through the same provider.  In addition, to popularize the technology, it is necessary that it be started by the average user from the ‚Äúhalf kick‚Äù, without any dances with tambourines.  Even if the state is not able to illustrate the user's traffic through the provider, it will still be able (if they want, they can actually) block it.  So, we need such an Internet, the entrance to which is bypassing the provider.  Actually, excluding any intermediary between the user and the Internet in general. <br>  I see the possibility of creating such a network based on Wi-Fi.  Each router, modern smartphone, tablet can both receive and transmit a signal.  And in cities, the concentration of such equipment is such that you can catch a signal at any time, anywhere in the city.  In fact, we already have a network at the level of iron.  It remains only to "activate" at the software level.  Create an application for stationary and mobile devices, which will integrate them all into one network, will make both clients and servers simultaneously. <br>  I will not describe the technical features of the functioning of such a network, since  I do not have enough knowledge - perhaps my thoughts will turn out to be unscientific fantasy.  In short, it seems to me that you need an application that will connect to available points and turn your own device into the same access point.  All network resources are located on the device owner or fragmented and "smeared" across multiple devices on the network.  All traffic goes to different network segments from the device to the final address ... Logically, I see an existing field from the Wi-Fi points around, I see a smartphone in front of me, which is not much inferior in performance to desktops a decade ago.  So, to organize such a network is still possible.  So why not break away once and for all from the supervision of providers and the state, not to create a truly free Internet, which would be unrealistic to block?  Yes, this network will have to go all the way of development, which the Internet has gone through - from a small space for intelligent people with simple thematic resources to the world wide web with cats.  But isn't it worth it? </div>
