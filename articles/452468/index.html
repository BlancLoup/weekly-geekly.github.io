Sensing the smell of old cooking oil, he was looking for a man in dark jeans and a blue jacket.  Olvine, who worked in IT support services, was a skinny nerd with wire glasses.  He had $ 6,000 in cash with him - he collected them, taking silver bars and coins to the pawnshop to avoid suspicion about withdrawing money from a bank account.  He found the right person in one of the booths. <br><br>  They agreed to meet on the LocalBitcoins website, where people gather who want to buy or sell cryptocurrency near their place of residence.  Olvine opened the Bitcoin Wallet application on the phone and transferred the cash, and the man scanned the QR code to transfer the bitcoins.  The transaction went smoothly.  Then Olvine returned to the car and found that the keys to it remained inside, and the door was locked. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was his birthday, he was 43, and he was supposed to meet at lunch with Michelle Woodard.  Olvine met Woodard online a few months before.  Relationships evolved rapidly, for some time they exchanged dozens of messages daily.  Since then, their passion has faded, but they still sometimes slept together.  Awaiting the arrival of a locksmith, he wrote to her that he was in a meeting to buy Bitcoins, and was late.  When the door was opened, he managed to meet with Woodard in a burger called "The Blue Door Pub", intending to spend the rest of the day with pleasure.

      That evening, he made himself another gift.  Using the email address dogdaygod@hmamail.com he wrote to one person whom he knew under the name Yura.  ‚ÄúI have bitcoins,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  Yura ran the Besa Mafia site, which worked on the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">darknet</a> and was accessible only with the help of anonymous browsers like Tor.  For the purposes of Olvain, it was important that Besa Mafia, according to her statement, had connections with the Albanian mafia and advertised the services of the killers.  On the home page of the site there was a photo of a man with a pistol and a marketing slogan: ‚ÄúIf you need to kill someone or beat them well, then you came to the right place‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/27e/346/d20/27e346d20698c488dff6ddc8b25bc98f.png"><br><br>  Yura promised that the user's money is stored on the escrow account and paid only upon completion of the work.  However, Olvine was worried that when he sent the money, they would just settle in someone's wallet.  But he wanted the statements of Jura to be true, therefore, despite the instincts, he translated the bitcoins.  ‚ÄúThey say that Besa means trust, so please justify it,‚Äù he wrote to Jura.  "For personal reasons, the explanation of which would reveal my personality, I need this bitch to be dead." <br><br>  "That bitch" was Amy Olvine, his wife. <br><br>  Stephen and Amy Olvine met 24 years earlier at Ambassadorsky University, Big Sandy (Texas) religious school.  Stephen came to the first course with a group of his friends, religious youth from Spokane (Washington).  Amy came from Minnesota and was not familiar with a large number of people in school.  She quickly became friends with the Washingtonians.  She was positive and easy-going, and he and Stephen began to dance regularly - these classes brought them together, but not too much.  They belonged to the ‚ÄúWorld Church of God‚Äù, which promoted a strict Sabbath on Saturdays, rejected the holidays of pagan origins such as Christmas, and opposed too close physical contact on the dance floor. <br><br>  In 1995, when they were still at the university, the ‚ÄúUnited Church of God‚Äù broke away from the ‚ÄúUniversal Church of God‚Äù.  Stephen and Amy went to a new sect that used the Internet to spread its doctrine.  For Stephen, who was fond of computer science, it was a logical choice. <br><br>  After college, they got married and moved to Minnesota to be closer to Amy's family.  Amy could tame the most riotous animals, and taught at a dog training school for several years before starting her own business, Active Dog Sports Training.  The couple took their adopted son and brought him home when he was only a couple of days old, after which in 2011 they moved to a house in Cottage Grove (Minnesota), an enclave of farmers and people working in other places located in the Mississippi Valley, near the Minneapolis-Saint-Paul metropolitan area.  Amy redid a large barn that was on the plot, into the dog training arena, and a cozy mess soon settled in their house, where the wool of Newfoundlands and Australian shepherd dogs covered furniture and several unfinished Lego projects in the kitchen. <br><br>  From the side everything looked normal.  Stephen rose to the rank of elder in the United Church of God, and Amy became a deaconess.  The church lived on the Jewish calendar; on Fridays, the family dined with Amy's parents, whom Stephen called mom and dad.  On Saturdays they went to the service.  Every year they traveled, attending the autumn festival of the church, which took place in different places around the world.  Amy's business grew, and she often traveled around the country with friends, attending dog competitions.  In his spare time, the family supported the Allwine.net site, where, for example, it was possible to find lists of appropriate songs and educational videos about dances, where it was shown how to have fun without touching the partner too much.  In one of the videos, Amy appears in khaki pants and hiking boots, while Stephen wears a polo shirt and loose jeans, and the couple dance to ‚ÄúWe Go Together‚Äù. <br><br>  The day after buying Bitcoins, Stephen uploaded a photo of Amy on Allwine.net.  The photo was taken while on holiday in Hawaii, and Amy has a blue-green T-shirt and a broad smile is visible on her tanned face with freckles.  Somewhere in 25 minutes after posting a photo, Stephen went to his dogdaygod email to send a link to Jura.  ‚ÄúHer height is slightly less than 1 m 70 cm, weight 91 kg,‚Äù he wrote.  He clarified that it would be best to kill her during the upcoming trip to Moulin (Illinois).  If the killer manages to make her death look like an accident - say, to drive through her Toyota Sienna minivan from the driver‚Äôs side - he will add more bitcoins. <br><br>  Yura confirmed the details of the deal shortly after the letter, using broken English.  "He will wait for her at the airport, track her by stolen car, and when the opportunity arises, arrange a fatal accident."  He added that if the accident does not succeed, the killer will shoot her.  Later, he reminded dogdaygod of the need to create an alibi for himself: ‚ÄúMake sure that most of the time you are surrounded by people, spend time in shops or other public places where there is video surveillance.‚Äù <br><br>  Usually Stephen was not surrounded by people.  She and Amy lived on a plot of 11 acres located in a dead end street.  The house was a simple one-story portable building set on a foundation.  It had four bedrooms, a spacious living room and an open kitchen.  Stephen equipped the roof with solar panels and boasted that they gave so much energy that he could pump it back into the network.  Most of the time he spent in the office in the basement, correcting glitches in the call center system.  At home, he could work two jobs at once - one was at the IT company Optanix, the other at the insurance company Cigna.  Employees often turned to him with particularly difficult problems. <br><br>  The pastor, whom the Olvains went to, preached abstention from carnal desires, and Stephen himself consulted couples from his congregation who had problems with marriage.  However, remaining alone, he allowed himself to dream, and went to sites like Naughtydates.com and LonelyMILFs.com.  On a closed website Backpage, he picked up a girl from the escort service, and went to Iowa twice to have sex with her.  During the consultation process, he learned about the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/383389/">Ashley Madison</a> dating site, designed for married people.  There he met Michelle Woodard. <br><br>  On the first date, Stephen accompanied Woodard during her visit to the doctor.  For several weeks she traveled with him on working trips.  Woodard liked how unusually calm Stephen was.  One day their connecting flight from Philadelphia was canceled.  At 8 am, Stephen met in Hatrford (Connecticut), and he rented a car without any scandals, on which they drove the remaining 130 km. <br><br>  A month before Stephen "ordered" his wife, he told Woodard that he would try to improve relations with Amy.  In fact, his intrigue only strengthened his desire for a new life. <br><br>  Theoretically, with his discipline and computer skills, Stephen was the perfect offender for the darkweb.  He covered his tracks with anonymous remailers, which remove identification information from messages, and Tor, masking the IP address by transferring data along a random path through a network of anonymous nodes.  He came up with a difficult background: allegedly, dogdaygod was a rival dog trainer, and wanted to kill Amy because she slept with her husband.  To create his virtual personality in a darkweb, he transferred his infidelity to his wife. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c20/284/346/c202843460ba251152594b5ced2c447f.jpg"><br>  <i>Members of the United Church of God met at a local Methodist church</i> <br><br>  Stephen scheduled the kill for the weekend, March 19, when Amy was supposed to be in Moulin in a dog training competition.  But by the end of the weekend, he wrote a letter to Jura with a complaint that he had not received any news of her death.  Yura explained that the killer had not yet caught a convenient moment: ‚ÄúHe needs to arrange everything so as to hit her car from the driver‚Äôs side, hold a side collision to guarantee death‚Äù.  The administrator of Besa Mafia seemed to understand that it was important for dogdaygod that Amy be killed on the road.  ‚ÄúWe are not interested in why people are being killed,‚Äù he wrote.  ‚ÄúBut if she is your wife or family member, we can do it in your city,‚Äù he said, adding that the client can leave the city on the appointed day.  He offered to kill Amy at home and agreed that after that it would be possible to burn the house for an additional 10 bitcoins, or $ 4,100. <br><br>  "Not a wife," answered Stephen, "but the same thought came to my mind."  The next day he collected money.  When he sent bitcoins to Besa Mafia, the page was refreshed, and he did not recognize the 34-character code that appeared.  In a panic, he was worried that the cryptocurrency, on which he had worked so hard, would disappear without a trace.  He quickly copied the code and saved it in the notes on the iPhone, and then sent the code to Jura in a letter with the theme ‚ÄúHELP!‚Äù.  In less than a minute, he deleted the code from the notes. <br><br>  A few hours later, Yura replied, assuring that the transaction was successful, but the days went by and nothing happened.  In the weeks that followed, Stephen's messages sent to Juray ran from faintly disappointed to very detailed instructions.  ‚ÄúI know that her husband has a big tractor, so she must have gas canisters in her garage,‚Äù he wrote.  "But eliminate it only, do not touch the father and the child."  Yura, as if he was a helpful devil, responded with messages that strengthened the mood of the client.  "Yes, she really is a bitch, and deserves to die," he wrote.  After an hour and a half, he added: ‚ÄúKeep in mind that 80% of our killers are members of gangs involved in drug trafficking, beating people, and sometimes murder.‚Äù  For an additional fee, dogdaygod could have ordered the execution of a more experienced killer - a former Chechen sniper. <br><br>  Stephen spent at least $ 12,000 on a venture with a hitman. Instead of giving up or thinking about his fall, he only became even more goal-oriented.  He signed up on the Darkweb Marketplace Dream Market, better known for drug trafficking, where you could choose other methods of murder.  Common sense spoke of the need to use different user names, but he again used the name dogdaygod, as if he had already become a character invented by him.  He had to beat off his expenses: the payment on Amy's insurance was $ 700,000. <br><br>  In April 2016, about two months after Stephen first ‚Äúordered‚Äù his wife, <a href="https://xakep.ru/2016/05/13/besa-mafia/">Besa Mafia was hacked</a> and Jura's correspondence with customers ‚Äî including dogdaygod ‚Äî was unloaded on pastebin.  From the data it became known that users with nicknames like Killerman and kkkcolsia were paid tens of thousands of dollars in bitcoins for killing people in Australia, Canada, Turkey and the United States.  Soon, these orders hit the FBI, and the agency sent orders to local offices to contact the alleged victims.  FBI Special Agent Escher Silky, who worked in an office in Minneapolis, found out that someone called dogdaygod wanted Amy Olvine to die.  He was instructed to warn her about the threat. <br><br>  On Tuesday, immediately after the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_(%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590)">Day of Remembrance</a> , Silki enlisted the help of Terry Raymond, a local police officer, and together they drove to the Olvayn's house.  Cottage Grove is a quiet suburb for wealthy people, but, as well as throughout the country, local police have increasingly reported online threats.  Raymond, a reticent man with angular features, underlined trimmed beard, served in the police for 13 years, and was a specialist in computer crime. <br><br>  When Silky and Raymond arrived, Stephen Allvine invited them in.  He told the two law enforcement officers that Amy was not at home, and they silently stood in the room while he called her on the phone.  Stephen seemed to Raymond to be an awkward person feeling in the presence of others, but he did not attach any importance to this.  In his work had to deal with everyone. <br><br>  The police returned to the station, and Amy soon arrived.  They met in the lobby, where there was an oil painting depicting the service dog of the office, Blitz, and took her to the interrogation room, where there was almost no furniture.  As the FBI led the investigation, Raymond mostly listened, and Silky explained to Amy that someone who knows her travel schedule and daily habits wants her dead.  Amy was amazed.  She got even more confused when Silky mentioned the accusations that Amy was sleeping with her trainer's husband.  She could not understand who could consider her an enemy.  ‚ÄúIf you notice something suspicious, give us a call,‚Äù Raymond told her goodbye. <br><br>  A few weeks later, Olvains installed a video surveillance system with motion sensors in their homes, and installed cameras at different entrances.  Stephen bought a gun, Springfield XDS 9 mm.  She and Amy decided to keep him on her side of the bed, and went to the shooting gallery as a date. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b57/cf8/302/b57cf8302a2d92eb846e4fb323ea92a4.jpg"><br>  <i>Police Cottage Grove, from left to right: captains Gwen Martin and Randy McAllister, detectives Terry Raymond and Jared Landkamer</i> <br><br>  On July 31, Amy called Silka in confusion: over the past week, she received two anonymous threats by email.  Silky arrived at the Olvines' home, where Stephen printed these emails and listened to Amy explaining to the agents what had happened. <br><br>  The first letter came from an anonymous remailer from Austria.  There, in particular, was the following: <br><br>  Amy, I still blame you for ruining my life.  I see that you installed a security system, and people on the Internet told me that the police were interested in my previous letters.  I was assured that the letters could not be traced, and that they would not find me, but I could not attack you directly while you were being watched. <br><br>  And so what will happen next.  Since I cannot reach you, I will get to all that is dear to you. <br><br>  The email listed the contacts of Amy's relatives based on information available through Radaris.com, which provides subscribers with contact information about individuals and organizations.  The author also pointed out details known only to close people of Amy - the location of the gas meter on the Olvayn‚Äôs house, that they changed the place where they put their SUV, the color of the T-shirt that their son wore two days ago.  ‚ÄúThis is how you can save your family,‚Äù was written in the letter.  ‚ÄúCommit suicide.‚Äù  Next, the author listed various suitable methods. <br><br>  A week later came the second anonymous letter, where she was scolded for the fact that she did not follow the recommendations.  ‚ÄúAre you so selfish that you are ready to put your families at [sic] risk?‚Äù <br><br>  Amy gave her computer to the cops, hoping that its contents would help the agents track down her potential killer.  Stephen gave the agents his laptop and smartphone.  The FBI made copies of devices, including applications, processes, and files, and returned them after a couple of days. <br><br>  Amy gave Silky the names of the people who trained in her arena, the owners of the animals with whom she worked, her best friend.  The agent interviewed four of them and examined the credit histories of several of them.  Very few people benefited from Amy‚Äôs death, however, since dogdaygod paid several thousand dollars to kill her, a personal motive was involved in the matter.  Moreover, the customer gave Yura instructions not to kill her husband.  It was logical as a result to investigate the spouse.  Silky interrogated Stephen, but it is unclear whether he did anything else besides this and a copy of his computer with a telephone.  The FBI declined to comment on this incident, and the Cottage Grove police knew little about the work of the bureau.  In addition, to bring Raymond along for the first interrogation and send him copies of threatening emails, the bureau no longer engaged the local police. <br><br>  Meanwhile, Amy was trying to cope with terrible threats.  She enrolled in the Civil Academy courses where citizens are told in detail about the work of the police department.  In her statement, she wrote that she ‚Äúwants to know about the work of the police department, about what they do and how everything works there.‚Äù<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sergeant Gwen Martin, leading the course, did not know about the life threats received by Amy, and Amy herself did not share this with anyone from the other participants while they were training in the dash and took fingerprints from a soda can. Amy asked to be attached to a K-9 employee [work with service dogs; by consonance K-9 / canine - dog / approx. transl.] in his patrol, and with great enthusiasm talked about how the policeman shared with her advice on the education of dogs and training for taking a trail. At the end of the program, she noted this with the rest of the group with a small party.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, Amy still felt helpless. Periodic headaches became more frequent, she started having problems with memory. While teaching, she acted confidently, but she was worried that her aggressor might be among her students. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One summer evening she sat in the yard with her sister and thought about who was responsible for the gloomy atmosphere that enveloped her life. Many years ago, when her sister started college, Amy sent her postcards every week so that she would not miss home. Now her sister, in response, took up the same thing and quoted the Bible in each card.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One afternoon on Saturday, in November, Stephen and Amy went to church with their son. The road went through the floodplain to the east of the Mississippi, through the yellowing farm fields, areas littered with auto parts and ravines, overgrown with trees that had already dropped the foliage. The United Church of God rented a room in a red brick building from a local congregation of Methodists. There was something befitting a moment in the asceticism of the environment, as if the devil could be contained by only architectural minimalism.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the chapel, the family sat together with men in jackets, women in modest dresses and children with recently brushed hair. Pastor Brian Shaw, standing in the light of daylight, making his way through the glass roof, recited a warning from the New Testament about people who have "eyes full of love and unceasing sin." He spoke of Job, who did not train to look at women with lust. The price paid for the fact that a person does not follow Job‚Äôs example is serious: ‚ÄúWhen we do not control our sinful nature, it controls us.‚Äù</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On Sunday, Stephen woke up shortly before 6 am, as usual, and went down to his office in the basement, where he logged into the Optanix system to start work. At noon, he went upstairs to have lunch with Amy and her son. Amy, like an avid cook, baked a piece of pumpkin in a quiet cooker, which remained after the dessert she made a couple of days ago. Soon after, she felt weak and dizzy. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Amy's father came to her to install a dog door in the garage. Stephen told him that Amy was bad, and she was resting in the bedroom. Her father left without seeing her. Five minutes after his departure, Stephen called him and asked him to return, take his grandson, because he allegedly wanted to take Amy to the clinic.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At dusk, Stephen went to refuel, took the boy from his wife's parents and took him to the Culvers family restaurant. It was their Sunday tradition ‚Äî dinner at Culvers, while Amy was teaching in dog training courses. They sat in a brightly lit room, eating chicken and smoked cheese. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Upon returning home, the boy jumped out of the minivan and ran into the house, into the parents' bedroom. There, in an unnatural posture, lay the body of Amy, and a pool of blood accumulated around her head. Near lay Springfield XDS 9 mm. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stephen called 911. ‚ÄúI think my wife shot herself,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere's a lot of blood here.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d56/fcd/db4/d56fcddb4c35edfceb187bb861008cb4.jpg"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Town Hall Cottage Grove, where the police station is located</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sergeant Gwen Martin arrived at the house a few minutes after calling 911. When she saw Amy's body on the floor, she remembered how she taught her on the program of the ‚ÄúCivil Academy‚Äù and burst into tears. Another sergeant took over, and Martin returned to the car. Having mastered herself, she turned to the laptop on the panel and launched a search for calls to the police at this address. She was amazed to find a report in which Terry Raymond described the threats to Amy‚Äôs life from a darkweb. Martin picked up the phone and called Detective Randy Macalister, who was in charge of the investigations at Cottage Grove.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">McAllister was the 47-year-old owner of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle and a little childish face. He often participated in office sweepstakes. On his coffee mug it was written "because of the confidentiality of my work, I have no idea what I'm doing." However, his cheerful behavior hid the meticulous nature. About ten years ago, McAllister was investigating a murder in a nearby city; his wife‚Äôs former partner killed a married couple in their home while their children hid in the house. Shortly before, the woman told the police that her jealous ex had contacted her in violation of a court order. McAllister was disappointed that the system could not help that woman, and began his own program to protect potential victims from stalking and directed violence. Hearing Raymond mention the threats Amy received from the darkweb,he suggested comparing them with the database of threats stored in the FBI's behavioral analysis department; this could help them compile a profile of a potential intruder. But he had no authority in this case.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now he was in a hurry to the Olvayn's house. Entering through the garage, he immediately felt the smell of cooking pumpkin from a quiet cooker. It seemed strange to him; usually people don't start cooking food before they kill themselves. There were other inconsistencies: bloody marks on both sides of the bedroom door. And although the floor in the hallway was covered with dog hair, it was clean in the adjacent hall.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">While McAllister was waiting for the arrival of the forensic scientist and criminal investigators, the police officer took Stephen and his son to the station. Raymond took Stephen to the same interrogation room, where he and Silky met Amy five months ago while his colleague looked after the boy in the rest room. Raymond took out a pair of latex gloves and took a smear from Stephen's mouth for a DNA test. ‚ÄúAnd will you take this from your wife‚Äôs parents too?‚Äù Asked Stephen. ‚ÄúNo, only you and your son,‚Äù said Raymond. He asked Stephen to tell how he spent the day.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stephen collaborated with the policeman, but it seemed to Raymond that he behaved somehow unnaturally for a man who had just lost his wife. He reminded the detective that Amy had a file at the FBI; he said her computer was behaving strangely. ‚ÄúI, as a representative of the IT industry, are annoyed because I know how everything should work in the legal world, he said, and added:‚Äú I don‚Äôt know anything about hacking and other things like that. ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the next three days, investigators combed the scene of the crime. Technologists sprayed luminol on the floor and turned off the light. Where luminol interacted with blood or purifiers, it glowed bright blue. The glow showed that the corridor was cleaned. He also highlighted several tracks that went into the bedroom from the laundry room and back.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Police Cottage Grove executed a search warrant for the house. McAllister sat down at the table in the dining room, and rewrote evidence. Raymond went down to Stephen's study in the basement. When he entered, he saw that all the surfaces were filled with rubbish: folders, tangled wires, external drives, SD-cards, as well as a voice recorder and Fitbit. There were hard drives of the kind that had not been used for ten years. Three monitors and a MacBook Pro stood on Stephen‚Äôs desk ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt the same computer that he gave to the FBI. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The police dragged the booty to the top, and then in turn gave it to Macalister for logging. Damn it, he thought as he watched the equipment pile up. And then "oh my God, how much is possible." However, all devices arrived and arrived. In total there were sixty-six.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the crime was related to death in the city, the investigation was conducted by the Cottage Grove Police Department. Two and a half weeks after Amy‚Äôs death, the FBI sent her a file. Opening the documents, McAllister and Raymond saw - for the first time - a complete correspondence with Besa Mafia. It was then that they learned that the nickname of the person who wanted Amy‚Äôs death was dogdaygod.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By that time, Stephen was already among the suspects, but there was no evidence linking him to the murder. The fact that his DNA was everywhere was hardly surprising: it was his home. The video from the security system was not unusual, although the recordings were incomplete. Stephen explained that he and Amy did not turn on the camera above the sliding glass door, because their dogs constantly passed through it. McAllister was hoping to find the answers in the devices brought by Raymond from the Olvayn cellar.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As soon as the Besa Mafia files appeared in pastebin, the bloggers immediately decided that the site was fraudulent. One by one, Yura's clients complained that the killings they ordered were not carried out. However, McAllister did not want to take anything for granted. He and Detective Jared Landkamer identified ten other targets from Besa Mafia orders in the United States and contacted police stations at their place of residence. This could give them new leads in their case, or perhaps save other lives.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">McAllister distributed work with electronics. He sent computers to a forensic specialist at a nearby police station. Landkamer received judicial permission to access the Olvayn emails - and spent many days reading them. Raymond began by extracting data from Stephen‚Äôs phones. In a room without windows, where service monitors were lined up along the walls, he ran software that sorted data ‚Äî there were applications, there was call history ‚Äî and a reconstructed timeline of devices. On the phone, which Stephen gave the FBI to make a copy of, Raymond found Orfox and Orbot, needed to access the Tor network. He also found text messages that contained confirmation codes from the LocalBitcoins website. Either the FBI missed them, or did not attach importance.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Checking Amy's phone, he saw that on the day of her death her mind gradually became more confused. At 13:48 she went to the Wikipedia page about dizziness. At 13:49 she wrote the word DUY in a search engine. Then after a minute EYE. Then DIY VWHH. It looked like she was desperately trying to understand why the room was spinning around her, but could not write words in a search engine.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the interrogation of state investigator, Stephen confessed to his affair with Woodard. Raymond found Michelle's contact on Stephen‚Äôs phone, and when investigators interviewed Woodard, she told them about dinner on her birthday, when Stephen wrote to her that she had locked the keys in the car, buying bitcoins. Steven‚Äôs call history confirmed that he called roadside assistance that day from Vendis in Minneapolis. The detectives used text messages with verification codes to find his account on LocalBitcoins. This led them to correspond with the seller about the exchange of $ 6000. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Stephen's devices, Landkamer found additional emails from which the user names became known, under which he entered Backpage and LonelyMILFS.com. This in itself was not a crime, but spoke of a possible motive.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hiding most of the criminal activity, Stephen did not delete the search history. On February 16, a few minutes before the first sentence from dogdaygod, to kill Amy in Moline, Stephen searched Google for ‚Äúmoline il‚Äù on his MacBook Pro. A day later, he studied their insurance. In July, shortly before Amy received her first email with threats, where contacts from the Radaris site were listed, he visited the pages of this site that were appropriate for her family members.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Cottage Grove, murders were rare, and detectives, faced with circumstantial evidence and the dodgy nature of the darkweb, were greatly impressed with this affair. One evening, lying in bed after reading the file from the FBI to Amy, Landkamer looked in Google for dogdaygod. After seeing the results, he called his wife. The search engine indexed several pages from the site of Dream Market, an online drug store in a darkweb. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Landkamer immediately sent a message about the findings to Macalister. McAllister launched Tor and opened a conversation with the Dream Market. In one branch, dogdaygod asked if anyone had </font><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">scopolamine</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> for sale.</font></font><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, powerful medication. McAllister worked as a medical assistant, so he knew that scopolamine was prescribed for motion sickness, but he could also make people compliant and cause amnesia, for which he received the nickname ‚ÄúDevil's Breath‚Äù. Scrolling through the pages, he came across a comment from a user who decided that dogdaygod wanted to use scopolamine for personal entertainment. ‚ÄúThe seller is there,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúbut better go for this shit, mate. It is a dangerous kapets, and you can kill someone. ‚Äù</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later, when analyzing the contents of Amy's stomach, scopolamine was confirmed. However, the most valuable evidence was obtained thanks to the peculiarities of making safety copies of Apple devices. A court IT specialist from a neighboring site found a message containing a Bitcoin address in Stephen‚Äôs MacBook Pro archives and appeared on his iPhone in March 2016. It happened 23 seconds before dogdaygod wrote the same 34-digit wallet code. 40 seconds after sending the message to Jura, the message from Stephen's phone was deleted. But the deleted file does not disappear until other files take its place. A few months later, when Stephen backed up his phone via iTunes, an important story was preserved on the laptop.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">McAllister exulted. Detectives linked the offline identity of Stephen, a church elder concerned about the acceptability of the dance steps, with the online ones being don Juan and a failed potential killer. The tempting anonymity of Darkweb, which prompted Stephen to crime, gave him a feeling of omnipotence. He could not understand that this ability was not transmitted to the normal web and to the real world. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/532/525/324/532525324ea6206fbc41f27d4aea5424.jpg"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now Steven Olvine is imprisoned in the Minnesota prison in Oak-Park Heights.</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The trial of Stephen Olvine lasted eight days. District prosecutors presented a number of bright witnesses: a pawnshop manager, where Stephen was selling silver, an Iowa escort employee from Backpage, and Woodard. McAllister showed the murder weapon in court, and Jared Landkamer explained to the court the meaning of the abbreviation MILF, which later became an endless occasion for jokes at the police station. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Prosecutors Fred Fink and Jamie Krauser used the evidence to build a theory: Stephen poisoned Amy with a large dose of scopolamine to either kill her or immobilize her. But, although her head was spinning and she felt bad, she did not die. So Stephen shot her with their gun in the hallway. Then he transferred the body to the bedroom and washed away the blood. When he went to the gas station and drove his son to the Culvers, he kept his checks just in case.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The jury conferred for six hours, and then found Stephen guilty. On February 2, he was brought to the courtroom to announce the verdict. Each of his family members and friends who were present told the judge how much Amy meant to them. Then Stephen rose to appeal to the court. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Breathing hard, he tried to reject the technical evidence related to file backups and bitcoin wallets. Then he switched to his spiritual virtues. In the prison, where he was held for the duration of the trial, he preached to drug addicts and child molesters. He said that he had converted at least three unbelievers.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúMr. Olwein,‚Äù the judge said after listening to his statement, ‚Äúmy feelings will not change the sentence in this matter.‚Äù But according to my feelings, you are an incredible actor. You can cause tears and stop them. You are a hypocrite and a cold man. ‚Äù The judge sentenced him to life imprisonment without parole (now the case is sent to the appellate court). From the next room, McAllister watched Raymond and Landkamer through the window, listening to the defendant‚Äôs reprimand with satisfaction. However, his feelings were clouded. McAllister understood why during the FBI investigation in the darkweb, Stephen could not arouse suspicion. Stephen's relationship with Amy seemed happy, they had no history of violence or the use of illegal drugs. He knew that retroactive judgment could influence the investigators' conclusions, but he also had a feelingthat Amy's death could have been prevented. Threat experts use a four-point list to assess the likelihood that an anonymous villain is a close victim. In the case of Amy, all four were fulfilled: the person followed her movements, apparently lived nearby, knew her habits and plans for the future, and spoke of her with disgust or contempt.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Within a few months after the trial, Macalister was promoted to captain. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He periodically advises police stations on darkweb crimes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No other deaths were associated with Besa Mafia‚Äôs customers, however, Jura, as reported, opened other fraudulent sites allegedly related to contract killings: Crime Bay, Sicilian Hitmen, Cosa Nostra. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seemed that Yura was a devil, watching from afar, and grinning at how the seeds thrown by him rose and turned into full-fledged evil.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452468/</a></p>
