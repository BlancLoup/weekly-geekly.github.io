In the comments of the third and subsequent levels we discuss the answer.

      In the course of the discussion, the question and the answers are summarized and are placed in the text of the topic with an indication of the questioner and the respondent. <br><br>  Example <br>  <b>Question</b> <blockquote>  I want to be a candidate of science.  Where to find out all this? </blockquote><br>  <b>Answer</b> <blockquote>  In Russia, everything related to dissertations is regulated by the Higher Attestation Commission (HAC), which is part of the structure of the Ministry of Education and Science.  On the official website of this organization published a thesis on the protection of theses.  This is the bible for the dissertation writer, scholar and technical secretary of the dissertation council and its members (although they are less interested in formalities).  Here is the link: <a href="http://vak.ed.gov.ru/ru/docs/%3Fid4%3D135%26i4%3D4">vak.ed.gov.ru/ru/docs/?id4=135&amp;i4=4</a> <br><br>  If you already know what topic or specialty you will be writing, you need to decide on a leader. <br>  There is a good saying: candidates write doctors, doctors - candidates.  This is in many ways.  The head gives the main impetus to your work, with a bad, non-initiative, non-penetrating, conflict leader you will be much more difficult. <br><br>  Together with the manager, decide on the topic (at least approximately) and future advice.  Then you have a direct path to the department of postgraduate and doctoral studies of an educational institution, where you will be a graduate student or applicant. <br><br>  Often they make you act in one specialty, and defend yourself in another, in another council or even in a city.  This, as a rule, does not present a special problem: you must take the exam in a new specialty and test the ground in that council where you will go. <br><br>  As a rule, all scientists and technical secretaries of the DS are people very sane and competent, and you will need to turn to them when the dissertation looms on the horizon. </blockquote><br>  Another example: <br>  <b>Question</b> <blockquote>  What is actually being done to write a dissertation?  What is the main job? </blockquote><br>  <b>Answer</b> <blockquote>  Everything is simple and difficult at the same time. <br>  The general line of conduct is as follows: <br>  1. You must understand the topic and all that directly concerns it, better than all your listeners.  You should be supercompetent in what you do.  Usually for this candidates ultimately narrow the topic, and this is normal. <br>  2. You must solve some applied and / or scientific problem with the application of your knowledge and skills, prove that the solution is found, and it is better known counterparts. <br>  3. You must write and defend a thesis.  The essence of protection is upholding your decision and proof of its importance and scientific novelty. <br><br>  For this postgraduate student / applicant: <br>  1. Studying literature <br>  2. Set experiments <br>  3. Writes reviews, articles, theses.  (It is necessary to write at least 1 article in the so-called "Vakovsky" magazine). <br>  4. Speaks at conferences, seminars. <br>  5. Participates in any grant competitions and so on.  This is optional, but useful. <br><br>  With proper construction of the process, in 1-2 years you will have the backbone of the work.  From this point, at least 3-4 months you can defend.  Most often, these terms are twice as long. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50357/</a></p>
