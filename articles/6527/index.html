It is not necessary to buy hi-end'nye, which means expensive, speaker systems.  After all, we are not music lovers, we just love to listen to high-quality music! <br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Decide what kind of bass you need</b> <br>  If you want to get bass, which can be heard in nightclubs, the recipe is simple.  Put your speakers on the floor in the corners of the room, unscrew the bass tone of the amplifier to maximum and enjoy the muddy bass, because of which you can not hear the music.  I do not like?  Clear.  Powerful low frequencies are good, but quality is no less important than quantity. <br>  <b>Carefully select the system</b> <br>  Each element in your kit influences the sound and the perception of the low frequencies, so choose wisely: amplifiers, sources and cables - everything is important.  Reviews will help you to determine the products with the best low-frequency capabilities, but be sure to listen to the entire system to make sure that the components are compatible. <br>  <b>Especially carefully choose the speakers</b> <br>  Small speakers in a large room will not provide the desired bass depth, and, conversely, large speakers in a small room may produce excessive and uncontrollable bass.  Remember that good shelf speakers when installed on high-quality racks transmit the woofer more collected and faster than most low-cost outdoor speakers.  However, very deep bass still requires good napols. <br>  <b>Correctly install the speakers.</b> <br>  The acoustics of your room are unique, so take the time to look for a place for the speakers.  Of course, the decor and aesthetic considerations limit the choice, but even with relatively small movements of the speakers, the sound can vary greatly. <br>  <b>Pay attention to phase inverter</b> <br>  The vast majority of speakers use a phase inverter to enhance the bottom.  If the phase inverter ports are located in the back, do not put them too close to the wall, otherwise they will sound booming and bloated. Even with small movements of the speakers in the room, the sound can change dramatically. <br>  <b>Do not forget about accessories</b> <br>  A good equipment stand will help improve the speed and weight of the low frequencies, and high-quality stands for bookshelf speakers are simply necessary.  Ensure all nuts, bolts, and studs are tight.  Finally, new network cables will make the sound more dense. <br>  <b>Buy a subwoofer</b> <br>  If you still lack low-frequency persuasiveness, the output can be a separate bass radiator - a good one, of course.  And for a cinema system, a subwoofer is more obligatory than desirable. <br>  <b>Again about subwoofers</b> <br>  Devices designed for Hi-Fi, must have good rhythm, so as not to disrupt the pace of music.  There will be no special problems with the depth of the bass, so first of all pay attention to the tempo and speed of the sound transmission. <br>  <b>And again about the subwoofers</b> <br>  Multichannel systems have different needs - rhythm, of course, is important, but for many soundtracks, powerful deep bass and outstanding dynamic abilities of a good subwoofer are needed.  So assess the depth and energy, as well as good coordination with the rest of the AU. <br>  <b>Division of labor</b> <br>  What is better than one subwoofer?  That's right - two subwoofers.  The separation of the low-frequency signal between the two devices makes the localization of the source of the bass in the room less distinct.  In some systems, it is possible to use subwoofers in stereo, which facilitates their coordination with speakers. <br><br>  Source <a href="http://www.whathifi.ru/" title="Sound and Video, October / 2006">Sound and Video, October / 2006</a> </div>
