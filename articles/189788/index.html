  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The basis of AI - the structure of the mind</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In fact, the reverse-engineering of the intellect, performed by the intellect itself, is psychology - the desire to understand what consciousness is, mind, psyche, intellect, all these are synonyms of the thinking system. <br><br>  The terminology of psychology is inaccurate and controversial, so you need to clarify or redefine terms.  Also in the field of study includes linguistics and programming.  Knowledge of linguistics can help create a universal logical language for the presentation and processing of any information.  The same logical language programs the entire logical system, and separately efficient pattern recognition without delay. <br><br>  CPU and GPU can be compared with the functional asymmetry of the human brain - logical and figurative thought processes are clearly distinguishable.  Therefore, we should especially note the remarkable technology of CUDA - we can say that only now is the right time to create AI, even at home. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      If you rethink the classical scheme of the structure of the psyche by V. A. Ganzen, then you get a well-forgotten old: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca4/b7f/40a/ca4b7f40a8d187b961ea947b6b2b3cd8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Further interpretation of the scheme with the adaptation of terminology for programmers. <br><br>  Intellect, as a program running on a biological computer, consists of four main processes - <br>  <b>Attention and Memory, Activity and Response.</b> <br>  All these processes operate continuously, with a break for sleep. <br>  Activity is governed by feedback from Response.  Attention uses Memory. <br>  Activity is consciousness of arbitrariness - the opposite of the reactivity of the unconsciousness of involuntariness. <br><br>  Constructively, this scheme corresponds to the four-petal circle of Muladhara, the ‚Äúroot‚Äù of human consciousness in traditional Indian psychology, located in the ‚Äútail‚Äù of the spinal cord. <br><br>  The four main processes are interconnected in a circle in a circle, forming pair functions at the junctions - <br>  <b>Speech, Presentation, Perception, Sensation, Emotions, Feelings, Motivation, Action.</b> <br>  For ease of understanding, functions are grouped in pairs ‚Äî will (MD), thinking (RP), perception (OM), and affect (SE). <br>  Functions are interrelated and use the results of each other's work. <br><br>  Attention explores objects consciously and unconsciously.  Attention is at the heart of Motivation and Feelings; Action and Emotions are also controlled by Attention.  The active part of Attention is Motivation and Action, the reactive part of Attention is Feelings and Emotions. <br>  <b>Motivation</b> is a conscious active goal-setting, reasoning, decision-making, the formulation of a logical problem and finding a solution, planning, motivation, intention, etc.  The rules of behavior and data about the situation are used, that is, Representation, Feelings (for example, hunger or interest) are also used. <br>  <b>Feelings</b> are automatic unconscious Response of Attention to objects using analyzers (sense organs) and Emotions, this is also foreboding-intuition. <br>  (here objects are any objects or phenomena, from the real world or fictional). <br><br>  Emotions and Sensations are the main part of the Response, Feelings and Perceptions also work in the automatic-unconscious mode. <br>  <b>Emotions</b> are an evaluative reaction of Attentions to objects, these are impressions, an emotional relation to an object, a mood (emotional state), an experience. <br>  <b>Sensation</b> is a distinction between the properties of objects, its distinguishable parts. <br><br>  Perception and Presentation is the main part of Memory - reading and writing data, also Speech and Sensation use Memory. <br>  <b>Perception</b> is an unconscious automatic recognition (detection, identification) of whole images, and the recording of the received data in memory. <br>  That is, for any images there is a single suitable data format. <br>  <b>A representation</b> is a reproduction of a reproduction of an image from memory, and imagination. <br><br>  Activity is mainly physical Actions and Speech, also active-conscious Motivation and Presentation. <br>  <b>Speech</b> is an information exchange between intellects and the preservation of knowledge on a physical medium. <br>  <b>Action</b> is the realization of Motivation, or the execution of a speech command from a different intelligence. <br>  Actions provide data for ‚Äúmotor attention‚Äù. <br><br>  Speech and Presentation is so-called.  ‚ÄúThe second signal system‚Äù, not all intellects possess it.  Sign language which monkeys are able to own is also Speech.  For monkeys, this scheme will be the same - at the level of the root of Muladhara, man is a beast. <br><br>  And a little more reasoning. <br><br>  Sleep is separate from the main mode of the brain, with a possibly undesirable side effect in the form of dreams.  In sleep mode, the brain department providing Attention should rest, and the mind changes uncontrollably if Attention does not fall asleep due to stress, arousal, etc. <br><br>  This program architecture allows the possibility of granting the right to make decisions to an external Observer, through the interface of the Motivation function.  The Observer-Soul can only do with a simple ‚Äúswitch‚Äù yes / no.  Structurally, this corresponds to the two-petal circle of Ajna (which means the Order), located in the hemispheres of the brain.  Man's ability to distinguish good from evil is Ajna. <br><br>  Probably it is impossible to fully recreate in the car Feelings and Emotions, because it requires a feeling flesh, a living body, a feeling environment around itself and within itself, feeling even unity and harmony with the outside world. <br><br>  Excluding or simplifying the process of automatic unconscious Response gives an intelligent machine a very much superior logical computing capability of a person.  Such a human Exointelect does not make important decisions on its own, because without a full-fledged Emotion function it is impossible to evaluate some very important objects of the human world.  Such a tool is beautifully depicted in the film ‚ÄúSea Battle‚Äù.  Exointelligence and exoskeleton will allow a person to focus on the important and interesting, for example, on creativity and intuition, on the game, entrusting logic-mathematics and heavy mechanics to the machine. <br><br>  You can call a person a designed biological mechanism, then there is the possibility of the existence of Engineers who design various classes of thinking machines.  And if we assume that the human mind is their "image and likeness", then it follows that the human mind contains some similar part of the device of the mind of the Creator of man.  And according to the same Indian psychology, outside the human body there is usually the Unused Higher Circle Thousand-Petal - that is, man probably differs from other higher animals in that it has a special interface for the Engineers who built these machines, either for a reasonable mechanism called Karma or Fate ... <br><br>  So simply and beautifully arranged the mind of man.  Defined the basic concepts of architecture. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189788/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189788/</a></p>
