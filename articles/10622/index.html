      The most famous people of the planet do not want to talk about their personal lives and their life.  But they cannot hide from the all-seeing eye of the Google Maps satellite: their houses will be shown to the whole world! <br><br>  The most interesting was the <strong><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps%3Ft%3Dh%26key%3DABQIAAAAMtXhMjCwEozE5aV6DB6nfxRDj-kFzAoASnnb3lNRXX6ECc8T0xT_YCkeGydzDN_ID3iAC2c-XmYSqQ%26ie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D47.627652,-122.2424%26spn%3D0.001242,0.001955%26z%3D19%26om%3D1">house of Bill Gates</a></strong> ( <em>47.627652, -122.2424</em> ).  There is something pastoral in this cluster of modest-looking low-rise wooden buildings.  In fact, inside the house is equipped not only with the latter, but downright with the as-yet-spoken technology.  This is truly the home of the future!  In the house of Gates is a huge database in which there are pictures, melodies and movies for every taste.  This residential complex has a cinema, several golf courses, a marina, a 20-meter swimming pool with underwater music and much more.  Bill himself has a favorite place in his domain - an extensive library under a glass dome. <br>  Not less famous <strong><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps%3Ft%3Dh%26key%3DABQIAAAAMtXhMjCwEozE5aV6DB6nfxRDj-kFzAoASnnb3lNRXX6ECc8T0xT_YCkeGydzDN_ID3iAC2c-XmYSqQ%26ie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D45.437833,-122.665127%26spn%3D0.001293,0.001955%26z%3D19%26om%3D1">Linus Torvalds</a></strong> , the house ( <em>45.437833, -122.665127</em> ) which is much more modest.  Much less is known about the home of the creator of an open and free OS than about the mega house of the richest person.  However, it is precisely known that it is much simpler and cozier organized, besides this building is the workplace of the main ‚Äúpenguin‚Äù of the planet.  It is located in the state of Oregon, Portland. <br>  The scandalous <strong><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps%3Ft%3Dh%26key%3DABQIAAAAMtXhMjCwEozE5aV6DB6nfxRDj-kFzAoASnnb3lNRXX6ECc8T0xT_YCkeGydzDN_ID3iAC2c-XmYSqQ%26ie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D34.097446,-118.427089%26spn%3D0.001526,0.001955%26z%3D19%26om%3D1">sir Elton John</a></strong> has possession ( <em>34.097446, -118.427089</em> ) in the very famous Woodside province.  Little is known about this estate, because  The singer mainly resides in his London possession or in a villa in Nice.  But I was interested in this building by the fact that lately there are rumors that it is in Woodside that Sir Elton is going to place a huge picture gallery that will overshadow even the great Louvre! <br>  The far and secluded place on the territory of the former military base is the <strong><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps%3Ft%3Dh%26key%3DABQIAAAAMtXhMjCwEozE5aV6DB6nfxRDj-kFzAoASnnb3lNRXX6ECc8T0xT_YCkeGydzDN_ID3iAC2c-XmYSqQ%26ie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D38.062318,-122.647655%26spn%3D0.002902,0.003911%26z%3D18%26om%3D1">home of George Lucas</a></strong> ( <em>38.062318, -122.647655</em> ). A very interesting ranch.  Besides the fact that the Lukas family lives there, there is also a whole film studio there!  It was there that the masters of cinematography made their films, among them Uncle Steve - Steven Spielberg.  Equipped with high-tech home in almost everything: after all, to create their famous "Star Wars" needed the most powerful computer equipment. <br>  The US National Monument, the house of the great musician and a very beautiful place - this is all the <strong><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps%3Ft%3Dh%26key%3DABQIAAAAMtXhMjCwEozE5aV6DB6nfxRDj-kFzAoASnnb3lNRXX6ECc8T0xT_YCkeGydzDN_ID3iAC2c-XmYSqQ%26ie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D35.045808,-90.022616%26spn%3D0.003017,0.003911%26z%3D18%26om%3D1">second home of Elvis Presley</a></strong> ( <em>35.045808, -90.022616</em> ). In the house there is a very interesting jungle style living room.  There is so much fur in the house that even the singer's bed is a huge piece of fur! <br>  The great John Lennon took US citizenship and housing for a very long time.  In July, the 73rd, Robert Ryan handed <strong>over his <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps%3Ft%3Dh%26key%3DABQIAAAAMtXhMjCwEozE5aV6DB6nfxRDj-kFzAoASnnb3lNRXX6ECc8T0xT_YCkeGydzDN_ID3iAC2c-XmYSqQ%26ie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D40.776713,-73.975727%26spn%3D0.001395,0.001955%26z%3D19%26om%3D1">apartment number 72</a> to the</strong> <em>Lennons</em> <strong>in the Dakota Building</strong> ( <em>40.776713, -73.975727</em> ).  It was a huge house of Stalinist type, lined with polished granite.  It was built in 1884 by the owner of the sewing company Singer, the millionaire Edward Clark.  The building stands at the Central Park, i.e.  almost in the middle of Manhattan, but in the year of construction this place was considered somewhere near the devil on the horns, because the house was called Dakota - after the distant state in the wild American West.  In this house, John Lennon was to live the last seven years of his life. <br>  Perhaps the scenery of "Pirates of the Caribbean" inspired the leading man to buy an island in the Caribbean.  <strong>Johnny Depp's personal island of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps%3Ft%3Dh%26key%3DABQIAAAAMtXhMjCwEozE5aV6DB6nfxRDj-kFzAoASnnb3lNRXX6ECc8T0xT_YCkeGydzDN_ID3iAC2c-XmYSqQ%26ie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D24.357496,-76.582818%26spn%3D0.026859,0.031285%26z%3D15%26om%3D1">Little Halls Pond Cay</a></strong> ( <em>24.357496, -76.582818</em> ), 1.6 km long, is located about 100 kilometers from the capital of the Bahamas, Nassau.  The actor paid for him $ 3.3 million.  The island has six sandy beaches, a villa in a bay surrounded by palm trees and a marina. <br>  <strong><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps%3Ft%3Dh%26key%3DABQIAAAAMtXhMjCwEozE5aV6DB6nfxRDj-kFzAoASnnb3lNRXX6ECc8T0xT_YCkeGydzDN_ID3iAC2c-XmYSqQ%26ie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D-17.44794,-179.159546%26spn%3D0.056253,0.062571%26z%3D14%26om%3D1">Mago Island</a></strong> ( <em>-17.44794, -179.159546</em> ) from the Fiji archipelago was purchased by Mel Gibson for $ 15 million.  A small island with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 5. 41 thousand acres caused quite a few headaches to the actor.  The fact is that the local people - the aborigines - strongly protested against this.  It is not known how Gibson managed to avoid a trial, but in late February, the actor sold his ranch in Montana.  The ranch, which area was 45 thousand acres, was transferred to a neighbor of Gibson, whose ownership was only 2 thousand acres. <br><br>  <strong>Obvious, unbelievable</strong> <br><br>  There are a lot of miracles in the world, created not only by human hands, but also by nature itself.

This is perhaps the most famous place in Italy.  The great arena of gladiator fights throughout the Roman Empire turned into a haven of ... cats.

One interesting fact from the creation of the sculpture: the lack of money led to the fact that in France, charitable donations, along with various entertainment events and a lottery, allowed to collect 2,250,000 francs.  In the United States, theatrical performances, art exhibitions, auctions and boxing fights were held to raise funds. <br>  Religious monuments are real masterpieces!

The history of the creation of the cathedral is very interesting: in addition to being built by several architects, its construction was so costly that the church continued to sell indulgences, etc., which led to the emergence of Lutheranism and the disintegration of Europe!  St. Peter's Square was built over 12 years, and is a real miracle in urban planning practice. <br>  <strong><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps%3Fll%3D39.916667,116.393333%26spn%3D0.01152,0.01502%26z%3D16%26t%3Dh%26key%3DABQIAAAAMtXhMjCwEozE5aV6DB6nfxRDj-kFzAoASnnb3lNRXX6ECc8T0xT_YCkeGydzDN_ID3iAC2c-XmYSqQ%26oi%3Dmap_misc%26ct%3Dapi_logo">The Forbidden City in Beijing</a></strong> ( <em>39.916667, 116.393333</em> ) is the largest palace complex in the world.

From here, 24 emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled. <br><br>  <strong>James Bond note</strong> <br><br>  Spy intrigue - one of the most interesting events in history.  Spying is capable of a great deal.  Now it is rarely used.  But let's look at those objects that are considered the most important among spies. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3DWashington%2BD.C.%26hl%3Den%26t%3Dk%26ie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D38.870529,-77.055627%26spn%3D0.005739,0.007821%26z%3D17%26iwloc%3Daddr%26om%3D1">The Pentagon</a></strong> ( <em>38.870529, -77.055627</em> ) is probably the most legendary military facility.  This applies not only to politics, but also to the IT world, because  there, as they say, the most powerful computers and their progress is associated with this building.

An interesting fact is that most of Google‚Äôs computers run on AMD processors, and the company collects the most computers that don‚Äôt go on sale! <br><br>  Well, perhaps that's all!  Search, dare: Google Maps has not yet revealed all its secrets.  This service still has a lot of different ‚ÄúEaster eggs‚Äù! <br><br>  <strong>For those who are in the tank</strong> <br><br>  To see these objects, you need to enter the coordinates in brackets next to each object in the search <a href="http://maps.google.com/">box</a> on <a href="http://maps.google.com/">maps.google.com</a> .  Just remember to switch to the display mode of the surface, not the main roads (for example, <em>Satellite</em> ). <br>  Sometimes after the coordinates in brackets, separated by a semicolon, the number z is indicated - this is the scale in the address of the object (it is not necessary to enter it in the search field !!!).  The maximum on the scale is 18. But many objects are not considered at this scale.  Therefore, find the line <strong>&amp; z = x &amp;</strong> in the link and replace the value of <em>x</em> with the one indicated in brackets.  Where the scale is not specified - it means that you can view the object and scale on the map. <br><br>  The article was published in the July issue of the magazine <a href="http://hi-tech.ua/">Hi-Tech PRO</a> .
