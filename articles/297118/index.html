  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What will happen to online advertising in Russia and in the world in three years?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.zenithoptimedia.com/">ZenithOptimedia</a> has conducted a study of the global and Russian online advertising market.  By 2018, the global mobile advertising market will reach $ 114 billion.  In 2015, its volume reached $ 50 billion.  Mobile will overtake all media broadcasts, except television, whose volume in 2018 will be $ 215 billion, compared with $ 206 billion in 2015, AdIndex <a href="http://www.adindex.ru/news/tendencies/2015/12/8/130566.phtml">writes,</a> citing a study. <br><br>  According <a href="http://www.zenithoptimedia.com/global-mobile-advertising-expenditure-overtake-desktop-2018/">to the</a> ZenithOptimedia <a href="http://www.zenithoptimedia.com/global-mobile-advertising-expenditure-overtake-desktop-2018/">report</a> , the mobile segment will grow by an average of 32% annually from 2015 to 2018. The desktop will reach its peak of $ 114 billion in 2017, after decreasing to $ 113 billion in 2018. <br><br><h4>  Programmatic advertising will occupy 60% of all display advertising in 2016 </h4><br>  The programmatic share in desktop advertising will be 53% for the first time this year and will reach 60% by 2016. <a name="habracut"></a>  Over the past few years, the segment has increased from $ 5 billion (2012) to $ 38 billion (2015).  Growth averaged 100% per year.  Now, due to the capacity of the market, experts predict a segment growth of 34% in 2016 and 26% in 2017.  After that, two-thirds of the global display advertising will be purchased using programmatic technologies.

      According to ZenithOptimedia estimates, the segment size in the US market is $ 16.8 billion in 2015, which is equal to 44% of the global expenditure on programmatic advertising purchases.  The UK is second only to this indicator, with $ 2.6 billion and 7%, respectively. <br><br><h4>  The Internet will become more popular than television in 2018 </h4><br>  TV accounts for 38% of global advertising budgets in 2015.  However, experts expect that TV will gradually give way to the Internet.  The peak of television fell in 2012, when its share reached 39.7%, in 2018 this figure will be 34.8%. <br><br>  Without contextual advertising and paid search, the cost of TV placement will be 44.7% of the cost of display advertising in 2015, and 42.9% in 2018. <br><br>  According to the forecast, audiovisual advertising will reach a record high of 48.4% of the volume of display advertising in 2015, and by 2018 its share will be 48.9%. <br><br><h4>  Crucial moment </h4><br>  According to ZenithOptimedia, the global advertising market has remained stable since 2011.  However, 2016 will be a special year.  In 2016, the American presidential election, the Summer Olympics and the UEFA Champions League will be held.  Experts predict an increase in the advertising market by 4.7% compared to 3.9% in 2015. <br><br>  According to ZenithOptimedia, elections in the United States will provide a net increase in advertising spending in the US market of $ 3.2 billion.  The Olympic Games will increase global advertising budgets by $ 2 billion (TV and outdoor advertising).  UEFA will lead to an increase in advertising spending of $ 0.9 billion, which will be concentrated on TV and outdoor advertising mainly in Europe, as well as in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. <br><br>  Between 2005 and 2010, advertising spending grew annually by about 10.7% in Brazil, 10.3% in Russia, and 16.9% in China.  Brazil and Russia are now in recession, the Chinese market is slowing down, and between 2015 and 2018, market growth from year to year will be 3.5% in Brazil, 5.3% in Russia and 7.5% in China. <br><br>  However, at the international level, Russia and China will continue to set records in terms of growth in advertising costs, researchers predict. <br><br><h4>  Russia </h4><br>  The Russian online advertising market is estimated by JP Morgan at $ 2.7 billion and by the end of 2015 should grow by only $ 100 million, to $ 2.8 billion. <br><br>  The main driver of growth of the online advertising market in the coming years will be advertising on mobile devices, analysts of Sberbank CIB write in their report, Russian Media and Internet.  From 2015 to 2018, this market, according to their forecasts, will grow by an average of 33% per year.  For comparison: in general, the entire online advertising market will grow annually by 14%, the Vedomosti newspaper reports. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297118/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297118/</a></p>
