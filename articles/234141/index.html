Today I will tell you how the lab lab looks like from the inside.  At the beginning there is a little information about the exam, rare certificates that I managed to find from the employees of our company, and then we will move on to exciting stories from my practice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b9/b68/825/3b9b688251b5438cb2e5ef3be90c9242.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Initially, the exam consisted of a 2-day laboratory work.  Since 1993, certification has changed many times, following new directions in the IT industry, adding new technologies and vice versa, excluding those technologies that have become irrelevant. <br><br>  <b>Currently the following CCIE certifications are available:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ CCIE Routing &amp; Switching - the most demanded and most frequently encountered certification. <br>  ‚Ä¢ CCIE Security <br>  ‚Ä¢ CCIE Collaboration (formerly CCIE Voice) <br>  ‚Ä¢ CCIE Data Center <br>  ‚Ä¢ CCIE Service Provider <br>  ‚Ä¢ CCIE Service Provider Operations <br>  ‚Ä¢ CCIE Wireless <br><br>  After passing the exam - you are assigned the status of <s>guru</s> expert in the field of network technologies. <habracut><br><br>  But earlier certificates looked completely different and certified specialists were much less.  Certificates and honorary boards are undoubtedly the pride of every technician in the field of networking technologies!  Many employees decorate their desks or cabinets with them.  Engineers in our office are no exception.  I photographed copies of awards that were given earlier and now. <br><br>  So, rarity number 1 is a medal (we hid the names in the photos, our employees are <s>embarrassed for</s> their unusual modesty): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d93/cbb/bc9/d93cbbbc9187424d8e888c1a5e34f00d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Later copies and honorary boards for 10 years of maintaining certification have also come across, some employees have entire collections: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/145/924/d34/145924d3440648f08c7e4a2d2d8000a7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Or such: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f8/b4c/80f/7f8b4c80f0be48f1acfb7f65824f6517.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Over time, the rewards change, but the status of a CCIE expert is always the same and highly valued by employers around the world.  To maintain the CCIE certificate, you must retake the written exam once every 2 years.  And not necessarily it should be on the same technology.  After 10 years of maintaining the status they send you an honorary board :) <br><br>  <b>The emergence of the possibility of delivery of laboratory work in Moscow.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  As you probably know, CCIE certification consists of a written exam (written) and laboratory work.  Until 2008, it was possible to pass a laboratory exam only in stationary laboratories, of which there are not so many in the world.  The closest to us is in Brussels.  But then the scheme of mobile laboratories was invented, when candidates who want to pass a laboratory exam can try to pass an exam at a local Cisco office.  The equipment is remotely connected to the office with the laboratory, in our case also to Brussels. <br><br>  The first time the mobile laboratory came to us already in September 2008.  Wow, how much time has passed!  At first we ran only one track - Routing &amp; Switching.  Now the track on Security is already available and even somehow managed to conduct CCIE Voice =)) As I persuaded the central team and searched for phones for labs - a separate story. <br><br>  Since we do not have a local lab, we also don‚Äôt have a local proctor.  We were all the time "written out" proctors from abroad. <br><br>  A proctor is an examiner in a laboratory exam, such a network professor.  He sets up equipment before the exam, monitors candidates for expert status during the exam, answers questions and fixes technical problems if they suddenly arise.  Proctors usually also have CCIE certificates, and some even a few. <br><br>  Our first proctor came from Australia.  Later he came to us several times, our engineer who was engaged in preparing for the lab called him ‚Äúthe Cartoon‚Äù for his similarity with the cartoon characters and constant jokes, and he really liked in Russia.  At first, it was difficult to talk to him, because he constantly chewed on the last syllables and strove to insert his Australian slang.  Also in Russia, he first saw the snow and felt a real cold!  Now he also works at Cisco, but he is no longer a proctor.)) <br><br>  Then proctors came to us from other countries, or rather the lab came from labs in Brussels, Tokyo, Dubai and so on.  In general, everyone was happy, we always prepared well and helped with equipment and logistics.  They were all different.  Proctor from Tokyo was a Chinese, who was born in Taiwan.  He was terribly afraid of everything and was somehow lost, he was looking for a taxi for an hour, it was one more epic.  Proctor from Brussels was a young guy who constantly smoked and was happy about our cheap cigarettes.  He came with his bride.  The bride was half Brazilian, half Belgian, absolutely charming!  Now they are already married.  And he is engaged in the development of the lab and also does not work as a proctor. <br><br>  Also came to us very interesting characters.  Usually candidates come to Moscow for delivery from Russia and the CIS (Ukraine, Belarus, etc.).  Foreigners came to us several times.  One Egyptian citizen was late for several hours, did not even try to hand over to the lab, and then demanded that we settle him in the center of Moscow for $ 50.  Somehow a foreign citizen could not write on the keyboard with Russian letters.  He said that the Russian letters terribly <s>frighten him</s> distract.  Some candidates are very nervous.  These usually do not pass.  Therefore, we must prepare better and be less nervous.  And do not be late, yes.  Because nobody will compensate for the missed time.  All strictly and by the hour. <br><br>  A lot of questions come that you can take with you.  You can not take anything with you.  Maximum - glasses and a sweater (jacket).  No electronic devices or stationery can not be brought.  Everything is strictly prohibited.  Of course, we do not check with dogs and do not force them to pass through the metal detector, but if the proctor suddenly sees that you brought something with you, your exam will be immediately canceled.  Is it worth the risk? <br><br>  In Russia, fortunately, we had no such precedents.  I know that often happens in China.  It‚Äôs generally difficult with China, they manage to memorize the variants of laboratory work, and then they are cloned and the variants walk around the network.  And this is also one of the reasons why exam versions are constantly changing. <br><br>  Of course, few people donate from the first time, but in Russia one of the best percentages for passing the CCIE. <br><br>  I was told that there was one person who had passed 17 times. And in the end, he did.  But the maximum number of attempts I saw was over 30!  But this, of course, is rare.  Usually pass from the second to the third time.  Employees also often rent out in Moscow, too, not all the first time, so no cronyism! <br><br>  First, the exam checks the script, then the proctor necessarily looks, re-checks it manually.  And surely another proctor in another time zone.  Therefore, by the morning your exam can be checked!  If the candidate thinks that he still scored a much better score and passed the lab, then you can appeal.  Perhaps it makes sense if you are very confident about yourself and your score is very close to passing.  But appeals do not always satisfy.  The candidate reads assignments very privately and does them incorrectly.  There are a lot of pitfalls in all Cisco exams, and all tasks must be carefully and carefully checked. <br><br>  Photo from the laboratory exam!  Maybe someone will recognize themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fa/9a1/f39/6fa9a1f39d0e4784b7bd9663b7350b69.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Also some background information about our labs.</b> <br><br>  The following laboratory exams will be held in Moscow, as usual in our office in Krylatskoye. <br><br>  Dates: December 1 - 05, 2014 and from March 16 to 20, 2015! <br><br>  Also, from September 1 to September 5, a laboratory exam will be held in Kazan, in Innopolis. <br><br>  By the way, this will be the first mobile laboratory exam that does not take place at a Cisco office. <br><br>  Follow the announcements! <br><br>  While tracks are available Routing &amp; Switching and Security. <br><br>  You can always follow the schedule of our mobile laboratories on the website: <br><br>  <a href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/docs/DOC-3224">learningnetwork.cisco.com/docs/DOC-3224</a> <br><br>  And you can always write me and ask questions. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234141/</a></p>
