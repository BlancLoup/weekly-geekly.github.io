We already have megaprojects, startups, ventures and mentors.  In general, we want not only our programmers to go to Moscow, St. Petersburg, but also listeners from other regions come to us.  Last year we gathered 300 people, in this we want twice as much.  It seems we have a chance, because we are well prepared. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Conference <a href="http://www.dump-it.ru/">DUMP</a> (Development. Usability. Management. Practice) will be held <b>May 25-27 in Yekaterinburg</b> at the Hotel Angelo.  First of all, we focused on developers and PM, engaged in web projects, mobile applications, highload-services.  This means no internet marketing, advertising reports, well, about startups - maybe only a little bit. <br><br><h4>  10 reasons to think about going on a DUMP: </h4><br><br>  <b>1.</b> Invaluable experience of developers, or what they don‚Äôt tell in your smoking room: How to deploy and promote applications in the Apple Store, cheap usability testing, Java garbage collection secrets, Web design automation in jQuery code and many much more.

      <b>2.</b> The best speakers of CodeFest, Highload and RIT (Mikhail Davydov, Andrey Sitnik, Alexey Ragozin), as well as stories about the ‚Äúinner kitchen‚Äù of projects from Yandex, AlterGEO, JetBrains, Bitrix, Naumen, SKB Kontur, DublGisa and a number of not so famous companies.  Only technical details.  Well, look already at the list of reports - <a href="http://www.dump-it.ru/programma/">tynts</a> . <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Techno-geek show in the lobby in non-stop mode - show robots, old school computer games, pokatushki on segway, musical numbers - and even a masseur.  Everything, than the IT pros heart will calm down in one bottle. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Super workshops - Designing interfaces for mobile applications, intangible tools for motivating developers, workshops on node.js, as well as on Ruby, Erlang, building deb-packages, and one more thing. <br><br>  <b>5. The</b> correct theory - knowledge for growth.  Section ‚ÄúGoblin Reserve‚Äù - Kotlin - a new convenient JVM / JS programming language, Startup in 1.5 hours - Scala, Play 2.0 Framework, Heroku, Erlang subtleties, etc. <br><br>  <b>6.</b> Star speakers - Alexander Orlov, Slava Pankratov, Sergey Ryzhikov, Andrey Sitnik, Vladimir Zhuravlev, Andrey Rogozin. <br><br>  <b>7.</b> The fact that it is not necessary to know, but it is interesting to listen - How a developer can grow an entrepreneur in himself, How to get or sell a share in a business and some more sketches.  These are not technical nuances, this is an expansion of the horizon. <br><br>  <b>8.</b> World premiere.  Two weeks before the official presentation, Nikita Shamgunov (co-founder of MemSQL <a href="http://www.memsql.com/">www.memsql.com</a> , Silicon Valley), will present his new generation of DBMS, which was originally sharpened to work with RAM, and not with the disk.  Nikita has already received investments from Y Combinator and Ashton Kutcher, but will present his database at home before the world community. <br><br>  <b>9.</b> Cookies!  In a sense, lunch is included in the price :) And the organizers are taken to make afterparty. <br><br>  <b>10.</b> The only conference with hiking.  On May 27, DUMP participants will be able to spend a wonderful day in the Ural forest in the company of their own kind;) climb up the rocks, swim in the lake, play geocaching, eat a soup for lunch. <br><br>  I would like to present several streams separately: <br><br><h4>  To interface scientists </h4><br>  The flow of interface design will be more attention to mobile applications.  This is despite the fact that a separate stream is devoted to mobile development.  A special report about the new products presented at the Conference on Computer-Human Interaction in Austin (Texas) in early May, Philip Smirnov (Motko Design - creators of the News 360 interface) will tell about the design of mobile interfaces, and Valery Schuchkin from DoubleGIS will tell about the fight with Guideline Nazi Mobile OS  Everyone is talking about the creation of interfaces, and we also added a report on their modernization, since rebuilding is often more difficult than doing it from scratch. <br><br><h4>  Project managers </h4><br>  It seems that there is already difficult to say something new.  But we tried to collect in one section reports about the hottest problems of PM-specialists: managing a distributed team, time tracking, motivation and negotiations based on feedback.  Naturally about the practical experience of the application of Scrum and Kanban a series of reports.  They will tell - Alexander Orlov, Slava Pankratov, Sergey Ryzhikov.  On the second day, a whole PM class is scheduled for 8 hours already. <br><br><h4>  Only hardcore </h4><br>  Programming outside the web.  The section under the motto How things work is the design of network data transfer protocols, as Yandex builds 2 billion snippets a day, garbage collection secrets in Java, extensions for PHP. <br><br><h4>  Goblin Reserve </h4><br>  This is a special section about young, but promising programming languages.  Let's talk about Kotlin, Erlang, Scala.  It is too early to collect separate conferences about them, but there is already interest and we have found specialists who are ready to share their experience. <br><br>  In addition, separate sections will be devoted to front-end development, administration, web programming, databases, mobile technologies.  In general, this whole attraction of unprecedented generosity in the <a href="http://www.dump-it.ru/programma/">program</a> . <br><br>  By the way, the <b>tour on May 27</b> is not an entertaining appendage to the conference, but the quintessence of backstage communication is the most important thing in the event for some visitors.  Here to you for drawing attention to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.289402377751234.77747.187464147945058%26type%3D1">photo album</a> from the autumn hike and the <a href="">panorama</a> from it. <br><br>  If anything - register <a href="http://www.dump-it.ru/register/">here</a> . <br><br>  The organizer of the conference, the company IT-People.ru, accepts useful tips, comments and suggestions in the comments or on the <a href="http://www.dump-it.ru/mailto/">page</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143868/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143868/</a></p>
