  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Business on trackers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>  The BitTorrent tracker is the actual web page where everyone can post information about the file, be it a movie, a game, etc.  A specialized torrent file is also created, which contains information about the owner's IP address, file size, hash size, etc. <br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe tracker is that everyone wants to download not the file itself, but the torrent file, which contains the IP addresses of those users who have already downloaded the file and become automatic donors to a particular file (for example, a game or movie).  Thus, the more file donors, the faster we will be able to download it, automatically becoming another unit of file distribution. <br><br>  In other words, the web page does not contain any materials, and therefore does not violate any copyright, and therefore the site is fully working on legal rights.  More detailed information you can read on Wikipedia. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Create your Tracker</b> <br><br>  To date, the Internet has a lot of "engines" for torrent trackers, most of which work for free.  Any experienced person can go from free to his ‚Äúengine‚Äù to create his own unique website, increasing its popularity.  For example, I used free projects for this for about two years. <br><br>  Now I use the TBDev tracker, which is too simple, but with careful configuration it can work with 40,000 users per day, although with a heavy load the server refuses to work and shuts down. <br><br>  <b>Cash prospects</b> <br><br>  <b>Option One</b> <br><br>  For example, take the most used Russian torrent tracker <a href="http://rutracker.org/">http://rutracker.org</a> . <br>  We place on it our banners or a number of links, as is customary in online advertising, since this portal is known throughout the global network. <br><br>  <b>Virtues</b> <br><br>  With the increasing popularity of your resource, you can achieve a monthly income of up to twenty thousand rubles. <br><br>  <b>disadvantages</b> <br><br>  License owners of information from time to time require the closure of distributions, and we are forced to obey the law.  Since we do not have a legal ‚Äúroof‚Äù, we should be maximum sensitive to such prohibitions so that our site is not closed for a year until all the circumstances are clarified. <br><br>  <b>Option two</b> <br><br>  For example, some groups of providers with specific IP addresses have access to your local torrent tracker.  Using them, we place the links of your tracker on their pages. <br>  Using my links, the provider pays for my hosting of the German server and pays me up to one hundred thousand rubles in cash every month. <br><br>  Why do they have to pay me?  Due to the fact that all subscribers download one from the other, the provider does not have to pay money to the more main provider, since all the information being transferred is considered to be local.  And if you consider that each file weighs from 1 to 6 GB, then the income is per person, because all customers pay, and the provider does not pay anyone, except for a small part of me for promoting their website. <br><br>  The advantage is that the distribution only for a narrow circle of people.  Information owners are left with a nose, and everyone is happy - the latest innovations can be downloaded in an instant. <br>  The disadvantages are that there are few subscribers, advertising cannot be placed, and if the provider gets tired of me, the hosting fee will eat me, and I will remain as an old woman with a broken trough.  Then you have to provide your service to other providers, which is very difficult. <br><br>  <b>Summarize</b> <br><br>  Although this task requires technical implementations, there will always be people who can finance your project financially and with people.  And if you constantly improve the performance of your project, then you will not be left without a reward. <br>  I will end with an example, similar to my tracker, torrent "Shareman".  It is also closed, like mine, only much larger.  We are a kind of competitors with one provider who pays him monthly up to 1 million rubles.  Only there is a considerable team of programmers, but this does not prevent them from having more profit than me. <br><br>  Now it's up to you.  Dare! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101057/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101057/</a></p>
