  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Amazing stories</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I look at myself 7-8 years ago and am surprised. <br>  Well, how was it possible to get 400 bucks for a simple database on Access? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At that time I was studying at the university, a friend called to suggest that the furniture company be based on Access.  I came to them, talked, I realized that they are not particularly whipped in computers, but even more so in programming. <br>  What was even more surprising was that the company's employees themselves ordered this system from me.  They simply simply said to the boss. We need a base with calculations, reports, and he gave the go-ahead. <br><br>  I saw the company's head itself when the development was already in full swing.  He came, met, gave me an advance payment for the work that he did not see, but according to the workers, the system is under development and everything is cool.  In the first, I saw a man who in cash wears a really wad of money.  From his side it was stupid in front of me to get this pack and count me the money.  After the first base, he ordered a few more and I did not hesitate to ask for an impressive amount for the order.  No questions, I came to get a pack of counted me the amount. <br><br>  Well, since everyone who is in computers is automatically attributed to specialists in networks and computers assembling, I had such work for this company.  Go to buy a PCI extender and put it into the computer, well, how many 20 bucks, but you can‚Äôt do it in 60.

      For myself, I called such customers gold. <br>  I am all to the fact that such customers are full and in any country.  Now I am actively working with England and there sometimes show a site a business card made by local.  Made just at the level of CTML, no design when called the price is just a shame to watch. <br><br>  On the one hand, of course, such clients can sell anything for any real amount.  But on the other hand, the quality of such products is very far from even acceptable. <br><br>  Did you have such clients?  What kind of business?  What did you get? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90974/</a></p>
