  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Highscreen Alpha R review: Full HD, two batteries and other animals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Full HD screens in smartphones are not so rare, so the B-brands began to release their models, equipped with a Full HD screen.  And the first in the Russian market budget smartphone announced the brand Highscreen.  And, of course, I did not miss the opportunity to get acquainted with the new product.  It is called, by the way, Highscreen Alpha R. <br><br>  I will begin, perhaps, with a meeting on clothes, because you can‚Äôt immediately look at the screen without looking at the smartphone and its surroundings :) <br>  I, by the way, love to watch the evolution of the gadgets of a single brand.  Bearing in mind that ‚Äúthe devil is in the details,‚Äù manufacturers pay a lot of attention to trivia.  For example, before the Highscreen smartphone boxes were so deliberately ‚Äúcardboard‚Äù, interspersed with different shades of brown and beige.  Alpha R received an emasculated monochromatic light box with a proprietary "anatomical" analysis on the facade. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de5/e13/e55/de5e13e557b26610dfa62682eb44f464.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The smartphone corresponds to it completely: it looks ... um ... completed both outside and inside.

Black remained the front panel, and the edges and back - white.  Against this background, fingerprints are almost invisible, and the Alpha R looks decent even after active use.  ‚ÄúWow, wow!‚Äù The inner girl-girl screamed and opened the back cover to insert the SIM card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/706/d9a/faf/706d9afaf3b3ac961d32f655c3634fbb.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/94a/5fd/3db/94a5fd3db27bb92268a91cf289d91b9a.jpg"><br>  The slots were partially hidden under the battery, but you still do not need to remove it to install SIM cards.  As usual, one slot is only for the GSM band, the second one is also for 3G. <br>  A microSD memory card slot is located nearby, but it is not included, and I didn‚Äôt get from my smartphone.  Why, if this is 4 GB of own memory?  For me, so little, and someone, maybe enough.  Time has shown that I was mistaken.  Highscreen Alpha R does not record photos from the camera and screenshots in the internal storage, but requires a card.  Nothing can be selected in the settings: according to the manufacturer, this was done specifically so that you can install more applications in the internal memory. <br>  You still want to put the map in order to record all kinds of movies and TV shows there, this is understandable.  But it is strange that you can not check one of the important functions - shooting - right in the store. <br><br>  The smartphone has successfully located buttons and connectors: power, recharging and headphones on the top, volume - on the left. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ac/12c/8c2/0ac12c8c2dee477b5d705b277bb08286.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e6/37e/664/2e637e664b6d7c9d81bdc2eaacf0800c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c0/d2b/b8f/5c0d2bb8f38c808bcb4ebe3f22670a43.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce1/b27/04d/ce1b2704d318418d58df46c9d0ae76c8.jpg"><br>  Sensory elements made under the display.  And he, by the way, deserves all praise, and not only because he has a fashionable high resolution. <br><br><h4>  Display and performance </h4><br>  So, what is the display deserves praise?  Firstly, the IPS-matrix produces saturated and at the same time realistic colors.  Secondly, the display has large viewing angles, for which another technology is indirectly responsible - OGS (One Glass Solution).  As is clear from the decoding, there is no air gap between the glass and the sensor elements, as in other smartphones, due to this the display becomes thinner.  As for the viewing angles, I will not answer in detail: in the couple of days that Alpha R was my guest, it was not possible to compare with the usual IPS-matrix.  But subjectively, everything is fine with them :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f6/9ae/526/7f69ae526ecf57f87d97bd2f0f033de9.jpg"><br>  And thirdly - the resolution.  I can safely say that now you don‚Äôt need to convert videos to ‚Äúspecial for smartphones‚Äù - 480x274 or something like that.  You can easily watch anything in the resolution of Full HD.  Another thing is that the movie ‚Äúweighing‚Äù 20 gigabytes does not pull the smartphone, slows down, but not all computers will cope with it.  And why force it: on 5 inches of many nuances of the quality of ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù, converted 2-3 GB videos with the original resolution of 1920x1080, I did not even notice with a magnifying glass!  And the smartphone shows such files without any problems. <br>  And this is not surprising: there is a decent 4-core processor at 1.5 GHz and a gigabyte of RAM.  Isn't it enough?  In words it can be, in fact, enough: for multitasking, and for downloading demanding games.  Tests also rate performance fairly high: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed2/5b4/419/ed25b4419169460a480b6da08679b302.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b6/964/f70/9b6964f70715c034827e4d53c41af65a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b98/1a5/bf3/b981a5bf3fcffbc7b338fb21036c0872.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Power Features </h4><br>  Alpha R differs from most devices not only in high resolution of the screen, but also in an unusual bundle. <br>  With all the power of modern smartphones, they have a drawback - gluttony.  There are, of course, models with advanced batteries, like the same Highscreen Boost, which already got 4,160 mAh with standard 2-2.5 thousand.  But he is rather thick and I personally, like a girl, like less than a two-color Alpha R. <br>  And for the "alpha" came up with another tricky move, not new, but extremely rarely used: the second battery in the kit.  And not the same ‚Äútwo thousandth‚Äù as the first, but by 4,000 mAh, which approximately doubles the operation time.  That is, instead of a day or two (depending on how many hours you spend on the smartphone), it will last 3-4, or even more.  A more capacious back panel is attached to the capacious battery, and the smartphone is almost 50 grams heavier and a couple of millimeters thicker.  But it does not lose its charm, but to keep it even more convenient.  Yes, and no one forces to put the batteries in turn: you throw the spare into the bag, you need it - you take it out and use it.  It seems a trifle, but how it helps! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6bc/2a3/bab/6bc2a3babf02b93ae6f0987eed6863b1.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/908/d6c/85b/908d6c85b1ceffdc06a9ed8aadee081e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Camera and communication </h4><br>  Finally - about a few important things. <br>  The main camera received a resolution of 8 megapixels, autofocus and flash.  Why not 13?  Because the number of megapixels is pure marketing, which has little to do with the quality of photos.  And it is very good for a smartphone that is not positioned as a camera phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf8/428/97c/bf842897c9b2cfc6d178f15dc14cacf8.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/202/62a/4f3/20262a4f34bfee5f8c41c8b32eb84a68.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/168/db9/5df/168db95df9d7435cb82de876f0a159a2.jpg"><br>  Alpha R shoots and quite decent videos, which are nice to see on the display before posting on YouTube and Instagram (yes, if you don‚Äôt know it yet, square video was added to the square photos!). <br><br>  Recently, it‚Äôs not accepted to write about the telephone part, but I‚Äôll still mention: the interlocutor‚Äôs voice is heard well, the proximity sensor works as it should (you can‚Äôt press the microphone to switch off the microphone), the radio module is quite powerful and doesn‚Äôt lose the network from scratch. <br><br>  Pros: excellent display Full HD, second battery included, affordable price, high performance. <br>  Cons: for photos and videos you need a memory card, not the best camera, not enough RAM, cheap-mediocre complete headphones. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4>  Two body colors, sleek design and excellent display - the Alpha R has everything a woman needs from a smartphone.  But at the same time, he, I'm sorry, not only "girl"!  My faithful became extremely interested in the fact that she came to me for the ‚Äúshovel‚Äù - despite the fact that he sincerely despises sensory devices.  And on the last day I put my SIM card there, talked a couple of times and even started watching football in a place where the TV is not provided :) <br>  It is surprising, of course, the need to immediately buy a memory card and the fact that the flagship was not given more RAM - well, and the price is much lower than its counterparts, less than 13 thousand at the start of sales.  Therefore, with the fact that Highscreen Alpha R is quite a modern fast smartphone with a stunning screen, it is difficult to argue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191004/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191004/</a></p>
