The main prize is a dinner with Terry White at a Moscow restaurant.  The authors of the questions, who took the second and third places, will receive as a gift a book by Terry White <a href="http://www.boffobooks.ru/book.html%3Fid%3D6378">‚ÄúWhat does the business want from IT‚Äù</a> with the author's autograph.  (Terry White and the contest organizers will determine the winners personally.) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Biography</strong> <br><br>  Terry began his career as a geologist in South Africa, but soon became interested in information technology.  He worked as the Director of Information Technology at a large machine-building enterprise.  During his work he: <br><br>  - reduced the number of critical errors from 22 per month to 1 in two months; <br>  - created a change management department whose task was to help the company's business units to extract the maximum benefit from the information systems they use; <br>  - introduced the practice of benchmarking in the work of IT-services, and his company constantly kept in 5% of the enterprises of the engineering industry, the most efficient use of information technology; <br>  - introduced in his department the concept of an autonomous working group, according to which the department‚Äôs employees themselves set themselves tasks and rigorously sought to fulfill the planned indicators; <br>  - introduced the principle of "universal assessment of results", according to which each of his employees evaluated not only his work, but also the work of his superiors and subordinates <br>  created the ‚ÄúDepartment of Architecture‚Äù even before the concept of ‚ÄúIT-architecture‚Äù gained universal recognition in the IT industry; <br>  - created a call center for IT, for which it was necessary to develop special software, since the very concept of the call center was so new that nothing of the kind existed on the information technology market; <br>  - created a laboratory for testing applications, in which its people tested new software and tested new concepts for the benefits that they could give to the company; <br>  - was Chairman of the Information Technology Management Division of the Computer Society of South Africa (CSSA).  While in this position, he introduced the tradition of monthly ‚Äúbreakfasts for IT directors,‚Äù which they gathered to discuss common problems and share innovative solutions. <br><br>  As chairman, he also founded the award ‚ÄúThe Best IT Manager of the Year‚Äù, as he was absolutely confident that the director of information technology at the company should play a more prominent role and that outstanding success in this area should not go unnoticed.  The award has been awarded for 14 years. <br><br>  His areas of interest include such areas as the development of IT strategies and business strategies, the organization of IT activities in an enterprise, the monitoring of IT effectiveness, the management of projects and changes in IT, and the budgeting of IT.  In addition, Terry is also involved in information technology management and logistics in the field of IT, in particular, in procurement of complex integrated IT systems for businesses, helping enterprises to acquire those systems that best meet their needs, at a price that they can afford.  He works with both private business and government organizations. <br><br>  He is the author of numerous articles for a wide range of newspapers and magazines and has two monthly columns in highly respected journals.  A recognized authority in the field of information technology, he advises industry journalists on the current state of the information technology industry. <br><br>  Terry is the author of three books on IT management: Reinventing the IT Department;  ‚ÄúWhat does business want from IT‚Äù (What Business Really wants from IT), which has already been translated into Russian;  and also ‚ÄúSpeed ‚Äã‚Äãup the Mess‚Äù - about the features of IT management in small business ‚Äù.  He also co-authored several books on project management and risk management, as well as future trends in IT management.  In the near future, he plans to write two more books - ‚ÄúWhat does IT want from business‚Äù (What IT needs from business) and ‚ÄúHow and what to buy - IT material and technical support‚Äù (How to buy stuff - procurement for IT).  He regularly speaks at conferences. <br><br>  Many of Terry‚Äôs ideas have been adopted by Butler Group, an IT research company.  He also participated in the development of Val IT, the IT corporate governance methodology (the next generation of COBIT), designed to maximize the benefits that IT services bring to their companies. <br><br>  The goal of his life is to ensure that IT departments cease to be an auxiliary element of the business and begin to bring real and tangible benefits to the business, helping companies improve their business performance, achieve the realization of the benefits that were planned for the implementation of IT systems, and directly participate in creating new products, developing new markets and new distribution channels. <br><br>  Terry travels a lot and mountaineering in his free time.  He conquered several peaks in the Alps, the Andes, as well as in various mountain ranges of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and China. <br><br>  <strong>About the book "What does business want from IT"</strong> <br><br>  The book "What does business want from IT?" Terry White offers a revolutionary new approach to the role of IT in the company.  The traditional ‚ÄúI work in IT‚Äù becomes unacceptable.  Instead, a new one is required - ‚ÄúI work in business.‚Äù  The purpose of the book is to change the way of thinking in that situation when IT-specialists are at a deadlock, focusing exclusively on IT-products.  The book reveals the secret - what can be done to help IT make a truly significant contribution to increasing the company's profits.  The book offers practical examples and schemes that will help to understand and implement this idea, transforming it into account the specific specifics of the business. <br><br>  The book is addressed primarily to senior and mid-level managers, for whom it is important to know: IT can exceed all their expectations, as well as IT specialists, who have long since come to take their place in the management of the company. <br><br>  The first Russian-language edition of this book appeared thanks to the efforts of the publishing house <a href="http://grevtsovpublisher.ru/">‚ÄúGrevtsov Publisher</a> . <a href="http://grevtsovpublisher.ru/">‚Äù</a>  You can purchase this book <a href="http://www.boffobooks.ru/book.html%3Fid%3D6378">in the Boffo book store!</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20883/</a></p>
