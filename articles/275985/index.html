      For students of IT specialties there is a program " <b>Microsoft Student Partners</b> ".  Microsoft Student Partners (MSP) is a worldwide educational program that selects creative, technically savvy IT-related students.  The program increases participants' chances for future employment by offering them to take courses in subjects not taught in universities, including training in Microsoft technologies. <br><br>  MSPs are those people who are concerned about the lack of relevance of modern education, who are constantly learning something new and striving to make the world a better place, telling other students about modern technology. <br><br>  Program participants get access to the latest Microsoft software, development tools, various activities in the field of information technology, as well as contacts and communication with like-minded people. <br><br>  Microsoft partner students do amazing things: <br><ul><li>  Participate in hackathons; </li><li>  Develop games and applications; </li><li>  Conduct technological measures; </li><li>  Startups are organized; </li><li>  Communicate with experts in the IT industry around the world. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  MSP Summit </h3><br>  Last weekend at the Moscow office of Microsoft, the All-Russian Summit of partner students was held, where the most active participants of the program gathered. <br><br>  We talked about how to make the world better with technology. <br>  Vladislav Kasyanenko (Ukraine) and Alexey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/asommer/" class="user_link">asommer</a> Sommer (Belarus) told how the MSP program works in their countries.  I, having recently returned from an international summit of student partners, shared the experience of my European colleagues. <br><br>  Within the framework of the summit several round tables were held, during which each participant was able to share his successful experience on one of the topics: <br><ul><li>  Work with educational institutions; </li><li>  Game development; </li><li>  Interaction with regional IT-communities; </li><li>  Involving schoolchildren in IT; </li><li>  Organization hakatonov. </li></ul><br><br>  But we not only worked!  For many, a trip to the summit was a great way to see the capital.  The team of organizers prepared an evening quest for us, which we were able to see some of the sights, visited GUM and Old Arbat.  You can find our adventures <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/rumsp/">on Instagram</a> .  It was cold, but very fun and interesting! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d14/fa4/fd3/d14fa4fd32454876b97d0945196bf25f.jpg"><br><br><h3>  MSP for me </h3><br>  Not to be unfounded, I want to share my story about how the MSP program has changed my life. <br>  This story began in 2012, when Yevgeny Romin, who was still not very famous, came to me for a couple.  He told us about Windows 7, Microsoft Office, and about something else ... I was very hooked then that at least someone in the university told us about really modern and interesting things! <br><br>  Later, in the summer, I contacted Evgeny and asked: ‚ÄúHow can I become an MSP?‚Äù, To which I received a very simple answer: ‚ÄúJust write me a letter and they will contact you‚Äù.  It was so. <br><br>  In the fall of 2012, I became a Microsoft partner student.  As part of the MSP team, I traveled around Perm universities, introduced students to Windows 8 and how easy it is to develop applications for a new (at that time) operating system.  All the same in the fall, but already as part of the All-Russian team of student partners, I visited Student Day 3.0 and even took a photo with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580,_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2">Steve Ballmer</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67e/0e4/d31/67e0e4d315654f8e80e922ce2a2f3310.jpg"><br><br>  A year later, my team (C4L), as well as the Eugene team ( <a href="http://brainy.pro/ru/">Brainy Studio</a> ), won the <a href="http://imaginecup.ru/">Imagine Cup</a> regional final.  In 2014, our teams were the best in the Russian finals in the Social Projects and Games categories, and Brainy Studio <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/232183/">won the World Finals in Seattle (USA)</a> . <br><br>  The status of a Microsoft partner student and the winner of the Russian Imagine Cup final allowed me to easily find a decent job in one of the major Russian companies. <br><br>  And in 2016, I was chosen as the president of the MSP program in Russia. <br><br><h3>  How to become MSP </h3><br>  Becoming a student partner is not at all difficult!  The main thing is the love of technology and the desire to share your knowledge!  We are waiting in our community of active and motivated students for whom technology has become a real passion! <br><br>  To join the community, leave your application <a href="http://msp.pryaniky.com/">on our website</a> . <br>  If you want to know more about the program, are there any partner students in your city, <a href="">please write me</a> with the note ‚ÄúMSP Russia‚Äù. <br><br>  PS I want to express special thanks to Dmitry <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/shwars/" class="user_link">shwars</a> Soshnikova, Anastasia Makeyonok and Olga Shulgina for organizing this fun and productive weekend! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/275985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/275985/</a></p>
