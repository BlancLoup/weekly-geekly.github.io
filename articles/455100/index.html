But if you work with coffee machines, coffee and coffee IT solutions for many years, you forget that some people may not know basic things.  The article ‚Äú <a href="http://habr.com/ru/post/454546">How many programmers do it take to have a cup of coffee</a> ‚Äù reminded me of this. <br><br>  In any profession there is a special kind of immersion, professional deformation.  To feel it, try to remember your condition when you did not know how to read.  Therefore, I seem to repeat for myself the obvious things, but it turns out for many to be a discovery.  The purpose of the article below is to explain how to build a coffee business for offices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rm/es/gx/rmesgxglv0sprmrueksa9a32djg.jpeg" alt="coffee to office">

    <h3>  The foundation of the coffee business, regardless of its location </h3><br>  Any project can have external and internal customers.  When you organize coffee-point at a gas station, in a communication salon, a shopping center, you focus on an external customer.  When creating a coffee zone in an office, you use all the same organizational principles, but adjust them a bit, based on what conditions your internal customer sets for you. <br><br>  <b>The first coffee rule</b> - you can not compromise the quality of coffee.  We need a recognizable, repeatable good taste for a long time.  This goal is achieved in the same way as when selling coffee in advanced filling networks - a good automatic coffee machine, a properly selected grain mix and monitoring the technical condition of the coffee zone.  This is the foundation of the coffee business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8o/6b/io/8o6biokg8_ya9yhgw9_o2fnb3cy.jpeg" alt="office coffee"><br>  <i>Coffee corner in the office</i> <br><br>  In the article, programmers accurately caught the ‚Äúclient‚Äù part of the question - tracking who drank and how much, remembering preferred drinks, drawing prizes.  Absolutely correct way of thinking.  By the way, the direction of thinking of the programmers from this company is correct, they even remembered the prizes for each cup of coffee. <br><br>  Given that the heroes are not yet ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù users of coffee machines, they do not know about the technical component of the process - the service of coffee machines.  Who will do the maintenance (maintenance), repair, in what time and under what conditions?  Even such a simple question can become a stumbling block: ‚ÄúWho will wash the dairy system of the coffee machine every day?‚Äù A trifling matter for 10-15 minutes, but daily.  You can assign an office manager, you can assign a person on duty, you can score and lose the opportunity to drink cappuccino and latte in a couple of months. <br><br>  Or, for example, the coffee machine should be rinsed with special products that should also be bought, otherwise you can try coffee with fairies.  The price of special chemistry is trivial - 12 rubles a day, but how many times did the masters have to clean cars from the effects of saving on consumables ... <br><br>  I give the simplest examples, in fact, the monitoring system takes into account more than 400 parameters of the unit.  A coffee machine is a complex and expensive equipment, for which the manufacturer prescribes a lot of maintenance work aimed at preventing possible damage to the unit.  Good professional equipment designed for decades of work, subject to proper maintenance. <br><br>  The foundation of a strong coffee business for in-line sales of coffee is an automatic coffee machine, a specially selected coffee blend and a whole range of IT solutions aimed at preventing equipment operation. <br><br><h3>  Three whales for the coffee business </h3><br>  If all of the above seemed to be difficult and you really wanted to outsource the coffee issue to the contractor‚Äôs side, that is, not comforting news.  The technical realities of the world for the contractor are also not canceled, but he will solve them at your expense and not always in the most optimal way.  Tested on thousands of coffee points that are connected to our coffee machine monitoring system.  Want to have a delicious coffee, all key issues need to be kept in their hands.  We reveal a rake on the way of office coffee-men. <br><br><h4>  Choosing a coffee machine </h4><br>  First, the coffee machine should be chosen by itself, guided by its own criteria. <br>  The main criterion is automatic coffee preparation.  Neither electric Turks nor professional coffee machines are suitable for office.  This is what programmers caught, but then they let the situation go to the discretion of the enterprising young lady, who offered them a lease of what?  This story is silent.  Four buttons that execute 51 commands are information about nothing.  Korean and Chinese units have a bunch of buttons that can be pressed with full zeal, and they do not affect the operation of the coffee machine.  Italian coffee makers - the story of many unknowns.  There remain 3-4 well-known brands, but they are ‚Äúabove average‚Äù at first glance. <br><br>  You won't even have to spend 30 minutes learning how to use an automatic coffee machine. <br><br><h4>  Choosing a coffee blend </h4><br>  Secondly, the taste of coffee depends on the quality of the coffee blend.  This statement is hard to argue.  I am pretty sure that, along with the long-term rental agreement, the authors also waved the clause of the agreement that they use the grain mixture, which they will supply the owner of the coffee machine.  (Otherwise there is no point in leasing and renting).  So they missed the key point of influencing their coffee without looking. <br><br>  If an office manager will be in charge of coffee for an office coffee machine, they will not win much either.  A good coffee machine is tuned to a specific kind of cereal mixture.  Ideally, the master adjusts monthly settings.  If every kilogram of coffee comes from a new batch of a new manufacturer, then either call the wizard to tune or drink a drink with the taste of coffee.  Here you need to add an item about what kind of milk system in the coffee machine in this configuration?  Delicious coffee is on natural milk.  Is the refrigerator next to the machine or is it a milk package and a tubule? <br><br>  At this stage, maintenance of the coffee machine was not discussed with the contractor, but in vain.  For example, at a brewing temperature of 93.3, perfect coffee is obtained, if you brew a drink with 99-degree boiling water, you will get a bitter burda.  The temperature sets, of course, the master.  The settings even depend on the dishes that will be used - coffee cups or ceramic mugs.  The heat capacity of the ceramic cup is larger and it is customary to warm up the dishes in coffee shops.  It is very nice that the author brought a cup with a saucer from the house, but this is not a guarantee that her coffee will be perfect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jw/ij/xy/jwijxyn7dqlvimqrqdgytwfegbo.jpeg" alt="weekdays customer service, coffee, IT solutions"><br>  <i>Service life</i> <br><br><h4>  Coffee Machine IT Solutions </h4><br>  I can enumerate the nuances for a very long time, the third part is the most interesting for me - IT solutions for servicing a coffee machine.  About the monitoring of the technical condition of the unit, I have already said above, now the ‚Äúclient‚Äù part, what influences the economics of using a coffee machine. <br><br>  The first and most obvious solution is to count the cups drunk in some way.  Programmers are really great, because it came to them on the very first day of owning a coffee machine.  Some gas stations, their heads come to this for years.  IT specialists quickly made their way from a piece of paper and Google tables to automation.  This process should definitely take place without the participation of the "human factor". <br><br>  The next logical step is to identify who drank what coffee.  Resetting 400 rubles for coffee is, in my opinion, an employer‚Äôs frivolity.  But as decided, so decided.  Perhaps the next option - the sale of coffee, such options also exist, and they are implemented with modern technical means.  Special prices are set for their employees, etc.  It is, however, better perceived that "throwing off on coffee and cookies."  Selling coffee by pass is a workable idea.  In some cases, it is more important to protect the coffee machine from unauthorized visitors, then a coffee leave pass also works fine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b4/9i/sb/b49isblnhou3z477zukqma9qg5o.jpeg" alt="coffee by pass, IT"><br>  <i>Access to coffee by pass or check</i> <br><br>  Recognizing a client with a video camera is so much in trend that in America it has already become forbidden to recognize everyone at every corner. <br><br>  What I would have written a bonus for was an idea to think about bonus points from a cup of coffee.  For consumption must be stimulated.  Marketers are not the first time understand how cool it is.  It is immediately obvious that real programmers are working on the result, and not spherical horses in a vacuum.  Business acumen is visible - instantly we are talking about a patent and the desire to ‚Äúcash in‚Äù on neighboring departments who love coffee.  So far, the excitement has not broken with fellow programmers, the HR department urgently prescribes a coffee theme in the company's loyalty policy and implements it. <br><br>  A possible client for such ideas could be the IP-Schnitz, which gave them a car for rent.  But I think that the programmers will ask her so many technical and economic issues that the young lady would prefer to run away from the very smart people and continue to spud tights sellers.  The coffee market is not so full of offers, that such a business curve survives. <br>  The only thing that remains is to add that if programmers, before inventing themselves, studied the question, they would find that all their inventions have already been embodied and have been working for a long time.  <s>If you want to lose weight, ask me how.</s>  Or look what the search engine gives out on the request ‚Äúmonitoring of coffee machines‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  So, in order to have a delicious coffee in the office, you have to choose a coffee machine, a grain mixture and, most flexibly, coffee IT solutions for your needs, according to your requests. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455100/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455100/</a></p>
