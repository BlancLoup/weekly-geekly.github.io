At that time I was the proud owner of the Samsung Galaxy S3 I9300.  Of course, the delivery from the pioneer immediately went to the trash and an excellent product <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.kyle.arliberator">ARLiberator</a> was found.  This program elegantly allows you to control your phone from the radio, displaying on yourself a full screen phone.  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.nkahoang.screenstandby">ScreenStandby</a> was added to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.nkahoang.screenstandby">bundle</a> in order to prevent the phone from discharging.  To this was added the Samsung Galaxy S4 mhl adapter. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/346/f7c/af4/346f7caf45da036285f41afc5c522c45.jpg" alt="image">

      It is very important to use the original adapter, the Chinese adapters immediately begin to fail, snow and green the screen.  Initially, I wanted to use Samsung's AllShare Cast Dongle wireless: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc6/523/4f7/cc65234f7ab814da6bedbe4bc8081aab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After extensive testing, it turned out that if you simultaneously open the navigator and turn on the music, the connection begins to fail and the songs stutter every 10-15 seconds.  Well, to work Arliberator Root is needed.  This whole bundle worked fine and pleased me until a week ago I didn‚Äôt break my phone around the corner of the tile floor.  It was decided to switch to the Galaxy S4. <br><br>  1. It was purchased and flashed with the latest Samsung firmware based on android 4.4.2. <br>  2. Root is received. <br><br>  But nothing worked.  Arliberator did not connect with the machine, and could not pass the built-in tests for performance.  In particular, did not pass the test "Creating a virtual device."  After a long search, it turned out that in the new Android, the SELinux status was changed from more free Permissive to strict Enforcing, which, in turn, even with root, remains limited.  The setenforce 0 command did not help to switch SELinux.  Samsung also sank its KNOX protection system.  All this was a definite plus for ordinary users, bringing Android to iOS closer to security, but this did not satisfy my goals.  After a long search and attempts to develop an algorithm to get rid of this scourge.  Then you can perform the described actions at your own peril and risk.  The author of the article is not responsible for turning your phone into a brick. <br><br>  Yes, and another point: the very first firmware of something non-original causes the KNOX counter to be triggered, which cannot be reset at the moment in any way.  Actuation of the counter, of course, causes Samsung to void the warranty. <br><br>  So, <br><br>  1. A stock firmware was stitched with a cut out KNOX and an added Root (available at w3bsit3-dns.com), through ODIN 3.07 in the PDA field.  Do not forget about all the wipes, including factory reset. <br><br>  For SELinux to switch, the only way for me was the firmware of the modified kernel. <br><br>  2. You need to flash CWM Recovery.  The usual ROM Manager is not enough;  on i9500 it doesn't work: <br><br>  a) Download recovery_version_.img from <a href="http://clockworkmod.com/">clockworkmod.com</a> . <br>  b) Rename the downloaded file to recovery.img <br>  c) Pack it into a tar image using TAR_MD5_PACKAGER (also on w3bsit3-dns.com).  7Zip did not help here. <br>  d) Flash through ODIN in the PDA field. <br><br>  3. Install the program <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dnet.indieroms.OmegaFilesJB">Omega Files</a> and download with it the modified stock kernel for the I9500.  The kernel is assembled from the Samsung source, at least the developer says so. <br><br>  4. Flash the downloaded archive via CWM without unpacking.  Again, not forgetting the wipe. <br><br>  As a result, an almost stock firmware with root and SELinux status was obtained - permissive. <br><br>  The ARLiberator + ScreenStandby bundle was complemented by the excellent <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.nezdroid.mycardashboard">Car Dashboard</a> program, which at the time of connection replaces the Launcher and is convenient for poking at the wheel in the radio tape recorder. <br><br>  The algorithm described by me is certainly compressed, but each of these actions is chewed on many resources, but I have not found such a combination anywhere.  I hope this information will be useful to those who are going to use this radio, as well as for those who are impatient to switch the SELinux mode on the new Samsung. <br><br>  A small addition to the counter: <br>  Perhaps the word counter, I could be misleading.  In fact, the counter was before.  In the I9500, this is already a flag that switches to 1 with unofficial intervention.  Now, KNOX software is responsible for this, which is present not only in rom but also in the bootloader, and as far as is known, it does not allow downgrading the bootloader at the hardware level. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231729/</a></p>
