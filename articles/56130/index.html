And it's not a joke!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.chistov.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/wyglogo.png" alt="image" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="left">  Gnostics Limited Liability Company congratulates habro-people on April 1 (which was celebrated as the first day of Spring in ancient Roman times) and presents a pilot alpha version of the <a href="http://whoyougle.ru/">WhoYOUgle</a> project, a universal non-searchable reference book, for the judgment of fellow Intellectuals.  We hope that it will be easy to deal with its capabilities and functionality, so we will try to identify the goals and objectives of the project. <br><br>  If a solution to the problem of finding texts on the Internet was found in the last millennium, the task functions of the global Web turned out to be more complicated.  For high-quality search results, the English-speaking user goes to Google, the Russian-speaking user goes to Yandex, the Chinese go to Baida, and the Korean goes to Naver, but for non-search inquiries in no other language has such a single address yet emerged.  An advanced user is accustomed to keeping ready (either in the head or in bookmarks) dozens of addresses at which they will transfer dollars to yuan, inches to meters, an Islamic date to Gregorian, decipher TANSTAAFL, tell about domain owners or IP addresses ... The user is less advanced, but stubborn, will begin to search for answers to all these questions in the canonical search engines - and will find, with a certain luck, spending in general more time than we would like.  The other will put on his mobile or desktop reference and converting programs.  And the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of the Network simply will not receive answers to their questions, since they could not ask and did not know the address. <br><br>  Obviously, the solution to the problem is not limited to gathering one hundred reference scripts in one place, and advertising them everywhere.  If everything was so simple, the problem would hardly have survived until April 1, 2009.  Obviously, there is still some kind of fine chemistry in the relationship between a person and an electronic directory that needs to be researched, understood, found, and based on the data of these experiments a convenient universal service where the user could easily and with pleasure get answers to his non-searching questions. .

      To explore this issue we have to work together.  The WhoYOUgle project pilot presented to your attention today is just a prototype of the Universal Directory that we hope to build on this foundation in the foreseeable future.  It's no secret that we are not the first to embark on this path: sites where you can get the services whois, nslookup, whoami, ping, traceroute, recalculate the measure, weight, date or currency, there are more than one thousand in the world.  Including in the Russian market there are several dozens of similar services and software products (including the finest Convertor for iPhone by Vladimir Kofman and the very comprehensive Nolik.Ru).  To collect all this wealth of references under one ‚Äúroof‚Äù so that the user doesn‚Äôt get dizzy and the eyes from all these reference riches run away - the task is obviously non-trivial and difficult.  We at Gnostic LLC expect to solve it with the active assistance of you, the users of the service.  Do not forget about the ‚ÄúComplaints and Suggestions‚Äù link available from each portal page.  We are waiting for your responses, letters, comments, suggestions, rational proposals and ideas for cooperation. <br><br>  Finally, we note the important thing: we are planning to increase the ‚Äúmeat‚Äù to the existing skeleton of the WhoYOUgle project continuously.  New features and capabilities will be added to the service weekly, and new texts in the BASE section - at least 10 times a day.  Part of the future functionality is spelled out in our plans, the other part will be invented in a dialogue with the user, according to his requests. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56130/</a></p>
