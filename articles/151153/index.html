Those.  on Twitter, such posts are written, but a person could barely go on stage for his legitimate prize.  And it so happened that my work over the past few years has been mostly only on the Internet.  And I also constantly experience all the dangers of online closeness. <br><br><img src="http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/383901_426569987389743_264506554_n.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This article is not the answer, but rather the question of how those who live online are struggling with this?

    <a name="habracut"></a>  In my opinion, why can this happen?  Because PS is universal: you can do everything on it, and at the same time, nothing.  He has almost no limits.  Now, with the development of hosting, even the film is better and more convenient to watch online.  Total we get: work, entertainment, even chatting with friends - everything is transferred to online. <br><br>  Because of this versatility, a person cannot decide what to do there, and he jumps on websites, books, mail, Skype, ICQ, YouTube, Rutuba, LJ Lebedev, LJ friends, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  And so the hours pass, and even the days, and the person does not see how time and life pass through his fingers. <br><br>  Online is bad because it does not give physical, namely physical sensations.  After all, we do not consist entirely of thoughts, we have a physical body, ignoring this fact leads to disastrous results, the body pays for its ignore - we take off the ground and fly away to nirvana.  To communicate with friends truly - you need to see them not on Skype and speak out loud to read books - you need to turn the pages and hold a book in your hands (so I think that an e-book is a buzz, that‚Äôs how they can be read and nothing more) to play - you need to rearrange the figures and other trinkets with handles; on the computer can be). <br><br>  In this regard, sales of all kinds of office toys, such as <a href="http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/ruwiki/1440770">neokuba</a> , <a href="http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/ruwiki/1353811">chewing gum for hands</a> , puzzles made of wood and plastic, etc., that use fine motor skills, are booming. <br><br>  So, in my opinion, you can do: <br><br>  1. Read books.  No, not the ones that are online.  And those that hold in their hands, the weight of which you feel in your hand, rustle pages and smell of paint or old stuff. <br><br>  2. Start the animal.  Any  Be it a cat, dog, parrot, dormouse, gopher, hamster, fish, turtles, rats, boas?  (although a very profitable beast - feed once a month and do not need to be cleaned). <br><br>  3. Write a diary.  This diary, in a notebook, written with a ballpoint pen.  I will not talk about the usefulness of this lesson, a lot has been written about this by psychologists.  I can only say that tactile sensations are again important here, and it is important to write with your hand, and not to knock on the keys.  At least a few lines, but every day.  Here it is possible to write in a specially purchased good notepad, specially purchased with a beautiful pen, beautiful handwriting. <br><br>  4. Physical work.  It is not a luxury, if you live in a city, it is a necessity.  Any suitable, especially where you need to cut, plane, hammer nails.  If the housework can often get bored, then there must be some kind of adult technical toy.  I, for example, have a car that needs to be brought to mind and repaired.  And when you start messing with it, you feel like a car mechanic, when you have done something, the pleasant physical feeling of the work done is very good.  And this joy is not only in the head, but also, which is important, in the muscles. <br><br>  5. Sport.  More precisely any physical exercise.  Cliches work for our people right away: but you need a gym, but iron, but simulators, a trainer and a lot of equipment are needed.  No, get at home what you want (horizontal bar, Swedeswoman, hanging bars, dumbbells, barbells), or do not start.  Put yourself a push-up rate, do a press, crouch, everything you can do with your own body without shells.  Just give it a tough 10-15 minutes a day - and regardless of the mood you need to do. <br><br>  6. Go to nature.  Just do not go for drinking drinks and eating kebabs, namely, to walk, to <a href="http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_philosophy/3336/%25D0%25A1%25D0%259E%25D0%2597%25D0%2595%25D0%25A0%25D0%25A6%25D0%2590%25D0%259D%25D0%2598%25D0%2595">contemplate</a> nature.  Yes, it is to <a href="http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc3p/276162">contemplate</a> , very often people may not notice any, even beautiful, nature just under the house, nature needs to be looked at, and not viewed as pictures on Facebook in a slideshow.  Contemplation is looking at the <a href="http://psychology.academic.ru/312/%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">attention</a> , without fuss - the most important thing is without fuss, haste, <a href="http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_philosophy/1427/%25D0%25AD%25D0%259F%25D0%259E%25D0%25A5%25D0%2595">without judgments about the subject of contemplation</a> , to look at something.  If there is a park, go to the park, if not - periodically go somewhere.  But take a break from asphalt and geometric shapes.  Someone is playing airsoft, but this is an expensive toy, and not everyone can afford it, in a word it is necessary to find something related to wildlife. <br><br>  7. Go to the bath (bath).  Strange as it may sound, contact with water also lands.  It also cannot be ignored and it is necessary to wash, not because of dirt, but because it is simply necessary for physical contact with a part of this physical world. <br><br>  Being stuck in something is always bad, even in your favorite business, and when ‚Äúyou are stuck in the matrix‚Äù is also not very good.  Online bribes me with its ease, adaptability, ‚Äúmagic and wonders of the future,‚Äù but I do not live online, but in the physical world. <br><br>  The general principle in my opinion is this: more physical contacts with reality (do you want to fight or what?) <br><br>  How do you fight <a href="http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/ruwiki/645594">cyber socialization</a> ?  What else would you add to the list? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151153/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151153/</a></p>
