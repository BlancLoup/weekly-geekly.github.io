  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Are you ready to complain?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably there is no company for which there would be no complaints about the work of technical support.  Habr√© has a lot of articles on how to organize the work of this most important service, optimize the processing of calls and tickets.  Constantly discussed how to reduce the response time to treatment.  And if you look from the other side?  How much do the users who apply for technical support make their problem solved as quickly as possible? <br><br>  Even if we fold, say, software incompatibility, weird settings, etc ... Up to a third of system administrators are confronted with questions, one way or another.  What do you think, what percentage of users immediately provides all the information needed to solve a problem?  Or at least ready to constructively discuss the problem?  Often up to the moment when it comes to specific recommendations, 7-10 iterations take place!  The dialogue with the client is underway, and at this time the encrypter may well continue his work. <br><br>  All examples for this article are taken from real requests.  Spelling and punctuation saved, mate and personal information removed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Hello. <br>  Missing file: <br>  /var/.../.pid <br>  Please send. </blockquote><br>  1. Are you ready for the incident?  In Russia, as you know, every snow that falls is a surprise.  But the list of problems for which you need to contact technical support is likely to be finite.  Moreover, an even shorter list of what needs to be provided to technical support staff to solve the problem.  In most cases, this is complete information about the system, information about the product version and its settings, the logs of the product.  However, the overwhelming number of requests do not contain such information, and it takes not only the time of technical support staff, but also - most importantly - the time of the client itself.  Meanwhile, the virus may well continue to work.

    <blockquote>  I got a strange virus!  I can not remove it!  What is this virus, and how to remove it, please tell me! </blockquote><br>  Respectively: <br><ol><li>  The company should have a well-known and enforced procedure by the order of the management, according to which it is possible to gather all the necessary information in the shortest time.  Exactly.  Holidays are a typical example.  New Year and May.  Two weeks at work there is no one.  Do you think attackers do not use this?  The administrator is on vacation, his partner was in the hospital.  Typical situation? <br>  At any time, the duty officer of the company, including the secretaries (there were quite precedents when problems were resolved with the help of these lovely girls), contacts should be available to those who need to call and write in case of a problem.  Who can be called to work in the event of a problem, how to get access to such and such data, where to click, in order for the employee to collect the report. </li><li>  Find out in advance where to call for what problem and what information to collect.  Already mentioned <a href="http://antifraud.drweb.ru/encryption_trojs">cryptographers</a> .  The problem is known to all, but almost no one knows <a href="http://legal.drweb.ru/encoder">what needs</a> to <a href="http://legal.drweb.ru/encoder">be</a> sent to the antivirus company.  A maximum of one file is applied.  And then just a screenshot. </li><li>  Track news.  Cases are different.  Phones and contact persons change periodically. <br></li></ol><br>  2. Be prepared to provide the necessary information.  Certain actions are often requested (before the treatment of files, now decrypted), but they are not ready to provide information, as it contains some kind of commercial secret.  In the extreme case, the information is not provided in principle: ‚ÄúI called, you must solve the problem and I don‚Äôt want to send anything, let's answer‚Äù. <br><br>  Respectively: <br><ol><li>  Be mentally prepared for the fact that the incident will suffer important information and to restore it will need to be transferred to a certain organization.  Prepare appropriate contract templates - not all companies are ready to accept model contracts from other companies. </li><li>  In advance, worry about the possibility of collecting such information in the company.  At a minimum, heads of departments should be notified of this need. </li><li>  Have all the necessary utilities on hand. </li><li>  Lawyers should be included in the response team. <br></li></ol><br>  3. Turning to technical support, understand what you want to achieve.  For example, in the case of malware infection - whether you want to simply treat the system, transmit the virus you found, get advice, or investigate the incident.  The procedures for action will be completely different. <br><br>  Remember, incorrectly defining the purpose of the request, you may not just spend your time and resources, but also make it impossible to obtain the true goal.  For example, collecting evidence for submission to court. <br><br>  4. Do not start treatment with aggression.  Technical support staff most likely do not have any connection with the problem that you had.  Moreover, they, as a rule, do their best to solve your problem ‚Äî you cannot see the correspondence that arises about your problem between departments.  And it is absolutely unacceptable mate. <br><br><blockquote>  15 minutes ago I had your product xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxx <br>  I used it for more than two months like <br><br>  it is too independent, and it was at that moment when I needed the performance of my i7 with 8 GB of RAM, it choked my car, and even killing 40 minutes trying to figure out where it was going to go out, I found solutions.  the day before yesterday I had to go to bed at half past night  he broke all the work for me, which remained for 15 minutes <br><br>  just a bastard of some kind, and not a convenient anti-virus product, worse - biiiip <br><br>  Never in my life will I put it again! <br><br>  adios dear support staff <br>  good luck to you <br>  - Purpose of use: Protect your home computer / laptop <br>  Operating system: N / A <br>  Selected product: N / A <br>  Serial number / license key file number: <br></blockquote><br>  No product version, no system version, no problem description ... <br><br>  Naturally, the request will be disassembled and a polite response will be given in due time.  But what do you think, which request will be processed last? <br><br>  Moreover, polite treatment with a description of the problem, at least, will be communicated to developers, marketers or other professionals.  A message without the necessary information is likely to disappear in vain.  And is it worth it? <br><br>  Respectively: <br><ol><li>  Stick to the facts and drop the emotions. </li><li>  If the problem is solved, thank the one who helped you.  People handle dozens of requests per day and are overwhelmed by negative treatment.  Make it nice. <br></li></ol><br>  5. Do what is asked of you, speak (write) competently and clearly.  If the instruction is sent to you, believe me, it is written if not with blood, then with experience of customer problems and knowledge of the nuances of the systems operation.  But, oddly enough, in response to the request may well come at all that.  Execution of the requested for some reason is considered optional! <br><br>  Respectively: <br><ol><li>  Your request is your time.  Unfortunately, high-quality tambourines are not produced now, and it is possible to find out what is happening with you only with your help. </li><li>  You should not use slang, terminology of your industry, abbreviations, etc.  You may well not understand and provide not what you need to solve the problem. <br></li></ol><br>  6. Complain where needed.  As practice shows, what would happen - the antivirus is to blame.  However, even in the case of software conflicts, this is not always the case.  Often, a different company may be to blame for violating the same RFC.  There is naturally a guilty one, but time, time ... <br><br>  Do not look for solutions where there are no experts.  Often, for help from the same coders, with problems on the brakes, etc.  Turn anywhere, but not in technical support.  The problem will not be solved, but who will be to blame? <br><br>  And at the same time.  Yes, a license without technical support is cheaper.  Essentially.  But if you bought such a license - you deliberately made your choice, you should not blame the soulless employees who do not want to help you.  Their salary is made up of money that was paid for licenses. <br><br>  7. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/devexpress/blog/10486">If you managed to find the answer to your question first, do not forget to report this to the person you asked.</a>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/devexpress/blog/10486">This will allow him not to waste time and add loyalty to you if you turn to this person with a different question in the future</a> .  Your decision may well help those who turn after you. <br><br>  All the above rules are quite simple and hopefully they will allow you to reduce the time to solve your problem.  Moreover, a quick and competent analysis of the situation will help not only you, but also other victims - often at the time of epidemics, the tracker just chokes on requests.  Your help in finding a new Trojan may well be critical, and the time freed up by a tech support employee as a result of a quick analysis of the situation may well be spent on helping someone who is supercritical at the moment. <br><br>  Information security often does not depend on the cost of purchased software, but on the readiness for a certain situation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260287/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260287/</a></p>
