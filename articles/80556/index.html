      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

        </script>
      <br>
      At the moment, a schedule of transportation servers.  Moving will take place on the 14th, 18th and 21st of January. <br><br>  We ask you to promptly (by January 13th) send to col@agava.com the information necessary for transportation: <br>  - convenient for you the date of the move (14th, 18th and 21st of January); <br>  - server number; <br>  - authorization data. <br><br>  If information with wishes on the move is not provided on time, we will be forced to set a date at our discretion.  During the move the server will not be available approximately from 7 to 19 hours. <br><br>  For the server to work successfully in the new data center, you will need to change the network settings for the server.  The necessary settings for the servers under our administration will be made by our specialists.  For servers located in their own administration, the necessary settings will be sent individually to the contact e-mail. <br>  " <br><br>  Maybe I do not understand what, but I think it's just a tin.  Move from 7 to 19 hours, that is, all day.  There are servers on which at least 50 clients. <br><br>  What do you think? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br><br>  No, this is not a layout, they send a letter when registering: <br><br>  "Hello! <br><br>  Thank you for renting a dedicated server. <br><br>  For any operations with the server through the technical <br>  support (reboot, install software, add zones to DNS, etc.) in <br>  The body of the letter must specify the administrative username, password and number <br>  server.  This password is not related to the services of your server, but <br>  used only for submitting applications.  Without authorization information <br>  no actions will be performed on the server. <br><br>  {Login: Password} <br>  " <br><br>  <b>UPD 2</b> <br><br>  Before proceeding, I want to say the following: <br><br>  Our company has been a client of Agave for a couple of years.  During this time, anything happened, but nothing out of the ordinary.  It was when the cooling system failed on a non-primary server and it was falling for almost a week.  As a result, he had a problem with the hard drive that I had to repair myself through KVM.  Linux on the same server was set somehow crooked, but this is also not so critical.  Just a couple of days for 2 years of work, even for the last 2 months. <br><br>  In spite of all the above, I can say <b>much</b> more bad about other companies that I had to work with over the same years before that.  Therefore, I would like to apologize for some not reticent comments in the comments, I repeat, the purpose of this post is to understand the situation and share experiences, and not to look for a whipping boy. <br><br><h3>  Called from Agave </h3><br><br>  It was reported that the primary server can be moved in February, and the secondary one this month.  Information on IP addresses has not yet been given and said nothing more.  We will understand further.  They are also now finding out why the letter was sent just now. <br><br>  Here I can only say that it is better for customers to call for such questions in two weeks, rather than send letters and be ready to answer questions about address distribution, if you already knew a month ago that you will be moving servers and cannot save subnets. <br><br>  Yes, for one thing - well, 1 free hour of KVM per day when I fully administer the server is somehow not great.  Since such problems arise, you need to somehow go to the meeting and buy a few more kvm-s. <br><br><h4>  Epilogue </h4><br>  Perhaps, in this situation, I will have time to configure the mirroring of the main projects on the migrated server.  Explain to our customers that 99% uptime, a contract and anything like that is certainly an option, but not for us.  We are not such a big company to leave 60 customers a day without their sites and explain to all of them.  We do not have enough phones. <br><br>  If there is a new information, I will probably write it in a new post, otherwise there is already a mess in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80556/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80556/</a></p>
