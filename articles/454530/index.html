This device can carry a video camera and take down what is happening below from the air.  However, unlike all other models of copters, this drone, called DJI Storm, is not for sale, but it can be rented. <br><br>  As far as one can understand, a team of operators, additional accessories and a truck that can carry it all is attached with the drone.  The drone is positioned by the company as a professional device intended for filming. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Perhaps, with its help, the Chinese company will be able to enter the high-tech cinema market.  Now filming from the air is already being conducted by different companies, but for this purpose a variety of devices are used, including ordinary copters and helicopters.  DJI Storm is more functional than most other models.  One of the differences is that most multicopters are not able to lift and hold a professional video camera in the air, since its mass is very large.

      True, there are solutions, but they are still small.  One of the examples of flying robots that are still able to fly with a full-fledged camera is Aerigon multicopter.  Now this company has a competitor, which is quite dangerous, since renting a drone is much cheaper than buying similar equipment.  Immediately after the announcement of the DJI Storm, the company announced that it was possible to rent the services of a film crew. <br><br>  The eight-rotor drone, it was created according to the quadcopter scheme, having two rotors installed on each of the arms.  According to the developers, this scheme of installation of rotors makes it possible not only to increase traction, but also to ensure the safety of equipment.  In a normal situation, if a copter blade fails, then it falls, dropping expensive equipment.  Professional cameras cost tens of thousands of dollars, which is quite a substantial amount even for relatively wealthy studios.  Well, DJI Storm, if one of the electric motors fails, will simply smooth the load to the ground.  As a result, neither the vehicle nor the equipment of filmmakers will suffer. <br><br>  As mentioned above, it is planned to rent a specialized truck, which is able to accommodate the drone, cameras, and the crew team. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iNtfYyVAZc0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  As for the technical characteristics, the multikopter is equipped with a built-in Ronin 2 hanger (only its cost is $ 8,000).  It can lift the air payload weighing up to 18.5 kilograms.  The video above shows how it flies freely with the heavy ARRI Alexa LF camera.  It can work at air temperatures from -10 to +40 degrees Celsius.  The maximum speed is 80 kilometers per hour.  In the air, it can spend 8-15 minutes, subject to the use of a replaceable battery.  In principle, for filming most episodes on top of this is enough. <br><br>  To work with the drone, the developer suggests using professional remotes of models Master Wheels and Force Pro. <br><br>  Nothing is known about the cost of the service, the company only said that renting all the equipment would be cheaper than buying a professional drone for filming.  In addition, it is unclear whether this drone will be sold in retail, or will remain part of the rental service. <br><br>  By the way, the cost of a professional drone Matrice 600, which is capable of carrying about 6 kg of cargo is $ 5000.  The new copter is faster, more powerful, plus it is more functional. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454530/</a></p>
