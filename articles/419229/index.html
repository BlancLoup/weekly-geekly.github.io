However, creators of podcast platforms often fail to monetize their audio applications in a similar fashion. <br><br>  However, another player appeared on the audio application market with ‚Äúconversational‚Äù content that successfully earns revenue through the sale of subscriptions.  This is a meditation application.

      Let us see what is similar, and how these players differ in this niche of audio content. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/419229/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/np/5o/7v/np5o7vw3uzkqrw0jaolxhqwhx00.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tinaleggio/15516383916/">Tina Leggio</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  What happened to the market for audio applications </h2><br>  For several years, podcasting applications have only been striving to create a universal platform with a paid subscription using the Netflix model, meditation applications already succeed.  This fact is primarily noted by investors - so they are more willing to invest in the segment of applications with ‚Äúmeditative‚Äù audio content. <br><br>  For comparison: the most successful platforms for podcasts with the function of a paid subscription received investments of no more than $ 36 million (investors invested $ 35.2 million in <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/castbox-fm">Acast</a> , and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/castbox-fm">$</a> 29.6 million in <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/castbox-fm">Castbox</a> ).  At the same time, the volume of investments in the most successful meditation application with a paid subscription - <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/headspace%2523section-overview">Headspace</a> - is 75.2 million. <br><br>  The market assessment of the two largest companies in the field of audio content for meditations - <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/meditation-app-calm-hits-a-250m-valuation-amid-an-explosion-of-interest-in-mindfulness-apps/">Calm</a> and <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/06/30/headspace-funding/">Headspace</a> - exceeds $ 250 million for each.  Platforms for podcasts on this indicator are also lagging behind - the same Acast is <a href="https://rainnews.com/acast-plans-public-offering-ross-adams-is-new-ceo">estimated</a> ‚Äúonly‚Äù at 131 million dollars. <br><br>  Although there is a criterion by which the podcast segment still finds itself in a better position, the cumulative volume of the audience of listeners.  The podcast industry in Western countries is quite developed: according to a 2018 Infinite Dial study, 26% of Americans (73 million people) <a href="https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/">listen to</a> podcasts at least once a month.  Acast's UK study found that 23% of the population (15.1 million people) at least once listened to podcasts in the month preceding the survey. <br><br>  Compared to these figures, the audience for meditation applications is not yet so large: Headspace <a href="https://www.headspace.com/health-press-release">claims</a> that almost 30 million people around the world use their services, and Calm <a href="https://blog.calm.com/life-at-calm/">cites a</a> figure of 25 million users. <br><br><h2>  How does the market for meditation applications live? </h2><br>  Despite the fact that among the users of the application for meditation are not so widespread, this does not prevent them from actively capturing the market of audio content.  Services for meditation and awareness raising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/18/meditation-resource-calm-raises-another-500000-for-an-app-that-helps-you-focus-de-stress-and-sleep/">are gaining popularity</a> over the past few years, but in 2017 and 2018 this growth has accelerated.  In 2017, Calm was <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/best-of-2017/apps-of-the-year/">included</a> in the list of the best applications of the year from Apple, and attention to mental health became one of the trends of the year according to the company. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://blog.apptopia.com/self-care-apps-growing">Apptopia</a> , the number of downloads of the 10 most popular self-care applications increased by 36% compared to the same period last year, and the revenue by 40%.  Applications can popularize meditation and make it a part of people's daily lives.  In total, according to the estimates of the American organization National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, 8% of adults (18 million people) <a href="https://nccih.nih.gov/research/statistics/NHIS/2012/mind-body/meditation">practice</a> meditation. <br><br>  Most meditation applications are a selection of audio instructions for a particular situation and time.  Some services can create recommendations based on the user's emotions and well-being.  Therefore, the primary model for monetization of meditation applications is a premium subscription.  It works because users are willing to pay for: 1) selection of content for specific needs and 2) a convenient service that does not require them to independently search for audio. <br><br><h2>  What podcast apps do they make </h2><br>  Unlike meditation applications, the podcast platform is practically not involved in content curation and in facilitating the task of finding a suitable podcast for the situation / mood.  Of course, podcasts can be grouped by subject, but the platform will not offer a release that suits your mood or well-being. <br><br>  This is primarily due to the fact that services for listening to podcasts for the most part act as aggregators of content, which is created by independent authors.  Due to this approach, on the one hand, there are more audio recordings on the platform, on the other hand, it is almost impossible to manage them at the level accessible to meditation applications. <br><br>  In this situation, both the authors and the platforms themselves are trying to make money on audio content.  Podcasters often include native advertisements in their editions or accept donations from fans.  Platforms attract advertisers and experiment with subscription models.  For example, for a monthly fee, provide users with early access to releases of their favorite podcasts, bonus materials, and the lack of advertising in the application itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sk/vh/bj/skvhbjjvmagmqz3c9wi9c8rbzzc.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/165719418%40N08/43329867122/">Kertojan √§√§ni</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br>  However, so far there are few people who want to get such access, and generally pay monthly for podcasts.  This is also due to the fact that listeners may not associate the platform with ‚Äúits content‚Äù, and are ready to support individual podcasters, but not an aggregator application. <br><br><h2>  What happens to the audio industry in Russia </h2><br>  Users of audio applications in Russia are not as well studied as abroad.  For our market, we have not yet conducted large-scale studies on the number of listeners to podcasts and audio meditations, therefore it is difficult to estimate the exact volume of the industry. <br><br>  They began to write actively about applications for meditation and awareness in Russian from 2015‚Äì2016 [ <a href="https://vc.ru/11065-it-meditations">vc.ru</a> , <a href="https://daily.afisha.ru/brain/2246-10-prilozheniy-dlya-borby-so-stressami-i-fobiyami/">Poster</a> , <a href="https://meduza.io/cards/kak-nachat-zanimatsya-meditatsiey-i-zachem">Meduza</a> ].  However, despite the growing popularity, application developers do not support the trend of increasing the ‚Äúlanguage accessibility‚Äù of audio meditation for Russians.  Among the popular applications, lessons in Russian can be found, perhaps, only in <a href="https://insighttimer.com/">Insight Timer</a> . <br><br>  Podcasts in Russia are much more common and well known.  The main models of monetization of audio transmissions in Russia, as well as in the West, are advertising and donations.  Advertisers are now <a href="https://incrussia.ru/understand/podkasty-vernulis-kak-zabytyj-format-poluchil-vtoroe-rozhdenie/">working</a> with the largest and oldest of the programs.  In addition, Russian podcasters <a href="https://vc.ru/32882-podcasts-ads">sell</a> their other services and courses or arrange a paid participation on the air to guests. <br><br>  As for the paid subscription model, Arzamas implements it on its platform, for example: some of the materials in the <a href="https://arzamas.academy/radio">application are</a> available for free, and the subscription opens unique content for users.  However, in this case, we still do not deal with the platform-aggregator of third-party content, but with supervised content provided by the site itself. <br><br>  By the way, ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù <a href="https://tjournal.ru/70855-vkontakte-anonsirovala-poyavlenie-platformy-podkastov-i-novye-oprosy">plans to</a> launch its service for hosting podcasts by the end of 2018.  The company does not yet tell about the earnings model, but it is known that it will differ from the existing monetization of audio recordings in the social network.  Perhaps the domestic market will become the launching pad where platforms for podcasts will still be able to launch the ‚Äúaudio-Netflix‚Äù format. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>What else do we have on the topic:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/podcasts/">Audio Podcasts: Sound in Simple Words</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4737.html">"Talk Show": How to create, develop and listen to podcasts</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5242.html">"Good morning, Vietnam!": How to start your Internet radio</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/sou-zvuk-vigorous-space/id731089874">Sound is our audio podcast in iTunes</a> </li></ul><br><hr><br> <font color="#A9A9A9"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></font>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Our microformat - Telemania <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/">channel</a> "Audiomania"</i></font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419229/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419229/</a></p>
