    <h1>  <b>Software Development Outsourcing</b> </h1><br>  When it comes to software development outsourcing, there are several key points that need to be discussed and approved with the selected service provider.  If you make sure that the developer imagines the project in the same way as you and has clear expectations, this will lay the foundation for successful collaboration. <br><br><h2>  <b>Eight key points to consider when choosing an outsourcing service provider</b> </h2><br><ol><li>  <b>Make sure that the service provider includes everything you need in the design and estimate documentation.</b> <br>  Important steps in the development process: <br><ul><li>  Analysis or specification </li><li>  Projection </li><li>  Layout </li><li>  Architecture and design </li><li>  Development of program code </li><li>  Documenting code </li><li>  Software test results </li><li>  Deploying code to the customer‚Äôs server </li><li>  Service </li><li>  Training </li></ul>  If any of these points is missing, it is recommended to agree with the service provider the procedure for responsibility for it.  So you will know in advance exactly what to expect from the supplier. </li><li>  <b>Do not underestimate the importance of technical specification, if the service provider recommends to create it.</b> <br>  Developing a comprehensive technical specification for your project can significantly reduce costs in the long run.  In addition, the developer will be able to clearly understand what exactly is required to include in the final version of the developed software, and what is not. <br><br>  Technical specifications will not only prevent the service provider from wasting too much time on adding unnecessary features, but also help reduce errors.  A few years ago, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published a report that software errors cost the United States economy $ 59.5 billion annually. Even for an individual project, it is easy to imagine a price increase that a little confusion or a missing element in the development process will lead to. <br><br>  It is impossible to take into account all the errors, but the creation of clear specifications from the very beginning will avoid some of them and save money that otherwise would have been spent on unnecessary development.  Therefore, if the service provider recommends starting with the creation of a technical specification, do not think that he simply wants to make you spend more.  On the contrary, perhaps he wants to help you save in case of any misunderstanding about the requirements for the project. </li><li>  <b>Make sure the service provider documents the code.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74c/f2a/bca/74cf2abca374486dadab4c72170752c9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Extreme clarity in understanding developer code is important when further customizing or correcting errors.  Without a clear understanding of what exactly and how the original developer thought, you can get confused and lose time trying to identify bugs and understand what has already been done on the project. <br><br>  Make sure that the service provider creates comprehensive and clear documentation that gives other people, who will have to work with the code later, a clear understanding of the development process.  A few notes here and there are not enough, the documentation should contain a complete and detailed explanation of the process of writing code. </li><li>  <b>Ensure that the assets used by the service provider do not infringe anyone‚Äôs intellectual property rights.</b> <br>  Violation of such rights could potentially become a very serious and costly problem, especially if the software is used or sold for commercial purposes.  Such situations can lead to the initiation of administrative or even criminal cases with serious fines. <br><br>  <b>How to prevent this?</b> <br>  If instead of developing a project from scratch, your service provider recommends acquiring the source code of an existing application and converting it into a new unique project, it is important to learn how to avoid potential legal problems. <br><ul><li>  First, the code must be acquired legally from a reliable supplier. </li><li>  Secondly, you need to check what exactly the acquisition agreement allows you to do with the code ‚Äî modify and use it for your own needs or simply distribute the modified version. </li><li>  Thirdly, you should make sure that the purchased material will be modified enough to be considered a new product. </li></ul><br>  Most software projects involve not only the creation of clean software code, but also the development of beautiful design.  Therefore, it is important to immediately ensure that the service provider is not going to use the work of other designers.  If he is going to purchase images, ask him to submit payment documents.  If he uses free images, you need to make sure that it does not violate any property rights. <br><br>  However, you should consider how the software will withstand the competition.  If you feel that your service provider may in the future develop something similar for other customers, then it will not be superfluous to issue intellectual property rights.  Make sure that these clauses are reflected in the service agreement that you are going to sign.  Carefully read the agreement sent by the supplier and, if necessary, seek the assistance of a lawyer. </li><li>  <b>Check if the service provider is ready to give you an independent test of the product.</b> <br>  Have you ever heard the phrase "trust but verify"?  This is an absolute rule that must be followed when outsourcing software development.  Over time, you can begin to trust the supplier, but it is very important to verify the results yourself.  So you can not only calm down and make sure that the service provider has completed the project properly, but also to check the software from the user's point of view.  You may find something the developer has missed, an unintended error, or just a piece of code that needs to be improved. </li><li>  <b>Make sure the service provider gives you the opportunity to participate in the process.</b> <br>  Participation in the development process will never be over.  So you will get a deeper understanding of the whole process, understand how the project was done, and also be able to monitor its progress and the time spent on it. <br><ul><li>  Project Management Systems </li><li>  Alternatives for working time </li></ul></li><li>  <b>Ask your service provider if they will provide you with the necessary assistance after the project is released.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0c/1e2/84f/e0c1e284f5f346749ca0520c1728878d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After receiving the final software product from the supplier, you may need additional assistance.  How to use this product, how to work with it? <br><br>  If something more informal suits you, then a Skype call or communication with an Internet service provider may be enough.  If the software is more complex, it is better to ask the service provider to also provide you with a user manual, video or detailed instructions at the time of the final delivery.  The willingness of the service provider to provide you with the necessary assistance upon completion of the project is of great importance, therefore if he does not refuse, this becomes an additional advantage. </li><li>  <b>Make sure the service provider is ready to communicate with you during the development process.</b> <br>  A clear and consistent communication solves many of the problems encountered and helps prevent others.  Try to communicate frequently with all participants in the development process and do not be afraid to remind you of key points, even if you have discussed them before. </li></ol><br><br><h2>  <b>Verification of trust in service providers</b> </h2><br>  <b>Local software developers</b> <br>  Working with a local service provider has some advantages, because  you can interact personally and visit the physical office of the developer.  Sometimes at a personal meeting you can understand something about a person or company that it is difficult to feel by email, Skype or through other Internet channels of communication.  In addition, you can find local customers with whom your provider has already worked, and they can tell you their opinion on the total cost of services and share their own experiences. <br><br>  Although working with a local service provider really simplifies the research process, you still need to find online comments, feedback and information about its activities.  This service provider may be local to you, but it works nationally or even internationally, so you can find its ratings and reviews on third-party websites. <br><br>  <b>Foreign software developers</b> <br><br>  There is no reason to avoid attracting foreign developers even to large projects.  In the course of such cooperation, you can meet talented people and save a significant amount.  In addition, if you spend a little time, you can find on the Internet previous work and reviews of any successful developer.  On the Internet, there are many possible sources of information about the service provider you want to hire.  The IAOP, for example, publishes a rating of one hundred best outsourcing service providers each year.  This rating is great for finding a company that does high quality work at a reasonable price and with minimal problems. <br><br>  You can also visit independent review sites, for example, Clutch <br><br>  Another promising IT outsourcing portal is Resiport, which is now in beta. <br><br>  Freelance Internet exchanges serve as additional sources of information about service providers.  Here are a few of them: Elance, Upwork, Peopleperhour, Guru. <br><br>  Often service providers already have their profiles on the above sites.  These profiles can contain valuable information and feedback on past work and service quality.  In addition, you can use social networks, such as Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn, to explore the profiles, comments and messages of providers.  Information can also be found on specialized forums directly or indirectly related to outsourcing service providers. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  If you do the whole process correctly, outsourcing software development can be a dynamic tool to reduce costs, save time and gain additional work experience.  If you manage the process correctly and eventually find several outsourcing service providers you can trust, you can take full advantage of all the possibilities of outsourcing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300582/</a></p>
