  <section class="page js-page"><h1>1–°: Programmers Club - Teacher‚Äôs View</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I really did not want to go to the Planetarium after the repair.  I was sure that commercial entertainment was done from the temple of astronomical science.  Partly the way it happened, but astronomy, albeit with a small letter, still remained, and the entertainment turned out just awesome! <br>  Now the Planetarium, like the Zoo next door, cannot be avoided at once.  I got to the Star Hall as the head of one of the projects of the final contest for mobile applications.  And this summer, participants from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1c_club/blog/265817/">1C: Summer School</a> , in which I also taught, went to Lunarium. <br>  During the year, IT classes are held with students.  I work in several schools.  Therefore, I have the opportunity to compare and I can advise. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Everybody </h1><br>  1C: The club is arranged, in my opinion, in exact accordance with the general principles of the company ( <a href="http://www.1c.ru/rus/firm1c/firm1c.htm">http://www.1c.ru/rus/firm1c/firm1c.htm</a> ), the main of which is: ‚ÄúFocus on meeting the real needs of the mass user.‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="http://club.1c.ru/">1C: The club of programmers</a> is suitable for many schoolchildren.  Probably everyone wants to feel like a representative of the elite, and not the "masses".  But brilliant people are born very rarely, but they come by their own work and with the help of teachers to serious life success - many.  1C: The club gives the opportunity to start anyone.  There are no entrance exams.  And those who could be screened out by rigorous selection have a good opportunity to begin their way here into the world of computer technology magic.  No intermediate exams - "fly out for academic failure" is almost impossible. <br>  What can we say about the quality of training in this case?  Frankly, the quality of this, of course, worse than in schools with constant monitoring and dropout.  But this is not very important.  Why, I will say a little later.

    <h1>  About everything </h1><br>  Perhaps even more important is the question of how to be someone who does not ‚Äúpull‚Äù? <br>  And here 1C: Club has a wonderful and simple solution.  Many courses designed for different IT interests and character traits.  Intellectual-prone, offer a course of algorithms, Olympiad programming.  Creative design skills can be developed on the course of project programming.  Able to "work with their hands," fascinates the course of system administration.  Pragmatists who want to secure guaranteed bread and butter for themselves in the future choose the preparation courses for the Unified State Exam and the language of the 1C: Enterprise 8 platform - a gold mine for Russian programmers.  Ambitious young people who present themselves as future leaders (programmers' teams, of course!) Become familiar with the subject of their future activities in the course of the Office for Developing Software Projects. <br><br><h1>  Forever and ever </h1><br>  Often supplementary education is limited to the annual rate.  A lot of 1C courses for schoolchildren gives you the opportunity to study for several years. <br>  More precisely, the word "learn" is not very suitable.  When I first started teaching at 1C, it was also at 1C: Summer School, I was surprised by the words of one of the leaders about the importance of sandwiches.  ‚ÄúWhat other‚Äú sandwiches ‚Äù?  Is this a programming school ?! ‚Äù  Firm "1C" - as a hospitable home - there is always tasty food!  The point, of course, is not the sliced ‚Äã‚Äãsausage, but in relation to the club.  For many children, this is a house where you can eat, program, play games and socialize.  As in any home, children grow up and some become ... teachers, that is, they stay at the club for a very long time. <br><br><h1>  Large print </h1><br>  Yes, classes are paid.  The second important principle of the company "1C" says: "To work profitably." <br>  But in principle, there is no free education.  Someone still pays at least to the teachers.  It is important where revenues go.  Almost all the incomes of 1C: Club go to pay teachers, advertisements, gifts to club members, and organize special events.  That is, 1C: The club actually only pays for itself. <br>  Ask people furiously fighting for free education (I will be the first one!) If they are ready to work for free?  Personally, I ... In 1C: Club - yes!  But not for long.  To work with high quality, with full dedication, you need the consciousness that you are valued.  A salary - one of these estimates. <br>  Often outraged by the fact of payment, and not the amount.  But, if it is really worth it, and, it seems to me, the lessons in 1C are worth it, why not pay? <br>  Moreover, paid classes have one obvious advantage - it forms a serious attitude to classes both among students and parents.  If you like it - the student will not miss, because he is "reluctant today."  If something is not pleasant - parents have a serious reason to be indignant - and life in the club will become better. <br><br><h1>  What to choose? </h1><br>  Honestly I do not know.  I personally choose, that is, to leave one thing, did not dare. <br>  On weekdays, I enjoy teaching programming in schools 179 and Second, and in the evening I read Android development course.  With a serious selection, constant monitoring, various ratings. <br>  But on Saturday evening I will definitely go to 1C: Club for inspiration from creative projects, the diversity of the world of computer technology and ... sandwiches. <br>  It was this combination that gave me the opportunity to visit the entire Planetarium this summer.  But this is me, the teacher.  And students will have to reach the final of the competition for this.  However, 1C: The club attended the Star Hall Planetarium at the Summer School last year. <br><br>  The author of the article: Ilyin Vladimir Vladimirovich (oivt@ya.ru), teacher, School 179 MIOO of Moscow, teacher of the course ‚ÄúAlgorithms.
