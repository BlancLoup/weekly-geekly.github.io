There was even a video tutorial where the mechanism is described in detail and in detail.  This can be countered. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There are several ways to steal domains, but for the most part they are based on the negligence and forgetfulness of administrators (for example, the mailbox was not used for a long time and it was deleted). <br><br>  Thus, the problem has already been described more than once, the reason why it exists, but no one has suggested a mechanism for dealing with it.  This was a good reason for our team to develop a protective mechanism aimed at protecting the domains of bona fide owners.

      It has been 2 weeks since we watched a video, clearly telling about the method of domain theft (which actually was the impetus to start developing a method of protection) and successfully implemented a mechanism to protect the domains of our clients. <br><br>  Protection is provided free of charge and only on those domains that are located at the registrar of Netfox. <br><br><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><br>  How does the <a href="http://www.netfox.ru/domains/protected/">Domain Name Protection</a> service work at Habrakhabrosud: <br><br>  You can enable the service with just one click of the mouse in the Personal Cabinet of the Netfox Registrar, but to disconnect you will need to make some efforts and this is just the main protection mechanism - you must submit an application to the company's office to disconnect the service, or send a certified application to the notary by mail.  The application must be directly from the domain administrator with copies of the necessary documents. <br><br>  Including the service, you protect the domain from interception and block actions: <br>  - changes to the domain ns servers; <br>  - changes in domain contact information; <br>  - domain administrator changes; <br>  - domain transfer to another registrar. <br><br>  If an unauthorized change of information is attempted to an administrator, a notification is generated by mail. <br><br><h2>  Technical implementation </h2><br>  All partners use the API to access the Registrar's domain name registration system.  Protection is set at 2 levels throughout the system: <br><br>  <b>1. at the API level</b> <br>  Requests to change domain / administrator data are blocked instantly when protection is turned on; a notification to the administrator is generated. <br><br>  <b>2. at the Registrar level</b> <br>  any actions of the Registrar's employees in the system are also monitored by this service - upon any written request from the administrator, our employees will also not be able to make changes if the service is activated.  Only the responsible officer who processes written applications for disabling protection can remove the protection. <br><br>  Information on the included protection for each domain is displayed in the user's Personal Account, if it has a direct contract with the registrar. <br><br>  Partners are gradually drawn to the provision of such a service for their clients - it is enough to add a simple function to call protection and display status on their site. <br><br>  The protection status for all domains is also displayed in the state registrar Whois service: <br>  ... <b>PROTECTED</b> - means that the domain is protected. <br>  ... <b>NOT PROTECTED</b> - means that the domain is not protected by the service. <br><br><h3>  results </h3><br>  From the very first day of introducing the service, it has been used by customers. <br><br>  What is the advantage for organizations: <br>  - the company administrator will not be able to accidentally or intentionally bring down your site (changing the ns-server); <br>  - the administrator will also not be able to change the contact numbers or e-mail domain. <br><br>  And the general advantage for everyone is that if a password is lost, the attacker, having gained access to the Personal Account, cannot do anything with the domain - all operations are simply blocked. <br><br>  Perhaps this service will be popular with other registrars and the Coordination Center together with the Technical Center will make the status global, that is, it will be displayed in the main registry.  But so far in this direction, one registrar of 25 has made a step. <br><br>  More information about the Service can be found at: <br>  <a href="http://www.netfox.ru/domains/protected/">http://www.netfox.ru/domains/protected/</a> <br><br>  We invite all interested domain owners to test the service, it is possible to find flaws and express their opinion in the comments. <br><br>  Of course, the proposed measures are not the solution to all problems.  Therefore, to be continued! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99689/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99689/</a></p>
