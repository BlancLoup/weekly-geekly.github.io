      Now we continue to talk about how our product looks and what it can do.  Since we at RingCloud are developing virtual PBXs, we don‚Äôt feel sorry for donating one so that you can see what is inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/335/839/4c7/3358394c7e0f444580b408570e826640.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We stopped at the review of the anatomy of a virtual PBX RingCloud, having disassembled the interface item "Record conversations".  Now we go further. <br>  Next in the menu is the "Address Book".  This is the "memory" of the service.  It is configured by the administrator.  When adding the next user, you can enter ‚ÄúName‚Äù, ‚ÄúE-mail‚Äù, mobile number, internal number in his data, as well as indicate the company in which he works.  This is convenient if a company that uses a virtual PBX has several branches that have a different name.  You can also share a contact by selecting the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù group in the drop-down menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ab/1ac/93e/4ab1ac93ee6147848cd603f921ddb66f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Any organism, even robotic, cybernetic or digital, needs protection.  In humans, leukocytes carry out protective functions, and in RingCloud service, of course, we already thought about the security of user data, but some of our clients can configure the security settings themselves, which is why we brought this item into the menu.  You can work with security settings in three directions: BLF control, call pickup, and API.  In the BLF management, you can add allowed subscriptions for groups.  In the "call pickup", the pickup setting in groups occurs.  You can add a key to the API and set its permissions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f0/1a3/d0c/1f01a3d0c20640b79086a67eeeb1c838.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the item "Voice Mail" settings are simple, like all brilliant.  This feature can be enabled, or left inactive.  In case you want to receive voice mail.  You only need to specify the e-mail address.  This item is difficult to compare with the body.  But if you compare with a person, then this is like a note that he will read when he wakes up)) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ca/4c9/394/9ca4c93943ff42c39dd776bd61e765b6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The character of RingCloud is a great guy, but he has his own ‚ÄúBlack List‚Äù.  But this is not because our service can be vindictive, but because it protects the nerves and time of those for whom it works.  This item will help you protect yourself from annoying and inappropriate calls.  Unfortunately, there is anything in the work, and there are such instances.  Even just "cold calls" to the company can waste staff time.  In general, an excellent item in the menu, you see.  In any case, it can be useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46d/870/22d/46d87022df074d7db3de1b24e00f3837.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is necessary to feed the person, to fill the car, and service to pay.  Our cloudy PBX is not voracious at all, but for a normal young body to work, it must be paid monthly.  It is like a digestive system.  And, by the way, there are also detailed statistics and cost details.  You can always see how much money the service has ‚Äúconsumed‚Äù.  If you understand that your business is growing, and it lacks the minimum tariff, change it to one that is more powerful.  ‚ÄúFeed‚Äù means, i.e.  make payment, you can also here.  These are all sub-clauses of the ‚ÄúPayment‚Äù section.  Payment history, documents and details.  Everything that the user wants depends on the service to run smoothly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/451/49b/93a/45149b93adfe4647b4f60254cea7ad09.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When our service was just born, we did not show it to anyone.  He grew up before our eyes, until he became a full-fledged performer of the goals for which we created it.  Now, everyone who uses it fills in the ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù.  This is how your virtual PBX will be called, as well as the data of the one who takes our assistant and promises to pay bills.  Therefore, the contact details and payment details of the user are entered here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a3/a86/426/1a3a86426b6d4f929aa4c59c6533fc78.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now in the development of another item for your convenience is the "Assistant" to which the user can contact the question directly, without leaving your personal account and not even dialing the number.  So, it's simple, at hand. <br><br>  What do you think?  We are waiting for your comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261247/</a></p>
