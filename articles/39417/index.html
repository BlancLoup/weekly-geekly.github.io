The third part will probably be released closer to the end of September, after three more exams. <br><br>  So, having considered various options for immigration to Germany in the previous article, this time we‚Äôll dwell on educational immigration in more detail, even if it is short-term, in order to ‚Äúsee the world and show ourselves‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So, different types of immigration to Germany can be divided into the following categories: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">  Types of immigration to Germany for the purpose of studying: </td></tr><tr><td>  Short-term (up to 1 year) </td><td>  Long-term (over 1 year) </td></tr><tr><td><ol><li>  According to the exchange program of your university. </li><li>  According to the international exchange program. </li><li>  At the short invitation of the German university or professor. </li></ol><br></td><td><ol><li>  For internship or practice. </li><li>  For education in Germany. </li><li>  For the passage of graduate school in Germany (PhD). </li></ol><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Let's consider these options in a little more detail. <br><h5>  Short-term visits for study and advanced training </h5><br>  In general, short-term visits are the most optimal way, at least for a start, to plunge into the local environment in order for yourself to understand what you want and what you are ready to do for it.  The best, in my opinion, is staying in Germany for one academic semester - in this way you can quite a lot see, understand, try it yourself, but on the other hand - there is not yet a sufficiently strong ‚Äúbinding‚Äù and, if desired, there is no desire to continue further) - then you can give up and start looking for yourself in another direction, or at worst in another country :) <br><br><h6>  Exchange within the limits of the high school. </h6><br>  Probably this is one of the best options in terms of travel and language, and is most suitable for those who do not want to go through the whole process of obtaining a study visa. <br><br>  In my university, unfortunately, programs of this kind were the prerogative of "their own circle" (especially for which the university paid for), and self-financing, often, is very heavy for an ordinary student.  Nevertheless, if the opportunity of this kind is given to you, it is better not to miss it - all other methods require much more work and effort, and the probability of success is less! <br><br><h6>  Exchange within the international program. </h6><br>  There are a large number of international and German funds whose purpose is to sponsor an ‚Äúacademic exchange‚Äù (this means not the exchange of academics, and Akademiker - university students), while they usually pay all the costs associated with traveling, organizing, receiving visas, and often have already developed infrastructure "on the spot" - that is, shelter or a guest house, a developed program and experience in conducting such exchanges. <br><br>  At the same time, I would like to note that these programs are often aimed at students in countries where the student usually cannot pay for such a trip on his own - so many funds work with Russia.  And, frankly, an average Russian student can get something from the German government and foundations much easier than a successful German student. <br><br>  There are hundreds of such funds, I saw a list in my field (neuroscience), where there were more than 200 - and many of them offer such exchanges.  The most famous foundations are DAAD, Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung, Leopoldina, Konrad-Adenauer Stiftung, Stiftung der Abgeordneten in Berlin and so on. <br><br>  For those who plan to visit Germany in this way, the following important points should be kept in mind: <br><ol><li>  Most of the funds have websites on the Internet, where you can download and fill in all the necessary documents yourself - and send them directly to Germany.  Only the largest (for example, DAAD) have separate offices in Russia - but from this here and more competition.  Sending documents directly to Germany in a small fund you are much more likely to get a positive response! </li><li>  Most of the funds have a ‚Äúfinished cycle‚Äù and consider applications 1-2-4 times a year, so you should hurry in advance with the documents and the application. </li><li>  There are paid publications that publish the addresses of funds with detailed data.  Usually such a publication helps a lot to determine the list of funds and necessary documents, and it is worth buying it, although in theory all the information is on the Internet - you just need to be able to search and (often) understand German. </li></ol><br><br><h6>  The invitation of the university or professor. </h6><br>  If you intend to do a graduate school in Germany, then I would strongly recommend that you first ‚Äúask for‚Äù a short (say, a month and a half) visit to the professor you want to do graduate school with.  Usually, funds for ‚Äútravel of invited persons‚Äù are the most difficult part of the budget, which must be closed, and professors easily invite students and graduate students to work-see from abroad.  This kind of arrival, however, does not oblige anyone to anything.  In general, it‚Äôs probably not quite right to single out such a visit as a separate item - I just wanted to point out that this is a reliable and easy way to get acquainted with the local educational system. <br><br><h5>  Long-term (a year or more) immigration for the purpose of study. </h5><br>  Moving to Germany for the purpose of studying for a long time is necessary only if the goal is clearly formulated and accepted and all possible (positive and negative) consequences of this step are assessed. <br><br>  On the one hand, one needs to be well aware that in terms of studying in Germany, as well as throughout Europe, a ‚Äústudent model‚Äù is adopted - that is, no one will ever motivate a student to learn something, no one will be engaged further or somehow help in studies: you can safely not study for three or four semesters without any negative consequences, and when you are excluded because of the exam that was passed for the third time in a few days, no one will remember you.  For many, therefore, studying in Germany turns out to be quite a difficult process, proceeding according to the principle ‚ÄúI will not explain anything, but then I will ask at the exam!‚Äù.  In fact, opportunities to get knowledge of the sea, you just need to actively do it all the time, and not just in the session for 3-4 days before the next exam. <br><br>  On the other hand, when starting (or continuing) studies in Germany, it is worth bearing in mind that work, career growth and gained experience are being postponed for the period of study.  Well, of course, to study up to 30, and up to 35 - there are many such students in Germany and, in principle, there is no problem with the fact that you stand out from the whole stream, but during the time you once again sat at a desk and something there At the lecture, your friends have already become heads and are working in positions to which you, a beginning career in your ‚Äúlate 20‚Äù or ‚Äúearly 30‚Äù, are still 5-6-8 years old.  Is it worth it - you need to decide in each case. <br><br><h6>  Internship and practice. </h6><br>  The same funds that willingly pay for ‚Äúacademic exchange‚Äù often offer programs and longer stays, usually up to 1 year, for internships or internships.  This usually involves a more or less scientific internship, that is, you need to find a professor (sometimes even 2) who will agree to supervise you on the spot.  But in reality you can find someone from the industry, and other options. <br><br>  This is a very cheap and profitable option of a trip to find work: during the internship period, funding comes from the foundation, and the employer (or someone associated with it) gets the opportunity to test an interesting candidate for free.  Plus, in the case of an internship, it is much easier to obtain a work permit, which is very difficult to obtain from scratch in Germany. <br><br>  Usually, during the internship period, the ‚Äúinterns‚Äù are enrolled in the university as undergraduate or graduate students, so you can easily attend classes and lectures that interest you.  Only examinations, as a rule, cannot be taken in such status. <br><br>  Another spoonful of tar is that a visa and a residence permit obtained for such a trip cannot be exchanged for a visa in Germany for work and you need to travel and start everything from the beginning in Russia.  But with personal contact, this process can speed up significantly. <br><br>  Such programs are offered by most of the funds known to me, DAAD, Leopoldina and others, just enough to get acquainted with the catalog of scholarships offered. <br><br><h6>  Obtaining (additional) education. </h6><br>  First of all, you should immediately understand that financing your training is exclusively your personal matter.  The state of Germany and its foundations are completely uninteresting to pay for your education, so finding a scholarship to study in Germany is practically unrealistic, as unrealistic as it is to find a job for Germany, and support yourself.  Forget about all the funds: if you are going to go here for student status, then until you graduate from university and become a graduate student or research assistant, not one foundation that has received you so willingly and cordially will look in your direction. <br><br>  The formal requirements for candidates who wish to obtain a university education in Germany are ‚Äúthe presence of a foreign certificate of education, equal in strength to a German school certificate (student)‚Äù. <br>  Due to the fact that school education in Germany lasts 13 years, in order to successfully receive such confirmation of the ‚Äúequivalence‚Äù of secondary education in Germany, it is necessary for Russians to prove that they have a school certificate and 4 semesters (2 years) full-time (and 3 - extramural) studies at the university.  Moreover, in the case of only these 2 courses (that is, in the case of incomplete higher education), only the so-called ‚Äúprofessional enrollment‚Äù (fachgebundenes Abitur) will be recognized, that is, it will be possible to continue education at a university in Germany only in its specialty (or one step from it). <br><br>  A diploma of a Russian university is recognized as a sufficient education in order to confirm ‚Äúa general enrollment, that is, you are given the opportunity to study any subject of your choice (for example, with a diploma of a pediatrician I study as an electronic engineer).  I have not yet come across any recognition of a Russian bachelor, but in Germany there are already internal problems about bachelor recognition between universities, so I would rather be pessimistic. <br><br>  The second formal requirement for learning is sufficient language comprehension.  In the case of a bachelor's degree, such a language still remains German, and a sufficient level of knowledge is passed by the DAF or DSH exams, then more and more often English and English are required for master studies and, accordingly, TOEFL, IELTS or similar.  In principle, in my opinion, a rather low level is required, but since German education is not so well-delivered in Russia and not so many materials in this field, and also because of the specificity of the language itself, many consider these German language exams to be much more complicated than English. <br><br>  To obtain a residence permit (which must be obtained within 90 days while the entry visa is valid) and extending it for a year it is required to prove the availability of funds in the amount of 7,200 Euros per year, in a number of lands this amount and necessary evidence (blocked account, etc.) may slightly differ).  "Student" residence permit gives the right to work for 90 days (8 hours a day), or 180 half hours (4 hours), which is enough to support yourself as a student.  Work at the University, often, can not be counted at this time, increasing the total amount of time allowed to work! <br><br>  Applicants to a university to start their studies ‚Äúfrom the very beginning‚Äù should bear in mind a number of important points: <br><ol><li>  Theoretically, there is a possibility to ‚Äúrecount‚Äù a number of subjects, but usually this happens ‚Äúsemi-automatically‚Äù: some (very small set) of subjects are automatically counted (Anerkennung), while others need to be ‚Äúcounted‚Äù (Anrechnen) for each of the professors separately, while Professors often organize a small exam on the subject, and also ask for a detailed curriculum with a clock on each topic, which can be quite difficult to translate, and it is easier to ‚Äúsit out‚Äù the subject. </li><li>  Since a visa and a residence permit for students are tied to their studies, it is quite possible that the ABH (foreigners ‚Äôagency) will be interested in studying.  In any case, change of university is possible only during the first six months.  Change the direction of training and specialization can, as a rule, only once, then the problems begin with the extension of a residence permit.  And yet: a residence permit for the purpose of studying is strictly limited to 10 years, then it can no longer be renewed! </li><li>  Now in Germany, the structure of the ‚Äúcentral inspection of foreign certificate of education‚Äù called Uni-Assist is growing.  I can only evaluate her work very negatively: often the requirements for certifying documents are either sucked from the finger, or simply contradict the laws of Germany (for example, the notary has no right to certify a copy of a document in a foreign language, even if he makes a copy!) documents require money, and considerable (50 Euro).  More and more universities, alas, are beginning to cooperate with her, in connection with which getting a residence permit for study becomes even more difficult ... </li></ol><br><br><h6>  Graduate School. </h6><br>  Many for some reason believe that graduate school abroad, particularly in Germany, is the prerogative of the "most-most".  In fact, this is not the case.  Of all the options for possible immigration studies in Germany, it is the easiest and most reliable.  However, before you commit yourself, you should understand the following: <br><br><ol><li>  A German student, having graduated from a university and having received a diploma, begins to work with a starting salary of about 30-40 thousand Euros per year.  Graduate students receive about 20-25 thousand euros per year. </li><li>  Many funds willingly pay for the position of graduate students, if they are occupied by foreigners.  Therefore, your professor probably received such a position for free for himself and his university, and is only pleased with the additional labor force! </li><li>  No one expects a graduate student to open a new or linear-time method for solving an NP problem today or tomorrow.  A graduate student is usually taken to work on an already more or less developed topic for 2‚Äì3 years, working out his dissertation.  And nothing beyond this is expected of you, teach !!! </li></ol><br><br>  Therefore, graduate school is not a ‚ÄúVIP-option‚Äù for talented graduate students, such positions are better suited to middle peasants that they are accustomed to work and are willing to work for another 3-4 years hard, for the sake of European PI-di.  For those who are looking for some kind of challege, it is better to quickly go through graduate school at home, defend oneself, and then look for a place for yourself as a techie scientist. <br><br>  Unlike other options, graduate school, however, has a number of advantages: <br><ol><li>  You are paid from the very beginning about 1000-1200 Euro per month.  This is enough to not only live without problems, but even in most cases for reunion with the wife and child. </li><li>  To issue a visa and obtain a residence permit, a labor market audit is not required, as in the case of "working" visas and a residence permit. </li><li>  The time spent on this residence permit can be counted at best completely, and at worst - as half, for obtaining permanent residence and citizenship. </li><li>  In case of success in science there is an opportunity to apply for permanent residence as a ‚Äúhighly qualified specialist‚Äù </li><li>  You are engaged in work in your specialty, or at least, according to what you studied at the university. </li><li>  You start in Germany immediately with a fairly high status "graduate student".  In Germany, people have traditionally been very respectful of people who have reached such a high level in education, given that here half of the students do not complete school at all, and half of those who do not go to university.  This is especially felt when you later ‚Äúslip down‚Äù to a simple student. </li></ol><br>  Her only drawback, in general, is probably worth only considering her time and possible ‚Äúdelaying‚Äù of work with time. <br><br>  Since in Germany there are really problems with filling in postgraduate studies, as a rule, recognition of a diploma for admission to graduate school passes quickly, and many ‚Äúconclusions‚Äù (as, for example, in mine) are separately emphasized: the specialty is not an obstacle to the graduate school on the basis of this diploma. " <br><br>  The situation with postgraduate education is about the same in all countries, so you can take into account the above for other EU countries. <br><br><h5>  Instead of a conclusion ... </h5><br>  To plan educational immigration to Germany, you need to have a clearly set goal with a detailed timeframe and a fountain of self-motivation.  Only in this case, you can count on a positive result. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39417/</a></p>
