It is rather a sensation.  Atmospheres are strong and weak, benevolent, hostile, dreary, etc.  This is something like an internal mood and the state of several people.  The more people in the same atmosphere, the stronger it is.  A vivid example: a funeral.  Everyone is in a state of depression and sadness, even if they do not really want it!

      There are several important points: <br>  1. Atmosphere can be created alone <br>  2. Atmosphere can be "broken" <br>  3. Destructive atmospheres tend to self-reinforce (for example, an aggressive crowd) <br><br>  And now, for the sake of what I began to write it at all: a person is comfortable (it is easier to work, it is better to rest) when he gets into the atmosphere consonant with him.  But the good news is that the atmosphere can be created by yourself, which will be good :) <br><br>  Let us examine a few examples. <br><br>  <b>GAI officer.</b>  <b>(My favorite example.)</b> <br>  Situation one: a traffic police officer is slowing you down.  Your emotions?  If you hurry often the thought ‚ÄúWhat a fig!  I'm nothing ... ‚Äù, it develops into irritation, which is difficult to hide and it is felt by the GAI officer.  Now put yourself in his place: would you be pleased if you were at work for anything for you to be watered with emotional mud (I consider irritation to be just such a substance)? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  How can you?  It is enough not to save this substance.  Set initial confidence and gentle impulse.  Just do not bring it to the point of absurdity and fawn (it looks disgusting: remember some kind of films where the rubbed driver drove diminishedly, and having driven off proudly curses the GAI officer).  Enough to get out of the car (yes, I know that you can not leave, which is why if you go out and warm up at the same time, this is a step towards), smile a little and wish a good time of day.  If you have never tried it, I highly recommend it! <br><br>  Situation two: you violated, you were stopped (offered to watch a video, photo, showed a radar, etc.).  As a rule, people do not like to plead guilty and therefore ... begin to defend themselves by attacking.  Those.  right from the threshold begin to "bull".  I think that GAI officers more than once a day encounter such behavior, it is understandable and familiar to them, but that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs equally unpleasant.  They just learned to beat back.  Still, power structures clothed with power :) Most of the scary stories about terrible GAI officers who throw out documents and arrest for nothing about anything have something unsaid: it all started with simple aggression ... Well, it developed into something they like to savor <br><br>  But what about?  Yes, very simple!  You broke?  And if violated, can it be worth recognizing?  Everyone breaks, someone unknowingly, someone accidentally, but that's all.  And now because of this, cut the veins?  Admittedly.  In front of.  (Acknowledging that one is wrong in general drastically reduces the intensity of passions) And then, recognizing oneself, it is much easier to recognize it before a traffic cop.  No need to wallow in the dirt and humiliated humiliated.  God forbid!  You can even smile - you did not kill, just violated the speed.  It is just money.  Create your own atmosphere, a little relaxing, trusting, they say, yes, I know, I thought, I will try to be more attentive.  I am ready to incur punishment, I do not unlock it, but please understand it humanly.  Not only is this behavior purely psychologically less stressful, it is also possible to save money. <br><br>  Disclaimer: I do not condone the violation, but if it has already happened, do not suicide. <br><br>  <b>Job.</b> <br>  Are you comfortable in the workplace?  Do you like to go there?  Most likely you will answer that more likely yes than not, but there are a number of points: the accountant will bore how he starts to cut - you can‚Äôt stop, the boss - he curses more than he needs, his colleagues are not perfect either ... <br><br>  And what can be done?  Most often, the discomfort from the fact that you fall into the unusual and unpleasant atmosphere created by others.  You consider them stronger and try to adjust, you experience discomfort and this is the result ... But you can come to work and try to create the atmosphere that you like there!  With such a clearly expressed position (for example, you are always joyful, energetic, joking) you will be approached by people in tune with you, with whom you will be comfortable.  And if a man comes with his own atmosphere, you have your own.  And yet it is not known whose victory, if you yourself do not give up the position. <br><br>  <b>The most difficult: parents.</b> <br>  Very often, we still remain children in front of our parents.  There is a long-standing atmosphere with them, in which you are an annoying factor, and not an adult.  And they very easily ‚Äúpierce‚Äù us with their moralizing, discontent ... We habitually accept their atmosphere, pressure ... We very quickly start ‚Äúold yeast‚Äù. <br><br>  It is very difficult, but you can somehow reverse it.  Enough of them ... sorry!  After all, they love us, want to help, just do it in a completely different way, as we would like.  Often instead of sympathy - notation, instead of praise - criticism, they say it could be better.  But you can take on the active position of the "creator of the atmosphere" - ask about their condition, take pity, praise, like a child.  The main thing is to set your own, comfortable atmosphere.  Immediately I warn you: it is very difficult, you need to do a lot of work ... <br><br>  Now a couple of exercises: come to work with a smile.  That is right with her, natural, you can full-mouth.  Let everyone see that you are positive today.  It will charge you and others.  You can help yourself: bring some nishtyaki / cakes, treat everyone with lunch, in general, make a nice thread and out of the ordinary.  At first, it seems hard, but why me?  But you do it for yourself. <br><br>  Try to keep your peace of mind at a meeting held on high voices, not to lose confidence.  Knowing that there will be such an event, you can prepare: you can sing a song, remember the smile and the joy of meeting with the child.  In general, to find the point of support that will allow not so much to cling to the current situation. <br><br>  I wish you all who want to try, good luck on this path.  It is not simple, but allows you to be what you yourself want.  As Makarevich sings, ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt cave in to a changing world, let it be better to bend under us.‚Äù  I agree with him, because each of us strive to be himself! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88892/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88892/</a></p>
