Of course, yesterday's announcement of Steve Jobs about leaving for the hospital was not accidental, and it was he who made the announcement of new records, and not vice versa.  The question about the head of the company certainly hung in everyone‚Äôs heads, but during the question and answer session this question was asked of course, and the name of Steve was mentioned essentially only once. <br><br>  As for reporting, Apple continued to record the entire industry (see my previous articles on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/106330/">Google</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/microsoft/107143/">Microsoft</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/adobe/110480/">Adobe</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/106408/">Apple</a> itself, Intel showed record numbers this week in history), showing absolutely the best quarter.  Record was almost everything - total revenue, net profit, sales of Mac, iPhone, iPad.  Profit for the first quarter - <strong>$ 26.7 billion</strong> , a growth of <strong>71%</strong> per year, net profit - <strong>$ 6 billion</strong> .  Let me remind you, the last quarter includes all Christmas sales.

      The main actor on the call with analysts was the current head of the company and COO Tim Cook, he answered all questions. <br><br>  The situation in the product segments is as follows: <a name="habracut"></a><ol><li>  Mac <br><br>  <strong>Record</strong>  Sales of Apple computers grew by 23% to 4.1 million units over the year.  IDC estimates that the growth of the personal computer market is 3%, Apple grew 8 times faster than the market. <br><br>  Separately, the role of Japan and the Pacific region was noted, where growth exceeded 50%. <br><br>  Opened in January, the Mac App Store is available in 90 countries, includes more than 1,000 paid and free applications and provided more than 1 million downloads on the first day after launch. <br></li><li>  iPod and iTunes <br><br>  Sales of iPods amounted to 19.4 million units, an increase of 27% over the year.  Already half of all new players is iPod Touch. <br><br>  iPod continues to occupy more than 70% of the market of mp3-players (according to MPD) and is the best-selling player in most countries of the world. <br><br>  iTunes brought the company $ 1.1 billion, users buy and rent more than 400,000 TV episodes and 150,000 films a year. <br><br></li><li>  iphone <br><br>  <strong>Record</strong>  Sales of iPhones grew by as much as 86% over the year to 16.2 million units.  According to IDC, the growth of the smartphone market is 70%, Apple is also faster than the market. <br><br>  For the money - it is more than $ 10 billion, profit growth, along with accessories - 88%.  Today, iPhone is available in 90 countries with 185 mobile operators. <br><br>  In February, iPhone 4 will be available to Verizon users, of which more than 93 million today. <br><br>  The performance in Japan and the Pacific has more than doubled. <br><br>  It was noted that the iPhone continues to develop in the business sector, it includes the equipment used. <br><br>  Currently, 88 of the Fortune 100 (100 most profitable American companies) and 60% of FT 1000 (1000 European companies) are testing it or are already deploying it. <br><br>  Among them - Starbucks, Danone, Nissan, Wells Fargo, DuPont, Staples. <br><br></li><li>  iPad <br><br>  <strong>Record</strong> (for its history, a year ago it was not yet).  7.3 million units sold in 47 countries, revenue - $ 4.61 billion <br><br>  Also of great interest in the business sector - 80 companies from Fortune 100 plan to include or have already included in the supported equipment, including JPMorgan Chase, Dupont, Wells Fargo. <br>  The company has significantly increased the production of tablets to meet demand. <br><br>  In total, 160 million iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) were sold with access to more than 300,000 applications, 9 billion total downloads. <br><br></li><li>  Apple Store Shops <br><br>  Revenue rose 95% to $ 3.5 billion. <br><br>  Half of those who bought Mac computers over the past six months have never used it. <br><br>  A total of 323 stores opened, 6 in the last quarter, a total of 87 stores not in the United States.  The best indicators on sales and customer flow in the world are from China. </li></ol>  At the moment, Apple has a record amount of cash - <strong>$ 59 billion</strong> . <br><br>  Traditionally, a lot of interesting things have been said in the question and answer session.  Last time, it was there that Steve Jobs told everything he <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/106408/">thinks</a> about Android-based tablets. <br><br>  This time there was also a question about the competition with the iPad.  Cook replied that now it is in fact not present - Windows-based devices are too big, heavy, expensive and with a bad battery, they require a keyboard or a stylus.  Based on Android - Google itself says that the current OS version is not suitable for tablets, the size is not suitable for full-fledged work.  They look like enlarged smartphones and are a ‚Äúfancy product‚Äù (bizarre).  This is what is on sale today. <br><br>  What will happen next - we'll see, but Apple also does not sit still. <br><br>  Another question about the iPad - is there a ‚Äúcannibalization‚Äù of the Mac from the side of the tablet?  Cook replied that he did not know, but admits that there is.  That some users buy tablets instead of computers.  But since Apple‚Äôs share in the PC market is not very large, it beats not only on them.  He also believes that there is a ‚Äúhalo effect‚Äù - a person with an iPad is likely to buy other Apple products.  So it was with the iPhone after the success of the iPad. <br><br>  Will there be a merger of iPad and Mac branches?  So far there are no such plans, but these groups in the company have a common DNA and do one thing.  Here, Cook just refers to Jobs - if Macs and iPads were made by different companies, then the last MacBook Air would be the answer to the Macs. <br><br>  Many questions about the balance of supply and demand.  Apple does not have time to produce as many devices as they are ready to buy.  And while they do not expect to be able to achieve this balance for the iPhone.  For the iPad, it has been achieved, significant investments in production have been made, sales have increased from 15 to 60 countries lately. <br><br>  International development - as seen above, Asia is growing steadily and quickly.  Among the BRIC countries (which includes Russia), Apple has long chosen the Chinese market as a priority.  The result is $ 2.6 billion in revenue for the Greater China Region (China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan together).  Korea also shows rapid growth. <br><br>  Traditionally, Apple has not disclosed any plans for the future, so that competitors do not use for their own purposes.  Cook said Apple‚Äôs strategy is ‚Äúmagic‚Äù that allows you to make better products.  Nevertheless, there is room to grow - the share of the personal computer market is still not very large, and the smartphone market is extremely competitive with a large number of players. <br><br>  In general, such a positive report, though predicted, but its scale has updated all records.  This greatly helped the <a href="http://www.bing.com/finance/search%3Fq%3DAAPL%26amp%3BFORM%3DDTPFSA%26amp%3Bqpvt%3DAAPL">shares of the</a> company, which since the morning on the background of news about Jobs's disease plummeted. <br><br>  Now everyone is waiting for news from friends-competitors - Google announces the numbers already this week, Microsoft - the next. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112125/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112125/</a></p>
