Just for fun, no sales are planned, but if you get a big book, we will be happy if many people read it. <br><br>  In the book, we try to explore how technology development can affect consciousness, personality and lifestyle.  And of course, there is no escape from the war against the System, love, the invention of new gadgets and other cyberpunk attributes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d02/fbf/065/d02fbf0651574bcc9dfd4fda7c009cca.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The spirit of the warrior in the era of globalization, AI and the Internet of Things is dedicated.

      Alex had been preparing for this moment for three years, and now it has arrived.  A store of a famous brand, you need to take exactly 10 minutes to choose a shirt, buy a red shirt.  The reaction of the System will follow in four minutes: a coordinator will appear and ask why he bought a red shirt. <br>  Inside, everything froze, as before jumping on a snowboard from a springboard.  A familiar feeling, but instead of half an hour he had been preparing for this moment for three years. <br><br>  Smiling nice girl in the hall and swarming in shirts.  Ten minutes have passed, we take the red one, with a voice we confirm the choice and the exit.  Agent Smith should appear next to the Munbaks coffee house, as the coordinators Alex called with irony, quoting the favorite retro film The Matrix. <br>  And here he is, sleek boy.  Unlike agent Smith, the film looks just like a girl, in her hands is a tablet-questionnaire, he is more likely to give status, since the infa is output to the virtual interface of the retina and is also automatically written by him.  "Sorry, can I ask you to answer a few questions to improve the work of the mall?" <br>  Alex was shaken up from the subcostal space, there was a desire to respond statistically correct nonsense about the fact that he was depressed and tired of grayness, this would explain the fact of shopping in the mall and a non-standard choice, but repeating the mantra ‚ÄúWarrior is already dead and he has nothing to lose ‚ÄùAnd smiled tightly, replied:‚Äú Of course! ‚Äù, And with a sweep of his head hit the consultant in the face. <br><br>  *** <br>  Three years before the events described, Faculty of Applied Mathematics of the North-West agglomerate. <br><br>  Do you have your thoughts !?  - yelling Alex in the face drunk Uriy.  ‚ÄúYou can't know that.‚Äù  What we think is a product of influence from the outside, and only thoughts that have no artificial causes can be considered "ours", and such things are not born in us.  Even if they arise, we deafen them - we run to work, relax or drink.  Because such thoughts are uncomfortable, they do not belong to a suit. ‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúCostumes‚Äù Urius called himself and everyone around, implying that the person is like rags put on us against his will (mathematicians hate costumes just like financiers are dirty jeans of mathematicians). <br>  - This era has devoured individuality and produced us!  - he continued.  - Look at me, my desires and reactions.  There is no one here except for two programs! <br><br>  The booze with Uriy was purely masculine, since the girls and Uriy did not match each other, but Alex's search for freedom attracted a hysterical search for freedom. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Alex said.  - Let's be constructive at least once.  We are mathematicians, and if we are to become virtual chewers of the 21st century, we must first work out the concept and methods of dealing with the System. <br><br>  Urius suddenly calmed down. <br><br>  - Ok, pour me more this stuff, and let's start. <br>  They drank the cheapest chacha from the Sochi agglomerate, which the locals traditionally drove there.  There was nothing natural in the cup, but a friend Shurik regularly supplied it with various pickles.  Shurik himself rarely participated in booze, as he had quite wealthy parents and he loved to talk to girls.  Therefore, he preferred to drink in women's companies - in cafes or straight from the girls. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLet's start with what's clear even to you,‚Äù said Uriy after another dose of chacha.  He had the right to such replicas, since IQ Uriah was 152, and Alex 124. - I repeat once again, for the ‚Äúgifted‚Äù.  Do you think you want and drink this tea because you chose to eat and drink, or because the system decided so? <br><br>  Here it is, the old paranoia, Alex thought.  The system, as Urius called the invisible control of the world by the highest artificial intelligence.  Development vector and other crap.  All this had gotten Alex for a long time, but at the same time attracted, like an old cupboard, in which I searched a hundred times, but every time you hope to dig out some kind of grandmother's secret. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOf course, this is what I want, not the System,‚Äù Alex answered.  - I cannot even supposedly imagine such a System, which controls absolutely everything, decisive for me at this level.  I feel the urge to drink chacha, and then I drink.  This is absurd. <br><br>  - Yeah!  Exclaimed the excited Uriah.  - Well, no.  Imagine the possibilities of the System regarding you.  She knows about your every move.  Incoming and outgoing information via electronic channels is recorded.  She has information about the weather around you, the environment, people.  Knows about your interests.  It records the sounds, colors, auras and histories of each object of your environment in every second of its existence, it records the data of your body - pulse, temperature, brain activity. <br>  Like you, 11 billion.  The data is saved thanks to IT (in 2038, all inhabitants of the earth began to implant an information terminal chip with a camera, gps, telemetry, etc., for better health care and combating global terrorism). <br>  Imagine this universe of infinite data, for the processing of which the unified government is constantly building new modules in Antarctic City and Luna City.  Antarctica has become a large data center, and Luna City has become its backup system. <br>  You are nothing more than a bit of data in a large program that imagines that it can drink chacha at will. <br><br>  It sounded reasonable to an alcohol-weakened mind, but Alex said: <br><br>  - These are common words.  Explain specifically how to make me want to drink chacha with you, instead of going to light with the girls? <br>  Yes, stupid and easy!  - excited Uriy.  - Your flow of thoughts is linear and depends on many factors. <br>  You are a complete moron!  He suddenly shouted. <br>  What?  - Alex is offended.  - This is too much, you go crazy! <br>  Offended?  - urij uriy.  - See the causal relationship?  And if this connection is over 1000 steps, are there more than a million similar connections and they depend on other ‚Äúcostumes‚Äù in the System?  Will you track? <br><br>  Alex said nothing. <br><br>  Come on.  First, look at what parameters the system controls officially, ‚Äùsaid Urius.  We know them, but still look. <br><br>  Alex's voice activated the holographic interface ‚ÄúSystem asset‚Äù, built into the retina: ‚ÄúShow me the parameters of my monitoring‚Äù. <br>  The usual window appeared, decorated in silver-black tones - Alex liked these two colors most of all, and he always set up the interfaces in this range. <br>  The list was divided into groups: <br><ul><li>  physical parameters </li><li>  brain activity </li><li>  monitoring in space </li><li>  monitoring the external environment </li><li>  monitoring sound communications, </li><li>  monitoring of computer communications, </li><li>  monitoring of visual communications. </li></ul><br>  Now imagine that such a monitoring exists on all beings and things, without exception, on machines and objects with which we interact, including a shower, toilet, light bulbs and everything else, ‚ÄùUriy continued.  - And how do we track the impact of the system? <br><br>  Hmm, I guess.  this is impossible, ‚Äùsaid Alex,‚Äú but this is a speculative conclusion, not confirmed by anything.  I propose to go to practice. <br><br>  Come on, ‚Äùsaid Urius.  - I have been thinking about this for a long time.  This theory cannot be verified by tracking the causes, since the human mind is able to process much less information than the system‚Äôs mind, and we do not have the capacities it has.  The system compared to us is like God with a capital letter.  In addition, the management process is likely self-regulating.  That is, it is not controlled completely, but statistically directed. <br>  Imagine that we are investigating the behavior of ants in an anthill.  They act strictly within certain rules.  An anthill is the same System.  And if the ant does something not on the program, it will be immediately noticed and will cause a System reaction. <br>  So we will find out if the System controls us.  We need to do several things that go beyond the usual, and observe what will happen in our life.  The system will manifest itself!  If this happens, then we are governed.  If not, you can continue to drink chacha and savor the meaninglessness of existence.  No fight - no fun! <br><br>  ‚ÄúOk,‚Äù said Alex.  - I propose to write down the findings, so as not to forget.  I have to go to sleep.  Tomorrow we will begin to sober. <br><br>  The usual gray morning was filled with a special dry mouth with a taste of chacha.  Alex was splashing in the shower until the water turned off.  ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúagain, because of the hangover, half the daily norm has been chosen, and all this foolish fear of neurocorrettors.  It would be possible to remove the hangover by mental effort. ‚Äù  However, here he was in complete agreement with Urii: if you get used to this, it would not be long to become an automatic appendage to the surrounding techno-world.  So while Alex did not put these implants.  Fortunately, they were still sewn at will - unlike IT, which they had been implanted with since childhood. <br><br>  Going down to the cafe, through the holointerface, Alex ordered a personal set number three for breakfast.  He liked coffee with cardamom and cinnamon, and slightly overcooked eggs.  In the edals, we had long been prepared automatically, and it was possible to invent our own sets, which were immediately made from the basic ingredients.  Food carried drones.  The embedded IT chip received the request, issued the location, and the drone brought the order to the place where the client was sitting.  Payment is automatically debited from a single account. <br><br>  Only in the most expensive restaurants where Alex had never been, they continued to cook by hand, and the dishes were served by real people. <br><br>  At the far table sat Urius, as usual, studying something in virtuality.  It was immediately obvious when a person uses the built-in virtual interface: posture, gestures and motor skills slightly changed.  The man whose interface was 100% activated, stood out even stronger.  Small information windows for most people ‚Äúhung‚Äù constantly.  Reminders, motivators, movement assistants, food ordering and things ordering systems, activity monitoring ... A small window with widgets was constantly dangling from the right side. <br>  Alex thought that if it were not for the ban on delivering food to the place of residence, Uriy would not get off the bed at all.  Perhaps it was the main reason for the ban - to make people move a little in space and communicate. <br><br>  Alex hooked to Uriah and activated the chat.  Wrote: ‚ÄúUriah, wake up, the raccoon has come!‚Äù.  Uriy disconnected and looked absently at Alex. <br>  And ... hearty, - he croaked.  ‚ÄúPoor intellectuals are suffering, but you are all hihans.‚Äù <br>  Such is the fate of intellectuals, - Alex smiled, - it has been known since antiquity.  Many knowledge - many sorrows, so bring your cross, older! <br><br>  Urius grimaced, sipped his coffee and said: <br><br>  While someone is dead, I thought of everything.  Since we do not have enough data, we just need to start acting. <br><br>  <i>Further in the book:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Fighting friends decided that they would start behaving in a non-standard way and keeping track of what was going on around them.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>After several experiments, Urius goes to the hospital for a psycho correction.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Friends decide that evidence is obtained.</i>  <i>The next step is to break the system.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>First, you need to reprogram the built-in sensors so that you can manage outgoing information.</i>  <i>However, the equipment is only in the center of the correction.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Develop a plan.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And here is Alex in the store.</i> <br><br><h2>  Catechism of the Warrior of Virtuality (VV) </h2><br><br>  Catechism of explosives appeared in the era of formation.  This is the code of the fighters with the System.  Initially, it was freely distributed and supplemented by BB in Wikipedia.  However, after attributing the BB philosophy to terrorism, the catechism was banned, and it was stored in encrypted form in a distributed network. <br><br>  1. BB is a warrior of the virtual space that challenges the System for the sake of freeing all creatures that have fallen into it. <br>  2. BB is always aware that he is just a signal, and that everything around is also just signals, and therefore he does not cling to anything and act with maximum efficiency. <br>  3. The effectiveness of actions is not the goal; it is a consequence of non-attachment to one‚Äôs image and external manifestations of the environment. <br>  4. BB constantly reminds himself that all his thoughts, states, everything he sees or feels are like a dream.  This is the basis of the practice of non-attachment. <br><br><h2>  Also created </h2><br>  1. Poetry of virtuality. <br>  2. Methods of self-development of explosives. <br><br>  If you have read this place and you are interested in continuing, you can let us know in the comments or with a plus sign. <br>  Any ideas are also interesting! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377419/</a></p>
