      Millions of years of evolution gave us unique communication skills, rich language and emotions. <br><br>  We are confident that the evolution of smartphones is moving along the same principle: only those devices that can be most adapted to the communication mutations of our society will not die out and will receive their further development. <br><br>  As part of the Idea Camp, we have tried to grope the directions of this development, which will enable the next generation of our smartphones to expand the communicative (and not only) abilities of their owners. <br>  How it passed, read under a cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab1/c1b/c7c/ab1c1bc7ca4cd0ca22349c442ef4730b.jpg"><br><br>  A few words about what a workshop is and what it is for. <br><br>  In essence, this is a contest of ideas.  We invited our guests to talk about what they would like to improve in the existing YotaPhone and dream about its new functions, features and forms. <br>  The general leadership of the workshop took over <hh user="http://britishdesign.ru/tutors/?id=45">  Dmitry Karpov.  All participants settled in three large halls and divided into groups of several people.  Among those present were many guests from various countries, and all of them were united by the interest in our work, the desire to participate with us in the creation of modern innovative smartphones. <br><br><h4>  First stage </h4><br>  The guests were asked to perform the following task: in the allotted period of time to come up with: <br>  a) Improvements and new uses for the existing YotaPhone. <br>  b) Functions and features for new generations of smartphones. <br><br>  There were no other restrictions, it was possible to offer anything.  We did not set any conditions on the materials used and methods of application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efc/803/78d/efc80378d51eab8679de3de1973d9f10.jpg"><br><br>  At first, the discussions were rather restrained.  Someone was looking at his unexpected colleagues, someone was embarrassed.  Someone, on the contrary, took the initiative and began to put forward ideas.  Gradually, a little stiffness disappeared, and people increasingly began to participate in discussions, write, draw, argue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d2/745/911/0d2745911866ce6c38b650dc3dcda959.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/867/291/955/8672919552d3195c9a2c885cec8538f1.jpg"><br><br>  After a while, we asked for a brief presentation of ideas from each group.  What they want to improve in the existing smartphone, how to use the second screen, what features and functions they would like to get in future YotaPhone. <br><br>  The proposals touched a variety of areas: new programs, new forms of the phone, including flexible and removable displays, many options for using the second screen, all sorts of "smart" accessories.  The range of ideas ranged from very simple software improvements to conceptually new gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6dc/c5a/9ed/6dcc5a9ed88970e8488aa27fd2502228.jpg"><br><br>  After the announcement of all ideas, the word was given to staff engineers and developers of Yota Devices.  Their task was to give their authoritative conclusion of what has already been implemented and what is in development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d2/09b/a80/5d209ba80e7404a3d9f1bd3b20bb7136.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Second phase </h4><br>  Further, we offered each group to choose from their ideas only one, the most interesting, in their opinion, and prepare for its defense.  It was necessary to think in detail about the essence of the idea, draw explanatory illustrations, or fashion a sample.  Someone lively, someone intently, the participants again plunged into discussions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/957/a15/aa4/957a15aa45670d8069ef2e2b6bf1ad24.jpg"><br><br>  During the defense of their projects, the speakers visibly worried.  They could be understood, because it was no longer just a placer of proposals.  It was interesting to submit their best idea, to show others its benefits and attractiveness.  Each team prepared illustrations explaining the essence and benefits of the idea.  Still, among us there are many talented people, we once again saw this!  Many drawings inventively and artistically conveyed the intention of the authors, perfectly complementing the explanations of the speakers.  Some groups, besides interesting drawings, even managed to prepare models from plasticine. <br><br>  The defenses were active, it was felt that all the participants in the workshop were really passionate about it.  How worried and worried the team members were for their speakers.  For such a short time, people managed to rally and worked together with pleasure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d60/eba/5ed/d60eba5edbed55b163094375fa32f732.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6a/841/36d/c6a84136d7b12919f00b9a0fe4720202.jpg"><br><br>  After the end of the defense of selected projects, voting began.  Its essence was as follows: within each of the three main groups of guests, it was necessary to select the best projects for the participation in the final by voting. <br><br><h4>  The final </h4><br>  As a result, several projects reached the finish line.  Their authors in turn carried out their presentations for all participants of the workshop: <br><br>  "Rear Sensor".  The idea is to use the second screen as an auxiliary control sensory element when working with the main screen.  For example, for zooming on a map, scrolling, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a6/750/d5e/4a6750d5e3ad1b58b7c0c4809eb0bced.jpg"><br><br>  "Library Local Area Network".  Once in a place where there is no cellular connection (subway, basement), you can quickly turn a smartphone into a host of a local wireless network for the exchange of electronic books.  At the same time, information about the created network is displayed on the second screen, a kind of sign inviting everyone.  As a means of monetization, the authors suggested distributing in this way some books and teasers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f3/2a2/9d3/8f32a29d3bc5b17cf137186de60c7c57.jpg"><br><br>  "Active Note".  The application in which you make a list of necessary purchases and tasks in advance.  We often think of some necessary acquisitions or promises already in hindsight, being far from the right place.  This application tracks our position, referring to the list of tasks and its base of various institutions and organizations.  If you find yourself in a radius of, for example, 2 km from the place where you can purchase or make something from the task list, the application automatically notifies you of this, also indicating the route to your destination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b24/3a6/580/b243a658058b332f26322705420700b7.jpg"><br><br>  "Live Screen".  The application, which is based on data from various sensors (light, gravity, gyroscope, compass, etc.) determines where you are now: in the subway, in the car, jogging or at home.  And depending on this, it automatically displays relevant information: a book reader, a navigator, a calorie counter, or any other information you need or an application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7cb/282/1cc/7cb2821cc016209a258f3602d8328072.jpg"><br><br>  Gamified Learning.  An application that uses the principles of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25C8%25E3%25F0%25EE%25F4%25E8%25EA%25E0%25F6%25E8%25FF">gamification</a> to show progress in achieving any goals you set, with the current status and encouraging instructions displayed on the second screen.  Progress is monitored through intermediate tests.  Most of the functions of the smartphone is blocked until the test is passed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd6/e4e/614/bd6e4e61401264ebbe178d2957d4f62e.jpg"><br><br>  "Resolution Zap".  Fitness application that blocks almost all functions of a smartphone until the user performs the required number of exercises. <br><br>  The project is a modular smartphone.  The device is assembled from full-sized, but very thin modules, like a sandwich.  Thus, the user himself selects the necessary opportunities depending on the current tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb3/aa2/25b/fb3aa225b1777f0ba5140abbe22a84af.jpg"><br><br>  Intelligent reference program / translator.  When reading any text using the front camera, the movement of the user's eyes is monitored.  If a person looks at a word for too long, the program identifies the word that caused the difficulty and automatically displays its translation on the second screen, an article from Wikipedia.  Or when watching a music video, the program displays an article about the artist, the lyrics of the song on the second screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/548/bde/274/548bde27481fbaf9ddad59fc22834734.jpg"><br><br>  After the presentation of the draft finalists, a vote was taken among the spectators.  You could vote for only one project. <br><br>  And now, the exciting moment - the announcement of the winners! <br><br>  The first prize was awarded to the authors of the project ‚ÄúActive Note‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/793/3fa/e25/7933fae25ef7359f9c906115ca35cbfe.jpg"><br><br>  The second prize was awarded as a result of voting among the participants of the Idea Camp to the authors of the project ‚ÄúRear Sensor‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa0/f8c/318/fa0f8c318534ca2da6429cff30dd81b0.jpg"><br><br>  And the third prize went to a group of girls who were the most active participants in the discussions throughout the workshop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5b/535/ce3/c5b535ce3f5742f3600de50e5ced3e7b.jpg"><br><br>  All winners were presented with YotaPhone smartphones, commemorative awards and all sorts of branded souvenirs.  And most importantly - their ideas are very likely to be embodied in the next generations of the YotaPhone. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The first Idea Camp gave us a very interesting and rewarding experience.  We tried to give our guests the opportunity to put a piece of themselves, their ideas and dreams into the creation of a new smartphone.  So that they feel that for us they are not ‚Äúfaceless consumers‚Äù, but people for whose sake (and with whom) we work. <br><br>  We were enriched with new ideas, energized and once again convinced of the correctness of our chosen path.  We saw and felt your support and interest in what we do.  And this was the best recognition of the results of our work and strong motivation for further work. <br><br>  Thank you, friends! </hh></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219271/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219271/</a></p>
