  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"I repaired" Gateway MT6840</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The laptop has fallen.  Fell under the action of gravity, from the table to the floor.  (I have Ubunt, she is not falling yet, except ... but this is a separate conversation).  It was just that the screen was opened at an angle of more than 90 degrees, the center of gravity was at the back, but I desperately put it on the edge of the table and ... I immediately picked it up, touched it, examined it, worked it - everything seems fine.  Fuuu, carried by. <br><br>  So worked for several months.  Then something began to pay attention.  It seems to be nothing, but the screen doesn‚Äôt seem so worth it, he has got some kind of a big free move - he opened it, and he has to go a little further forward, or on occasion, backwards.  And it gets worse. <a name="habracut"></a>  Once I turned his back and looked.  I watched of course on the screen hinges.  The right one is fine, but the left one seems to have broken.  This was the first thought, then looked more closely, and realized that everything is more complicated.  Broken not a loop, but the aluminum case of the laptop.  Probably the crack first went, then a piece broke off, which rested against the front of the case, and behind - into the outer plastic case, more precisely, into the jumper that was on top of the VGA output.  Another piece kept the screw on the hinge cover, and was tightly screwed to the hinge itself with two screws.  It worked more or less, but over time, the backlash increased.  The jumper gradually sagged, and the screen went more and more.  And then the time came when, after one close, the jumper broke off completely.  Opened and removed a piece of the case, so as not to break further all around when moving.  From this point on, the screen kept only the right hinge in practice and strove to close (or open up to all 180 degrees) from the slightest movement.  And I thought to sell it, now it seems only to give.  And who will take it, crippled.  For some reason, the idea did not come to fix the scotch tape at all.  Clay, epoxy - will not hold.  He began to think where to send for repairs.  Then - what will the cost of repair?  I figured it would be more profitable to buy a new one, but not to throw it away - the technique works, and I used to squeeze everything to the last.  Maybe with your own hands?  But how?  Then I realized - I have a chance!  It broke just over the VGA output, and there is a screw, even two!  Well, until the second is far, let's forget about it.  The plans were to use bronze, from which to make a plate of twice the thickness by soldering, to cut the thread under the loop hinges in the end, the benefit is double thickness, or to cut it all out from the cooling radiator.  Alas, the threaded kit in the home tool was not, as well as a caliper for removing sizes.  I thought and thought how to be, and decided that it was possible to use a metal plate bent with the letter G that was in cash, and the original screws could be replaced with suitable ones with nuts.  I will customize the place, the size is not critical.  A jigsaw for metal and a file (of course!) Made a part, drilled holes for hinge screws and VGA.  He removed the plastic around the VGA output with a knife, adjusted the plate slightly in place.  At first I screwed it with the original VGA screw, it turned out to be a little longer than the other, the thickness of the part affected, then I found a screw with a cap shorter.  Screw smeared with nail polish, against self-unscrewing.  Everything! <br><br><img src="http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/434/img0025va.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>That's how it looks.</i>  <i>The hinge cover bends upwards to a millimeter, the L-shaped plate complete with the mounting bolts does not quite fit.</i>

In the original, the loop was fastened with the help of vertical screws, and I blindly followed this option.  It was possible to make a straight plate, and the location of the screws to change to horizontal.  The loop rotates 360 degrees, she doesn‚Äôt care.  But everything works, I will not change anything, I will sell too, except for collectors of technical chiros ;-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118452/</a></p>
