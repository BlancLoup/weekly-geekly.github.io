  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IconBIT FTB5200U Rechargeable Battery Pack. Mobile Battery Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/416/05a/1a6/41605a1a6e258b23caf7cc70dc041d9a.jpg"><br>  Good day.  I never did reviews on anything, and especially did not want to start this business - but (!) I really liked the device, that I even decided to share my joy with others.  <b>Good</b> things after all attract.  Motive: I am going to rest here in the south of the sea.  And of course, the question arises about portable technology on the road.  Smartphone, tablet, camera, player - everything is useful in the buildings of railway stations and airports, and even in the trains themselves, but on airplanes.  I decided to choose a mobile battery for myself so that at the most crucial moment (or at the most boring moment as an option) I would not be left without power, and not tread <b>boots,</b> sneakers and sneakers in search of a socket.  In search of an alternative, I came across this model: <a href="http://www.iconbit.ru/products/batteries/105531">IconBIT FTB5200U</a> .  A good one, I can tell you, is the choice for recharging all portable electronics in your backpack (well, with the exception, perhaps, of a laptop, although very few people use the laptop on the road, more and more have switched to tablets).  Well, <b>I must</b> say - quite a budget option.  So you can <b>take</b> without even reading anything under the cut, and if you still doubt, welcome to the detailed review!  I warn you: under the cut there is only my purely personal opinion spiced up with facts and feelings from using this device.  Go. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>The method of construction of the article is that the real user opposes the documentation and applications of developers.</i> <br><br>  Further, I will give excerpts from the documentation and explain in brackets how much any statement corresponds to reality.  But first a couple of photos. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Actually the battery itself</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8fc/d27/932/8fcd27932fa1ddf845586b92742cd316.jpg"></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Type of product in the box</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce1/ccd/ec2/ce1ccdec2bf84b6241558bc200bdb35b.jpg"><br></div></div><br><h4>  What? </h4><br><h5>  Appearance </h5><br>  The first thing that catches your eye is a very elegant look.  Well, in the photo everyone could contemplate.  The main thing that I want to note: <br><ul><li>  Absolutely unmarked, pleasant to the touch (mmmm ...) cool surface (I did not understand what kind of material - plastic or some kind of plastic, or ceramics). </li><li>  Beautiful, ergonomic shape of the battery.  The flat end allows you to put the battery "upright" and to charge in this position.  You can also put it on its side and it will be good too :) </li><li>  At the "working" end there are two ports - the usual USB (out) and micro USB port (in).  There is something to complain about - they are very close to each other.  This causes some inconvenience when connecting cords to both ports at once - a thickened USB cable blatantly blocks the micro USB input. </li><li>  There are also indicators of charge completeness (also not so hot: it would be possible to make a smaller division price) 30-, 70-, 100- percent. </li><li>  Well, the power button.  No complaints. </li></ul><br><h5>  Specifications </h5><br><ul><li>  High capacity 5200mAh (it can be noted that it works a little less than the claimed figure. The experiment was conducted on the iPhone 5 (1440 mAh). This device was able to get 3 full charge cycles from 0 to 100 percent (4320 mAh) from the battery, and then the supply dried up. Although, maybe the battery has not ‚Äúsold out‚Äù yet and maybe it will still open up the declared possibilities in itself) </li><li>  Compact size (indeed, it fits well in a jeans pocket and in the smallest pocket of a bag. I would also like to note the low weight of the battery, only 120 grams) </li><li>  Two USB ports (I already told about the ports above - in the section about appearance) </li><li>  Included adapters for all popular devices (indeed, the bundle includes several adapters to popular devices. It's a pity there is no lightning connector.) </li></ul><br><h5>  Specs </h5><br><ul><li>  Output voltage: 5V;  1000mA (well, I didn‚Äôt measure with a voltmeter, but all the portable devices I tried charge) </li><li>  Input voltage: 5V;  800mA (by the way, I want to say about the charging time of the device itself - it is not as long as it could have been - about 2-2.5 hours) </li><li>  Capacity: 5200mAh (described in the Specifications section) </li><li>  Dimensions: 102 (L) x 23.5 (W) x 23.5 (H) mm (without comment) </li></ul><br><h5>  Documentation </h5><br><blockquote><h6>  Using </h6><br>  - Simply connect the USB cable from the charging device to the battery.  Connect one end of the cable to the ‚ÄúOUT‚Äù output of the battery; connect the other end to the device via an adapter.  Press the ‚ÄúON‚Äù button once, charging starts, green LED indicates charging process. <br>  - At the end of charging or if there is no connection to a digital device, the green LED will stop <br>  blink.  The FTB5200U will shut off automatically after 30 seconds. <br>  - When the green LED flashes during charging, it means that the charge is running out and the battery <br>  need to charge. <br>  Note: If an overcurrent occurs during operation, the battery is automatically transferred to protected mode.  To disable this mode you need to charge the battery. <br><br><h6>  How to charge the battery </h6><br>  Input ‚ÄúIN‚Äù is used to charge the battery.  The red LED glows while the battery is charging, and when fully charged, the red LED turns off. <br></blockquote><br>  Next, I attach a <a href="http://descr.mpc.ru/descr/105531/f/ftb5200u_manual_rus.pdf">link to the documentation</a> .  Caution - PDF!  Go to this link, please, and let me clarify what and where they lied, and what you can believe.  The points: <br><ul><li>  When charging, the green LED flashes. </li><li>  The green LED always flashes when charging.  And when recharging the battery itself.  It just always flashes. </li><li>  A red indicator is a lie.  I could not achieve it by any actions. </li></ul><br><h4>  Where? </h4><br>  You can purchase this device at any electronics store.  I purchased this in <s>MVideo</s> .

    <h4>  When? </h4><br>  This device is well kept in my backpack, so as not to stay with the dead battery at a critical moment.  The benefit of ergonomics and battery capacity allow. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br><h5>  Study </h5><br>  The study was carried out by charging from 0% to 100% of the iPhone 5. The battery withstood three full cycles and fell off :) I was hoping to charge the iPod after the experiments, but it did not work out.  Let's see what will show further use. <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  Works less than the stated figures.  Although not a fact - maybe you need to do more charge-discharge cycles </li><li>  I hate it when something blinks.  All the more green light. </li><li>  Flicker shines through the edge of the case from the side. </li><li>  No adapter for Lightning. </li></ul><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  As for me, so is a good thing, even though it has several disadvantages.  If anyone else has experience using portable batteries - please in the comments. <br><br><h5>  FAQ </h5><br><ul><li>  No, I do not put a million photos in super resolution in the article in Habr√©, because they can be found on the Internet at the first request of the subject.  Habr, after all, not for the lazy. </li><li>  Materials taken from the office.  <a href="http://www.iconbit.ru/">IconBIT</a> website. </li></ul><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184356/</a></p>
