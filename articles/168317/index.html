  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Memories of the SAPPHIRE NOW / TECHED conference held in Madrid. The future predicted there has already begun to come true</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What is the next stage in the development of the SAP HANA platform?  What are the new advantages for business carry real-time software (in-memory calculations).  How close is the reality of working with big data (big data)?  How are those 150 startups developing, the emergence of which was due solely to the existence of SAP HANA? <br>  All of these questions opened up the SAPPHIRE NOW Global Communications Executive Q &amp; A event, and were voiced before the CTO talk by SAP AG. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Vishal Sikki‚Äôs ‚ÄúHANA as a Logic Platform‚Äù performance was fascinating and inspiring, to say the least.  Sikka began his talk with a story about the rapid exponential changes taking place now in IT.  He focused on three fundamental driving forces that determine our present future.  The first strength, according to his convincing words, is that the end users now require only well-designed products with excellent design.  This implies the emergence of such information systems that would evolve simultaneously with us. <br><br>  The second power, according to Sicca, is to enable businesses to get any information ‚Äújust in time‚Äù (just in time).  Such an opportunity will finally allow any manager to link and monitor business results and management itself into a single function.  Sounds implausible, but mesmerizing? <br><br>  The third force creates in us the need to work with platforms and systems that we understand ourselves - in contrast to the fact that we are in a duty to study the features of their functions.  Sikka showed how HANA makes life easier for development teams, allowing everyone to use his ‚Äúnative‚Äù programming language (BYOL - bring your own language).  I was impressed by the demonstration of an application in which HANA, using River Definition Language (RDL), separates logic from optimization.  As a result, developers focus on business logic, and RDL on compilation and implementation.  In the past, the blunting and slowing down creativity ‚Äúrolling up updates‚Äù will sink.  Strong applause was met with a call addressed to programmers from all over the world: ‚ÄúYou only encode, we will do the rest.‚Äù

      Shao Y., from Lenovo, demonstrated a vivid example of how her huge corporation, using in-memory calcualtion technology, was able to reduce the time it takes to prepare reports from ‚Äúdays‚Äù to ‚Äúminutes‚Äù. <br><br>  In addition, Sicca continued to amaze us with the fact that at the moment more than 150 startups are using the innovative HANA platform in such fields as medicine, astronomy and predictive analytics. <br>  In conclusion, Sicca announced the HANA Marketplace, where any developers will be able to demonstrate their innovative solutions based on SAP HANA. <br><br>  We, the Soloten team, have become extremely interested in the fact that the # 1 brand in the corporate business application segment has increasingly turned to the developer community.  SAP not only makes its products, it is the largest contributor to open source projects such as Eclipse, for example.  "You program, we will do the rest."  Well, let's try. <br><br>  PS The advent of River Definition Language (RDL) is changing the way we develop enterprise applications.  RDL is an executable specification language that enables collaborative development and focus on what the application does.  Applications written in RDL are more readable, which contributes to simplified maintenance and management of the application code throughout its life cycle.  The declarativity, launch and execution of applications in the RDL protects developers from changes in technology.  However, the RDL does not include an abstraction and does not require a virtual machine.  For example, when searching information in a database, RDL makes the translation and conversion of data between the database server and the application server unnecessary, since it assembles the application RDL specifications into the correct container initially. <br><br>  If it is even shorter, then RDL offers simpler and faster development and maintenance of applications, using the power of HANA and based on the use of executive containers.  Finally, the RDL is open for code inheritance and extension in all containers it supports. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168317/</a></p>
