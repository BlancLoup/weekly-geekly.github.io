The teacher notes the missing children in the <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/functions/journal/">electronic journal</a> . <br><br>  Our journal may contain the details of each lesson: the topics studied, a description of the work carried out in the lesson and the homework given out.  Marked scores may be accompanied by teacher comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/578/bf0/fb7/578bf0fb7abb704453613b252131bf9b.png"><br><br>  Let's see how things are going with the performance and attendance of Danila and Valera.  It turns out that while Danila was ill, Valera missed several lessons of Mathematics for a disrespectful reason, aggravating his position, which is not very favorable due to not the best estimates: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f73/732/18a/f7373218ac26e1f045886a50290e4f79.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbe/9b1/311/dbe9b1311201da05f87f3419ccfb0453.png"><br><br>  The journals use the usual notation for the reasons why the student was absent from the lesson: <br><ul><li>  B - Illness. </li><li>  H - Not a valid reason (the student‚Äôs parents did not report the reason for the absence or the student did not warn the teacher that the lesson would be missed). </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Work at a lesson and at school </h4><br>  After the teacher told the children about the new topic, everyone gets homework.  Previously, you and I managed to forget to write it down or make a mistake with what examples you will need to solve by the next lesson. <br>  In Grammar School ‚Ññ0, the guys receive their homework in Dnevnik.ru in electronic form, now their homework is always recorded correctly and contains the date of completion. <br>  Teacher Vasily Mikhailovich sent an assignment to Valera.  And now he has to learn the theory of Mathematics (paragraph 22) in order to improve his results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e40/07c/555/e4007c555701f683a3dead3443b33dd7.png"><br><br>  If the task turned out to be difficult or incomprehensible, it is always possible to clarify important details with the teacher online. <br>  After Valera has confirmed his homework, Vasily Mikhailovich will see that he can already be checked.  It seems that Valera today seriously got down to business, decided not to postpone homework: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/056/b95/2d7/056b952d73fdf5bebfffeb4402da1cf1.png"><br><br>  In the next lesson, the theory was tested, and the assignment received a well-deserved status - <b>Completed</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/406/350/131/406350131467d10ab6bbb662d602d113.png"><br><br>  And the solved examples received a well-deserved assessment - <b>4</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/578/bf0/fb7/578bf0fb7abb704453613b252131bf9b.png"><br><br>  Interesting statistics: For the <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/presscenter/210255">2011‚Äì2012 school year</a> , 8,075,703 homework assignments were issued in Dnevnik.ru and 225,041,018 marks were received for their performance ‚Äî 27 marks for each assignment. <br><br><h4>  Diaries and journals </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac5/e78/2f1/ac5e782f185abdb1338b6c0bd9a62319.jpg"><br><br>  Grammar school number 0 completely switched to the use of Dnevnik.ru and, accordingly, electronic document management.  Paper journals and diaries have sunk into oblivion.  All grades and attendance are recorded in the Electronic Journal: <br><ul><li>  To prepare documents for the school archive, the teacher can export the electronic journal and / or print it, thereby closing the question of the need to store some data in paper format. The frequency of filing documents with the school archives depends on the requirements of this or that educational institution.  Dnevnik.ru keeps all the data and therefore you can restore the necessary documents at any time. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ed/c34/a95/7edc34a95d27b57b95238c461d76f447.png"><br><br><ul><li>  The exported item log file can also be useful for cases when the connection with Dnevnik.ru is lost - ratings can be set, and then imported back into the Electronic Journal. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4c/91b/e7a/d4c91be7a772328d86040c80b0545054.png"><br><br>  Diary - the student's face, before we carried him with us in backpacks, but now he has become completely weightless.  He no longer manages to forget at home, he no longer corrects his grades, or forges his parents ‚Äôsignature. <br>  While Danila was at school, his mother glanced in Dnevnik.ru ‚Äî to check her son‚Äôs progress: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/660/052/737/6600527376fd404ba482edfa30c4eae4.png"><br><br>  Having opened the diary of her son, she was able to see all the information about the latest successes of Danila in Grammar school ‚Ññ0: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/functions/schedule/">Timetable of classes</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/functions/diary/">Blog ratings</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/functions/homeworks/">Hometasks</a> </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e6/a8f/843/8e6a8f843cbe2c9ee00d2d38c972a17d.png"><br><br>  Let us dwell on the diary of Daniel in more detail.  Here you can find: <br><ul><li>  Total weekly or semester totals. </li><li>  Details for each item </li><li>  Final grades by quarters and exam results. </li><li>  Notes to the estimates that the teacher left.  They can be useful and encourage parents to devote more time to their child's studies. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/47d/c45/126/47dc45126e5efc955d6fc7d6a7108efa.png"><br><br>  If you couldn‚Äôt figure it out, you can always contact our <a href="https://dnevnik.zendesk.com/categories/20049856-f-a-q">Help Center</a> . <br><br><h4>  After classes </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b3/3bd/920/7b33bd9206938b257da5678f26aaa442.jpg"><br><br>  After school, each student goes home to gain new strength, do homework or go to workout - for example, in football. <br>  Today, Danila and Valera wanted to go to a football training session together, but they failed.  Valera decided to clarify what he missed, and for this he sent a friend a <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/functions/messages/">message in his Diary</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3be/41f/837/3be41f837fc2e0a1eb719b64d09477e0.png"><br><br>  Danila was online and immediately replied: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d03/f16/8cc/d03f168ccaf5874d504ee8e7683d609e.png"><br><br>  It turned out that Valera had a good reason: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00c/fa7/e0f/00cfa7e0f7703f773a050da1fa8c4da1.png"><br><br>  As you can see, we decided not to restrict the messages with plain text - everyone can use formatting, insert links into the text, attach both <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/functions/files/">files from the Diary</a> and stored on the PC - all this can be useful when sharing learning materials. <br><br>  Danila gives a friend advice - see the materials on Informatics, which are collected in the Media Library.  At the <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/functions/media/">Media Library,</a> we collected useful information for teachers and students, which can be used to prepare homework, study for yourself, repeat complex topics or catch up on lessons that were missed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b91/8ab/26c/b918ab26cc2a98f4b93550652a248f8e.png"><br><br>  On his <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/functions/profile/">personal page</a> , Danila has all the information that may be useful to him and his friends: <br><ul><li>  A list of friends to quickly gather the guys and go to the site. </li><li>  The tape of events, which reflects the activity of friends and classmates. </li><li>  <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/functions/groups-and-events/">Groups and Events</a> in which you can participate or create them yourself and invite those to whom they will be interested .. </li><li>  <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/functions/networks/">Networks</a> where our partners can offer participation in their projects. </li><li>  Files where you can store educational materials and all the things that can be useful for students. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/75d/3db/bba/75d3dbbba1060e6ec82e11cb5d17dea1.png"><br><br>  Access to each page is governed by privacy settings - you can hide personal information if necessary. <br><br>  Despite his young age, Valera is already sick with football and has <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/functions/groups-and-events/">created a group</a> in which you can see discussions about the games of the school team, her achievements and successes.  And accept congratulations after a well-deserved victory! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7c4/131/868/7c4131868275fddbc6b22604cdf8a8e8.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/895/dad/01a/895dad01a324bad48d7aa62611f198eb.png"><br><br>  Each group allows you to configure exactly which sections will be contained in the group and to which of the participants they will be available: <br><ul><li>  Discussion wall </li><li>  Forum for detailed discussions </li><li>  News we made in wiki format. </li><li>  Files </li></ul><br><br>  In the evening, the guys learned their lessons and went for a walk, leaving Dnevnik.ru until the next day. <br><br><h4>  Behind the gate of the school </h4><br>  For the daily work of teachers and student achievement lies another, no less important task - the control of the educational process and interaction with educational authorities. <br><br>  At the end of each quarter, Anna Vladimirovna, Head of the School of Grammar School No. 0 (head teacher), sends reports on the school‚Äôs activities to the municipal education authority.  Before the transition to electronic document management, this process took a lot of time from her and her colleagues (80% of reports are requests from educational authorities and their subordinate organizations, very often duplicating statistical reports and federal monitoring data). <br><br>  To see the necessary report today, the head teacher opens the Dnevnik.ru administrative interface and selects the necessary report - the Passport of the educational institution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a73/dba/35b/a73dba35b4546906725b071c79393ca9.png"><br><br>  This is one of many reports that Administrator of Grammar School ‚Ññ0 can generate: <br><ul><li>  Attendance reports within a school, class or student. </li><li>  Statistics of grades in each of the classes. </li><li>  Statistics of electronic journals and diaries. </li><li>  Regional report on progress, which is based on the final grades of all students in each of the subjects. </li></ul><br>  For cases when additional manipulations with data are necessary, each of the reports can be downloaded in Excel format. <br><br>  Here is the report on the progress of the Grammar school ‚Ññ0 for the first quarter of 2012: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/abf/ec2/d76/abfec2d762f33db5827114c771739f68.png"><br><br><h4>  Everyday education authorities </h4><br>  The changes also affected the education authorities.  In Dnevnik.ru, regional reports are collected from the entire municipality, formed on the basis of the activities of the staff of each school. <br><br>  For the convenience of interaction, each incoming report has the status: <br><ul><li>  Not submitted - requests for educational institutions that have not yet sent their reports </li><li>  Unverified - received reports that require verification </li><li>  Sent for revision - reports for which there were comments or necessary revisions </li><li>  Checked and approved - immaculate reports from educational institutions </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b53/07f/a4f/b5307fa4f6e060a77c0646df813fd337.png"><br><br>  Report Grammar School number 0 will soon receive the status of "Verified and Approved." <br><br>  For each report, you can leave a comment, it is convenient for when you need to send a report for revision. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cf9/360/ec8/cf9360ec8311490d5c86a67ad337df75.png"><br><br>  A detailed passport of an educational institution is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/680/c7f/c18/680c7fc18ebf4fc4d15b6af8e3ca2cca.png"><br><br>  In addition, the employees of the ministry have the opportunity to access subordinate institutions: <br><ul><li>  To do mailings to a specific audience: teachers and parents in each of the schools. </li><li>  View progress reports based on data stored in Dnevnik.ru. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ec/aac/9d2/9ecaac9d2c343e998be32fc29f7bfee4.png"><br><br><h4>  Offline </h4><br>  We have tried to go beyond the interactive educational environment, adding not only gaming applications to the site, but also the opportunity to make students' leisure time more fun, useful and diverse. <br><br>  To students, teachers and parents were closer to each other, <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/presscenter/125801">we organize competitions for the most creative and erudite</a> .  We conduct many of them outside the network: we invite children to cultural events, talk about innovations in the educational environment for teachers, organize sports competitions, give tickets to exhibitions and museums. <br><br>  In the fall of 2012, we summed up and found that we had collected more than 620,000 participants in our contests. <br><br>  We admit to be honest: the most pleasant thing is to receive <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/presscenter/206069">touching video greetings</a> from our students and teachers and read <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/presscenter/202752">reviews from</a> school <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/presscenter/202752">principals</a> who daily use Diary.ru. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> An example of privacy settings. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/091/8f8/5a3/0918f85a3c35c8a926d62fe471b8c026.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ea/a8e/e04/2eaa8ee0420bed8c38e75885795524da.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159877/</a></p>
