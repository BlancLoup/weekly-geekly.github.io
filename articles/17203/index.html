  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top 10 technological innovations that are not yet in nature</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the age of high technology, few people will be surprised by newfangled gadgets.  And what do you say about gadgets that are not yet?  The ranking of the most advanced technological innovations in the near future is represented by the site Bspcn.Com.  Many of them exist only in the form of concepts, and some even in the form of projects.  However, given the speed of development and introduction of new technologies in the modern world, there is no doubt that this future will very soon become our present. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>10. "Dattoo": an interactive tattoo</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/12e/d37/54c/12ed3754cca9cc12353008f0a48657de.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Dattoo: interactive tattoo" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Interactive tattoo Dattoo - development of the famous company Frog Design.  If Dattoo is ever accepted for production, it will be another step towards the possible merging of a person and a computer.  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãDattoo is to use the human body as a kind of information platform for communication and identification technologies, which should greatly facilitate the life of modern man.  With the help of Dattoo you can easily forget about passports, passes, bank cards, and later on mobile phones, cameras and computers.  All this will literally be drawn on your wrist.  Tattooing (or rather, ‚Äúdate‚Äù) is a nano-device built into the human body, created from non-toxic hypoallergenic materials.  The users are invited to a set of services and functions, such as: DNA reader, recognition technology, nanosensors, interactive "buttons", voice control, bionic nano-chips and other cybernetic stuffing. <br>  <strong>9. Astrium Spaceplane tourist spacecraft</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/588/ad2/803/588ad28039657df7a9f3258b6fb6253d.jpg" width="450" height="302" alt="Astrium Spaceplane for tourists" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Journeys to the stars, already familiar to us, are still far from comfort.  The first space tourists were forced (along with astronauts) to sacrifice the style and comfort of a spacecraft for its practicality and safety.  Designed by Australian designer Mark Newson, the Astrium Spaceplane is designed to restore the status quo and offer future space tourists the opportunity to look into the eyes of eternity without leaving comfortable seats. <br>  <strong>8. Custom Kicks Sneakers</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/8be/3df/378/8be3df378d149f159c94383e67d8d388.jpg" width="255" height="360" alt="Custom Kicks Sneakers" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  At one time, sneakers literally broke into the world of fashion and turned into an art object.  The bastions of loyalty to the brand and commitment to price tags have fallen, and originality and exclusive design of sneakers have come to the fore.  Concept-sneakers Custom Kicks from the company Inventables studio are designed to help the owner always remain special.  The appearance of the sneakers is changed with one click of a button, and with the help of a special device, remotely resembling an iPod, you can find it on the Web and download a variety of design options. <br>  <strong>7. Panoramic Nikon 360 Camera</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cbe/886/b68/cbe886b68ecda52ec15f929a629ac69d.jpg" width="450" height="281" alt="Panoramic camera Nikon 360" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Nikon's concept camera can take panoramic pictures using the built-in inclinometer, which specifies the horizontal position of the object prior to shooting.  Of course, panoramic shots have been around for quite some time, but creating them takes quite a lot of time and effort.  With a Nikon 360 camera, the process will take a split second. <br>  <strong>6. Eco-friendly Honda Cub Motocycle Motorcycle</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d4c/0e8/628/d4c0e8628c6e281cf679659585a918bd.jpg" width="450" height="337" alt="Eco Friendly Honda Cub Motocycle" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Similar to a cross between a vintage bike and a trendy scooter, the concept model of the Honda Cub Motocycle not only looks stylish, but also protects the environment: this vehicle uses hydrogen as its fuel.  If this model ever goes on sale, it threatens to become a serious competitor for other city-typical vehicles: small cars, bicycles and scooters. <br><br>  <strong>5. Compact blister for tablets Pills To Go</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b28/faf/3c6/b28faf3c650e0fb6c9570b346502bea1.png" width="441" height="336" alt="Compact blister for tablets Pills To Go" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  The headache does not let go, there are several important meetings ahead, and is it not part of your plans to carry with you a few packs of pills and a bottle of water to wash them down?  Simple as all ingenious comes to the rescue, and the development of the British designer Priestman Hood is very practical: the compact blister Pills To Go is a stylish container for two tablets and mineral water.  You can take a pill and drink it with a sip of water on the go - in the subway, in the car, on the street.  You no longer need to carry a whole first-aid kit and run to the store for mineral water.  It is even strange that such a simple and ingenious invention is still in the status of a concept.  As soon as there is an investor who is ready to realize this idea, the blister will most likely become a sales hit. <br>  <strong>4. Suit for superhero WPA Wearable Power Suit</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c3a/fa5/51b/c3afa551b2f730413c9861e9d080ae42.jpg" width="240" height="420" alt="WPA Wearable Power Suit Superhero Costume" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Quite a strange, but very promising development of the Israeli scientist Vlad Spetkovsky - a suit that increases the strength and speed of the owner.  The ordinary person who has put on this suit, can, at last, play enough in the superman. <br>  <strong>3. Computer without a monitor B-Membrain Computer</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/169/a28/6b1/169a286b18acabcb3560356bc9c35993.jpg" width="350" height="320" alt="Computer without a monitor B-Membrain Computer" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  The developers of the B-Membrain computer resolutely abandoned the monitor and replaced it with a built-in projector capable of transmitting an image to any surface.  The keyboard is located on the surface of the computer, the design of which is so unusual that it is least possible to take it as a computer in the usual sense of the word. <br>  <strong>2. Credit card of the future</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/83f/d2e/554/83fd2e554ee6688f866445915a3e415b.jpg" width="180" height="150" alt="Future Credit Card" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Paying bills is not the most fun thing, but it is likely that in the future it will be possible to do it at least in a stylish and tasteful way.  Designer Jacob Palmborg has created a universal payment device that communicates with all your bank accounts at the same time.  The device, which does not even have a name, not only keeps records of all the payment transactions you make, but also gives you a financial forecast of your well-being, based on an analysis of buying activity.  Access to the device will be possible only after checking the biometric data (fingerprint, retinal scan). <br>  <strong>1. Timeflex Watch Sticker</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/a10/b84/329/a10b84329903b9f60893198f9cb974ad.jpg" width="395" height="305" alt="Timeflex Watch Sticker" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Externally resembling a transparent sticker, the Timeflex watch sticker will undoubtedly attract the attention of stylish youth, athletes, climbers and divers.  The watch is firmly glued to the skin and any other surface (fabric, jacket, gloves, bag, briefcase, etc.).
