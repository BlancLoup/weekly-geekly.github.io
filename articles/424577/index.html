Mitap was held on September 13, on Programmer's Day.  This is the 11th meeting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By tradition, our employees have become the program director, the presenter, and one of the speakers: <br><ol><li>  Denis Kirpichenkov was once again a program director. </li><li>  Dima Kolmogortsev acted as the moderator (last time - one of the speakers). </li><li>  Andrei Chernoprudov (leading several past meetings) this time became the speaker. </li></ol><br>  <i>What is JUG.EKB</i> <i><br></i>  JUG.EKB meetings are not just new and relevant information for participants.  This is communication with non-indifferent to Java and new technologies.  This is a relaxed dialogue with the speakers and useful contacts. <br><br>  JUG.EKB we do everything ourselves: from the selection of the date and selection of the site to the preparation of the program and the run of reports.

    <h3>  What are we doing for? </h3><br>  Mitap is, first of all, about the community.  We want to unite Java-developers, so that they communicate, share experiences, tell interesting events from life and work. <br><br>  The larger and more active the community, the better for developers and for the market as a whole.  It is always interesting: what about the others? <br><br><h3>  What topics are raising </h3><br>  Everything related to the Java world: code, testing, compilation, microservices, migration, API, Spring, multithreading, etc. <br><br>  At the last meeting, we touched on the actual topic of mobile development. <br><br><h3>  What is the format </h3><br>  JUG.EKB is a meeting, not a conference.  All meetings take place in an informal place, for example, in coworking or loft. <br><br>  We hold events on Thursdays, at 19:30 (so that everyone is comfortable with time). <br><br>  Usually in program 2 of the report, the first report is about 30 minutes.  The second - up to 1.5 hours.  After the official part we conduct informal communication: participants can communicate with each other and the speakers. <br><br>  The first report is usually done by someone from the Naumen staff.  The second is a guest speaker (or several speakers), who often speak at large conferences such as Joker, Jpoint, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nw/7u/9r/nw7u9reeixwztmwa-ycmgyaekiu.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  When did the first mitap </h3><br>  We conducted the first JUG.EKB in November 2013.  The program included two reports, one of the speakers at that time was our employee.  About 40 people came to the first meeting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pc/4_/af/pc4_afky6h0urqzzwrzmvwzpbps.jpeg"><br><br>  At the same time, we came up with the idea to donate speakers to the speakers, made on a 3D printer.  Such an unusual souvenir :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3y/d0/bq/3yd0bqargdgsiag2cvasetqkcxa.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  How have changed in five years </h3><br><br><ul><li>  For five years, we changed two locations, because  they just became small for us. </li><li>  The audience at one time significantly "younger", but now still "growing up."  The average age of participants is 27-32 years old. </li><li>  On average, the number of students increases every year.  If in the first year 100 people were gathered, then in 2018 more than 160 people.  The number of annual meetings does not change. </li><li>  The backbone of the participants JUG.EKB formed.  Many we know not only by appearance, but also by name. </li></ul><br>  We do not chase after the number of participants; we are interested in an interested audience who are really passionate about Java.  We welcome participants to give a talk.  We are not a closed club, but an open community. <br><br><h3>  How do we see JUG.EKB in the future </h3><br>  The past JUG.EKB showed that we have a large audience, there are a lot of Java developers in Yekaterinburg, all active and want to meet more often. <br><br>  Therefore, in our plans to increase the number of meetings, but not to reduce the quality of the content.  You can‚Äôt entice only the ‚Äúbuns‚Äù of developers; interesting content is the most important part of our meetings. <br><br>  Maybe someday JUG.EKB will grow into a small conference, but that's another story :) <br><br>  Photos from the meetings, see <a href="https://vk.com/jugekb">in our group in the VC</a> , and video reports - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1OT-RjbKsrxWqDdZY_bidA%3Fview_as%3Dsubscriber">on the Youtube channel</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424577/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424577/</a></p>
