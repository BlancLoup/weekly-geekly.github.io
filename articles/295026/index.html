The retailer intends to <a href="http://kad.arbitr.ru/Card/baeb7ad8-dad7-44f0-9dd7-55d4dce73c5b">recover</a> from MTS the agency fee of 680.8 million rubles for the contracts that he sold in his stores in 2015.  MTS paid a fee for the sale of not in full, explained the representative of "The Messenger" Maria Zaikina. <br><br>  However, MTS refused to pay money, citing the allegedly poor quality and number of connections after returning to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">Megaphone</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB-%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">VimpelCom to</a> Svyaznoy. <br><br>  According to MTS, after their return, from April 2015, the retailer began to work in this direction much worse.  According to the representative of MTS Solodovnikov, the operator sent the acts of fines to the retailer for about 800 million rubles. <a name="habracut"></a>  In addition, the MTS has yet to assess the consequences of the losses, which may be the subject of separate lawsuits against Svyaznoy, Solodovnikov adds.

      Svyaznoy sold MTS sim cards to people without documents, made them out to other persons or distributed cards in other regions (for example, a sim card purchased in Moscow was intended for a salon in St. Petersburg and as a result, the subscriber spent money on roaming) , a source <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/10/02/611181-svyaznoi-podal-mts-isk">told</a> "Vedomosti" in the MTS.  The introduction of reliable and complete information about subscribers into the database is primarily dictated by the security interests of the subscribers themselves, he notes. <br><br>  The operator does not provide full evidence that there were violations, parries Zaikina.  Svyaznoy repeatedly encountered various accusations against MTS, which for some reason began to come in precisely when the retailer signed new extended contracts with two other Big Three operators. <br><br>  MTS last year negotiated the purchase of Svyaznoy with its then owner, Maxim Nogotkov, but the deal did not take place.  When Oleg Malis became the owner of the retailer, the relationship between MTS and Svyaznoy began to deteriorate.  It was with the arrival of Malis that ‚ÄúSvyaznoy‚Äù after a two-year break returned to cooperation with the operators ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù and ‚ÄúVimpelCom‚Äù.  In 2013, the retailer signed a lucrative contract with MTS.  But after the return of MegaFon and VimpelCom, the president of Svyaznoy, Michael Touch, said that selling the sim cards of these operators to the Svyaznoy is more profitable than the MTS sim cards.  If only because, unlike MTS, they paid the retailer an advance payment for connecting subscribers. <br><br>  In June 2015, MTS President Andrei Dubovskov said that the operator was dissatisfied with cooperation with Svyaznoy: since the beginning of 2015, the connections in its stores have decreased by 4‚Äì5 times.  A week later, the companies announced that in August they would stop cooperating. <br><br>  Due to the gap with Svyaznoy, in the second quarter of 2015, the subscriber base of MTS in Russia grew by 1.2%, while competitors Megafon and VimpelCom increased the base by 2.7% and 2 , 6% respectively. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295026/</a></p>
