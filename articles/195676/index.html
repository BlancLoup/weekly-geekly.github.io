If there will be interest and more volunteers will join us - we are implementing all the first four parts of NFS on this attractive engine (by the way, the trendy 3D stereo is already there right out of the box). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The tracks have already been exported in the exact originals from the fourth part, all the geometry and textures are saved, we are fighting for strict compliance with the source. <br>  Cars we take "with the world on a thread", many came from Forza 3, 4. <br><br>  We started this project with my brother almost a year ago, together.  We are not schoolchildren and novices, we don‚Äôt have money for this project and we don‚Äôt depend on anyone in it. <br>  I am Magento Senior Developer (commercial development experience has been under ten years already), <br>  the brother is a modeler, he is working on air simulators of one big company (the experience of a modeler is seven years already).

      Why am I writing about this project in Habr√©? <br>  We are looking for like-minded people who will help us bring it to the end. <br>  Now we are, roughly speaking, six people and at this pace the project will be done for another year. <br>  In this case, one of these six writes music, two - modelers (they do 90% of the work now), I am a programmer and a couple more people help with promotion. <br><br>  At the moment this is pre-alpha, the final product will be much better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65c/7ba/f8d/65c7baf8da13da13a40cb8d3fa04b6a1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e9/042/d8b/5e9042d8bf673affe8f2463e6e55b5b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05a/57a/a9f/05a57aa9f80abf2eb803e720b4d09d3a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35b/8a1/2cc/35b8a12cc1718c5bee6ba567dd82358c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is a very raw video, the music should appeal to fans of the original: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/p5Z9Kq9Bhmw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjObK8DdctDOg2NSkP9oBHvJPbwuQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I repeat, the project is 100% non-commercial, there is no money to earn on it and it will be 100% free. <br>  On it, lovers of mods will be able to run in their custom tracks and cars.  Until now, there are many people releasing supplements for the first parts of the NSF. <br><br>  What I want with this post is to find at least one more modeler who will join us. <br>  It is necessary to import cars and help import tracks. <br>  Programmers are not really needed yet, we just need people interested in this project - there is a lot already in the engine, you just need to find information on how to ‚Äúenable‚Äù it.  The same traces of tires - 99% probability that they are in the engine, you just need to find how to use them. <br><br>  Here is an open Google project with draft TK and current progress: <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc%3Fkey%3D0Aj8ebV0QdM3adFh1OHBUQUFISm1VeVZKN0tJT193eFE">docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj8ebV0QdM3adFh1OHBUQUFISm1VeVZKN0tJT193eFE#gid=1</a> <br>  On the tab open by reference - the list of cars to import, those that are highlighted in red must also be found. <br><br>  On the last tab - current tasks for programmers.  In principle, this is for anyone who wants to; most likely, they will not even need to program for these tasks, you just have to find how it is done in the Cryengine Sandbox. <br><br>  Here you can download crisis-editor: <a href="http://www.crydev.net/">www.crydev.net</a> , as well as register on that site - the editor asks for a login and password every time you start. <br>  Having played with the editor, you can understand whether it is interesting to you or not.  The resources it consumes minimally, I ran it on the integrated Intel3000 graphics card (the one inside the i5 processor) and it worked quite well. <br><br>  Also, if you can‚Äôt help with the development, you can simply tell about the project by any means available to you - share the link in social networks, write something about it on the forums, anywhere.  The more people find out about him - the greater the chance that among them will be the very same modelers or programmers who will still join us and work with us. <br><br>  Plus it is interesting to listen to thoughts about the financing of the project - as long as we collected 0 rubles 00 kopecks and it looks like the links on the main page with donations are of no interest to anyone. <br>  Who thinks what, is it possible to bring this project to Kickstarter?  Or will EA eat it right away? <br>  We do not use their music and we will not distribute it without their knowledge, we have a person who worked with members of the original team who wrote the soundtrack for the first parts, his music plays in that demo video. <br>  And in my design there are no patents, i.e.  the form and ‚Äúsimilarity‚Äù of the tracks cannot be patented. <br><br>  Advertising from the site also still does not bring anything, more precisely $ 2 a month from it does not even cover the cost of hosting. <br><br>  Here are links to the project website and its groups in social networks: <br>  <a href="http://cryforspeed.com/ru/">cryforspeed.com/ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/cryforspeed">vk.com/cryforspeed</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cryforspeed/">www.facebook.com/groups/cryforspeed</a> <br><br>  Let me clarify again: we are not looking for feedback and suggestions from you now, since the project is still raw as a chop, the meat of which is still running around the yard) <br>  We are looking for people who are interested in the project and are able to help. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195676/</a></p>
