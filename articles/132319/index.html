  <section class="page js-page"><h1>European investors rules</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Traditionally speaking of Western Internet projects, we mean the United States and Silicon Valley.  Indeed, the birthplace of the Internet remains the largest Internet market and the generator of new business ideas.  But Europe is much closer to us than us, with twice the population and much closer to us in terms of mentality.  And the European Internet market is also significantly developed, being the birthplace of such projects as Skype, and there are practically no empty months in the calendar of significant investment events. <br><br>  On Monday, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/conference/132350/">second thematic meeting</a> took place, where we talked about the European start-up market and its promotion.  This topic was a logical continuation of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/conference/131770/">first event</a> , where we talked about the device of the American start-up market and the basic principles of Internet business in the US, which resulted in the post ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/132206/">Our People at the Mass Challenge</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cf456ad7/e4e8b2f5/bdfbe26a/a7010fcb.png">

      This time, our guest was Daria Batukhtina, habrayuzer <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/darena/" class="user_link">darena</a> , an expert in international PR and marketing, the author of the article ‚Äú <a href="http://slon.ru/business/startapy_v_evrope-697067.xhtml">Will Europe be able to compete with Silicon Valley?</a>  "And a regular participant <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/tag/%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8/">Habravstrech</a> . <br><br>  I will talk about the main things that were heard at the meeting in this post: career ladder startups, all-European startup events, how to become a partner of a western company with us and what useful experience we should learn from our neighbors in the continent. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Career Startup Ladder </h4><br>  There is a certain gradation of projects in terms of the level of events at which projects are presented.  At the grassroots level - in the cities - start-up weekends are held, within which everyone can present.  A step higher - already the level of individual countries.  And finally, all-European events held in different EU countries during the year.  ‚ÄúGrowth‚Äù of projects occurs due to selection by expert commissions, which invite interesting companies to their events.  However, there is another way of growth - you can simply pay for participation in the largest summits.  But this does not negate the significance of local events - in the end, not all startups are focused on the global market, but they can easily solve some local problems.  In addition, a consistent climb of this ladder allows you to acquire competent mentors on time, which will help bring the project to the mind and present yourself correctly at high-level events.  "Hurry - make people laugh." <br><br><h4>  European events </h4><br>  Every year, the calendar of all-European events is rather densely planned: significant events take place in different countries of Europe almost every month.  I will not give here the full calendar, because, apart from the actual dates, it is advisable to write a short comment on its format for each event and to whom and why it may actually be interesting.  If Daria and I coordinate, then the calendar of European start-up events with comments from Batuchtina will appear on this blog as a separate post next week.  For now, just links for self-study: <br><br>  <a href="http://leweb.net/">leweb.net</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.e-unlimited.com/events/view.aspx%3Fevents_pages_id%3D1035">www.e-unlimited.com/events/view.aspx?events_pages_id=1035</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.e-unlimited.com/events/view.aspx%3Fevents_pages_id%3D1189">www.e-unlimited.com/events/view.aspx?events_pages_id=1189</a> <br>  <a href="http://thenextweb.com/conference/">thenextweb.com/conference</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.dld-conference.com/">www.dld-conference.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.startupweek2011.com/">www.startupweek2011.com</a> <br><br><h4>  Nearest Summits </h4><br>  The nearest major event - The European Venture Summit (EVS) - <a href="http://www.e-unlimited.com/events/view.aspx%3Fevents_pages_id%3D1035">will take place in 11 days in D√ºsseldorf</a> .  This is quite significant and at the same time closed, in the sense that it is not spoken about from each iron, an event.  There are no onlookers on it, only professionals participate in the event.  You can get there in two ways: free of charge - through the start-up ladder described above, passing the selection of the expert committee or buying an entrance ticket for 650 euros.  Those who have an interest in the European market or partners from there should not be slow - you can still get to EVS.  After him, the season 2011 in Europe will be closed by <a href="http://leweb.net/">LeWeb'11</a> in Paris and the <a href="http://www.e-unlimited.com/events/view.aspx%3Fevents_pages_id%3D1189">Civica European Venture Contest 2011</a> in Madrid. <br><br><h4>  What to come to investors </h4><br>  How to serve and sell yourself at such events is an equally important question that determines whether a trip will pay for itself.  There is one good news: Europe needs Russians.  The large market near by cannot be of interest to businessmen from the Old World, but their representation here cannot be called powerful.  Why?  The key point is that the Europeans do not have enough proven partners with us.  People and companies with whom you can build long-term relationships.  And this is good news for those who look to the West: you have to go and get acquainted.  European events at the level of D√ºsseldorf or Paris events are the best opportunity to go to the European investors and entrepreneurs from the street. <br><br>  So, you are going to the summit.  A prerequisite is a good memory and preparation.  It is advisable to know those with whom you want to talk, in person.  Read, memorize names and faces.  They will be useful to you.  Do not miss people before and after they speak.  It is best to use the moments of the break - coffee breaks or any other convenient time, even though going to the toilet.  Lavatory pitch is not worse than elevator. <br><br>  An important point: do not rush to attack numbers and presentations.  Business relations are built on human relations: it is important for an investor to personally know the person with whom he will work, to get to know him, his family.  To become a business partner, you must first earn the trust on a personal level.  In this sense, the style of doing business in Europe is closer to our mentality than American principles.  It's not even a different level of competition, but in history and traditions.  America is a country of free traders, and in Europe, behind every Eurocent is history and traditions that influence the style of business communication. <br><br><h4>  Traditionally, a couple of lines about what kind of experience would be useful for us </h4><br>  Of course, in our country there is a lack of regional start-up weekends.  The beauty of online business is that it allows you to make projects, the earnings of which are not tied to geography.  And in Russia there are successful regional companies that are known at the federal level, and some - even abroad, and working mainly with foreign customers.  What is it worth for regional authorities, at the level of governors or even the mayors of cities, to hold such events at least once a month even in some recreation centers, even if there are no modern sites for this?  The sense of Russia's innovative development will be greater from this than from the iPads at State Council meetings. <br><br><h4>  And a little about our meeting itself. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8fcb7f96/fe4f5de3/35ca0207/59431bb3.jpg"><br><br>  This event is a thematic offshoot of constant <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/tag/%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8/">habros on Thursdays</a> .  This time we decided to hold a meeting in a new place - the <a href="http://club-marsel.ru/%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%258B/">cafe-club "Marseille"</a> at Novoslobodskaya, and it was a good choice.  It is quiet and spacious, what you need for a business conversation.  But the traditional "March" meeting does not cancel it - <b>today, as always, habra-sitzelki in the <a href="http://www.cafemart.ru/map.php">cafe "Mart"</a> at 20:00</b> on the sofa opposite the bar.  As for the announcements of thematic meetings, then follow the announcements in the blog ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/conference/">Events</a> ‚Äù, <a href="http://kotkin-egor.livejournal.com/">in LiveJournal</a> and on the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/">#habraparty</a> on Twitter. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132319/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132319/</a></p>
