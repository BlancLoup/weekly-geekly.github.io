  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nontrivial techniques for finding business ideas. Part 2, ‚ÄúDo the opposite‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/336410/">first part of the article,</a> I promised to show the use of Heinrich Altshuller‚Äôs tenth method ‚ÄúTo do the opposite‚Äù (ANTI).  The method is formulated as follows: <b>‚ÄúInstead of the action dictated by the conditions, carry out the opposite action.‚Äù</b> Let's proceed! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f72/d07/8a5/f72d078a55b9405d95a4feca1401d7a3.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Reception "On the contrary" for business ideas </h2><br>  Necessary explanation.  Do not try ANTI - ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù the usual things.  If you still manage to do this, then you are a genius, and you need the matrices as a fifth leg as a dancer.  Let's do as Altshuller advises.  Let's reverse the conditions of the problem: <br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>ANTI - TOOL MARKETING (IT)</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>ANTI - MARKET (NEED)</b> </td><td align="center">  Reception "Connect" </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>  Learning to "do the opposite" </h2><br><table><tbody><tr><td width="300">  <b>MARKETING TOOL</b> </td><th>  <b>MARKETING TOOL "vice versa"</b> </th></tr><tr><td>  Make a paid product free or very cheap </td><td>  Increase the price so that the product becomes available to "only reputable customers" </td></tr><tr><td>  Simplify the production process </td><td>  Make the production of piece, manual </td></tr><tr><td>  Remove some features to simplify and improve the product. </td><td>  Add redundant features to increase product pricing </td></tr><tr><td>  Focus on a select market segment </td><td>  To make the product universal, demanded by all. </td></tr><tr><td>  Apply "economy on demand" </td><td>  Sign up for subscription service with regular (monthly) payments. </td></tr><tr><td>  Go from product to service </td><td>  Translate service in the material form (boxed, card sale). </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  It's that simple, right?  Because the examples are children.  Only for 2 ANTI instruments - the instruments are obvious without special training. <br><table><tbody><tr><td width="300">  <b>IT TOOL</b> </td><th>  <b>ANTI - IT TOOL</b> </th></tr><tr><td>  Add software control level (aggregator, mashup) </td><td>  <b>Invert trigger from effect to cause.</b> <br><br>  The first example.  Original trigger: when new products appear, send an alert to the buyer.  ANTI - trigger: when a particular buyer has an interest in buying, notify the specific store about it.  Yandex.Market can fully realize this as a retailer. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      An example of the second.  Original trigger: notify the buyer that he forgot about the basket in the online store.  ANTI - trigger: to offer the user a calendar - a reminder, offering him ready-made kits for the planned events. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Transfer offline behavior to online </td><td>  Move online behavior offline.  For example, we provide anonymity.  At the entrance to the sex shop we give customers a mask. </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>So let's move from the toolbar to the market niche (needs) column.</b>  We take a cell, at the level of common sense, we understand what kind of customer need is being satisfied.  Or what is the main advantage of this way of meeting the needs. <br><br>  Let's start with the games.  They are attractive free exit.  In the harsh reality of the entrance - a penny, the exit - the ruble.  Throwing poslyuyu work, you sit without money.  Breaking a difficult relationship, you suffer from loneliness.  And the game can be thrown at any time! <br><br>  Now we formulate the opposite property.  What is the name of the situation, to get out of which is very difficult?  TRAP.  We enter it in the tablet, and at the intersections with marketing tools we get ideas. <br><br><h2>  Create a trap with marketing and IT tools </h2><br><h3>  Example 1: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>TRANSFER OFFLINE BEHAVIOR ONLINE</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>CREATE A TRAP</b> </td><td>  In the supermarket exit only through the cashier.  And there the cashier looks reproachfully.  Let's do it online!  From wherever the visitor to the online store comes, he can only get out through the basket.  Dumb way - redirection, smart - cleverly crafted navigation.  And there we will plaintively ask to buy, otherwise they say that we are starving. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Example 2: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>CREATE SUBSCRIBE</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>CREATE A TRAP</b> </td><td>  Let's tell the stories of Scheherazade, publish stories with the sequels.  The lion's share of classical literature was written as novels ‚Äî feuilletons and monetized by journal publications.  Dumas, for example, Dickens, Dostoevsky.  Ilf and Petrov. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Example 3: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>CREATE A PREMIUM BRAND</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>CREATE A TRAP</b> </td><td>  The premium trap works if the victim is provided with social proof.  Let's create them for aspiring businessmen and vain consumers.  As in the movie "Recall All".  In the original, with Philip Dick, the hero gets a spoon with an engraving, an alien coin and a blaster.  And memories of Mars are a nice bonus. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9cd/e53/557/9cde535574044181bd8c3992b87f0de2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Paradox of premium: I remember - but they do not remember</i> <br><br><h3>  Example 4: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>CREATE A NEW CONSUMPTION FORMAT</b> <b><br></b>  <b>OR CREATIVITY</b> <b><br></b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>CREATE A TRAP</b> </td><td>  To trap did not want to leave, it is necessary to portray its privilege.  Give your customers the opportunity to play hazing.  For example, provide large discounts on the code of a regular customer directly on the item card.  Let the others envy! </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Example 5: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>SIMPLIFY THE PRODUCTION PROCESS (CREATING)</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>CREATE A TRAP</b> </td><td>  Relieve daily problems and there will be no end-of-trap.  Tilda is good for everyone, but is limited by the layout.  Add to it the constructor of commercial offers and all your sales managers. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Example 6: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>CREATE A TRAP</b> </td><td>  Embed bots with high emotional intelligence (EI) products.  Let them console, entertain, extinguish aggression and win sympathy.  Soul Machines' Nadia bot is already encouraging disabled people in New Zealand. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Example 7: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>FOCUS ON THE FAVORITE MARKET SEGMENT</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>CREATE A TRAP</b> </td><td>  Where does the wealth of Cosa Nostra come from?  Mafia monopolized the disposal of garbage.  And you do the same.  Service those whom the rest have written off in m # Dacians.  Scandalists, tantrums, fighters.  Look for m # Dacians on Avito and Vkontakte, they like to hang out there. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>  Rehabilitate bad habits by means of marketing and IT </h2><br>  Let's develop the topic on the column ‚Äúchildren‚Äù of the Stromberg matrix.  The main function of the niche is education.  Education "on the contrary" turns into re-education.  Freedom from harmful or antisocial habits, ways of acting, attitudes. <br><br>  See, yes?  We immediately had 2 mass needs: the re-education of the habit of overeating and the re-education of smokers.  And good customers: the state and corporations, saddened by the fall in labor productivity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b6e/d34/6d4/b6ed346d45274782b9af048a4604306b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>How to get rid of overeating?</i>  <i>Now find out!</i> <br><br><h3>  Example 1: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>TRANSFER OFFLINE BEHAVIOR ONLINE</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>RECOVER THE HANDY-TO-OWNED</b> </td><td> We transfer to the online rule of "one palm".  Let's make a mobile application with a length gauge like a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search%3Fq%3D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%2520%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B">lot</a> .  First we photograph our palm, then we use its photo as a scrolling pattern for measuring portions.  Got - eat, and the results sharim in the social network. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Example 2: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>CREATE A NEW FORMAT OF CONSUMPTION OR CREATIVITY</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>RECOVER THE HANDY-TO-OWNED</b> </td><td>  We write VR / AR applications for fitness and training.  Reddit's leppermessiah1 of <a href="https://birdinflight.com/ru/novosti/20160928-vr-fitness.html">6.5 pounds per month</a> , just chopped off swords in the game with virtual reality Sword Master.  We connect Makarenko's <a href="http://pedagogic.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000015/st065.shtml">method of ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù</a> : let the monsters and opponents troll the player into a fat and slaughterhouse. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Example 3: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>APPLY "ECONOMY ON REQUEST"</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>RECOVER THE HANDY-TO-OWNED</b> </td><td>  We do the service of the urgent order of services for weight loss.  For example, a call of the psychologist, the massage therapist, the nutritionist.  Something is already on Youdo. </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  And now let's get smokers.  They are objectively more difficult than people with the habit of overeating.  At the service of losing weight diets, fintnes, tons of books and films, nationwide sympathy.  And smokers are intimidated by black lungs, frightened by the laws and stuffed with replacement therapy.  Where is the logic?  If there is a dependency, there should be a service industry for addicts.  Let's fix the situation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c1b/c11/2ea/c1bc112ea0284b708925cc17e33063a7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Let's save Smoker together!</i> <br><br><h3>  Example 1: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>TRANSFER OFFLINE BEHAVIOR ONLINE</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>TO PRODUCE SMOKERS</b> </td><td>  How to wanna quit?  Use the "image of the enemy."  Let's make a designer that ‚ÄúWhat is stealing my enemy is smoking‚Äù.  Simple, visual, with beautiful and scary illustrations.  And let him regularly remind him by mail and in the chatika that today his personal enemy took away in proportion to the number of cigarettes.  Money is tight?  All spent on cigarettes.  Problems with girls?  The smell of tobacco scares them.  Sick of all?  These are black glasses of nicotine poisoning. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Example 2: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>SIMPLIFY THE PRODUCTION PROCESS (CREATING)</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>TO PRODUCE SMOKERS</b> </td><td>  You can‚Äôt just drop a habit out of life.  In its place remains an unsatisfied emptiness.  Fill it up!  Offer quitters a choice of hobbies and hobbies.  At least in the format of libraries.  All more fun than in the 100,500th time to repeat about the harm to health. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Example 3: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  <b>APPLY "ECONOMY ON REQUEST"</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="200">  <b>TO PRODUCE SMOKERS</b> </td><td>  What field specialists can help a smoker?  Game therapists (event), detoxicators with drip, narcologists.  Where are all these people?  Why is it possible to call the brigade on the conclusion from the binge, but it is impossible to clean the nicotine? </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>  Conclusion: where to find the treasure? </h2><br>  We are convinced that the method is working.  For dessert, 3 cards "fish places". <br><br>  A) The tool ‚Äúsimplify the process of production (creation)‚Äù in the interpretation: <b>‚Äúsimplify the process of production (creation) by selling educational materials‚Äù</b> .  Decisions only at intersections with anti-needs (needs are already staked out).  A full guru is complete, but the ANTI is not yet a guru. <br><br>  B) ANTI - the tool ‚Äúadd software control level‚Äù in the interpretation of <b>‚Äúinvert the trigger from the effect to the cause‚Äù</b> .  Turn over business processes, IFTT applets, Zapier darts, Huginn events.  Solutions at intersections with needs and anti-needs. <br><br>  C) ANTI - niche "shopping" in the interpretation of "buying."  Specifically, <b>"buying up qualified working time</b> . <b>"</b>  Decisions first at the intersections with "A" and "B", then with all the other marketing and IT tools. <br><br>  Good hunting! <br><br><h2>  Sources: </h2><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/everydaytools/blog/320964/">"A matrix with ideas for startups"</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.altshuller.ru/triz/technique1.asp">"Typical methods of resolving contradictions"</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.triz-chance.ru/techniques_creativity.html">"Modern methods of creativity / creativity"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336422/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336422/</a></p>
