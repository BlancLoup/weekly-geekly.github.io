Determinism and indifference of the universe.</b> <br><br>  Scientists say that everything in the world has its own reason. <br><br>  On June 17, 2010, seven-year-old Lena wept bitterly while sitting in front of a cake with burning candles.  No wonder, because her mom never came for the girl's birthday.  The day before, magma ripped through the crust of the earth and awakened the dormant Eyjafyatlajokudl volcano in Iceland.  As a result, the flight on which Lena's mother was going to fly was canceled.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aed/47f/52e/aed47f52ea244a9495a8e962988854f5.jpg"><br><br>  Science claims that a volcanic eruption is a completely predictable phenomenon.  Magma is influenced by the forces of gravity, a number of physical and chemical processes. <br><br>  Armed with the knowledge of the laws of nature and a sufficiently powerful computer, it is possible to predict any phenomenon occurring in our world.  Most scientists believe it.  Our universe is like a huge mechanism, the gears of which move under the influence of cause and effect relationships.  Such a view of things is called determinism. <br><br>  So it's cool, you say.  Indeed, in the future it will be possible to prevent the spoiled holiday of Lena, predicting an eruption. <br><br>  However, not all so simple.  Indeed, cause-and-effect relationships dominate not only over inanimate objects, but also over ourselves.  We all consist of molecules, moreover, our thoughts consist of the interaction of neurons.  And as we know, neurons obey the laws of nature. <br><br>  Therefore, it is possible to predict not only the eruption of the volcano, but also the fact that Lena will cry on her seven-year anniversary.  And predict long before the birth of a girl! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I first thought about it, while still in school.  Living in a small town in Soviet times, I looked at the life of adults.  Most of them worked at a city-forming plant, receiving an average salary.  Then they retired and played dominoes on a bench in front of the house.  For some reason, this perspective did not please me at all.  ‚ÄúBut what can I do to change my destiny?‚Äù I thought.  After all, everything in the world has a cause.  And our desires and aspirations, too!  Why does someone want to build a career and someone to open their business?  Why does one like brunettes, and another like blondes?  Why does one like ice cream, and the other kebab?  Why, in the end, I myself thought about these things?  Everything has its explanation.  For example, a boy was born with the COMT Val-158-Met gene, causing heightened sexual imprinting, and watched the TV series ‚ÄúFrom the Future‚Äù as a teenager.  The combination of these factors led to the fact that he married a girl very similar to Alice Selezneva. <br><br>  Usually we think about the existence of causes when things are not going very well.  At such moments, we ask ourselves the question: why I don‚Äôt have enough money, why I don‚Äôt like my work, why my relations with my family deteriorated, how can I change my life for the better?  And usually we come to the conclusion that we must be more active, we must take the first step towards our dream, change.  But have you ever thought that these thoughts of yours also have a reason?  If you become active, then this fact has a reason.  Psychological, genetic, or a combination of facts and circumstances. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98c/ab4/1ca/98cab41ca2074eeea952e3e152c48d53.jpg"><br><br>  We look at Richard Branson as he leaves his private plane on his own island and think: why did he do it?  And we come to the conclusion that he took the initiative, made an effort over himself, made a choice in favor of his business.  But why did he make such a choice, and you did not?  There are reasons for this too.  But could Branson influence the causes?  Of course not, the reasons do not depend on us, we cannot influence the volcano, we do not choose the genes with which we were born, education, childhood experiences.  And this is quite understandable.  However, many do not realize that we don‚Äôt make adult choice either. <br>  Try to think well about it.  Try to consider the reasons for any of your particular situation.  What reasons led to it, when did you make a choice and why, could you make a different choice and why did you not. <br><br>  OK.  A good analogy to determinism is the following: imagine that you are watching a fascinating film.  A maniac in a hockey mask is chasing the girl.  The heroine sneaks through a dark dungeon, and you notice the shadow of a maniac behind her back.  ‚ÄúLook around!‚Äù - I want to shout to you.  That is, while watching a movie, you experience real, very real emotions.  Now imagine that you have connected a device that conveys the physical sensations of the hero of the film.  When a hero in a fight gets a face, you also feel a blow and pain, when the hero is kissed by a girl, you feel touches to your lips.  Such technology is quite possible now. <br><br>  So, if you believe in determinism, our whole life is just a viewing of such a film, where you play the main role.  However, the bad news is that the script for this film has long been written.  And the author of the script is not you, but a combination of causes and effects.  All your actions are directed by the universe in advance.  You feel pain and joy.  However, when you make a decision, it‚Äôs just an illusion.  You could not make another decision.  Your free will is illusory.  Scientists agree with this view. <br><br>  In other words, you can right now take and lie on the sofa, and get all thoughts out of your head.  If it‚Äôs written in the script of your movie that you have to get up, then you will want to get up and you will get up, if it‚Äôs written that you‚Äôre lying, then you just want to lie and not get up.  That's all.  All your actions are fundamentally predictable and you cannot even lift a finger of your own will.  Although it seems to you that it is you who make decisions, because you wanted, decided or made an informed choice. <br><br>  What's wrong with that?  Why not just enjoy this movie without thinking about any determinism there? <br>  The fact is that the script of your film was written by the author, who does not care about the main character.  The universe is devoid of feelings, and it absolutely doesn‚Äôt give a damn if you will succeed in life, will reveal your potential.  Moreover, the universe is completely indifferent whether your life will have even the slightest meaning, or whether it will be a series of often painful, worthless and meaningless events.  Look around: cute kittens break their paws, during a wedding a downpour begins, people get sick, go bankrupt, go to jail, go crazy.  Scenarios of people's lives are full of tragedies.  If you yourself wrote your life, then you probably would have chosen a more optimistic plot twists. <br><br>  Life under the pressure of circumstances is similar to the existence of slaves on reed plantations - forced people, seeing no other way out, humble themselves and try to enjoy what they have. <br><br>  So is determinism really the truth?  Being impressed by such reflections, I came to the conclusion that such existence does not make sense.  I really did not like this picture of the world.  Then I turned to science, and she gave me a ray of hope. <br><br>  <b>2. Accident rules our lives?</b> <br><br>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, the discovery of quantum mechanics delivered an irreparable blow to determinism.  It turned out that in the world all the same events occur that have no reason.  For example, the decay of the uranium atom in the current second is absolutely random, that is, it does not have any reasons.  This is amazing and incomprehensible.  How can something happen without a reason?  Even Einstein did not believe in the randomness of quantum mechanics.  ‚ÄúGod does not play dice,‚Äù Albert argued.  However, over the past time, experiments have confirmed thousands of times the randomness of quantum events. <br><br>  And here our free will? <br><br>  Even Pavlov proved that the human eye feels the hit of a separate photon.  And photon absorption is a quantum event.  In addition, occasionally a high-energy cosmic particle enters our head, which can knock out a single neuron.  Such an event is random and fundamentally unpredictable.  For example, if a particle knocks out your grandmother's neuron * in your head, then at the next meeting, you may not immediately recognize your favorite old woman. <br><br>  In other words, quantum events can affect our brain, moving the plot of the film of our life in a completely random way.  In practice, this may mean that your desire to marry is random and dictated by cosmic radiation.  It sounds fantastic, and this is a truly speculative experiment - it is important to understand the principle itself. <br><br>  However, what does this mean for us?  So it is even worse than determinism.  If you play in the casino of life, you will sometimes get a win in the form of a delicious dinner, but a game that lasts a lifetime will surely be lost with a crushing score.  The casino always wins.  If we divide all possible events that can happen to us, good and bad, it is easy to see that there are much more bad events.  If the laws of nature pull the strings of our brain and do it by chance, then we will be the loser in life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91b/41c/8e5/91b41c8e5f074d03898b149f2bd58b0e.jpg"><br><br>  It turns out that chance is even worse than determinism! <br><br>  I could not believe that everything is so sad.  And again turned to science. <br><br>  Our decisions in life may be due to causes and may be random.  But what else can they be?  Is not the whole list of possible options exhausted? <br><br>  <b>3. The attraction of the future.</b> <br><br>  The following reflections have become possible only recently, thanks to the results of the latest discoveries in neurophysiology and the science of consciousness. <br><br>  <b>3.1.</b>  <b>Inside the biorobot or life in a dream.</b> <br><br>  One night, Sergey got out of bed, got out of his country house and, on a Ford pickup, drove 15 kilometers to the liquor store, stopping twice at a red light.  Successfully purchased a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey.  Then Sergey ... woke up from the cry of an owl, sitting behind the wheel of his pickup in the forest.  And he was dressed in family panties with red polka dots.  They say that lunatics often wake up and without panties ... well, who used to go to bed. <br><br>  Yes, Sergey was a somnambulist and walked in a dream.  But how is this possible?  Who drove the guy's body so well that he could drive a car and recognize a red traffic light? <br><br>  Each of us lives inside the biorobot.  Our consciousness is inside the skull.  And it is dark there, sounds do not penetrate there.  The only thing our brain receives is signals from the eyes, ears and other senses.  Nerve impulses - the only thing that connects us with reality.  However, right now we see the monitor screen, around the bright world.  We do not feel any impulses.  This is because our brain builds virtual reality and we do not live in the real world at all, but in this virtual reality.  To better understand this thought, you can remember your most vivid dream.  Remember, when you woke up, and you had a feeling of strong disappointment.  Was it only a dream?  Once in a dream, Ferrari was presented to me and I rushed home to show it to my friends.  It was just super, the wind ruffled my hair, the motor rumbled, and I was looking forward to a parked car in the yard in front of astonished neighbors.  This dream was more than real, and probably no one doubts that it was the result of the work of my brain.  So we always live in such a dream, and virtual reality during wakefulness differs only in that the brain takes into account signals from the senses, which are turned off during sleep.  Everything that we see around passes through the filter of the brain-biocomputer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55e/90a/82a/55e90a82a0704b27b86dff85871ca948.jpg"><br><br>  So, our body is a biorobot, which, as we understood from the history of a lunatic, can perfectly cope with many things.  Biorobot builds a virtual reality in which our consciousness dwells, the one we consider ourselves.  We can feel ourselves, both in virtual reality of a dream, and in reality.  But who is this me?  What does it consist of?  Can it be built on the basis of the very neurons that control the biorobot? <br><br>  Here we come to a very important aspect that you need to try to understand.  Let's draw an analogy with the computer on which the game is running, for example Tomb Rider.  The picture on the monitor around the character is virtual reality, and we are Lara Croft.  So, in the memory cells of the computer there are electrons, which, under the influence of the program, change the pixels on the monitor screen.  But can Lara Croft herself, that is our consciousness, be built on the basis of such electrons?  The fact is that each of the pixels is independent.  That is, this blue pixel has no idea that it is surrounded by red and green.  Each electron by itself and only at the moment of interaction "learns" about the existence of other electrons.  But no particle can immediately interact with hundreds or thousands of other particles.  However, we feel ourselves as a whole, our every piece on which to build our consciousness feels all the other pieces, we KNOW that we are and that we are a complex object. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7a/983/520/b7a9835200004623b9c7e9521e2ab9d8.jpg"><br><br>  What does science say?  Here we will again return to quanta and find there an analogy with our sense of our own consciousness.  In the quantum world, complex objects are possible that form a single whole! <br><br>  <b>3.2.</b>  <b>Quanta know the future.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The magic of quanta includes such a thing as "entanglement."  A multitude of particles can be in an entangled state, at each moment of time ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù each other.  Such particles in a certain sense represent a single inseparable whole that most fully meets the criteria that consciousness possesses.  Quantum connectivity is the closest analogue of consciousness of all physical phenomena that we know.  Quantum consciousness solves the recursive paradox and the problem of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2580">Cartesian Theater</a> . <br><br>  Ok, so what gives us the assumption that our consciousness is based on quantum phenomena?  What does the free will?  Recall another magical quantum effect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70f/8b8/8d3/70f8b88d3ffb4333b8be5fe482ec6a84.jpg"><br><br>  Many people remember the experiment that is demonstrated in schools.  If between the light source and the screen put a barrier with one slit, then on the screen we will see a strip of light.  However, if you put a barrier with two slits, then on the screen we will see not two strips of light, but a multitude of strips, which are called a diffraction pattern.  Such a picture happens when waves pass through a barrier with two slits.  However, light consists of photons, each of which is a particle, that is, when it hits the screen, it leaves one single point.  If the light source emits only one photon at a time, then after a million such emanations, we will see the entire grid of stripes.  But how so?  Indeed, many stripes are formed only when the light passes through two slits at the same time.  If the photon passes through the first or second slit, then only two strips will be obtained.  Scientists have put sensors that record exactly what slit a single photon passes and a miracle happened - as soon as they put such a sensor, only two bars appear on the screen!  When the sensor is removed, then again a lot of strips.  Then they set an even more cunning experiment.  The photon flies though quickly, but not instantly.  A certain time before getting to the screen, the particle is on the way.  But what if the sensors are put at the moment when the photon has already taken off from the light source?  Indeed, in this case, the photon can no longer change its trajectory.  So it was found that even when the sensors are set or removed after the photon has been emitted, it still turns out to be two or a lot of strips.  That is, it turns out that quantum particles know the future!  At the moment of photon departure, when it is UNKNOWN to anyone whether the sensor will be installed, the photon already knows the answer! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d8/45c/83b/9d845c83bff94ff2ab101ee0666bc772.jpg"><br><br>  So, if consciousness is built on quanta, and quanta know the future, then ... consciousness is able to know the future! <br>  How does knowledge of the future look like in practice?  Let's try to understand the difference between determinism, chance and attraction of the future. <br><br>  <b>1. Determinism.</b> <br><br>  Imagine that a powerful alien Grymz flew to our planet with his fleet.  Grymz saw the girl Alice on the planet and she liked him so much that the alien decided to make her his 37th wife as soon as Alice turned 18 years old.  Galactic laws prohibit Grymzu from using violence, so the cunning alien decides to model and tune Alice's environment so that the girl falls in love with Grymza at the first meeting after 18 years.  And here the alien fleet in full begins to investigate the causal relationships that will lead to the long-awaited event.  Alice is shown the romantic film ‚ÄúDiary of Memory‚Äù, only Raina Gosling is changed to Grymza.  A girl through her parents is told to become the wife of an influential alien, this is the ultimate dream of any well-bred lady ... and so on. <br><br>  Finally the preparation is complete.  In the life of Alice, an event occurs - the girl goes to the shop "Grocery store" for milk.  The grocery store is already waiting for her cosmic polyphilous.  The reasons that caused this event are clear: <br><br>  1. The girl is a biological object and, like all of us, periodically wants to drink; <br>  2. As a child, my mother convinced Alice that milk was extremely beneficial, so now she prefers milk to all other drinks; <br>  3. "Deli" the nearest store to the girl's house; <br>  4. The list can be continued almost endlessly, having drawn a line of causes and effects until the formation of the universe. <br><br>  It is extremely important to understand that under determinism, Alice‚Äôs visit to the store is completely predictable.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you copy our planet down to an electron, then disperse our Earth to a speed close to the speed of light, or place it near a black hole so that time will slow down, then knowledge of the future on our planet will become possible. It will be enough to see what happened on the ‚Äúslow‚Äù copy of the Earth remaining in standard time ‚Äî the same will happen in our case. That is, it is fundamentally possible to predict that Alice will go to the "Deli". </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The result is a wedding, after which Grymz begins to attack Alisa in every way, just like the other wives. The girl is unhappy. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc4/548/5a3/cc45485a32b94c719a3b06e610e5e3e9.png"><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Accident.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In the life of Alice, an event occurs - the girl goes to the grocery store, but buys pineapple juice instead of milk.</font></font><br> ,    ,    ,      4: <br><br> 1.     ,    ,   ; <br> 2.     ,    ,         ; <br> 3. ¬´¬ª     ; <br> 4.

The reason from the future is a meeting with Bob, who goes to the Birch shop and never visits the Grocery Store. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The third reason is the cause of the future. No one in the world could have predicted that Alice would suddenly change her habits and go to the Birch Shop - there are absolutely no reasons from the past for this event. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reason from the future is similar to Alice's purpose. But ordinary goals do not arise from anywhere - goals can be predicted. If Alice knew about Bob and went to meet him, then Grymz would know this, and he would take it into account in his plans.</font></font><br><br>     ,     ,     .   ,      . <br><br>      ‚Äì    ¬´¬ª          ,     ,       .       ! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/089/381/d6a/089381d6ae7d4b18a586c068d6059f67.png"><br><br>        ,     ,     . <br><br> ,      ,       . <br><br>     ,           .

When the attraction of the future acts, we are able to choose the very future (that strip) that is best for us. In the selection process, including emotions and feelings. This is the most important thing - we become the authors of the script of our movie of life! It‚Äôs impossible to predict which way of life our consciousness will choose, that is, there are no reasons why we make this choice. However, our choice is not accidental, but filled with meaning!</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is important to understand that we cannot completely get rid of causes from the past. They remain in our life, but we also have a tool for realizing free will. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dreams this is the attraction of the future? Not.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Dreams and goals may have understandable and deterministic reasons. Consequently, the usual dreams or goals of a person are fundamentally possible to predict with sufficient information. The attraction of the future is fundamentally impossible to predict. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What the inner sensation ‚ÄúThe attraction of the future‚Äù feels like, that at this moment our consciousness feels, will be discussed in the next article. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Difficult moment.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Let me guess - if you tried to understand the third slide, then you had a difficulty. This difficulty arises in all.</font></font> Let's try to figure out why.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You tried to apply logic to the analysis of the third slide. How did logic and common sense appear? Once, a distant ancestor saw a cloud on the horizon. Half an hour later it started to rain and our ancestor was wet. A week later, the situation repeated. Then again. Suddenly, a man was struck with insight ‚Äî a cloud appeared ‚Äî it was raining ‚Äî it became cold. Now he saw the cloud, immediately sought shelter from the rain. The folding of various events into chains of causes and effects is what we call logic and common sense. Moreover, it is on this principle that the intellect is based. And all our logic fits on the first slide about determinism.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, the logic is not able to build a chain of causes and effects in the case of gravity of the future (such a chain goes from the future to the past, and we do not know the future). Therefore, we can not understand this phenomenon, just as no one has yet been able to understand quantum mechanics. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Richard Feynman‚Äôs statement is well known: ‚ÄúIf it seems to you that you understand quantum theory ... then you do not understand quantum theory.‚Äù However, this does not prevent successfully using quantum mechanics for the benefit of people. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The inability to understand such things is well illustrated by the example of a four-dimensional ball. Science claims that a four-dimensional ball is quite possible in four-dimensional space, moreover, it is mathematically a completely simple and investigated object.</font></font><br>        ‚Äú‚Äù  ?           ,   ,      ,       ,   . <br><br>      ,       .    ,    . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/929/8cc/210/9298cc210c3a4350998f570ac4f6395a.png"><br><br> <b>     ¬´ ¬ª: <br></b> <br> 1. . <br><br>       ?.Google      ,      ,      ,    ,  .          .       ?      ,        ,         . <br><br>        ¬´  ¬ª. <br><br>    :      ,          .    : ¬´  ?¬ª. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ae/2df/9d3/7ae2df9d301a4722b0000d836a5f8237.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Suppose we see a humanoid robot and know that it has no consciousness. The robot touches the hot plate with his hand, pulls back the metal arm and screams. But will the robot feel the pain? If he has no consciousness, then there is simply no one to feel pain. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And now we have a robot, but we know that he is conscious. He also pulls his hand away from the stove and screams. But now the robot hurts. Now the main question is - how will the behavior of the robot differ with consciousness and without? The behavior of both robots will be identical. No one will notice the difference. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turns out that the experience of pain is a side effect that does not affect anything in the world at all. So why do we need a feeling consciousness?</font></font><br><br>      ¬´¬ª,   ,      .   ‚Äì       .   ,   ,  2  ,     ,   ,        .    ,    , , ?  ,  ,      .      . <br><br>         . 1.    . 2.   . 3.  . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The attraction of the future is realizable only on quantum mechanisms. It turns out that the answer to the first objection is the following - either quantum consciousness, or we are just robots. But then why do we need consciousness and the feeling of pain? It turns out that the suffering, grief and pain of all the people who lived in the world are completely meaningless and are only a side effect. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, they recently discovered that quantum mechanisms are used for photosynthesis and orientation of birds in magnetic fields. That is, the most incomprehensible theory works alongside us in every green leaf and in every bird. It would be extremely strange if nature did not use quantum mechanics in its most complex and magnificent creation - our mind.</font></font><br><br>  2. Question. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do quanta necessarily know the future? The experiment with two slits can be explained with the help of other concepts, for example, multi-world interpretation. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This can be answered as follows - quantum mechanics has many interpretations. None of the interpretations describe quanta in a ‚Äúcomprehensible way‚Äù. Each of them does not contradict the experimental data. The transactional interpretation of John Kramer directly describes the coming "back-in-time" waves. So to interpret in terms of the attraction of the future is quite correct from a scientific point of view. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Kind of questions in style: ‚ÄúI did not understand anything, so all this is nonsense.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Comments on the documentary film The Secrets of Quantum Physics (2014): </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Leopoldik</font></font></b> <br> <i>     ,   ,    .    ,        .        ¬´¬ª  ¬´-¬ª. ,    ! <br></i> <br> <b>MaxBogatskiy</b> <br> <i>   ,     .   , -       ,        ,     .)))    .)</i> <br><br> <b>milotaur</b> <br> <i> .     ¬´¬ª  ,       .   ,    ‚Äî .</i> <br><br>        . <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Predictions of the Theory of the Future.

Accounts or a calculator also have some intelligence - they give the correct answer to the question. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Computers in some areas already have higher-than-human intelligence, for example, in chess.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/986/5da/849/9865da8490594c96823295fc918de153.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's go further - self-driving cars from Google are already driving around California. Such cars inside themselves build the virtual reality of the environment, moreover, inside this virtuality they create a model of themselves! Just like the brain does each of us. Let us ask ourselves - will such cars sooner or later become conscious and start feeling pain, for example, during collisions? In fact, the right question is another - ‚Äúwhy should robots feel pain?‚Äù. Why do we need feelings if robots successfully cope with tasks and without feelings? Why does our own organism have a biorobot of feeling and consciousness? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The question is consonant with the </font></font><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chinese room</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> dilemma </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can ask such a car: ‚ÄúDo you have consciousness?‚Äù. And the car will respond: ‚ÄúYes, of course, I am conscious, and I can feel pain. I think, therefore I exist! ‚Äù. But can we believe such a statement? Perhaps the computer in response to our question gives only a result similar to the answer of the calculator and in fact it has no consciousness. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The attraction of the future gives the answer to this question like this: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's create two absolutely identical computers with AI, which have the same software. We will train them in an identical situation. So, if in a completely identical environment two computers will sometimes make different decisions, then they have a consciousness. If computers produce the same answers, they do not have consciousness.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The attraction of the future predicts that only computers with quantum elements will exhibit different behavior, and only such computers can have consciousness. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, consciousness gives the computer free will (here we mean that free will must be fundamentally unpredictable)! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, neuroscientists have already learned to read individual words directly from the brain. That is, the test subject thinks about a word, and the experimenter guesses this word on an MRI. Already learned to read some dreams. Many people think that the day is near when a person can be completely predicted. It will be possible to make a computer copy of a person whose behavior will become indistinguishable from the present.</font></font><br><br>   ,          ,    ,         .     ,            ( ,      ,    ). <br><br> ,    ‚Äú ‚Äù    : <br> 1.           ,   ,   . <br> 2.        ,         . <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to apply the "attraction of the future" for the benefit of yourself?
