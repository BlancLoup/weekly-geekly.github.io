The Agile theme is eternal, and ScrumTrek‚Äôs cuisine has recently passed in our office.  This time they discussed work with requirements, looked for new approaches to development and decided how to find value for the product. <br><br>  At the meeting there were 10 reports from the speakers from M.Video, ScrumTrek, ZeptoLab, Alfa-Bank, Sberbank, Citigroup, EPAM, Renault Digital and Look At Media.  <a href="https://agilerussia.timepad.ru/event/568488/">The program</a> was intense, so do not pass by, you will surely find something interesting for yourself.  Comments are welcome! <br><br>  For particularly impatient there is life hacking: in the last line I will add a link to all videos at once.  Do not thank. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/765/f0e/b55/765f0eb55ecc646430a352573d7505cb.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This time the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGQ99WyIHFQs">Kitchen was opened by</a> Ivan Seleverstov from ScrumTrek and Evgeny Jamalov ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/Eugene4880/">@ Eugene4880</a> ) from M.Video.  Ivan introduced the speakers, spoke about the program of the meeting and the topics of speeches.  Evgeny talked about how M.Video has become a high-tech company that is using Agile, SAFe and all new and HYIP methods and technologies with might and main;  told how retail translates into digital rails, and also shared our experience with online channels.  At the same time I mentioned the working solution <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mvideo/blog/342462/">using the blockchain</a> .

      <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/CZLA/2Ee2tBs27">A little about ScrumTrek</a> . <br><br>  The first report was delivered by Igor Filippov from Alfa-Bank.  The topic is <i>‚ÄúI am the owner of the product, and I want Scrum!‚Äù</i> .  Igor told a little story about a scrum master who knew all about Kanban.  Using his own example, Igor described important basic tenets for the novice Scrum master. <br><br>  <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/MYzB/6AJAXgooF">Presentation</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DehKs4zmG3EQ">video</a> are available. <br><br>  Evgeny Ryazanov from ZeptoLab (a toy about that Am-Nyam) told about <i>‚ÄúFood experiments in the framework of the Scrum framework and Agile‚Äù</i> .  Tips on how to reduce the costs of updates, where to record the results, how to put forward hypotheses and how to prove or disprove them, as well as how to make the product manager happy, look in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnO1NQtNf7gs">this video</a> . <br>  And, of course, in the <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/2Dgq/cydsBdLGR">presentation of the speaker</a> . <br><br>  About noon, Alexey Pimenov from ScrumTrek went up to the stage.  Kanban Uncle talked about the Risk Assessment Framework, a powerful tool that allows you to define your own measurements in a risk profile to evaluate new initiatives, a corporate portfolio or epics.  "In the morgue, or still alive?" - The answer, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJI4w57CvU3U">this video</a> . <br><br>  Denis Tuchin from Sberbank held a master class on writing user stories and acceptance criteria.  In the beginning there was some introductory information about user-stories and acceptance criteria, and later we worked out the experience gained in practice. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bKMToWt1Zbg%3Ft%3D7759">Video</a> <br>  <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/Edjm/uEDQ95rLn">Presentation</a> <br><br>  Jan Chekhanovsky from Citigroup shared his experience with the customer in Silicon Valley.  He told about the importance of frequent meetings with the real owners of the product, but not with nominal ones, and gave a lot of specifics of working with the giants of Silicon Valley. <br>  Read more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DZ_Y5ki4Q7-c">in our video</a> . <br><br>  The vital topic <i>‚ÄúStartups as a team motivation in the search for ideas‚Äù was</i> raised by Ivan Spresov from EPAM.  Ivan on a real project showed work on ideas: pros, cons, pitfalls.  Considered the most frequent cases of failure of startups. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DoulqsKJsp70">Video</a> <br>  <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/FQve/rXQRD8Q64">Presentation</a> <br><br>  In another audience, Alexandra Zaryn from Octoberry launched the two-hour Playing Lean game, which drew 16 players into the world of successful lean manufacturing approaches: how to build a product and how difficult it can be encountered in the course of production, how to successfully invest in the product value for the user. <br><br>  After a short break, power engineer Alexander Lesnevsky and Nikolai Dmitriev from Renault Digital told how to measure the value of the project.  Of course, they did this using the example of the Renault Digital lead classification project.  <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/9hib/Ab1BwbMxo">Presentation with colorful pictures</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmnwN5YzqrNE">videos</a> at your service. <br><br>  Elena Kolobaeva from Look At Media showed how to turn a successful domestic product into a successful market product.  The report tells a lot about managing requirements and working with the team. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DAc18oVk3iN0">Video</a> <br>  <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/HGeo/8SoDMRTxg">Presentation</a> <br><br>  The day was completed by Sergey Gerasimov from M.Video.  In his report <i>‚ÄúRequirement issue, or non-technical debt in favor of future generations,‚Äù</i> Sergei spoke about how to describe the user's needs for requirements, and how it was implemented in practice.  Although the report was final, it provoked the most interesting questions, the audience was very interested in Sergey‚Äôs experience in working with requirements, and even the presenters could not stop the evening. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DTwqY4MxK5I4">Video</a> <br>  <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/8cvA/JA3fR1N5y">Presentation</a> <br><br>  By the way, those spectators who asked the most interesting questions during the reports received valuable (honestly!) And memorable prizes in the form of backpacks, playing scrum-cards and other souvenirs.  Also at the end of the evening, M.Video promo codes for the amount of 1000 rubles were distributed to everyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1aa/39e/de8/1aa39ede830ae508955c95d0e86b16bf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As promised, you can watch the entire stream of video in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLDFlQLnb9iBaQYjVbBqOSJdUN2WgW5N2L">playlist on Youtube</a> .
