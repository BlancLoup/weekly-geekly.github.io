      The second part of the course on client-oriented services for students of the faculty "Management in the field of Internet technologies", unlike the first, was held outside the walls of the State University of Management.  The building occupied by ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù on Samokatnaya in the 19th century belonged to Count Razumovsky, who for six years served as minister of public education at the court of Alexander I. It is symbolic considering the mission that day was performed by Nikolay Shestakov. <br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090914/fe428e1f24/4c1d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>Maximum information</b> </h4><br><br>  ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs not a secret to anyone that we live in an imperfect country, which noticeably lags behind the West in terms of relationships between people who sell or buy something.  In general, these relationships are described using a certain CRM (ustomer relationship management) model.  It should include such processes as attracting a client, selling a product, fulfilling commitments related to the sale, and further maintaining and developing relationships with the client.  All these four components should be reflected in CRM, the center of which is the client.  In order for your business to be successful, you need to know as much information as possible about your customers. <br><br>  Suppose you sell cars.  The primary collection of customer information begins in the process of attracting it: you can find out what a person‚Äôs name is, what kind of car they like.  But this will definitely not be enough for further impact on him.  If you want him to come to you for maintenance later, and six months later he bought another car, you need to act at the maximum at each stage. <br><br>  I will tell this story: a year and a half ago, I decided to change the German car to a Japanese one.  So I was so amazed at the level of service of Japanese dealers that at some point I suddenly began to spread this information around me.  As a result, within six months, four of my acquaintances bought the car from the same dealer.  Thus, I very, very well increased the profits of this company, although no one directly asked me to do this - the dealer just pleasantly surprised me and infected me with its ideology in terms of cars. <br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090914/41493fc9a8/3db61.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are a great many opportunities for maintaining and developing relationships.  At the time of selling the car, you can learn a lot of useful things: what kind of cars the client‚Äôs friends drive, it would be interesting for them to get an invitation for a test drive and the like.  You can find out, for example, that in six months a person is going to buy a car for his wife, and what kind of car it will be, and after four months, call him and say: ‚ÄúWe remember that you were going to buy a car in six months, but right now this model can buy at a very attractive discount. "  And most likely in this case, the client will say "yes." <br><br>  One of the main mistakes is that companies use CRM as a notebook.  This, of course, is inefficient.  To succeed and increase sales, you need to follow a few rules.  First, it is imperative to segment your customers.  If you are a car dealer, then you need to know what kind of people buy those or other cars.  For example, red cars are bought by girls, and black models that are pumped to the maximum are young people from 25 to 35 with a good income.  You need to know this in order to competently conduct marketing campaigns.  Of course, there are exceptions, and sometimes 60-year-old men buy small red cars, but such errors are extremely small.  Secondly, communication with the client must be maintained constantly, so that you will not be forgotten.  But part of this, too, should not be - you just need to correctly recall about yourself.  That is, you do not need to call and ask: ‚ÄúDo you want to buy a car?‚Äù, Because you can find out how that car that a person bought from you some time ago, and after that build a further conversation.  Just one phrase, and you have already arranged a person to yourself, he feels that he is being cared for.  Well, and, of course, it is necessary to engage in the analysis of work with clients - to calculate, for example, how many calls have grown into a repeated visit of a client, and based on this, draw appropriate conclusions and make adjustments ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  <b>What is the client ready for</b> </h4><br><br>  ‚ÄúIn general, it is important to understand what the client is ready to pay for, and what he is ready to give money that is freely available.  For a start, these are vital things - relatively speaking, food, water, some kind of clothing and shelter.  That is, it is a certain category for which people are forced to pay.  And there are two things for which people want to pay money and often unreasonable.  First, emotions.  Talking about emotions can be in the case when a person, for example, buys a car is much more expensive than you can actually afford.  Secondly, a feeling of comfort.  In this case, we are talking about purchases, without which a person could well do, but still makes them to change the level of his life - these are air conditioners, plastic windows, and new clothes. <br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090914/2de08b3253/1550f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are many ways to push a person to make an emotional purchase.  The first thing that comes to mind is discounts.  True, discounts have both positive and negative sides.  Discounts serve as an excellent tool for sales management: there is a consignment of mobile phones that are losing their relevance in the warehouse - we announce discounts, quickly sell and buy a batch of new models.  All sorts of discount systems help to keep the customer, he becomes loyal to a certain brand, but only until he starts counting and, in the end, he realizes that he overpays money even with the discount.  Discounts help to expand the target audience, but in a certain case it can play a cruel joke.  If we talk about clothes, then some expensive brands are not fundamentally satisfied with sales, because they understand that it will not be very pleasant for a successful businessman to see an ordinary clerk in a jacket like himself after some time. <br><br>  As for the negative sides, in our country people tend to treat discounts with a certain distrust - the train of thought in this case is built in the following way: ‚Äúhow much the price was initially raised, which now offer such a discount, it will be even cheaper‚Äù.  You should also not intentionally mislead the client - if you announced that the discounts will be until the end of September, then they should be until the end of September.  If a person visits your site on October 1 and sees the news that discounts are now until the end of October, loyalty will be instantly lost.  Well, do not forget about the tax inspection, which is very attentive to all sorts of discounts - according to the law, you can not offer a discount of more than 20 percent of the average price for this product, otherwise, you will be subject to additional tax on the amount of super-discounts provided.  In general, starting a discount story, try to be more creative.  For example, it makes little sense to offer a 10 percent discount on air conditioners, because competitors probably have 10, and even 30 percent.  In this case, it will be better if you donate something, then the client will think: ‚Äúyou did not give it to anyone, but you donated it to me‚Äù.  Getting a gift is much nicer than an abstract discount. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090914/0b2ceecbc6/9e2b1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>What's next?</b> </h4><br><br>  ‚ÄúIn general, it is already clear that the market is becoming much more customer-oriented than before.  Companies come up with some new ways to get information, strive to learn as much as possible about preferences, so that the next time communication does not start from scratch, and the client is pleased with how they relate to it.  I am sure that in the future this situation will only improve.  Well, and finally, I would like to utter a phrase that I consider to be key for this whole course: your clients should not speak about the customer focus of your business. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xahf73_nickolay-shestakov_tech">Watch the video</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69584/</a></p>
