  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Uneducated youth</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone is now complaining about a large number of people wishing to become IT-specialists and a very small number of specialists.  Here they are problems from the first person of these most willing. <br><br>  It so happened that after graduating from grade 9, I entered the college by the profession of ‚ÄúApplied Informatics by Industry‚Äù.  College is a branch of a good institute in the northern capital of our country.  The choice was deliberate and I was interested in computer science since childhood.  After enrollment, joy knew no bounds.  Imagining himself sitting at a computer in some cool office creating a program.  But as it happens in life, it beats, from where you do not expect. <br><br><img src="http://geek.web.id/uploads/post/images/1/hello-world-banner.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  First grade </h3><br>  Education in this institution is standard.  There is a curriculum, there are teachers who are obliged to follow it, session, coursework, the next course.  The first course of our college is in the 10-11 class with advanced mathematics and computer science.  But in the first year I began to wonder.  On pairs of computer science we were forced to write notes on the keyboard.  Forced to do laboratory work on the topic "Registration of mail in the service of yandex."  I thought it was the first course, a normal phenomenon, not everyone is so smart, everyone needs to get the basics of using a computer.  And with peace of mind moved to the next course.

    <h3>  Second course </h3><br>  Here it is!  New subjects, teachers, higher mathematics and management.  The first weeks everything was not bad, and then everything turned into a complete nonsense.  Mathematics was taught to us in the form: "Here are the derivatives formulas, here, there, the answer."  Well, I learned to solve them, but why I need them, they did not explain.  Each new page of the textbook is exactly as presented.  How can students be interested in a new topic simply by presenting new formulas for new examples?  Sometimes you get confused about how they differ from the previous ones, if the teacher showed the use of derivatives in life and showed their importance, it would be much more interesting to study the material, and it would be delayed for a long time. <br><br>  Management, taught directly from the Internet.  The teacher opens the book on the Internet and dictates, and we write.  This method is quite popular among teachers and 90% of theoretical classes are conducted in this way. <br><br><h3>  Third course </h3><br>  Mathematics ended, added other specialized subjects.  The theory remains the same, laboratory work on html and basic all YEAR.  Outlined about peripheral devices or about word processor notepad.  Agree, you probably do not expect on the penultimate course that you will be taught to type in a notebook. <br><br>  An interesting subject "Software Maintenance" has appeared.  On it, we were 1C.  Hooray!  Something necessary.  How wrong I was, because we were just thrown off the instructions on the computers with examples and told to perform in a whole year.  Not only is the instruction not suitable for the program version, the teachers themselves did not understand the program.  As a result, a year entered the data in 1C. <br><br><img src="https://s8.hostingkartinok.com/uploads/images/2017/09/50085efcb300d1bbebe8dc042ba3df4c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There was also an Access database.  Here I can say thank you, the teacher got a good one.  He told, showed and advised.  It was obvious that a specialist was talking to you. <br><br>  At the end of the year we were sent to practice.  This topic can devote an entire article.  In short, we were sent to all X games.  Put at the end of the assessment and print.  And then I fantasized on defense, how hard I was doing the practice. <br><br><h3>  What do I want to say with this? </h3><br>  Now I am in the last year of my school.  Everything remained the same, except for adding Lazarus and writing a thesis.  I want to say that I was not taught anything.  All that I have learned is a consequence of the psychos, because they do not teach me anything.  From this and there really is a motivation for self-education.  Although there is something to say. <br><br>  I do not want to blame the teachers, although of my eight teachers in computer science, there were only two good ones.  I am eager to curse the outdated education system and the process of passing the accreditation of educational institutions.  Indeed, in July of this year I will receive a diploma where the ‚ÄúProgrammer‚Äù will be proudly written.  Cool!  How do you like the 2018 programmer?  I can register mail and type in notepad! <br><br><img src="http://classpic.ru/wp-content/uploads/Studenty-poluchayut-diplom.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  About accreditation a separate story.  ‚ÄúSerious‚Äù people from the university come to us, give tests and check documents.  Documents are all in advance in order, and the answers to the tests we received an hour before the arrival of these very "serious" people. <br><br>  People offer to go to college, and then, they say, you study in the backwoods.  I have been interested in university entrance for a long time, but with every new article I read, a comment and a comment from my friends, the desire disappears. <br><br><blockquote>  Of course, they gave some useful knowledge, but on the effectiveness of knowledge / time - in a deep bottom. </blockquote>  - liked the comment. <br><br>  Do not look for college education.  Here you will find the basics of the basics.  Women 50 years old, who teach the subject of "Computer Architecture" and with it you will be a crossword puzzle in excel.  And on another subject, you will write an electronic notebook in the word, where you need to insert a definition of informatics from the Internet.  If you refuse to write a definition of computer science on a computer, they will force you to write in a notebook. <br><br><h3>  What should I do next? </h3><br>  Now after graduation, they will send me to serve the Motherland.  After the service comes the moment of choosing the future path of the ninja.  Go to work as a typesetter, go into freelancing?  And can go to college? <br><br>  For the sake of the crust, I don‚Äôt really want to go to the university.  Hopefully, if I‚Äôm still brought a passing wind to a higher educational institution, I can find new contacts, good teachers and get good knowledge there.  It is already time to accept that even after graduating from university, without self-study, you cannot become an IT specialist. <br><br>  You will tell me that here, they say, you entered a vocational school and complained.  I will answer that you are absolutely right, but only if the universities didn‚Äôt have about the same thing. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339208/">Uneducated youth.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339208/">The teacher‚Äôs response</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/339284/">Uneducated youth.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/339284/">Business response</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339438/">Uneducated youth.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339438/">How to get out the student</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339434/">How uneducated youth becomes educated.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339434/">University response</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339458/">Uneducated youth: an attempt to summarize and some personal</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339512/">Uneducated youth: yes, another post from the student‚Äôs point of view</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339550/">Uneducated youth.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339550/">Life in the outback</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339754/">Educated youth.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339754/">About patterns and processes</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339878/">Uneducated youth.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339878/">What's left overs</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ascon/blog/339836/">Teamwork and electronic document management.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ascon/blog/339836/">University study experience</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/340480/">Uneducated youth.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/340480/">Babylonian babies</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339022/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339022/</a></p>
