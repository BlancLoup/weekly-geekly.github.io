Soon snow and ice on the sidewalks will replace personal vehicles - bicycles, scooters and monowheels.  Now is the time to think about a way to turn a work trip into a pleasant walk.  As an enthusiast monowheel, rolling since 2016, I recommend this type of transport, and this review is designed to help you choose the machine that you like the most. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mg/5u/6h/mg5u6h5hcfyans-xn-jw2ixctzu.jpeg"><br>  <i>Monokoliso - transport not only for young people, <a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/life/watch-electric-unicycles-on-the-ocean-city-boardwalk/article_f1f39e31-b89e-559a-ac5a-ce79910b1a42.html">source of photos</a></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Introduction </h2><br>  Here is a brief story about how the monocolder manufacturers spent 2017, and with which models they meet 2018.

      For greater impartiality, manufacturers are listed alphabetically. <br><br><h2>  Gotway </h2><br>  2017 was a very unfortunate year for Gotway.  First of all, in the spring they released a batch of wheels of two models with defects in the controller, because of which, after a small bump, the wheel <a href="https://youtu.be/Zkbli97cqas%3Ft%3D4m35s">entered into self-oscillations</a> and dropped the rider.  I had <a href="https://electrotransport.ru/ussr/index.php%3Ftopic%3D47398.0">to recall and reflash</a> defective devices, which hit the company's image very strongly.  Further, on the flat ground, the disappointment was created by the marketers.  The name of the new monocolice, Tesla, caused a feeling that Gotway will delight us with something fundamentally new and breakthrough, and it was theoretically possible, given that in 2016 the company became one of the top three.  Alas, the novelty was only increased to 16 inches MCM4, to which was attached a retractable handle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/70/-l/hb/70-lhbzqy90gbpks6nd0okaxec4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Gotway tesla</i> <br><br>  Two handles (fixed and retractable) would allow to make a button for conveniently carrying the wheel on, as on the Inmotion V8, but, alas, Gotway engineers were too lazy to realize this possibility. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/07nNM1ulOP0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>In order to avoid accusations in advertising Russian video stores from English, YouTube has a good automatic translation of subtitles</i> <br><br>  Contrary to the name, Tesla turned out to be quite an average mono-wheel, which stands out except the largest possible battery (1020 Wh) in the segment of 16-inch models. <br><br>  Much more avant-garde looks like a 14-inch MCM5 that is expected very soon, the prototypes of which have already appeared in Europe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/31/vt/gd/31vtgdgezaazne_juhadbwuhsow.jpeg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6XWaqkqgyw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Available: a new controller, retractable handle, finally a shutdown button when lifting the wheel and a rather controversial idea of ‚Äã‚Äãventilation holes in the controller compartment.  However, the air intakes in the upper part of the body were later versions of the Kingsong KS-18A / S and did not seem to cause serious complaints. <br><br>  The ten-inch Luffy wheel is modernized and presented under the Mten3 version.  The fact is that Luffy was developed by a third party and was produced at the facilities of Gotway.  As a result, the design of the wheel contained quite archaic elements that were decided to be corrected in Mten3. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yu/qo/du/yuqodu6wxrz6j97pipch3s1_3_k.jpeg"><br>  <i>Left Mten3, right Luffy</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vcue1K5VS44" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In principle, they coped with the task, the wheel turned out to be more powerful, with increased water protection, but rather heavy and with a button in an uncomfortable place.  The impression spoiled the <a href="http://forum.electricunicycle.org/topic/8152-notice-recall-for-gotway-mten3-green-fashion/">recall of</a> all models sold in August due to the repetition of the bug with auto-oscillations. <br><br>  Also available from Gotway are upgraded versions of the 18-inch MSuperV3 wheel, the best (of course, in my opinion) in the design of this diameter in 2016. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> Previously, Gotway was known as a manufacturer of fast and powerful wheels with no frills, like music, and managed to acquire its fans.  Now the main question is whether they managed to eliminate the problems with the quality of production in 2017. <br><br><h2>  Inmotion </h2><br>  For the company Inmotion, the year 2017 was quite good.  Having released an excellent V8 wheel in the second half of 2016, the company officially entered the American market through the company-inventor of the monowheels Solowheel.  V8 received the second name Solowheel Glide 3 and ... increased in price by one and a half times.  However, public outrage forced to cancel the last decision, and the price returned to more or less adequate.  The characteristics and capabilities of the wheel are perfectly demonstrated by professional acrobat Damien Goma. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/akyhgKZsGjY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  From the moment of release, the wheel did not become morally obsolete and is still an interesting option for purchase, differing in stable quality, low weight compared to similar models and excellent design with the most necessary elements - headlight, retractable handle and button that locks the wheel for carrying.  The disadvantages include a high price, only one version of the battery, which someone (at least to me) is not enough, and water protection is below average. <br><br>  In the Inmotion model line there is a 14-inch V5 wheel in various modifications, but it is already morally obsolete - the limit of 25 km / h even for the fastest version now looks too low, the folding handle should be bought separately, and its design does not seem to me successful. <br><br>  March 17 will be officially announced the model V10 / V10F, which, according to rumors, will be different more battery, wide tire, speaker and brake light, and, alas, more weight.  So far, there are only photos that are published to whip up intrigue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k7/zn/kt/k7znktntuz4sjoab1nwr0qt-cq4.png"><br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> Inmotion is said to have the most advanced production and makes good wheels.  If it were not for a limited range, they would, in my opinion, share the pedestal of leaders with Kingsong, but, given the information about the release of the new model, it seems that the company is working on it. <br><br><h2>  IPS </h2><br>  The IPS company, which some have already buried, pleased us in 2017 with a completely unique model - an ultralight and ultra-compact i5 wheel.  The new design made it possible to abandon the pedal pillars, creating almost a folder for papers with a wheel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oj/pz/ye/ojpzyecfywmacjy6ymbnqpg0y98.jpeg"><br><br>  Short video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WIcI9oEwXlE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Long roller: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpYnwen0mGM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  However, any technical solution has its price - we had to pay for the lightness and compactness with a small battery, low maximum speed and low engine power.  Also in the design revealed a very bad waterproofing.  So in the end, the wheel has found quite limited application. <br><br>  At the end of 2017, it was reported that the s5 model is being prepared for the exit, which will be faster, more powerful and heavier.  Also they are going to install two engines on it, but it is not clear whether two motor-wheels are meant, or one engine in the two halves of the hull. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g9/13/yh/g913yhl0ir2znheienpwoniuiim.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Kingsong </h2><br>  Having released the 16-inch KS-16A wheel with the best design in my opinion, in 2016, KingSong did not begin to fantasize any further, but spread the design to other diameters.  In the 16-inch segment, the 16A replaced the 16S (Sport) model in the same package, but with a more powerful engine, an improved algorithm for the controller, new pedals, and an increased maximum safe speed. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-MrNSkZuio" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>On video 16A, but it is the cutest, visual and atmospheric of me known</i> <br><br>  In the segment of 14-inch wheels, the casing was reduced and made more technologically advanced - plastic-wearing self-tapping screws were replaced with screws.  Also fuse carried in a much more easily accessible hatch on the housing.  In 2017, we managed to release the base model 14D and the version with a larger battery -14S (in some Russian stores it is designated as -14DS). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x7/rf/vf/x7rfvf78-kmhwkbjiq-joltcnuu.jpeg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVi82sjMRqY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In 2018, the budget model is expected -14M with a minimum battery, without speakers and lights, but cheap. <br><br>  The same case in 2018 increased to a size of 18 inches and called the resulting model -18L.  One of the fastest (seriously, 50 km / h after 1000 km) appeared, which is already beyond the limits of a safe for itself and surrounding range) wheels with a very large battery - 1036 Wh and the longest handle in the ruler.  Start of production is expected in April. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vBhrLbwbjdI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> In my opinion, Kingsong is now the market leader.  They offer a large selection of wheels of excellent design of several diameters with batteries of different capacities for different tasks and budget.  The design of the wheels has headlights and dimensions, retractable handle, speakers, USB charging (except -16A / S).  Also, the models have good water protection, and there were no serious complaints about the quality.  The disadvantages include the lack of a button that turns off the wheel when carrying, an unsuccessful new version of the application for smartphones and rumors of a future price increase. <br><br><h2>  Neinebot </h2><br>  The company Ninebot, having released a revolutionary round design in 2015, was distracted from the mono-wheel market, having engaged, and very successfully, with mini-segways and scooters.  In the second half of 2017, it was reported that Ninebot decided to return to the market, while choosing a very unorthodox design.  The 18-inch mono-wheel Ninebot One Z in versions Z6, Z8 and Z10, differing in power of the motor and battery, installed an unusually wide tire, and the body shape, according to official developers, was inspired by the Batmobile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xe/k8/ym/xek8ymu7qjcr4igfjn3bnyj_udm.jpeg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kah_MeK_Bbk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  An interesting solution is a retractable handle, the lower part of which serves as a stand.  But disputes about the convenience of the selected technical solutions remain theoretical, the production start dates have shifted already in the summer of 2018, i.e.  from the announcement to the beginning of the release, almost a year will pass, and this is not a very good sign. <br><br><h2>  Rockwheel </h2><br>  The company Rockwheel, which several years ago made interesting and very light gear wheels, in 2017 released the model GT16.  It differed strange technical solutions like the main power wire, going outside the case, and the first delivery had quality problems.  On the second version, you can find positive reviews, but, given the archaic design (seriously, in 2018 to screw the suitcase handle yourself?), It is difficult to consider the GT16 as a competitive alternative. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lupN-KL2MUY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  It is good that the company did not cease to exist at all - you can find, for example, such a concept wheel without pedals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o4/qb/l5/o4qbl5yswfpfrrmu04h4cjeoocy.jpeg"><br><br>  Also, there was news about the new version with a completely unhealthy top speed of 70 km / h.  But in order to rise again to the level of leaders, Rockwheel will have to make considerable efforts. <br><br><h2>  Solowheel </h2><br>  Last year, the head of Solowheel and inventor of the monowheel and gyro-scooter Shane Chen announced the collection of money for the production of a new model - Solowheel Iota.  In his opinion, the device should have been a solution to the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù problem, combining the ease of learning to ride from a hoverboard and the ability to move in real urban conditions from a monowheel.  Having gathered at various crowdfunding sites many times more than planned, Chen began to develop a second version of the design.  Initially, Iota wanted to be released in September 2017, but the dates were postponed, and today it is in the status of ‚Äúabout to be ready.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mn/je/tf/mnjetfi8ebhuvcfqwz6-xf1edy8.jpeg"><br>  <i>The second version of the design</i> <br><br>  In the spring of 2018, it turned out that, it seems, production is carried out at the Chinese factory Gyroor, and we managed to find video trips to Iota under this brand.  Also, the wheel was lit up at the Chinese exhibition, so it seems that it will not be long to wait for it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3w5dOgAReqM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  According to rumors, the final version will not have a complicated suspension (it‚Äôs not a pity at all, in my opinion, it was superfluous), and Iota will be in the segment of ultra-light wheels along with Gotway Mten3 and IPS i5.  It is doubtful that it will be a serious competitor, because the previous models of Solowheel differed more in several times the price. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Of all the varieties I personally would choose from Inmotion V8, Kingsong KS-14M / D / S and -16A / S depending on the required power reserve and budget, but whatever model you choose, I hope the information above will be useful to you .
