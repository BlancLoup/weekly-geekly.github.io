This contract was concluded 10 days earlier with the Federal Tax Service (FTS), <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/08/13/604623-postavlyaya-importnie-tovari-gosudarstvu-prodavtsi-mogut-poteryat">according</a> to Vedomosti.  Thus, the company "Ayti" won an electronic auction for the supply and installation of telephone equipment, offering a price of 77.78 million rubles.  But the Federal Tax Service concluded a contract with the company for a much smaller amount - 66.1 million rubles. <br><br>  As for the FTS, the service collected applications with an eye to the order of the Ministry of Economic Development No. 155, which refers to a 15% preference to suppliers of goods produced in the countries of the Customs Union (CU).  Using the provisions of the order, the commission "virtually" reduces the price, which is declared by the domestic manufacturer, by 15%, which gives the manufacturer some advantages.  If the participant wins, he receives the full amount of the application. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When conducting an electronic auction, the same order No. 155 is used, but in this case the real price of the state contract is reduced by 15%.  True, there is one condition - the reduction is applied if in the winner‚Äôs offer more than half of the cost falls on foreign goods.  If only imported goods take part in the auction (with the exception of the CU), then the Ministry of Economic Development does not act.  It turns out that the supplier of goods produced in the vehicle receives the full price of the contract.

      As for the Aichi company, in its case the share of Russian goods (by value) was less than 50%, therefore the state customer was obliged to reduce the final contract price by 15%, explain the representatives of the Federal Tax Service.  Since the company ‚ÄúAichi‚Äù did not agree with this decision of the customer, she had to go to court.  Now the winner of the auction, in case of non-signing of the contract, threatens to get into the list of unscrupulous suppliers. <br><br>  According to the general director of Krok, if you pay a western supplier 15% less than the price for which he is ready to sell his goods, this should lead to an increase in prices for foreign goods.  Representatives of Asteros and AMT Group agree with this opinion.  Thus, the General Director of AMT Group believes that at the auctions of state customers the offer price is often almost equal to the cost price.  And according to Sergey Polovnikov, General Director of Open Technologies, suppliers will soon have to make two price lists simultaneously: for both state and corporate tenders. <br><br>  Note that IT products in order No. 155 appeared only in April 2015, so few government customers managed to react to the changes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293594/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293594/</a></p>
