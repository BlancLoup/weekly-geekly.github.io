  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Corporate blog - do you need a project company?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br>  <i>I was pushed into writing this text (the link is lost), where the author reflected on the topic of differences in products and projects.</i>  <i>In the article, a general approach to a business was divided into product creation or project implementation.</i> <br><br><h4>  Problem </h4><br>  For all the time of my labor activity, I was always interested in the question of the Company's communication with the outside world, the direct customer (or consumer of the Company's services / products) and receiving feedback. <br>  At the same time, the primary goals that I always wanted to achieve were receiving feedback and suggestions on the services and products provided by the Company in which I worked at a particular moment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But due to the fact that in the industry to which I have a direct relationship (Hardware &amp; IT in the ‚Äúbig‚Äù power industry), decisions about choosing a service / product provider are made in accordance with approaches that, to put it mildly, I‚Äôm far away, my attempts to establish Communication with this outside world was not maintained by the Company.  Moreover, such attempts were perceived as very critical, since  The management did not understand, for example, how to produce such a document to a commercial product - a list of known problems.  At the same time, a huge achievement was the release of a list of changes in the new software version.  :-) Ie  The management tried to make any information about the internal structure of the company or the processes taking place in it as closed as possible to the outside world. <br>  But what is no less important, in addition to the primary goals of such approaches (ie, the organization of open external communications), there are also secondary objectives.  These I can safely include: <br><ul><li>  search for interested and active potential employees who are close to the ideology and approaches of the Company; </li><li>  increasing brand awareness (if any); </li><li>  advertising new / promising products / services. </li></ul><br>  After a few years of work in this industry, I was fortunate enough to get into the Company, which, I think, is much more inclined to receive feedback from the outside world and sees not only primary, but also secondary goals that can be achieved when building this kind of communication. <br>  But here's the bad luck - this project company.  It is a major integrator of solutions, and not only in the energy sector, but also in the management of technological processes in production, etc. It does not have its own products, and restrictions on the dissemination of information about the project‚Äôs progress or about the concluded contract or their details. <br>  At the same time, within the company everything is built in such a way as to simplify communication inside, simplify internal processes, reduce costs, etc.  Those.  There is potentially something to tell, but either this is know-how or there are restrictions on the dissemination of information. <br><br><h4>  What actually would like </h4><br>  My experience of observing foreign companies (for example: <a href="http://www.fengoffice.com/web/blogen/">FengOffice</a> , <a href="http://37signals.com/svn">37signals</a> ) or domestic (for example: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/">CROC</a> with which we are connected historically, <a href="http://blog.copiny.com/">Copiny</a> ) shows that a company with long-term prospects and plans for working in the market somehow invests in the future and gives the world Something else besides products / services brings some kind of vision ‚Äúto the masses‚Äù.  But all these companies are grocery (CROC in this case has solutions that can be easily equated to products in their life cycle). <br>  I would like to have some kind of tribune, like the Company Blog, with which one could tell about what is happening in the Company. <br>  But what if there are a number of restrictions on the dissemination of information related to the conditions of current contracts and the lack of in-house development, as well as high competition, where disclosing information about the know-how used can lead to their theft and / or loss of existing and potential Clients?  Does anyone have any thoughts? </div>
