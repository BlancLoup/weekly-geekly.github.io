    <h5>  As i understand it </h5><br>  To fulfill the requirements for restricting access to Internet resources containing information incompatible with the tasks of education and upbringing (Article 14 124-, Article 10 149-), it is necessary to limit access to Internet resources, where there is pornography, ¬ªSuicide and ways to implement it, profanity, methods of making explosives, drugs (and their advertising), terrorism, extremism and all that jazz. <br><br><h5>  How to propose to limit </h5><br>  There is a <a href="http://eais.rkn.gov.ru/">registry of banned sites of ROSKOMNADZOR</a> and a <a href="http://minjust.ru/extremist-materials">list of extremist materials of the Justice Ministry</a> , which it is proposed to use when restricting content. <br><br><h5>  Problems </h5><br>  It is impossible to get a complete list of resources of the unified registry of ROSCOMNADZOR (not counting not always up-to-date and incomprehensible to what extent a legal <a href="http://antizapret.info/">resource</a> ).  You can only check a specific site for "unsuitability" by typing it into the query string of the registry site.  Since filtering in my educational institution is carried out using the squid + dansguardian bundle, then: <br>  - I cannot add all sites to the blacklist, because this list cannot be obtained <br>  - I also cannot fully use the list of prohibited phrases for filtering, since there is no officially approved list <br>  - In addition, by https my filter also does not know how to work, so I have to ban some resources (social networks, for example) over ip, using IPFW <br><br>  As a result, at the moment we are using ‚Äúwhite‚Äù lists + ban https-resources over ip, but this is, firstly, very inconvenient for students (I dreamed that teachers would provide me with lists of sites that they need for work, and I I will accumulate a base of white lists ... but this, of course, did not happen), and, secondly, it is probably not legal ... <br><br>  After writing the article, I found a way to block https-urls with "hands on the battered" (recall that dansguardian did not block them).  It is necessary to specify a proxy server in users' browsers (even if it is transparent) and port <b>8080</b> .  I did this with a GPO. <br><br><h5>  Prosecutor's check </h5><br>  It was she who forced me to write this post.  Since there was a place to be, and there was a place to be an order to eliminate the revealed violations (an attempt to eliminate violations and is filtering on the white lists). <br>  It looked like this: A girl came in form, visited the library.  On the library computers I looked at the browser history, followed the link from the history on the anonymizer on VKontakte, then typed ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù in the search - I received a couple of links, then I found something to make bombs and that's it.  After that, there was a nice conversation with my boss that ‚Äúyou have the work, we see it is underway ... you just need to finish this and that ... etc.‚Äù.  Then a prescription was written out, where the director and the secondary vocational institution "were not praised".  After some time, a meeting was convened with the director with the participation of this representative of the prosecutor's office.  At the meeting, I asked all the above listed questions about lists and phrases to which I, of course, did not receive an answer.  General phrases like ‚Äúwell, you track,‚Äù ‚Äúyou contribute,‚Äù ‚Äúcheck the history once a week,‚Äù and all ... <br><br><h5>  Questions to the community </h5><br>  Since I fully admit that I may not know about any solutions that are already working, or misunderstand the essence of the requirements, or not know / know something else, then I ask for help.  How not to violate the law, to satisfy the "freedom of access to information" of students, it is desirable to solve all the forces of open source and without blood?  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202488/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202488/</a></p>
