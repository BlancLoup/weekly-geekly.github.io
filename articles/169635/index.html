      In fact, the post is excellent, I suggest the author to return it. <br><br>  In general, I suggest everyone to add posts and authors more often, even if you do not agree with the opinions, but they are well written!  Polar points of view is good, it is an excellent incentive for the development of social thought, it is an excellent ground for better analysis and more relevant conclusions. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are a couple of questions.  I'll give them here, if I may.  Probably someone else would be interested.  Let's discuss? <br><br>  I am a programmer, and part-time very often have to act as a developer of UI.  Colleagues will understand me. <br><br>  Ten times it happened ... we get pictures from the designer, typeset, release alpha or beta in design.  Naturally, the following happens: <br>  - some buttons and other interface elements are unclaimed (forms, for example); <br>  - a few buttons and interface elements are missing; <br>  - some buttons and other interface elements are ‚Äúnot there‚Äù or look ‚Äúnot so‚Äù (an example is given below). <br><br>  We ask the designer to modify - and a tantrum happens to him.  He has an author's vision, and we are all fuckers here.  This is about ten designers located in different geographical locations, different experiences, pathos and skills.  Repeat, deja vu, for more than 10 years. <br><br>  I had to change the designers.  Looking for new, asked to remake. <br><br>  The second picture, a private fresh case. <br><br>  Making an instant messenger.  The interface implies an address book, the designer draws around each username three buttons: ‚Äúvideo call‚Äù, ‚Äúaudio call‚Äù, ‚Äútext message‚Äù.  The designer makes the buttons small, literally 4 millimeters, and a millimeter of the distance between them.  Touch interface!  App for tablets.  Accurately hit the button with your finger - almost unreal.  Especially on the go. <br><br>  We ask the designer to remake the buttons - to increase them, or to make it so that when you click on the user name at the bottom, there is a pad with large buttons, another five options are offered. <br><br>  The designer was hysterical.  He has the author's vision, he made a beautiful harmonious layout, and we are suckers.  Refuse to accept reviews and modify. <br><br>  I had to change the designer.  Looking for a new, asked to remake. <br><br>  The third picture. <br><br>  Making an application for logisticians.  In the interface - dozens of varieties of tables, which reflect the movement of goods, cars with goods, cargo in airplanes and trains, collective shipments and detailing. <br><br>  The customer gave the layouts drawn by the designer.  In layouts, logic, to put it mildly, is not thought out.  A bunch of controls, essentially drawn spontaneously.  Although beautiful. <br><br>  We developed use cases, and as a result, the number of controls was reduced.  On each page, from 10-20 design ideas - up to 2-3 simple large buttons that are comfortable and do everything. <br><br>  The source code was cool sliders, filters on the tables, accordions and switches.  We used the results of interviews with users as initial data for user cases.  They also showed the prototype, they also experimented.  Users found that two large buttons are better than two dozen "freaks".  They work with it. <br><br>  Naturally, in the process of gloss and harmony is lost.  They took screenshots from the prototype, and returned it with a request to complete design. <br><br>  The designer is hysterical ... He is cool, we are suckers and do not understand anything.  We are looking for a new one, moreover, at our own expense. <br><br>  Prototyping helps to avoid all these situations.  Scrupulous study of the use case, designing the interface in several steps, developing a full-featured prototype, testing the interfaces on people, repeating correction cycles ... <b>Tens to hundreds of hours, money, blood and sweat to get an interface convenient for people.</b>  <b>And five hours of designer work, before or after.</b> <br><br>  When we give the designer a prototype - he makes candy out of it in one go.  In this case, no one is hysterical. <br><br>  I do not claim that someone is right, but someone is wrong.  I want to ask questions. <br><br>  1. Why, when designers are asked to remake something, tantrums happen to them?  Moreover, the more substantial the improvements - the more terrible tantrums. <br>  2. Prototyping does limit the freedom of flight of creative thought, but it greatly reduces the likelihood of the need for rework.  Thus, less likely design hysteria.  This does not justify the use of the method? <br><br>  Or maybe I did not come across such designers? <br><br>  Over the past 12 years, changed 4 jobs.  Worked in studios and freelance.  The situations described are repeated from time to time, regardless of the circumstances. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169635/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169635/</a></p>
