Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93e/38e/5b5/93e38e5b5ff84bccaea04c6f777e2b9f.jpg" alt="Smartphone Megaphone Login 3" align="left" width="125" height="154">  For some reason, the first lines when writing this post I want to recall the article by a well-known party leader with a loud title "Dizzy with success ...".  Its name can serve as a kind of epigraph to this review.  For those who still do not know, relatively recently, MegaFon introduced a new smartphone from the popular Megafon Login - Megaphone Login 3 line. From the beginning of February, it can already be purchased at the company's retail network of mobile stores, however, amid the widely advertised Megaphone Login + pro, which not so long ago already <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/246552/">wrote</a> on GT its appearance went completely unnoticed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is necessary to admit, since the ‚Äúsecond version‚Äù of logins, I closely followed the entire line of branded devices from Megaphone, since  I was extremely interested in what we will see in the ‚Äúthird release‚Äù.  The prerequisites were extremely good.  Judge for yourself, after Megafon Login 2 (MS3A), we saw the Login 3 tablet on a Qualcomm chipset, which was pretty good in its technical specifications for a cost of ~ 3000 rubles.  (Now, due to the economic situation, the price soared to nearly 6,000 rubles), the victorious procession of Login + across all of the country's advertising billboards - quite expectedly, a worthy continuation of the Login'ov line in the form of a smartphone.  However, the miracle did not happen ... <br><br>  Smartphone Megafon Login 3, even for a budget model, came out very mediocre and in many respects resembled its predecessor Login 2, starting from the appearance and ending with the technical characteristics.

No "frills" like headphones, etc.  not provided: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/756/3c5/973/7563c5973b9c4e64a81855716b2a18f2.jpg" alt="Megafon Login 3"></div><br><br>  The smartphone supports 2G communication standards (GSM 1800 / GSM 1900 / GSM 850 / GSM 900) and 3G (UMTS 2100 / UMTS 900) and is based on MediaTek's dual-core chip from MediaTek MT6572M (clock frequency 1 Ghz).  The Mali-400 MP is the video subsystem here.  The amount of RAM - 512 Mb, internal memory - 4 Gb, of which approximately 2 Gb is available for storing user data.  Display - TFT, 3.5 "with a maximum resolution of 320x480 pixels. The resolution of the main camera is 2 Mpix. WiFi, GPS and FM radio are supported, while the wired headset is used as an antenna. The only advantage, perhaps, if you can call it that - is modern Android OS 4.4.2. <br><br>  A set of pre-installed applications is fairly standard, with the exception, perhaps, of free Internet Security from Kaspersky Lab.  All pre-installed applications are visible in the following screenshot: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b1/f9c/fe9/7b1f9cfe989245b082bc9fb803ff6aa7.jpg" alt="Megaphone Login 3. Pre-installed applications."></div><br><br>  The performance of the smartphone in the same AnTuTu is predictable, ~ 10,000 "parrots": <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ed/927/f5c/7ed927f5c30b497bb72fc8b73b78aa1f.jpg" alt="Performance Megaphone Login 3 in Antutu Benchmark"></div><br><br>  Bring here the tests of the only 2 Mpix camera, GPS, etc.  - probably does not make sense, because  in terms of the camera, surely everyone imagines what 2 MPix is.  Using the same GPS on this phone is a bit inconvenient due to the small size of the screen and the quality of the matrix.  If you hang the phone on the car mount on the windshield, then I, for example, see little there, because  firstly, everything is very shallow, secondly, when the viewing angle changes, the image loses much brightness / contrast, or even color inversion occurs, and thirdly, the positioning accuracy, compared to even the same Megafon Login 3 tablet , a little lame. <br><br>  <b>As a summary: An</b> event that everyone has been waiting for has happened so long - a ‚Äúmythical‚Äù Megaphone Login 3 has finally appeared in sales. ‚ÄúMythical‚Äù - because there were a lot of rumors about what this could be for the device on the Internet.  Someone hoped that LTE support would appear in Login 3 and that the smartphone would be a worthy replacement for the Archive Megaphone 4G Turbo model, someone just waited for a high-quality smart phone with a large screen, by analogy with the MTS Smart Run for example (which for some reason users recognized as the <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/gadget/2014">best operator's smartphone of 2014</a> - by the way, in the category ‚ÄúBest carrier's smartphone‚Äù - Smart Run - 1st place, Megaphone Optima - 2nd place and Beeline Smart 3rd - 3rd) ... But neither of these things happened .  Under the proud name of Megafon Login 3, the operator actually presented us with the same 3.5 "Login 2, only‚Äú a little bit different. ‚ÄùI would say the same ... but I won‚Äôt. The profile is clear. So we got 3.5‚Äù smart , with Android 4.4.2, dual-core MediaTek MT6572M (1 GHz), 512 Mb RAM and 2 Mpix main camera at a price of 2490 rubles.  This is in 2015, the year when all operators and Megaphone including, for the same price, you can find a 4 "smartphone - and not an unlocked operator. For examples, you don‚Äôt need to go far, on the same MegaFon website - ZTE V815, the same 2490, but 4 "and the absence of simlock. <br><br>  For a smartphone with similar characteristics, besides "locked up" for the operator - the price is clearly too high.  If we compare it with branded models from other manufacturers, then an adequate price for a device with similar characteristics can be seen from MTS in the MTS 970 model. The price stated on the official website is 890 rubles.  (here it is really worth noting that this smartphone has already been removed from sales and it is unrealistic to purchase it at this price with a new one).  If Megafon changed the terms of the acquisition of Megafon Login 3, for example, the same 2490 rubles.  of which 1000 rubles.  the phone itself, and 1490 rubles.  on the bill - then the proposal would be interesting.  In the current version, under the same conditions, I would simply buy a ZTE V815 or any other 4 "model. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377069/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377069/</a></p>
