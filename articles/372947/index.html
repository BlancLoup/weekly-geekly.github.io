With you again Alexander Shub - an expert in the subject of automotive DVRs.  Let me remind you that my experience in testing devices of this type has exceeded five years, and the number of closely studied models approaches two hundred.  Today, we have a South Korean <a href="https://blackvue.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dobzor%26utm_campaign%3Dblackvue-450">BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS</a> recorder on the cutting table.  Exactly, on the cutting, - I will not just talk about its capabilities and features, but also analyze this model.  This is not a superfluous moment, believe me: sometimes this or that electronic device looks perfect, but in its depths you can find very remarkable evidence of the devil-may-take approach of developers to create their offspring.  (Here is an example of such a situation: two identical external recorders were <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/184198/">disassembled</a> , but inside they turned out to be very different.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ae/718/336/5ae7183367d44b44a87414de5c9e0574.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  BlackVue has been present on the Russian market since 2013, with about 80 percent of the market in the segment ‚Äúfrom 20 thousand rubles‚Äù.  That is, four out of five premium autoreggs sold in Russia bear the ‚Äústigma‚Äù of BlackVue.  In Korea, the situation is even better for the company: there it is the undisputed market leader, selling more than a million devices per year (the total market volume of auto regs in Russia, by the way, in 2015 did not exceed 2.5 million in units).  BlackVue products are also sold in the USA, the UK and several other European countries. <br><br>  The registrars are assembled in their own factories; a team of fifty professional engineers is responsible for the development.  This is you, damn it, not 4-5 Chinese after technical vocational schools - such ‚Äúteams of pain and despair‚Äù usually stand behind the Chinese auto regs.  With relevant results ...

      Among the know-how developed in BlackVue, it is worthwhile to single out a cylindrical form factor for recorders - for the first time it appeared in BlackVue models.  Later, this rather successful form was copied by both Chinese and less eminent Koreans - ThinkWare, FineVu, Cowon (yes, the latter has long been engaged not only in MP3 players). <br><br>  Another know-how of BlackVue, already this year, 2016 is cloud services, which allow to turn the recorder into an auto-alarm system and a full-featured tracking system for the car, plus conduct live video transmissions of the video recorded by the recorder to the Internet.  This is not found in any other DVRs of any other manufacturers - only in the top BlackVue family DR650S. <br><br>  As for our hero, the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS, this, as the developers themselves say, ‚Äúis the most budget premium GPS recorder‚Äù ... Stop!  It sounds strange somehow - here you are both ‚Äúbudget‚Äù and ‚Äúpremium‚Äù.  But in fact, there is logic in such a florid characteristic.  BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS is indeed the cheapest (13,250 rubles) recorder with a GPS module in the BlackVue lineup, only its version without GPS ‚Äî BlackVue DR450-1CH (11,450 rubles) costs less.  On the other hand, the model in question is really premium - at least in terms of video recording quality - and this is the most important thing for a registrar.  By this very quality, the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS video is comparable to the same BlackVue DR650S line models, which stand for the G20, and noticeably outperforms the top Chinese models offered for 12-13 thousand rubles. <br><br>  In general, the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS is one of the most inexpensive ‚Äútickets‚Äù to the world of the coming Korean recorders.  This ‚Äúticket‚Äù is not in place in the first class, of course, but rather in the economy class, but one should not forget that if the Korean region can be compared with the plane in terms of technology, then the Chinese and Chinese-Russian ones can‚Äôt the most modern train.  The analogy, I think, is clear. <br><br>
<h2>  <b>Specifications</b> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c25/1ab/620/c251ab6203cc4c8e881235bf99b03121.png"><br><br><h2>  <b>Design</b> </h2><br>  The BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS, like most other BlackVue models, is cylindrical.  Material - plastic, the assembly is very neat.  In general, the ideal fit of the panels in the recorders is rare, and it was more pleasant to see it here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/242/e4a/6e9/242e4a6e9b064fe9bb2270eefdc07275.png"><br><br>  The lens is on the front panel, which is logical.  Below it is an LED that notifies the user that the recorder is recording. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e2/d3e/631/3e2d3e63167f400ebd8dce5bb86689a1.jpeg"><br><br>  On the side that looks at the salon, there are indicators of GPS and video, as well as the speaker.  Since there is no screen in the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS, the speaker plays a particularly important role: it is with its help that messages about the activation of certain modes of operation are reproduced - for example, ‚Äúthe recording has started‚Äù.  System alerts are reproduced in a pleasant female voice, and in Russian.  It's nice that in Korea they attended to the thorough Russification of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69c/d0e/65f/69cd0e65f38245e5a5d4a028392af48d.jpeg"><br><br>  On the right side of the case is a lid with a hole that opens access to the power ports and connect an external GPS receiver.  If you move the cover to the side, we will see a slot for a memory card.  Note: a loop is coming out of the recorder body, passing through the cover when the latter is closed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a1/4a6/de9/9a14a6de90734e93883e75359b7ddde5.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b75/0af/02a/b750af02a8a54430ad841cb39db223a5.jpeg"><br><br>  I did not immediately understand what it was;  then it turned out that BlackVue offered to protect the memory card from being removed with the help of a ... padlock.  Why this may be needed?  Well, let's say, if something very extraordinary got into the recording, and there are some individuals interested in the invisible theft of a memory card.  The registrar himself, they may not steal (this will immediately notice the owner), but they want to pull off the flash drive.  I understand that all this is far-fetched and resembles the plot of a second-rate action movie, and, nevertheless, BlackVue has this official picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/380/b56/3a8/380b563a8bac4b55bb1a44a206e59cc9.jpeg"><br><br>  However, there are chips with protection of a memory card and quite practical application - when companies with their own fleet (whether passenger or freight traffic) need to seal the slot and deprive drivers and unauthorized persons of independent unauthorized access to microSD.  Here, such a scenario sounds already goraazdo more realistic. <br><br>  There are air vents on the bottom side of the case - in this case you can't do without them, because the case of the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS is very compact (length is 116 mm, diameter is 34 mm) and the iron is very serious, otherwise it would not be possible to achieve this quality video. <br><br>  Accordingly, the active cooling of this powerful iron is necessary.  Here, on the bottom, is a microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/931/416/8be/9314168be13b4d798472d98811d14316.png"><br><br>  The holder on the windshield looks like a ring with a pad on which 3M adhesive tape is attached.  The recorder is inserted into the ring until it clicks, and is removed after pressing the button.  BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS can be rotated in a ring around its axis, aiming the autoreg on the road.  To make it convenient for the user to remember the correct position, there are several serifs on the ring. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b86/050/93d/b8605093d3414a7182197840a1703781.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/656/a77/966/656a779667d04f97a939163c5284529d.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/213/73e/f64/21373ef6432641d79fb798fca64efa12.jpeg"><br><br>  At the same time, the recorder can be turned in the ring in such a way that it looks at the salon.  This is relevant for recording a conversation with a traffic police officer who sat in the passenger seat.  But to unfold the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS sideways, to the driver's door, alas, will not work.  Well, there‚Äôs nothing to complain about, if you chose the Korean recorders, the specificity of models from this country almost never assumes any twists in the mount left or right. <br><br>  External GPS-receiver and in size, and in appearance resembles pedometers like the Xiaomi Mi Band.  Thin cable and, in general, the external design of the module allows you to easily place it where you want it, well, or where the radiotransparent area is on the heated windshield.  Well, do not forget that the external design is also good because it provides better communication with satellites - there is no interference from the inside of the recorder, as is often the case when the GPS navigation module is installed inside the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3dc/a80/9b8/3dca809b888646a18935238b9a2c5de6.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <b>We understand!</b> </h2><br>  It wasn‚Äôt that easy to pick up the Korean cylinder, but I managed to do it with the help of friends and colleagues.  By the way, when the Datakam company conducted a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/datakam/blog/252408/">comparative analysis of recorders</a> in the summer of 2015, it was the BlackVue model that turned out to be the most difficult to ‚Äúdismember‚Äù.  At the same time, it turned out that BlackVue had installed the 2012 release cards in the devices sold, but now the company has been fixed.  In the surveyed device, the "motherboards" were manufactured at the end of 2015. <br><br>  The BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS stuffing made the most pleasant impression: there were no traces of sloppy soldering, inscriptions with a marker on the board, glue leaks and other signs of the Chinese deshman here and there is no trace.  Everything is very neat - like the insides of an iPhone or Samsung top smartphones.  Please note that the RAM modules are made by Samsung - and this also suggests that the developers did not save on the components, since the RAM from the Korean manufacturer costs much more than its Chinese counterparts and differs in significantly higher quality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09a/af2/dec/09aaf2dec0944b0885070ed0082e7f47.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62c/d20/707/62cd20707e414dce81b68d25ac7da4e4.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/310/341/dbc/310341dbc60846a6b054e0ee18422982.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/078/a1b/158/078a1b1582774d16927571579fbdbfe0.jpeg"><br><br>  On the board, there is an indication of Pittasoft, the parent company of BlackVue;  This, in turn, suggests that the board is proprietary, it was not ordered from a third company.  To understand: even the Taiwanese Mio, not the last player in terms of technology player of the recorder market, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/datakam/blog/252408/">does not always</a> create the board itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30a/20e/a22/30a20ea2222642b39a9c2366121bd2d3.jpeg"><br>  <i>Mio MiVue 588 - there is no mention of the brand as a developer on the board.</i> <br><br>  In addition, please note - judging by the inscription, the motherboard is designed specifically for the BlackVue DR450-1CH, it is not some kind of universal platform for Chinese noname-developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c1/b33/445/3c1b3344582d413a8ebebe84fe6fa474.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, from the analysis of the insides of the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS, it can be concluded that, in terms of assembly, the word ‚Äúhack-work‚Äù is not familiar to South Korean specialists.  And this is not about a single case - I examined all the current models of the company and I can say with confidence that this is a whole about the high production culture in general. <br><br><h2>  <b>Functionality and settings</b> </h2><br>  BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS is configured only from a computer using the BlackVue Viewer program, which exists in the versions for Windows and macOS.  Support for the latest OS pleases, as registrar developers usually ignore it.  But from a mobile device you cannot control our registrar: there is no Wi-Fi in it, for Wi-Fi you should go to more advanced (and more expensive) BlackVue models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/301/761/ee5/301761ee5f5242ad8a74732627a4ffba.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d50/6dd/3c4/d506dd3c4403408896425a1ca5084713.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d96/dab/15e/d96dab15e7ac4f9c850b9ae8925a6100.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a1/570/8f1/0a15708f1221400181d00fd5a3cc8d9a.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1dc/192/1da/1dc1921da06e4b3db3d05acffdad0918.jpeg"><br><br>  Turn on the recorder with the inserted flash drive - and the BlackVue Viewer is copied to the media from the device's memory.  Then the flash drive can be inserted into the card reader on the PC, after which we will get access to the BlackVue Viewer.  In it you can change the following. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ select the duration of the recording in cyclic mode - 1, 2 or 3 minutes; <br>  ‚Ä¢ select the duration of the recording in the parking mode - 1, 2 or 3 minutes; <br>  ‚Ä¢ select video resolution (Full HD, 15 or 30 fps; HD, 15 or 30 fps); <br>  ‚Ä¢ adjust video brightness; <br>  ‚Ä¢ set the image quality (of course, you should choose the ‚Äúhighest‚Äù); <br>  ‚Ä¢ include date, time and user text stamps on the video; <br>  ‚Ä¢ turn on sound recording; <br>  ‚Ä¢ set automatic activation of the parking mode; <br>  ‚Ä¢ adjust the accelerometer sensitivity, including according to data from any particular video, which I personally have never seen before.  Very convenient! <br>  ‚Ä¢ customize the operation of LED indicators; <br>  ‚Ä¢ set up voice notifications; <br>  ‚Ä¢ view the video by sorting the videos by event type (normal cyclic recording, recording according to the ‚Äúinstructions‚Äù of the accelerometer, recording according to the motion sensor in the parking mode).  Viewing is possible with imposing on Google Maps - for this, in fact, you need a GPS, as well as to determine the exact time and speed. <br><br>  As mentioned above, there are three recording modes in the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS.  On a regular loop recording, you can only say that the clips are written overlap, that is, in each new video there is the last second of the old one. <br><br>  Files created in the event mode, that is, on the ‚Äúorder‚Äù of the accelerometer, include 5 seconds before the incident - impact, sudden braking, turning and so on.  Such files are placed in a special zone on the memory card and are not deleted during the cyclic rewriting. <br><br>  Well, and the third type of recording: by motion sensor, that is, when a certain object appears in the field of view of the camera in the parking mode.  There is one important nuance here: in the case of BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS, for recording in parking mode with the engine turned off, you need to purchase an accessory Power Magic Pro for 3,000 rubles, which allows you to turn on the recorder directly into the electrical system of the car.  Because there is no battery in the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS, there is only a supercapacitor, which I will discuss below. <br><br><h2>  <b>The main highlight of the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS: high quality video</b> </h2><br>  As I said at the very beginning, in the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS there are not many options that are standard for registrars of this company.  But on the video of the developers did not save a single Won.  The model uses a Sony Exmor matrix with a resolution of 2 megapixels, which is more than enough to record Full HD video.  The lens is made of professional glass with an enlightened coating and has a viewing angle of 118 degrees, that is, the standard for recorders.  There is no more information about BlackVue stuffing, which personally reminds me of Apple, which even the amount of RAM on the iPhone does not officially comment on the phone: it‚Äôs working, and it works fine, and if so, the user doesn‚Äôt need to provide any unnecessary data. <br><br>  Sample daytime shooting: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cdq4Mel8Cho" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Example of night shooting: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQ0_SBelG6Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/afd9_RbExYFXU">Original video file</a> <br><br>  Freeze frames: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/783/30c/8c0/78330c8c08074af3bb13618abcf1b0b7.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ef/f6c/de9/1eff6cde9c3649d289f72c1d685a8111.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e50/613/bfa/e50613bfa85c444ea5ca67d64f1f3e10.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/027/9c7/5d0/0279c75d0f2e4d8284ccd4244959d3c4.jpeg"><br><br>  Here and BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS perfectly writes video.  I do not like this word (‚Äúexcellent‚Äù) much in reviews, but in this case it‚Äôs not a sin to use.  Because the hero of this material provides a very clear, clear and generally beautiful picture without distortion.  And both in the afternoon, and in the dark.  The latter is especially important.  Like the same smartphones, many recorders today are able to shoot well in the light of the sun.  But with the fall in illumination intensity, serious problems begin with detailing, and with clarity, and with everything else.  However, the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS is not like this: in my opinion, it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway - day or night.  Although, of course, at night the distance of readability of numbers is smaller: not 17-20 meters, as during the day, but only 12-15.  But even this is a lot compared to even expensive (up to 15 thousand) Chinese recorders, who ‚Äúissue‚Äù 8-10 meters at night.  A third less! <br><br>  Of the minuses explained by Korean specifics, it is worth noting the lack of a BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS battery.  There is only a super-capacitor that allows you to complete the recording in case of an accident, when the recorder may lose contact with the on-board electrical system of the car.  However, the supercapacitor has one indisputable advantage: it allows you to start recording without any problems at temperatures up to minus 15 in the cold cabin of the car.  Registrars with familiar batteries in such situations often succumb until the salon ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù (which is about 10 minutes), since lithium-polymer batteries are very afraid of cold weather. <br><br><h2>  <b>Equipment</b> </h2><br>  ‚Ä¢ the recorder itself with a 3M adhesive tape; <br>  ‚Ä¢ spare sticker with 3M adhesive tape for mounting; <br>  ‚Ä¢ external GPS-module on 3M scotch tape; <br>  ‚Ä¢ power cable with a plug in the cigarette lighter; <br>  ‚Ä¢ five sites on 3M adhesive tape for neat cabling in the cabin; <br>  ‚Ä¢ attention: a special plastic lever for easy tearing-off of pads with 3M from the windshield.  A very correct accessory, since drivers often use a screwdriver to peel it off, and then they are surprised where the scratches on the glass come from; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 8 GB class 10 flash drive. Fast and good card, the volume is optimal.  It is curious that the card has the BlackVue logo, that is, it was produced directly under the company's registrars.  This is a sign of a serious approach - when a company orders the production of flash drives for its gadgets (which provides the maximum level of compatibility possible), and does not take ready-made solutions; <br>  ‚Ä¢ card reader.  A pleasant trifle, and in some cases even irreplaceable: in some modern laptops there is no memory card slot at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c83/6a2/ad7/c836a2ad7a71486a84a77e559a939e6d.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8af/e7a/5f6/8afe7a5f6eee4a56966f7ae5b973e05f.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h2><br>  What can I say?  Decent device.  Plus, by the standards of BlackVue it is not very expensive: ‚Äútotal‚Äù 13,250 rubles.  Yes, there is no Wi-Fi, which complicates the process of setting up the recorder and watching the video from it - you need to either look for a laptop / desktop, or insert a memory card into the smartphone, which is not always possible.  Yes, there are no cloud services either, as well as security systems like LDWS and alerts about speed cameras.  But do not forget that the main thing in the registrar is still video recording.  And it is here that the BlackVue DR450-1CH GPS plays out to the fullest, since it is shooting at the device level from the same BlackVue for 20 thousand rubles.  And all these Chinese with their whistles and hummers raise white flags.  In general, I sincerely recommend to all lovers of quality things who ideally perform the functions assigned to them.  You will hardly be sorry, but you will get pleasure for sure. <br><br>  <b>PS I</b> remind you - on the choice of registrars or other points on this subject feel free to contact me personally at schub.alexandr@yandex.ru. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372947/</a></p>
