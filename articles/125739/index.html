All this, of course, not to mention the high degree of scalability, which already today is creating an Internet-oriented economy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The IBM Smart Business family has several solutions for companies of different levels, occupations and sizes.  Regardless of whether you need to create your own cloud environment behind a firewall or access the cloud on the IBM platform or use teamwork tools, IBM already has ready-made solutions for developing / creating products or upgrading infrastructure.

      Specifically, IBM has several services that may seem useful to people who are not yet using cloud technologies in their own companies and enterprises.  For example, Test Cloud provides a convenient environment for testing applications in a secure cloud environment within the corporate perimeter.  Development and Test provides convenient access to scalable technical resources for rapid and efficient development and subsequent testing.  Finally, the Desktop Cloud is a high-standard, fault-tolerant and secure desktop environment that runs behind the customer‚Äôs firewall (inside the company) or on the IBM platform. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d9/934/cd1/8d9934cd17d0c86311d2ca52b68c837f.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The benefits of using such systems are a great many - the rapid scaling of the entire IT infrastructure of the company to meet the changing needs of the business, and lowering the total cost of ownership of the infrastructure, increasing operational flexibility, reducing electricity costs, variable pricing, etc.  It is unlikely that anyone else considered the possibility of building a computer network based on the cloud, in fact, without having computing resources in the office. <br><br>  Needless to say about the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ru/lotus/">Lotus</a> family of products that have already earned their respect among IT professionals.  Today's LotusLive can also be cloudy, providing out of the box world-class social networking services as well as online collaboration tools: file sharing, conferencing, and instant messaging based on an Internet browser. <br><br>  But apart from that, it now appeared with LotusLive iNotes, a security featured, cloud service designed to perform functions such as email, scheduling, and contact management.  The introduction of such a product helps to reduce costs and overcome the limitations associated with supporting corporate policies and rules in the field of email. <br><br>  Finally, for medium and large businesses, IBM provides high-end infrastructure services.  <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/hardware/cod/">CoD</a> (Computing on Demand) is the use of IBM cluster resources (System x, BladeCenter, Power Systems, and Storage) under the classical hourly, weekly, or annual rent.  It is a flexible computing infrastructure with the best payment method in the cloud. <br><br>  <a href="http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/en/it-services/business-continuity-and-resiliency-services.html">Business Continuity and Resiliency Services</a> are tools for assessing the reliability and sustainability of business processes of any company or supplier that provides applications or services.  The use of such a ‚Äúbarometer‚Äù will help to optimize internal systems for improving the fault tolerance parameters. <br><br>  And, of course, a cloud cannot be good if there are no backups in it - so IBM developed the <a href="http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/en/it-services/remote-data-protection.html">BCRS Information Protection Services system</a> , which is essentially a separate automatic cloud backup and data recovery service for personal computers and notebooks of the company. <br><br>  IBM not only provides its services and products to individual companies, but also helps other innovators in the region to expand their influence, improving the quality of services of other companies.  After all, if one head is good, then two is even better! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MlZl3juTaWE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhitTUuRte3xer-2pTlCmvBqre89mg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125739/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125739/</a></p>
