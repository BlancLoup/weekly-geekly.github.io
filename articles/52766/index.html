  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Really working resources available to software entrepreneurs in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We often hear that, they say, if an entrepreneur needs support, it means that he is a bad entrepreneur. <br>  Working in Russian Microsoft and working on projects to support technology entrepreneurship, I communicate with many entrepreneurs, including those who have achieved a lot and have received universal recognition.  And I clearly see that they are distinguished first of all by the fact that they never miss a single chance to get <strong>everything</strong> that can help their business. <br>  Therefore, I decided to publish a topic on <strong>what resources / programs currently available on the Russian market can _realically_ make life easier for a software startup</strong> .  I will describe those that are known to me (both provided by Microsoft and our partners, and not related to Microsoft).  And the community, I hope, will add. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, <br>  1. <strong>BizSpark</strong> program for individuals and companies planning to earn or already earning on their own software development.  Including shareware developers.  Including those who do not use the Microsoft platform for development;) <br>  Description: <a href="http://www.ms-start.ru/programs/bizspark.aspx">www.ms-start.ru/programs/bizspark.aspx</a> <br>  A podcast from WebMasterRadio ‚Äúa story in human language, why Microsoft needs it‚Äù: <a href="http://wmradio.ru/broadcast/68/71/130">wmradio.ru/broadcast/68/71/130</a> <br>  What does BizSpark consist of: <br>  - <strong>ALL Microsoft software</strong> for development and server software for commercial hosting of Internet services is practically <strong>free</strong> .  Nothing like this has ever been close! <br>  - Visibility in the international market (for those who need it) <br>  <strong>Partner offers (examples)</strong> : <br>  - Parking.ru: Discount 20% on the rental of a virtual dedicated server on Hyper-V <br>  - Softline, Softkey, Interface: decent discounts on software, consulting, training.  What is important: the provision of their sales channels.  Softline also has investments. <br>  - Commonwealth of Business Angels of Russia (russba.ru): 50% discount on participation in their paid events (conferences, forums, seminars, trainings), free advice on how to attract investments in the project, actually help in attracting investments <br>  - Masterhost: 5% discount for rental and server hosting services, as well as virtual dedicated server services <br>  - Trinity Technopark: investments, incubation, consulting <br>  - AddVenture: investment $ 20-50K + placement on the platform + coaching <br>  etc.  (seychs just gaining new projects) <br>  (To avoid ambiguity, I will immediately say that some offers from partners are valid (not only for BizSpark participants.) <br><br>  On Habr√© on the topic BizSpark wrote a lot and answered questions on the Microsoft blog.  For example, here <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/microsoft/49867/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/microsoft/49867</a> <br>  There was also a discussion on <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.ru/personal/beerbong/CommentView.aspx%3Fguid%3D465c1c0d-32b9-4e85-8166-108243989ca9">blogs.gotdotnet.ru/personal/beerbong/CommentView.aspx?guid=465c1c0d-32b9-4e85-8166-108243989ca9</a> <br><br>  Registering is not easy, but very simple.  Registration through Partners does not impose <strong>any</strong> additional obligations on the participant, so it makes direct sense to write them about yourself and request a registration code.  If, for some strange reason, you still want to do it directly through Microsoft, write to me or rustust@microsoft.com - I will send the code.

      2. <strong>Microsoft Business Start</strong> .  A real opportunity to get for 3 years of state.  a grant from the Assistance Foundation in the amount of 6M rubles.  under certain conditions. <br>  <a href="http://www.ms-start.ru/Programs/Start.aspx">www.ms-start.ru/Programs/Start.aspx</a> <br><br>  Over the past 2 years, 34 projects have received funding.  This year right now we are examining as many as 128 applications.  Alas, there are few projects with real commercial prospects!  :( And, alas, the next round starts only this fall. <br><br>  3. <strong>"Start in the garage</strong> . <strong>"</strong>  A unique training in software entrepreneurship from the ABT venture fund with the support of Microsoft. <br>  <a href="http://www.startingarage.com/">www.startingarage.com</a> <br><br>  There is nothing of the kind not only in Russia, but also, it seems, in Europe!  Read feedback from participants.  And about 250 people attended the training. <br>  The nearest dates in Moscow: April 17-25 <br>  Not cheap. <br>  However, Microsoft partners have a discount of about 50%, and the winners of Microsoft Business Start are free of charge. <br>  And, in general, the organizers are quite flexible;) <br><br>  4. <strong>IT Alliance</strong> (Commonwealth of Business Angels of Russia + Intel + Microsoft + Russian Venture Funds). <br>  Preparation of projects to the stage of investment attractiveness and assistance in attracting investment. <br>  <a href="http://www.russba.ru/it_alliance/">www.russba.ru/it_alliance</a> <br><br>  Projects are taken into work at an early stage and are prepared for several months using a special technology. <br>  Look at the next public presentation session (where projects that have been prepared, present their business plans to investors) will be available at the Moscow Venture Forum (http://www.arip.ru/default2.aspx?s=0&amp;p=349) June 17-18. <br><br>  Apply with your project here: <br>  <a href="http://www.russba.ru/innovator-add/">www.russba.ru/innovator-add</a> <br><br>  5. For students - the competition "software projects" in the framework of <strong>ImagineCup</strong> (www.imaginecup.ru), and then the opportunity to get 200 Krub per year for 2 years under the program <strong>U.M.NIK to the</strong> previously mentioned Assistance Foundation (www.fasie .ru) <br><br>  6. <strong>Business incubators</strong> that accept residents: <br>  SPb Technopark (under Bonch-Bruyevich) - just starting <br>  Technopark Strogino (although their management has changed, I don‚Äôt really know how the process is going) <br>  Trinity Technopark - wrote above <br>  Technopark of the Novosibirsk Academgorodok are also partners of BizSpark <br>  Technopark IDEA, Kazan - they are happy, rather, already more or less mature resident companies <br><br>  7. Department of small business support in Moscow. <br>  <strong>Subsidies</strong> for participation in specialized events to promote products, patent and licensing work, branding and protection of intellectual property.  That is, you invest your money, and Moscow adds to you from 30 to 70% depending on the specific program.  They say it works.  Who checked, respond? <br>  <a href="http://www.arip.ru/">www.arip.ru</a> <br><br><pre>  -------------------------------------------------- ------------------- </pre><br><br>  Surely forgot something.  And about something not heard.  Complete! <br><br>  And further.  If you are developing a commercial software and clearly understand that among all the proposals there is not something essential <strong>specifically</strong> for you, also write and maybe it will appear after a while. <br>  We and our partners need feedback. <br>  After all, 2.5 years ago, the overwhelming majority (if not all) of the programs described above <strong>simply did not exist!</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52766/</a></p>
