  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to lead SMM in 2019: 17 charts from Neil Patel</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It‚Äôs hard to get traffic from social networks if you don‚Äôt spend money on advertising.  The average number of shareings dies year after year.  However, we cannot ignore Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube or any new social network, which is gaining momentum, because they just have huge traffic.  How to get back organic reach and boost sales, says Neil Patel, one of the best marketers in the world, in the column ‚Äú <i>17 Charts That Shows Social Media is Heading</i> .‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Facebook is <a href="">visited</a> monthly <a href="">by</a> 19 billion people.  According to Similar Web, other platforms have monthly traffic like this: <br><br><ul><li>  LinkedIn - 917 million; </li><li>  Twitter - 3.62 billion; </li><li>  YouTube - 22.77 billion; </li><li>  Pinterest - 722 million; </li><li>  Instagram - 2.86 billion </li></ul><br>  It turns out that we like their algorithms or not, we simply have no choice but to be in these social networks, because they attract just tons of traffic. <br><br>  But what should we do with organic coverage in social networks?  How to deal with algorithms to generate profits, because advertising prices continue to grow?

      Neil Patel surveyed 183 companies with annual revenues from $ 5 million to $ 1.7 billion to show where social networks are moving and how we can succeed in moving to them. <br><br><h2>  Expect less traffic from the social network, even if you pay for it </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60a/11b/365/60a11b365e9368c60afd30bebfab7bdd.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Average number of reposts</i> <br><br>  Since 2015, the number of rassharivany decreases.  Social networks specifically reduce their organic reach so that companies pay for the amount of traffic they are used to and hoped for. <br><br>  Now let's look at the share of advertising in social networks in the total volume of Internet advertising.  It has been growing significantly since 2016.  For example, on Facebook in mid-2017 there were so many advertisers that CPM and CPC bids rose significantly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd4/baa/a98/cd4baaa989b75b2bdf9ef98cf7c26c88.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>The share of advertising in social networks in the total volume of Internet advertising</i> <br><br>  But just like in the case of SEO, marketers figured out how to return the dying smm traffic.  Since 2017, organic traffic is gradually increasing.  Of course, it will not last forever, but so far there is a chance.  Have you guessed how they did it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f76/cdc/6b8/f76cdc6b81fddc39cc682b43cd136cc7.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Organic traffic share</i> <br><br><h2>  Do not expect help from employees </h2><br>  Almost 75% of surveyed companies ask employees to share their content in order to get likes and comments.  Neil Patel did that, too, but it's a bad way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/004/c9d/822/004c9d822cb24401e9d5399f74c88ebf.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Are you asking employees to respond to content on social networks?</i> <br><br>  Then Neil stopped because he realized that no one wants to share the content of the employer.  In other companies, too.  The first couple of times employees agree, but when it becomes a regular practice, they simply ignore such requests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/215/0df/550/2150df5502a344a6f9479745108fd7c8.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Do employees share your content in social networks?</i> <br><br><h2>  You need to do chat bot </h2><br>  Companies spend on creating each type of content at different times.  Here is how it is distributed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f4/1fc/11b/8f41fc11b014fc003cd4ad6efab4f83e.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>What percentage of the time you spend on creating different types of content?</i> <br><br>  Everyone loves to post images and text, because they are easy to prepare.  But these formats do not bring high involvement.  It is better to do live video broadcasts and just videos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b17/d77/928/b17d7792868a67169e8fe718a76fe423.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>What formats bring maximum engagement?</i> <br><br>  Social networks are trying to compete with television or online platforms like Netflix.  To get the maximum engagement, shoot the video.  Ideally - live, but the records also fit.  They will bring new subscribers and will be accurately viewed, unlike pictures and text.  Another reason in favor of video clips is keeping visitors in social networks, rather than redirecting them to the company's website, so the video gets more organic content.  And to get users to the site, use chat bots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6a/340/5e1/a6a3405e17bf52e85010683c3926c92c.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>What brings you the most organic traffic?</i> <br><br>  More than 40% of companies received traffic thanks to chat bots.  To get people out of social networks, for example, Facebook, get a bot in the messenger - <a href="https://mobilemonkey.com/">Mobile Monkey</a> or others.  Messengers are very effective.  So far, not every social network they are, but Neil suggests that soon everything will change. <br><br><h2>  It is necessary to start a global expansion </h2><br>  Both sites and smm should be global.  The number of non-English-speaking visitors is growing, so it's time to think about creating multilingual content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/034/69b/819/03469b81926ff9c0d31e92ec7f99ad7b.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Share of SMM traffic from English speaking countries</i> <br><br>  Many have already noticed the trend and publish content in other languages: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/67e/774/ae5/67e774ae5590d7237682fa0d90bfe8b7.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>How many languages ‚Äã‚Äãdo you publish content?</i> <i><br></i> <br>  This trend will only intensify, because SMM in non-English speaking countries is more profitable.  To get the most out of SMM traffic and advertising, post content in multiple languages.  For example, in Facebook, you can target by region, although Twitter and Instagram are not yet. <br><br>  Advertising is expensive in the USA, Japan, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, but in the countries of Latin America and Asia it is cheap. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bcc/15b/b56/bcc15bb56eab627676c2109ea8a70461.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Ways to increase SMM revenue </h2><br>  Just as in content marketing, do not expect instant conversion of visitors.  On average, traffic from social networks is converted after three visits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61f/cbf/9de/61fcbf9de5bb3bdd58ff9ed18d1311e6.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>The average number of visits from social networks before the user becomes a customer</i> <br><br>  If sales are needed, then we must try to get people back.  This is a long game.  The easiest way to turn visitors into customers is to set up remarketing.  However, there are other solutions that few people use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/284/91f/7ec/28491f7ec0ebe6ecb758648e20a9890e.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>How do you convert a visitor from social networks into a buyer?</i> <br><br>  It is best to combine the channels, because one will not be enough.  And be sure to turn on sms.  Neil suggests that few people use sms marketing.  But 68% of recipients respond to his SMS distribution.  If you think that this is a lot, then Neil adds that this is not the share of those who opened the message, but the share of those who responded to it! <br><br>  Neil advises increasing conversions with tools: <a href="https://hellobar.com/">Hello Bar</a> - for email and <a href="https://subscribers.com/">Subscribers</a> - for push notifications <br><br>  There are several ways to increase sales through social networks - chat bots and videos.  Of course, simply updating the status is easier than shooting videos, but algorithms prefer them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d4/150/e46/0d4150e46e4add7d1598bdeb13581d07.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>What is the share of organic traffic for each type of content?</i> <br><br><h2>  Focus on specific social networks to boost sales. </h2><br>  Sales has a complex formula.  To get the full picture, see where and how the first and last touch of your clients takes place.  The first touch will show how potential customers find you.  They do not buy immediately, but this is the point at which they learn about the company and its product.  The surveyed companies are leading Facebook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3cc/a24/598/3cca24598858c12445789cebfef4bc70.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>In which social network does the first contact most often occur?</i> <br><br>  The place of the last touch before the purchase is different from the first, but Facebook is still the leader.  However, YouTube is in second place and WhatsApp is in third.  This is not surprising, because text messages have a high share of openings and clicks, so consider <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api">whether you can work</a> through WhatsApp too. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c43/cb0/c18/c43cb0c181aa08ee4b5d772115043b4a.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>In which social network does the last touch most often occur before purchase?</i> <br><br>  YouTube and WhatsApp are excellent channels for closing a deal, but so far there are few companies that use them: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/59a/0b1/8f2/59a0b18f20dbe122e7f303dd591c4629.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>What social network benefits your company?</i> <br><br><h2>  so </h2><br>  The algorithms for both organic coverage and advertising will become even tougher, and companies constantly face social networking issues with fake news, confidentiality and politics.  But this does not mean that it is necessary to abandon the SMM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/414/fa1/290/414fa1290edae9ef7e63e0a4ca2ffcf8.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>What percentage of customers know about you on social networks?</i> <br><br>  Facts say that social networks are on the rise.  They no longer grow quickly, but this is only because most users are already registered with them.  Social networks are effective because people trust their information.  And confidence will only increase as you solve problems fake news and the like. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446644/</a></p>
