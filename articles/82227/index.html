On various topics, a sort of PR digest :) <br><br>  <b>Fourth Nomobile get-together</b> <br>  First, I want to invite all the habra people living in Moscow to tomorrow's party, Nomobile.ru, which will be held in the Friday bar on Pyatnitskaya Street.  The site Nomobile.ru practices monthly meetings with readers, during which the editors get acquainted with their audience (it is always very important to see the "live" person for whom you write), and readers can chat with the Nomobile.ru team, ask questions and have a drink in an informal setting :).  We call this the ‚ÄúNomobile.ru club meeting,‚Äù and besides just communication there is always some kind of action.  They are usually held in conjunction with brands.  So, at the first such event, Nomobile.ru was visited by Nokia, whose representatives showed their Maemo-von N900 to friends and readers of Nomobile.ru.  And it happened a week before the start of sales of the device, so that the readers of Nomobile.ru had a kind of exclusive.  By the way, the presentation took place directly from the phone, a video report from this event can be <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/video/54407.html">viewed here</a> .  At the second event, the guest of Nomobile.ru was the HTC company, which showed its HD2 smartphone, he received the title ‚ÄúProduct of the Year‚Äù on Nomobile.ru.  HD2 readers of Nomobile.ru also saw before the start of sales of the smartphone, <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/video/56794.html">that's how it was</a> .

So, just before the new year, the Nerobile.ru get-together took place on the Xbox Guitar Hero tournament, with gamers cutting themselves against professional, ‚Äúlive‚Äù musicians who saw plastic guitars for the first time.  To our surprise, in a dramatic struggle, the musicians won, taking the lead in the final round of 5 (final score 3: 2).  You can see how this happened in the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/nomobile_team/14212.html">photo report</a> , on the video <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/video/60432.html">here</a> or in the report of <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xbooef_yyyyy-yy-29-yyyyyyy-2009_shortfilms">the First Game Channel</a> .  And tomorrow, the day of racing lovers will happen - the best virtual racers in the game Forza Motorsport 3 will compete in the same Friday bar, as well as famous racers who have never played this game before.  Come!  Address and details of the event <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/konkurs/60929.html">here</a> .  By the way, one of the following parties is planned in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  <b>Apple iPad</b> <br>  Probably, not everyone knows that just recently, for the first time in the history of Apple Russia, the Russian representative office of Apple had a PR manager (before that, the company had always worked through an agency). <a name="habracut"></a>  They became my old friend Irina Efremova, who had previously worked well at HP, as well as at Kaspersky Lab.  When I learned that Ira became a press manager, I was glad to have the opportunity to receive comments on any occasion :), but unfortunately, Apple‚Äôs policy has not changed: there are only a few people in Europe (as before, there are only a few people). "), Which you can give comments in public, and then with a bunch of restrictions. <br><br><img src="http://www.nomobile.ru/upload/iblock/8e5/apple-come645.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And I rushed to Ira, of course, about the announcement of the tablet, which is about to take place.  But, despite the fact that there will be no official reaction and answers to questions that will certainly appear after the announcement, the Nomobile.ru team will not leave work today :) until it has completed this event.  I did not force them, they themselves :).  The main page of nomobile.ru, <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/texts/61333.html">here</a> , will be a direct, so to speak, text broadcast :) about impressions of the new Apple product. <br><br>  <b>HP Envy 15 Laptop</b> <br>  After the news about Apple: a great resonance <s>in Hewlett-Packard</s> on the site caused a devastating review of the HP Envy 15 laptop, according to the author of Nomobile.ru, who simply clones Apple products.  The review begins with these words: ‚ÄúThough cut me off - I do not understand how marketers of Hewlett Packard managed to prevent such a puncture.  To name a line of laptops, the design of which is about eighty percent copied from the Apple MacBook, so unequivocally - ‚ÄúEnvy‚Äù ... The result is a score of 3 plus and under 50 comments.  <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/reviews/61042.html">Read here.</a> <br><br><img src="http://www.nomobile.ru/upload/iblock/3dd/02.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Test drive Panasonic GF1</b> <br>  We have already raised the topic of 4/3 cameras more than once (Aleshka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/goncharow/" class="user_link">goncharow</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DSLR/81983/">showed the macro capabilities of the Panasonic GF1</a> ), and now - a video report with a test drive of the Panasonic GF1.  In addition to the editor of Nomobile.ru, Evgeny Kozlovsky and Sergey Malenkovich shared their views on the product, there is also a comment from Panasonic Product Manager Dmitry Smolyankin.  <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/video/61389.html">Watch the video here</a> <br><br><img src="http://www.panasonic.com.sg/web/imgPrd/8436/DMC-GF1CGC-R_wbA1001001A09H18B75255H87997.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Sony Ericsson Vivaz</b> <br>  In addition to fotik, Alexey Goncharov also tested the Sony Ericsson Vivaz smartphone, which was rated four nomobile-points.  ‚ÄúRelease his SE at least at the end of the summer - in all the results of 2009 they would write about the company much warmer.  But the Sony Ericsson U5i Vivaz is coming out just now.  Is the spoon late for dinner? ‚Äú <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/reviews/61042.html">Read here</a> <br><br><img src="http://www.nomobile.ru/upload/images/60747/09_645.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>WD TV Live</b> <br>  And the last.  I've been testing WD TV Live media player for more than a month now - for my taste, this is the best media player on the market.  I have already submitted his review to Itogi magazine and am preparing for Nomobile.ru.  Since the topic of media players in Habr√© is always relevant, and specifically for Live there is little information here, I appeal to those who want to buy this player - are there any questions? <br><br><img src="http://www.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/wdfWDTV_Live-hdd-620x487.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I can drive on specific formats, take test shots, pay attention to some nuances.
