  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Features of winter fishing with echo sounder</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The echo sounder is a portable device that functions via Bluetooth.  The device is quite interesting, and not only the ability to work through a smartphone.  He knows how to scan fish shoals and the bottom of reservoirs.  To work with it, you will need a smartphone or tablet running iOS or Android.  In terms of efficiency ‚Äî display accuracy and the ability to see under water ‚Äî it is not inferior to a three-beam echo sounder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b10/2d3/a1d/b102d3a1d7954d93889134d365ffc705.jpg"><br><br>  The box is completely ordinary.  It shows the key parameters of the device and provides brief instructions on working with the application on a mobile phone.  The kit includes directly echo sounder, detailed instructions, a case with a carabiner and a stand playing the role of a base for charging, USB 2.0.  The manual has a section in Russian.  On the device itself around the perimeter there are convex points intended for installation on the base and charging. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07a/431/1a8/07a4311a801840b589da15938e844c6f.jpg"><br><br>  We have already given <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/284508/">one review</a> , but it was not entirely informative, this article compensates for this shortcoming. <br><br>  These points need to accurately fit into the grooves on the base, and then turn clockwise.  The device itself is made very high quality, however, despite its compactness, it weighs a lot.  Apparently, the heavy echo sounder was made intentionally to ensure the possibility of throwing at long distances.  The radius of the Bluetooth signal coverage is 30 m. <br><br>  Purpose: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ shore fishing <br>  ‚Ä¢ fishing from a boat <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08a/0b6/125/08a0b612565c4580a8b19604b67368ad.jpg"><br><br>  The wireless Reelsonar iBobber Fishfinder is capable of playing the role of a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù sonar and can be connected to a smartphone or tablet.  To do this, you need Bluetooth and a mobile device running the Android OS or iOS.  On the display, the echo sounder will show the outlines of the bottom of the reservoir, as well as display the current water temperature, weather report and the phase of the moon.  After it is cast into the water, the device automatically activates and instantly starts sending via Bluetooth information about the depth, water temperature and presence of fish, synchronizing with the gadget and outputting information in a specialized application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07c/e33/71c/07ce3371cbcc4602a94cbaf69f4f19f6.jpg"><br><br>  Components emitting 2 types of beams are integrated into the sonar.  A narrow beam allows you to analyze the shape and depth of the bottom.  Reflected waves are caught by the device and converted into a picture.  The echo sounder detector sets the exact temperature.  To display the weather and phases of the moon, you will need to connect to the Internet via a mobile device. <br><br>  Download the iBobber app from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.reelsonar.ibobber%26hl%3Dru">Google Play</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibobber/id794673333">iTunes</a> .  Install on smartphone, tablet and register.  Next we are greeted with a small introduction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a63/682/0c9/a636820c9cdc489e89015d5952ebebac.jpg"><br><br>  Read or skip.  Everything is clear and clear.  The echo sounder is connected to the smartphone via bluetooth.  Code 1234 or 0000 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/472/64a/27f/47264a27ffb440f3832ce775b66c6692.jpg"><br><br>  So, I was wondering how the echo sounder would behave during the winter fishing.  The hole is ready and it's time to throw the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d5/3f1/d35/4d53f1d35b65473b8be03993fce9800c.jpg"><br><br>  As soon as the echo sounder is in the water, it immediately turns on and now it can be found among bluetooth devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d5/3ba/bc4/0d53babc44d742b0a8e8c77cac196d75.jpg"><br><br>  Functional: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to find more fish thanks to the sonar with a 45-meter depth and coverage up to 75 m. Of all the analogues on the market, this echo sounder provides the largest coverage angle of 42 ¬∞. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to choose between ordinary locator mode and fishing mode. <br>  ‚Ä¢ To view the contours of the bottom, it is enough to throw the echo sounder into the water, click on ‚Äústart‚Äù, wait for 3 seconds and circle the area with an instrument that interests you.  Then you need to click on the "stop" and see the displayed map. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Keeping in mind the location, date, exact time and conditions of fishing - water temperature, type of fishing and the selected bait, as well as the number, variety and photos of fish caught. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Hanging pictures of the catch in social networks. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Determine your own location with GPS support and memorize a catchy place, then go fishing there again. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fishing at twilight and after sunset thanks to integrated LED lighting. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Weather has a significant effect on bite intensity.  Plan your fishing, based on weather forecasts, atmospheric pressure and the possibility of precipitation. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Alert using highly sensitive alarm when biting or testing fish bait. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Instant notification when a fish approaches, displaying information about its approximate dimensions and depth. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The program calendar shows the time of sunrise and sunset, moon phases, and in addition, the schedule of tides. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c9/548/99a/8c954899a2984246a868be0af524bb6a.jpg"><br><br>  An orange icon indicates that the echo sounder has been connected and has already started scanning.  Next, I will show screenshots from the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e12/3c2/5cd/e123c25cd4714b44b5aefe9274dc9b9f.jpg"><br><br>  The echo sounder can operate as anti-glare and as usual.  Clicking on the fish icon shows the device operation in the mode ‚Äúfish display in real time echo sounder‚Äù or in the size mode ‚Äúsymbols in the form of fish". <br><br>  One has only to swim the fish and he will immediately show it on the screen.  Orange color indicates fish up to 40 cm. A light green label indicates fish more than 40 cm. Also, there is a bite mode, when the echo sounder plays the role of a beacon.  The fishing line jerking the echo sounder, will give him a signal about the bite.  Further, the warning will be reflected on the smartphone.  On the sonar screen, there is water temperature, battery charge, a sound signal about a passing object, a vole sound signal and lights at night. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c7/e4d/40c/0c7e4d40c5bb4d4c89c2a3ef09d484fd.jpg"><br><br>  Pressing the bottom map icon will show the relief on the sonar screen.  For a full picture, you need to drive an echo sounder around the area.  In winter fishing the width of the hole is 1 meter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79a/f8e/f5c/79af8ef5ccfb49de8fbd441cf6e2c84b.jpg"><br><br>  The echo sounder floats on the water like a buoy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c72/49e/da9/c7249eda9c6140e49f7cf0511b1cbb49.jpg"><br><br>  Throw and look for fish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a2/17d/fa6/3a217dfa6ef04ce8a67128aef5bb5337.jpg"><br><br>  On the Six Farm are weak bite.  The fish went badly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52d/0a6/16a/52d0a616a38b44a6b3293aea29f1159d.jpg"><br><br>  Something certainly floated and then disappeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b68/2bf/3a8/b682bf3a83364fb3bcd296edd8932d55.jpg"><br><br>  I managed to catch such perch here.  In general, the echo sounder saved a lot of time.  Where there is no fish, he was silent.  You can go to another place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd0/856/ecc/dd0856ecc8fb4c94a9c5f09991c2c50c.jpg"><br><br>  Those who sat without appliances, did not catch anything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ad/31d/75c/7ad31d75c21e46fc9ec0f1253d8d9655.jpg"><br><br>  The fish is now some kind of sleepy or all the sportsmen fished before us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/525/ed2/2da/525ed22da27143cead98feef714e7431.jpg"><br><br>  Someone of course comes here for a few days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a70/20c/25f/a7020c25fcc7448196654215700e4139.jpg"><br><br>  And combing every meter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f86/f38/d2d/f86f38d2df9547d980b0d68dfeac31b6.jpg"><br><br>  Fisherman on the background of the mountain Beshtau.  It's probably an hour already.  There is no fish there!  Not.  We know exactly where it floats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d08/0cc/3a0/d080cc3a0a1d476e9a900be686d5b0c4.jpg"><br><br>  And here, where there are tents - all silence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18c/c07/3e8/18cc073e88c4496dba9576f79c2e36b9.jpg"><br><br>  But on the first hole there was a movement and, as a result, a small catch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c7/8f2/b5c/1c78f2b5cb0f45cea17b69bae9e6cce8.jpg"><br><br>  Six Farm and a lake near it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f36/f64/1ea/f36f641ea9654c7095512ef0c1296c17.jpg"><br><br>  On the advice of experienced, caught on the moth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c9/3ce/18b/7c93ce18bfec42ff86f8b66925edc8dd.jpg"><br><br>  Juicy, thick. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f0/4dd/6f7/1f04dd6f782347108543cb2831dc4e8b.jpg"><br><br>  Next weekend we want to check the presence of fish in another pond. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/756/d8f/896/756d8f89672f4a38bf83da47a0a640e7.jpg"><br><br>  And what if you're lucky? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97e/fb5/b63/97efb5b637a440cbbb1ab3aeea2cf1de.jpg"><br><br>  All the following 10 holes - the echo sounder was silent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7bf/5a6/b2c/7bf5a6b2c72d45539dfc6a7ece10ad3e.jpg"><br><br>  And only at the last flashed one fish and disappeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/443/a49/ce5/443a49ce539448fbbeedf0330267a0af.jpg"><br><br>  It's time to get ready, the fish are definitely not here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be3/201/8f9/be32018f9cfd46cba2ef0eec45dd0a46.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/zdorove/bluetooth-eholot-dlja-smartphone-ibobber/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dbluetooth-eholot-dlja-smartphone-ibobber%26utm_content%3Dbluetooth-eholot-dlja-smartphone-ibobber%26utm_campaign%3Dbluetooth-eholot-dlja-smartphone-ibobber_506">echo sounder</a> showed itself positively, it allowed not to linger at the empty holes and move on to the next one.
