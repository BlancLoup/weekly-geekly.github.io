This is perhaps one of the most conservative professions.  It is always connected with pieces of paper, pieces of paper and the sea, and they lie flat on my desk in a flat stack, huddled in folders for A4 format.  The worst thing is that it is undesirable to throw them out or destroy them, according to the law, meanness the next day will be VERY needed. <br><br>  Accordingly, the profession imposes a number of interesting needs.  For example, extensive work with the text.  In this case, the text can be anywhere.  For example: <br><br>  You sit reading the practice of the court, you see an interesting interpretation of the article, you think that you are guaranteed to be useful in bookmarks.  After N time, you remember, you start to search, to think in which chrome profile you saved it, you find, you see, a text wrapper ... it takes a lot of time.  Plus, not everything that I needed can be saved in the browser. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  In general, I have two working tools: a stationary computer, where 100500 tabs are always open in chrome, the legal system and a word processor and a netbook with ION are running, which can work for 6 hours and show HD.  Evernote and dropbox allow not to bother with throwing documents, punctuality is monitored by guglokalandar.  But something was missing for me.  In the dropbok, I have a teksovy file "in the manner of nonsense" in which I threw out unformed wash, and I wanted to develop this idea.  For a long time I tried to teach myself to use todo managers, but without success, but all these efforts resulted in another ‚Äúdo‚Äù file in which tasks for the day were set.  However, then there were two files: "work", "personal".  I did not like switching between files, so I decided to find an alternative to the standard notebook.  Vicki threw a couple of programs, some of them needed to be installed, some were too large, I stopped at the Notepad ++ minimalist package. <br>  Everything suited me, but somehow I was groping in search of new ‚Äúnon-dull‚Äù wallpapers on deviantart and I came across a certain Tempad - Temporary Notes Editor <br>  I was most attracted by the image of the program
