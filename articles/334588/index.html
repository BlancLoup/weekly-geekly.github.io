Retargeting and what it is eaten with.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that between the first and second day of the promised cycle about online marketing, there was a hole in 66 days.  But we will leave it on the conscience of an incredible bitcoin jump, because of which my hands were sweating with excitement and even more incredible auction of generosity from Apple, which decided to arrange an exchange of 15 inch Macbook Pro 2012 for 2015/2016 and even 2017 models.  And despite the fact that right now I am actively engaged in preparing for the launch of three new online projects, I promise that the following publications will be published much more often. <br><br>  For now - let's leave the lyrical digression, and move on to the cut, where we will talk closely about retargeting.  Or rather, how the generalized majority of Internet entrepreneurs lose money out of the blue! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29e/71d/b25/29e71db25828492b36747b2bdd7658b8.jpg" alt="image"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I am 100 percent sure that almost every one of you at least once in my life has come across a retargeting pixel;  active Internet users interact with them several times a day.  You may have noticed how <b>after visiting a certain site</b> on your social networks, on any forums, other sites, or even directly on Google or Yandex, ads appear directly related to the site, product or service You only saw a couple of days, and maybe a couple of minutes ago.  Of course, the audience of this site is inclined to believe that such techniques (a completely white and legal instrument) are the work of the devil, which nevriyeratno harm the user.  However, the numbers say the opposite.  Think about it, are users really stupid enough to make purchases that harm them with enviable regularity?

      This is a great advertisement that you simply set up once to get incredible results on an ongoing basis.  And it's not about intrusive advertising, as programmers will argue, but in conventional psychology, which claims that in order to make a purchase, you need to contact a potential client from 6 to (there can be any number here) times.  Agree, it is foolish to lose the opportunity to once again remind the user who visited your website just a few days ago in search of plastic windows.  Especially when the cost of a retargeting click is several times (usually tens) times lower than the cost of a click from contextual advertising. <br><br>  But let's get everything in order! <br><br><h2>  What is retargeting? </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06c/bb3/146/06cbb3146026f69a438f0695142bf221.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Retargeting pixel is a small script that allows you to save information about users who came to your website, regardless of whether they came from search or social systems, paid advertising, or any other source of traffic. <br><br>  From a technical point of view, it looks something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb1/24e/ace/bb124eacee2aa5f942c600b2e499ff53.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to this code, every person who has visited your site at least once is automatically sent to the appropriate database.  For example, if it is a pixel from VKontakte or Facebook, it is sent to the advertising office of a social network, giving you the opportunity to advertise to hotter users who have already met your site / product or service, and maybe they did certain things - for example, they went to the shopping cart page, but they didn‚Äôt manage to make a purchase. <br><br><h3>  But why do I need it? </h3><br>  What is achieved with this tool?  Everything is very simple: if you look at the average user, the person who has only recently interacted with your website or landing page is much more inclined to purchase.  Ideally, you can build a so-called (be this expression wrong) sales funnel, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/191/eab/a49/191eaba49d84743d656707a3e9e209d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  thanks to which you will have the opportunity to take the user through a whole series of pages, constantly opening for him new ‚Äúportions‚Äù of information, whose goal is to fight objections / familiarity with the product or service / offer of Apsella, which I mentioned <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/329516/">in the last article</a> , or something something else. <br><br>  Thanks to retargeting, you can also <b>actively promote sales</b> .  For example, if the person who made the order and transferred to the cart did not make a purchase for any reason, you can always try to encourage him to return with the help of some eye-catching ads, which may also contain information about an additional discount or gift box. <br><br><h3>  But what happens in practice? </h3><br>  Recently, I analyzed the service station landings, which were at the first positions in contextual advertising from Google on request: installing windows in Moscow, installing video surveillance, repairing laptops, clothes for pregnant women, repairing apartments in Moscow and organizing events in Moscow.  A completely unrepresentative and small sample (as a statistician tells you), nevertheless, I was so amazed that I decided to stop in order not to get even more upset.  Of the above landing pages, only 12 are set for the retargeting pixel VK and 10 for the Tag manager from Google (we will assume that in each of the tag managers there is a pixel VK, although this is not the case).  Potentially, <b>only 22% of sites in highly competitive niches</b> use retargeting capabilities. <br><br>  He was not found here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7d/fb8/6a5/e7dfb86a505d717ee9a393e3affece4a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Not here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9cc/328/8d2/9cc3288d2630715a5893f3846db0022f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And neither here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20c/0da/c15/20c0dac157ff9c43fe30de02905c564e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Moreover, here even <b>LENDING was</b> not discovered, not to mention the analytics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb5/9b4/bb8/cb59b4bb82b9542b49820bbb409470ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's urgently fix this mess!  Today we will talk about how to add a pixel from Vkontakte, and then I think you can handle it. <br><br>  First of all, you must go to the advertising office.  To do this, go to the Advertisement item on your page, or create an advertising account, if there is no one, at <a href="https://vk.com/ads/targeting">vk.com/ads/targeting</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/761/a43/856/761a4385622180d8ec7d211496f971ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Create a new cabinet.  After that - go to the <b>Retargeting</b> tab, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1b/fd1/ffe/a1bfd1ffe4d2916662dee066c8320f04.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  click on the button <b>Create a single pixel</b> , specify the name of the pixel, the domain and subject. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/703/16f/7b2/70316f7b206dff7081f95aa6ad3607e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The resulting code is set in the section of the necessary pages of our site / landing page and if properly installed for some time (Contact is a kind of roulette that wants to work, wants to not work, therefore, it‚Äôs impossible to predict the exact time) on the <b>Pixels</b> tab opposite your pixel will appear <b>‚ÄúIt works.‚Äù</b> As you guessed, the single name implies that one single pixel can be used for all the pages of one site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b2/4f7/905/6b24f7905af19357a9070bbf5837a7ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Many people make the mistake of stopping at this stage</b> , but it‚Äôs too early to relax, because the green inscription actually works, which simply means that at the moment the pixel is potentially ready to collect visitors into the retargeting database.  But for this we need to create a new audience.  Go to the <b>Audiences</b> tab and click on the <b>Create Audience</b> button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72c/94d/d1c/72c94dd1c5c8f5e83ae87ecdc4312e45.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you are as unorganized as I am, then most likely sooner or later you will see the following message: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce3/2b8/104/ce32b810488323cd156f6bcc974aff7b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But in most cases, the window that opens will look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9b/436/63c/a9b43663c620917f5c09879c3a2fb8e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All you have to do is set the CLEAR name of your audience, choose the source (in this case, let's stop at the retargeting pixel from the site, let's talk about the file later) and set the rule set. <br><br>  As for the rules, there are two main groups of settings: <br><br><ul><li>  the first focuses on the location ( <i>all site visitors, or visitors to individual pages</i> ) </li><li>  the second - on the frequency ( <i>for all time, for the last 3/7/14/30/90/180 days</i> ) </li></ul><br>  The good news is that from one pixel - you can create a huge number of different audiences, separately collecting users who visited certain sections of sites, baskets, certain goods, pages of promotional offers for different periods of time (from the hottest to the oldest customers). <br><br>  Playing with the settings of these parameters (the url fields contain, match or regular expressions, as well as the dates of the last visits to the site) you discover a huge field of actions that, with a certain level of logic and creativity, will allow you to build incredible sales funnels. <br><br>  See you in the next issue! <br><br>  PS: In addition to the VC pixel, you should install the Facebook pixel, the Yandex Metrics script and Google Analytics (but more on that later), and, perhaps, the MayTarget counter <br><br><h2>  Marketing 101.
