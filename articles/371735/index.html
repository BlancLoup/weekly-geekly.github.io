  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New SSD lines from OCZ and other new items from CES 2016</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Geektimes!  Although OCZ has already achieved notable success in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãstorage construction, we are not standing still, because speeds, especially in the case of SSD, as they say, do not happen much.  Therefore, at the last CES 2016 exhibition, we had a separate booth where new products were presented that definitely deserve your attention.  We know that we are a bit late, but I don‚Äôt want to ignore this topic, so it‚Äôs better late than never. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ocz/blog/270512/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5e/0c2/71f/e5e0c271f32e7a3aae76a60fdafcc9e5.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now, most manufacturers of solid-state drives tend to increase speeds, as well as reducing the ratio of the dollar to one gigabyte, and OCZ in this direction is no exception.  We took into account all the wishes and suggestions of users of the Trion 100 disk and present the new Trion 150. <br><br>  Initially, the Trion 100 was positioned as a drive for "beginners" - it is great for studying or working with office applications, but not for launching demanding games or launching programs for graphics processing, not to mention editing video clips.  At the same time, it has good speed characteristics and a 3-year warranty under the ShieldPlus program.

      Trion 150 is a worthy successor to the Trion 100. The drive uses 15 nm TLC NAND flash memory, while the reading speed can reach 550 MB / s, and the write speed - 530 MB / s.  The write speed without caching reaches 190 MB / s.  SSD boasts a new generation of TLC technology that allows you to optimize SSD for low power consumption and keep all the necessary information safe. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/462/c97/214/462c9721442230468ae07ea247f82b64.jpg"></div><br>  In addition, due to the use of new recording algorithms, it was possible to significantly improve the performance of the solid-state drive.  Trion 150 takes the Trion line from the ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù class to the next level: it is perfect even for gamers, especially those who are looking for the best combination between price and performance and do not want (or have not) to buy an expensive drive. <br><br>  You will feel the change in speed right away.  The maximum random read and maximum random write are 90,000 IOPS and 64,000 IOPS, respectively.  You can choose from drives with a capacity of 120 GB, 240 GB, 480 GB and 960 GB. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/581/a3a/d62/581a3ad62e68b7d8962f9968c5022c0d.jpg"></div><br>  Of course, no one has canceled the three-year warranty on ShieldPlus, so if something happens to your drive, which is unlikely, you will not have problems with its maintenance. <br><br>  But we gathered you for one more important reason.  Another OCZ SSD model that debuted at CES is the updated RevoDrive 400 NVMe drive.  The use of the latter made it possible to achieve significant breakthroughs in terms of the speed of reading and writing.  The interface for connecting to the motherboard was selected x4 PCI Express, also uses a controller from Toshiba and 15 nm MLC flash memory. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b20/d5d/153/b20d5d15361d19abd16815d3d70403b6.jpg"></div><br>  What is the speed?  Here you will be pleasantly surprised - up to 2400 MB / s and up to 1500 MB / s for reading and writing, respectively.  But let's not be unfounded, better see for yourself what the indicators turned out in the benchmarks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d64/669/6fc/d646696fc53f907b190ef01873cce253.jpg"></div><br>  Perhaps this is the case when the actual speeds differ from those stated, but not as many are accustomed to (in a negative direction), but, on the contrary, to a positive one.  In the test, a model with a capacity of 512 GB was used, but versions with 128 GB, 256 GB and 1 TB are also available.  The maximum random read is 210,000 IOPS, and the record is 140,000 IOPS.  For comparison: the predecessor RevoDrive 400 - RevoDrive 350, the first indicator settled at around 135,000 IOPS. <br><br>  Yes, and the speed has increased compared to the RevoDrive 350 - it has an indicator for reading and writing 1800 MB / s and 1700 MB / s, respectively, with an endurance of 50 GB / day. <br><br>  Some of the major changes affected the warranty: if the RevoDrive 350 is three years old, then the RevoDrive has 400 full five years, moreover, under the ShieldPlus program.  Now you can not worry about the state of SSD for a long time, even under severe loads.  Of course, monitoring is not necessary to forget about monitoring, but here comes the useful SSD utility Guru, which supports all solid-state drives from OCZ.  With its help it is very convenient to monitor the status of the disk on Windows, Mac and Linux. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9e/87a/062/c9e87a062b8e4727a2e2be2ec1652035.jpg"></div><br>  RevoDrive 400 is a real beast that can cope with top games, and with the most demanding applications, and with graphics programs, including working with 3D.  Still, 2.7 GB / s in solid-state drives are not often seen. <br><br>  In addition to consumer solutions, CES also showed solutions for the corporate segment - for example, the Z-Drive 6300 AIC Series, the future of storage for use in companies.  PCIe 3.0, power overload protection, adapted for low power consumption, and even capacity from 800 GB to 6.4 TB.  2800 MB / s for reading and 1600 MB / s for writing.  For corporate needs the most it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/048/931/469/048931469c8b61b3999a292875f6f3c2.jpg"></div><br>  Actually, the entire line of Z-Drive deserves attention - each drive has its own characteristics, take the same U.2 Series.  Good speed performance, long warranty and capacity up to 3.2 TB. <br><br>  The set of SSD for corporate solutions is really big, and each organization will be able to choose the best option for itself. <br><br>  Not spared, and server drives Saber 1000 or Intrepid 3700, which are significantly faster with long write loads.  Suitable for really hard tasks.  Saber 1000 HMS allows developers to use additional drive control with the HMS API.  SSD performance improves even at lower cost. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/19e/826/bc8/19e826bc8d8e6b53d60fa99a1333030c.jpg"></div><br>  As you can see, the beginning of the year was really intense for OCZ.  But there is still a lot of interesting things ahead, and we will continue to work to ensure that your disks are even faster and serve even longer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371735/</a></p>
