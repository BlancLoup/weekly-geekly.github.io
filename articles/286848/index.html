      Where technology has brought cinema, and what it is today, we all know very well.  Imagine, working on the old methods of cinemas, studios, etc., will they be competitive today?  The same rules are now relevant for email marketing. <br><br>  Companies are trumpeting that e-mail is becoming the leading communication channel.  We offer to understand and evaluate email marketing.  Once we have found a connection with cinema, so let's nominate email marketing for an Oscar.  If everything is correct, then the reward will go straight to him. <br><br>  Leadership email marketing confirms research company <a href="http://www.adestra.com/resources/downloadable-reports/2014-email-marketing-industry-census/">Adestra Marketing Census</a> .  In 2014, email marketing exceeded SEO in terms of profitability, which gives it the right to be considered the most effective digital channel.  In addition, Adestra noted other interesting facts that marketers need to know in 2015.  We know that your time is valuable, so we reviewed the <a href="http://hosted.adestra.com/adestra/census/Email-Census-2014.pdf">report</a> and selected the <b>5 most important facts</b> you need to know in order to create effective email campaigns. <br><br><h2>  1. Email marketing sells well </h2><br>  Marketers have long praised search engine optimization ... Although SEO is a powerful digital tool, email marketing is more personalized.  Marketers can get and use much more data about their audience than with SEO.  By the way, we already mentioned personalization in the blog - <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/blog/20-faktov-pochemy-vajna-personalizaciya/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dcontent%26amp%3Butm_term%3Dsoldatov%26amp%3Butm_content%3Doskar%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">20 interesting facts</a> . <br><br>  <b>68% of companies rated email marketing as an excellent or good tool in terms of profitability.</b>  SEO is also estimated by 65% ‚Äã‚Äãof marketers, content marketing is only 63%.  Contextual advertising, social networks, referral marketing, mobile devices and banner advertising are behind these three strongest channels. <br><br>  The popularity of email marketing can be associated with increased sales.  <b>The surveyed companies associate 23% of their sales with email marketing in 2014, compared with 18% a year earlier.</b>  Companies spent on email marketing about 15% of the budget, which paid off considerably. <br><br>  Only 42% of respondents rated their email campaigns well.  <b>Marketers are aware that they can do much more to increase the effectiveness of email marketing.</b> <br><br>  Already agree to give Oscar to email marketing? <br><br><h2>  2. Automation is the path to the customer. </h2><br>  One of the improvement options that marketers know about is automation.  Respondents were asked to describe the benefits of automating email marketing, which they used (did not use) in their campaigns.  83% of them recognized the benefits.  However, 89% of companies indicated that they had the opportunity to use automation, although <b>almost half of them said that the tools were basic</b> <b>and allowed to automatically send messages under standard conditions</b> .  For example, a greeting and thanks when making a customer subscription. <br><br>  For more information about mailing automation, see the article <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/blog/kak-sdelat-e-mejl-rassylki-v-5-raz-proshhe-i-v-5-raz-bystree/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dcontent%26amp%3Butm_term%3Dsoldatov%26amp%3Butm_content%3Doskar%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">‚ÄúHow to make an email mailing 5 times easier and 5 times faster.‚Äù</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/913/b04/ee4/913b04ee47f9a887fa8fdfb828de8cec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  3. Always remember about mobile devices. </h2><br>  More than half of all emails today are read on mobile devices.  79% of surveyed companies have at least the basic ability to adapt letters for smartphones.  Optimization does not reduce the information in the letter, but allows you to display the content in full.  <b>Optimizing emails for mobile devices using simple templates or responsive design is crucial</b> in maintaining and increasing ROI, since reading mail on a smartphone is already common. <br><br>  Imagine you came to the cinema and saw the movie only on a half-screen, or, even worse, the picture went far beyond its scope ... What emotions will you have besides anger and resentment?  Will you watch the film, will you return to this cinema afterwards?  With mobile devices as well, no one will read your content if it is uncomfortable.  Do you think customers will try again after a sad experience?  Unfortunately not! <br><br><h2>  4. Personalization in a team with automation - this is the future </h2><br>  Almost <b>80% of surveyed companies believe that email marketing will be completely personalized in just 5 years</b> .  In addition, 85% believe that email marketing will be integrated to the maximum with other channels, which will enable customers to experience an individual approach to the full.  How all this will look like, the question is still incomprehensible.  Now the possibilities for personalization are limited to data about the audience that you have collected. <br><br>  Almost half of surveyed marketers believe that e-mail will be connected to a single communications system.  At the moment, personalization is often achieved by connecting databases to email services, which simply absorbs the time of marketers. <br><br>  Marketers here are almost like old projectionists, which we talked about at the beginning of the article.  Remember, they had to transport reels of film, dividing it into pieces, and then re-glue?  Now it seems incredible, since everything has changed completely. <br><br>  You too need to start <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dcontent%26amp%3Butm_term%3Dsoldatov%26amp%3Butm_content%3Doskar%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">improving communication with your users</a> .  This will help increase the loyalty of your users, increase the conversion rate and the number of repeat purchases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bb2/3d3/43d/bb23d343d0defe7599d2f2ce6f9332a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  5. Do not spend a lot of time on design. </h2><br>  The main obstacle in creating responsive email templates or complex automatic and personal campaigns is the time spent on design and layout.  <b>63% of respondents said they spent two or more hours on the design elements of email campaigns</b> , to the detriment of the strategy and plan.  At the same time, they recognize that spending time on design, to the detriment of content and optimization, reduces ROI.  The task is difficult, because  there is often a mistaken impression that there is a lot of time for additional elements that visually improve the letter. <br><br>  Some studies show that letters with a ‚Äústandard‚Äù design (read without design) are read more often.  The recipient simply does not perceive them as advertising. <br><br>  Unfortunately or fortunately, Oscar is a purely cinematic award and we can only give it conditionally and jokingly to email marketing.  Decide on its significance for yourself, but be sure to take the listed facts to note.  They will help you stay in the trend of Internet marketing, catch up and overtake competitors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286848/</a></p>
