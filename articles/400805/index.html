      This game reminds me of brawn with horseradish.  Or dumplings with vodka.  Another sausage with mustard <s><font color="#a2a2a2">God, how to eat something you want</font></s> .  Because it is perfectly balanced simplicity of the gameplay and the vigor of the gameplay, during which you can suddenly lose half of the card because of one small ‚Äúbale!‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/760/e7b/b3b/760e7bb3bcb74b8aada53bbd8cb23ccd.jpg"><br><br>  Can play from 1 to 10 players.  The number of players is selected in the main menu of the game, the number of rounds that you intend to play is selected there.  You can also adjust the strength of the wind, the visibility of the trajectories, the reflection of shells from the limits of the playing field;  indicate whether you want to play as a team and whether you want to bluntly qualitatively from a height when there is no land under you.  For each player, a keyboard / mouse control is configured.  If there is no one to play with, <s><font color="#a2a2a2">Billy Milligan</font></s> AI will come to the rescue with multi-split personality.  You can choose your opponent by skill or trust in fate.  The landscape is generated randomly.  At the end of each round, you can replenish your arsenal for points earned. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Then everything is simple: the selected weapon + angle + power of the shot = uncontrollable fun</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-rAY1VSVNY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  Separately, I want to bow to the belt to the developer for the background selection button in the main menu, filled with love for humanity.  No seriously.  I have met for the backdrop of this game a lot of definitions, ranging from ‚ÄúHurray, thanks to this I remember the game!‚Äù To ‚Äúoriginal, uh-uh, charm‚Äù, and I completely agree with the latter.  10 rounds accompanied by this hypnoboad - and it seems that you, along with Albert Hoffman and Timothy Leary, are shooting under the substances of the evil FBI somewhere in the spurs of the Alps, under a benign cow mooing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/363/17f/5c4/36317f5c4b7640f2b742c6d5d8e18c64.jpg"><br><br>  The heir to the old game considers itself the Tank Wars Classic game, available for Android 2.3 and higher, but ‚Äî to my taste, of course ‚Äî the remake frankly loses to the original.  The developer turned the waste of a collective farm thresher into an unhurried bourgeois duel with breaks for dances and a buffet table. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hare CRI!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.classicdosgames.com/game/Tank_Wars.html">RGB Classic Games page</a> <br>  <em>Versions 1.2 through 3.2 + Online Version (Java)</em> </li><li>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dde.joer.scribbleTankWars%26hl%3Dru">PunkHorse's remake of the game on GooglePlay</a> </li></ul><br></div></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ada/ac7/a35/adaac7a35ac54a6fa913bf73ff0370bb.jpg"></div><br><br><h2>  <font color="#586c93">Scorched Tanks.</font>  <font color="#586c93">Good artists copy, great artists steal.</font> </h2><br>  <i><sup><font color="#586c93">Developer: <s>Kirkorov</s> Michael Welch</font></sup></i> <i><sup><font color="#586c93"><br></font></sup></i>  <i><sup><font color="#586c93">Release dates: March 1993 - December 1994 (v1.9)</font></sup></i> <i><sup><font color="#586c93"><br></font></sup></i>  <i><sup><font color="#586c93">Platform: Amiga</font></sup></i> <br><br>  In the last article, we recalled the "mother of all games."  So, Scorched Tank is an aunt, whom a visiting fellow has snagged, having previously rolled the poor thing into the Bukhara family carpet.  Michael Welch then saw the game for the first time for the RS <s><font color="#a2a2a2">, yes, Scorched Earth</font></s> , played a little, admired immensely and decided to do something similar for the Amiga, which at that time lacked a "competitive artillery game." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92a/4ab/599/92a4ab5993e44967a086ff9c53cf4a4e.jpg"><br><br>  The main drawbacks of the ‚ÄúScorched Earth‚Äù were considered to be poorly crafted textures, a buggy interface and a playing field limited by the screen, making it difficult to use powerful weapons without the risk of dropping it onto the tower itself.  Welch corrected these shortcomings, but he did it, by his own admission, by chance, since he reproduced the game from memory without having access to the PC.  Compared to the ancestor, the game is considered ‚Äúmade more professionally,‚Äù although they are similar as twins raised in different families. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Gameplay video</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P-9O1TOSfCM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  Up to 4 players can participate in the game.  The main menu adjusts the initial amount of your military budget, the number of rounds, the number of players.  If the opponent is a computer, then the level of ‚Äúintellect‚Äù is chosen for it, and the <s><font color="#a2a2a2">degree of borzota is the</font></s> preferred combat tactic - from a dull defense to an aggressive attack.  The purchase is made at the beginning of each round, unused weapons can be sold. <br><br>  The most notable change was the expansion of the playing field.  Yes, it complicated the gameplay: the players, who were freely located on the map, were sometimes forced to shoot at random.  But everything was redeemed by the possibility of using a weapon without false shame and fear for one‚Äôs physiognomy, for which, in the company of gentlemen playing SE, one could ogreste a <s><font color="#a2a2a2">candelabrum of</font></s> wall-mounted sconces produced by the Moscow Radio Instrument plant.  And all the weapons in the latest version was already 70 species.  In the future, it was planned to increase the number to 100 varieties, but the 1994 version was the last for the Amiga.  But not for the game itself. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hello I'm your aunt!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <a href="http://aminet.net/package/game/shoot/Scorch185">Game page on Aminet</a> <br>  <em>m68k-amigaos</em> </li></ul><br></div></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ada/ac7/a35/adaac7a35ac54a6fa913bf73ff0370bb.jpg"></div><br><br>

Michael is still faithful to Amiga's visual aesthetics and for each of his games he puts on the site a free version, with only limited content.  Some packages with additional game weapons are also free.  A paid package will cost you 99 cents, and for only $ 19.99 you can get a version of <s><font color="#a2a2a2">super mega exclusive VIP only</font></s> deluxe with a fully stocked arsenal.  320 types of weapons!  In someone the Minister of Defense vanishes, yes. <br><br>  In addition to common exploding, burrowing and blocking options, there are still quite demeaning for the enemy (for example, Water Balloons and Gyro Glue) and auxiliary ones that improve your shooting results.  The vastness of the arsenal determines the flexibility of tactical decisions and provokes an aggravation of greed in a player who is not able to drag everything into the game at the same time.  There is an opportunity to play on a local network and Wi-Fi, the <s><font color="#a2a2a2">kindergarten</font></s> mode of shooting is working  The winner is determined based on the amount of damage done. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Gameplay video</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dXp-ztfuHjM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  If you do not have a partner, then the computer will be your company.  Just tell him how hard you need to resist, on a scale from 1 to 10.

The fauna of this genre is surprisingly diverse, and how much more can you realize?  Giraffes are railguns.  Porcupines are nails.  Ground beetles overflowed with napalm.  For developers from a country where the heir to the throne slaps in rubber boots in the meadows, inspecting herds, pigs are quite suitable heroes.  Sheep would be a more logical choice, but pigs are angrier and smarter.  Communication with a pig that was configured in a fighting manner, in my recollections, only slightly falls short of communication with an suspicious cow, which I, at an unkind hour, caught in the village street. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2c/6af/bf3/e2c6afbf3120449ca1638c095224bff3.jpg"><br><br>  Among the features that highlight HoW among its peers, I can single out the following: <br><br>  First, the third dimension.  Three years before Worms3D and one year before Scorched3D; <br><br>  Secondly, the hog has a specialization, each soldier can be pumped to a certain level, which in turn will give him unique skills and weapons.  However, contrary to this separation, every pig can use any type of weapon found on the ground or dropped from an airship; <br><br>  Thirdly, the plot, humor and voice.  It is fourth and fifth. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Gameplay video</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8f3WDkSg8is" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  The plot unfolds during the era of the First World War, during which the anthropomorphic pigs of six nations fight for the Sostrahlia archipelago, seeking to seize the Drain Island.  Throughout all campaigns, you will have to sit on the defensive and attack, disguise, spy, steal, destroy buildings, bridges and equipment, provide first aid and earn medals that are spent on pumping fighters. <br><br>  In addition to the single-player campaign - for the right to hoist the flag over the island - there is multiplayer.  In addition to the classic hotseat, the PC version of the game has a network mode, but <s><font color="#a2a2a2">through</font></s> the setting process it can be used as punishment for sinners, along with flogging with a wet rod and standing in a corner on a pea. <br><br>  <s><font color="#a2a2a2">PC spit</font></s> connoisseurs strongly recommend the version for the PlayStation, since in it the enemy, controlled by AI, is mobile, can use buildings and combat vehicles to secure a tactical advantage.  Fortunately, there are now many PS1 simulators for almost any platform.  But on the PC you can get the title of Legend, if you modify the save game. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4e/4ad/79d/c4e4ad79d52a4c2aaf2f41c159806006.jpg"><br><br>  Of the relative shortcomings, you can point out the indestructible landscape and the absence of the influence of atmospheric phenomena on the results of the shooting, but we are mentally without it. <br><br>  On February 13, 2008, Infogrames announced Hogs of War 2, the game was scheduled for April 2009, but the game was canceled due to lack of funds.  The development of the franchise, apparently, was completely buried. <br><br>  There is a group of enthusiastic developers who they have forgotten to call for a funeral: they stubbornly develop a continuation of the legendary series, having previously designated it as HoW2.  The discussions I had seen on Igromania and GameDev.ru were very stingy, in short they can be conveyed in three words: ‚ÄúFu!‚Äù, ‚ÄúRights ?!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù.  The answer is - <a href="https://vk.com/hogsofwar2">here</a> , the work is still underway. <br><br>  I sincerely hope that the history of HoW will not end.  That there will be more wars, say, between Bekongo and Shkvarkomerun during the African campaign of Hryummel.  Huge tanks firm SaltissenHrupps, crawling on the savannah.  And other nonsense, funny and ironic, which so adorns our too serious life. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Throw doors to Swinarnia</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLWTi3Tq8AyErFaAJOWlcETwEhqoSwsZfQ">Original pigs</a> <br>  <em>demo video posted by the author of the game</em> </li></ul><br></div></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ada/ac7/a35/adaac7a35ac54a6fa913bf73ff0370bb.jpg"></div><br><br>  For today, perhaps, it is enough.
