I also decided not to lag behind and show the habra people my old man, who didn‚Äôt really go to rest and is still working for the benefit of humanity.  So, Dell Latitude XPi CD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/610/055/8fb/6100558fba79be9b6235a2b45d726b8f.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Caution!</i>  <i>A lot of pictures.</i>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This unit acquired a few years ago from a friend <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/arxont/" class="user_link">arxont</a> for a penny.  At first, of course, I was happy as a child a laptop a decade old.  The unit is well preserved, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãbright, the battery is kept as new, the drive reads, the screw has no bads, there are almost no scuffs and scratches.  Made from my favorite rough black plastic from the 90s.  Now almost nothing is made of it, everything is glossy.  The screen is also a nice matte. <br><br>  And over time, the laptop began to bring not only aesthetic pleasure, but also practical benefits.  Over the years, less and less iron remained in the ranks with a com port and support for specific DOS software.  So old man Dell became my main tool for programming radio stations. <br><br>  The old man's keyboard is original, with Japanese characters and a bit unusual key layout.  The keys themselves are quite high with a big move.  The keyboard did not understand, but it is felt that the keys are not suspended on modern rocker.  Metal elements are visible, but there is no clang. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50b/276/e06/50b276e066c1fab26dd22d0d2ff1e022.jpg"><br><br>  In the lid is an ordinary, but quite comfortable latch. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f23/75e/71c/f2375e71cf8b0ebb5e5804f1bb0b36ab.jpg"><br><br>  The red insert I do not understand on the lid, between the logo and the latch. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb9/a96/d14/fb9a96d1492547b4cdee765efb0eecaa.jpg"><br><br>  The front side of the laptop.  On the left is the hard disk slide.  The glass pink window is the first infrared port (yes, there are two IR ports in this laptop).  Drive and flop. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f7/d8e/c68/2f7d8ec682d4a6ce929e05c6fba7e463.jpg"><br><br>  Left view.  From left to right: a folding leg, an on / off button, 2 PCMCIA slots, a ventilation slot above them, a screw cap in which for some reason there is a hole for the anti-lock plate and standard sound connectors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ae5/a97/24d/ae5a9724d26bee277fe5ed76b621006b.jpg"><br><br>  Back view.  From left to right: LPT, COM, PS / 2, VGA, second infrared port, dock connector, power connector. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/030/989/479/030989479ad5e8c9f74ae434a9e35553.jpg"><br><br>  And on this photo you can see that all the connectors are covered with protective plastic curtains. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f92/0e9/d01/f920e9d01c28289cc5f24184302edfaf.jpg"><br><br>  The right view is not particularly remarkable, except for the battery compartment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/06b/e3c/066/06be3c066af34ce3318c19f23258219f.jpg"><br><br>  View from above.  The LED indicators in the lid are two-sided, they are visible both when the lid is open and when it is so closed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f3/b4f/e06/9f3b4fe06375af3c341a2e486114e06e.jpg"><br><br>  Bottom view.  No ventilation and heaps of compartments, bolt holes are also rich. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f2/782/570/7f2782570588be55b8f5b8e818248676.jpg"><br><br>  Drive unit.  Quite naughty, reads only factory stamping or a CD-R with a closed session.  And since there are no other quick ways to transfer data to this laptop, you have to ruin a myriad of blanks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b27/604/ea0/b27604ea0d3a5356366efcc677ea1c5a.jpg"><br><br>  Separately, I want to mention the trackball.  I saw very few laptops with the trackball.  Quite a handy thing, if you get used to it, you can work in gloves. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e9/86b/4b7/7e986b4b71c47b0cdfa496549d641c99.jpg"><br><br>  Indicators in the lid, in the keyboard and built-in microphone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b54/801/d8c/b54801d8c151837e2b9167531350f4d8.jpg"><br><br>  The screw is removed notably, first the slide of the slide is moved, then the handle is pulled out, by which the screw with a capacity of 1.3 GB can be removed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/817/cfe/16a/817cfe16aee0a11a8541d658dd04f301.jpg"><br><br>  On the hard disk, too, Japanese characters. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0f1/766/2b0/0f17662b06ba1bca8fdfff1c22459dc4.jpg"><br><br>  Such a "mobile phone" is quite weighty (thick screw), as well as the laptop itself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef4/f66/bab/ef4f66babf1ed58e311c7b20d2c92306.jpg"><br><br>  The laptop stands on folding legs, the battery shield is open. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/91c/3cd/967/91c3cd9670d89b15b0201bd4c328bf75.jpg"><br><br>  Removing the battery.  The row of white stripes at the corner of the battery is a real charge indicator (you can see a small button next to it). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c8/9e7/41b/1c89e741b53b53f741ea1469f646bc89.jpg"><br><br>  This LED charge indicator as if tells us that the battery is fully charged (it still lasts for one and a half to two hours of work). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/144/299/a0e/144299a0eeff8786f03f03825b5e6bf7.jpg"><br><br>  BIOS immediately after switching on, bytes of RAM are considered.  Loading ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b33/d93/eb7/b33d93eb77ac19f253025e6ae0e74d47.jpg"><br><br>  Immediately after the bios, the dosovsky part of the 98 vents. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b2c/895/887/b2c8958877ac8d75197335eed357975b.jpg"><br><br>  And of course, the boot screen familiar to many people flashes for a moment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b99/f5a/fee/b99f5afee54f3506fc796874d0d40b5e.jpg"><br><br>  Computer properties  40 meters is enough for comfortable work.  On his younger colleague, the seven hardly turn over at 8 GB. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/627/73f/885/62773f885cf1aac3332662c3554d994d.jpg"><br><br>  As well as the properties of the system can be viewed in the BIOS, without unloading the system itself.  With the shortcut keys you can get into the BIOS, change something and go back to the OS.  Conveniently. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d1/e30/25c/0d1e3025c32c60972f7045954d8c24ab.jpg"><br><br>  The BIOS tells us that the old man is equipped with P-150, 40 Mb RAM, 1.1 Mb video.  For '97, this is certainly not a weak configuration. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/994/4ce/9d9/9944ce9d9e0364651f5b1945962cfd7e.jpg"><br><br>  Therefore, in addition to working software for programming stations ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/930/87c/0d2/93087c0d2c43583d52aee31465b9e06b.jpg"><br><br>  It is quite possible to drive the first quack in the resolution of 320x240 with acceptable fps. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f48/433/3da/f484333da98da87636d62b39a0b54c77.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the laptop works like a clock, the old man really lacks a network for comfortable work.  Nowhere can I find a PCMCIA-LAN adapter that would be friends with windows 9x.  And I would also like to purchase another battery, in reserve.  But alas, they are no longer produced or sold. <br><br>  I could not wait to share with you photos, so there was no time to clean up the working mess on the table and invite the photographer.  Report inaccuracies or errors in the comments.  I would be grateful if you can tell more about this laptop. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139424/</a></p>
