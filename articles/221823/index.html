Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/129/ed3/ff8/129ed3ff8f25efdb6ae3157a7739da84.png"><br><br>  Hello Habr!  So I decided to write my first post.  And there are plenty of reasons for this.  There was free time, and I decided to bring my idea to life.  As the name implies, this is a toy Crazy Cube World Game (Crazy World of Cubes).  In the first post I will talk about the concept of the game.  I‚Äôve been building Minecraft servers for a long time, digging around the source of the game, mods.  I studied other sandboxes and, as for me, something was always lacking.  This all led to the creation of the game.  In general, it will be some kind of RPG mix, sandboxes with unlimited open world. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since we started talking about him first, let's continue and so that the world is: 
      <br>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a7/cff/397/1a7cff3977cf028794e0a70606b2e095.jpg"><br><br>  The world will be divided into planetary systems containing various planets, an open and documented kernel API will allow you to add your modifications to the game.  In a network game, at the very beginning, null will be available - a system where there will be no PvP mode and players will be able to get used to the game, rise to the level (RPG).  We can build and destroy naturally everywhere and everything (from the block on the planet to the destruction of the planetary system).  Generation of the planets' landscape will be dynamic, tied only to the Recourse Pack of the given planet (descriptions of everything and everything). <br><br>  Let's go now on the RPG stuffing.  Thinking it was decided to proceed as follows.  The first time as soon as we appear in the game, we appear in the Stone Age in whatever be null - the planetary system in whatever may be the planet usable at this level for the character to live.  In the hands of course nothing.  Immediately make a reservation, all the craft in the game will be close to the real one, so as I think it will be difficult to craft it.  The first craft, for example, can be, for example, a sharp stone, for which you need to find only two stones.  As you progress, the quests will develop, and our world.  If at first we can unite people (NPC) into a community.  Then we will be able to unite in villages, cities, countries (such as guilds, alliances).  Here the first aspect of the game manifests itself, as soon as the first craft of weapons appears (although the same selected stick can serve as a weapon) we can attack other NPCs or, on the contrary, try to establish peaceful relations with them (they will have character).  Attacks, peaceful relations will all affect further progress in the world.  For example, if in the area and the character will be the reputation of the conqueror, then coming to the next village you will surely be met with a weapon in hand.  So, and where is the universe?  All development in the game will occur in the game gradually, starting with the Stone Age and ending with the universe.  In fact, we‚Äôll start with a stick, a stone in our hand, and end with space flights, exploration of the universe.  Do not forget about the sandbox.  It is not necessary to get involved in wars, to equip their cities, villages, etc.  It will be possible to simply adjoin to the already existing ones and live peacefully, or create chaos.  Those.  In the game there will be a world in which everything that can be imagined is allowed. <br><br>  Kraft is still simple, but they will be divided into two subspecies: the creation of one character, the creation of the factories (in groups).  Likewise with quests, they will include not entirely trivial studies of caves (with different puzzles, etc.) to confusing stories. <br><br>  Let's talk now about the character, he will have the following characteristics: <br><br>  <b>Intellect</b> - will be pumped as the crafts are found, the puzzles pass through quests, without it they will not be able to create new craft, even knowing them. <br>  <b>Endurance</b> - will be responsible for how much time we will be able to work (i.e. it will be impossible to just walk up and break twenty stones, for example, the character will get tired and he will need time to rest) <br>  <b>Strength</b> - will be responsible for the weight that can carry a character, a weapon that he can hold in his hands, in battles with small values, we will not be able to throw some rivals. <br>  <b>Fear</b> - approximately will work as follows, having died several times when descending into a cave, a character will refuse to go there, or having met an unkind mob that killed him several times, rush away from him. <br><br>  And many other types of <b>skills like hunting, farming, chemistry, science, lock hacking, gun ownership</b> <br>  . <br>  As already mentioned above, the world around will develop and grow with you, then the player will not be able to predict what to face, for example, by landing and settling a colony on another planet, you will encounter extreme conditions or a colony of evil mobs awakened after a long hibernation, or to an unfriendly alien civilization, or vice versa to get to a paradise at all. <br>  Every item in the game will have its own margin of safety, it will have to be either repaired or recycled. <br>  The process of the game can be represented in a simplified form as a diagram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a77/581/cc2/a77581cc2e158fb08d32b7208d76c136.jpg"><br><br>  Gameplay will vary the scale of development.  In solitary existence, we travel, we try to be friends with the NPC, or we rob apartments in cities, we kill by orders, we hide from law enforcement officers.  In the second mode we will be able to establish trade relations, or drop a couple of nuclear bombs on a neighbor.  Both modes are linked, controlling the people, you yourself can take for example a ship and go on a search for yourself. <br><br>  In general, the gaming process itself can be talked about for a long time.  But perhaps this will stop.  At the moment, sawing editor and engine.  The platform was chosen <b>.NET 4.5, XNA 4.0, C # Visual Studio 2013</b> .  The engine is able to display simple chunks.  Now the plans are as follows: <br><br>  1. Make a generator of the world, capable of generating interesting landscapes. <br>  2. Simulation of liquids. <br>  3. The creation of the first game era of the Stone Age, the release of the alpha version, and of course the wiki on the game. <br>  4. Publication of the project on the kickstarter. <br><br>  If you are interested in the next article, I‚Äôll already discuss why XNA does, how to build in the engine + source code. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br>  The project successfully moved under MonoGame and there will be a version for Linux, Mac OS and if everything goes well then in the plans for Android, Ios and the console. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221823/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221823/</a></p>
