Colleagues from Mail.ru have been sharing a review of Russian events for several years in a row (here is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/247243/">list for 2015</a> , waiting for a similar review for 2016), and I decided to go overseas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/152/fd5/36d/152fd536dd9a46889ee11477d82c238b.jpg"><br><br>  Why import conferences?  The Russian ones are also very interesting, but sometimes you want to combine business with pleasure: not only to listen to smart people and establish new connections in the US and Western European markets that are relevant for us, but also to see some pleasant city. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Criterias of choice:

    <ul><li>  Conference language: English. </li><li>  Location: Europe and the USA. </li><li>  We celebrate local events that only local students attend. </li><li>  Subjects: Development, testing, management, Web, .NET, Java, LAMP, mobile development. </li><li>  Speech: if there is a real opportunity to speak at the conference - this is a big plus.  If the conference is held in a non-English speaking country (say, in Sweden or the Netherlands), this is a plus +, because the roughness of Russian English will be less prevalent over the speaker. </li></ul><br>  So here is my list of noteworthy conferences.  For each, the price of the ticket is given in the appropriate currency (dollars, pounds, euros, different crowns).  I don‚Äôt see any sense in translating into rubles in today's environment. <br><br><h4>  1. NDC London, January 13-15 </h4>  <a href="http://ndc-london.com/">ndc-london.com</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/343/703/a7b/343703a7b62e4c749aa95de4444c8f42.jpg"><br><br>  NDC (Norwegian Developers Conference) is the largest European conference on .NET, Web and Agile.  First held in Oslo in 2008, later it began to be held also in London and Sydney. <br><br>  It will take three days in multi-threaded mode (from 6 to 8 tracks).  Large sections are as follows: .NET, Web, DevOps, Big Data, Azure, IoT, Frontend.  For two days before the conference, workshops are held (for a fee). <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : ¬£ 1,190 (plus VAT 20%).  Prices are for participation in the conference, without workshops - full layout - <a href="http://ndc-london.com/page/tickets">right here</a> . <br><br><h4>  2. Mobile World Congress, Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãFebruary 22-25 </h4>  <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/">www.mobileworldcongress.com</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60a/000/51e/60a00051e6e74340a6a8b939146405e7.jpg"><br><br>  The largest exhibition and conference dedicated to mobile communications, mobile hardware, IoT, Smart City, mobile development, security, advertising and monetization.  There are many interesting reports.  Speakers, including top managers of PayPal, Cisco, Ericsson, Huawei and others. <br><br>  The conference and exhibition are held within 4 days, the conference - in four streams.  The event is bright, interesting, and the weather at the end of February is pretty pleasant there than in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : ‚Ç¨ 2199 (plus VAT 21%) for Silver Pass.  There is a cheaper option - Exhibition Visitor Pass (‚Ç¨ 749 + 21%), but with it you can only knock about at the exhibition, attendance at the conference is not included.  Full layout - <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/passes-prices/">here</a> . <br><br>  MWC has a sister event - <a href="http://www.mwcshanghai.com/">Mobile World Congress Shanghai</a> .  In general, it is logical, closer to the real manufacturers of mobile equipment.  This year will be held from June 29 to July 01. <br><br><h4>  3. QCon London, March 07-09 </h4>  <a href="http://qconlondon.com/">qconlondon.com</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf2/aeb/1a3/bf2aeb1a32e0445ca09b9e612319abcf.jpg"><br><br>  Traditional multi-day (3 days) and multi-track (6 tracks per day) conference.  From interesting: Full Stack JavaScript, Java 9 &amp; Spring 5, DevOps in practice, Docker containers in production, Modern Native Languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Go, Rust, Swift), Modern Agile Development. <br><br>  Holes in the schedule of reports are still quite a few, but it is difficult to get into the number of speakers - most of the speakers are invited by the organizers.  Of course, a person "from the street" can send the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa report, and they can consider this idea.  Let's try.  Within two days after the end of the conference workshops are held (for a fee).  The dates are especially good for those who want to avoid giving / receiving flowers on the occasion of a gender holiday. <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : from ¬£ 1250 to ¬£ 1500 (plus VAT 20%) - the later you register, the more you pay.  Prices are for participation in the conference, without workshops - full layout - <a href="http://qconlondon.com/registration">right here</a> . <br><br><h4>  4. O'Reilly Fluent - The Web Platform, San Francisco, March 08-10 </h4>  <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us">conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30c/280/5bd/30c2805bd63f43e4967502eec337bd36.jpg"><br><br>  Conference for Web developers.  Topics: JS frameworks, various development tools and platforms, UX, security. <br>  Ideas for speeches are accepted <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us/public/content/contact">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : There are several types of passes - the Silver Pass seems to be the most reasonable - it costs $ 1,695.  Unlike the cheapest ticket gives access to all practical exercises.  Details <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us/public/register">are here</a> . <br><br>  From 09 to 11 November, a similar conference will be held in Amsterdam.  There is no site for this conference yet, there are a couple of references to it <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2016/oreilly-fluent-conference/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/conferences/">here</a> .  We will follow. <br><br><h4>  5. JDays, Gothenburg (Sweden), March 08-09 </h4>  <a href="http://jdays.se/">jdays.se</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a4/986/68c/9a498668cf2c4d7dad97d372f06c29d6.jpg"><br><br>  A two-day conference dedicated to developing in Java and everything around it.  Conducted in English (I participated, I confirm!). <br><br>  Rapporteurs are mainly from Sweden, Denmark and Norway;  They will talk about the future of Java, frontend, microservices, a little about project management - in general, a fairly standard set of topics.  Workshops will be held within one day after the conference (for a fee).  The town is small and pleasant - I would recommend the Volvo Museum from the sights. <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : from ‚Ç¨ 700 (plus VAT 25%) - the later you register, the more you pay.  Prices are for participation in the conference, without workshops.  The prices on the site are not posted, the organizers send an invoice after registration, and this had to be used. <br><br><h4>  6. JSConf Budapest, May 12-13 </h4>  <a href="http://jsconfbp.com/">jsconfbp.com</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/882/479/421/882479421b414dec9690ea982f89d153.jpg"><br><br>  A two-day conference dedicated to JavaScript and in general everything related to the frontend.  The atmosphere is not pretentious, the reports are interesting.  It is inexpensive + Budapest in May is beautiful. <br><br>  The speakers are mainly from Eastern Europe.  Become another speaker from Eastern Europe is quite real. <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : ‚Ç¨ 402 (VAT included).  Details <a href="https://ti.to/jsconf-bp/jsconf-budapest-2016%3F_ga%3D1.213190292.1628966973.1450942647">are here</a> . <br><br><h4>  7. Better Software Conference, Agile Development Conference, DevOps Conference West, Las Vegas June 5-10 </h4>  <a href="http://bscwest.techwell.com/">bscwest.techwell.com</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71f/134/995/71f13499533041db9e5881d6f13b53ab.jpg"><br><br>  3 conferences for the price of one!  The program for 2016 has not yet been announced, in 2015 the themes of the software part were these: mobile development and testing, design and UX, security.  Reports are no longer accepted - sadness ... <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : from $ 1795 (only for participation in the conference, without workshops). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Full layout is available only after registration, I provide a screenshot</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a22/266/cef/a22266cef8c64eb2b15ec347cd137300.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  In November, a similar event is held in Orlando - <a href="http://bsceast.techwell.com/">Better Software Conference East</a> . <br><br><h4>  8. NDC Oslo, June 08-10 </h4>  <a href="http://ndcoslo.com/">ndcoslo.com</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/798/7a1/d4b/7987a1d4be5c41bf9627fc03db64691e.jpg"><br><br>  The twin conference of the above NDC London.  I would venture to suggest that the program will be consonant with London (.NET, Web, DevOps, Big Data, Azure, IoT, Frontend). <br><br>  For two days before the conference, workshops are held (for a fee).  Until February 15 accepted the ideas of the reports. <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : NOK 10500-12500 (plus VAT 25%).  Prices are for participation in the conference, without workshops.  <a href="http://ndcoslo.com/page/tickets">Here is the</a> full layout. <br><br><h4>  9. QCon New York, June 13-15 </h4>  <a href="https://qconnewyork.com/">qconnewyork.com</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd5/c49/4a8/fd5c494a89a04e9f85e341928868bb54.jpg"><br><br>  The ‚Äúsister‚Äù of QCon London, described above.  Supposedly, the program will include topics about architecture, High Load, IoT, frontend. <br>  Holes in the schedule of reports are still quite a few, but it is difficult to get into the number of speakers - most of the speakers are invited by the organizers.  Of course, a person "from the street" can send the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa report, and they can consider this idea.  Let's try. <br><br>  Within two days after the end of the conference workshops are held (for a fee). <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : from $ 1,755 to $ 2,525 - the later you register, the more you pay.  Prices are for participation in the conference, without workshops - full layout - <a href="https://qconnewyork.com/registration">right here</a> . <br><br><h4>  10. Dutch PHP Conference, Amsterdam, June 23-25 </h4>  <a href="http://www.phpconference.nl/">www.phpconference.nl</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c2/5a9/718/4c25a9718f86404b9bea6b8958ad078a.jpg"><br><br>  Two-day conference + a day of practical training.  The topics are quite expected: PHP and alternative platforms, architecture, frontend, teamwork. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.phpconference.nl/prepare-call-papers">Applications from speakers</a> will be accepted from January 08.  The Speaker is paid for travel and hotel. <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : There is no exact information yet.  In the past, tickets cost quite humanely - about ‚Ç¨ 300- ‚Ç¨ 350 (only the conference, without practical training). <br><br><h4>  11. JavaOne, San Francisco, September 18-22 </h4>  <a href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eaf/911/793/eaf911793c9d4a5b9d455489e518e128.jpg"><br><br>  A five-day Java conference.  6 streams, a lot of practical training. <br>  Applications from speakers will be accepted from the end of March. <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : Registration for the conference 2016 is not yet open.  In the past, tickets were worth $ 1,850 - details <a href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/register/index.html">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  12. Web Summit, Lisbon, November 07-10 </h4>  <a href="https://websummit.net/">websummit.net</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d5/69f/62f/3d569f62fee4453a841e99d5fa42730c.jpg"><br><br>  In 2015, this action took place in Dublin.  The scale is impressive: 1000 speakers, 42 thousand participants.  A lot of stands of different companies, a lot of startups.  We performed CTO Facebook, Co-Founder Instagram, Yandex CEO and many others.  The conference program is divided into subprograms ‚Äî summits: Code Summit, Data Summit, Design Summit, Enterprise Summit, and others ‚Äî about 20 in total. Tracks are highlighted within each Summit.  For example, Code Summit tracks: DevOps, Data &amp; Databases, Cloud, Web Development, Server Side, Frontend, Mobile. <br><br>  I think it‚Äôs realistic to speak here (the organizers need to find 1000 speakers!) - we leave a request <a href="https://websummit.net/speakers-application">here</a> and wait for an answer. <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : tickets are not yet sold and the exact price is unknown.  For now they offer to register for a promotion <a href="https://websummit.net/2for1">2 tickets for the price of 1</a> .  It seems like 500 sets are periodically thrown away (‚Ç¨ 600 for 2 tickets) and snapped up within 15 minutes.  Register and catch the moment! <br><br>  Last year tickets cost up to ‚Ç¨ 1,618 - the later you register, the more you pay. <br><hr><br>  It will be interesting to hear your opinion about these conferences, if you have already attended them in past years.  And add to the list of interesting events in the comments! <br><br>  Sources: <br>  <a href="http://www.softdevconferences.com/">www.softdevconferences.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://lanyrd.com/">lanyrd.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://10times.com/computer/conferences">10times.com/computer/conferences</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/274177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/274177/</a></p>
