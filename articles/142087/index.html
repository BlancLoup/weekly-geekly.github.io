I think that each of us was faced with the fact that revival is different.  There are days when you get up, do everything on autopilot, your head is empty, and in your soul there is hatred for the whole Universe and humanity.  On such days there are the hardest morning hours: the work in the morning does not go at all, it's empty in my head, I don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone, but even to see.  And there are very different days.  These days you get up easily, the brain starts working right away, things are arguing in the morning. <br><br>  By nature, I am a typical "owl" and, like for many "owls," morning for me is, let's say, not a very pleasant time of day.  Once, after another heavy awakening, I, sitting at work, and flipping through the Internet with a cup of coffee in my hand, trying to come to my senses, thought: ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs enough already to suffer?  Maybe it's time to do something? ‚ÄùI figured that when I wake up in a zombie state, I lose a couple of hours of time to tune in to the working mood (I specifically came to work an hour earlier, to be more or less in shape), plus the mood in the morning affects how my day goes.  So I began to look for a solution to the problem of my heavy awakening. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I once heard that there are alarm clocks that react to the human sleep phase and allow you to wake him up at the most appropriate time.  After spending some time searching the Internet, I found that there are not only stand-alone gadgets, but also programs for mobile phones.  I dismissed the program immediately.  I am a conservative person and I think that every task should have its own gadget.  The phone should ring, the camera should take pictures, and the alarm should wake up, and if everything is gathered in one place, then, as a result, having everything, you will not receive what you expected.  But, oh well, there is no arguing about tastes ... So, rummaging through the Internet, I found the Axbo alarm clock <a href="http://www.axbo.com/">(the official site is www.axbo.com)</a> .  Naturally, before buying, I wanted to read reviews about it.  After spending a couple of days looking for reviews in various forums, I realized that the alarm clock seemed to be working.  As you noticed the key phrase "like".  No, it really works, but at the time when I was looking for information, I did not meet a single normal description or review.  This was the reason that I am writing this text.  I hope that my review will help someone save time when searching for information and learn more about this alarm clock.

      So let's get started.  I think that many have heard about the phases of sleep.  In short, during the night there is a change of phases of fast and slow sleep.  It is easiest to wake up during the fast sleep phase.  During REM sleep, we move, to which various ‚Äúsmart‚Äù alarm clocks react. <br><br>  Having received a package with an alarm clock, I opened the box.  Inside was the alarm clock itself, two double bracelets of different sizes on the wrist, a sensor that responds to movement, a USB cable and a power supply.  The alarm clock is powered by batteries inside and needs to be recharged about once every three weeks.  The appearance of the alarm can be seen in the photo. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b9b/704/f75/b9b704f75468aa1c5714570fb19351ea.jpg" alt="Appearance"><br>  <i>Appearance.</i>  <i>Alarm clock bracelet and sensor that is inserted into the bracelet</i> <br><br>  All settings are made using two buttons and a wheel, which are located on one of the corners of the device.  Somewhat familiar, like the design itself, but oh well.  The motion sensor is inserted into the bracelet and is put on a weak hand during sleep (the left of the right-handed one and vice versa).  During sleep, when we sleep, the sensor transmits motion data to the alarm clock.  With the help of software, which can be downloaded on the official website, you can unload the sleep history in the form of diagrams from the alarm clock, which can be seen when the person falls asleep, when he tossed and turned in his sleep, the time of waking up.  In my opinion, this information does not carry much value. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd9/9fc/ff8/bd99fcff883daf5efb54a81b73efe6ad.png" alt="Movement in a dream"><br>  <i>An example of a chart that can be unloaded from the alarm clock.</i>  <i>Gray field is a dream, green is a 30-minute window for waking up.</i> <br><br>  Next, putting on a bracelet on your hand, set an extreme moment of awakening on the alarm clock.  The alarm clock has a time reserve of 30 minutes, that is, if you set the wake up time at 7 am, it will wake you up from 6:30 am to 7:00 am with a pleasant melody (selected from several set ones), choosing the best moment to wake up the gap.  You ask, what if this moment does not fall into the 30-minute window?  In this case, the alarm will wake you up at the extreme moment (the one you set the day before) with a sharp signal.  You can turn off the alarm by pressing a button on the alarm clock, or by pressing a button on the bracelet. <br><br>  Go ahead.  This alarm has the function of "falling asleep."  Before bedtime, you can turn on the soothing noise, under which you can fall asleep.  It is also selected from those available in the device.  I usually choose crickets or the sound of the sea.  When you fall asleep, the melody is turned off. <br><br>  Does the bracelet on the hand interfere?  Not.  At first it was not unusual to feel something on the wrist, but after a couple of days I got used to it.  The bracelet is quite soft and pleasant to the touch. <br><br>  Now for the sensations.  I write this review after half a year of using the device, so I can say that the effect of auto-suggestion is unlikely to be the case.  The first two weeks of using the alarm clock was dull and often woke me up at the last moment.  This is normal, because  the instructions say that at first he adapts to a particular person.  Then the number of "emergency" wakes was reduced to 1-2 per month. <br><br>  After six months of use, I can say that the alarm really works.  The feeling of awakening can be compared with swimming under water.  Before this alarm clock, when the signal often pulled me out of the depths of sleep, I came to my senses for a long time, collected my thoughts, my mood was terrible in the morning.  It was very difficult to force myself to work and communicate with people.  I seemed to pop up sharply from the bottom of the pool, and then came to my senses for a long time. <br><br>  Now getting up has become easier.  The feeling is that when I wake up, I am almost on the surface of the pool, lift my head a little, breathe in the air and go ashore.  I often remember the dream I had.  Feeling as if stepped out of the reality of sleep into ours and keep moving.  The brain almost always works immediately after waking up, but the body sometimes resists and asks for "another five minutes" of sleep.  Now it takes me 20-30 minutes to get into working condition, after which I can work normally.  Remember those moments when you woke up easily and you understand what I'm talking about. <br><br>  Conclusion: <br>  The alarm clock really works.  After the start of its regular use, getting up became easier, it takes significantly less time to get yourself up and running and start the day.  The alarm does not solve sleep problems and will not help you sleep less than your body requires; therefore, you need to follow the sleep regimen.  Everyone makes a choice himself, whether or not to use such devices, but it seems to me that it is worth using them, since our morning greatly influences the next day, and if you are awake, you can do much more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142087/</a></p>
