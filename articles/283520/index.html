But JPoint 2016 showed: there is much.  The conference turned out to be so large-scale that even the processing of photos from it took a lot of time (so our text was late so that Habr√© had a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/282810">review by the eyes of a participant</a> from <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dbelob/" class="user_link">dbelob</a> ).  Under the cut - all the details about how it was. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14c/011/d0e/14c011d0e4cd4b77a0e8021ddb3a4b7a.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <br>
      <b>First day</b> <br><br>  The first difference was immediately apparent when looking at the program: unlike last year, the new JPoint was a two-day one.  At the same time, he did not lose in the number of halls, and the essential topics were not diluted with random ‚Äúwater‚Äù from unknown speakers: in general, the same, but thicker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a6/db9/d8b/6a6db9d8bd234d1b8a96830a868c2592.jpg"><br><br>  A couple of surprises were also found in the lobby: an attraction using the Oculus Rift and a robot Fedya.  Driving around the newcomers, Fedya started a conversation with them, and the result was a Turing tacit test: the interlocutors tried to understand by his remarks, a live operator pronounces them or generates an algorithm.  However, it was easy to guess, because the cars had not really learned how to joke, and Fedya did it all the time, causing a lot of smiles during the day.  But the fact that the most sociable participant in the conference turned out to be a piece of iron driving across the floor already shows in itself: the future can be considered to have come. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/870/d4d/130/870d4d13064c4908bb916fea7ae5496d.jpg"><br><br>  The opening keynote was also different from what can usually be seen.  The leading podcast <a href="http://razbor-poletov.com/">‚ÄúDebriefing‚Äù</a> was responsible for him, and instead of the speech of one speaker here, as in the recent viral video about Hamlet‚Äôs monologue, a number of people familiar to many in the audience appeared on the scene: <b>Baruch Sadogursky, Victor Gamov, Kirill Tolkachev, Anton Arkhipov, Alexey Abashev</b> and <b>Anton Chernousov</b> .  Briskly following the current trends of the Java world and mentioning the reports related to these trends in the JPoint program, they finally included a video with the well-known replica of Steve Ballmer "Developers, developers, developers, developers".  The logical choice: only Ballmer can compare with Baruch in volume. <br><br>  Then everyone went on different tracks.  While the main stage was taken by <b>Vladimir Krasilshchik (Luxoft)</b> with a logging report (debuted in March <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/280462/">at Novosibirsk JBreak</a> ), <b>Dmitry Chuyko (Oracle)</b> campaigned in the fourth hall already now to try the ninth version of Java (with the words ‚Äúeverything will break, but repair is simple‚Äù) and written Java compiler <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/overview/index.html">Graal</a> (with the words "it is not so experimental as to be bad"). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/982/b7c/2cc/982b7c2cc495459ebf5c764ca3faf2b9.jpg"><br><br>  It was replaced by <b>Dmitry Zhemerov (JetBrains)</b> with the report ‚ÄúOh, the cat ran: Compilation and code performance on Kotlin‚Äù.  Only a couple of months ago, this language finally reached version 1.0, and now the report is about supporting the capabilities of Java 8, planned in 1.1.  There was no release date for the new version (with a good reason "about output 1.0, we said a lot of things, and in the end it somehow turned out badly"), but the cat stated in the title really figured.  Between the hardcore slides of the JMH benchmarks, Dmitri showed a video where his cat unfolds in three steps as he walks through furniture.  Another nice detail of the report was the use of the number ‚Äú239‚Äù in the example code: from this one could guess that the speaker was from St. Petersburg, where the physics and mathematics lyceum with this number plays a crucial role in the technical community. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c45/bc2/2df/c45bc22df9a34565b3a1e5eee56f2ff0.jpg"><br><br>  Then, <b>Ruslan Cheremin</b> from <b>Deutsche Bank</b> spoke in the same room with the topic ‚ÄúEscape Analysis and Scalar Replacement‚Äù, telling things that could not be done - or rather, a blog entry of Ruslan Cheremin himself, partially overlapping with the report.  Which code fragments will turn out to be scalarized, and which ones will not ‚Äî an unobvious thing and not painted on the Internet in detail; therefore, Cheremin independently dealt with it by trial and error, as with a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù, and at the conference shared a rare experience.  As he said himself, ‚Äúit was more interesting than asking Shipilev‚Äù - but in the end, the same Shipilev was sitting on this report, perhaps learning something new for himself.  After all, there may be at least something in Java that Shipilev doesn‚Äôt know, right? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f1/382/520/6f1382520b32471a975f0a4d66751a3c.jpg"><br><br>  Meanwhile, in the main hall of <b>Oleg Anastasiev (‚ÄúClassmates‚Äù)</b> , who spoke about distributed systems, three speakers changed at once, and the real show began.  It was decided to compare which assembly tool is better and what, in the form of a battle: <b>Yevgeny Borisov</b> , <b>Baruh Sadogursky</b> and <b>Anton Arkhipov</b> tried to cope with a number of tasks in Maven, Gradle and SBT, respectively, measuring the result with audience applause.  This was accompanied by so many sarcastic replicas of each other that rap battles could envy.  As a result, while Maven and Gradle fought hard, Arkhipov often acknowledged that SBT lacked adequate opportunities - but generous viewers clapped him the loudest so that he would not get upset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab0/5f3/022/ab05f30222d74194a7a6a0d4d0f43237.jpg"><br><br>  After that, the main technical problem of the conference occurred: when <b>Aleksey Shipilev (Oracle)</b> came out to tell us how to live after leaving sun.misc.Unsafe, the screen in the main hall did not want to show anything.  In the case of some other speaker, this could mean fifteen minutes of intense silence, but not with Shipilev: during the elimination of the problem, he managed to utter many memorable phrases like ‚Äúthe most difficult thing with Unsafe is to talk about it so as not to cause people desire to use it. ‚Äù  But he didn‚Äôt want to start the report without slides, and when everything worked, it became clear why: it would be a crime to leave the hall, for example, without such a picture that caused a friendly laugh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c18/fe6/c1f/c18fe6c1f9a84cbcbd162af153ab51fe.jpg"><br><br>  And then, after closing the first day of the keynote from Maxim Dorofeyev, followed by the continuation of the banquet: a party at the club StereoHall.  There, the <a href="http://razbor-poletov.com/2016/04/episode-108.html">release of the</a> podcast ‚ÄúDebriefing‚Äù was recorded right before the eyes of the public, so that all who wished could ask the moderators (‚ÄúHow many Scala programmers do you need to make a Java project?‚Äù - ‚ÄúUsually one was enough‚Äù).  And then came Animal Jazz band, songs like ‚ÄúThree Stripes‚Äù which returned them all to 2007: the JPoint visitors surely have a lot of nostalgic memories with those times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/394/d8f/74b/394d8f74b68e443cba637ec056d291fe.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Second day</b> <br><br>  The morning after a party at the club is not the best time to delve into the nuances of code optimization.  So the opening keynote of the second day was more widely available: <b>Evgenia Timonova</b> , known for her biological video blog ‚ÄúEverything is like animals,‚Äù talked about how people can be considered programmed.  The words ‚Äúsurprised eyebrows were raised ‚Äî an instinct peculiar to all people on the planet‚Äù from the audience objected, ‚Äúwhat about poker players?‚Äù And she said: ‚Äúyes, the brain can suppress this reaction to some extent‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2f/aca/763/b2faca763a75456a92080068379383a1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Sberbank Technologies,</b> who recently talked about the new Sberbank platform <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/280462/">on JBreak</a> , in this case occupied the whole room for a whole day in order to do this in as much detail as possible.  But this does not mean that other topics had to shrink: another room was allocated for Sbertech, besides those involved earlier.  That is, on the second day of the JPoint, the action took place simultaneously in <i>five</i> halls - and this is not counting the expert zones in the hall.  The question ‚Äúwhere to go on a bigger scale‚Äù found a completely direct answer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e0/35a/670/2e035a670f824a7c98f6a0d1ca3d05ad.jpg"><br><br>  Difficulties are coming up with such a scale - a year ago, a long queue for lunch turned into a hitch.  But this time it was decided to split the audience in half and spread the dinner on two different breaks, so the situation did not happen again.  In general, the reports on optimization of high-loaded systems are not in vain: we can say that the process that was executed for too long has been successfully parallelized.  When one half of those who came was at dinner, the other in a long break was something to do: in the lobby you could even thoroughly ask the speakers who had already left the scenes, even bypass the numerous stands of the participating companies, simultaneously charging Odnoklassniki with their gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8a/893/1ac/b8a8931ac2ed40a884e18a61fd268ab8.jpg"><br><br>  The slot ‚Äúbetween two dinners‚Äù could be called ‚ÄúSiberian‚Äù, because the two halls were simultaneously occupied by Novosibirsk: <b>Tagir Valeev</b> with a report about the Stream API and <b>Nikita Lipsky</b> , who spoke about Excelsior JET.  Not surprisingly, both of them performed at the JBreak in March (still, skip the main Java event at home), and it‚Äôs not surprising that both spoke about the same projects: Valeev is developing the <a href="https://github.com/amaembo/streamex">StreamEx</a> library that extends the capabilities of the Stream API, and Lipsky and completely made Excelsior JET a matter of his life.  However, this does not mean that the Novosibirsk and Moscow reports completely coincided with them: while at JBreak Valeev considered the Stream API from a practical point of view ‚Äúhow to achieve a certain result‚Äù, then at the JPoint the accents were shifted towards the theoretical ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/053/9d2/8e9/0539d28e9d9640b3b4c0b82ee512de8a.jpg"><br><br>  After Tagir, the main stage turned out to be ... the same Tagir, but already in the company of Baruch Sadogursky and Yevgeny Borisov.  According to the experience of the battle on the eve, it was immediately possible to assume that such a company meant a revival in the hall - and it happened.  A joint presentation with the theme ‚ÄúJava 8 Puzzlers‚Äù suggested that those present not only listen to the tricky nuances of Java, but personally break their brains over what result a particular code fragment would lead to, and only then find out the correct result.  As a result, excitement reigned in the hall: everyone was actively pulling their hands for one of the options, and then with interest they discovered how wrong they were. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc8/a69/44b/bc8a6944b2044d44ba8b72cbd7b1c786.jpg"><br><br>  Following in the fourth hall, a joint presentation also took place, in which two <b>Alexander</b> from <b>Oracle</b> - <b>Belokrylov and Mironenko</b> - spoke about the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù.  There was no such fun, but for people far from the topic there were enough curious, unobvious moments: from the fact that IoT can be used for remote diagnostics of devices like treadmills (we used to say that everyone calls the ‚Äúturn on the light bulb‚Äù) before that for it they use the XMPP protocol (we are used to the fact that it is used for messaging between real people, not devices). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79a/825/9fa/79a8259faf304a7483c96c20c45de43f.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, after <b>Shipilyov</b> 's story about java.lang.String in JDK 9, it was time for the final keyout - <b>Tim Berglund (DataStax)</b> spoke in English about what the developers could learn from the film industry.  It was obvious that in the cinema he understands no worse than in the development: examples varied from the first sound films (showing how the industry was not in a hurry to grab the new technology) to the recent Obsession ("they first made a short film there, and then developed it to Meter - this same lean filmmaking! ‚Äù).  Connoisseurs were also found among the spectators who knew that the Coen brothers (not the most famous work of theirs) shot ‚ÄúRaising Arizona‚Äù.  Although there was no code in this speech, it turned out to be a hardcore end of a hardcore conference: to listen in English about the technical side of another industry, remembering what can be wound on a mustache. <br><br>  Two days, five rooms, a party in the middle - the JPoint was clearly bigger than the previous one.  Can something even increase the scale?  Maybe: the next day after that there was also Student Day with presentations for beginners.  But about this - in a separate following text. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcc/a92/6b5/fcca926b5fc74372ad8193a028564d5e.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283520/</a></p>
