The second visit turned out to be more meaningful - it came to be understood that this is the case when the office is not a set of felting places and well-placed spot-feeders, but a combination of absolutely functional elements.  That is, not the bells and whistles and beauty (although it exists), but the real encyclopedia of usability of office space.  ‚Äú <i>And let's take a photo report from your office, this is both useful and interesting,</i> ‚Äù we suggested after the second meeting.  Well, where is the second, and there is the third - and two people (as part of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Boomburum</a> +1) from our TM team went to Avito to listen, ask around, take pictures.  It turned out more interesting than we could expect.  And yes, there is not a single shot in the report. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e04/07a/788/e0407a78861f6f9a4e6fb474fd19c676.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was on July 5th, the heat finally penetrated into Moscow for some few hours, and I really wanted to get out of the subway and breathe the conditioned coolness.  Fortunately, the coolness was within reach.  Directly opposite the Belarusian metropolitan sky metro station, the skyscrapers of two business centers were squeezed in - from a noisy square with a fountain, a bunch of cafe-restaurants and even a gas station you find yourself in an office realm.  We are in the fact that on the right - a luxurious glass building. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c59/d09/50b/c59d0950b8ff26d7bed3585e52c67d7c.jpg">

      Inside the huge elevators with a cunning system of entering the floor on a separate scoreboard.  Rrraz - and we at the reception Avito.  We are met by the already old friend Mikhail Klyuev, DevRel, and a new employee of his unit, Antonina.  An excellent tandem: be sure to talk separately with Tonya to ask what she, the newcomer, is here.  Let's go? <br><br><h2>  Avito: meeting place </h2><br>  Avito occupies four floors, each of which is made in a specific theme, but at the same time a uniform style and philosophy of the organization of space can be traced.  Let's start with the general, and then go on a visit to the developers.  We leave for the 15th ‚Äúpublic‚Äù floor, with which all those who come for business, get acquainted for an interview, or decide to visit one of the many Avito meetings, meet. <br><br>  Did you see the word Avito in this wall? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb0/9f7/e48/cb09f7e48d5f1efa96c6291b4490baba.jpg"><br><br>  The schedule at the meeting rooms on all floors is not just a formality, but part of the rules.  These are comfortable ascetic rooms with all the necessary equipment and furniture.  At the entrance to each meeting room there is a touch panel that allows you to view the list and the time of bookings, change it, notify your colleagues that the room was vacant earlier than expected.  Such severity is a necessary measure: teams constantly hold meetings, meetings, short meetings in order to solve operational issues quickly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76b/50d/7b7/76b50d7b774791f29af4f14d0d671b1c.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, on this floor all the meeting rooms are named after Swedish islands: for example, Kungsholmen, Gamla Stan, S√∂dermalm.  This is due to the fact that the two founders of Avito are Swedes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad8/a88/b59/ad8a88b59d2b71ebd7ff79467d2f1d7e.jpg"><br><br>  Negotiations here seem relatively small, but this is a very deceptive impression: during the meetings, they are transformed into one big hall for 200 people.  Listeners become available 3-4 screens on which you can display information from the projector.  This is despite the fact that you will never find these screens during working hours - as if they are not there, as well as a huge hall. <br><br>  And here it is - lifting tables on winches.  At the right moment, they soar up to the ceiling and free up space for the mitap, hakaton, conference, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b31/6c9/b08/b316c9b085716ac74680d26b1031e5e9.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Pay attention to the blocks under the ceiling - with their help, tables can be raised up and free up space</font></i> <br><br>  On the same floor is a dining room.  However, if it were open to all, it would have gained fame as a good urban cafe with excellent panoramic views.  We will talk about views separately, they clearly deserve it.  In the meantime, let us return to the daily food: the staff has free lunches, fruit snacks, light snacks, sandwiches for dinner every weekday and breakfasts on Fridays. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa9/11a/493/fa911a49395ebfffb3450456d52b4114.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Meals are free, but lunch is lunch and accounting is by account.</font></i> <br><br>  Back in January 2016, food was brought in containers.  Warming her in microwaves.  Now food is fresh, hot, aromatic.  It is noteworthy that in the dining room there is a flipchart with sheets of paper, where the date and comments of employees about the quality and taste of the dishes are written.  Someone praises, someone criticizes or makes a remark about the bones found, cooking, etc.  Even such little things are thought out, and this can not catch the attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/193/28b/17d/19328b17d9e4cf73572d47d6d46a6148.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Picky what!</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">That bone in the olives, the gazpacho failed ...</font></i> <br><br>  By the way, in the same dining room on Fridays themed parties are held.  For example, recently there were watching football matches on the big screen (manage <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/avito">to get settled in Avito</a> before the 2018 World Cup).  And on the eve of our arrival there was a Mexican party, with a sombrero and Mexican beer.  Not really.  Well, or yes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ba/af4/6cf/1baaf46cfa2b577b3428880d90e4e319.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">This is the ceiling in the dining room - every sea scum</font></i> <br><br>  Opposite the mournful flip chart stands a board with a schedule of non-technical internal training for Avito employees.  Training is conducted by the Training &amp; Development department under the motto: ‚ÄúTrain your brain!‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b85/a97/a71/b85a97a71171d380de6858d52cbde05b.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">How to effectively disperse brains</font></i> <br><br>  It is aimed at the development of soft-skills, training of thinking, development of creativity.  The directions of development are chosen by the employees themselves, participation in trainings is voluntary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28d/c2e/7c8/28dc2e7c88da1b2080cf7ba42d542c74.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">‚ÄúHow to convey your thoughts‚Äù, ‚ÄúEffective leader‚Äù, ‚ÄúPublic speaking skills‚Äù, etc.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Everything you need and without water.</font></i> <br><br>  Well, once we relaxed, then before going to the developers floor, let's talk about fun and about beauty.  Fun is corporate parties.  In Avito, employees are spared from tedious gatherings with custom-made hosts.  Events are held in the office with beer, pizza, burgers and entertainment, including traditional for the company: board games and Mafia.  Among the old-timers there is a legend about the first corporate party in the new office in Belarus.  One of the floors before the repair was sad concrete blocks.  Employees painted his graffiti and staged the coolest party.  And since there were few employees, they called guests from the street - as a result, a queue gathered around the business center to see what was so funny and interesting at the top.  In the summer there are corporate trips. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/396/52d/65c/39652d65cca22d5246e771c3b1388a80.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">This place is dizzy</font></i> <br><br>  Now about the beautiful.  These are the views from the panoramic windows and from the numerous verandas around the office (with wicker furniture, flower beds and a mini-pond, but without a hookah and a smoking room - all of the healthy lifestyles and the rocking chair). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b0/d1b/6a3/0b0d1b6a3e8424898e4bf7fcfe1585ba.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc9/cef/c6e/fc9cefc6ed3c83339d11debbc5b3879a.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The pond is on the right, next to the blue ball.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Misha claims that so far no one has fallen into him.</font></i> <br><br>  One can see almost all the classic, beautiful Moscow: from the Ostankino Tower to the Ivan the Great Bell Tower.  During the May 9th parade, all aviation flies over the roof of the business center, so on this day there are always many employees in the office.  However, in the office there are people in 24/7 mode - many prefer to spend the weekend in the office.  Of course, solving their personal, not working tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68e/a69/2e8/68ea692e88dfd264f0b053ab903135db.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Eh, what a beauty!</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Lepote!</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Ivan Vasilyevich would approve.</font></i> <br><br>  From the windows you can see the high-rise of the weapons and weapons complex at Novoslobodskaya.  At first it was built with a flat top floor, but then it was decided to finish it.  The guys from Avito, who know how to make cool timelaps, set up a camera and filmed the process of building a spire.  Now the video is in post-production, here is a small fragment of the source material: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mKHSb9TOYFw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In order to move faster between floors, the former Avito CTO offered to make a pole (as in firefighters and in Ghostbusters).  But the owners of the business center protested, and this idea (one of the few) remained unfulfilled.  But the office and without such wow-stairs annually wins corporate space competitions in different nominations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57b/9cd/485/57b9cd4850f5e91853a26b634f6a2aab.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Present usability of office space</font></i> <br><br>  The developers floor (14th) is decorated in a rustic style and is called Avito Village.  Here, meeting rooms with the same strict rules are named after constellations: Sirius, Vega, Altair, etc.  The natural atmosphere is maintained in all the details of the interior - for example, there are seats in the form of sheep. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b4/a17/642/9b4a1764296ef10bb1a9c17baa418241.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f84/332/9a8/f843329a869795ce024ab5294c706cae.jpg"><br><br>  It's time to talk about how to get into Avito.  The peculiarity of the company is that it is very difficult for a junior to get a job in the development team, the middles have more chances.  In general, the need for personnel in Avito is always there, as the company is actively growing and developing.  Constantly we need talented and smart heads: engineers, product managers, quality specialists, databases, mobile developers.  The company expects to see highly qualified specialists who are well able to do their work, responsibly approach it, want to develop a product or some specific technology within the company.  It should be people who can friendly, structured, constructively discuss issues, problems, offer their solutions.  In general, initiative and professional are not so many requirements for cool work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ce/748/176/8ce74817659e59fa4524f160ad8f6438.jpg"><br><br>  Adaptation of new employees is painless and almost imperceptible (recently working Tonya confirmed that she seemed to always work here).  There is an incubator system: a new employee deals with professional questions with a mentor assigned to him, and asks difficult questions to HR staff.  By the time of the full-fledged start, the employee is already systematically joining the team.  This is largely due to the adaptation plan, which excludes unpredictable movements and force majeure.  And how not to join when there are holes in the office? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c4/fc3/e00/7c4fc3e00d7e4cdfbdb4f84508eabc64.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Legendary holes ...</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d59/422/2f2/d594222f268ba2567fac4780b78886ce.jpg"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">... and their inhabitants</font></i> <br><br>  In general, the staff here are treated with great respect and care: they can arrange the workplace to their own taste, everywhere there is something that binds the team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69b/ea7/dab/69bea7dab97faf1f2ae05cf73914323a.jpg"><br><br>  So, for example, this meeting room was painted by designers according to this principle: everyone called what he wanted to see on its walls, and the artist did a sketch or an inscription.  Here is such a diverse, but single portrait of the team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/407/a53/1fe/407a531fe8ba83d2765137898b9e9f10.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Negotiation with graffiti, similar to the garage.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Cozy inside</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ae/8a4/d94/0ae8a4d94ddda65a311692562aa96ac7.jpg"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Look at the pictures closer - they are cool.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Especially the rays of good and the snail-biceps please</font></i> <br><br>  Two more signs of reverent attitude to people: puzzles with the faces of employees everywhere and paintings on the walls.  Puzzles are a legacy from the old wall: when a newcomer came to work, his photo became one puzzle in the big picture, and he became a member of a cohesive team.  Pictures hanging in the openings between the windows were painted by the employees themselves several years ago during team building in Morocco.  Then the Avito team was still quite small, and it could afford. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb6/9d2/ca8/cb69d2ca8424b50a28d95e1950a7ed3d.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">One of these paintings</font></i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51b/6c8/f89/51b6c8f893d3699b2df18ec21294036c.jpg"></i> <br><br>  The columns inside the halls are wrapped with ropes in the manner of the ships, but we were more reminded of giant claws.  However, there are no giant cats or even ordinary cats in the office, but people are not the only living creatures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/adb/ea6/519/adbea65191bb810274fb5327e1e26d6b.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">On the day we were at Avito's office, these same boxes were collecting presents for orphanages from children to school - kindness will definitely save this world.</font></i> <br><br>  So, some time ago, canaries were brought to the office in a huge spacious cage.  At first they were shocked, were silent and delighted the eye, but very soon they got accustomed and began to please the ear first, and then simply interfere with the work of their trills.  Birds were attached, from living creatures chose quieter fish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b3/c2d/26a/5b3c2d26a31d7098180bc96de99c428b.jpg"><br><br>  Some employees keep their fish, snails or turtles on their tables, some time ago even a tarantula lived with one girl - he was cute and ate cockroaches, but was moved home to the owner because of particularly impressionable colleagues with advanced arachnophobia.  Even in Avito, they wanted to have a robo-cat, but the internal crowdfunding campaign to raise money for the robot is still frozen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/130/117/b6a/130117b6a785b41f16b9d85ba91b94c7.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Android smoker in the same cell in which they lived noisy canaries</font></i> <br><br>  The canary cage took a cardboard Android - not that he was punished or the Avito employees didn‚Äôt have sympathy for him, just in the office there is a bad copy and a good one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/925/3e4/d4c/9253e4d4cfbfe7546c587b5cf2741574.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Android healthy person</font></i> <br><br>  In general, Avito like to combine, try, choose and apply the most modern technologies.  For example, along with PHP, Kotlin, Swift, Python, Go are actively used ... You can read about the part of technologies used in the development in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/avito/blog/321796/">first Avito post on Habr√©</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0a/967/d7f/d0a967d7f08659893987521b7a70fa72.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The table of Egor Tolstoy and the implementation of the Rubber duck debugging method</font></i> <br><br>  At that moment, our hearts stopped: the cabinets at the exit from the floor were filled with unlimited power engineers.  Somehow the wardrobe looks like a dream of a tired and mentally overstrained employee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31b/86f/4b7/31b86f4b7779625bd346c8c0e4299164.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Probably, this is my paradise ...) Boomburum</font></i> <br><br>  At the very exit there is a small guitar-billiard-massage room for meditating solitude and afterparty corporate parties.  Because of the poor sound insulation like this on a weekday, a cool solyak will not work - they will be resettled to the canaries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/adc/689/ace/adc689ace1a3af59cbbfff4258794508.jpg"><br><br>  And ... look up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/610/eef/bd1/610eefbd19663cf56267982e125a59d8.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">In the grid-ceiling hides the fruit moulages, this is not a drawing</font></i> <br><br>  The chip of this floor (and also the 13th), to which we could not remain indifferent, is the shelves with books on design, layout, programming, project management, administration, etc.  These are the best samples, all the classics in one place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd9/ed4/283/fd9ed42837fbe66e13d6bfea2c300d93.jpg"><br><br>  It turns out that the company has a Slack channel in which you can discuss the books or clarify what is there with the queue for them.  And after the probation period, all employees receive a subscription to the electronic library of the publishing house MIF and the right to ask to buy any book necessary for work, including English-language publications from Amazon. <br><br>  Meanwhile, we walked on the verandas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a2/032/cb0/9a2032cb048fc7eaaad15a6d6c692b8d.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Developer League Yacht Club </h2><br>  And went to the floor of the yacht.  Here everything is very thematically and interesting.  It is on this floor that there are those most amazing capsule-holes in which introverts live (and all the rest - cabins are in great demand). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ce/a92/deb/4cea92deb8fd0ea4f3e116046e6f10ab.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/935/0b7/de8/9350b7de8ca813896358555eaaadc53b.jpg"><br><br>  The whole floor is decorated in a maritime theme and consists of large open space (cozy, with partitions and table lamps), halls, small halls, meeting rooms and very small dedicated spaces for solitary concentrated work or private conversation on the phone, skype, eye to eye. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffc/e90/db2/ffce90db280f68217b0c8fc7f8c1a376.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Open space that looks cozy.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">By the way, the office is quiet</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1bb/366/edd/1bb366edd30477309f8f05a11e06b02f.jpg"></font></i> <br><br>  There are a lot of cozy, soft, informal and private niche-room cells around the main space, in the corridors (there is no turning their tongues like that), in which you can retire and work for some time.  There are even real beds with ladders to them - after a successful commit, graduation and any other work you can sleep.  Well, or, even better, work while lying with a laptop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/488/714/76c/48871476c091b8bc960c71a5421ecda6.jpg"><br><br>  In the analytics openspace there is such a board with tasks.  Do you know what they call it?  Board procrastination.  What kind of employees, such procrastination - analysts in the team are also exceptionally professional. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d51/f99/641/d51f99641995fe8f459ed6f39ed03098.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Did you solve these problems?</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Write the answers and solutions in the comments!</font></i> <br><br>  Not far from analysts, there is an inviting transforming sofa, which you cannot walk past so as not to touch or sit down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/630/4db/634/6304db6345d0d4d40cc747522c419519.jpg"><br><br>  There's also a chessboard - another office entertainment in Avito.  And again the intellectual and useful.  Obviously, the whole team likes to keep the brain in good shape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ed/0fc/fa2/6ed0fcfa2b5669d9cd7e02a81a901e3e.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Time to play a game</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e8/af3/4ae/9e8af34ae41f1f047219bf71d4eb8ada.jpg"><br><br>  Meeting rooms on this floor are named after the Russian islands: Kizhi, Fr.  Wrangel, Kotlin, Valaam, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f7/244/2f2/7f72442f2ae0df2818c294b2ef68dafe.jpg"><br><br>  They are a little different from the previous ones - in two of them there are psychedelic walls that you can't look at for a long time.  In fact, these are simply made in a special way grids, which, with a long look, cause the effect of optical illusion.  Whether such hypnothenes were conceived on purpose is unknown.  But it seems that this is just a coincidence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/955/5b5/785/9555b5785ac815c0f013932fb38c1bfa.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Not exactly the same psychedelic conversation, but also with an interesting interior.</font></i> <br><br>  In the QA Automation unit, the column is symbolically located, upholstered in soft thick material - so that you can safely beat your head.  Needless to say, the guys from this unit need constant psychological support.  Joking <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7de/727/a35/7de727a3517e00552e6576f847a8049f.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Everyone saw the inscription "Do not forget to suffer"?</font></i> <br><br>  In fact, Avito employees are very enthusiastic people.  We, as ardent fans of Geektimes and all sorts of gadgets there, noticed on one of the tables a drone DJI Phantom.  To our question, Misha calmly replied that the guy leads a very cool account with aerial photography to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/craving/">Instagram</a> .  ‚ÄúAnd this is the table of Yegor Tolstoy,‚Äù Mikhail casually shows.  And we know how famous Yegor is in IT circles and how special he is in iOS development.  Or, for example, developers (not security people!) Have created their own team and are engaged in the study of CTF.  However, the degree of enthusiasm can be judged even by the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/avito/blog/325632/">posts of the</a> guys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d06/653/7e0/d066537e077596d99ad7370b9e6ba4b4.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Technology areas </h2><br>  Avito has many small divisions - a unit system.  Many employees are distributed across cross-functional teams for effective communication.  This structure is due to the fact that the ad site itself is the tip of the iceberg of development.  Few people know, but Avito, for example, also creates pro tools - tools for professional market participants, for example, realtors. <br><br>  By the way, Avito loves open-source.  In the last year, the guys began to lay out their work - they regularly commit: there were requests to well-known open source projects.  Avito is a big project whose mission is to grow and flourish.  If you use some kind of closed technology and integrate it quite deeply into the work, and there will be some problems with it, you can simply lose the speed of reaction to the problems.  With open-source, you can fix and send the request, and here and now it will work well.  And with closed technologies it can not be done.  So love is clearly not accidental. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/118/531/883/118531883d04319c6a37bfe0f7e44719.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Such heaps of stickers and badges can be found on many tables - employees participate in various conferences.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">By the way, at the RIT ++ 2017 festival Avito had its own <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/avito/blog/331418/">separate conference flow on microservices</a></font></i> <br><br>  Only the CEO has his own private office (albeit with transparent walls) in Avito.  But he does not use it either - it works in the openspace.  And the cabinet is used by employees as a meeting room for meetings and rallies, and, sometimes, for meetings with the CEO himself - in the photo we caught a rare moment when the director was in the office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd5/fe4/f94/bd5fe4f942f790900878310a8e42d74e.jpg"><br><br>  Before you go to the last of the floors belonging to Avito, go to the gym.  In fact, there are two of them in the office - one is cardio, <s>for fitons</s> , the other is power.  Each floor has a shower, and each of the rooms - locker rooms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf9/fbe/d7c/cf9fbed7c9000a6eca20f01e1f08fd12.jpg"><br><br>  In the power room is the most intimate room Avito - a tiny office with a massage chair and a sign "Do not disturb."  Hussars, silent! <br><br><h2>  Solar system and things with Avito </h2><br>  On the last of the investigated floors, the 13th, negotiation rooms are named after the space objects of the Solar System: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, Uranus, Pluto and the Sun.  Vintage floor lamps, bedside tables, armchairs, chairs (inside diamonds, we are sure), intricate antique figures are striking.  This set seduces with its antiquity and luxury, but clearly falls out of the style of the whole office.  And on no less vintage couch as if nothing had happened staff are sitting.  The solution was simple, but remarkable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c89/dd0/2f6/c89dd02f60533705c7b7ca67b5555d90.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Purchased by Avito</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71c/405/337/71c405337f423d62a808ffd3086c8e79.jpg"><br><br>  The fact is that the first interior items for the office were purchased ... at Avito.  Therefore, the most unusual and eye-catching was chosen.  Then the design of such furniture became difficult from the point of view of financial statements and the idea was gradually abandoned.  But the <s>Scythian gold</s> heritage and memory remained. ,          ‚Äî ,         ¬´¬ª. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/773/c00/268/773c002688af6ee8b2474a185e071b9e.jpg"><br><br>  500  ,   ,  .       ,   ‚Äî    . <br><br> ,   ,       .  2015     Avito    Naspers,         .   ,                :         - .
