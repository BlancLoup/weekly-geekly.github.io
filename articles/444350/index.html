  <section class="page js-page"><h1>For some reason, MVP does not start (minimally viable product)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On a warm autumn morning in the center of Moscow, near the entrance to the gray skyscraper, a well-dressed man was walking nervously.  He was wearing an immaculate suit, an expensive tie, and flawless red Italian shoes. <br><br>  It was the general director, and he was waiting for the delegation checking on the IT enterprise entrusted to him.  The straightening, short haircut of graying hair and steel-giving look - successfully complemented the image. <br><br>  The delegation was late, and the Gender demandingly looked at his companion.  He was distinguished by an elusive look, a gray appearance, as if spreading in the air, and responded to the appeal ‚ÄúColonel‚Äù, and better - ‚ÄúMr. Colonel‚Äù.  For he was from where the colonels remain forever. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The colonel on the radio interviewed the posts on the possible route.

      Finally he blinked: the Maybachs were spotted two minutes from the office. <br><br>  Gendru was to show the delegation. <br><br>  As it should be in the theater - he started with a hanger.  From the locker room. <br><br>  Gray to the floor growth cabinets stored outerwear developers, testers and system analysts ... <br><br>  A stand with boxes for mobile phones and other personnel electronics was arranged separately.  Opposite the stand sat a concentrated guard with accounting books.  He had a serious task: to provide personnel with access to the mobile network no more than twice a day and for no more than 5 minutes, or more often upon presentation of a specially designed requirement. <br><br>  The delegation followed further - in a huge open-space. <br><br>  Smooth tables, distant, neat rows of monitors, a hundred people at clean tables, publishing only a keyboard reset and mouse clicks. <br><br>  It was a beautiful sight: hundreds of workers in gray or blue suits, with neat haircuts, were looking intently at the screens.  All monitors are turned to the aisle, panoramic windows cover the blinds - nothing distracts: neither the sunrise, nor the night. <br><br>  The delegation was impressed: in this huge Zadeh, where, it seems, everyone breathed in and out in unison, was born right now, in front of them, a unique innovative IT solution ... <br><br>  But suddenly!  one place turned out to be free: the table was, but no one sat behind it!  Gendir chewed his lips and glanced at the colonel - he briefly threw into the walkie-talkie: ‚Äúseat 72, code 15‚Äù. <br><br>  The delegation passed a zonchik with a small female part of the staff: white top, black bottom, natural make-up and low heels - everything was verified in this company.  Gendru was pleased to feel the obvious satisfaction of the high guests. <br><br>  The delegation walked past the cabinets with the signs "Polygraph", "First Section", "Contact Monitoring Bureau". <br><br>  - What is it?  - they are interested. <br>  - The file is collected: if there is anyone who will meet in the evening, and what will he give to whom, the general answered, entering his office. <br><br>  It immediately became clear that his master was used to keeping everything under control. <br><br>  It looked like a trader from the stock exchange or a flight control center: a huge half-wall monitor showed pictures from all one hundred workers' monitors at once.  Some of them are highlighted in pink - those who slow down the rate of writing code or something else important.  The second huge monitor showed video from surveillance cameras. <br><br>  On the director's neat five-meter table were full trays of papers: ‚Äúdaily reports,‚Äù ‚Äúmemo notes,‚Äù and something else. <br><br>  In the center of the table lay a multi-colored printout of A3 format: ‚ÄúSchedule of layoffs‚Äù. <br>  It is obvious that the owner worked on this document for a long time and thoughtfully. <br><br>  The inspectors were satisfied, they were confused only by one thing: the MVP of a cardinal, innovative, new, systemic solution was not yet obtained .... <br><br>  - ... 60-hour work week, conversations with relatives, improvement of the KPI system ... - Gendir reported on new initiatives. <br><br>  At this time, on the monitor of the video surveillance cameras, it was clear how the guards pulled out a man from the table, dragged him to the entrance door and laid him on the sidewalk, carefully adjusting his tie. <br><br>  - What is it?  The rosy cheeker asked. <br>  - Do not worry!  He signed everything long ago.  And now ... well, maybe the heart ... But we do not need accidents at work? <br><br>  The visit went to a logical conclusion, the general order was approved by the management. <br><br>  That's just with the MVP ...  Well, somehow did not develop ....  Temporarily, probably. <br><br>  <b>Ps.</b>  <b>From the author.</b> <br><br>  Of course, this is a compilation of three companies. <br>  Place of action: Moscow (City, Skolkovo (!)) And Kaluga region. <br>  Action time: summer 2018 - spring 2019. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444350/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444350/</a></p>
