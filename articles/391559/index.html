      Long thought - in which topic to post a message. <br>  "I'm PR"?  Well, actually, not me, and not really PR, and the project is non-commercial.  "Information Security"?  This is also not the case; here it‚Äôs more about anonymity ... In general, some questions.  So I will try briefly and to the point, and you already decide whether the hubs and tags are right or wrong. <br><br>  So, the person addressed me (hereinafter referred to as the Customer) and asked for help.  He had a non-formalized TK, a small amount of money and a desire to make the dream a reality.  I had to act as such an expert in problem solving (as in ‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù), or rather, write a distinct TK, having figured out how many and what buttons should be on which page of the site and what they (buttons) should do.  Well, naturally, the selection of a programmer is also on me (the benefit is registration for ‚ÄúFreelance‚Äù), production control, calculations, catching bugs ... <br><br>  About how it all happened, I will not spread.  It was all: non-optimal TZ, which I reworked four times, disappearing and emerging developers, fun with hosting and a domain name ... And it lasted so long that I had already lost faith in the result.  But in the end, the service earned, I tested it as a parent, and I want to tell you about it. <br><br>  The customer (and me) still do not know what happened in the end.  A forum is not a forum, a blog is not a blog, it does not look like a social network at all ... some kind of hybrid.  In philosophy, this is reminiscent of 4chan, because it allows you to work with the service without any registration.  But at the same time (unlike the anonymous forum) the list of topics is NOT displayed. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screen minimalist start page</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1e/860/a70/a1e860a7074d4ee195c86b478634ced0" alt="image"><br></div></div><br><br>  It works like this.  <b>Any</b> visitor can place text (up to 2000 characters) on the site, get a permanent link to his record.  Link clever, kind of "https: //kak2tak.tk/hjHJ7bj6t79BHJ".  Further on this link, <b>any</b> other person can enter the site and read the record.  And if the author has allowed - then comment.  There are traditional features like ‚ÄúNotify about comments by email‚Äù, but this is optional ... Also, the author gets a password in order to delete comments if necessary or edit his entry.  If no one reads or writes the entry, it will be deleted in a month. <br><br>  The result is such a one-time anonymous blog.  But the main devilish charm is that pages with posts are not indexed by search engines.  And to the heap - the site does not have a list of records and search.  Thus, anonymity and privacy are combined here - the page is publicly accessible, and only favorites who have a link can read it.  Undoubtedly, you can come across the record randomly, but for that, and sly long link ... <br><br>  The customer offered his version of the case when this service can help. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Quote</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚ÄúHow did you go on vacation?‚Äù  How are things anyway? ‚ÄùFriends ask.  "Well, something like that ...", - you answer and start telling.  More precisely, write to Facebook or zhezhechechku.  And then - convulsively close the record, wondering if the mother-in-law had time to read the colorful description of your walk through the hot places of Amsterdam. <br><br>  Finally, the message is hidden and shown only to the most trusted friends, all names are changed.  And here it turns out that Vasya‚Äôs childhood friend, who certainly needs to know all the details of the trip, is not registered with FB.  And Kolya, who is now eager to take part in the discussion of the varieties of "coffee" served in the coffee shops, the employer blocks access to social networks. <br><br>  But you could just post an anonymous trip report on our ‚ÄúSomething like this ...‚Äù service and calmly discuss it with your favorites.  It's simple: go to kak2tak.tk, write a message and send a link to the page to interested persons in any way convenient for you. <br></div></div><br>  Obviously, it is possible to discuss not only trips "to the left", but also some other secret things of different degrees of legality.  However, the Customer assures that the content is monitored by several Autobot (more precisely, autospam filters), as well as two brave, non-working admins.  It is planned to cooperate with Roskomnadzor, removing the "propaganda of everything" on demand. <br><br>  With monetization it will be difficult, but such a task was not originally set.  The trouble is that you cannot start banner networks on the pages of the records - they will immediately begin to climb the text and index it, and this is prohibited by design.  So the project is non-commercial from the word ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù, the benefit is that not so much money is consumed.  But we still hung banners :).  On static pages - Google Ads (there is possible), and on the pages of posts - classic banners in the form of a picture on which you can click. <br><br>  Finally, there are two questions (I will not create a survey, since there may be many options). <br>  What other options for using the service do you see? <br>  What is <a href="http://kak2tak.tk/">Kak2tak.tk</a> : a blog, a forum or an anti-social network? <br><br>  Thanks for attention <br><br>  PS I ask you to understand the lags with understanding.  There was not enough pocket money for expensive foreign hosting.  Yes, and the current hoster very inopportunely started moving the server.  So the server has temporary cloudiness, when it shamelessly slows down, sends a confirming email for half an hour and so on ... But after a minute, everything can fly again.  If you want to report bugs - this can be done not only through the contact form on the site, but also here on GT (me in PM). <br><br>  UPD I do not know if anyone is following this record :), but I inform you that after a couple of breakdowns and transfers from the hoster to the hoster Kak2tak.tk again online.  All posted records, of course, are not lost. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391559/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391559/</a></p>
