  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Prevent cancer: ways to avoid half of the tumors on the example of a single Canadian province</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A study of Canadian scientists in a single province with a population of 3.8 million people showed that about 45% of cancer cases are related to preventable factors.  Smoking, lack of exercise, unhealthy diet, excess weight and alcohol increase the chance of tumors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32d/6ef/bbe/32d6efbbe86be239c71d6b37395ed441.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As part of the study, cases of cancer were studied over several years in the Canadian province of Alberta, with its capital in Edmonton.  According to the results, the specialists made a list of factors that influenced the formation of tumors.  According to researchers, 6,700 cases of cancer per year can be avoided if residents follow a few simple tips. <br><br>  Alberta residents can <a href="http://albertapreventscancer.ca/">see online</a> information about various types of cancer and whether their lifestyle and environment can affect the occurrence of cancer.  In November 2014, researchers received a $ 750,000 grant from the Canadian Public Cancer Research Institute to conduct country-wide research and find a link between cancer and risk factors in each province.

Regular exercise reduces the risk of endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer - which is 1,298 cases per year. <br><br>  Some hormones in the blood help cancer cells grow.  Estrogen affects breast cancer and endometrial cancer.  Insulin causes growth in other parts of the body.  An active lifestyle reduces the level of these hormones.  Exercise helps strengthen the immune system.  Also, physical activity speeds up the process of digestion and protects the colon from excessive amounts of exposure to carcinogens in the stool.  Sport helps control weight - another important factor in preventing cancer. <br><br>  Researchers advise to engage in sports for at least 150 minutes a week, not forgetting exercises to strengthen muscles, bones and joints.  The same advice will help reduce the risk of heart disease, heart attack, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis and depression, as well as improve sleep and mood. <br><br><img src="http://medicena.ru/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1387182062_kino-ussr.ru-sportivnye-plakati9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Watch for food </h4><br>  A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and fiber along with meat without too much processing helps reduce the chance of cancer.  ‚ÄúWe can prevent 810 cases of cancer in Alberta per year - if we help each other eat better,‚Äù they write on the research website. <br><br>  Often cancer is associated with a lack of vegetables and fruits - 2% of cases in the province.  The lack of fiber leads to colorectal cancer - it is 6% of cases.  Too much <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/264816/">red meat</a> and deep processing products also lead to colorectal cancer.  We are talking about pork, beef, ham, bacon, sausage and sausages.  12% of cases are associated with excess salt. <br><br>  A healthy balanced diet should include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, sources of protein - meat or meat substitutes.  Nutrients in fruits and vegetables affect the chemical elements that can damage DNA and help restore it, block the formation of cancer-forming elements, and stimulate the immune system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/288/764/63d/28876463dad560f904e02ef41a541395.jpg" width="350"><br><br><h4>  Watch for weight </h4><br>  If everyone in Alberta were monitoring their weight, then 673 cases of cancer per year could have been avoided.  Overweight is associated with several types of cancer: colorectal and endometrial, breast, kidney, pancreatic, esophageal and gallbladder cancer.  But if pancreatic cancer is associated with overweight or obesity in 7% of cases, then for esophageal cancer this figure was 31%. <br><br>  When a person is overweight, the cells respond more slowly to insulin.  Therefore, the body raises the level of this hormone, which leads to the growth of cancer cells.  The same with estrogen, the level of which also increases with excess weight.  Another factor is inflammatory processes. <br><br>  With excess weight increases the chance to get gastroesophageal reflux - throwing the contents of the stomach into the esophagus.  And this is an increase in the chance of esophageal cancer. <br><br>  Alberta Medical Services recommends that men maintain waist circumference up to 102 cm and women up to 88 cm. The body mass index can be calculated on the calculator at the bottom of <a href="http://albertapreventscancer.ca/reduce-your-risk/maintain-a-healthy-weight/">this page</a> .  The index will not work if you have a large amount of muscle mass - the result will show you "obesity" or "overweight." <br><br><img src="http://medicena.ru/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1387184769_14.jpg" width="350" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Check with the doctors </h4><br>  The detection of tumors in the early stages significantly increases the chance of cure.  Doctors advise to undergo a full examination at least once every three years.  If a person has HPV, then it is better to go to the doctor more often. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c51/f3b/b7b/c51f3bb7b4ebd6e7e9fca30a99be8fcc.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Prevent the risk of infection with HPV - Human Papillomavirus </h4><br>  Human papillomavirus has more than 170 strains in 43 species and 5 genera.  Its carriers are six out of ten people.  This virus causes warts, including genital warts. <br><br>  But the worst thing is that it causes cervical cancer in 100% of cases, anus cancer in 90% of cases, cancer of the penis in 50% of cases, vaginal cancer in 40% of cases and cancer of the oral mucosa in 35%. <br><br>  Of a hundred people with HPV, seventy are sexually active.  Most people do not even suspect that they have HPV, and many have not heard of this virus.  But often people with HPV defeat it with their own immune system without harm to health. <br><br>  HPV infection is easy - it spreads from skin contact in the genital area.  No need for penetration, enough oral sex and touch.  In any case, condoms will not save.  Vaccine and smoking cessation will help. <br><br><h4>  Stop smoking </h4><br>  According to researchers, smoking is associated with thirteen types of cancer.  One of seven cases of cancer is associated with tobacco.  Of the seven thousand chemicals in a cigarette, at least 172 are toxic, and 69 are exactly the cause of cancer.  Passive smoking and chewing tobacco can also cause tumors. <br><br>  One day after quitting smoking, the chance of a heart attack is reduced, after nine months it becomes easier to breathe, and after ten years the risk of lung cancer is reduced by 50%. <br><br><h4>  Sunbathe less </h4><br>  Ultraviolet radiation in Alberta causes 82% of cases of melanoma - skin cancer.  Excessive amounts of ultraviolet radiation from the sun or in tanning beds are associated with the formation of skin cancer and weakening of the immune system.  Trips to a solarium at the age of up to thirty-five years increase the chance of getting melanoma by 59%. <br><br><h4>  Drink less alcohol </h4><br>  Researchers write that reducing alcohol consumption will help avoid injury, cruelty, and poisoning.  And what about cancer ‚Äî alcohol causes 617 cases of cancer a year in Alberta. <br><br>  We are talking about colorectal cancer and breast cancer, laryngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, laryngeal cancer.  Chances of getting one of these diseases increase if alcohol goes hand in hand with smoking. <br><br>  Alcohol consumption increases the number of free radicals that can damage cells and cause cancer.  Alcohol absorbs vitamin B6, which increases the risk of developing breast and colorectal cancer.  Elevated estrogen levels also increase the risk of breast cancer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/110/84c/da5/11084cda51db72cddb3e04a951ec3d08.png" width="350" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Other risks </h4><br>  Researchers identified several factors: <br><ul><li>  hepatitis B and C, </li><li>  oral contraceptives, </li><li>  hormone replacement therapy, </li><li>  radon (you can check the level of this gas in the apartment by calling specialists), </li><li>  air pollution. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390067/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390067/</a></p>
