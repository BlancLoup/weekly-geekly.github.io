This list looks very believable.  And I made (and still make) at least 4 of these 5 mistakes. <br><br>  The main idea - do not be a cog in the system.  The image of a post-industrial person consists of these five regrets, who drives himself into the framework of his realities and dutifully turns in them until he stops.

      It is alarming that all these errors, which lead to unfortunately, are ‚Äúomission errors‚Äù.  You score on your dreams, ignore your family, repress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be happy.  Omission Mistakes = The most dangerous type of error, because you commit them by default. <br><br>  I would like to avoid such mistakes.  But how?  Ideally, you should change your life so that it has other ‚Äúdefault settings‚Äù.  But it may not be possible to do this completely.  While you are making these mistakes, you should probably remind yourself that they should not be made.  I decided to invert this list of regrets into a list of five commands: <br><br><ul><li>  do not hammer on your dreams; </li><li>  do not work too much; </li><li>  always say what you think; </li><li>  encourage friendship; </li><li>  be happy. </li></ul><br>  And then put them at the top of their list of affairs. <br><br>  Paul Graham, April 2012 <br>  <i>Translation: Alena Karnaukhova</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Text that made Paul Graham think</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚ÄúI have always been interested in the wisdom of our older generation and often do exercises with students and clients when, it seems to me, they have deviated from the path that really matters in their lives.  I ask them to present themselves after many years, looking back at this very moment right now and ask themselves what they would like to do differently. ‚Äù  Bronnie Ware is an Australian nurse, she worked in hospice for many years and took care of the dying.  She later published a book titled ‚ÄúTop Five Regrets for Death‚Äù.  Regret, says Bronnie, is not always a waste of time.  You can consider them as something useful if today they give us the opportunity for change for the better. <br><br>  Here you have the Top 5 from Bronnie Ware.  Use them as a guiding star to help yourself remember what you really want from life.  We can turn out of the way, but when we have a guiding star, it helps to return to that path. <br><br><h2>  1. I would like to have the courage to live my own life, and not the life that others expect from me </h2><br>  From the moment of birth, we look at our parents, who teach us the rules of life in this world and expect from us certain behavior that seems right to them.  Culture and other people tell us how we should dress, what to say and feel, how to behave, and even whom to work.  What would it look like if you touched in soul with what seems right for you and live a genuine life? <br><br><h2>  2. I would like to work less </h2><br>  No one ever reprimanded himself on his deathbed for the missed work day.  Sometimes we work too much because the routine is sucked in, in another case - to meet other people's expectations, and sometimes work is only dependent behavior, self-deception, which allows us to temporarily avoid mental discomfort.  Are there more important things in life that are worth paying attention to?  Can we work a little less and turn our attention to those things that enrich us more? <br><br><h2>  3. I would like to have the courage to express my feelings. </h2><br>  At work, in friendly and love relationships, we are more often ready to draw hasty conclusions and bite our tongue than to be genuine and talk about our feelings.  We often miss the opportunity to tell others that we love them, and thereby create a deeper relationship.  Maybe someone hurts us, but we are silent for fear?  Learning how to better understand our feelings and express them in acceptable ways can help us feel more intimate with others, confident and happy. <br><br><h2>  4. I am sorry that I did not keep in touch with my friends </h2><br>  Often friendships are lost due to the fact that we did not put enough effort to maintain them.  Now there are so many ways to maintain relationships - this is sms, phone, e-mail, Skype, e-mail.  Take time to maintain relationships with your friends while it is, and you can have them. <br><br><h2>  5. I am sorry that I did not allow myself to be happier. </h2><br>  Bony says many people did not notice until the end of life that happiness is a choice.  We can make a conscious choice between what develops us and what destroys us.  So, in what we are ready to invest, and in what - no.  We can experience stress, anxiety, be depressed and even be traumatized.  However, we can choose how to relate to all this and what to do about it.  Awareness of this helps us deal with adversity easier.  Maybe it's time to start making those choices that will make you happier? <br><br>  Take a moment to look back and look at the top five regrets of dying people.  Think about how you can use these tips in your life, starting today. <br><br>  Elisha Goldstein, Ph.D // Translated by Nina Volontey <br>  [ <a href="http://personagrata-studio.ru/articles/topovaya-pyaterka-sozhaleniy-pered-smertyu/">source</a> ] <br></div></div><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YHiDdB6ej7Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314096/</a></p>
