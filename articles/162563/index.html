Of course, there is some truth in them - no one has canceled the professional deformation, but most of it is still a figment, over which the developer himself sometimes wishes to laugh. <br><br>  In my opinion, the concept of introversion is also sometimes interpreted incorrectly.  And in a bunch of programmer-introvert born very crazy ideas. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Some theory </h4><br>  To begin with an understanding of the nature of the introvert.  According to Carl Jung's theory, the type of temperament is inherent in man from birth and depends on his physiological structure.  So the cerebral blood flow in the inner is more complex and long.  What is the reason for this, and the more it is good or bad, we will not consider it.  It will be more interesting for us to make out the differences between introverts and extroverts.

      First of all introverts are distinguished by the fact that they replenish their reserves of vital energy on their own.  For this they have enough of their internal ideas, emotions, experiences.  They are more sluggish and less social as they preserve their strength.  They can easily be transported by what is happening around, even if it is something joyful.  They are accustomed to more aware of their own than to take from the outside.  Inner characterized by a predominance of depth over the breadth of thinking.  At the same time, introverts, in comparison with extroverts, are able to feel the task better, focus more deeply.  Positive sides are also perseverance, perseverance, endurance. <br><br><h4>  Discussing </h4><br>  Why did I start to develop this topic?  The fact is that we live in the world of extroverts and without an understanding of their essence, the introvert will experience certain problems, and after this the people around him will feel the difficulties. <br><br><h5>  So what is worth paying attention to? </h5><br><ol><li>  The most important task is to realize the type of your temperament, and if you are an introvert, then get ready to take care of yourself and love yourself.  It turns out that internalists possess unique qualities that enable them to solve a number of specific tasks better than extroverts and experience pleasure from it.  We are talking about long-term projects in which they are ready to dive completely. </li><li>  Introverts need to carefully prepare their workplace.  It is desirable to have the opportunity at some point to plunge headlong into the work and thereby close off from the outside world, replenishing their energy reserves.  Partitions, hedges or deaf earphones are perfect for this. </li><li>  Introverts are advised to plan their work day in advance.  So, the insider needs to know today the topic of tomorrow‚Äôs meeting or brainstorming.  Then the environment for him will be more comfortable and natural inhibition will be replaced by the ability to consider the problem from all sides. </li><li>  Introvert desirable to choose a convenient communication system for him.  Face-to-face meetings and big companies are able to drain it.  So, if possible, use other methods of interaction, such as Skype, mail or little notes on the walls. </li><li>  Introvert, like no one else, is recommended to divide their tasks into smaller ones.  A clear work schedule helps them calculate their energy reserves and keep their work progress under control.  This is very essential for the inner peace. </li><li>  Introverts need to provide in advance a margin of time when planning the timing of the task.  It is extremely important for the insider to know that there is some kind of insurance.  As a rule, it helps to finish the work even earlier. </li><li>  Introvert important to learn to relax.  Most often, he does not understand what an incomprehensible contribution he makes to the solution of the problem and neglects rest, refusing to leave as well.  This is fundamentally wrong and can lead to overvoltage. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Finally </h5><br>  Introverts are unique people who can solve a problem like no other.  Their unique character is a very important link in the system, without which humanity could not achieve many results.  It is important to understand this and to live in harmony with oneself and with others. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162563/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162563/</a></p>
