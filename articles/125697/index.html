      I am not at all interested in how to take this, however, I want to show you some interesting examples. <br><br>  Let's start with Apple. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  "The transition between input modes."  In accordance with the position in space, a computer using, for example, accelerometers and position sensors, can change the ‚Äúinput modes and the corresponding user interfaces‚Äù.  The patent was filed on July 9, 2009.  Paul Costa is listed as an inventor.  Currently, Paul is Apple's Hardware Engineering Manager. <br>  Even IBM's tablet laptop with Windows 2.0, 5 centimeters thick, falls under this patent. <br><br>  "Web Browser Audio Controls" offers to selectively block the audio stream from websites, allowing you to listen to any other audio sources. <br>  The idea is simple to obscene: the browser is supplied with its own volume control and the "Mute" button. <br>  The document can be seen, for example, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/14570252/Apple-Patent-Web-Browser-Audio-Controls">here</a> . <br><br>  The company documented the appearance of the iPhone without the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button, because the patent in the USA even extends to devices that ‚Äúlook like‚Äù the sample presented in the documents. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32a/f32/212/32af3221294bcd9f13d287fb6e56b862.jpg"><br><br>  An animated user interface, represented by a sequence of transitional states of moving images.  As an example, an illustration of the display of the iPhone was shown, showing the well-known ‚ÄúCover Flow‚Äù mode. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cfa/152/c5a/cfa152c5a913db87650af79555bbf4ea.jpg"><br><br>  Virtual on-screen keyboard for media devices. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d5/f5b/e06/2d5f5be06d762bc125fab85d56fc8c26.jpg"><br><br>  Video conference mode.  The system architecture consists of a central distribution component that receives video from two or more participants in a conversation.  From the obtained data, the central site ‚Äúcollects‚Äù a common image, which consists of pictures of each participant.  And they, in turn, are sent the final result with the exception of their own image - this helps reduce the network load.  In addition, the images are arranged in such a way that the participants in the conversation are simultaneously located on the screen and do not overlap each other. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/005/42e/859/00542e859bafe71bb4cb3f5106a92880.jpg"><br><br>  Apple describes the social iGroups application, which, using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology, transfers data between devices in close proximity. <br>  Owners of mobile devices can share promotional materials, e-business cards, contacts and other similar information at a single party or business meeting. <br><br>  According to the document, Apple, on the basis of information from sensors, is going to determine the heartbeat parameters of a person who is holding a gadget with sensors installed in the case. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/398/2f2/48a/3982f248ad62927895245b1a12825707.jpg"><br><br>  For example, in the patent for the POP application (in Russian, the cash register) it is said about the possibility of making purchases using a smartphone.  To identify the owner, it is proposed to use a fingerprint scanner, and with the help of the front camera you can scan bar and QR codes for self-payment for the goods. <br>  The patent description also refers to the use of a camera for photographing and recognizing necessary documents. <br><br>  Another similar patent was the ConcertTicket + application, which allows users to quickly purchase tickets to concerts and various events. <br><br>  The essence of the patent, called "External Light Illumination of Display Screens", is to install two interchangeable accessories behind the laptop: <br>  - The first of them could accumulate solar energy and light from other sources, while performing an ordinary powerful solar battery that can save the main battery of a computer. <br>  - And the second one could be used to reflect direct sunlight on the back wall of the screen and not to light it at all with the help of the internal capabilities of the computer. <br><br>  Apple received a patent for an iPad with two dock connectors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6d2/f58/5c4/6d2f585c46caa0df5ea49535fc49e20f.jpg"><br><br>  Another patent is dedicated to the universal MagSafe connector for iDevices, with which the user can charge both a laptop and an Apple mobile gadget, while reducing the number of busy ports in a computer.  But after all, an ordinary USB cable allows you to synchronize an iOS device, how to be in this case?  For these purposes, the patent describes the possibility of using optical fiber. <br><br>  Portable electronic devices with multi-touch input and in great detail describes all the gestures currently available for controlling iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and apple trackpads. <br><br>  A patent with the name ‚ÄúEllipse Fitting for Multitouch Surfaces‚Äù describes some methods for entering information that are familiar to all owners of the devices listed above: typing and text recognition, pointing to objects, manipulating them, scrolling, and so on. <br><br>  In the patent "Simultaneous Sensing Arrangement" refers to the hardware sensors and the processing of information received from them.  A little later, in early December 2010, the company received another 16 patents.  Among them was a document describing a special configuration for multi-touch devices, allowing the company to license it to third parties who could use multi-touch for ATMs, electronic terminals, and so on. <br><br>  Apple received a patent accessory with a pen-shaped capacitive tip that allows it to be used with iDevices. <br>  Styles from other manufacturers do not allow to determine how much the user has pressed the screen of the mobile gadget.  Therefore, Apple solves this problem with a special sensor built into its stylus and a Wi-Fi / Bluetooth transmitter.  Also, the accelerometer and special buttons for adjusting the color, such as a brush (or what the user will set in the settings) are provided in the accessory. <br><br>  And another interesting document relates to solar energy.  However, in contrast to the usual use of such batteries, the system initially tries to use solar energy and only when it is absent it goes to the "emptying" of batteries or powered from the outlet. <br><br>  Everybody knows the ‚ÄúSlide to unlock‚Äù interface element on the lock screen, allowing the user into the magical world of the apple device, and equally popular pop-up letters that appear when you press the virtual keyboard key of the mobile operating system. <br><br>  Two patents "Animated graphical user interface for the screen or part thereof", which endow with the magic spell "Patent protection" to animate the lock screen and keyboard. <br><br>  A kind of software shell that will block for a certain time a few basic functions in the system until the user has completely viewed the block of announcements.  Advertising, according to the text of the patent, can be visual or acoustic and offer the user some interesting services - free or at a significant discount. <br>  However, not everything is so bad: according to the authors of the patent, this modification of Mac OS X is designed for computers installed in public places and providing free access to the Internet.  Advertising is broadcast at regular intervals using an internal timer, however, if desired, the user can ‚Äúpretend‚Äù in advance ‚Äúfor his hard-earned money‚Äù and work productively or turn off the display of ads for the duration of the session. <br><br>  Patented intellectual system for a two-wheeled friend, in all likelihood, similar to the sports system Nike +, available to owners of iPod touch and iPhone 4. <br>  In addition to all of the above, the patent states that this system may be applicable to other vehicles. <br><br>  Patent of wireless charging for gadgets and computer peripherals.  The patent application describes the concept of charging various devices ‚Äúby air‚Äù.  And it can be not only gadgets, such as iPhone, iPod, iPad, but also peripherals - a wireless mouse, keyboard, touchpad. <br>  No special covers and floor mats are required - a computer will act as an energy transmitter.  Thus, the mouse and keyboard will always be charged, and devices can be recharged just by putting it on the table.  Tesla did not have time. <br><br>  The patent describes the increase in density in a cell of a lithium battery and the charging of a battery with the help of a certain multistage direct current and constant voltage (CC-CV).  It‚Äôs quite difficult to understand a patent, unless professionals understand it, but the whole point is that the battery will keep charging more! <br><br>  ‚ÄúSmart Frame‚Äù, this new patent will allow users to control applications, the volume of the sound and the brightness of the screen when you drag your finger on the frame or some other manipulations with it. <br>  Those.  sensory add.  Buttons, for example, for volume, on laptops are outlawed. <br><br>  "The method of providing automatic and dynamic translation of messages in an object-oriented programming language into the messages of the operating system through the use of intermediate objects" <br><br>  And it is just something from the category of "obvious - incredible" looks almost a detective story with a patent application, which is currently sold in the App Store. <br>  The developers of the rather popular ‚ÄúWhere To?‚Äù Program, which, based on GPS data, allows you to find nearby useful establishments, shops, cultural objects, etc., were extremely surprised and shocked when they saw among the screenshots of another patented application while reading the morning RSS feed iTravel for travel is an exact copy of the main window of its program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec7/09f/b5f/ec709fb5fc17c26fa4b0ddc3912a2cdf.png"><br><br>  Competent people in this matter explained that this illustration does not mean theft at all.  Most likely, the patent attorney responsible for filing the application did not find anything more appropriate to illustrate similar functionality and simply used the thumbnail of the window ‚ÄúWhere To?‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125697/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125697/</a></p>
