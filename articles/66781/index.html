  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Selection of work in RuNet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of last year, like many, I was left without work, but with an impressive loan, this prompted me to take active steps to find work.  On one of the most beautiful days, I came to the personnel officer of one company, on the basis of which several internet projects were launched and promoted, including a recruitment project.  For an interview for a vacancy in this project, I came. <br><br>  After the interview, I was asked to prepare a development strategy for the service and ways to monetize it.  Shortly before that, I worked in a fund investing in Internet start-ups, so I had a good idea how to cope with the task.  But!  It turned out not so simple. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, there is a site with a certain number of registered users (according to my estimates, about 100,000).  The users are mostly inactive. <br><br>  What is needed?  Monetize service. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      What is the problem?  The service is non-unique, not much better than the ones available on the market.  And that means you need to come up with some features that will be so valuable to the user that they will force him to at least register another account besides the one on hh.ru, and maybe even pay some money for additional services. <br><br>  The first thing I decided to do is to study the market, - both ours and foreign. <br><br>  <strong>Recruitment market.</strong> <br><br>  The sites of the Runet in the field of recruiting services can be divided into several groups: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Free job search sites (job.ru, rabota.ru) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Sites with a business model based on the provision of paid services to employers (HeadHunter and others), <br>  ‚Ä¢ Sites with a business model based on the provision of paid services to applicants (cvonline.ru and others), relevant, by the way, in the period of unemployment, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Communities in business and job search (MoiKrug, Executive). <br><br>  In the West, there is one service that occupies the lion‚Äôs share of the job search market - Monster.com (which, by the way, planned to enter the Russian market 2 years ago).  And of course many different competitors and competitors. <br><br>  <strong>Development strategy.</strong> <br><br>  1. Adding psychological testing (like tests that are offered during an interview).  This will allow employers to make selection of specialists by employers not only by knowledge and experience (as implemented on all sites of the Runet in this niche), but also by personal qualities.  Such a mechanism can be implemented by allowing users to fill in their profile on their own, or using psychological tests to determine certain qualities of a person.  By itself, work experience does not indicate the potential of a person, but the presence of certain personal qualities will make it possible to select the most accurate candidate for the desired vacancy. <br><br>  2. Slightly shift the filling of the user profile towards the full profile profile.  The main task is to attract users who are not in the process of finding a job at the moment (for example, high-level specialists rarely look for work - they are usually headquartered by competing companies, or the job is searched for by acquaintances and is found very quickly).  At the same time, an employer interested in a particular person can make an offer.  This will allow the resource to move away from positioning the service as a database with ‚Äúaverage specialists‚Äù and ‚Äúunqualified specialists‚Äù (the absolute majority of Runet's resources) and shift it towards the database of highly qualified specialists and their business connections.  None of the Runet services has fallen into this niche, as indirectly indicated by LinkedIn‚Äôs popularity among Russian users.  Thus, it will be possible to assemble a database of not only active resumes, but also passive ones, and for the employer this will be a good way to select all targeted candidates. <br>  There are also possible additional services that can be implemented in the framework of the project in the future (statistics on areas that are interesting to applicants, the definition of the "cost" of a specialist, etc.). <br><br>  <strong>Business model.</strong> <br>  At that time, it made sense to focus on earning income from businesses - employers who can offer various additional services for recruitment (the situation has now changed a bit): <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Advanced selection of people by parameters <br>  ‚Ä¢ Search by passive resume, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Paid priority in the base of vacancies, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Paid places in the weekly mailing list (which applicants subscribe to), etc. <br><br>  In case of successful repositioning to the ‚Äúservice of highly qualified specialists‚Äù, it will be possible to provide additional paid services to end users, including, for example: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Advanced user profile with additional features <br>  ‚Ä¢ Request friendship directly, and not through friends, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Paid priority in the resume database, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to contact a person for a fee, etc. <br><br>  All these proposals are not particularly original and I did not manage to come up with any killer chip, nevertheless the work was completed, sent and left unanswered.  I was not given access to the data, so feel free to post a part of the analysis here. <br><br>  Probably the link, I still will not lay out.  But I don‚Äôt want to advertise to people whose HR doesn‚Äôt even consider answering a letter after the work is done :) <br><br>  <strong>Questions</strong> <br>  I propose to think about this: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ How much does the effort to promote a project that is of no interest to users and which traffic is just catching up pays off?  Recall also the project vspomni.ru. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ What features I missed, and what could be thought of as a revolutionary on the Internet recruitment market, because it is obvious that this market is interesting. <br><br>  PS Judging by alexa.com site traffic has not increased, there were short-term ups, at the moment the service attendance is equal to the one a year ago. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66781/</a></p>
