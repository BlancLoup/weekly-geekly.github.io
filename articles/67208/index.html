  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hamsters are dying out</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, participating in the discussion of one habratopik, I realized that I, in general, did not need personal hosting.  I simply don‚Äôt use it, for which year I‚Äôve got a stub there with links to the internet services I use and my contact information, which changes its graphical representation a maximum of once a year / two.  I am sure that the majority of hosting owners "under the hamsters" the same situation.  But the reason is not laziness, which prevents you from creating a full-fledged homepage or portfolio or installing a blog engine, etc.  The reason is that there is no need for this, since there are proven and, in most cases, much more convenient social services for all of this! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <strong>What does hosting give me?</strong>  - Disk space, mail, some pribludy in cpanel (which you can‚Äôt see without tears), php, mysql, some people have already started to introduce jabber.  Many people pre-install Wordpress, forums, chats, and anything else that, in general, the experienced user and developer haven‚Äôt rested, as he will do all this better himself, and most beginners just won‚Äôt figure it out.  <strong>So I almost never use it all</strong> .  I‚Äôm sending mail to Gmail, and after a while, I‚Äôll register a domain for myself (it‚Äôs a gift, it just so happens that I don‚Äôt manage it), and I‚Äôll do it with Google Apps, I don‚Äôt have the file server after the Dropbox. I need a blog in my LiveJournal, microblogging on Twitter, storing photos and organizing photo albums - Yandex.photo and so on.  As a freelancer, I was trying to make a portfolio site, but now I don‚Äôt have to do it myself, since now there is a terrific <a title="CargoCollective" href="http://cargocollective.com/">Cargo</a> to which you can tie a domain.  This I listed only what I like, and after all there are more than enough analogs. <br><br>  But how then to be with individuality and, not least, centralization?  By individuality, I mean a personal domain, and by centralization, the management of all this bravado of favorite services from one place.  Suppose the first problem for someone is not a problem at all, many services allow you to screw a domain, but not everyone satisfies all needs and in most cases the opportunity to hang something else on the same domain disappears.  The second point is also solved, for example, almost everything that is needed, let's say, the average novice hamster has a <a title="mylivepage" href="http://mylivepage.ru/">http://mylivepage.ru/</a> , and if not, a stub with a link to all social services and networks and a common message feed can serve as <a title="bestpersons" href="http://www.bestpersons.ru/">http://www.bestpersons.ru/</a> .  But there is also <strong>Opera Unite</strong> !  True, I don‚Äôt know how popular this ‚Äúrevolutionary technology‚Äù has become, how flexible it is, and whether there is an opportunity to screw a domain and be generally <em>self-hosting</em> , I don‚Äôt use it, just like the browser itself, but as an excuse for someone to refuse hosting is considered.

      Of course, there are a huge number of shortcomings in solving the two problems described above, and you should not forget about paranoia (quite, by the way, reasonable in some cases), in almost all cases good old ftp disappears (and sometimes it is just necessary), as well as the possibility of expansion and posting the same static html pages.  But progress does not stand still and all these inconveniences and shortcomings have another weighty counterargument.  <strong>In the era of web2.0 and social networks, personal hosting in the form that is widespread now completely cuts off that sociality.</strong> <br><br>  As a result, I can say with confidence that ‚Äúhosting for a hamster‚Äù is already a relic of the past and it will be in less and less demand.  Internet users can agree with me or not, debate on this topic in the comments or just silently express their opinions with the help of a vote, but this is not the case, for them everything that will happen in the future is all for the better, progress is :) But the <strong>owners of hosting companies are losing customers</strong> .  I would even say a whole segment.  It is clear that the main profits are made by corporate clients, but the money is not superfluous and there is a chance to return the category of clients who buy hosting for the ‚Äúhamster‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>How?</strong>  - Revise the concept of hosting, make it more user-friendly and confidently move towards sociality, actively use the API of existing services or develop your own.  I will not actively use Opera Unite because it is deployed on the client side, that is, on my personal computer, and still browser-dependent (well, I don‚Äôt like Opera and that's it), but if all these charms, yes on the server side ... <br><br>  Or, on the contrary, to start fussing about existing social networks, in particular blog services, to provide standard hosting services for ordinary hamsters at the same rates, well, or at higher prices, the possibilities are much greater.  Very good help for monetization, is not it? <br><br>  <b>I will add some comments here:</b> <br><br>  ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/67208/">#</a> ) - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/marazm/" class="user_link">marazm</a> : <br><blockquote>  Really, what a hamster needs is an application capable of drawing a blog, twitter, etc.  from services to your own design.  Well, if possible, if necessary, add a new functionality (it's hard to think of a new one, really) </blockquote><br>  ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/67208/">#</a> ) - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/havoc_theory/" class="user_link">havoc_theory</a> : <br><blockquote>  In my opinion, public customizable start pages like netvibes.com are very similar to a step in that direction.  On one page, you can integrate a YouTube account, Del.icio.us bookmarks, posts from Twitter, photos from several hosting sites and so on. </blockquote><br>  And yes, the test site ‚â† hamster </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67208/</a></p>
