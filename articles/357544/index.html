determination. <br><br>  The judge of the Moscow City Court <b>Basyrov AND.AND.</b> </div></div><br>  The decision of the Moscow City Court immediately caused bewilderment in the Linux community.  The site Opennet.ru <a href="http://www.opennet.ru/opennews/art.shtml%3Fnum%3D44382">note</a> that the Astra Linux Special Edition distribution is distributed under a fairly controversial <a href="http://www.astralinux.com/license-se.html">licensing agreement</a> prohibiting: <br><br><ul><li>  6.1.1.  Copying and replication of the software product or any of its component parts in order to transfer the rights received under this agreement to third parties. </li><li>  6.1.2.  Decompiling and reassembling, unprotecting a software product from copying and replicating any components of a software product. </li><li>  6.1.4.  Distribution of a software product, any changes to it, or translation of its text into another language. </li><li>  6.1.5.  Installing a software product on more than one computer without entering into a License Agreement in accordance with clause 2.1 of this agreement. </li></ul><br>  They <a href="http://www.opennet.ru/openforum/vsluhforumID3/107822.html">joked</a> at the forum that for violating the RusBITECh license agreement we should expect the blocking of the Debian site and so on. <br><br>  If in fact, <a href="http://www.opennet.ru/openforum/vsluhforumID3/107822.html">there are several modules</a> in the Astra Linux distribution that are objects of exclusive rights - these are kernel modules and corresponding user-space bindings to ensure compliance with the requirements for access control to information of the level of secrecy, several utilities for administering the system are still minor . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad4/a5b/668/ad4a5b668b754ec48c519d8949f7b16d.png"><br><br>  However, it is truly an object of copyright. <br><br>  The authors are listed in the court decision: <br>  Lyapin V.R., Sosnin Yu.V., Kovin A.E., Oruzheynikov A.L., Kulikov G.V., Kosykh P.A., Smirnov A.Yu., Mironov A.V., Nepomnyaschikh A .V., Kalichev S.A., Shumilin A.V., Podobaev V.N., Mayorova A.V., Zatolokina V.V., Podyapolsky V.V., Makhalkin A.V. <br><br>  Vladimir Rubanov, Managing Director of Rosplatforma, former president and chief designer of ROSA (Russian Linux distribution), <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2016-05-10_razrabotchiki_rossijskogo_linux_potrebovali_ubrat">agrees with the court‚Äôs decision</a> : ‚ÄúAstra Linux, as an integral product, contains both open and closed components, therefore the developers demand to remove it from torrent distributions in part of the closed components looks logical. " <br><br>  Alexey Smirnov, CEO of Alt Linux, also protects his colleagues: ‚ÄúFor me personally, such prosecution is unpleasant, but from the point of view of the law, they have the right to do so.  It seems to me that in the field of open-source software it is worthwhile to behave more delicately, especially since such a distribution on the torrent does not threaten.  What is the point of downloading a certified distribution kit - without a form, without a license, you don‚Äôt use it for data protection. ‚Äù <br><br>  At the same time, Sarkis Darbinyan, a lawyer of the Roskomsvoboda project, points out that the license and actions of the RusBITech Scientific and Production Association clearly violate the initial terms of the GNU GPL license: ‚ÄúThis license was not created for the organization to manufacture software for the FSB and the Defense Ministry on based on Linux, used the ‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù law to prohibit users from distributing software and changing code, ‚ÄùDarbinyan says.  ‚ÄúI think the Free Software Foundation, as a third party, has every reason to contact the Moscow City Court to reject the said application.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357544/</a></p>
