  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why buy monsters? - The practice of domestic import substitution software</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the last year, one of the most discussed issues at many IT events, including InfoSecurity Russia 2014, RIF + CIB 2015 and Sviaz-Expocomm-2015, was the <a href="http://minsvyaz.ru/ru/documents/4548/">law</a> on software import substitution, designed to limit the share of imported software by 2025 to no more than 50% .  Not only the producers of domestic software, but also other market participants: consumers, industry experts and the state are keenly interested in the law. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1db/188/05e/1db18805e6be492daf26ea2a09525bd0.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The need for import substitution in Russia, according to the legislators, is to ensure security in an unstable political situation (the threat of espionage, the blocking of controlling computer systems) and economic benefits.  Users want to get high-quality and secure software for little money.  Vendors are interested in reducing competition from foreign companies, which, unlike domestic ones, can afford high-budget advertising on a global scale.  That is, in one way or another, but import substitution is useful to all of us. <br><br>  However, each initiative has its negative consequences and problems in implementation.  According to the results, due to the absence of third-party expert assessment of Russian and imported software, or rather the interest of all parties, <a href="http://www.crn.ru/news/detail.php%3Fid%3D93523">national IT solutions will</a> most likely <a href="http://www.crn.ru/news/detail.php%3Fid%3D93523">be lobbied in competitions regardless of quality</a> , and although domestic programmers have always been famous for their high quality code, will not the privilege factor be a demotivator? .  The problems in implementation are clear: the success of the law depends on what the government takes in order to give our IT companies the opportunity to compete with those who are ready to work on the Russian market for zero years, as well as on <a href="http://ibusiness.ru/blog/lyudi_i_tyekhnologii/33909">legal realities</a> .

      Adding optimism is that in some segments of IT products we have solutions that are already ready for competition.  Until July 1, when the law enters into force, it remains not for long.  Let's look at what arguments about the expediency of replacing foreign software with domestic companies such as ALT Linux, Smart-Software and TrueConf, which have long been popularizing the principle of alternatives to Western monster corporations, approach this date. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0c5aa5">Was life on Mars?</font>  <font color="#0c5aa5">Import substitution before the adoption of the state program</font> </h2><br>  The qualitative use of legislative initiatives by the government can be clearly seen in the example of <a href="http://www.altlinux.ru/">ALT Linux</a> . <br><br>  Due to the stringent requirements of the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.zakonrf.info/zakon-o-personalnyh-dannyh/">Law on Personal Data</a> ‚Äù, subsequent acts and changed conditions of tender purchases in 2012-2013, the company delivered its software products to 45,000 jobs. <br><br>  Now "ALT Linux" participates in consortia in three areas of the law on import substitution: mobile and desktop OS, server OS and DBMS.  And he tries to rely both on his developments and <a href="http://www.linux.org.ru/forum/general/11585904">integrate into the process small development companies and universities</a> . <br><br>  The main advantages of state support that the company sees are obtaining financing for the development of specific technologies.  The accumulated experience of struggling in regional tenders for software deliveries and an excellent knowledge of the nuances of software certification and certification in the realities of domestic legislation will give ALT Linux a good handicap in import substitution projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48a/adf/ab2/48aadfab2839417c9b6ba111d0c29957.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0c5aa5">Domestic companies against Western monsters development</font> </h2><br>  A long-term analysis of the use of "heavy" universal import solutions by customers allows <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/">Smart-Soft</a> to say quite confidently: " <i>Half of the capacity is not used in principle, and the finances for licensing these capacities are wasted</i> ."  Western software is often functionally redundant and more expensive, apart from other risks. <br><br>  For example, convincing potential customers to switch to our Traffic Inspector product, which is in no way inferior to Western counterparts, we use the following arguments: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Price.</b>  TI is more profitable both in terms of the purchase price and the cost of renewal.  For example, compare with Kerio, from which quite often, including due to more complete reports, <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/buy/migration/">go to the ‚ÄúTraffic Inspector‚Äù</a> .  Kerio for 5 users costs 282 euros (more than 16,000 rubles at the current rate), and Traffic Inspector costs 4900 rubles.  Renewal of licenses costs about 5170 p.  Kerio (about 1/3 of the original cost of the product) against 1470 p.  at TI, and further payment of licenses is not tied to the exchange rate, which is extremely beneficial and understandable to the corporate and government customers. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Security.</b>  Closing foreign software for use in Russia (refusal to renew, prohibit to sell, etc.) is a completely objective threat to the operation of any enterprise.  Plus, there is absolutely non-zero probability of having program bookmarks, which is fraught with leakage of critical information. </li></ol><br>  A separate argument is the quality of technical support and speed of response to user problems.  If earlier our developers had nothing to respond to the client's argument: ‚Äú <i>We will take equipment and software from a well-known global brand, they will provide world-</i> class <i>technical support</i> ,‚Äù but now times have changed.  It was the lack of high-quality and timely support from CISCO in solving problems that was one of the main arguments for the transition of the entire video surveillance system of Moscow to the domestic software.  This is not counting the direct failure of the sale of equipment.  And the budget for the development of IT infrastructure in Moscow is 5-7 billion rubles annually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41e/83b/ca4/41e83bca496c45c58975acaca4778e45.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0c5aa5">How to make money on the domestic software.</font>  <font color="#0c5aa5">TrueConf Position</font> </h2><br>  Working on the introduction of Russian software in the video conferencing market, <a href="http://trueconf.ru/">TrueConf</a> shows not only the good dynamics of implemented projects (over 25 thousand workplaces and meeting rooms), but also a well-thought-out development strategy: <br><br><ol><li>  The company considers the presence of foreign competitors as an incentive for development. </li><li>  The basis of the company is a strong school of domestic programmers. </li><li>  The main strategic goal is access to world markets. </li></ol><br>  Taking into account the fact that every seventh terminal in Russia works on software from TrueConf (including employees of the Chamber of Commerce of Russia), and the company also includes American customers, the developer does not deviate from the intended strategy. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0c5aa5">Common features and differences in the approaches of companies</font> </h2><br>  Of course, everyone wants to share the cake of state support in their own way.  But there is a common feature in all serious practitioners of import substitution: they are ready to share with all active participants in the process.  If the programmers of free software prefer to see the education system and universities, the commercial developers give the palm to partners and implementers in the field. <br><br>  At the same time, all the companies described allocate special tariffs for state structures and educational centers.  Social responsibility is not an empty sound, but a business practice. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0c5aa5">Positive experience of import substitution and prospects</font> </h2><br>  Today, in Russia, virtually any Western software can be replaced by Russian well-known or little-known developments.  Of course, the implementation of a legislative program for import substitution, to say the least, is unlikely in such a time frame, taking into account at least the lack of a Russian OS that can replace Windows and Russian generally applicable development tools, hardware, not to mention financing.  However, this situation gives certain incentives for the development of local producers. <br><br>  So, many government agencies and large corporations are trying to lean toward purchasing domestic competitive software.  For example, the transition has long been outlined in federal and regional bodies (the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Justice, the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, the Moscow City Hall, etc.), banks (VTB 24, Moscow Industrial Bank, Sberbank, Commercial Bank Petrocommerce and others), industry (FSUE Center for the Operation of Ground-Based Space Infrastructure Facilities, ATLANT), fuel and energy complex (ENERGOATOM, Nizhnekamskneftekhim), construction (Gazflot, MonArch Group of Companies) and other areas. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0c5aa5">Questions as a conclusion</font> </h2><br>  The process of import substitution software after the adoption of the law is unlikely to be like a calm sailing on a cruise yacht.  Nevertheless, the prospects for import substitution seem to us to be very good for both the most energetic developers of domestic software, and for <a href="https://meduza.io/feature/2015/05/29/nestydnoe-importozameschenie">iron producers</a> . <br><br>  And how do you see the future of domestic software?  Do you agree with the fact that in the future we are waiting for not only difficulties, but also positive moments? <br><br>  <b>Previous posts:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smart_soft/blog/257829/">Choosing a corporate Internet gateway</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smart_soft/blog/255623/">Comparison of technical support of the largest software vendors in the field of network security</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smart_soft/blog/254741/">Traffic Inspector: full reboot</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259451/</a></p>
