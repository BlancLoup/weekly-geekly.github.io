What goals does he have?  And how are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/luxoft/blog/221153/">these trainings</a> going? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  About <a href="https://icagile.com/">ICAgile</a> </h5><br>  International Consortium ICAgile is a privately held company that supports continuing education in the field of Agile.  ICAgile was co-founded and supported by Alistair Coburn (one of the most famous and influential Agile practitioners, co-author and initiator of the Agile manifesto) and Ahmed Sidki (Author Agile Adoption Framework). <br>  The motivation for the creation of the consortium was to find the answer to the question ‚ÄúWhat skills do you need to learn in order to become a professional in the Agile community?‚Äù.  In this case, it does not matter if we are talking about a developer, tester, or business analyst.  We can say that ICAgile grew out of the need to bring together experts in the field of Agile to determine what people need to know in order to become experts in their fields. <br><br><h5>  What goals does ICAgile pursue? </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ The consortium acts as a catalyst company that collects, summarizes and classifies learning objectives, creating a roadmap for each Agile specialization. <br>  Recognized experts in the areas of agile and lean development work on this program - this ensures that each <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/luxoft/blog/221153/">course</a> and track gives a multifaceted insight into a particular discipline. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Accreditation of courses offered by training centers in accordance with the Roadmap. <br>  ICAgile does not conduct trainings on its own, but only accredits courses and trainers.  This makes it possible to contribute both to the development of the curriculum and to the dissemination of this knowledge. <br>  We must pay tribute to the fact that the consortium not only works out the training program in detail, but also evaluates each <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/luxoft/blog/221153/">coach and his course</a> in detail.  This allows you to equally open to the audience each topic, regardless of the coach. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Work with students on each of the specializations so that they receive certification and recognition as they progress through their training program. <br><br><h5>  What is the <a href="https://icagile.com/icagile-learning-roadmap">ICAgile Roadmap</a> training program <a href="https://icagile.com/icagile-learning-roadmap">?</a> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e71/5a9/35f/e715a935f943ba6cc20e1dc350f996aa.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The ICAgile Roadmap ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù begins with a deep study of the mindset (Agset fundamentals Track).  Understanding values ‚Äã‚Äãand principles is a fundamental position of Agile, without which further development is impossible. <br>  After obtaining the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/luxoft/blog/221153/">ICAgile Certified Professional</a> certificate, students can continue their training to gain in-depth knowledge in one or several areas, depending on their specialization. <br>  ICAgile experts are confident that Agile affects all process participants, be it a development team, team leaders, analysts, managers, or even sponsors.  Therefore, ICAgile Roadmap includes tracks not only for developers, testers, analysts, but even for managers at the level of CEO.

    <h5>  How are these trainings in Luxoft </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bda/9b0/1c1/bda9b01c17ed6dd78f4a03ea12dd365b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Luxoft is a partner (Member Training Organization) of the international consortium ICAgile, which indicates not only the opportunity to issue international ICAgile certificates, but also the detailed accreditation of our courses and trainers by leading experts in flexible software development. <br>  On May 20-22, an extended three-day ICAgile Certified Professional certification course will be held in St. Petersburg, designed to: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ To get acquainted with the full concept of the Agile-approach, to understand Agile as a way of thinking (mindset) and a general approach to the organization of development processes.  Participants will be able to learn to determine whether the level of interaction between people in their project is sufficient, improve it with simple methods and track the availability of a continuous supply stream of value to customers <br>  ‚Ä¢ Systematize knowledge on the basic principles of agile development (Agile) from the start of work on the project to the release and support of a working product <br>  ‚Ä¢ Introduce course participants to the main approaches to modern software development. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Receive an international certificate ICAgile, valid in all countries of the world and guaranteeing the quality and standardization of knowledge in your team <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbf/79c/bd2/bbf79cbd222e50d546c576d3c4aec206.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d14/c0a/fe4/d14c0afe4f79125e6859b944d3349dfa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/luxoft/blog/221153/">This course</a> includes a large number of games and exercises aimed at a deep understanding and acceptance of the whole Agile way of thinking, and not just practices and tools. <br>  Each training participant is actively involved in workshops, discussions and sharing their experiences.  This atmosphere contributes to a deeper understanding and memorization of the material. <br>  And, of course, at the end of the training, each participant will be presented with an international certificate and a thematic book. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3db/fcd/c7e/3dbfcdc7e4fe9c8aaeb94081289dff61.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222887/</a></p>
