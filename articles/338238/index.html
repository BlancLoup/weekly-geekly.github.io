Personal experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I am a simple person, I love work, especially if this work is for myself and without assistants.  I even went to school in the evening, because I worked during the day, and then sat until 6 in the morning behind a PC, understood 3DMax and Photoshop, riveted small mods for the games of that time and peered into the API of various old engines.  And the rest was the usual kid. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Time passed and after 10 years gained great experience in the game development environment.  But I couldn‚Äôt manage to apply this experience in any way, maybe it wasn‚Äôt lucky, maybe I just misbehaved with an employer who imagined Rokstar Geyms being in the village (well, really) and it all lasted until I found out what Unity. <br><br>  And that's the irony.  I studied a lot on the Unreal Engine, I was waiting for the release of the full version of UE4 and missed everything related to Unity.  I took it from offsite a couple of times, I don‚Äôt know, it seemed inconvenient, it pushed the interface away, I just took it down without understanding.  But in the end it was then that it was necessary to study it and cut it up and down, now I understand that.  But nothing can be done, the asset store from Unity today is replete with thousands of assets, scripts, models, textures, sounds and other things, and prices range from free to $ 500. <br><br>  Now starting to sell their assets there, it‚Äôs tantamount to start selling auto parts next to the auto parts store, and I also understand that there will always be a buyer for any product, but there will always be someone who sells the same thing only cheaper several times.  And that's exactly what I would like to talk about today.

      <br>
      First, I will talk about the section of 3D models, namely cars, in which, if I may say so, tried my hand myself.  I am a great motorist and the games of the GTA series, for all my experience, I modeled both for myself and hundreds of cars as mods.  He tore up a lot of games for ready-made car models, these were NFS, TDU, of course FM, but in general it doesn‚Äôt matter.  The fact is that I learned to see and define these models from others, well, it‚Äôs actually easier than it seems, you just have to mesh the meshes in Max or ZModeler to compare and everything will be clear, while the bold ones post their models in the sketchfab, and it‚Äôs like Known to see the grid (Sketchfab is a service that allows you to view 3D models with the ability to paste both on the site and on the asset store). <br><br>  After evaluating the market, the section I chose, the prices and the quality of the work, having communicated with the sellers personally, I understood what I need to earn so to speak in a quick way.  Yes, you can throw at me with sticks, but at first I got up on a not very good journey.  I modeled a couple of cars, but with the textures a little bit of a hangover, I typed from other sources.  But all the same, I started to launch into pending (Pending Review - like on many similar sites, this time for reviewing an asset is about 20 days on the UAS). <br><br>  Here I have to make some clarifications on the rules for accepting assets.  Firstly, in your asset, there must be a demoscene, prefabs must be for all meshes, all prefabs must have 0 in all coordinates and 1 in size.  By the way, recently they started demanding that within the prefabs all meshes were also of size 1, although, as I understood, not to all assets, perhaps they were just different moderators.  And by the way, for the 4th version of the unit, neither of which is practically for sale, so if you are still not updated, I advise you to do it.  And even if your asset has been rejected, you will definitely write the reason for the post office and you will not have much time to fix it, otherwise the more time you spend, the more time you will need to wait for re-examination.  If you managed everything in one day, then on the same night they would recheck. <br><br>  So back.  A month later, taking into account these requirements from their side, my assets rightly began to appear in the Store and I began to wait, updating the Sales tab almost every 15 minutes.  Two weeks passed and finally the first model for $ 30 was sold, I received a little more than $ 20, since they take 30 percent, but it didn‚Äôt bother me at all, I probably jumped to the ceiling.  Then another purchase and more, in the end, in 2 months (not counting the time of consideration) I managed to earn $ 160 with a penny.  And here it all started. <br><br>  Out of this money, I spent a few dollars on a domain name, made a website, loaded my models into a sketchfab.  Even made a few videos, everything turned out.  I modeled and launched into pending, developed the site and answered questions from customers.  But one fine moment after 3 months everything was covered. <br><br>  All my models were removed from the site, and declined status appeared in the admin panel.  I myself am guilty, teksturki needed to draw himself, especially since it would not take much time.  But I did not give up.  After appealing to the asset store, providing evidence that my models (as evidence, I used a fresh video where I was a model) and with an explanation of my school, we were able to resolve the issue.  I replaced the textures and my models reappeared on the sidelines.  But when I flooded the next model, it was rejected.  I received a message stating that they didn‚Äôt like my account history and that all assets were recalled again.  I couldn‚Äôt prove anything to them anymore, the account was closed, the site no longer exists, the skechfab account is empty. <br><br>  Sorry, such things.  Anyway.  At first, I was angry because I tried to prove to them that they were selling really stolen models on their website, showed mesh meshes, argued that I was selling a model and not textures, it even went as far as what I wrote directly to EA, in Criterion Games and ?  Almost all dishonest sellers in the auto section were blocked over this summer.  Of course, this is not only my merit, but not entirely merit; many people wrote there and on the forum about this, and there were many references to the forum.  What do you guys want?  This is a business. <br><br>  I did not give up, I do not have such a habit.  But here it is not rushing and that's it.  He started a big project according to all canons, it took 3 months to develop and ... cheaper and absolutely absurd models like a $ 5 road cone allow for sales and they are constantly updated in the tab, as they are updated every day, it really strains.  At the same time, the guys at the community say that their models were considered too simple and were rejected, although the models are very much so.  My project is quite expensive, but the quality is much higher than many there, even Unity said it when they took the asset, but it doesn‚Äôt go at all, even those who waited and watched this project all the time.  This question is puzzled by so many in the community who are doing really cool projects worthy of being more than in the tops and on the main page, but in the end they simply cannot be found at all by any tags.  Projects that were winners of various contests from a unit can hardly be discovered on their forum.  Of course, it is quite simple to unwrap an asset externally, usually an instagram is enough, but often it does not bring direct sales, only the community works best, Facebook and Twitter are the same situation, I will say more - my facebook account was blocked, I did not understand the reason, yes and did not understand, frankly. <br><br>  I learned a lot of lessons and learned a lot, today I make high-quality and great content for a good price.  I got connections through different social networks, I participate in contests, sometimes asses get to the tops of different social groups from Unity, I returned the site on a new domain and do advertising, lead branches with the development of my projects and fix them in time, my job.  Today, asset store brings me a small income, given that I have 3 large assets on the new account, and the most ambitious of them has not yet brought a single sale.  The income is quite small, but in principle stable and the next step will be the transfer of my assets to the UE Marketplace.  Soon I will certainly share with you the experience, since there moderation is more serious. <br><br>  And finally, I will say a little about the withdrawal of funds.  I have a Payoneer card and Unity has a Wire column, where the transfer of money to the card will cost $ 20, and the minimum withdrawal amount is $ 250.  There were no problems with PayPal, they are displayed automatically every 15 days without interest and delays.  In general, I like the service, even very much, but the people living there often do not want to appreciate the work of others, they post content for a ridiculous price with the use of other people's solutions and ideas, or worse, the content that does not belong to them.  But, this is a business.  Of course, there is that small part of people who, having the most minimal sales, still stand on their own, asking for their work 300, or even $ 500, such people only cause me respect.  Whoever makes himself and puts his soul - wants to bring something new, appreciates himself and his work. <br><br>  Believe in yourself.  Great success and sales. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338238/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338238/</a></p>
