      The market of "crypt" today is a constant speculation.  Most of the transactions - the purchase and sale of the currency itself.  Building a business based on such a market is almost impossible. <br>  High volatility of courses makes cryptocurrency uncomfortable for mutual settlements.  It is very difficult to evaluate goods and services in an asset, whose rate varies by several tens of percent per day. <br><br>  In addition, these two aspects are sharpened by linking to politics and information channels.  Any news about cryptocurrency can make the course plummet or grow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/58b/d1e/92e/58bd1e92e7e8431182b7cb832895d57e.jpg" alt="Problem 2: Capital Preservation"><br><br>  At first glance, the market is full of financial instruments for the accumulation and preservation of capital: stocks, banks, own business, foreign currencies, ‚Äúcrypt‚Äù, and even real estate and metals.  But all of them are subject to various risks. <br><br>  It is very difficult to choose between the options - each sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfeatures that needs to be studied: there is not always time and energy for this.  Some of the tools are related to legal, linguistic and geolocation difficulties.  There is practically no transparency and guarantees on the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c30/e31/639/c30e316397584e018afbc6927e19c461.jpg" alt="Problem 3: Cryptocurrencies are hard to understand"><br><br>  The cryptocurrency market has shielded itself from ordinary users with a wall.  The threshold of entry - as in higher mathematics.  You need to know a lot about coins, to understand and be able to calculate risks.  In addition, the "crypt" inside is a set of contradictions and problems. <br><br>  High commissions on deposit and withdrawal, security problems of ‚Äúcloud‚Äù wallets and centralized exchanges, slow confirmation of transactions in existing coins.  One of the reasons for creating a blockchain was to resolve the issue of reducing transaction costs - as a result, we have more than 800 all kinds of cryptocurrencies, and the situation has not become better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/06e/5cd/4bd/06e5cd4bdf054413aa2fc17fcaa1c582.jpg" alt="Problem 4: There is no output of cryptocurrency in the real world"><br><br>  With this - all the trouble.  As we have said, from the side of the market "crypt" resembles a huge financial bubble.  Its growth is provided solely by speculative methods, and all new products aimed at the development of the market are focused on its internal problem and needs. <br><br>  Cryptocurrencies simply do not have access to the real world.  There is no binding from the real sector, there is no project that will move the market and provide this binding.  There is not even a stable coin.  The market itself is becoming more complex, and because of this growing misunderstanding of his mechanic work.  Hence the negative image of the financial pyramid, fueled by the media and ‚Äúsofa analysts.‚Äù <br><br><h2>  <font color="#8b6c00">How do we solve these problems?</font> </h2><br>  We do not offer to evaluate our idea and believe in its reality - everything has already been done and is ready to launch.  XRONOS Aggregator are three products (Wallet, Blockchain and XRSS), working together on a comprehensive solution to the above problem list.  Our Wallet is simple and safe.  The self-optimizing Blockchain and the network device provide at least 100 transactions per second at the available capacity and linearly scale with increasing needs.  Finally, XRSS will provide the long-awaited capitalization of coins and will become the driver of cryptocurrency growth. <br><br>  For normal operation, the system needs an array of users, and it can only be attracted if played according to the rules of a speculative market.  Therefore, we have created 4 unique stabilization stages: 2 Presale and 2 ICO with the gradual growth of the coin rate. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a64/07f/cba/a6407fcba2334131876230ff61f8729c.png"></div><br>  We not only give them the opportunity to touch our technologies with their hands, but we also offer to make money on it.  Moreover, it is the first in the history of Presale and ICO with transparent conditions and guarantees of refunds.  You trust - XRONOS pays for it.  Did not like # testdriveXRSS - take the money.  Like - get income. <br><br>  The final result of our activity will be the creation of the first truly stable cryptocurrency, which will open the doors of the cryptocurrency market in the real economy. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#8b6c00">Where are the details?</font> </h2><br>  During the week we will regularly upload information about the project: we will tell about each product, show technical documentation, answer any questions and give a full announcement of the upcoming Presale and ICO new cryptocurrency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/69e/bdc/f66/69ebdcf66db944378f39eae8e10e43de.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the meantime, the most curious can find information on our <a href="https://www.xronos.space/">official website</a> . <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> If you are interested in cryptocurrency theme - do not forget to subscribe <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/xronos/">to our blog</a> .
