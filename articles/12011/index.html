  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Web 2.0 - the origin, designation, development ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The term Web 2.0 became just ubiquitous, it broke into everyday life ... And what does it mean, because everyone understands it differently: for whom it is a means of earning, for whom it is a buzzword (special term geek), for someone social internet networks, for whom is the meaning of life ... <br>  And where did he come from and what does it mean, who are his ancestors?  Immediately I want to note that no specifically <a name="habracut"></a>  social and professional networks it does not mean.  Where did he come from this term?  It was once said by Tim O'Reilly for the first time, and a huge number of services appeared in the world, the creators of which can say that they were made within the framework of this concept.  Social news sites have become one of the most popular destinations.  Then came the technology RSS, RDF and Atom, FLV ... <br>  <u>So, I dare to suggest that Tim mutually "2.0", yes, yes, USB 2.0.</u>  <u>Thus, USB 2.0 is the forefather of Web 2.0 (at last, then!).</u>  USB 2.0 itself in relation to usb 1.1 means a higher throughput speed, which was the means of the emergence of new fast-working devices compatible with USB 2, such as photo-video-audio, printers, scanners ... <br>  <u>All devices are not connected directly to usb 2.0, but when this standard appeared for a very long time it was fashionable to say (3-5 years ago) that my device and PC supports USB 2.0.</u>  <u>So USB 2.0 symbolized a higher speed, less power consumption, and as a result, the standard is the de facto ball-in device in the world.</u> <br><br>  To our web 2.0.  Similarities.  Photo, video camera with USB 2.0 - this is if by analogy of Picasa, YouTube, etc. <br><br>  <em><u>Thus, Web 2.0 - just first line shows broadband, the appearance of optical fiber, without which no YouTube with gigs of information and other services would exist, if not an optical fiber, people with modems downloaded a 5-minute video for months.</u></em>

      And in the 2 nd stage, this is an opportunity to create software like CloudWare, such as Google Maps, Google Docks, etc., for which there is no need to install.  This feature is a consequence of higher bandwidth.  Modern Web OS is ordinary Internet services with / without RSS, with / without a player ... For this platform (Web OS), internet speed is required comparing with the hard drive speed, and not every 200 kbps, and not even 2 Mb / s otherwise it all - the usual banal sites with different elements. <br><br>  <strong>And in 3 (AND THIS IS MOST IMPORTANT).</strong>  I would like to wish people less to dwell on this term, try to create something fundamentally new, be a pioneer of any service or application, as for example at one time it was eBay, YouTube, Yahoo, MySpace and of course Apple and Microsoft without which the Web 1.0 (none other than the familiar dotCOM) did not take place. <br>  Good luck and success to all!  Create your original! <br><br>  I also want to say to all those who promoted my habrakarm many thanks, I hope that I did not let you down, that you did not do it in vain, and that I managed to say something new. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12011/</a></p>
