  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Radmin. Greeting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Good afternoon, dear habravchane!</b> <br><br>  Each of you must know what remote access programs are and why they are needed.  This blog is dedicated to one of these programs, which, I think, does not need a special presentation.  Appearing 11 years ago, Radmin became very popular both in Russia and far beyond its borders.  He speaks in 27 languages ‚Äã‚Äãall over the world that remote control of computers can be safe, fast and simple as a keystroke. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This blog is designed to share practical tips, guides, subtleties and tricks of using programs to remotely control computers in any situation.  We will try to tell you how to effectively solve various tasks related to system administration, the provision of technical support, and the deployment of integrated software in distributed networks of various sizes.  We will also talk about the basic mechanisms for setting up and working on Radmin, as well as about new, unusual solutions, conducting version testing, giving presents, and, of course, telling us what's interesting!  On the sidelines of Habr, we will talk about Radmin a little more than on the official website and we will be able to exchange experience together.  Moreover, some of the authors of our blog are familiar to you habravchane, professional programmers, who were at the forefront of creating this wonderful program.

      <b>From the sources ...</b> <br><br>  Did you know that Radmin was born in Russia more than 11 years ago?  The author of the first version, a talented programmer Dmitry Znosko, at that time was graduating from Moscow State University, and to write a diploma he needed a program that would allow him to connect to a remote server.  It took six months of hard work before the task was solved.  So Radmin appeared, which quickly scattered over friends and acquaintances, first conquered America, and then Russia, to which information technology progress came a little later.  Since then, Dmitry is the owner of Famatech, the flagship product of which is Radmin. <br><br>  <b>Safety is most important ...</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúRadmin has a‚Äú paranoid ‚Äùsecurity system, and breaking it is more expensive,‚Äù said an American hacker.  Once we held a competition among programmers and hackers around the world: we offered a reward to someone who can access Radmin installed on a public server on the Internet.  After numerous attempts, no one ever managed to hack the Radmin authentication system.  There were even attempts to hack the hoster, which also failed.  Over the entire lifetime of the program, no vulnerabilities have been found in Radmin and there are no exploits to use them.  Not many remote access programs can boast that. <br><br>  We welcome questions, as well as suggestions for topics for our posts and discussions.  Offer them in the comments, and we will immediately reveal them. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br><br>  Natalya Grigorieva </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110085/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110085/</a></p>
