Why?  Yes, because I'm so used. <br><br>  I use IE.  I use the Opera, and sometimes Firevoks.  I tried almost all the programs that come out, especially the large ones.  When I encounter a problem, I look for a program, find a few and leave the one I like. <br>  I leave it because it is more convenient for me.  I do not care deeply who and what is capable of.  If the program can fly, but I have to go, then I choose the one that allows me to go comfortably.  Even if she can fly.  When I want to fly, I will look for a program to fly. <br><br>  I use Windows.  Because it is so convenient and practical for me.  It is more convenient for me both for work and for personal entertainment.  At least because I work a lot with video editing.  And compose music.  And I do websites, and I get on the Internet, and I communicate, and there is a lot more that.  I am not a narrowly specialized user - I am comprehensive, but at the moment there is no such platform so that I feel comfortable, comfortable and the flies do not bite.  Viruses?  So do not go wherever they do not ask.  When you receive a letter from classmates, do not you see that it does not lead to classmates ru?  Good, complete substitution.  But I don‚Äôt know such a person - I‚Äôm just not going to click on a link just out of curiosity.  Yes, I have an antivirus, there is one that I again chose a sample of medication - and left the one I like.  It is convenient for me.

      The taste and color, as they say. <br><br>  We can all argue for a long time about comforts, about lamer industry, about strengths and what is measured by something.  But try to look at everything through the eyes of a simple user.  Advanced users are few, gurus - on the fingers.  And often they try to argue, prove, throw slang, sometimes without even realizing what is happening and what it really is. <br>  Yes, "program 1" is cool, it only works pro!  But let's say I'm not a pro.  Yes, even if I am a pro - I do not care that she is number one.  The main thing - I should be comfortable, and everything should be at hand. <br><br>  I have been in this industry for a long time.  I recently on Habr√©.  Why?  Yes, because it was more convenient for me. <br>  For 10 years I have done more than one program, not a single site, not a single design.  I always didn‚Äôt care what was right and what wasn‚Äôt - the main thing was that it all worked, it worked quickly, clearly and clearly.  Customers have always been satisfied.  Everything I did was a pleasure.  Then it turned into my work.  I began to live it.  Agree, if you do what you like, and get paid for it - this is what you need. <br>  But I never forgot one rule - should be comfortable.  It is convenient to each user, and to the one who sits for my work for the first time.  That was all clear and understandable from the first time. <br><br>  He does not care what ways it is done - he is pleased with what he can do about it.  Therefore, I probably do exactly what the customer asks.  It is more convenient for him - because he works in this, and not all the rest. <br><br>  Watching the last time what they write, I come to the conclusion that most of the people do not care about the user - they do what they think is ‚Äúright‚Äù <br><br>  But we are doing it not for ourselves, but for people.  Look at your work from the user's point of view.  Look at how it works. <br>  And you should always remember this word - it is convenient.  Not a word is necessary.  And the word CONVENIENT. <br><br>  Because I like to work like that.  I feel so comfortable and so used to it. <br><br>  pysy.  This is my IMHO.  I ask in advance all those who want to prove again, with foaming at the mouth, that ‚Äúit‚Äôs just that - cool, the rest is bullshit‚Äù just close this text, and move on to more convenient texts for you, where you can argue)) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26736/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26736/</a></p>
