Someone considers this event a complete file in the entire history of Apple.  Someone on the contrary was delighted with the new devices.  Personally, I was more upset by the change in the form factor of the new iPod nano.  But first things first. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I‚Äôll start with a small negative about new iPod nano.  Why, tell me, is it such a big screen and ‚Äúhome‚Äù button?  They doubled the size of the device!  I think those who need a compact video player and the ability to run applications will choose iPod touch for themselves, and iPod nano was convenient for another.  And where is the clip?  How to attach it to clothes now?

      Personally, I expected that they would simply reduce the thickness of the device, and in fact I didn‚Äôt need anything else.  No matter how pathetic it sounded, but the device was perfect as it was.  And after the press conference, I had the thought to run and buy myself another ‚Äúold‚Äù iPod nano, while they were still being sold, so to speak, ‚Äúprozapas‚Äù. <br><br>  And now my little essay on the experience of using iPod 2010 nano model. <br><br>  I have never been a fan of Apple, and by the way, it so happened that I never had their devices.  But this spring I had the idea to actively go in for sports, namely running.  What can I say, it is very healthy.  But just running is not interesting, I would like to have a device that would at least consider the distance that I ran and the time spent.  I began to look towards specialized devices.  But firstly, their price, to put it mildly, was not adequate, and secondly, they somehow did not impress me with their capabilities.  I just knew nothing about iPod nano back then.  And quite by chance from my friend I found out about this wonderful device.  And I immediately felt an urge to purchase it and quite quickly accomplished this venture. <br><br>  Friends, as soon as iPod nano fell into my hands, I immediately just fell in love with it!  Not only does it know how to count the distance traveled and time, it also shows the approximate cost of calories!  Something fantastic came into my hands!  A device with a pleasantly cooling metal to the touch, with rounded edges and without visible fasteners, as if created using some kind of alien technology.  And besides, with a touch screen!  By the way, this is how I imagined the devices of the future back in the distant school years. <br><br>  Earlier, when I tried to run, I felt like I was wasting my time.  ‚ÄúYes, of course, everything is good for health,‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúbut it would not have been better if I spent this time developing my abilities, such as learning foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand reading literature.‚Äù  And the exit was immediately found, I began to listen to audiobooks while running!  Thus, while running, I learn English or listen to some interesting literature (Hawking books, for example).  Earlier, I never had enough time to get all this knowledge, and now I combine essentially three useful lessons at the same time: 1) I go in for sports;  2) I get new knowledge;  3) I spend time in nature (I live on the edge of the city, right near the forest belt, and I run there). <br><br>  And here it began!  I began to run regularly.  The most amazing thing is that I didn‚Äôt even want to miss my workouts (although I had not once tried running, but I didn‚Äôt have enough for a long time).  I started running from 10 minutes (in the 10th minute I actually fell to the ground, gasping for breath) and now I‚Äôve taken the running time to 1 hour. <br><br>  To my surprise, I began to get great pleasure from running!  Now, after 4 months of regular classes, I can not imagine how I used to live without it.  For 4 months I have seen dramatic changes in the quality of life.  I forgot something such shortness of breath and lost 10 pounds.  Besides, I don‚Äôt part with iPod nano at all and listen to books on the go or while shopping at the supermarket. <br><br>  And in conclusion of this article, the thought occurred to me that without exaggeration this is the most useful (in all senses) device that I have ever bought! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151528/</a></p>
