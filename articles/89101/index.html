The new operating system already has more than 600 web applications available that are ready for everyday tasks.  Also, the system is fast and supports HTML5.  Particularly interesting is the fact of the transition from the old Mozilla engine to the new one, in the light of the fact that Google itself is going to release Chrome OS for netbooks soon, with the support of iron manufacturers.  Will the attempts of the open source project Jolicloud succeed in occupying a niche and provide the user with an interesting alternative?  Or will this OS be another failed project in the race for primacy in cloud systems? <br><br>  Jolicloud has always been a company for which it was interesting to watch.  Long before Google publicly announced its netbook-centric OS, Jolicloud had already modeled and delivered its future, in which computers run applications running on the Internet, rather than in a local environment.  Jolicloud OS promises to introduce a new concept in computer use, and this concept is ‚Äúcloudy‚Äù. <br><br>  With an extremely simple interface, Jolicloud allows you to launch a browser and use applications such as Twitter, Facebook, Gmail, Skype, Boxee, Meebo, Dropbox and hundreds of other applications.  Unfortunately or not, Google Chrome OS will do exactly the same thing.  And absolutely unfortunately for Jolicloud, Chrome OS will have the power of Google‚Äôs brand.

      <b>So what remains Jolicloud?</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Benefit from Google‚Äôs mistakes <br><br>  If something could turn in favor for Jolicloud, then this is, of course, recent stories with a new service <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz">Buzz</a> , after which Google had to apologize to users.  Too much private information, taken from all the resources indicated by the user, turned out to be accessible to anyone.  Nothing, maybe, did not happen if this setting was not enabled by default.  The journalists who covered this problem were very unhappy, to say the least, because their top-secret data became available to anyone who found it difficult to use the search. <br><br>  Despite this blunder, which will soon be forgotten, Google still has several services available that allow the user to maintain their privacy.  For example, the company recently introduced a new way to allow web surfers to stop tracking through Google Analytics.  Also, the web-board service was launched at the end of last year in response to the growing fears of users about how and what information is stored in the Google database.  This service, involuntarily reminiscent of how many aspects of your life affect Google, allows you to set up multiple accounts of various services.  (If you haven‚Äôt looked at this simple page yet, be sure to check it out: <a href="http://www.google.com/dashboard">www.google.com/dashboard</a> - open your eyes). <br><br>  In the case of Jolicloud, these online privacy issues can only play into her hands.  Like Chrome OS, it is also based on the open source project, which in the future will become the Google web axis, but Jolicloud has the advantage that ... it ... well, not Google, in general.  ;) <br><br>  This ambitious company has no problem of great responsibility to the whole world, and therefore it can safely apply and implement interesting ideas in its creation.  And as a matter of fact, Jolicloud can be that adapter in the field of simple and cheerful use of netbooks. <br><br>  Of course, it should be said that the real success of Jolicloud will not depend on these ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù, but on what contracts can be signed with netbook manufacturers.  Various rumors may be circulating, but no official statements have yet been made.  In the end, only users will decide whether netbooks are better with Jolicloud than with Chrome OS or not. <br><br>  The first company, however, has another possible outcome - to be bought by Google.  And we know that Google absorbs only interesting projects. <br><br>  PS This translation was written by my friend for <a href="http://osbygoogle.ru/">my site</a> , if someone has an extra invite, could you invite him to Habr.
