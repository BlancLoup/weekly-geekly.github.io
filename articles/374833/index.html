  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quadcopter test with online broadcast to the console for $ 103.99</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About 3 weeks ago, I talked about how I chose " <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/246926/">quadrocopter with video transmission for $ 100</a> " and the quadcopter <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/z9">I chose</a> ( <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/z9">WLtoys V686G</a> ) finally arrived from the sky just before my visit to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/248038/">TechTrendsExpo</a> , which took place this weekend. <br><br>  I decided to combine primary testing and visiting the exhibition and the organizers kindly agreed to help me with this.  Under the cut the first impressions of the WLtoys V686G, video of flights and photos of the quadrocopter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc4/86e/880/fc486e88052f4012bd598fbf0fbfb9d6.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing that caught my eye was an inverted box.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/091/dd6/747/091dd674704642b5b9c6a58623c53823.jpg"><br><br>  If I understood everything correctly, then this is protection from customs, so that no one would guess that there is something valuable in the package.  But maybe they just mixed up the sides and decided to surprise me.  Thank them for it, surprised. <br><br>  It should be said that the quadcopter itself pleased with its appearance and colors: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ece/e64/541/ecee6454164749a793c8f99f1ad3b553.jpg"><br><br>  The sensations from the first flights are amazing, although it is absolutely impossible to fly indoors through FPV.  Yes, and not necessary.  Sometimes you glance at the picture in order to evaluate what exactly your quadrocopter shoots and continue to try not to drop it on the crowd of assembled onlookers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24e/c21/a66/24ec21a666a144ddaa9b6d6c5e952e37.jpg"><br><br>  I was pleased with the stability, frankly speaking, I didn‚Äôt even begin to calibrate it, because the stability of the flight out of the box was quite accurate and taking off for the first time - I didn‚Äôt want to get back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5d/bee/475/a5dbee47520142c9a47337d5d6a82c60.jpg"><br><br>  It is impossible not to notice the similarities with his "elder brother" - DJI Phantom.  It is of course much smaller in size.  but on the other hand, the brightness of the backlight can be envied by a phantom, which means that it is much easier to control them at a considerable distance, since it is always clear where the red lights are and where the lights are green. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a7/9ac/145/3a79ac1453b94ffe93b280f2c2a263b9.jpg"><br><br>  The truth is not necessary fanaticism, when you are fascinated by the height - unpleasant things happen.  I‚Äôve already had quadrocopters flying twice, my first and favorite DJI Phantom flew for the first time and I described this incident in the article " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/216791/">Buy a quadrocopter and say goodbye to him</a> ."  For the use of referral links on Habr√© I was banned, but the article was restored for your viewing, thanks to them for it (by the way, does anyone have an invite for me?) <br><br>  More recently, I entrusted my friend with the management of the Syma X5C quadrocopter, which was in the article <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/246036/">Three Budget quadrocopters with cameras in the Kolomenskoye Historical Museum</a> and was also lost somewhere in the sky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/424/189/fd3/424189fd35eb450dbf4b10b9402c1ec6.JPG"><br><br>  But back to the WLtoys V686G <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa5/942/bc8/fa5942bc831847e7957ae6fbec60346d.jpg"><br><br>  In the last article I chose a quadrocopter based on parameters, now it‚Äôs time to test them in practice: <br><br>  <b>The price of</b> WLtoys V686G is kept at a past level - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/z9">$ 103.99</a> (this is given my promotional code, which I will issue in a personal to everyone) <br><br>  <b>The camera is</b> declared 2.0 MP and I would like to speak about its quality separately, as she was very pleasantly surprised!  Honestly, I did not expect that such a cheap camera could shoot at least some decent video, but no - you can really use the video to see what the camera saw and the objects are quite distinguishable. <br><br>  A small video with my flights: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1AOnoIN62o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjNel16UtaUgNcomtXB-rIthXFQMg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Separately pleased flips on it.  The copter can do flips almost without sagging, which is much better than the same Syma X5.  And of course it makes the flight more fun, and your friends will be delighted.  Plus, the camera shoots well during stunts. <br><br>  On the street, I was talking badly because the winds in Moscow are now almost hurricane, but in general I think you can evaluate the quality of the camera for shooting indoors and outdoors.  My rating: above average. <br><br>  <b>The size</b> turned out to be slightly smaller than I expected, but these are honest 200 * 200 * 93 mm, so there is nothing to complain about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ece/e64/541/ecee6454164749a793c8f99f1ad3b553.jpg"><br><br>  Flight time corresponds to the declared characteristics - about 8 minutes.  This is normal for this quadcopter class.  We stock up on batteries and fly at your pleasure. <br><br>  Separately, I note the function of returning home.  There is no GPS here of course, but it flies perfectly on the compass and knows where to return if necessary. <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  Easy to manage.  Native camera at a decent level.  Flips are made very simply (by pressing a button) and without losing height.  You can play around with the monitor and control what the quadcopter shoots, but I would only risk flying with it over a long distance with a GPS tracker on board, since the flight distance with a video signal is no more than 100 meters.  True, if you think in advance that you can use the return home function, then when the signal disappears, you can return it by compass. <br><br>  In general, a great option for the first quadcopter or for the first more or less serious quadcopter, but still in the role of a toy and a training piloting model. <br><br>  ps I ordered it for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/z9">$ 103.99</a> with a special promotional code for a discount.  Who will be useful - skin in a personal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374833/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374833/</a></p>
