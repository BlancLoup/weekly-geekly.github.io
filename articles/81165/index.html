  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wireless power transmission: is the future here?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The principles of transmitting power without wires were discovered as early as the nineteenth century.  In the 1890s, the famous scientist Nikola Tesla carried out wireless transmission of energy at a distance in his experiments.  The principle of operation of wireless transmission of electricity is based on the resonance mechanism, that is, the phenomenon of a sharp increase in the amplitude of forced oscillations, which occurs when the frequency of external influence approaches some values ‚Äã‚Äã(resonant frequencies) determined by the properties of the system.  However, when two objects have equal resonance indices, they can exchange energy. <br>  In nature, there are many examples of resonance.  The most famous is that when several identical glass glasses are filled with different amounts of water, if each glass is tapped with a metal spoon, then each glass will emit a unique sound.  After many years of interest to this problem arose again.  Instead of acoustic resonance, physicists use the frequency resonance of electromagnetic waves.  There are two small electric coils in the charging unit, which resonate in the frequency range of 10 MHz and exchange electricity and the longer the interaction between the elements, the more current the receiver arrives. <br>  Moreover, the lower the resonance range, the more long-wave range as a result is obtained and the greater the distance between the receiver and the transmitter can be.  It is assumed that by 2014-2015, such systems can be found in almost every home - they will power PCs, phones, players and other consumer electronics.  At the same time, in 2010 the industry will pay close attention to these technologies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>From theory to practice</b> </h4><br><br>  Established in early 2009, the consortium to develop a standard for wireless transmission of electricity includes Fulton Innovation, ConvenientPower, Duracell, Hosiden, Leggett &amp; Platt, National Semiconductor, Olympus, Philips, Samsung, Sanyo, Shenzhen Sangfei Consumer Communications, ST-Ericsson and Texas Instruments . <br>  They have already developed a standard 0.95 Wireless Power - the first version of the official specification of wireless transmission of electricity, as well as the official logo, which will be placed on wireless charging devices.  Wireless Power provides for wireless transmission of up to 5 watts, which is enough to charge the player, camera or cell phone. <br>  Separate from the consortium to create a new technology that will allow mobile phones to be charged from electromagnetic radiation in the environment, scientists from Nokia‚Äôs research center in Cambridge are working. <br>  The technology invented by them works on the same principle as RFID - the method used in contactless smart cards and electronic tags on goods in stores - and is capable of converting electromagnetic waves into an electrical signal.  Nokia already has a prototype of a device that can collect up to 5 milliwatts of energy ‚Äúfrom the air‚Äù.  For any prolonged mobile phone operation, this is not enough, but the developers promise a solution that can get at least 50 milliwatts from the surrounding electromagnetic radiation. <br>  The development of such systems are engaged in other companies, such as Intel.  The first prototypes of wireless chargers were demonstrated in early 2009 at the same CES in Las Vegas. <br>  Later last year, Qualcomm presented at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona a prototype of a wireless charger that would charge items on it, such as a mobile phone. <br>  Palm has also released a wireless charger for its Pre.  This device, called Touchstone, must still be plugged in, but to charge the battery to its owners, it is enough just to put the phone on the stand. <br>  However, there are already devices that allow mobile devices to be recharged using the power of wireless networks.  Most recently, RCA has demonstrated the first serial wireless charger.  One of the new products shown at the CES 2010 consumer electronics show in Los Angeles was RCA's Airnergy device, which charges cell phones, PDAs and other handheld equipment ‚Äúfrom the air,‚Äù or rather from Wi-Fi signals.  RCA has demonstrated that its charger can charge a BlackBerry smartphone for a third in 90 minutes, but, of course, the actual achievable charging speed depends on the strength of the Wi-Fi signal in a given location. <br>  RCA is already working on a second-generation device, which should be compact enough to replace the standard battery in the battery compartment of a mobile phone.  It is argued that RCA Airnergy is the first serial embodiment of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtransmitting and receiving energy at a distance by means of an electromagnetic field. <br>  A gadget the size of a mobile phone collects Wi-Fi 802.11 wireless signals (2.4 GHz frequency) and converts them into direct current.  It charges the built-in battery, and from it, if necessary, you can refill the phone, handheld computer or player, for which Airnergy is equipped with a Micro USB connector. <br><br>  Is there a wireless future ahead?  Mobile phones that do not need to be plugged in for recharging sockets, cordless lights, irons, computers, other household appliances? </div>
