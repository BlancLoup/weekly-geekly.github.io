  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Seven Great Secrets Manager. Substitute number when outgoing from mobile. New AltegroCloud features</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Everything flows, everything changes, everything is updated.  Trying to keep up with the rapidly expanding cloud-based IP PBX market, our AltegroCloud has been updated to the next version.  It seems that nothing unexpected or deserving of the increased attention of the respected readers of the Altegro blog has happened - updating is a common thing and any cloud project is simply obliged to improve the functionality, edit old bugs and create new ones, at least in order to keep the developers and clients of the service in good shape .  But in our case there is one peculiarity: AltegroCloud is tightly integrated with mobile communications, which means that each new cloud-based phone ‚Äúbun‚Äù is automatically available on mobile phones integrated into the cloud platform using special AltegroSIM SIM cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1f/8c0/5de/d1f8c05de7394a719cabeae4c698b815.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's briefly go over those key features of Cloud that were ‚Äúsawed‚Äù by the whole team of developers on long winter nights, and ‚Äúsawed‚Äù in partnership with the productologists of one of the most respected mobile operators. <br><br>  <a href="http://altegrocloud.ru/">AltegroCloud</a> provides two types of subscriber devices - the most common IP phones (or softphones), which use the widely known SIP protocol in narrow circles and special <a href="http://altegrosim.ru/">FMC sim cards</a> tricky ‚Äúloaded‚Äù over the same SIP protocol with the platform‚Äôs communication core.  From the point of view of a virtual PBX, such a SIM card looks like a normal IP phone, is registered on an internal extension using a login password, and all calls from / to such a SIM card fall into this same PBX, which means it can be recorded, heard, in statistics and will be processed by all voice scenarios.  The sim card is assigned a short number from the internal numbering plan of the company and the sim card works in the same way as the office telephone on the table at the manager.  It is clear that no Internet connection is used, calls are transferred from the GSM network to the SIP network directly, having completed a complex route both on the mobile operator side and on the side of our platform.  We are able to manage Caller ID transmissions from SIM cards at our discretion, we are able to correctly show caller ID of an A subscriber with an incoming (short or federal number), i.e. we do everything that we usually do with VoIP devices with SIM cards.  Now the fixed and mobile phones in the company are a union of indestructible devices disparate.

      <b>Schematically it looks like this:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ea/323/486/4ea323486ff64b8a972106119b30e1ac.png"><br><br>  We have already written many times about the ‚Äúgoodies" that can be made with such a solution on our blog and today we will describe a couple of interesting features that became available after the next update of AltegroCloud. <br><br>  What has been added and what can we do now?  From the point of view of the functionality of the usual IP-PBX, it seems to be nothing special, but if you connect SIM cards to the scheme, which are used by traveling employees as work phones, you get a couple of very interesting moments. <br><br>  Actually, about new features: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac6/caf/b43/ac6cafb43e344b9686d85afc30fcaf2a.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Feature one:</b> notification of missed calls to email. <br><br>  Our cloud is now able to send information about all missed incoming calls to the company to the pre-installed email.  The client, Anatoly Anatolyevich, at 10 am insistently dials the manager Oleg, in order to once again change the order made the day before (naturally, downwards), Oleg, knowing the greed of Anatoly Anatolyevich, categorically refuses to take the phone (got it).  Humanly, Oleg can be understood, but from a business point of view, he is not right.  The client must be loved and the missed call is an unacceptable evil, even if it is a call from Anatoly Anatolyevich. <br><br>  The head of Oleg, Anna Vladimirovna, knowing the intolerable nature of the burned-down manager, had previously set up sending notifications of missed calls to his internal number to his email.  Oleg is under special control, Oleg doesn‚Äôt have anything else but to always answer the calls, otherwise his KPI will suffer with all the consequences. <br><br>  Add intrigue and set up notifications about Oleg missed and on his mobile phone.  Using SIM cards AltegroSIM is as easy as setting up a notification of a missed on a fixed phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cc/57f/11f/5cc57f11fd3d4321bf35397827647de4.jpeg"><br><br>  What got in the end: <br><br>  <i>- Oleg in the office and for some reason did not answer the call to the city - a notification of the missed flies instantly to where it should be and where it should be, draw appropriate conclusions and take appropriate measures.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Oleg went to the meeting and went to the mobile, but we continue to monitor the missed and on his mobile phone.</i>  <i>Notification of the missed on the cell will also be sent to the chief‚Äôs email.</i>  <i>Now, Oleg Petrovich, no excuses - "I did not hear, did not see, I missed."</i>  <i>Must call back and point.</i>  <i>And if you did not do it - minus 10% of the salary.</i>  <i>Because we see the whole history of your calls from a mobile in the statistics of the PBX and we know all your missed.</i>  <i>It is cruel, but fair - Simka is corporate and we have the right.</i> <br><br>  However, the notification email of the missed does not necessarily use only for punitive purposes, it can often help just in time to eliminate the lost lead. <br><br>  <b>Feature two:</b> managing outgoing numbers or changing Caller ID. <br><br>  By default, for outgoing calls from managers to customers, customers have a single company number.  It is clear that in case of using AltegroSIM SIM cards, the same number will also be determined when calling from corporate mobile.  This is convenient and often helps to build business processes correctly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e9/160/2d2/5e91602d2be74a7bba4b7ac68c2c3262.jpeg"><br><br>  And if the company has several numbers, and even in different regions?  And if you need when calling to different numbers (which are, for example, in CRM) substitute different Caller ID? <br><br>  What is called, "no problem."  Now this option has appeared in the Cloud settings: you can assign a number that will be determined for outgoing calls from your company's phones (including mobile employees), depending on the region of call direction or depending on the dialed number. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ce/59b/aef/6ce59baef01d4277b9d91ab926d260e5.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>What we get:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/646/658/4c7/6466584c704a446b80d7801c370406f9.jpeg"><br>  The manager, Oleg Petrovich, works with all regions of Russia; Oleg has a whole web of partners, customers and suppliers.  Oleg built such clever sales schemes that customers from Ivanovo are convinced that he is sitting in an office in Ivanovo, and customers from Tyumen have even seen Oleg in his meeting room, while Oleg Petrovich himself is located in an office in Moscow.  The numbers of all the necessary regions were acquired from Oleg‚Äôs company in advance and they can be ‚Äúshined‚Äù.  In the Cloud settings, we simply specify which number is determined when calling to each specific region.  Moreover, Oleg Petrovich, leaving the office, can calmly continue to call the right people from the mobile phone.  When outgoing from a cell phone, this rule will also work - when calling to Tyumen, the Tyumen number will be substituted, when calling to Ivanovo - the number of Ivanovo, when calling to Moscow - the number of Moscow. <br><br>  We will somewhat complicate the task - we want not only to substitute different numbers when calling to different regions, we want to substitute certain numbers when calling to different numbers even within the same region.  This is also possible if we know in advance which number and to whom we should show - for example, we take numbers from CRM integrated with our Cloud.  Then the matter of technology and no magic. <br><br>  Oleg Petrovich is recruiting Anatoly Anatolyevich from his corporate cellular mobile phone; Anatoly Anatolyevich is a client who has been working with Oleg for 10 years.  Anatoly Anatolyevich of his and he can show the number of corporate mobile phone.  If you call back at the weekend - do not worry.  Almost certainly buy something.  We create a rule: when calling to Anatoly‚Äôs number, we‚Äôll show Oleg Petrovich‚Äôs corporate mobile number. <br><br>  When calling to corporate cellular work colleagues, we show a short internal PBX number.  Why frighten a colleague with long rows of numbers, let him know that they are calling. <br><br>  When calling from a mobile phone to the number of a new client, who was dropped by SMS secretary Tatiana, for the first time we will show the general number of the company.  So convenient and correct.  Then, if a new client turns into a permanent one, we will add it to the CPM and we will show Oleg‚Äôs real cellular.  Oleg has been in sales for 10 years and if every client of his will call Oleg on his mobile phone at least once a week - Oleg will simply hang on the phone 24/7. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7a/eb1/3d4/d7aeb13d4f084ff4bd2ab0e75c2716d1.jpeg"><br>  In the presence of imagination, the scheme can be strongly modified and sharpened for different business processes.  Outgoing numbers can be substituted depending on the time of day, the weather outside the window, the exchange rate or nationality of the client.  True, this will require the CPM, which needs to be integrated with AltegroCloud (the API is well developed) and in which you need to set up the necessary rules. <br><br>  Traditionally: to be continued ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268167/</a></p>
