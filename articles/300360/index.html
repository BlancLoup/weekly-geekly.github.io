  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Productivity for digital transformation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The need to move to digital business today is acutely recognized by many companies.  And this <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/hpe/blog/24780/">task is</a> multifaceted.  It is not only about finding the most effective ways to work with data that will help improve workflows, better understand customer desires and build new business models, but also create a flexible infrastructure that can support any business development initiatives.  Equally important is the reliable protection of information and processes from ever-growing and increasingly sophisticated threats. <br><br> <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/hpe/blog/25783/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/56a/165/a0f/56a165a0f097838cf114cde519e1b455.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But it would be a huge mistake, immersed in solving the technological problems of digital transformation, to forget about its main driving force - about employees and customers of companies.  The way your specialists work today and how customers interact with you to a great extent determines the ability of an enterprise to become a real player in the digital market and succeed in the digital economy. <br><br>  For most of us, convenient and quick access to the right information or service has become an integral part of everyday life.  Do not be late for a meeting if the car broke down, ordering a taxi in Uber or another similar application on a smartphone will help.  You can buy the book you are interested in, without spending time on transport, through the online store.  It is possible to analyze the current situation in the industry and prepare for an important meeting even on the way to work - just open the business newspaper's mobile application.

      People expect the same convenience in obtaining information, analyzing and processing it from systems in their workplace.  The necessary data here and now, an interface that is understandable without a long study of instructions, access to relevant information in the office, during a visit to a client or on a business trip are all integral characteristics of the company's working environment, which seeks to make the transition to digital business.  Without such opportunities, it is impossible to ensure high productivity of each employee and the entire professional team necessary for successful digital transformation. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">Flexible and fast</font> </h2><br>  A user-friendly interface, adaptability of the application to the changing needs of the user, quick correction of the situation in the event of a failure, and ideally anticipating such failures - this is a guarantee of productivity, whether we are talking about company employees or consumers of the services it provides. <br><br>  It would seem simple conditions, but to fulfill them is not so simple.  After all, behind each application or service are complex information systems that are integrated both among themselves and with external solutions.  Implementing and controlling changes to such an IT landscape is usually highly formalized, and within these processes it is almost impossible to provide support for flexible user solutions that meet the needs of the digital business.  If your complaint about the low speed of access to the analytical system is put in a long line of requests for changes and a new release will have to wait more than one month, there is no need to speak about any successful digital transformation. <br><br>  HPE sees the solution to the problem in the transition to a flexible (agile) style of work in the process of creating and operating IT services.  Many organizations have already adopted the agile-method, allowing not only to quickly produce new services, but also to constantly improve them, promptly taking into account changes in customer requirements.  However, the advantages of agile-development are leveled, if they are not supported by equally flexible testing processes and rapid transfer of changes to the production environment.  Therefore, today, more and more attention is attracted by the methods of integration of the development, testing and operating divisions - DevOps, of which HPE is an active promoter. <br><br>  The HPE ALM application lifecycle management suite includes everything you need to create and improve an IT service, from defining requirements to comprehensive testing in accordance with agile methods.  HPE Portfolio tools for rapid deployment of test environments and the integration of various life cycle stages, including system operation, enable you to implement end-to-end DevOps processes, and HPE consulting helps customers successfully implement DevOps methods and shape the appropriate corporate culture. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">Quality for productivity</font> </h2><br>  A modern employee needs ergonomic, functional and fast interfaces that allow working with corporate systems in any place and in the most convenient mode.  The HPE Software suite of solutions helps build such interfaces by providing a variety of options for evaluating the performance of both front-end applications and the underlying infrastructure. <br><br>  Check the speed of the system response to requests, evaluate its performance in case of peak load, analyze the interface convenience for various mobile platforms - all this can be done by HPE solutions that are responsible for functional and load testing.  And test management tools make it possible to incorporate these functions into a single application creation process, ensuring error detection and non-optimal product operation at the earliest stages of its life cycle. <br><br>  An equally important component of the quality of a solution that greatly affects the productivity of a user‚Äôs work is safety.  The mobile application of the bank is obliged to ensure the protection of transactions in order to prevent the loss of the client‚Äôs money when he withdraws or transfers his funds.  In the same way, the interface of the corporate system must be reliably protected from all sorts of threats, so that an employee can be sure that important business data is safe if he accesses them remotely.  HPE offers solutions that allow us to create application code that is resistant to vulnerabilities even at the design stage. <br><br>  In addition, we must remember that the productivity of users needs constant support.  The basis of modern applications used for everyday tasks are complex information systems, which more and more often include not only internal corporate solutions, but also external, including cloud services.  At the same time, the effectiveness of the work of an individual employee directly depends on how stable and reliably each component of this hybrid landscape functions.  A modern IT department should carefully consider the corporate architecture, be able to control all the changes occurring in it and analyze their impact not only on individual components of the infrastructure, but also on the operation of applications as a whole. <br><br>  For many years, HPE has been a trendsetter in the IT management solutions market.  Today, in its portfolio of products and services you can find everything you need for proactive monitoring of your IT environment, preventing problems and restoring productive work as quickly as possible in case of failures. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">***</font> </h2><br>  In a digital business, the productivity of each participant in a business process is determined by the quality of IT services.  HPE solutions help you to put together an impeccable multidimensional puzzle of this quality, including a clear and functional interface of the application, a powerful and reliable back-end based on a well-thought-out architecture, infrastructure for continuous improvement of services and tools to support them, and not lose a single element. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300360/</a></p>
