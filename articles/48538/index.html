  <section class="page js-page"><h1>List of likely new features in SharePoint v14 / 2009 (?)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For the past year, Microsoft guerrillafully kept silent about the next version of SharePoint.  At least, no one dared to tell all about the future plans for this technology.  This, as one would expect, led to a lot of rumors, assumptions and other unverified information about this. <br><br>  Recently, I came across <a href="http://edinkapic.blogspot.com/2008/10/sharepoint-v14-2009-feature-list.html">Edin Kopik's post</a> (Edin Kapic), in which he gathered all this fragmented information and compiled a table of the most likely new features of the next version of SharePoint.  The table seemed to me very interesting, and I tried to translate it whenever possible and add a little with my comments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><table border="1" cellpadding="2" width="499"><tbody><tr><td width="101">  <strong>Opportunity</strong> </td><td width="164">  <strong>Description</strong> </td><td width="91">  <strong>Probability</strong> </td><td width="141">  <strong>A source of information</strong> </td></tr><tr><td width="101" align="left">  64-bit version only </td><td width="163" align="left">  SharePoint v14 / 2009 will be released only for x64-architecture and accordingly only for 64-bit OS </td><td width="93">  <strong>Confirmed</strong> </td><td width="140" align="left">  <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262529.aspx">TechNet</a> <br>  (White paper: Office SharePoint Server Service Pack 1) </td></tr><tr><td width="101" align="left">  Silverlight </td><td width="162" align="left">  There will be web parts for Silverlight 2.0 or even a UI based on it. </td><td width="95">  <strong>Most likely</strong> </td><td width="139" align="left">  Assumption </td></tr><tr><td width="102">  Super Lists </td><td width="161" align="left">  Lists are likely to be more closely related to SQL tables. </td><td width="96">  <strong>Probably</strong> </td><td width="138" align="left">  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2008/03-03SharePoint2008.mspx">Bill Gates</a> <br>  (Q &amp; A session after his speech at SharePoint Conference 2008) </td></tr><tr><td width="102" align="left">  Groove integration </td><td width="161" align="left">  If the user has a Groove client installed, more data synchronization options will be available. </td><td width="97">  <strong>Probably</strong> </td><td width="138" align="left">  <a href="http://www.crn.com/software/207401117">Ray ozzie</a> <br>  (Microsoft MVP Seattle Summit April 14-17, 2008) </td></tr><tr><td width="102" align="left">  Master Data Management </td><td width="160" align="left">  Master data can be placed on SQL Server or on SharePoint lists.

      <br>
      Let's analyze this information point by point, so: <br><br>  1. <strong>64-bit only</strong> <br><br>  The only ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù that has some kind of official source: White Paper to the first MOSS 2007 service pack, in the last paragraph of which literally says: <br><blockquote>  Windows SharePoint Server 3.0 and Office SharePoint Server 2007 </blockquote><br>  However, as is usually the case in white papers, the following text on the next page goes: <br><blockquote>  This is a list of information that has been discussed.  It‚Äôs not necessary to express any feedback. </blockquote><br>  So the official document here does not prove anything, and MS may well change its plans in accordance with the market situation. <br><br>  The financial crisis, by the way, may affect plans to upgrade expensive equipment in many organizations.  Therefore, companies that would like to switch to x64 servers may not do this to release a new version of SharePoint.  Therefore, the current situation is still in favor of the x86 version, but these are just my thoughts :) <br><br>  2. <strong>Silverlight web parts or UI</strong> <br><br>  Well, this functionality suggests itself.  And as I used to think, everything is likely to be limited to special web parts for hosting Silverlight.  But in the comments to Edin's post, someone Leon Zandman voiced the information he received from some Microsoft project manager that <a href="http://www.wirwar.com/blog/2008/12/14/sharepoint-2009-comes-with-ribbon-interface/">the SharePoint interface would be built on Ribbon</a> , i.e.  of those very ‚Äútapes‚Äù from Office 2007. And it seems to me that it is easier and better to implement them on Silverlight.  Those.  it seems that Silverlight will be, but how much and in what place is the question.  Therefore, this moment remains mostly a mystery. <br><br>  3. <strong>Super Lists</strong> <br><br>  One of the most interesting features, of which so far is least known.  Admittedly, Bill can intrigue with his questions :).  "SharePoint has always been built on SQL, but that‚Äôs what it is bringing down in."  At the same time, such ‚Äúsuper lists‚Äù, as they should be, are not a substitute, but in addition to regular lists.  Super lists can be added to handle a large amount of information, relationality, and possibly to ensure the operation of SQL queries in them.  Also, the introduction of such types of lists may be associated with another possible new feature - MDM. <br><br>  4. <strong>Integration with Groove</strong> <br><blockquote>  Microsoft Office SharePoint Server and Groove go together like peanut butter and chocolate </blockquote><br>  There is already better than Ray Ozzy can not say :) <br><br>  5. <strong>Master Data Management</strong> <br><br>  The topic of ‚Äúmaster data‚Äù and their management systems is quite extensive and is now very relevant, so MS apparently also seeks to enter this market by <a href="http://www.compulenta.ru/news/321481/">purchasing in 2007 the office ‚ÄúStratature‚Äù</a> , which specializes in this business.  Now what is happening with this product inside MS is hidden under the codename "Bulldog", as has been said.  Therefore, the appearance of such functionality in the new MOSS can be considered almost a fact :). <br>  In addition to this, there is a page <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/mdm/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/mdm/</a> from which you can download ‚Äú <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/6/2/462b1624-2ac4-4ebd-b4c0-7eaef3e4466d/MSMDMRoadmap.pdf">The Microsoft MDM Roadmap</a> ‚Äù in which it is directly written that ‚ÄúBulldog‚Äù will be installed as part of MOSS. <br>  By the way, on the topic of master data, I recommend the article <a href="http://www.osp.ru/os/2007/05/4260254/">‚ÄúThe Tasks of Master Data Management‚Äù Leonid Chernyak, the magazine ‚ÄúOpen Systems‚Äù No. 5 of 06/29/2007</a> . <br><br>  6. <strong>XHTML-compatible output</strong> <br><br>  To be honest, it is not clear where Edin took this information and gave her the status of ‚ÄúPROBABLY‚Äù.  I would put the maximum "MAY BE" <br><br>  7. <strong>FAST Integration</strong> <br><br>  But this functionality has recently been demonstrated at PDC 2008, so the introduction of these web parts into SharePoint is a logical decision to me.  (Here I would put just ‚ÄúPROBABLY‚Äù :)) <br><br>  8. <strong>Support ODF and PDF</strong> <br><br>  Judging by the information from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx">source</a> , this support will be provided in the second service pack for Office 2007 (+ XPS).  It is also modestly stated that the company, i.e.  MS plans to provide this support in a future office version of the codename "Office 14".  True, nothing about Sharepoint says there, but let's hope for the best :) <br><br>  9. <strong>CMIS</strong> <br><br>  Three companies - EMC, IBM and Microsoft - got together somehow and decided to think three of them: ‚ÄúWhy do they say Alfresco, Oracle and SAP speak the same language among themselves, and we all stand aside and cannot communicate with them;  Avilon tower some kind of work, but not Interpret 2.0 ".  So they decided: they signed a document on cooperation and joint support of services for joint management of the contents of their systems.  It is high time :) <br><br>  10. <strong>Claims-based Authentication</strong> <br><br>  Could not find a translation for this term.  But the thing is great.  In short, now SharePoint will not be so strongly tied to Windows-based authentication or forms-based (standard ASP.NET membership provider).  You can use Active Directory, LDAPv3, as well as LiveID, OpenID, CardSpace, Novell's Digital Me, as well as write your own provider.  Helpful :) <br><br>  Actually, for now this is all that is known about the future version of the SharePoint technology.  In this, 2009, MS is obliged to lift the veil of secrecy and give more official interesting information on future versions of popular products.  I think even public alpha and beta versions for testing should appear.  Well, let's wait - we'll see :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48538/</a></p>
