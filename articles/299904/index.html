After all, only they were with the business from the very beginning, they saw ups and downs, and they know all aspects of their business.  As a result, we try to be aware of all the tasks, jump between them and have no time for dismantling everything in a day. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  At the same time, any person who has experience when parents tried to control them (they climbed with and without advice), the husband, wife, or manager trying to get the task done as he is comfortable with, understands how much they can annoy intrusive control.  According to some polls, more than 68% of employees reported that because of such micromanagement, their motivation and morale decreased.  Frankly, I am surprised that this number is not higher.

      When a manager engages in every action and decision, employees never feel satisfied with the task or project implementation.  In addition to psychological problems, specialists in companies with active micromanagement do not get an opportunity to develop their skills, their growth is often limited and very slow. <br><br>  We in the company ‚ÄúGorodor‚Äù managed to achieve effective and well-coordinated work of employees, and now I want to share with you the main points that can help a novice businessman. <br><br>  How to manage employees effectively, but at the same time not to stand above the soul of everyone? <br><br>  <b>1. Hire the right people.</b> <br><br>  This is the most important, obvious and simple rule.  Hire people you can trust and cultivate a culture of responsibility in your business. <br>  When applying for a job, choose not just smart and hardworking candidates.  And also those who are able to learn, find the information he needs, and solve problems on their own. <br><br>  <b>2. Clearly state goals</b> <br><br>  Clearly state the goals that employees must come to in their work.  Do not forget that how well you formulate the task will determine its implementation. <br>  If earlier you constantly interfered in the work of specialists, make sure that now they understand that they must try to solve small tasks on their own, communicate with each other, achieving the goal to be true and on time. <br><br>  <b>3. Use technology</b> <br><br>  On the one hand, you should not stand behind the employee and constantly ask him questions about the progress of the tasks.  On the other hand, managers should be aware of what is happening in order to come to the rescue in time. <br>  To solve this problem, within the framework of our project ‚ÄúCity Portal Networks Gorodor‚Äù, we developed and introduced two tools: one - Timeline - to monitor the work of the technical department, the second - crm for the sales department.  We have developed our own technical tools in order not to customize the already established business processes under existing project management systems and clients. <br><br>  <b>4. Your presence is important</b> <br><br>  Effective delegation does not mean that you are now free from all tasks and can relax, ignoring possible problems for your employees. <br><br>  You simply change your role and go more into strategic support and, if necessary, provide help and assistance.  I also recommend holding regular meetings of experts, during which you can see the progress in the tasks and evaluate the joint work of employees on solutions, if necessary. <br><br>  <b>5. Remuneration</b> <br><br>  On the one hand, you want your employees to take responsibility and be proactive in business matters.  But on the other hand, you need to make sure that your corporate culture recognizes and rewards the right patterns of behavior.  Employee initiative and responsibility must be rewarded.  This could be, for example, a freer schedule, an extra day of rest, a dinner for two, corporate events, a cash bonus - everything that makes sense for your company.  Even just a heartfelt thanks from the management or recognition in front of the whole team can motivate you to develop further. <br><br>  <b>6. Think and learn</b> <br><br>  Select a time once a week to think about your employee interactions.  Were there any situations when you really were not needed to fulfill your goal, where you were too deeply involved in the details and did not allow the team to cope on their own?  Were there any cases where you could not interfere?  Consider every situation. <br><br>  Build the work of the whole team, without your constant control - not so easy.  Especially if you are like me and consider your business one of your children.  But if you want your company to grow, you need to have an independent, prosperous, happy and competent team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299904/</a></p>
