      How to correctly pronounce the name of the Texas shoe company Lucchese, ‚ÄúLu-cheese-ee‚Äù or ‚ÄúLu-kay-zee‚Äù? <br><br>  How to correctly pronounce ‚Äúquay‚Äù in the name of Australia's Circular Quay, ‚Äúkway‚Äù or ‚Äúkey‚Äù? <br><br>  In each question, the correct answer is the second option.  When people make the wrong choice, they look ignorant.  We do not want you to look like these on social networks, so read some tips on how to avoid this. </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Do not be empty </h4><br>  According to one of the characters of the cartoon Bambi: <i>"If you can not say something good, do not say anything at all."</i>  This edification is very valuable.  Aggressiveness is ignorant.  Discrediting other points of view is mutilated.  Complaints about the publication of other people frankly stupid.  If you do not like the post, shut up and move on. <br><br><h4>  Do not tell people what to share </h4><br>  Telling people what to share is not just a sign of ignorance, it‚Äôs just a huge billboard of ignorance.  If you don‚Äôt like what a person shares online, just don‚Äôt follow his notes.  You do not pay for reading, so do not think that you have the right to indicate to anyone.  The sun does not revolve around the earth, and the Internet does not revolve around you. <br><br><h4>  Do not buy followers, likes or pros </h4><br>  Only losers and charlatans buy followers, likes or pros.  I do not deny that people often think that a large number of subscribers prove some valuable properties, but buying subscribers is nothing but a scam.  This is how large companies are slipping down the "slippery slope." <br><br>  The CEO, having visited the conference or reading <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/">Fast Company</a> , decides that the company should make more use of social media.  Tells the marketing director about this, explaining that he wants to see concrete results, expressed in an increase in the number of subscribers, likes and benefits.  Here, the chief marketing officer realizes that the company does not have a single specialist who understands social media and makes a seemingly logical choice.  Hires someone from an advertising agency.  After that, a budget is requested, sufficient to purchase the required number of subscribers and votes.  The office spends money, and about a miracle, the necessary tsiferki appear in the right places.  Everyone is happy. <br><br>  Meanwhile, since the purchased tsiferki have nothing to do with reality, SMO can not deliver meaningful results.  Acquired numbers do not provide long-term benefits, as they do not interact with your content and have no interest in your publications.  You can never get caught buying social gadgets, but what you do will ruin your karma, and karma is an unreliable friend (original <i>is a bitch</i> ). <br><br>  There is one exception - this is the purchase of promoting publications or pages on Facebook, but this is practically the same thing as advertising in any other places. <br><br><h4>  Do not ask people to follow you </h4><br>  If you want more followers, earn them the quality of your publications.  If Groucho Marx (Groucho Marx) were alive today, he would change his famous joke and say, <i>"that people who ask you to follow them are not worth it</i> . <i>"</i>  Preserve dignity, do not kite and share useful things in large quantities. <br><br>  Do not bother people by asking you to follow you and at the same time add social links to your blog.  Social links are already a subtle invitation to follow you. <br><br><h4>  Do not ask people to retype your messages. </h4><br>  If your messages are good, it will happen naturally.  If you use all the methods described above, people will read your publications anyway.  If they are good, people will reprint them.  Everything is very simple.  The only time when requests for reprinting are acceptable is when a post is of a charitable nature. <br><br><h4>  Do not announce that you have unsubscribed from someone </h4><br>  No one cares, and it seems like a situation where you are standing in the middle of the school cafeteria and suddenly announce that you are no longer a friend. <br><br>  Few people will follow your example, and will only sign off because you did it. <br><br><h4>  Don't ask why people unsubscribe from you. </h4><br>  Changing the list of subscribers is a continuous process, so do not panic when people unsubscribe from you.  If you start asking about it, you can lose even more subscribers.  Instead, continue further activities, comment and answer questions, and do not worry about those who left. <br><br><h4>  Don't be a pimp </h4><br>  Social media is a great way to promote your product, service or website, which is why we are talking about this.  You will look very stupid if more than one of the twenty publications will be advertising.  Imagine if on the radio a single advertisement was played all day. <br><br><h4>  Do not swear </h4><br>  Foul language is bullshit.  Someone might think that swearing on social networks can be a sign of openness, sincerity and authenticity.  That's bullshit.  Profanity is a sign of inert language, if not ignorance, so the use of foul language should be approached with extreme caution. <br><br><h4>  Do not call yourself a guru or expert </h4><br>  If you are a guru or an expert, people will know it.  If not, no one will believe you.  In particular, ‚Äúsocial media gurus‚Äù is an oxymoron, because no one knows how social media really works! <br><br>  No matter how smart you are, to advance in social media you have to continue to experiment, because the platforms are in constant change.  In addition, we noticed that self-proclaimed experts, who think they know everything, understand the subject worse than everyone else. <br><br><h4>  Discard agencies </h4><br>  If you hire an agency that sends a dozen people to measure sentiment to your brand, then forty-five days makes up the right tweet, this book is not for you. <br><br>  Refuse the services of "experts" who have hundreds of subscribers, writing once a month, and asking for more than the GDP of some small country.  A good rule of thumb is to never follow the advice of someone who has fewer followers than you do. <br><br>  If you follow the tips described, you will not need any agency.  If you follow the advice described and you work in such an agency, you may now be able to justify your fees. <br><br><h4>  Do not delegate social media promotion to an intern </h4><br>  Just because you‚Äôve found a young man who uses Facebook and agrees to work for less money than a fast food employee doesn‚Äôt mean you have to hire him.  It is the same as believing that having a car makes a person a mechanic. <br><br>  Don't get us wrong, we like the interns.  We just want to make sure that you take social media seriously.  At the very least, require interns to monitor every post and comment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286096/</a></p>
