  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Call center for a small company: Symbiosis amoCRM and Hive</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <i>Any client will confirm that the Call Center is cool: it's nice when you immediately pick up the phone when you call, it's good if you can enter the "internal number of the subscriber" and talk to your manager, and it is very nice when they recognize you by their phone number.</i>  <i>And today we will tell you how an affordable call center works based on two simple cloud solutions - amoCRM and Hive.</i> </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6c/52b/8f2/e6c52b8f24524b678d3914a6186b30cc.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In any company, the Call Center solves two important tasks: handling incoming calls and processing outgoing calls.  For each of them, you need, firstly, to get a reliable and convenient telephony system, and secondly, the ability to automate and optimize employee communication with customers.  And the entire call center can be implemented on the basis of the duet Hive and amoCRM. <p></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b5/551/b06/2b5551b0654941fe8140f8411652b805.png"><br><h3>  Heve </h3><br><p>  The first element of the cloud Call Center is the Hive virtual PBX.  You can access IP telephony as a service using one or several incoming numbers.  And since we are considering the question of organizing a call center today, each operator receives his own internal number in Hive, and voice menus are easily and conveniently created for clients - including complex ones with different depths of choice and the ability to switch to a free employee at any time. </p><br><p>  Already on the basis of the virtual Hive PBX, functions such as call recording are available, to which we have devoted a number of past posts, the ability to set up call forwarding and call transfer, key parameters for prioritizing calls and a ready-made reporting section.  You can get statistics of such Call-center parameters as average waiting time on a line, number of missed calls, and so on. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0d/e38/094/a0de380943214c04b668b614e6d4cea0.png"><br><p>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>Call statistics in Hive</i> </p><br><h3>  amoCRM </h3><br><p>  But a virtual PBX would remain a virtual PBX and only if it were not for deep integration with amoCRM.  This system for automating interaction with customers is also provided from the cloud service and even on the mobile, so your call center employees can work from a smartphone or laptop and, accordingly, be out of office at all. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d72/412/3de/d724123dea4b48c0b8b0a2314d6d1c87.png"><br><p>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>Client card in amoCRM</i> </p><br><p>  In the CRM system, a card is set up for each client, the system leads it and helps operators to respond to calls correctly and call themselves back, for example, if the customer did not wait on the line or the connection was interrupted.  The CRM-system can be set the basic rules and key indicators, you can program the policy of communication with customers, and also available analytics - sales funnel, the achievement of goals, and so on. </p><br><h3>  Synergy </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/792/579/f6a/792579f6a5624afc971bbb960e6065b0.jpg"><br><p>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>Call center operation based on amoCRM and Hive</i> </p><br><p>  But all this has long been known - the difference between the various solutions is only in the details.  However, together these two products provide an interesting synergistic effect.  Firstly, when processing a call (no matter whether it is incoming or outgoing), the manager sees a client card in amoCRM in front of him.  It is activated and displayed automatically, contains all the useful information about the interaction with the client.  In particular, due to the integration of amoCRM and Hive, every conversation is recorded in the card, all records (which we store in Hive indefinitely and in unlimited volume) are available by pressing the * button. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce0/48c/498/ce048c498de94813af85421a8919d811.png"><br><p>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>Client card with the event of a missed call</i> </p><br><p>  Secondly, you can make a call from the client's card by clicking.  That is, the operator's IP phone will be connected to the client if the first one has pressed the ‚Äúcall‚Äù button in the CRM system.  This is very useful when working with the implementation of the plans in CRM - it may be that for some customers need to call for reminders of intentions, and others just need to call back, because they were not accepted call. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5dc/082/d71/5dc082d717334e029bb6b4dd88d31b97.png"><br><p>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>Calling a client directly from a CRM system</i> </p><br><p>  The essence of the integrated solution is that we have implemented the operator‚Äôs workplace in amoCRM, and all telephone and communication functions are available from there.  A call center employee should have only a computer and internet access - this is enough for full and automated work. </p><br><p>  Moreover, at the level of a virtual PBX, Hive has a supervisor panel - a distinctive feature of the solution for a small Call Center.  The head of the department can use to manage call queues, monitor the quality of the operators, add or remove Call Center employees from the queue of processed calls, or switch them to VIP clients.  On the panel of the supervisor, all information comes in real time - you can even connect to the conversation to track the quality of work of each operator when communicating with the client. </p><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br><p>  Today we reviewed a real cloud Call Center, which can be created, as they say, ‚Äúin two clicks‚Äù based on the Hive and amoCRM services.  Of course, it is not the best way to equip workplaces in a traditional contact center, but at the same time it will allow small business representatives to quickly and easily interact with customers with minimal cost and time and without purchasing any software.  The already implemented integration of products facilitates the installation and configuration process, so you can try a similar scheme of virtual PBX and cloud CRM right now by simply registering on the Hive and amoCRM portals and ordering test access to system capabilities. </p><br><p>  * The function of recording and storing conversations is available at an additional cost. </p></div>
