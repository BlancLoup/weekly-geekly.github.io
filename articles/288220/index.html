I even remember how an acquaintance showed me a laptop, where the Chinese in a cunning way changed Win98 beyond recognition, making it almost identical to WinXP (for the uninitiated user), replacing all real hardwired data with fake.  As a result, a laptop based on P2 showed characteristics as an advanced P4.  In general, it is possible not only to write books about the Chinese and their products, but also to fill entire libraries with such books.  Of course, there are good products, but still a very large number of Chinese products are based on the developments of other companies, on the software of other companies, it is clear that the latter do not receive any satisfaction as a result of such arrogant copying.  In general, now the Chinese government has gathered to forget about the country's dark IT past and to start a large-scale fight with pirates and pirated goods. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Again, how can you not remember the fake Chinese eggs, photos of the cooking procedure of which appeared quite a while ago on many popular resources (fishnet, aha).  And so, the Chinese government is going to put an end to all this.  China‚Äôs prime minister, Wen Jiabao, said this week that the government is going to put an end to the import and export of pirated software, DVDs, books and other goods that violate copyright and various patents.  It seems that the government of the Celestial Empire wants to whitewash their country and start everything from a white sheet (but with foreign technologies that are already ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù for many years, which no one will take back)?

      The anti-piracy campaign begins at the end of October, and lasts for half a year, after which, as the Chinese government hopes, pirated products will be noticeably less.  The news agencies of this country unanimously say that "the perpetrators will be subjected to serious punishment."  So the campaign seems to be really big.  By the way, the Chinese are now ordered to work only with licensed software. <br><br>  It is possible, of course, that China has simply begun to make concessions to the US government, which has long announced that if China does not stop violating copyright law, then the country will be subject to the most serious economic sanctions - and this is not a good prospect for developing countries. so stormy countries.  Of course, there is an option that China will conduct a couple of indicative and exemplary operations, and everything will remain the same, but somehow the Chinese media talk about this a lot. <br><br>  By the way, only the pirated software market is estimated at about $ 7.6 billion for China.  It is terrible to even think how much this country earns on pirated goods in general.  It seems that this is quite a significant part of the budget, with which, it seems, China is ready to give up for relieving itself in the eyes of its near and distant neighbors. <br><br>  Well, did the Chinese phones come to an end?  It seems to me hardly. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20020138-93.html">CNET</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288220/</a></p>
