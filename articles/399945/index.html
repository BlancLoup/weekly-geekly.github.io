  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The rise and fall of home-made ideas</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The company MakerBot made a bold bid that 3D printers will become as popular as microwaves.  There is only one problem: all the others did not share her enthusiasm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/722/23a/f8c/72223af8cb6db5fca153844a22026ec7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In October 2009, Bre Pettis, with his unique sideburns and dark-framed rectangular glasses, took his place on the stage of <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ignite-nyc-open-hack-yahoo-open-hack-day-tickets-443332018">Ignite NYC</a> , threw up his hands and shouted ‚ÄúHurray!‚Äù Twice.  Behind him, a PowerPoint slide came on, with a photograph of a hollow wooden box with wires.  Bouncing around so that his rich head of graying hair went up and down, Petis began: "I will talk about MakerBot, and the future, and the industrial revolution that we are starting - which has already begun." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Petis, a former art teacher, became a key character in the growing market in the late 2000s, the global community of hobbyists doing their own hands at workshops, workshops and hackerspaces, as well as at home, and working with classical lathes and modern laser cutters.  Petis began his ascent in 2006, recording weekly videos for MAKE magazine ‚Äî self-made bibles ‚Äî during which he performed such foolish tasks as connecting light bulbs to a hamster wheel feed.  In 2008, he co-founded the NYC Resistor hackerspace in Brooklyn.  By the time he was already a star.  A year later, he launched a startup with friends Adam Mayer [Adam Mayer] and Zach Smith [Zach Smith] called MakerBot.

      ‚ÄúWe had a unit that produces three-dimensional objects, and it was awesome,‚Äù said Petis from the scene of Ignite NYC.  Grabbing technology from the size of large machines worth $ 100,000 to desktop boxes, MakerBot launched a revolution in 3D printing.  With the help of a 3D printer, objects developed on a computer were physically formed in three dimensions by overlaying the layers of molten plastic on each other.  And now any MakerBot owner could design and print his objects. <br><br>  From the point of view of Petis, the consequences of this were amazing.  People printing objects at home could go to the store less often and do whatever they want.  He shared a story about ‚Äúprinted happiness‚Äù: a certain person needed a ring to make an offer, and he printed it out.  For five and a half minutes, Petis praised what he said was the ‚ÄúIndustrial Revolution 2,‚Äù which MakerBot led. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou will be a producer for yourself,‚Äù he said.  And he completed his presentation by asking the listeners to "make their own future." <br><br>  A year before MakerBot was founded, analysts predicted that the global market for 3D printers, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/14299512">with a volume of about $ 1.2 billion</a> , would double by 2015.  By the end of 2012, he almost grew up.  MakerBot seemed to be on time: that year the company released its most famous and probably the best device, the Replicator 2. MakerBot predicted that the device would appear in thousands of houses.  Wires in October 2012 announced that his release was a ‚ÄúMacintosh moment‚Äù for MakerBot, and on the cover there was a self-confident Petiz holding his new child and the words ‚ÄúThis car will change the world‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/163/c2d/032/163c2d032a07bb03f72f8afa71a8fd13.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúMakerBot is, or at least was similar to, the Kleenex brand for the world of 3D printing.  MakerBot has become a synonym for a 3D printer, ‚Äùsaid Matt Stultz, who had worked for the company for five months and is now working as a digital publishing editor at MAKE. <br><br>  Petis has become a cult character.  Even before the launch of the company, according to Stalts, "we already watched everything he does, watched the weekly videos and watched his projects."  With the release of MakerBot, he became the king of hackers. <br><br>  But the second industrial revolution, and the times when every-self-maker, armed with new ideas and loyal MakerBot, never came.  By 2015, Petis, Meier, and Smith were engaged in other projects.  A new director and a team came to the company, and three waves of layoffs reduced the initial number of employees to <a href="http://investors.stratasys.com/releasedetail.cfm%3FReleaseID%3D898028">600</a> people by almost half.  This year, the <a href="http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160104-global-3d-printer-market-jumps-in-2015-thanks-to-desktop-3d-printer-sales.html">device</a> from a Taiwanese manufacturer has <a href="http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160104-global-3d-printer-market-jumps-in-2015-thanks-to-desktop-3d-printer-sales.html">become the</a> most popular desktop 3D printer. <br><br>  How did MakerBot, the darling of the 3D industry, fall so low and so fast?  Petis does not respond to requests for comment, and Smith and Meier declined to be interviewed for this article. <br><br>  We gathered information from various industry observers, today's MakerBot management, and a dozen former employees of the company.  Some introduced themselves, others wanted to remain anonymous. <br><br>  Over the years, MakerBot needed to make two successful moves.  It was necessary to show the wonders of 3D printing to millions of people, and then convince them to pay more than $ 1000 per machine.  She also needed to develop a technology that was fast enough for customers to be satisfied.  And these tasks were beyond the power of the young company. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMakerBot made major commitments and tried to satisfy market demand, which never appeared,‚Äù says Ben Rokhold, who worked as an engineer for four years at MakerBot.  In search of a dream about how everyone would become a manufacturer, MakerBot tried to produce printers that were both inexpensive and attractive, but they didn‚Äôt succeed. <br><br>  At the TEDx conference in New York in 2012, Petis said, ‚ÄúWhen you have a MakerBot, you have superpower.  You can do everything you need. ‚Äù <br><br>  Years have passed since then, before someone decided to say that this is not true. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  At the very beginning of the way, the community, rallied around these printers with an affordable architecture, thrived on the MakerBot base. <br><br>  The inspiration came from the British professor Adrian Bowyer, who began working on RepRap, a desktop 3D printer in 2005, using layer-by-layer fusion modeling to print objects.  Bower wanted to create a printer that could print a copy of himself.  One RepRap would spawn another, printing parts, and so on.  In New York, three friends, upon learning of this, came up with their own idea.  Can they make a machine that prints the parts needed to assemble a RepRap?  And the answer was positive.  Working at NYC Resistor, Zack Smith, Adam Meyer and Bra Petis created CupCake CNC, a machine that could print parts for RepRap on request. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/17e/7b2/0ab/17e7b20abc45128bfb40f795ccae4002.jpg"><br>  <i>Spare parts for the assembly of MakerBot</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe idea was to make a small number of such printers, thanks to which people can make their own RepRap, and the first batch sold very quickly,‚Äù said Stalz, who worked at MakerBot from December 2011 to April 2012. <br><br>  In January 2009, the trio founded the company MakerBot, receiving an investment of $ 75,000, of which $ 25,000 was invested by Bower and his wife, Christina.  The company had to sell CupCake as a set for self-assembly.  By spring, the company sold CupCake kits for $ 750 apiece.  ‚ÄúWe drove out through the MAKE magazine, we were noticed by the media who loved the idea and kept talking about it all the time,‚Äù says Rokhold. <br><br>  CupCake was also an open project.  MakerBot released hardware and software to operate the device for free, and those who bought CupCakes made their corrections and additions, which the company included in the next version of printers.  The open project gathered people from inside the company and from the outside, and they were all looking for improvements.  It also served as a good advertisement, and became the basis and attractive side of MakerBot. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOpenness is the future of production, and we are at the beginning of a sharing era,‚Äù <a href="http://makezine.com/2011/10/06/makes-exclusive-interview-with-bre-pettis-of-makerbot-life-10m-in-funding-and-beyond/">said Petis in an interview</a> with MAKE magazine in 2011.  ‚ÄúIn the future, people will remember enterprises that did not want to share with their customers, and wonder how they could work the other way around.‚Äù <br><br>  MakerBot personified the revolution in the production of things.  One CupCake could create <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3285">almost exact copies of itself</a> (with the exception of bolts and other metal parts), as well as copies of countless other objects.  This movement was to be transformed from a geek subculture into a transforming force changing society. <br><br>  The demand for CupCakes was so great that the owners of these devices even helped MakerBot print out the details for sending out new kits.  On Google Groups and Reddit, active forums thrived, fans shared their design of objects on Thingiverse, the site launched by the company and stored files under a Creative Commons license. <br><br>  Some fans themselves made corrections to CupCakes.  Christopher Jansen, a user named <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/ScribbleJ/designs/page:1">ScribbleJ</a> on Thingiverse, figured out how to reduce car noise and improve print quality.  Another user, Whosawhatsis ?, has developed a more efficient extruder, a component that extrudes molten plastic. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBecause our project is open source, users know that they have the right to hack code and design,‚Äù <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/364-shapeways-interviews-bre-pettis-of-makerbot-industries.html">said Petis</a> in an interview in early 2010.  "They also know that if they improve the car, they will be able to share this improvement with others, and everyone will benefit from it." <br><br>  MakerBot's corporate culture was also open and flexible.  The first office in Brooklyn was more like an experimental lab.  The staff came late and left late.  One day you could pack CupCake kits, next day you could test extruders.  Petis answered support questions, dropped in to the MakerBot Operators Google Group for comments, and sometimes helped employees figure out the difficulties of iron by encouraging activities that they would have been fired for in a more rigorous company.  On one of his first working days, Ethan Hartman wondered if the PLA, the plastic used to create the 3D objects, would catch fire if it stuck to the extruder.  He recalls that Petis grabbed the burner, a piece of plastic, and they took turns trying to light it on the floor. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNobody worked there to work out the necessary time and earn a lot of money on the sale,‚Äù says Hartman, who worked in the support service, and then as a company manager from April 2010 to August 2012. ‚ÄúPeople worked there because they liked the idea that open iron can be part of a commercial enterprise. ‚Äù <br><br>  The company has a lot that was allowed.  Interested passers-by were not forbidden to enter without warning and see what was happening.  ‚ÄúIn the earliest days there was no clear operating structure.  We did not think we could support the project when it began to grow, and there was no expectation that the company would ever grow very much, ‚Äùsaid Matt Griffin, public relations manager at MakerBot from December 2009 to August 2012. <br><br>  Employees believed that this was a dream job, and a chance to turn an alternative future into reality - into a world where everyone can become a manufacturer.  Hartman says that the fact that MakerBot was an open source company was the most important reason people loved working at it.  They even agreed to lower salaries.  One person recalls that his salary at MakerBot was $ 22,000 less than at the previous place of work.  But work in the company excited.  They had to turn the market on their own rules. <br><br>  In September 2010, MakerBot began selling Thing-O-Matic, their second 3D printer, as a set for $ 1225 (or $ 2500 for the assembled version).  By that time, many had already used CupCakes to create various things, such as a <a href="http://kk.org/cooltools/makerbot-cupcak/">device for winding headphones in the form of an owl</a> or three-dimensional puzzles.  Thing-O-Matic raised the stakes.  <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/education/article/Students-make-computer-design-3-D-reality-2419119.php">In the Texas school,</a> with its help, chess pieces were made that resembled the sights of San Antonio, and then sold them for $ 150.  Petis appeared in The Colbert Report and printed on Thing-O-Matic a bust of Stephen Colbert, which can still be <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9104/">downloaded from Thingiverse</a> .  The magazine MAKE <a href="http://makezine.com/2011/06/09/makerbot-prints-stephens-head-on-the-colbert-report/">compared the</a> appearance of Petis with the ‚Äúfive-minute informational and commercial‚Äù and was noisily glad - they say, ‚Äúwho among the viewers will not want to buy the same for themselves?‚Äù. <br><br>  In the following years, more serious ideas, such as a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/02/robohand-how-cheap-3d-printers-built-a-replacement-hand-for-a-five-year-old-boy/">prosthetic arm</a> printed on a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/02/robohand-how-cheap-3d-printers-built-a-replacement-hand-for-a-five-year-old-boy/">3D printer,</a> replaced the trinkets.  It seemed that the vision of Petis, described by him in 2009, is being realized.  People printed the objects they needed.  "At first, the common theme was that 'We want to change the world.'  Democratization of production - we used this phrase both in the company and outside it, ‚Äùsays a former employee of the company's web team who worked there since September 2010. <br><br>  The company supported this spirit.  MakerBot was the place where everyone went to meetings, and the staff had a bot at the end of their formal position.  Andrew Pelkey ‚Äã‚Äãwas hired in the second week of March 2012 for writing posts in blogs, copywriting and control over posts on the social network.  But he says he was not a writer, but a ‚Äúbot‚Äù writer (WriterBot). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54e/f26/22e/54ef2622e2a22bef986987cab21022c7.jpg"><br>  <i>The then editor-in-chief of The Wire, Chris Anderson and Bra Petis, 2010, New York</i> <br><br>  In classic startups, this attitude prevails: quickly make mistakes, look for solutions, repeat, quickly create, release a product.  Petis called it the " <a href="https://medium.com/%40bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13">cult of accomplished deeds,</a> " and listed the principles on his blog.  One of them: ‚ÄúThe error is considered a completed case.  Make a mistake. <br><br>  Petis was proficient in creating a community of online followers.  Fans adored him, he was a friendly, admirable man who loved to create something and explore what fans of 3D printers created.  In his speech at Ignite NYC, he showed a photograph of a working whistle, which was developed by a user from Germany, and printed out by a resident of New York.  ‚ÄúWe invented teleportation.  Show me how to get a whistle from Germany to New York without a rocket, ‚Äùhe joked happily.  The audience picked up his laugh. <br><br>  And over time, it was Petis, not Meyer or Smith, who became the public face of the company.  In the 2014 Print The Legend documentary, Print the Legend, Petis recalls a conversation with co-founders when they compared him to another tech geek.  ‚ÄúYou have to be Steve Jobs,‚Äù Petis recalls to the camera, and then says that he himself wanted to be the equivalent of Steve Wozniak. <br><br>  But Petis did a great job at MakerBot as Jobs, and shoppers sorted out Thing-O-Matic and CupCake, which MakerBot sold in 2011 for Father's Day <a href="https://www.makerbot.com/media-center/2011/06/15/announcing-our-455-cupcake-cnc-ultimate-kit-fathers-day-sale">at a special price of $ 455</a> .  ‚ÄúThe typical MakerBot user was a person who recently learned that 3D printers are awesome.  And when they found out that they could be bought for $ 1,000 or less, it completely dizzy, ‚Äùsays Hartman. <br><br>  Now, not only technical journalists wrote about MakerBot.  <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/blogs/gear-up/makerbots-thing-o-matic-3d-printers-turn-ideas-into-reality-20111101">Rolling Stone wrote</a> about Thing-O-Matic.  At CBS Evening News, it was <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/the-rise-of-makerbots/%3FlumiereId%3D50089887%26videoId%3D673e2c16-8bdf-11e2-9400-029118418759%26cbsId%3D6649218%26site%3Dcbsnews">speculated</a> whether the widespread distribution of MakerBots would make it possible for us to create anything.  In The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/06/15/technology/personaltech/20110915-BASICS.html%3F_r%3D1%26src%3Dtp%26">printed schemes</a> Thing-O-Matic. <br><br>  By August 2011, MakerBot had sold 5,200 printers.  That month, he received $ 10 million in investments - from Foundry Group, Bezos Expeditions and others - and began to grow, adding another office in Brooklyn.  By the fall, 70 people worked at MakerBot. <br><br>  The excitement grew, but the early employees felt that change was inevitable.  ‚ÄúCollecting investments is something that excited people.  The attitude has changed to "now we have to show a sharp growth and start expanding the company with great speed," says Hartman. <br><br>  In a post about investments, Petis wrote that investment and active hiring of employees was necessary to ‚Äúdemocratize production and simplify access to 3D printing for everyone!‚Äù. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  The company understood that in order to attract people other than hackers, it needed a simpler ‚Äúplug and play‚Äù type printer.  ‚ÄúThe sets were difficult to assemble.  People needed pre-assembled things that just work, ‚Äùsays Hartman. <br><br>  So MakerBot decided to develop and present at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) its new MMM product - Mass Market MakerBot.  It was planned that the cost of MMM will be comparable to the cost of a game set-top box - and no self-assembly.  Such a device was supposed to appeal to typical Walmart customers and office equipment stores. <br><br>  The company secretly organized the development of MMM, opening its branch in China - ‚Äúa crazy top-secret project,‚Äù as one of its former employees called it.  The head of the development was Zach Smith, an engineering specialist.  He picked up key engineers from Brooklyn and China. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0aa/b73/7b7/0aab737b762ab59153b4b0b18a2e3f36.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  But in September 2011, Petis decided to change the company's course.  He gathered the members of the research and development team, and announced that in three months they should develop, build and test another 3D printer - The Replicator.  ‚ÄúThe Replicator came to life because Bree came to the meeting, grabbed all the developers of Brooklyn and said: we need a printer for CES, but did not say why,‚Äù says Rokhold.  Boxes with versions of MMM periodically arrived in Brooklyn, but ‚Äúthe speed of improving the printer was extremely low,‚Äù says Rokhold. <br><br>  CES was approaching, and Pettis wanted to see the printed objects for inspection: one the size of a loaf of bread, and the other DeLorean from Back to the Future.  Replicator passed the test and became the main company number at CES.  Its retail price was $ 1,749. <br><br>  He did <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/media-center/2012/01/09/introducing-the-makerbot-replicator">not become an</a> inexpensive printer, but he still <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/media-center/2012/01/16/the-makerbot-replicator-wins-best-of-ces-2012-for-emerging-tech">received the</a> Best Emerging Tech award at CES.  He had a certain charm - the printer frame was made of balsa.  And it was sold fully assembled.  The hardware and software were still open, and therefore the community could continue to support the project.  And besides, the fans themselves could fix possible problems, which made Replicator in their eyes a workhorse. <br><br>  A few months later, in April 2012, MakerBot completed all operations in China.  Zach Smith <a href="http://www.hive76.org/hoeken">quit</a> .  ‚ÄúIn no case could MakerBot China be mentioned,‚Äù says one former employee. <br><br>  According to Rockhold, people bought the Replicator in batches.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But he says that the printer had serious problems: the heating platforms burned out, because the cables did not support the required voltage, and the device itself was very sensitive to static. If a user who had accumulated a static charge inserted an SD card with a file for printing, the machine could make a loud sound ‚Äî the sound of destroying the printer, or, at best, the sound of expensive repairs.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By that time, MakerBot was not the only printer - and was in danger due to the fact that the company was unable to produce cheaper printers. A month before CES 2012, web developer Brooke Drumm managed to raise $ 831,000 for Printrbot on Kickstarter, which was sold as a set for assembly and cost only $ 549. The Cube, a glossy plastic desktop printer from 3D Systems, a serious company specializing in industrial 3D printing, also debuted at CES 2012 at a price of $ 1,299. A few months later, Solidoodle, founded by former MakerBot COO Sam Cervantes, </font></font><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/25/2973943/solidoodle-3d-printer-second-generation-sam-cervantes"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">released a new printer</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that does not require assembly, at a price of only $ 499.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b05/7fb/a13/b057fba134061feb88a3e7acda88dc68.gif"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the same year, the analytical company Gartner made an important conclusion. On the ‚ÄúGartner Hype Cycle‚Äù chart (the ‚ÄúGartner hype cycle‚Äù), which tracks emerging technologies that take place at different stages from excessive enthusiasm and getting rid of illusions to sobering realism, 3D printing was placed at the very top of the peak designated as ‚Äúpeak exaggerated expectations. ‚Äù In the attached </font></font><a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2124315"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">report,</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Gartner clarified that 3D printing means home use of printers. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa consumer technology market for ‚Äúindependent producers‚Äù has reached the peak of hype.</font></font><br><br>  * * * <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In May 2012, MakerBot </font></font><a href="http://www.makerbot.com/media-center/2012/05/08/makerbots-new-digs"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">announced</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> the move to the 21st floor of the MetroTech Center business center in Brooklyn. It already employed 125 people, and she was preparing to introduce to the world a new printer, the Replicator 2. ‚ÄúThere are no signs of a slowdown in demand in the near future,‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Petis </font></font><a href="http://www.makerbot.com/media-center/2012/05/08/makerbots-new-digs"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">said at the</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> time. ‚ÄúUntil the moment when MakerBot will meet as often as a microwave, it‚Äôs not long to wait!‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then, in August, TangiBot came out. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2c/cde/06f/a2ccde06fc5aa98477e65ca8a2c7bbda.gif"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At Kickstarter, engineer Matt Strong </font></font><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mattstrong/the-tangibot-3d-printer-the-affordable-makerbot-re"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">collected $ 500,000</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> for the mass production of an exact replicator replicator. "I want to bring an inexpensive device to a market that is trustworthy users," </font></font><a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/08/tangibot-makerbot-clone/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">said</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Strong. "Replicator is the best printer and open source project."</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In other words, Strong simply made his Replicator under a different name. And then he offered to push the TangiBot printers for much less money, thanks to production in China. Thus, according to Strong, he could sell printers for $ 1,199, which is $ 550 less than the Replicator. And technically he could do it - an open project is not protected by copyright law. Therefore, Strong raised funds on Kickstarter to find a contractor and start production. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The community rallied around MakerBot and announced the campaign to create a TangiBot robbery. And although the campaign failed, this experience forced Petis to reconsider his love for open source projects. ‚ÄúReplicator 2 was already ready to leave, and Bree, seeing TangiBot, said, 'No, we‚Äôve finished with this business strategy,'‚Äù says Rohold.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the Replicator 2 came out, the parts of the device were closed. The black metal frame was patented, as was the graphical interface that controlled the printing software on the computer. These changes looked insignificant, but the public suited the company. One former employee said that people were furious. All corrections and improvements that they have made for the project for years, for free, have become closed. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The community was confused by such a move, and an outpouring of emotions hit </font></font><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the company's operators</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in the </font></font><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Google Group</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Some users have shown </font></font><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">cautious sympathy.</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: ‚ÄúI want to hear that he, like everyone else, has endured this decision, and I hope that he will find a way out. Because if he made this 180-degree turn with no emotion, I would lose respect for Bre and MakerBot. But I doubt that this is the case. I hope that this is not - we'll see. " Others were </font></font><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">more specific</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : "There is no reason to hope that a closed project will protect the design from theft or reverse engineering with subsequent resale. A closed project only harms the community." </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI think they really suffered from us, and felt abandoned,‚Äù says Pelky. "Essentially, MakerBot was a club, and people felt like a part of this club."</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Employees are also confused, because the project closure alienated the project from the fans, from the community that readily acquired MakerBot printers. ‚ÄúThey thought they had already made a name for themselves, and the community was no longer needed. But 3D printing today is not yet able to live without a community, ‚Äùsays Stalz. "If you get angry with early lovers of 3D printers, they won't say to everyone, 'Buy MakerBot'." </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The company turned its back on the original idealism that founded it. The Era of Exchange, which Petis referred to a year ago, is over. </font></font><br><br> <a href="https://3dprint.com/14012/makerbot-ceo-bre-pettis/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remembering this two years later</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Petis seemed to hint that he always knew that MakerBot could not exist in the open. ‚ÄúWe could remain open, but it would destroy the business,‚Äù he said in an interview with Politico in August 2014. ‚ÄúSo the question was: what is our mission? Do something absurd, utopian, unrealistic? Or 3D printers for everyone? I chose 3D printers for everyone. ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By releasing a closed product, the company raised the stakes. So far, she has advanced in tandem with dedicated communities that are not very demanding of technical problems. Now, when their printer could not be repaired on their own, and when it had to be suitable for any user, they were required to work perfectly.</font></font><br><br>  * * * <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In June 2013, MakerBot bought Stratasys, one of the largest 3D print companies in the world, for $ 403 million, plus $ 201 in bonuses based on performance. MakerBot began large-scale hiring, and CES 2014 showed three new desktop printers. They had new features like WiFi support, LCD displays and the new Smart Extruder. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bec/3b2/bba/bec3b2bba0a4c957e7ccf715f25f0d38.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the cost was still too high. </font></font><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/makerbot-replicator-mini-review-3-d-printing-comes-home-1403021932"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Mini</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> cost $ 1,375. XYZprinting made its debut at the exhibition with </font></font><a href="http://makezine.com/2014/01/16/the-state-of-3d-printing-and-scanning-after-ces-2014-the-push-for-mainstreaming-begins/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">a $ 499 machine</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - that was how much the Mini should cost according to the plans of MakerBot from 2012, which fell into the hands of Backchannel.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúBre really wanted to achieve this value, but no one could do it,‚Äù says Jeff Osborne, vice president of sales and business development from March 2012 to early 2013. ‚ÄúHe knew that the market needed a cheaper machine.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to one of the former employees, some of the machines shown at CES 2014 did not even work. But still they all received awards. ‚ÄúIt was a peak moment of hype, because even at CES they were ready to give awards for cars that could not even demonstrate their work,‚Äù he says. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sales at MakerBot in 2014 went well. The annual report of Stratasys reflects that MakerBot sold 39,356 printers in 2014, which is only 1994 printers fewer than in the entire period from 2009 to 2013. With each printer, there was </font></font><a href=""><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">an autograph note</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Petiza, where it was said that this machine "will give you a supernormal ability to do what you can imagine." By the fall </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, new MakerBot printers were already being sold </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">at </font></font><a href="http://www.makerbot.com/media-center/2014/11/24/makerbot-retail-partner-explore-3d-printing-staples"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Staples</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="https://3dprint.com/26153/home-depot-makerbot/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Home Depot</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They again had technical problems - but now the buyers could not help with their solution. More savvy users </font></font><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">wrote questions</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> to the MakerBot Operators Google Group. One of the most hostile users </font></font><a href="https://www.3dhubs.com/3d-printers/makerbot-replicator-5th-gen"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">said</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that "after the war that lasted a year, I lost patience." A petition </font></font><a href="https://www.change.org/p/makerbot-industries-product-recall-makerbot-5th-generation-3d-printer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">appeared</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on Change.org </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">demanding that MakerBot withdraw its printers.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the sources of user frustration was the Smart Extruder, which was supposed to inform the user that the plastic had run out. In the end, MakerBot and Stratasys </font></font><a href="http://makezine.com/2015/07/14/makerbot-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-faulty-extruders/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">were sued</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , claiming that the company deliberately released a non-working extruder. In July 2016, the </font></font><a href="https://3dprint.com/141757/makerbot-lawsuit-dismissed/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">case was closed</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> due to lack of evidence. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On Brokelyn.com, a former employee of the company, Isaac Anderson, </font></font><a href="http://brokelyn.com/makerbot-sells-out-as-seen-from-the-inside/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">accused</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in the failures of all three machines, the company's decision to get away from an open project. She could not rely on her customer base, consisting of "skilled and enthusiastic people who gave rich technological feedback and suggestions for improvement." The new class of buyers, as he wrote, "consisted of inept people, did not give useful feedback, but gave only unrealistic expectations." </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bill Buell was MakerBot's director of product development, producing three cars, shown at CES 2014. He says that the development of three cars at the same time as the deadline was very tense for engineering teams. But he also claims that each printer was actively tested, and complied with the company's specifications for a ready-to-sell product.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI understand why Brae wanted to release all three cars. He wanted an explosive reaction to CES, which was already a habit, ‚Äùsays Buell. ‚ÄúFrom an engineer‚Äôs point of view, it was a big risk.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The weak points of the printers began to reflect on the company. According to the results of the first quarter of 2015, the directors of Stratasys talked about the slowing down of the market for 3D printers, and mentioned that MakerBot sales were less than expected. In April 2015, Jonathan Yaglom, director of Stratasys, became the CEO of MakerBot, but the fate of some employees was already decided. That month, the company </font></font><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/makerbot-just-laid-off-20-percent-of-its-staff"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">said goodbye to one-fifth of the workers</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In October of that year, MakerBot fired a fifth of its employees again. ‚ÄúWe do not achieve results, which means financial problems,‚Äù </font></font><a href="http://fortune.com/2015/10/08/makerbot-lays-off-20-percent-of-staff-again/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yaglom told me then</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. According to reports, the company sold only 18,673 printers in 2015 - less than half of what it sold in 2014. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Last April, Yagolm announced that MakerBot would close a 16,000 m </font></font><sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2</font></font></sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> production facility </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in Brooklyn, fire more employees, and transfer all production to China while the company celebrated the sale of the 100,000th printer. Analysis of the company's reports showed that in the first three months of 2016, MakerBot sold only 1,421 printers. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúIn 2014, the company was confident that the consumer market was ripe. In 2015, we realized that the market was not what we had imagined, ‚ÄùYaglom told me on the day MakerBot announced the closure of the factory.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turned out that 3D printers are not such revolutionary devices, at least for now. Big companies like General Electric and Ford are experimenting with 3D printing and using it to produce parts. This year, GE </font></font><a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2016/09/general-electric-doubles-investment-in-3d-printing-with-1-4-billion-purchase/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">bought</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> two related companies for $ 1.4 billion. But the technology is still not reliable enough, not fast enough, and not cheap enough to replace traditional technologies.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is also a rather complicated process. To print the necessary object, you need to know how 3D design is created, which, of course, has become much easier to do thanks to online programs like TinkerCAD. But the extruder head may become blocked during printing. Substrate may warp. The result may be crooked, because of which it will be necessary to rotate the part next time. ‚ÄúIt takes a lot of work. This is not the case when you can press a button and get what you imagined, ‚Äùsays Rokhold. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the dizzying days of 3D printing, there were no questions that would be ignored, or tasks that would be put off until later. What is happening now Yaglom calls "the quieting hype" in the industry, when the perception of its society finally begins to coincide with reality. Stratasys stock value</font></font><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SSYS/history%3Fperiod1%3D1388552400%26period2%3D1446350400%26interval%3D1d%26filter%3Dhistory%26frequency%3D1d"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">stumbled and fell</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> from a record $ 136 in January 2014 to $ 25 in October 2015, when MakerBot announced the second wave of layoffs. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúPeople want everything to happen quickly, we live in the world of speed, but the entry of a new thing on the market takes time,‚Äù says Jenny Lawton, who joined MakerBot in 2011 and worked as an acting member. CEO from late 2014 to early 2015. ‚Äú3D printing is still in progress. She looks like an awkward teenager. ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Other 3D printing companies also </font></font><a href="http://fortune.com/2015/11/20/3d-printing-layoffs-3d-systems-stratasys/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">suffered</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .

At the end of that year, the company </font></font><a href="http://fortune.com/2015/12/29/3d-systems-cube-consumer-3d-printer/%3Fiid%3Dleftrail"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">decided to stop</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> selling Cube printers. Like MakerBot, it </font></font><a href="http://fortune.com/2015/11/27/why-makerbot-and-3d-systems-are-losing-the-desktop-3d-market/%3Fiid%3Dleftrail"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">hardly competed</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> with small startups, whose overhead costs were less and printers were cheaper. Today, Taiwanese XYZprinting has dropped </font></font><a href="http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160104-global-3d-printer-market-jumps-in-2015-thanks-to-desktop-3d-printer-sales.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">MakerBot from first place</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , becoming the global market leader for desktop 3D printers. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This year's </font></font><a href="http://wohlersassociates.com/2016report.htm"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wohlers Report</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, the annual report on the 3D printer market seems to be saying the opposite: last year, 270,000 desktop printers were sold. But mostly these machines are bought by commercial organizations and schools, and not by private individuals. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThe plan followed by MakerBot, 3D systems and others is an illusion ‚Äî one in which the average user of the house has one or more of these machines ‚Äî there is simply no market for them,‚Äù said Terry Wahlers, president of the consulting company publishing the report. ‚ÄúPerhaps it was in this that MakerBot was initially mistaken, considering that there is such a market.‚Äù</font></font><br><br>  * * * <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On a sunny morning in September, Jonathan Yaglom welcomed journalists, business leaders in Brooklyn and MakerBot employees gathered at the MetroTech Center. The company had good news. She released the sixth generation of desktop printers, Replicator + and Mini Replicator +. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the one-hour presentation, staff talked about enlarged frames for printing larger objects, improving software and hardware. The new application from MakerBot even allows the novice to go from the beginning to the end of the printing process. New printers are much quieter than the previous ones. They can finally work on the table without distracting people. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve completely redesigned them,‚Äù said Mark Palmer, head of user experience development at MakerBot, to the audience.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yaglom described changes in company policy. In the past, MakerBot "created products and hoped to find consumers." Now the company has changed: it asked users what they need, and developed products for their requests. This was done with an eye on the two markets for which, according </font></font><a href="http://fortune.com/2015/05/27/stratasys-ceo-david-reis-printing/%3Fiid%3Dleftrail"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to Yaglom</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , MakerBot would be best suited: professional engineers with designers, and teachers. Today, more than </font></font><a href="http://fortune.com/2015/09/25/makerbot-3d-printers-in-schools/%3Fiid%3Dleftrail"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5,000 schools</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in the US are MakerBot printers. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Petiz resigned as head of MakerBot in September 2014, and was about to head an ‚Äúinnovation workshop‚Äù at Stratasys called Bold Machines. The goal of the project is to prove that 3D printing can be used in </font></font><a href="http://www.boldmachines.com/projects-2/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">serious projects</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , and not only in the production of knickknacks. In June 2015, Bold Machines</font></font><a href="https://3dprint.com/73360/bre-pettis-leaves-stratasys/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">budded</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in a separate company. Today, Petis is running a </font></font><a href="https://bre.co/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bre &amp; Co.</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> startup </font><a href="https://bre.co/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , making "gifts of the level of family jewels", the first of which was a watch worth $ 5800. Petis avoids publicity. But many former employees express admiration for his assertiveness, dedication and visionaryism. ‚ÄúWithout Bret, the company would not be a milestone in the history of 3D printing,‚Äù said one of them.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Looking back, it is easy to criticize MakerBot for incorrectly assessing a potential market. Even icons of innovation are not always able to invent the future. ‚ÄúMakerBot, it was the first time people knew that there was a 3D print,‚Äù says Hartman, one of the very first employees. ‚ÄúIt seems to me that this is the essence of success, and at the same time that which led to defeat.
