  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian podcasting RPOD VS.PODFM</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I am Denis aka Radio Grinch podcaster from since spring 2008. <br>  Most of the text below applies to those who are interested in podcasts (listening to them or producing and publishing in runet). If you think that the text is too much, you can immediately go to the conclusion at the end of the note. <br><br>  God knows, I didn‚Äôt want to get involved in this califarous srach, but in my address statements like ‚ÄúI sold podfm‚Äù and almost accusations of treason were heard.  Therefore, I decided to express my thoughts about the situation.  For those who have not followed my podkasterskoy activities from the outset, summary: <br>  in March 2008 I found out what a podcast is, found rpod.ru and registered on it. <br>  by May 2008 it was from time to time to get into the top twenty podcasts, which are displayed and recommended on the main and input window rpod.ru <br>  In May 2008, began to receive regular letters and responses to published podcasts. <br>  It was first recommended by the master of the Russian-language podcasting Umputun on the main page of rpod.ru (there are about 7 people who have the right to post on the main page of rpod.ru separate podcasts under the heading "recommended", these are two admins: Arina and Yulia (furious angel), and also Umputun, Chai master, Rosnovsky, Vasily Strelnikov himself, and the project programmer Sergey Korovkin, probably Bobuk should have this privilege, but I never saw the podcasts recommended by him). <br>  In June 2008, following the advice of a well-known blogger (and later a podcast / laowaicast podcast) Alexander Maltsev from China, he created his own blog site, which was helped by the great NOD and Mikolka from Belarus. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  In May 2008, my podcast was mentioned many times in one of its podcasts by Eldar Murtazin (an analyst well-known in Telecom journalism), and mostly under the plus sign.  Then, Umputnun once again recommended one of my podcasts in August 2008. In May (I came back from the States and flew to Hong Kong, with a stop in Moscow for 1 day) invited one of the admins rpod.ru (Arina) to record an interview with her, she agreed.  This particular podcast was recommended by the representative of rpod.ru for the first and only time. <br>  In August 2008, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, Oryapka mentioned me in his podcast, and also the creator of podcasting as a phenomenon Adam Curry put my audio feedback into his podcast and commented on it. <br>  In the fall of 2008, I submitted an application for participation in the international competition of bloggers and podcasters from Deutsche Wave.  The podcast was accepted and, a few months later, reached the final, and then became the winner in this competition according to the jury.  As a result, I received prizes: a netbook, an external HDD and a free trip to Germany for several days, also a beautiful glass and mentioning of my site for a whole day in all news releases on NTV + mentions in various Internet resources, including Radio-T, in which Bobuk called me Belarusian.  :) <br>  Then, in an interview with the magazine Hacker, Rosnovsky recommended my podcast. <br>  In March 2009, I went to the Podcon 2009 ‚Äúconference‚Äù of podcasters and became acquainted with the rpodovskaya party.  There I received a prize for the best male podcast for the year 2008 and received a beautiful glass star.  It was not bad, but it was definitely not a conference, but a party-drinking party outside the city. <br>  In April 2009, he began a new English-speaking VSP project, in July he received an invitation from the main English-language terminal of podcasts (the one who created Adam Curry and which Vasya largely focuses on) to sign an advertising contract with them in this podcast with the corresponding deductions.  Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond my control, this project has turned down.  By the way, Vasya helped and made free screensavers with his trademark voice.  It was very nice of him. <br>  For the same project I managed to get another glass star from rpod.ru, already from 2010 subconcon (the other day I was given it). <br>  In the fall of 2009, Eldar Murtazin again mentioned my podcast on his blog. <br>  In December 2009, Umputun re-introduced my podcast on Avatar on rpod.ru, as well as on his twitter account. <br><br>  So, the main merit in the promotion and relative popularity of my podcasts, I assign to myself without false modesty (my activity and relatively good quality of my projects, against the background of most Russian-speaking podcasts), and secondly, I appropriate it to the information support of the above-mentioned people.  (In the second place, and not in the first, because there would not be a normal product, there would be nothing to recommend :)). <br>  To rpod.ru I can only attribute it to the creators of the terminal and the community, whose representatives sometimes meet in real life.  I didn‚Äôt receive any special support from them and participated in the life of the podcaster party on a general basis. <br>  Evaluating my podcaster efforts as relatively successful, I set out to find a way to monetize my podcast.  As an ideal, I consider a situation in which you can do your favorite thing and still get paid for it (no matter if it is big or not).  Podcasting can be safely called one of my favorite things, to which I devote a lot of time and effort.  I don‚Äôt really believe in donations yet in Russia.  I will experience it only after being disappointed in other ways.  In general, from time to time I began to look for some sponsors.  Honestly, at once, both creatively and financially, I somehow didn‚Äôt work very well.  Well, I still earned a bit of money on a podcast, but this was once and not a lot.

      <br>
      A couple of months ago, Maxim Spiridonov (head of the production center "Roiber" and founder of PODfm.ru) contacted me and invited me to become part of the PODfm editorial board, i.e.  a regular podcast author on PODFM.  He showed that PODfm is also a commercial project, and therefore the possibility of receiving some financial incentive is not excluded.  Maxim also promised to promote my podcasts within the site.  I took it, firstly, as another recognition of my work, and secondly, as a wonderful opportunity to promote my podcast even more and make it even more popular, and, of course, thirdly, the promise of financial stimulus also makes me happy.  Moreover, it was not a matter of me saying ‚Äúwrite music, as requested by the one who pays the money‚Äù.  Cooperation is absolutely mutually beneficial.  The only obligation on my part is to be a little more disciplined and release more and less predictable podcasts with predictable frequency. <br><br>  It is worth saying a few words about Podfm. <br>  If I remember correctly, podfm appeared in the summer of 2008.  I liked the site.  It was clearer, lighter and more aesthetically pleasing.  But oddly enough, a year later, Podfm did not attract the attention of users and cocked into the ‚Äúmirror‚Äù of the arpod (rpod.ru), only with very small downloads of podcasts and no comments from listeners.  I systematically laid out all my podcasts both on my website radiogrinch.ru, and on rpod.ru, on podfm.ru and on rambler, since each resource had its own audience.  (The biggest one is rpod.ru, the second by the number of downloads is rambler.ru and the smallest rating was for podfm.ru) I thought (probably like the creators of the resource) that over time, podfm will gather its audience and become a competitor to rpod.ru.  Oddly enough, but time passed, but this did not happen. <br>  For me it was always not clear why podfm could not ‚Äúshoot‚Äù in any way during its existence.  Technically (IMHO) podfm was better than rpod.ru because it added several functions and expanded the capabilities of podcasters (for example, it made it possible to insert the player code with a particular episode into any blog or website) <br>  Time passed, and the situation has not changed.  From the very beginning, pod.rm made it possible to embed pictures, photos in the podcast itself to illustrate what was going on.  This feature was unique, but it also did not prove to be in demand by podcasters.  Although for example for podcast reviews or podcasts, reporting is a very good option.  An attempt to save the situation, as I understand it, was the ability to add automatic support for relaying the view from any other site that was added later.  She did not save the situation.  The following situation has developed: the same people publish the same podcasts on these two terminals.  These people are not so many, and most of what they produce into the world is almost impossible to listen to.  In the end, the right decision was made in my opinion.  Since technical improvements to the terminal podcast do not bring the desired result and its popularity is not growing, it means you need to do something that would distinguish it from rpod.ru radically.  It was decided to reformat podfm.ru and turn it from a podcast terminal into an audio magazine, setting the main task to make it a rag on which it is EASY TO FIND GOOD PODCASTS and HARD TO FIND THE BAD.  In this regard, the site itself is changing and the development strategy has changed.  Now on PODFM.ru, an editorial staff is created by the permanent authors who will become a kind of face of this site.  That is, the first person to get there will meet this part of the body (figuratively speaking), and not the opposite. <br>  So, I was invited to collaborate and in some sense work on the Internet audio magazine (something like Internet radio) only programs that are released in the form of podcasts to which you can subscribe.  To date, the first thing that a person sees when entering the site is podcasts ‚Äúmade on podfm), the second level is podcasts under the heading‚Äú podfm recommends ‚Äùand only then you can delve into everything else. <br><br>  Even before I released my first podfm podcast, I decided to experiment with publishing podcasts from the podfm server.  Of course, I was surprised when I discovered that no podcast file located on the podfm server can be published on rpode.  Just if you register a link in the required field, when you try to publish you get an inscription that it is not possible ‚Äúfor technical reasons‚Äù :) <br>  So, my first, slightly raw, slightly provocative podcast on podfm came out.  I was a little worried that downloads would be as pathetic as before, when I posted on this resource.  But I was pleasantly surprised when, two days after publication, 560 downloads, 38 approvals and a lot of comments were recorded.  Two days after posting to podfm, I threw the same file onto rpod.  (at the beginning of the podcast, the words ‚Äúthis podcast was made on Podfm) Everything is as usual - that is,  published at midnight, and by noon I checked the statistics, there were about 120 downloads and a couple of comments.  But what was my surprise when I returned home, I found that my podcast was missing.  I called Yulia, one of the two admins of the arpod.  She said she did not know anything.  I checked mail and direct messages on rpod and found nothing.  I threw a question on Twitter and some time later I received the following message from the second admin Arina: ‚Äúthe podcast was removed for propaganda of a subfma.  if you have questions - bigpodcast@gmail.com "Who does not know, this is the personal address of Vasily Borisovich - the father of the founder of rpod.ru <br>  I had to perezalit, but from my server.  Now I don‚Äôt know what to think about Strelnikov.  Best of all, probably, not to think about him at all.  Because for me, it‚Äôs just a name and appearance, a pleasant and inviting voice and the knowledge that he was very popular and he also created the first Russian podcast terminal.  That is, I don‚Äôt know him at all, and he did too, (once they shook hands and let slip a couple of phrases and a couple of emails).  That's good, so let it remain.  Because I do not want to think about him badly.  It is not easy for him to meet his old age and get used to the idea that the peak of popularity is over.  May God grant him more joyful moments in life and close people nearby. <br>  Well, I briefly (or not so briefly) described to you the situation, and you yourself decide who I betrayed and sold to myself.  If someone thinks that I am the offspring of rpod.ru and Vasily Borisovich personally, then you can brand me as a traitor and put a cross on me, remove my podcasts from your rrs generators and defraud me on Twitter.  Thereby you will help me to sort out inadequate people from the list of my listeners.  :) <br><br>  You may ask if I believe in the success of PODfm?  In such an amazing and unpredictable country as ours, almost nothing can be accurately predicted.  But comparing the development strategy of podfm and rpod, I have to admit that I prefer the business approach of Maxim Spiridonov.  In the picture of the future Maxim draws there is a place for me and for any talented podcaster.  In what Vasya does, I can only become one of hundreds of banderlogov, who look into the mouth of a boa constrictor, or at most fit into a narrower circle of contacts and from time to time shake hands with him again and drink in nature.  Neither scenario seems attractive to me.  I am 36 years old (marks April 5) a family, and two children.  If I were a pimply teenager, it might have been my dream, but not now.  So summarize. <br><br>  What rpod.ru for me?  It: <br>  1. A podcast terminal where anyone can start experimenting with podcasting. <br>  2. Site for dating podcasters and eavesdroppers <br>  3. Party fans Vasily Strelnikov <br>  5. Annual booze in Sofrino with the opportunity to touch Vasya and Bobuk <br>  Is the question good?  Yes, why not, if you like to have fun and take pictures with Vasya, drink a glass with ‚Äúpisyuhanami‚Äù (Makharadze and Kartaev - great guys, by the way) and then show off to your friends ... you hear the dude on the radio says, I know him, booze together near Moscow. <br>  However, for the development of podcasting in Russia as a phenomenon and for the development of my own podcast, this is not very good.  I was on one podkon, I liked it, if this year did not prevent the circumstances, I would go again.  Maybe next year I will go, if relations with the organizing committee of the event and the leadership of rpod.ru do not deteriorate <br><br>  What is podfm for me?  It: <br>  1. Recognition of my creativity leadership <br>  2. New page in life <br>  3. Upgrading my podcasts <br>  4. Greater self-discipline and great responsibility to the listener <br>  5. Technical support <br>  5. Possibility to monetize your podcast <br><br>  That's probably the end.  Comments are welcome. <br>  Sincerely, Denis aka Radio Grinch. <br><br>  PS here are a few blog posts so that you roughly imagine the background against which current events take place.
