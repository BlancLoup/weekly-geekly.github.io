  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Technical tour to the TEL data center</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In our posts on Habr√© we have already written <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/telhosting/blog/113706/">about the working days of</a> our employees and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/telhosting/blog/124232/">how work is organized</a> within <a href="http://hosting.tel.ru/">TEL Hosting</a> .  Now it's time to talk about the infrastructure and equipment of our data center. <br><br>  <i><strong>The TEL data center</strong></i> is located in the East of Moscow, in the Preobrazhensky administrative center, on Elektrozavodskaya st. 24. The building has a convenient car entrance and private parking.  Nearby are the metro station "Electrozavodskaya" and "Transfiguration".  The TEL data center, as well as the entire business center in which it is located, is under the round-the-clock qualified security guard.  In addition, a technical support service is located on the premises of the data center, which also operates around the clock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5887c84b/924bec92/003a0151/9de3a3fe.jpg">

      All approaches to the building, the entrance to the premises of the data center, the camera room and the tight area are under outdoor and indoor video surveillance.  Access to the building is by pass.  You can get inside the data center only by prior arrangement.  Inside the camera and hermozone perfect purity is maintained.  Dry and wet cleaning is carried out regularly.  Absolutely all visitors to the data center are obliged to shoe shoe covers issued at the entrance.  Such strict ‚Äúhospital‚Äù procedures apply to the data center employees themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e9beed08/6760149f/a2983a6c/85d902a4.jpg"><br><br>  We allow clients to the data center to work with their equipment, but at the same time, the presence of our employees is mandatory, so other owners of servers may not worry about their safety.  The entrance to the containment zone of the DC is equipped with the Abloy lock system and electronic access identification.  Not only strangers can get inside.  Not even all TEL Hosting employees have access.  In this case, the system operates in one-way mode.  In order to leave the containment area, the use of electronic keys is not required, therefore, in the event of emergency situations inside, it will not be difficult to leave the room. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6c0d66c2/c55fc07f/0a6dd0b9/68fd49fc.jpg"><br><br>  Our engineers conduct regular monitoring of equipment operation.  In the event of any failures or abnormal situations, employees immediately receive a corresponding alert (including SMS alert).  Information on the operation of the equipment inside the data center is constantly read from the sensors and is fed to the data center's operators using its own monitoring system SimpleView.  If necessary, make the necessary adjustments.  In addition, qualified engineers of the data center regularly carry out maintenance work provided for by the regulations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/def90616/0f7b3311/78511d58/cad9e631.jpg"><br><br>  In the TEL data center, focused cooling is applied.  The maximum cooling of IT equipment was taken into focus (which is, in fact, the essence of the data center air-conditioning system), and the racks are located according to the Canovate cold / hot corridor architecture.  In the ‚Äúcold‚Äù corridor, raised floor plates with 38% perforation produced by Jansen (Belgium) are used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7b4cc80f/2fee22c5/7528f3b9/968e0743.jpg"><br><br>  The raised floor of the Jansen brand, which is used in our data center, has a loading capacity of 1.5 tons per square meter, but even with all this heavy equipment stands on its own frames.  All communications necessary for the life of the data center are under raised floors.  Plates are installed in the joint, without fastening, therefore, if necessary, to the communications provides quick access.  The height of the raised floor from the base to the final coating in the TEL Data Center is one meter.  Additionally, we note that the floors in our data center meet all regulatory requirements and documents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/25adc8f8/cc6bb213/68cee7e1/063e4c79.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ab376c07/99f559c3/72ab5aec/ebf0069a.jpg"><br><br>  The TEL data center uses modern fire extinguishing technology and fire safety prevention.  Non-combustible materials were used during construction.  On the territory of the camera and hermozone, and even under the raised floor there are installed fire detectors and indicators.  The possibility of fire is almost eliminated.  However, the presence of fire extinguishing equipment in the data center is mandatory.  Our data center uses a gas fire extinguishing system using the latest-generation extinguishing agent Novec 1230. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/761dddd8/cd50e9c1/01895926/9aa75829.jpg"><br><br>  The main advantage of gas means of neutralizing fires is the absence of harm to equipment, in contrast to foam, water or powder extinguishing methods, because gases do not conduct electricity.  The gas used is completely safe for humans, it has no color and smell.  The elimination of fire is achieved by displacing oxygen with Novec 1230 gas. It resembles water by the type of impact, but it does it more efficiently.  Novec 1230 even got the nickname - ‚Äúdry water‚Äù.  Gas is discharged from nozzles distributed throughout the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe data center premises. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fce9d90f/27f639c9/c3699e47/831e2270.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/124d391d/918d66c2/c888398d/c6f4c5ec.jpg"><br><br>  Comfortable conditions for server equipment in terms of temperature and humidity are provided by the precision air-conditioning system produced in Italy by De Longhi using the N + 2 system, each with a cooling capacity of 79.7 kW (air consumption 27,000 m3 / h) with built-in steam humidifiers.  Our data center is equipped with a drainage system for pumping water, in case of flooding, and a condensate drain system.  To detect water using special sensors under the raised floor.  The external air conditioning units are located in the courtyard of the business center.  They are located in two floors on a specially constructed site.  The regulatory distance to the wall of 0.8 meters allows employees to carry out the necessary maintenance work with the equipment in a comfortable environment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/86612684/92638b65/0bc72824/e1397b04.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/85c4c780/3234d9ad/d0b181c4/b050ac13.jpg"><br><br>  The diesel generator manufactured by MNPO "Energospetstekhnika" has in its base the generator of the French company Genelec and uses the engine of the brand MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH.  This company has been part of DaimlerChrysler AG for more than 30 years and is a recognized world leader in the manufacture of diesel engines for use in various fields of industry, technology, transport and energy.  The location of the unit in the parking lot of the business center is convenient for the entry of trucks and makes it possible to refuel a diesel generator.  There is enough fuel in it for 8 hours of work with the data center fully loaded.  Every month we conduct routine testing of the system for the automatic transfer of the reserve and the launch of the diesel generator set. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e057f784/eba266a4/3e03afb4/f19c1777.jpg"><br>  Cabinet of remote control of electrical unit <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/de5324d3/691919b1/c95d44b9/d2e2d9ad.jpg"><br>  ABB automatic reserve transfer <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b277ac4c/4683aa4d/73e4d6c7/3a3fd195.jpg"><br>  Bypass in the data center <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/43143b57/e209dd3c/325c2966/032d0ff2.jpg"><br>  Backup input from DGU <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/df521790/a82f962a/67d48e85/8fa329d7.jpg"><br>  Uninterruptible Power Supplies Socomec Delphys Green Power 180kW on the system N + 1.
