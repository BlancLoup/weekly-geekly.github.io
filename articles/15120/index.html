  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Relive vacation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Many in our area do not really like to relax.  The Internet is developing by leaps and bounds, sometimes a 2-week vacation can turn into a "late" start of the next project and as a result - the loss of money. <br>  However, personally, I am sure that this holiday is sacred =) I don‚Äôt really like the sea and the beaches, but I enjoy staying in the pool with pleasure, I drink Turkish viskar and play table tennis.  (I will immediately make a reservation, further in the context of Turkey = vacation) <br>  And then another problem arises, how to support projects when no one is around?  From Turkey to the Internet cafe is not an option.  For then I will hang around there for days, meaning to go on vacation?  Asking friends out, of course, but we live in the 21st century pancake. <br>  I'll tell you how I set sail for 2 weeks and left my basher.ru to develop, which makes no sense without daily updates ... <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let me remind you that basher.ru is an aggregator of such resources as <a href="http://bash.org.ru/">bash.org.ru</a> , <a href="http://quotes.dirty.ru/">quotes.dirty.ru</a> , <a href="http://ibash.org.ru/">ibash.org.ru</a> , <a href="http://lorquotes.ru/">lorquotes.ru</a> and some others.  Accordingly, for the life of the project it is important that the updates are timely.  I have written not complicated parsers that collect quotes with a certain periodicity.  However, the guys from <a href="http://bash.org.ru/">bash.org.ru</a> immediately banned the ip server and from there quotations stopped collecting.  There was a vacation on the nose and it was necessary to think something and somehow solve the problem. <br>  The solution was found quite quickly - to raise the proxy on the local machine and bots on the server are knocking through the proxy. <br>  No sooner said than done.  <a href="http://3proxy.ru/download/">We swing 3proxy</a> under the axis we need and configure it.  My config looks very simple: <br> <code>nserver 192.168.1.1 <br> nscache 65536 <br> service <br> log c:\3p\bin\3proxy.log <br> logformat "L%C - %U [%d/%o/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z] ""%T"" %E %I %O %N/%R:%r" <br> auth iponly <br> deny all <br> allow * 217.65.2.216 <br> allow * 192.168.* <br> proxy -a <br></code> <br>  Initially, we specify the dns server and cache location, the service command indicates the installation of a proxy as a service (for weak windows axes or one-time use, you can also run as an application. Similarly for nix).  auth iponly - start only from certain ip, which are listed below (respectively, 217.65.2.216 server address, 192.168. * - lokalka).  -a flag says 3proxy about complete anonymity; no headers like X_FORWARDED_FOR and so on will be transmitted. <br><br>  That's all.  After writing the config, install 3proxy and you're done. <br>  The second problem is dynamic ip.  At first, it seemed to be a minus, because for a few hours I could not remember the magic service dyndns.com.  Now I understand that this is a huge plus.  After all, to get rid of my bots, "honest" resource owners will have to ban the entire Stream ... <br>  But now is not about that.  The Internet gives me a <a href="http://zyxel.ru/content/catalogue/soho/center/adsl/204">magic device from ZyXel</a> .  To my surprise, it was already able to work with the dyndns.com service, it had detailed instructions for working with it and a user-friendly interface.  Let me remind you that dyndns.com is a service that distributes third-level domains with dynamic ip.  It's simple, you register, choose a domain for yourself, install their software, which with each connection reports your ip, and have a third level domain.  Those.  Once you are logged in, dyndns.com updates the location of the blablabal.blogdns.net computer, for example, and any user of the network can contact your computer by domain. <br><br>  So, in my case, I didn‚Äôt even have to install the software, I just fed Zuksel with the access details on dyndns.com and configured NAT to my internal ip (all the details and subtleties are on their Russian-language forum). <br>  That's all.  It remained to feed the script the address (domain) and the port for the proxy and now the server bots follow the proxy quotes, i.e.  through local comp.  Yes, the computer requires to be constantly on and on the network for this scheme to work.  But in fact, I don‚Äôt remember when I last turned off the computer.  In extreme cases, you can go to the market, buy an old stub for 1000 rubles, put it behind the cabinet and stick fiber into it.  But not the point. <br>  For greater loyalty in the BIOS, I set up an "alarm clock" for the company at 7 am every day.  Little did the electricity go down and left with a calm soul.
