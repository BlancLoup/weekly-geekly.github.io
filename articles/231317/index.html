On the other hand, a propelled smartphone, which is quite different from the G2.  And most importantly, the G3 bypasses in the aggregate of parameters all top-end android smartphones.  True, the key word here: temporarily. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

But smartphones start with design.  First of all, pay attention to the "like a metal cover."  Why how?  It is still plastic with metal foil imprinted on it, which has a ‚Äúpolished aluminum‚Äù texture.  Someone would call it a half-measure - they say, not even a ‚Äúsoap box‚Äù from Samsung, but not a metal from HTC either.  But in general, such a decision gives charm and more practical than bare plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/880/901/dbe/880901dbe03f73baabe261bc6e3c8a64.png"><br><br>  The design of the buttons on the back has also changed.  Visually, it can be seen very well.  Feels the same.  Although the main button has a distinct "click". <br><br>  By the way, when we <a href="http://bit.ly/1nPvvtd">reviewed the G2</a> , there were doubts about the practicality of this solution.  As it turned out, a person gets used to everything - in a month you start looking for buttons on the back of other smartphones or try to turn on the device with a double tap on the screen.  Nevertheless, it is hardly possible to call such a move ideal.  Original, yes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/944/2c4/cfd/9442c4cfd2c2907efca65fa1c9b55d1c.png"><br><br>  The speaker was also moved to the back surface - in the G2 it was placed on the bottom.  Most likely, this is caused by a change in the internal layout.  But such a decision did not affect the purity and volume of the sound. <br><br>  Go to the screen.  If in one word, then among the flagships he is the only one - 2560x1440 pixels.  Naturally, with an unreal pixel density of 538 per inch.  Otherwise - this is the Quad HD screen.  Oppo Find 7, however, boasts the same resolution. True, the Oppy has no FM receiver, and this solves a lot (sarcasm!). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c29/6a8/d8e/c296a8d8efee90940cea7b0923d68564.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/961/57a/d93/96157ad931ff40070744b691f411e205.png"><br><br>  In the case of the G3, it makes no sense to talk about all the parameters of the screen there - such as brightness, viewing angles, etc.  They are great.  And the quality of the image itself is compared to good printing.  And indeed it is.  However, when you brag about a new smartphone, do not forget to mention it - a non-specialist will hardly notice the difference from Full HD. <br><br>  What is most interesting.  Screen size - 5.46 inches - in fact it is a phablet.  But in terms of size ... It is only 2 millimeters wider than the S5 in width, half a millimeter shorter than Z2 and a half millimeter thinner than the HTC One M8.  How did they do it?  Crammed! <br><br>  The upgrade of the interface in G3 came very seriously - the company even released a video explaining the choice of the design concept.  The color scheme really became quieter.  In addition, LG adopted a fashion for round icons.  True, in the settings they decided to hold back the tumult of the ‚Äúrounder‚Äù, which in the same Galaxy S5 are confusing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fda/ef4/afb/fdaef4afb8a395abdf1573e385769669.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5fc/eb6/a89/5fceb6a89d0cee971e4d04cbe81ce68f.png"><br><br>  The LG Health fitness app has appeared - it is more modest than the service from Samsung, but not very demanding fans of healthy lifestyles may be useful.  Switching between applications has changed - their icons are now displayed on the screen in the form of a ‚Äúgrid‚Äù.  Is it better or worse?  Just changed.  There is also the possibility of displaying two windows on the screen, which can sometimes be really useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/707/c59/2a7/707c592a76d9501670e3b3ddc47bbeba.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a1/312/a3b/0a1312a3b97236f8339a38668cd211e5.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/090/676/7b7/0906767b7829cfe630f26918bce6da91.png"><br><br>  There is where to turn and lovers of interface settings for themselves.  Of the interesting "chips" - setting up on-screen icons (you can create your own image and resize), change the height of the keyboard (within fairly wide limits), and unlock the smartphone using Knock Code taps (you must repeat the predefined sequence of "tapes" in 4 screen areas ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92b/2ef/d31/92b2efd315c37e60b8687d5c8a4af7e9.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a4/d64/2da/0a4d642dacb0e16f42d9a8fc97ca3719.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d66/b0c/066/d66b0c0665f440cc38c232d1cb130585.png"><br><br>  G3 is a real flagship.  Snapdragon 801 2.5 Hz, 2 gigabytes of RAM, sixteen - user memory.  By the way, in some places you can find gray models with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of user memory - pay attention. <br><br>  No lags, no brakes when you use your smartphone, you will not notice, but in the benchmarks the notorious FPS may not be so high. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44f/bbe/8ce/44fbbe8ce898b7b36f026b4af572426d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f13/ad4/4dd/f13ad44dd6b08c48036dc29530893f3d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66c/a5c/00a/66ca5c00a1064d8ca5f28576a0eb6f19.png"><br><br>  The resolution of both cameras has not changed.  But there were innovations that make it easier to get high-quality photos: first, the optical stabilization system (OIS +), secondly, the dual LED flash and, most importantly, ultrafast autofocus.  LG called it ‚Äúlaser‚Äù, but it is based on infrared technology.  The sensor works in a third of a second and perfectly complements the traditional phase and contrast autofocus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7e/147/6b6/f7e1476b6054a8b70ca5487dc9563866.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/295/cc5/8f6/295cc58f6f8b7e0a181271d37a172c70.png"><br><br>  Settings - at least.  And this is good.  In the sense that you are invited to think less and trust the smartphone.  Photo quality is excellent.  Although in some frames, software processing could be more modest. <br><br>  As a tribute to the tradition of the function appeared "magic autofocus."  It works simply - it takes several photos with different depth of field, and the user then selects the option he likes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61e/358/d15/61e358d155183323414624747c776b78.png"><br><br>  Of the other interesting features - automatic HDR mode, shooting "selfie" by voice and using gestures.  G3 can write video in 4K resolution, as well as in 120 frames per second mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/967/e4f/909/967e4f9099a9f0c81f05594aa21711ca.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd2/431/598/cd24315988424aaf8e04faf1d9b53cc2.png"><br><br>  And again about the back cover.  Yes, it is removable.  Under the cover is a 3000 mAh capacity battery, SIM slots and microSD up to 128 gigabytes.  And in the lid hiding inductive coil for wireless charging.  This thing really works - the convenience is obvious.  Cons - the device heats up and takes longer to charge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d35/78d/25f/d3578d25f38bb79b982ce607f04308b3.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af1/2c3/e6c/af12c3e6c73f403c323983102dcfcfef.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f4/c98/9f5/2f4c989f53513fc014356c90f6edcf1f.png"><br><br>  Yes, despite the rather powerful battery, the miracle did not happen - the device still keeps somewhat less than the G2 - by a quarter of subjective feelings.  For those who love numbers, the G3 video playback lasted less than 6 hours. <br><br>  We also secured the ace in the sleeve - more precisely, on the wrist - especially for those who still hesitate in choosing a smartphone.  The LG G Watch is finally on sale.  This is the company's first experience in the smart watch segment - and in this situation LG plays the role of a follower. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/598/d18/b1d/598d18b1d28943edaa894a384e9f0fdd.png"><br><br>  <b>LG G Watch</b> <b><br></b>  price: 8,000 rubles. <br><br>  <i>screen: 1.65 ", 280x280, IPS, sensor</i> <i><br></i>  <i>OS: Android Wear</i> <i><br></i>  <i>support: Android 4.3+</i> <i><br></i>  <i>processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, 1.2 GHz</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0</i> <i><br></i>  <i>RAM: 512 MB</i> <i><br></i>  <i>memory: 4 GB</i> <i><br></i>  <i>protection: IP67</i> <i><br></i>  <i>battery: 400 mAh</i> <i><br></i>  <i>dimensions, weight: 46.5x37.9x9.95 mm, 63 g</i> <i><br></i> <br>  LG Watch perfectly complements the G3 - however, like any other smartphone, on Android 4.3 and higher.  The clock is synchronized with the smartphone via Bluetooth, running the special version of Android - Android Wear - and can not only display any notifications on the screen, but also controlled by voice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f5/463/5de/3f54635defb546ccd0affc3bb9ffd6a0.png"><br><br>  Suffice to say ‚ÄúOkay, Google,‚Äù and then say one of fifty voice commands to display the information you need - the data is first downloaded to the smartphone from the Internet, and then automatically transferred to the LG Watch.  With the help of this watch you can also dictate notes, write messages and letters.  In general, the thing is not only funny, but also useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ce/8d8/fcd/1ce8d8fcd3735ed531473879ca0f958c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/600/86f/b84/60086fb849e40576272b7a6766d45ed5.png"><br><br>  Design - strict.  The case is protected from moisture and dust.  The watch is charged with the help of a special magnetic mini-cradle.  Which, by the way, will have to be used quite often: the battery capacity of 400 mAh, alas, is only enough for half a day - perhaps this is due to the fact that we got a test copy of the G Watch for review, but in any case we have to admit that such a gadget call "long-playing" with all due respect to LG will not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b71/9d2/c30/b719d2c302f9c98bd33d3d26ab5b6cc7.png"><br><br>  Let's sum up.  G3 today is by far the most powerful and interesting on the totality of indicators smartphone.  Naturally, this will not last long.  But now this is probably the best investment.  As the ancient Romans said - carpe diem, take a moment ... <br><br>  But do not go to the philosophers to understand - we live in a non-ideal world.  And G3 has vulnerabilities.  His strength and his weakness is a screen that takes away both processor power and battery capacity. <br><br>  There is another drawback - the lack of moisture protection.  Unfortunately, the importance of this parameter was felt by myself: shortly before the review was prepared, the LG G2 smartphone was drowned - the device was dropped into a shallow pond and immediately taken out, dried (a non-removable battery was installed in G2).  The smartphone continues to work, but, alas, does not respond to manipulations with the touch screen, and the hardware buttons work through time.  It remains to wish the readers of ‚ÄúHabr‚Äù dexterity, prudence, and adequate behavior on reservoirs. <br><br>  Subscribe to <a href="http://bit.ly/GTF_YouTube">the Geek to the Future channel</a> , join groups in social networks and do not forget - the future is in our hands! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231317/</a></p>
