The main is the online store. <br><br>  From April to July 2013, factory sales have plummeted.  This applies not only to the online store, but also to the company's representatives in the regions (about 140 stores and stores).  We analyzed the situation, it turned out that sales fell almost all furniture makers.

      The factory is currently developing a new online store, but this song is very long, and the solution we needed was very, very fast and effective.  In the end, people constantly buy furniture and make repairs. <br><br>  As the experiment showed, we found a really effective way. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Decision </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d8/a40/52c/1d8a4052c5d1df0b135cedd706765d7a.jpg">  Hand on heart, it can be said that the factory in Russia is known, but not widely enough. <br>  We have taken the idea that any company becomes known thanks to the best one or the product that distinguishes it from competitors. <br><br>  For example, Yandex is both a search, a mail and an information portal, but it is still perceived as a search engine.  Or Mail.ru - there is also a search and news and a bunch of other services, but it is associated with the mail. <br><br>  Bottom line: we decided to turn to the new-fashioned ‚Äúpromo-pages‚Äù, or rather, single-page sites that present one product with the ability to fill in and send data from the feedback form or phone call. <br><br>  From the variety of products of the factory (more than 1,500 possible modules and goods) we chose a very narrow niche - beds with a lifting mechanism, since  competition in this segment is relatively small, and demand is <a href="http://wordstat.yandex.ru/%3Fcmd%3Dwords%26page%3D1%26t%3D%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%2B%25D1%2581%2B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%258A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%2B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%26geo%3D%26text_geo%3D">quite decent</a> . <br><br>  Even in the case of selecting only one product, we were faced with the fact that you can offer wardrobes and bedside tables and dressers for the bed and the bed itself can be made in at least 15 color variants, and the size range is also wide. <br><br>  But we focused on what is most popular, according to statistics from J.Wordstat, a double bed of a certain size.  This made it possible to show only one product and one price, so as not to confuse the buyer. <br><br><h4>  Attract attention and keep </h4><br>  Together with the designers and technologists, we identified 9 main features of the bed, which distinguish it from other similar products (as well as beds that have drawers). <br><br>  <b>Here is the initial stern list:</b> <br><ul><li>  Sophisticated design and functionality </li><li>  Delivery time for a bed under a mattress 1600 √ó 2000 mm - 3 days </li><li>  Several variations of color performance </li><li>  The bed opens smoothly and almost effortlessly thanks to German gas springs. </li><li>  Durability and reliability are provided with high-quality imported fittings </li><li>  Average useful volume is 1,5 times more in comparison with drawers </li><li>  Vertical opening allows you to set the bed in a small bedroom </li><li>  No dust on stored items </li><li>  Durable bed tray allows you to store heavy things. </li></ul><br>  <b>And 2 additional points:</b> <br><ul><li>  Many options for bed width: 900, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800 mm </li><li>  Optional accessories: chest of drawers, bedside tables, dressing table </li></ul><br><br>  After that we selected a few photos that show the bed in all its glory (the factory takes a photo in its own film studio): <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c43/8ec/ddf/c438ecddf09735468246510a9433d49c.jpg"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a3b/93c/318/a3b93c3188487a56c08c90346d32ff50.jpg"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc9/a9d/a07/dc9a9da0722db8fb12ffe2eb90c36ff5.jpg"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/855/077/748/8550777489dccc65760244e463089c61.jpg"><br><br clear="all"><br>  Having developed the first layout, we are faced with the fact that the page was boring.  After going through several dozens of successful variants of promo-pages of famous brands, we made 3 design options, from which we chose this one: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/985/b6a/2d5/985b6a2d524e9f48bdde6b07886c285b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Its essence is to focus on the main thing - high-quality photos, and features visually combine into 3 blocks, supported by detailed photos:</b> <br><ul><li>  Reliability and lightness </li><li>  Convenience store </li><li>  Ability to choose from several options of colors and sizes </li></ul><br><br>  <b>What happened:</b> <a href="http://astron-mf.ru/singlepage2/">http://astron-mf.ru/singlepage2/</a> <br><br><h4>  Where to get visitors </h4><br>  We considered contextual advertising to be the fastest way to get an audience, the effectiveness of the solution can be checked in just 2 weeks. <br><br>  We selected about 20 key phrases and cut off unnecessary (for example, ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, ‚Äúinexpensive‚Äù and ‚Äúdo-it-yourself‚Äù), and in the ads focused <b>on two main advantages</b> : <br><ul><li>  Lead time 3 days </li><li>  Ease of use and reliable construction </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br><ul><li>  Campaign duration - 2 weeks </li><li>  The number of visitors to the page is about 800 people. </li><li>  Costs - only 6 000 rubles. </li><li>  The total number of calls and applications by e-mail to the sales department - 40 </li><li>  The number of buyers - 6 </li><li>  Conversion of calls and calls to customers - 15% </li><li>  For all the phrases used in the ad there were at least 3 visits by visitors </li></ul><br><br>  It is quite clear that on the page you can improve a lot and attract the audience from other sources, but for such a quick solution we got a very adequate result. <br><br>  In addition, it should be noted the excellent work of the company's managers, on whom the visitor‚Äôs desire to become a buyer ultimately depends. <br><br>  A small observation: during the advertising campaign, we were faced with the fact that sometimes the calls were out of hours, so we placed a mode of operation in the header of the page.  The problem was solved: the number of calls during off-hours became almost zero, and the number of requests by e-mail increased. <br><br>  I hope this article will help not only furniture companies, but also all those who are engaged in bringing new products to the market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188614/</a></p>
