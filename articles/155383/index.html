Part 3 - for the economical and loaded</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As promised, today I will finish a brief excursion about the three parts into the world of software from Kyocera.  It is the turn of solutions for managing data output. <br><br>  Kyocera offers a solid pool of applications for organizing work with documents.  The basis is simple: it does not matter whether the document is presented in print or electronic, it is important to ensure that it is in the right place at the right time. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The site has an <a href="http://bit.ly/R7OBdR">official definition</a> for this direction: <br><h6>  "Solutions for managing data output are used to monitor and control <br>  distribution and delivery of paper and electronic copies of documents <br>  providing reliable and consistent data output.  However, in a networked environment <br>  documents are now not only printed but also delivered electronically (by <br>  email, fax and Internet).  It is here that management solutions <br>  data output can change a lot.  In addition, solutions for accounting <br>  documents and jobs can track print and copy operations for <br>  financial control and organizational purposes.  Users can analyze <br>  and study costs, and control the allocation of resources. ‚Äù <br></h6><br>  The desire to streamline the workflow is definitely good, it has a positive effect on the productivity of employees and the prosperity of natural resources;  From all of this, customer satisfaction is growing, so Kyocera could not stand aside and approached the development as seriously as possible. <br><br>  <strong>KYOcount</strong> - this program is already described in the <a href="http://bit.ly/TFWU2X">second part of the</a> story (about admin software), but you must indicate that it contains output control elements, and therefore has the right to be mentioned in two sections. <br><br>  <strong>KYOeasyprint</strong> is already a very specific representative of the distribution management application family: <br><ul><li>  prints documents in different printers and in different departments / divisions; </li><li>  prints on paper from different trays (you can use better paper for presentations and worse - for invoices, for example); </li><li>  selects different finishing options; </li><li>  prints watermarks; </li><li>  if necessary, it does not print at all, but immediately sends it by fax or to file storages; </li><li>  generates forms, superimposed elements, etc.  - the ability to collect collect pages from blocks is indispensable in companies with a large turnover. </li></ul><br> <a href="http://bit.ly/S7zyAQ"><img title="01" src="http://bit.ly/S7zyAQ" height="477" width="625"></a> <br><br>  Special skills for working with the program will not be required by users, but the development of tasks taking into account the existing process at the enterprise must be carried out by the administrator. <br><br>  The main thing is to set up streams, and then for users all the processing of documentation will take place in one click: <br><br> <a href="http://bit.ly/RMhxZw"><img title="02" src="http://bit.ly/RMhxZw" height="448" width="625"></a> <br><br>  <strong>KYOroute</strong> - modifies the print job depending on the type of document and conditions, for example: <ul><li>  sends B &amp; W (black and white) assignments only to B &amp; W devices; </li><li>  sends large tasks to productive devices; </li><li>  redirects jobs if the printer, for example, does not respond. </li></ul><br> <a href="http://bit.ly/RcgSyB"><img title="03" src="http://bit.ly/RcgSyB" height="484" width="608"></a> <br><br>  To use KYOroute, you need to decide on the print policy: <br><ul><li>  Who has access to which systems? </li><li>  What tasks can be printed in color? </li><li>  What tasks can be printed on desktop printers? </li><li>  What documents should be printed in duplex? </li><li>  What if the device is unavailable or busy? </li></ul><br>  As a reward you will receive: <br><ul><li>  reduction of overhead costs (consumables and resource equipment); </li><li>  easily scalable document printing policy; </li><li>  saved ecology; </li><li>  increased workflow rate; </li></ul><br>  The utility is easy to configure, all rules are created at a high level by the user without training, for example: <br><br>  <em>"If the system is busy, route to a similar system."</em> - one of the office workers will not waste time standing in anticipation of an overloaded printer. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúIf print job is an e-mail, route to black &amp; white system.‚Äù</em> - even if the letters contain pictures in color, they rarely matter, saving a little toner is more useful. <br><br>  <em>"If print job has more than 30 pages, do not use desktop printer."</em> - The admin has a lot to do besides replacing empty cartridges on weak devices. <br><br>  <strong>KYOnet Policy Manager</strong> - control access to the device: <br><ul><li>  local or ActiveDirectory authentication; </li><li>  secure printing over SSL; </li><li>  secure storage with encryption and launching your print job using your ID card; </li><li>  device control at the level of permission to prohibit certain functions </li></ul><br> <a href="http://bit.ly/QAbBP1"><img title="04" src="http://bit.ly/QAbBP1" height="308" width="625"></a> <br><br>  The application is responsible for the security of your data, and you can talk about security for a long time.  I do not want to overload the article, so in a nutshell: <br><br>  You can determine who has the right to use the device and which features;  specify the method by which users will identify themselves, determine the behavior of the device in the event of unauthorized access attempts, and configure a secure storage system for tasks in an encrypted form. <br><br>  <strong>KYOcontrol or KYOcontrol Enterprise</strong> (the difference in names determines the scale of the company) - management of data output in conditions of increased confidentiality requirements.  The basis is the accepted assumption that the enterprise network is protected from unauthorized access, and therefore the document is safe until it is printed.  Actually, the goal is to eliminate information leakage from printed documents. <br><br> <a href="http://bit.ly/RKc1Dt"><img title="05" src="http://bit.ly/RKc1Dt" height="468" width="625"></a> <br><br>  The application allows you to implement the ‚ÄúFollow me printing‚Äù scheme: when you specify a document to print, the job is saved on the server in standby mode and will be printed only on the device about which the user is identified (for example, by ID-card). <br><br>  Here is a simple diagram: <br><br> <a href=""><img title="06" src="http://bit.ly/WI9Ncn" height="363" width="625"></a> <br><br>  In fact, you can make printing impossible without the physical presence of the user near the printer.  (Of course, loss or theft of cards cannot be excluded, but authentication options can be changed.) <br>  Perhaps, about the output can be finished. <br><br>  I really wanted to talk about applications as concisely and quickly as possible, but even in the ‚Äúgalloping across Europe‚Äù mode it stretched into three articles.  Therefore, in the following material, I will still try to approach the question as radically as possible and just make a table on Kyocera applications - with links and a brief description. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155383/</a></p>
