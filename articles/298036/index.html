And, without a doubt, you, as an experienced entrepreneur, are trying to work with all clients by means of email marketing, surveys and customer call-ups. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8e8/909/816/8e89098160286b839747cdc4ec846aa1.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      See what makes big brands such as Apple, Samsung, H &amp; M, Facebook and many others successful?  Every time they launch a new product or service on the market, they try to give their potential customers a chance to ‚Äútest‚Äù all the benefits from the product, talk to company representatives and get bonuses as the first customers.  For all this, they organize presentation evenings and conferences.  The time has come for you to reach your customers. <br><br>  In fact, it does not matter whether you are planning to just start your own business or have already organized a business, whether you work in the professional or entertainment spheres, you have few clients or many, you can start holding your events and presentation evenings for clients. <br><br>  Let's try to imagine what a cascade of events might look like, which will help to find new customers, build partnerships and increase company awareness in the city. <br><br>  <b>The first event.</b>  Identify a topic that might be interesting to your customers.  Look on the Internet on popular sites, what is now in trend and what causes the most questions from users.  Such pressing topics are more likely to attract visitors to your meeting. <br><br>  <b>The second event.</b>  Choose another popular topic and invite both new people and those who attended your previous event.  Offer them a discount on the purchase of your product or service. <br><br>  <b>The third event.</b>  Do a little research on possible partner companies in your city.  Try to organize a small conference / round table where everyone can ‚Äútake the floor‚Äù and share their experience. <br><br>  <b>The fourth event.</b>  Organize a larger-scale conference by inviting your new business partners from a previous event to act as speakers.  Offer them also give bonuses or discounts to conference visitors. <br><br>  <b>The fifth event.</b>  Spend a networking evening - an informal meeting where guests get to know each other.  Think of something fun, so that your customers do not feel "at ease", introduce them to each other. <br><br>  <b>The sixth event.</b>  From now on, you can conduct additional advertising campaigns on the Internet and social networks to attract new customers.  Show photos from previous meetings - this will give additional interest to users. <br><br>  <b>Seventh event.</b>  Having received a constant interest in your events, you can start selling tickets to recoup the cost of advertising. <br><br>  <b>Eighth event.</b>  Try to start inviting ‚Äúweighty‚Äù speakers to your meetings.  This may be top managers of banks or other large organizations.  Most likely, you will need to pay their time, so ticket sales are required. <br><br>  <b>Ninth event.</b>  You can begin to search for sponsors for their events, which will agree to take on some of the costs in exchange for advertising their products.  Do not hesitate to openly offer them to become sponsors, many will surprisingly agree. <br><br>  <b>Tenth event.</b>  Combine all your experience with events and all previous participants and organize something truly amazing.  You can invite local media and large companies (not only from your own city) to participate. <br><br>  Conducting regular events, you will notice how consumer attitudes towards your company will change.  They themselves will talk about you on social networks and recommend to friends. <br><br>  You can find out a little more about holding events from our previous articles: <br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/19734/">How can thematic events help your business?</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20214/">How to conduct professional events with business benefits?</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/onemarkt/blog/20434/">Customer Care: From Online to Offlan</a> <br><br>  Successful events! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298036/</a></p>
