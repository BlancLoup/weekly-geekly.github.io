For example, when you leave the apartment, you press the switch with the ‚ÄúTurn Off All‚Äù function, and you no longer worry about whether you forgot to pull the iron out of the socket.

      However, the most useful function of a smart home are monitoring systems.  Even while at work, on the road or on vacation, you can easily manage your home and everything that happens there.  It should be noted that such systems are used both to ensure human security and to ensure its comfort. <br><br>  Take, for example, air conditioning, heating and ventilation.  The cost of heating and cooling apartments every year are becoming more and more noticeable, and there is no doubt that devices that can help save on this will soon occupy their niche in the market.  For example, Nest is the brainchild of a company bought by Google, whose sales have already exceeded one million, as well as ecobee3 and Honeywell. <br><br>  Many of them are configured and controlled remotely using a smartphone, and also keep statistics on energy consumption, after studying which, you can figure out how to save more.  Moreover, such systems can differently heat different areas of the house, depending on where you spend most of the time. <br><br>  In fact, the user has at his disposal a climate control system, when air conditioners and heating systems work as one.  It is enough for him to set the desired temperature, and the complex will independently decide which sequence of actions to initiate. <br><br>  Solutions for personal security can also be different: this includes video surveillance of the adjacent territory, monitoring the integrity of the house, automated access control in the room, automatic coverage of the area during entry, and so on. <br><br>  All systems at home will take care of your peace and security, preventing unauthorized entry into your territory.  Smart home will take under control and emergency situations with engineering systems, for this there are also a number of technical solutions, for example, automatic blocking of valves in case of water and gas leaks, protection against short circuit in the power supply network, autonomous power supply, fire extinguishing system, etc. <br><br>  In the event of a leak of water or gas, the system will not only register this event and give an audible signal, but also automatically activate the blocking valves and also turn off the electricity in the danger zone. <br><br>  At any time, you can get a detailed report on the security system and the image from video cameras via the Internet, and if you want to intervene in the sequence of actions using an SMS message or a web interface. <br><br>  In this regard, it should be noted a powerful monitoring tool that offers SmartThings.  This is a Home Monitoring Kit, which acts as a virtual ears and eyes and is designed specifically to help people solve everyday problems without worrying about what is happening in the apartment. <br><br>  This kit includes various sensors, locks, cameras and many other devices.  For example, a door-opening sensor can monitor the condition of a garage door, front door, as well as windows.  Motion sensors constantly monitor various movements around the apartment, and smart sockets report on active household appliances. <br><br>  Alex Hawkinson, CEO of SmartThings, <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151016005845/en/Samsung-SmartThings-Home-Monitoring-Kit-Debuts-Serving">says</a> that by creating the Home Monitoring Kit, they wanted to make a powerful, integrated solution that was both flexible and customizable. <br><br>  It should be noted that monitoring systems are widely used in the hotel business.  The intelligent complex "smart room" also allows temperature control by automatically changing the mode of the air conditioning system and adjust the lighting, pushing and pushing the blinds in the apartments and controlling the lighting devices. <br><br>  Since we are now talking about hotel rooms, it is obvious that their service should be at the height.  Room monitoring systems can determine the need for cleaning the room and notify the staff at times when it is convenient for the guest.  Moreover, the client will also receive reports of such procedures - this should definitely help to increase safety and keep the tenant‚Äôs property intact. <br><br>  But monitoring systems also manifest themselves on a much larger scale.  Today, modern buildings are stuffed with many different engineering systems.  New residential complexes, as a rule, combine not only residential premises, but also retail space, parking spaces, etc. Every day, future tenants are placing increasing demands on the quality of housing and the level of general home services.  Therefore, developers and management companies use more and more complex and sophisticated engineering complexes. <br><br>  This again includes life support systems (climate control and power supply systems), security systems (video surveillance, access control systems, fire alarms, leakage control systems), telecommunications, automation and scheduling. <br><br>  The last point has become today an integral part of the housing sector.  Dispatching LCD allows not only to tie together all the components of the engineering infrastructure, but also to respond quickly to the occurrence of emergency situations. <br><br>  It is this feature that makes the building intellectual.  Automation connects all systems into a single self-managing complex.  Dispatching allows you to monitor ongoing processes in real time and promptly warn about accidents. <br><br>  Collecting data from individual and home-based metering devices and sensors for monitoring utility parameters allows real-time acquisition of information on resource consumption both in each individual apartment and in entire houses, which simplifies the process of invoicing residents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdd/964/edf/cdd964edf406445f8d8683e7fa2d58dc.jpeg" width="500"><br><br>  Each dwelling needs its own approach, be it a city apartment, a cottage in a guarded village, a house in a forest.  Very often, for different residential areas, individual scenarios are provided that are activated in certain situations, for example, in the case of the departure of the household.  Also, scenarios can take into account the time of day: for example, control of a country site will be active only at night. <br><br>  Thanks to the integration of systems, elements of the smart home are not only a means to increase comfort, but also to increase safety.  Combining traditional security systems with smart home control systems significantly expands the range of functions performed, giving a sense of calm and making user protection more efficient and reliable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394569/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394569/</a></p>
