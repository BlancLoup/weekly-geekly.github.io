  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Replacing the touch screen on the HTC Touch P3450 (HTC Elf)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  In September last year, he noticed on his elf a strange spot on the screen, as if from sweet coffee.  Wiping the screen, I saw that there was a puddle under the touch screen.  Attempts to shift it to the edge of the screen turned out to be half successful - visually the bubble was not visible, but it became clear from the sensor‚Äôs work that this did not help much.  The sensor worked exactly, then with a decent shift (I even suggested at first that it was not a hardware problem), by itself no calibrations helped me.  Hard reset discarded version of the software error. <br>  I did not grieve much, for I had long wanted to update my means of communication, and then I turned up such a reason. <br>  The problem was solved by buying HTC Diamond P4700, and the elf was moved to the box (it is still a pity to throw it out!)). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  About a month ago, I read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/80599/">an article</a> on Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/80599/">on replacing the touchscreen on the HTC Max 4G</a> and was inspired to reanimate the wheelbarrow) <br>  After looking at the prices for touchscreens in Russian online stores, I was upset at first, then decided to look at prices on ebay.com.  Seeing that the sensor for the ebee's wheelbarrow, taking into account the delivery costs only 250 rubles (against 1500-2000 in Russian stores), I finally decided that I would revive it :) <br>  Made the following order: <br><ul><li>  Actually the touchscreen itself with a set of tools for replacing it ~ 250r </li><li>  A set of 2 styluses ~ 60r (the native stylus has long lost its ‚Äúhead‚Äù, and in ION they are sold for 400r each) </li><li>  Silvery acrylic paint ~ 120r (the communicator's body in certain places was very torn, I decided to improve it) </li></ul><br>  Total: ~ 430r on the physical and aesthetic update of the device) <br><br><h4>  Actually, the process itself </h4><br>  A couple of days ago I received a long-awaited package from Hong Kong with a touchscreen and tools.  Parcels with stylus and paint came a week earlier, so after receiving the touchscreen, everything was ready for work :) <br>  The package itself and its contents: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://cool.elvista.ru/habr/elf_touchscreen/box_s.JPG" alt="image"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="http://cool.elvista.ru/habr/elf_touchscreen/common_s.JPG" alt="image"></a> <br>  Using the screwdriver that came with the tassrin, we unwind the device (only 4 screws, good-bye warranty!), Unplug the front panel of the device using a plastic piece with a flat tip, then go around the perimeter of the case, then pull out the screen cable from the connector on the PCB of the device. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://cool.elvista.ru/habr/elf_touchscreen/front_s.JPG" alt="image"></a> <br>  <b>Pay attention to the contacts of the front speaker (in the photo on the right), they are incredibly fragile and easily break off, as it happened in my case :(</b> <i>I had to order a new speaker on my own, it cost $ 6</i>

      Disconnect the touchscreen cable.  All the same plastic things disconnect the touchscreen from the front panel.  It is glued on the perimeter from the outside, you need to remove it carefully, so as not to damage the body and the cable, slipped through a small slot on the inside of the front panel. <br>  Dismantled "glass" with a touchscreen: <br> <a href=""><img src="http://cool.elvista.ru/habr/elf_touchscreen/oldglass_s.JPG" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  It is quite simple to glue a new screen to the old one; the old velcro perfectly grasps the new touchscreen without additional adhesives.  Gently insert the cable into the holder, glue a transparent gasket (removed from the old touchscreen) that presses the cable.  Carefully wipe the surface of the screen on both sides (it also does not hurt to wipe the LCD screen itself).  Insert the screen cable into the connector on the printed circuit board and gently connect the two parts of the case together, all 4 latches must converge. <br><br>  We are doing a test launch of the device and ... hurray, the operation was successful: <br> <a href=""><img src="http://cool.elvista.ru/habr/elf_touchscreen/boot_s.JPG" alt="image"></a> <br>  <i>With the exception of the dynamics, which I spoiled my carelessness.</i>  <i><s>Broken contact can be seen on the left side of the photo.</s></i>  <i>Hope that the broken contact was a duplicate and optional destroyed the test call: (</i> <br><br>  With the screen over, now let's do the painting) Everything is simple, so I didn‚Äôt take pictures of the process, I painted with a simple brush from the watercolor set.  I painted the side cap that covers the slots for SIM and microSD cards (it is peeled off first of all, and a layer of copper is visible under the peeling paint), and the ‚Äúmirror‚Äù near the camera.  The paint I had was matte, so the functionality of the ‚Äúmirror‚Äù was lost, nevertheless it lay down very well and became much better than it was before painting. <br>  Here is what happened as a result of painting: <br> <a href=""><img src="http://cool.elvista.ru/habr/elf_touchscreen/paint_s.JPG" alt="image"></a> <br>  After the paint dries, it is advisable to apply a second layer and put it to dry again. <br><br>  The task is completed - we have a phone of quite decent appearance and in <s>almost</s> full working capacity. <br><br>  Phone photos in the interior: <br> <a href=""><img src="http://cool.elvista.ru/habr/elf_touchscreen/interior_s.JPG" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  I hope that this topic will be useful to someone, or at least interesting ... and maybe even inspire creativity, as happened in my case)) Thank you for your attention :) <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  Many thanks to the user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/13alex/" class="user_link">13alex</a> for motivation in the form of a topic for replacing the touchscreen on Max, as well as to the user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/bukasa/" class="user_link">Bukasa</a> for publishing this topic. <br><br>  The topic was published at the request of its author <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/grcool/" class="user_link">grcool</a> , whose karma does not allow you to do it yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84768/</a></p>
