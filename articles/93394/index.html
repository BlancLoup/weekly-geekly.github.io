Therefore, we tried to prepare ourselves thoroughly for this resource. <br>  So, the announcement of what will be under the cut. <br><br>  The first thing that should be interesting is contests! <br>  Two design competitions.  Prizes: MacBook Air and a trip to England for 2 weeks.

      <br>
      The second thing that might interest you is the special offers that we have made, in preparation for entering the Habr.  Conferences, education, work abroad. <br><br>  Third - for the most persistent.  A story about what this Freeway campaign is for, and why we climbed into the full-blown education, tourism and everything else market for traveling abroad. <br><br>  <b>Go?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Contests </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>The best site design.</b>  It is necessary to invent and implement an interesting design for our site in layouts.  Deadline - June 30th.  <a href="http://fwstudy.ru/konkurs/">Details of the competition.</a> </li><li>  <b>Best t-shirt print design.</b>  This competition was conceived and held in conjunction with the site <a href="http://gozo.ru/">gozo.ru</a> , which many already know.  Deadline - July 31.  <a href="http://fwstudy.ru/konkurs/">Details of the competition.</a> </li></ul><br>  Welcome suggestions and suggestions on the date or format of competitions.  They are made primarily for you! <br><br><h4>  2. Our offers </h4><br>  I will not be verbose, otherwise this section will grow into a handout. <br><br>  Especially for you we were looking for interesting and relevant offers for work, training and conferences in the field of IT.  Google, DEFCON - familiar words?  If you yourself know in which country or company you want to work, we will find you a suitable offer.  There are suggestions for designers.  Web and not only. <br><br>  All the information you need can be found on our website, or call us =) <br>  It is probably convenient to start browsing with <a href="http://fwstudy.ru/it">offers in the field of IT</a> . <br><br>  If you have already planned your trip, but you still have some questions regarding visas / accommodation.  Call, write - we will help! <br><br><h4>  3. Freeway </h4><br>  The market for tourism and study abroad is very dense.  Especially in Moscow.  This is obvious, and therefore it makes no sense to be a regular travel agency.  Not interested.  Everything that we do - we help a person to accomplish what he himself could have done, if he had all the necessary knowledge and time. <br>  Many, for example, want to work abroad.  See how it is done "there."  Many people want to make some interesting trip, rather than another trip to Egypt or Turkey.  Not everyone has enough time or energy for it. <br><br>  It can be fixed. <br><br>  You can effortlessly and without spending a lot of time to plan your trip.  With the spread of the Internet, there is no need to run a travel agency.  With the same quality of service, there is no need to keep a large staff and to pay unnecessary stationery and office expenses.  Using the Internet allows us to significantly reduce your costs. <br><br>  The customer is our partner.  You yourself are interested in your trip, so you yourself make all the key decisions.  You have no money for a hotel?  Then maybe the hostel?  Or do you want to spend some time with a foreign family? <br>  Busy work schedule does not allow you to apply for a visa?  We will do it for you. <br><br>  However, for those who like to chat live, we also have an office.  Small, but cozy, with all sorts of interesting things inside.  What is the cost of an inverted world map? <br><br><h4>  4. Afterword </h4><br>  A lot of things I want to tell.  Obviously, this can not be placed in the framework of one post. <br>  We also deal with medical assistance abroad according to the same principles.  Is it interesting? <br>  Any questions you have are welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93394/</a></p>
