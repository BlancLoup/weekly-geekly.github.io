Advertising is beautiful, but it should be so) Another thing is the reflection of advertising in the mirror of harsh reality.  Let's see what the phone really is and see what makes it so big accent. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sjet.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Traffic</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Samsung Jet</b> ( <b>S8000</b> ) <a href="http://www.cyberstyle.ru/testlab/goods/view/655/Samsung_S8000_jet.html">is</a> the youngest brother in the new ambitious family of devices from South Korean craftsmen, however, the company seems to have the highest hopes for its own level of sales.

    <img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sjet2.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the main trump cards that the company promises in the new deck is speed.  Responsibility for this important parameter lies with the 800 MHz Qualcomm MSM6246 processor.  Of the assistants - decent amounts of RAM (1024MB) and ROM (2048MB). <br><br><h3>  Specifications </h3><br>  <b>Network:</b> GSM / EDGE (850/900/1800/1900 MHz) and UMTS / HSDPA / HSUPA (900/1900/2100 MHz) 7.2 Mbit / s; <br>  <b>Shell, OS:</b> Java, TouchWIZ 2.0 3D Interface with Widget System: <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Qualcomm MSM6246 800 MHz, RAM: 1 GB; <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 2 GB, microSDHC memory card slot (up to 32 GB); <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 3.1-inch touchscreen (resistive) AMOLED, resolution 480 √ó 800, 16 million colors; <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 5MPx with autofocus, LED flash, the function of eliminating blinking, face recognition and smile; <br>  <b>Communications:</b> Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 2.1, USB 2.0, GPS; <br>  <b>Sound:</b> MP3 / AAC / AAC + / eAAC + / WMA / RA; <br>  <b>Video:</b> DivX / XviD / H.263 / H.264 / WMV / MPEG4, AVI; <br>  <b>Other:</b> FM radio with RDS, accelerometer; <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 1080 mAh; <br>  <b>Dimensions and weight:</b> 108.9 √ó 53.5 √ó 11.9 mm, 100 g <br><br><h3>  Equipment </h3><br>  Having spent several bills with the image of the glorious city of Khabarovsk, you will find the following in the box received from the shopkeeper: <br>  - The Samsung Jet phone itself; <br>  - Lithium-ion battery (1080mAh, 3.7V, 4Wh); <br>  - USB cable and CD with software; <br>  - AC adapter; <br>  - Stereo headset; <br>  - Soft case. <br><br>  However, there are more sophisticated equipment (the so-called ‚ÄúGPS version‚Äù) - with a microSD card, a Bluetooth headset, an additional hard case, and also with mounting and charging for the car.  Nevertheless, even the top of the range does not strike with its power - somewhere all this has already been encountered ... oh yes, it seems in the DeLuxe-trim levels from HTC.  But in any case, thanks for the cover) <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sjet4.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The case of the device is entirely made of glossy plastic (not counting the surface of the screen of tempered glass), which as a result made it possible to achieve a small weight - 100 grams with the battery.  And this is at the size of 108.9 √ó 53.5 √ó 11.9 mm.  Once again I will scold manufacturers for gloss - it‚Äôs one thing when the device glitters beautifully on the shop counter (by the way, the cleaners from the shops, and with them many photographers, also throw a stone in your garden), another time when after the purchase all the time have to struggle to no avail with prints. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sjet3.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Almost the entire front side of the phone is occupied by a 3.1 ‚ÄùAMOLED screen (active matrix of organic LEDs) with a resolution of 480x800.  Without going into technical details and features of work, the advantages of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù display can be seen immediately after the display is turned on.  Excellent brightness and richness of the image, clarity and wide viewing angles - that is, in brief.  In the sun, the ‚Äúon-screen‚Äù situation has hardly changed - the device is ‚Äúblind‚Äù, like so many other devices. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sun3.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Immediately above the screen is the label of the company, and to the right of it is the camera's eye for video calls and the light sensor.  The latter allows you to adjust the brightness of the screen depending on the harsh external conditions, if this feature is activated in the settings.  He probably performs the function of a proximity sensor - if you bring the phone to your ear, the screen turns off (as in SLR cameras).  A little higher is the speaker, hidden behind a cute miniature grille. <br><br>  Under the screen there is a tinted hexagonal button that, when pressed briefly, opens the menu, and when held, allows you to switch between open applications.  To her left is a chrome analogue of the "green" tube, to the right - an analogue of the "red".  Everything. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sjet10.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the "belly", in principle, everything is standard.  Unless, the removable panel itself (the lid behind which the battery is located, the connector for the SIM card and the slot for the microSD / HC memory card) has an unusual texture on the outside - pseudo-volume red parallel lines shimmering in the light. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sjet9.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Such an artifact looks quite unusual and, admittedly, very beautiful.  At the bottom of the speaker is located at the top - 5-megapixel camera with autofocus and LED backlight.  The camera is framed with a chrome frame, which adds about a millimeter to the thickness of the device.  As for memory cards, hot-swappable cards up to 32 GB are supported. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sjet8.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Run over the ends.  Bottom - the ‚Äúpoint‚Äù of the microphone and the grooves ‚Äúunder the nail‚Äù to remove the back cover.  Above is a standard stereo jack (3.5 mm) for connecting headphones or a headset, as well as a microUSB connector hidden behind the cap.  Why it was impossible to use the usual miniUSB - a mystery to me ... After all, it is much more common and this posting can be easily found even in a person who is far from technology.  On the right side there are three buttons - turning off the screen (above), turning on the TouchWIZ 2.0 mode and the camera (the last two below). <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sjet7.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the top of the left end there are only two buttons in the form of "swing" - they are responsible for adjusting the volume.  Although ... if you hold this button, then a "false call" will be heard, which you can even answer - sometimes, there is a definite need for such a function. <br><br><h3>  Turn on and work </h3><br>  Starts a barrel organ holding the right "red" key.  It is worth noting the speed of the operating system loading - the phone comes to fully operational in about 15 seconds - very Jet'ovo! .. <br><br>  After the Jet-download, three desktops appear in front of us with advertising and juicy images as background images - switching between them is done by sliding your finger across the screen to the right or left.  At the very top is the taskbar, which displays a certain activity (signal level, BT, Wi-Fi, battery charge, time, mode, etc.), and at the bottom there are 4 buttons - a keyboard (dialing), contacts, messages and menus. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sjet6.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Each desktop stores its own settings and widgets.  The latter hang out all the time in a large company on the left side of the screen, on a special tape, which is removed by default.  More precisely, a small tab sticks out of it, which, when clicked, leaves the ribbon itself.  Scrolling up and down (surprisingly, but absolutely without brakes), choose what we need and drag it to the desktop.  You can change the contents (and sorting) of the ribbon of widgets through the settings, while placing only the most necessary or necessary ones at the moment on the desktop. <br><br>  Ribbon widgets implemented in modern Samsung models are almost the same.  In the basic configuration is available about 30 widgets, some of which require an Internet connection, while others can work autonomously.  Going into intimate details, these are analog and digital watches, dual watches, calendar, Exchange ActiveSync, photo, MySpace, Facebook, YouTube, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, three kinds of notes, profiles, help, Today, Google Pointer, Photobucket , Flickr, Picasa, Friendster, AccuWeather, Championat, Poster, currency converter, RBC News, Yandex.Probki, 5 most popular, birthday, go on a diet, quit smoking.  At the time of this writing, 18 additional gadgets were available for download, partly duplicating those available.  It is a pity, but there is no practical benefit from many of them initially;  strange that have not done such useful things as checking the balance with the output to the screen (hello, dciBalance). <br><br>  Any annoying widget can be removed by simply dragging it back onto the panel.  In principle, a handy thing and, in general, everything is fine, but not as flexible and functional as we would like. <br><br><h3>  Screen </h3><br>  The display of the phone really deserves the highest praise!  Similar devices (compared with what was at hand - iPhone, <a href="http://www.cyberstyle.ru/testlab/test/view/117">LG Arena</a> , LG KU990, HTC P3300) are far inferior in many ways - from image quality to image rendering speed.  However, in bright sunlight, all devices behave approximately equally - they ‚Äúfade‚Äù so that the device can be used only to the detriment of one‚Äôs own psyche.  So either enjoy 16 million flowers in the shade of a coconut palm, or we tan without being distracted) <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sun.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/iphone.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The interface is optimized for finger control, but you can also use the stylus (it is not provided in the kit).  Connoisseurs of the beautiful will appreciate the feedback when working with various menus - it is made in the form of light vibration, as in other new Korean giant phones.  So some actions can be done without taking the phone out of wide leg. <br><br>  Speaking of pants.  After some time (or after pressing the button on the right side), the phone locks up - to unlock it, you must press the button on the screen or draw the symbol specified in the settings (the most convenient is ‚ÄúL‚Äù, ‚ÄúO‚Äù and ‚ÄúC‚Äù).  So, it happened that the device in some incredible way unlocked itself, adding to the desktop the widgets it needed and, on the whole, doing wonders.  So, in order not to accidentally say a minute or two ‚Äúwith America‚Äù, keep this sensitivity in mind. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sun4.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When you turn the phone, it turns around and some of its contents - a movie, a browser, a player, etc. Chief, didn‚Äôt you have a strange sense of deja vu right now? <br><br><h3>  Speakers </h3><br>  The sound is good - when listening to music at maximum volume, the speaker does not wheeze;  at the same time, it is loud - the sounds of even the noisiest metropolis will not allow to miss a call.  If you close the opening of the speaker with your finger, the sound is almost inaudible - it is useful when the bell rings at the wrong time.  Although you can use a more elegant solution to the problem - if you put the phone on the table with a screen, then the sound and vibration will be turned off without changing the profile (conference mode or ‚ÄúI'm a little married now‚Äù - when you need to avoid unnecessary ringing of the phone).  If during a call, after pressing the green handset, to put the phone screen up, the speakerphone will automatically turn on.  Both settings can be disabled in the settings menu.  Miracles, and only. <br><br><h3>  Camera </h3><br>  The camera manufacturer also did not deprive attention - in this case, this is a five-megapixel camera with autofocus and LED backlight instead of a flash.  The photos are about one and a half to two megabytes, quite colorful and good in quality.  Even when moving, the camera produces clear images, sometimes, though with some distortion. <br><br>  There are six modes to choose from - single shot, smile detection, continuous, panorama, collage and frame.  Frames, as on all devices, are extremely poor;  collages still somehow competitive.  Qualitatively remove the "panorama" without a tripod is unlikely to succeed, however, it is better than nothing.  Exaggerating - leading dog breeders recommend using only the first two modes.  For them, there are 13 harvested installations - portrait, landscape, night, sports, party (indoors), beach / snow, sunset, sunrise, autumn colors, fireworks, text, twilight and lighting.  Admit it - did anyone ever use this when it was necessary to shoot something quickly ?! <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/1.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From the manual settings are available - timer (2, 5 and 10 seconds), resolution (2560x1920, 2048x1536, 1600x1200, 640x480, 2560x1536, 1600x960 and 800x480), white balance (auto, daylight, incandescent, fluorescent light, cloudy), effects (no, b / w, sepia and negative), flash (auto, on, off), ISO, exposure (matrix, center-weighted, spot metering), focus mode (autofocus, macro and face detection), image stabilization, WDR and definition blinking.  In addition to the photos, you can connect the record of coordinates, activate the grid on the screen, adjust the shutter sound and specify where to save the pictures.  Total - very good, but, in general, quite usual settings for camera phones. <br><br>  You can evaluate the quality of photos yourself: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Samsung_Jet_photo_02_s.jpg.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Photo in full size: <a href="">2560 √ó 1920 pixels, 1.82 MB</a> <br>  The remaining photos - see the end of the test. <br><br>  Also, the phone allows you to record videos.  There are 3 recording modes (normal, with limitation for MMS and slow motion) and 4 quality options (720x480, 640x480, 320x240 and 176x144), otherwise the settings are similar to the photo. <br><br>  The videos are quite sharp and smooth, the image does not slow down.  Download a couple of demo files (MP4) <a href="">here</a> and <a href="">here</a> . <br><br><h3>  Working hours </h3><br>  I always looked at devices with such a large screen with irony, following the stereotype that you don‚Äôt take a long screen with a large screen.  Not to say that Samsung Jet shattered this stereotype, however, the work time was very pleased - in standby mode about 5 days.  When using the same phone for its intended purpose (about an hour of talking per day, about 2-3 hours of music with the screen off and half an hour-hour surfing via Wi-Fi before going to bed), the time is about 2 days.  Full cycle of charging the phone - only 2 hours. <br><br><h3>  Software </h3><br>  Still with me?  ) Until I finally fell asleep, at a pace I‚Äôll tell you about the ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù of the device called <b>TouchWIZ 2.0</b> - after all, this feature has a separate button on the device body. <br><br>  By briefly pressing the button that is above the camera button, a three-dimensional cube appears on the screen of the phone, each face of which represents a function.  There are only six faces in a cube, so there are as many functions available - a photo album, music, video, radio, games and the Internet.  I remember the cube from the LG Arena, but only 4 sides were available there. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/3.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Sending pleasant vibro calls, the Jet cube rotates smoothly at the touch of a finger, occasionally trying to maintain a state of balance.  The function of each facet is duplicated by the icon below, so you can call the application from there.  There is one more way, the most inconvenient - from the desktop, hold the button for a long time on the right side of the case, after which the same cube will appear, but it can only be controlled using an accelerometer.  Turn the phone to the right - the cube turns to the right, to the left - to the left. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/41.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Calling, for example, the function of a photo, a stack of photos appears on the screen that are easily scrolled, if necessary, you can stop at any of them and see in full size.  When you select an audio player, a similar stack of track covers is first displayed with the name of the group and the song inside.  Next is the music. <br><br>  The music player is quite comfortable and functional.  You can download all the tracks, then sort by album, genre, artist or popularity.  Supported playlists, which can be compiled directly on the phone. <br><br>  When playing, there are three visualizations to choose from - something like jumping sticks (like on music centers), the same sticks, only vertical ones (oh, WinAMP, and you here?) And the most useful mode, when Cover is displayed, artist and song title. <br><br>  Virtualized sound is supported with headphones, a great advantage of which I did not notice.  If desired, any song can be set as a call melody, video call, contact, or signal.  Having brought to the desktop the player's widget, you can always be aware of what is currently playing and have at least some control over it.  The rest is the most common player. <br><br>  Since the favorable winds have brought to the fascinating world of the new firmware, I propose to consider the ‚Äúnew form of life‚Äù in more detail, without dwelling on the usual elements. <br><br>  Koreans have chosen an interesting way - for devices with different operating systems (whether it is Symbian, Windows Mobile or something different, like Jet) uses the same interface, but with different settings flexibility.  Accordingly, retiring from one device to another, especially not have to re-acquire. <br><br><h3>  Main menu </h3><br><br>  Three pages of elements (12 per page), switching between which occurs on the same principle as with the desktops - in a circle, one after another. <br><br>  How the interface works - you can look at the video or touch it in the <a href="http://omnia.samsungmobile.com/omnia2/">internet</a> . <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ozlm5uhE5ik%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhbwcSo9e7pK1trpkhL9IdpClqMjw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  PC Studio </h3><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/7.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The program is one whole complex, which can be called a "desktop".  We start, we connect the device (it will be immediately displayed in the program window) and then we choose what we will do.  The choice - the creation of contacts and their synchronization;  full work with messages (SMS, MMS) and device memory. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Music and video player, video conversion and recording discs.  Built-in organizer will help to put things in order, notes and planner.  Moreover, all these tools are divided into several categories, choosing any of which will open the desired "desktop" with the necessary tools;  You can also create your own ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù, with blackjack ... :) Everything has been done quite comfortably, and has never jammed it all the time it has been used. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/10.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When you connect your phone to a computer, in the window that appears, you can specify how to be - use the phone as an external drive or work with it through PC Studio. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/13.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/14.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Advantages and disadvantages </h3><br>  <u><b>pros</b></u> <br>  - High-quality assembly and stylish appearance; <br>  - Simplicity and ease of use;  widget system; <br>  - Long standby time; <br>  - High speed in all applications; <br>  - Bright and clear screen, loud speaker; <br>  - Functional G-sensor; <br>  - Nice feedback; <br>  ‚ÄúGood camera.‚Äù <br><br>  <u><b>Minuses</b></u> <br>  - Fully glossy case (solid prints); <br>  - Third-party applications are practically not supported; <br>  - Non-standard connector for PC connection; <br>  - ‚ÄúFading‚Äù of the screen in the sun; <br>  - High price (from 16,500 to 23,990 rubles). <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br><br>  The Samsung Jet phone is interesting not so much in terms of bells and whistles (of which there is not enough) as the courage of the new company‚Äôs decision to combine different operating systems with a single interface.  And if all sorts of shells for Windows Mobile (such as Mobile Shell or Touch Flo) are already beginning to develop immunity, the ‚Äúindependent‚Äù system from Jet still causes genuine interest.  In my opinion, a very successful attempt at writing - apparently, therefore, the company places such an emphasis on this particular model. <br><br>  If for a while to forget about the desire to customize even the smallest detail in the phone, then the device left extremely positive impressions.  In this case, I even understand the manufacturer - a full-fledged operating system, such as, at least, like Windows Mobile, many users unconsciously ‚Äúfear‚Äù, and somehow it is necessary to sell devices, and to the widest possible audience.  Therefore, IT has appeared - more functional than in ordinary phones, but less flexible than in communicators, an operating system that will be ‚Äúpulled‚Äù by a very wide target audience.  On the other hand, the same target audience, if desired, will be able to easily jump into more technologically complex devices without much habituation discomfort. <br><br>  And yet, I believe that the device is initially positioned for young people, and after it - for business.  Nevertheless, the device will suit both categories of users - for the first there are all necessary entertainment applications (games, camera, music, Internet), for the second - a full-fledged office work, of which PC Studio can be considered a tidbit.  And for all together - amazing screen image quality. <br><br>  In my opinion, today the price is somewhat overpriced (which is not surprising), and the near future spells a considerable variety of interesting devices not only in the line, but also from other manufacturers.  So, perhaps now is the situation in which it is worth the wait.
