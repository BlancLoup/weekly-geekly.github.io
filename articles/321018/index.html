    <h2>  How does crowd marketing work? </h2><br>  In fact, the goal of crowd marketing is the massive popularization of the desired object, through the formation of public opinion about it.  Marketers of the group generate and manage special tools: reviews, recommendations about the brand, service, resource, and so on.  The placement of the necessary information is very soft (only on thematic forums and other communities that were initially interested in the given topic).  The crowd-marketing technique does not involve the placement of direct hyperlinks (although this is also possible).  Campaigning is through the creation of motivation, mentioning the object of marketing and so on. <br><br><h3>  What are the objectives of a crowd marketer? </h3><br><ul><li>  Ensuring increased awareness of the product or service from the target audience, the development of loyal opinions of the society (community) </li><li>  Increase potential customer traffic </li><li>  Improving site factors such as behavioral </li><li>  Dilution of purchased traffic from links </li><li>  The fastest possible distribution of the necessary information on the maximum number of target groups. </li></ul><br><h3>  Crowd marketing reference system </h3><br>  It should be noted that often you have to dilute the purchase traffic from the links, as well as the search flow of customers with the help of special marketer skills. <br><br>  One of the important points in the promotion of the site is a large resource of reference mass.  Overtake ‚Äúresource‚Äù in a short time and will help crowd marketing.  It will help to generate high-quality, memorable search links.  In this way, spamming is reduced and the mass of high-quality content leading to the oncoming site increases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/197/887/ed9/197887ed995043a288dce7c577bbda16.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Great marketing tool </h2><br>  The most important task of modern marketing is the maximum popularization of the target object (company, brand, personality, etc.).  In the case of crowd-marketing, the popularity increases naturally: the number of references to the resource is increasing, its citation and other useful factors. <br><br>  However, this type of marketing is only suitable for certain sites that are suitable for such requirements as: <br><br><ul><li>  Subject - the relevance of the site audience and target audience should be maximized. </li><li>  Content - the same similarity is important as for the first item. </li><li>  Regionality - the more coincidences and the general of the object of marketing (the site for its sale, service), the better the result. </li></ul><br><h3>  Some Crowd Marketing Tips </h3><br>  So, with a low popularity of a company, brand, or product, crowd marketing can be safely used.  It will help correct the situation and attract the audience. <br><br>  But can everyone use crowd marketing?  The fact is that crowd marketing has several limitations as well as ways to increase popularity.  We will consider them in more detail. <br><br>  Even a large number of reviews, responses and comments may not help launch a chain reaction of popularization.  Consumers should engage in lively conversation, discussion.  Only then can it be said that the plan worked. <br><br>  A great example of running crowd marketing is a conversation about a new brand or product, created by PR specialists.  After that, well-written reviews begin to comment and other buyers / customers. <br><br>  In the case of the work of marketers with an already well-known company that has a certain reputation, you need to direct the conversations of users in the right direction. <br><br>  Also, the method of attracting the crowd will help to find the target audience by visiting various thematic sites, forums, social networks and so on. <br><br><h3>  Who should not use crowd marketing? </h3><br>  The effect can not be achieved if: <br><br><ol><li>  Your business has a narrow circle of consumers, in other words, a specific product or service.  For example, a marketer will not be able to find many sites for commenting on the implementation of shop windows or furniture for private collections. </li><li>  Business to business.  Simply put, manufacturers of any product or other b2b segment.  Crowd is unlikely to work for those who make machine tools or other complex mechanisms. </li><li>  Services that are used only for the occasion.  For example, making keys, repairing shoes or towing a broken car.  In order to find an artist, the client will not study the market for a long time. </li><li>  Everyday goods, that is, those that a person needs almost every day (bread, matches, and so on). </li><li>  Network marketing.  Crowd will not be able to promote the whole activity as such.  It is needed to ensure the popularity of something specific. </li><li>  Activities that violate existing legislation.  No one specialist will want to work with such a site. </li><li>  Resources that have outdated or frankly bad, inconvenient design.  You need to start with an attractive exterior wrapper, and only then promote the business itself. </li></ol><br>  The next step for successful crowd marketing is site selection.  For the greatest efficiency, you should choose thematic resources suitable for your occupation.  Resources with reviews, various forums and directories, blogs will suit. Which sites are most suitable?  Consider every detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63c/83c/b3d/63c83cb3d3424a388d46709554d7c8d6.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Types of crowd marketing sites </h2><br><h4>  Otzoviki sites </h4><br>  Resources strongly resemble the electronic version of the official books of complaints, as well as suggestions that can be found in each company, store, organization.  A large number of users are constantly looking for relevant information there. <br><br>  The most famous representatives of such sites can be found on the first page of the search engine.  Usually they do not have a specific subject, because absolutely everything is discussed.  But you can search for more focused otzoviki (for example, specifically about cosmetics, various entertainment establishments, tourism, and so on). <br><br>  Each resource will also have disadvantages.  There are several otzovikov: <br><br><ul><li>  Careful and long check of publications.  Moderation is a must.  With a negative decision of the moderator to miss your comment, the answer can not wait at all. </li><li>  Reviews should be placed from different IP addresses, since this factor is monitored and posts from identical addresses are simply deleted. </li></ul><br>  Some tips: <br><br><ul><li>  More details and informative - create comments of at least 1000 characters. </li><li>  Feedback should be as natural as possible.  Key phrases or defiant honesty (completely free, accident helped find a company, etc.) repel the public. </li><li>  In order not to invent from the head - take as a basis the real thanks or comments of your customers. </li></ul><br><h4>  Subject Forums </h4><br>  Forums are a treasure trove of interested users.  Here they share their problems, ask for advice and just find like-minded people.  That is why competent crowd-marketing will help to get a decent increase in traffic from these sites.  To quickly find the forum of the desired topic you need to type in the search for the most popular key and the phrase inurl: forum. <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br><br><ul><li>  At such sites, communication is dynamic and active - branches are constantly changing in popularity, and it is sometimes difficult to find a topic where there is a lively discussion. </li><li>  Advertising messages, or simply inappropriate comments will be quickly deleted. </li><li>  Society forums usually sharply and aggressively react to inaccuracies, mistakes or ignorance.  The reaction may be the opposite when making the slightest deviation. </li></ul><br>  What to do? <br><br><ul><li>  Find only active, constantly replenished posts forum - ideally, the last comment was left at least a month ago. </li><li>  To write a review, you should use a long-registered, active in all respects profile. </li><li>  If under your review there are questions or other comments, be sure to answer and support the conversation. </li><li>  You need to write only on the topic, without rhetoric and spam. </li></ul><br><h4>  Social networks </h4><br>  Large communities are always filled with a variety of information.  Here you can find everything. <br><br>  It's simple: we drive in the search for the right question and get similar comments, feedback and answers.  In such discussions, you need to leave information about yourself, your product or company. <br><br>  The second effective tool for working with social networks is a special program or an online service that selects the desired subject, city and key phrases.  This is called parsing.  One of the most famous services is called Lidskaner. <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br><br><ul><li>  The profile from which comments are sent should be real, not fake. </li><li>  In case of re-spam, you can get a ban from the group administrator or block your entire account. </li></ul><br>  Good to know: <br><br><ul><li>  Before you start advertising crowds in the social community with a new account, be sure to fill it with content.  Maximum page content with photos, videos, friends, subscribers, and so on. </li><li>  Try to avoid direct advertising. </li></ul><br><h4>  Question sites </h4><br>  Sites of answers and questions are excellent ground for crowd marketing.  Find them simply through the usual search.  The most popular at the moment are such resources as: Toaster, Mail-answers and others. <br><br>  It is better to start your post with a leading question.  For example, "What to choose ...", "What is better ...", "What is the opinion about ...". <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br><br><ul><li>  When placing links to third-party resources, they can be removed, leaving only the answer or question. </li><li>  Drawing up the correct suggestive topics.  It is often difficult to come up with a diverse question, is it easier to write ‚ÄúHow or where to buy?‚Äù. </li></ul><br>  Good to know: <br><br><ul><li>  Discussions need to provoke.  Add conflicting, but not negative information. </li><li>  For better implementation, you need not just to advertise, you need a life situation that could happen to everyone.  Such problems attract more people. </li><li>  For a good promotion with the help of question and answer services, you should have several active profiles. </li></ul><br><h4>  Various reference books </h4><br>  Do not forget about the collections of all companies, shops and other organizations.  In electronic form, you can not only find topics of interest, but also read reviews, or write them.  Mentioning your object is a great chance to get the desired result. <br><br>  Minuses: <br><br><ul><li>  To get your individual page in the directory, you must fill in the fields OGRN and specify your phone.  Later you can call to clarify some questions. </li><li>  Not all topics are listed in the directory. </li><li>  Messages can be moderated for a very long time - from one working week to a whole month. </li></ul><br>  How to act? <br><br><ul><li>  The more details in the application, the better and fewer problems in the future. </li><li>  It is better to immediately identify their advantages and undeniable advantages. </li><li>  Be sure to put links not only on your website, but also on pages in social networks. </li></ul><br><h4>  General Markets </h4><br>  There are resources that collect price lists of prices and names from sites, providing users with an excellent comparative picture of the prices of various products in their city and in various stores.  The most popular site is Yandex.Market. <br><br>  Convenience is in the first places of search results, as well as the ability to post detailed reviews.  Such sites will be especially beneficial, of course, for online stores of various goods. <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br><br><ul><li>  Commodity aggregators place high demands on selected organizations. </li><li>  Before registering you will have to fill in a huge amount of legal information. </li><li>  You can download your price list only in a specific format - YML. </li></ul><br>  How to increase efficiency? <br><br><ul><li>  Follow all the requirements and use the recommendations of the resource, as well as work out your price list from the technical side. </li><li>  When leaving reviews, be sure to use not one, but several IP addresses.  Otherwise, comments will simply not be added. </li></ul><br><h2>  Final Recommendations </h2><br>  Before you start posting, be sure to schedule your publications at selected sites.  Each review or comment should be written just for the selected site, and publications should not appear on the resources on the same day. <br><br>  In order to achieve good results and really increase the popularity of a brand or product, as well as to attract the target audience, crowd marketing needs to be done constantly.  To maintain a high reputation, public interest must be fueled regularly.  With a responsible approach, crowd marketing has amazing results. <br><br>  Material prepared: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/greebn9k/" class="user_link">greebn9k</a> (Sergey Gribnyak), <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/awedov/" class="user_link">awedov</a> (Evgeny Avedov), <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/silmarilion/" class="user_link">silmarilion</a> (Andrey Khakharev) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321018/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321018/</a></p>
