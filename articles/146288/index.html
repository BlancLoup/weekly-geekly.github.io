    <a name="habracut"></a>  Dear Opera developers ... <br><br><ul><li>  First, you chose the <b>length of the drop-down list</b> .  Designers for some reason decided that the 6 (!) Proposed URLs would be enough for everyone, and the long drop-down list terrifies all users.  You did not guess.  Entering more and more characters, occasionally poking over "show more" is not as convenient as selecting an item in the list.  Hello <i>Opera 12</i> - now even after clicking on "show more" the list opens only on half of the screen. <br><br></li><li>  Secondly, you have added page headers to the address bar.  I have little to do with them, I remember URLs, but the solution is logical.  However, at first the headlines were secondary (shown gray under the link), then the links became secondary.  Then <b>from the links left a pitiful bit of</b> "http: //example.com/pa ...".  In <i>Opera 12,</i> you thought better of it a little and decided to show the "most significant" pieces of links.  Significance of significance, but now the structure of the links is not visible.  Since these links are ‚Äúnot needed by anyone‚Äù (yes, the address bar is to enter the search words, yes?), Then you painted the links in a barely visible light-blue color.  Hello to all bespectacled brothers. <br><br></li><li>  Thirdly, you made a <b>‚Äúsmart‚Äù sort of offers</b> .  "Smart" in quotes - because the mind does not smell.  Links that I entered once a long time, many months ago, continue to emerge in the first lines.  Links that I enter ten times a day can easily be somewhere around the 30th item.  Previously, when I entered a link, the next time it was offered first.  It was stupid, but it worked.  Now manually entered links have no priorities.  Yes, I am a lover of canned food, I enter the links manually, and not google them every time.  What happened in <i>Opera 12</i> ?  Now, not only the sentences in the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù drop-down list, but also the sentence in the address bar (selected text that appears when you type).  Suddenly, blocked sites appeared in the offers (!), And according to the ‚Äúh‚Äù, it was not Habr that was offered, but http: // wifi /. <br><br></li><li>  Fourth, you <b>have added bookmarks to address bar suggestions</b> .  For once, a normal solution.  Normal - because in the settings I could disable sections that I do not need, and they were then displayed minimized.  Not perfect (I would hide it altogether), but you can live.  But here comes <i>Opera 12</i> ... and the setting mysteriously disappears.  Bookmarks are always shown, and in the first place, and our opinion does not interest you. <br><br></li><li>  Fifth, you have <b>complicated the entry of local addresses</b> like http: // homenetwork /.  If I enter homenetwork, I‚Äôll be thrown into Google and politely ask: ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you mean exactly what you entered?‚Äù As a developer with a HOSTS file crammed with a string, I express disapproval.  True, there is a workaround: after the name of the computer, enter "/".  Works, but not documented.  What is undocumented can be selected at any time.  Give me the opportunity to type in the address bar address, and in the search box - the search words (strange desire, right?).  What is <i>Opera 12</i> ?  Never mind.  What is interesting, the requests ‚Äúsite: example.com text‚Äù, as before, swears at an unsupported protocol.  When necessary, Google does not appear. <br><br></li><li>  Sixth, you decided that users are complete idiots, unworthy to see the full request in the address bar, so you <b>hide the protocol and request</b> by default <b>, and painted gray in display</b> .  The options "I'm not an idiot" you have not added.  Gray is so convenient and easy to read.  Hello hello to the bespectacled brothers. <br><br></li><li>  Seventh, you <b>added a word search from the middle of the link</b> .  Gorgeous idea.  But there is one thing: not a damn thing works.  If I enter "athari", I do not see a habrabra, a githaba, or hundreds of other resources that are in the history of visits.  I had thought that I had to go back to them, but that did not help either.  It just doesn't work. <br><br></li></ul>  Well, a few points from the past: <br><br><ul><li>  Somewhere in the 11 versions, the references in the sentences took on a percented-coded, unreadable form.  It can be seen with care about users visiting non-English-language sites. </li><li>  Somewhere in the 11 versions in the address bar there was a button "add to bookmarks", which crashed the browser.  But the drop-down button is very small and a couple of pixels from the detonator button - press it carefully. </li><li>  Somewhere in the 11 versions, the display of recently entered queries to search engines was removed, like ‚Äúg text‚Äù. </li></ul><br>  Results: for many versions of the address bar gets worse and worse.  When in the Opera's blog they announced that they had heard the people that they were making incredible efforts to correct the address bar, I was glad.  I was hoping to get better.  Did not become.  Corrected a couple of flagrant shortcomings, something stuck with tape, and then diluted with new shortcomings. <br><br>  And now briefly recall that ... <br><br><ul><li>  The main chip of Opera 12 was considered hardware acceleration, which was eventually zafilili and disabled; </li><li>  Most sites like poklast on the support of the Opera, and poklast still, including Google; </li><li>  Dragonfly frankly does not shine on the background of other browsers; </li><li>  Plug-ins have appeared, but are flawed in terms of capabilities; </li><li>  Opera is the only browser that requires clicking on the flash before use (NO, I'm not talking about downloading plug-ins on request, I'm talking about "Click to activate and use this element" because of the patent-troll); </li><li>  Opera is the only browser that cannot copy formatted text; </li><li>  Dragging tabs between windows does not work (via Alt + Tab); </li><li>  Saving images by Ctrl broke; </li><li>  More and more difficult to read gray (now in Ctrl + Tab) ... </li></ul><br>  Love is gone, wilted tomatoes.  Faith in bright times dried up. <br><br>  I‚Äôve gone to set up the Firefox 'constructor'.  We'll have to put dozens of add-ons to make it ‚Äúlike in Opera once,‚Äù we will have to rewrite personal user scripts and adapt user styles ... a lot of work.  But it needs to be done.  There is no other way. <br><br>  ... Or do you still believe? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146288/</a></p>
