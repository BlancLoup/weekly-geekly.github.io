Each application tries: a) to differ from others in some kind of function (Telegram, for example, is the security of correspondence, WhatsApp was originally distinguished by being tied to a phone number);  and b) as much as possible to create an ecosystem inside of you with everything you need - shops, taxis, payments, etc.  The best example here is Facebook Messenger, which in the past six months has received a dozen new features of this kind.  Messengers see that this is in demand (at least among investors) and grow in all directions. <br><br>  Many outsourcing developers at the word "messenger" clutching his head and with the words "no, not my brain" run off into the distance.  Why is that?  It seems that the market is already full and it is impossible to make something new that will appeal to both the customer and users.  Does this mean that there is no room left on the market for new messaging systems?  Not at all, and we, the ChaTeam team, will tell you in which area we are developing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d49/b44/c83/d49b44c83817414881bb586ffe2c3bc5.png" width="300"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87a/96e/de7/87a96ede7a594bd7bd29be64d1400137.png" width="300"><a name="habracut"></a>

      Speaking about the new generation of messengers and their multifunctionality, we completely forget about what they were created for.  On the communication of users and correspondence.  What is missing here? <br><br>  Suppose you are a lover of dwarf turtles from the island of Madagascar.  You go to the store for a new polish for the shell, and suddenly you have a question - what to choose.  How do you find active friends who are interested in them and quickly chat on the right topic?  You will say that there is the social group ‚ÄúDwarf turtles from Madagascar‚Äù on the social network.  All right, but social networking is a slow and very interactive process.  When you answer and answer at all, it is not clear.  You post, and always (and it does not depend on the size of the group and its subject matter) are not completely sure what reaction it will cause and whether it will be at all. <br><br>  This is where ChaTeam comes in - our new instant messenger.  ChaTeam is not only correspondence with friends and colleagues, but also an arbitrary number of specialized ‚Äúchannels‚Äù, chats on a specific subject.  All this in a mobile format and a convenient, already familiar form of the messenger. <br><br>  The speed of our life has increased significantly over the past few years, and the speed of our communication has increased.  Everyone understands this, starting with Facebook, constantly improving its news feed in an attempt to provide us with the most relevant and relevant content, and ending with mobile apps with their short sessions, within which you have to do everything you need, or conceived by the author. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãChaTeam is that the application provides this rate of information consumption and communication, but at the same time it is not the overcrowding of social networks, not the closeness of instant messengers.  This is a platform to search and communicate with interesting people on topics of interest to you. <br><br><blockquote>  One of the main tasks of ChaTeam is to find an audience for a lively conversation on the topic that interests you. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59d/057/186/59d057186ba44843bd6c6b9738b7c370.png" width="300"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a62/33c/419/a6233c4190bd4994ae94e0bbbf9273d6.png" width="300"><br><br>  During the search for new features, many messengers have forgotten how to search for friends and communicate.  ChaTeam we just created for quick interactive communication on any topic.  You can just search for the right topics.  Having found, connect to chat rooms, channels and chat, making friends and like-minded people.  If you do not find the desired topic, create your own channel and invite people to it.  All this with the speed to which all users of mobile devices have become accustomed, that is, on the go, quickly and simply, cross-platform, with a mobile interface, push notifications, geolocation and other pleasures of smartphones and tablets. <br><br>  What would a bug case look like in the ChaTeam "universe"? <br><br>  You get a smartphone in a store, find a public about turtles, see who is online, join a group, ask a question about polish and attach a photo of a store shelf with various choices.  Connected users receive a question (for example, with a push notification) and, by virtue of their competencies, answer it. <br><br>  Great?  But seriously, situations that require a quick search for a lively audience can be mass.  For example, on the exam, or on the road, when a traffic police representative stopped you, or when you are watching a movie at home and want to meet with film fans or an actor, or in a store, when you impulsively decide to buy a TV and do not know what to choose.  There are an infinite number of such channels on various topics; they can be closed and open, with or without photos.  In fact, ChaTeam is a mobile social network (sorry for another big name, but it is) in the instant messenger format - fast, interactive, friendly.  With a different rate of consumption and placement of information, but most importantly - for friends and on all topics that interest you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fb/d65/7d9/1fbd657d929649fc9b294bf73c752450.png" width="300"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5fc/2bf/ae5/5fc2bfae569a4524933a4e54587537da.png" width="300"><br><br>  Next time we'll talk about how we develop ChaTeam.
