Of course, the concept of ‚Äúgood / bad‚Äù in art is completely subjective, so I will clarify even more my question: do you like good fantastic TV shows?  I believe that the overwhelming majority of habrazhiteley will answer in the affirmative.  Today I would like to tell you about several TV shows that are worth seeing to every fan of fiction. <br><br><h4>  Glowworm </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c39/6e4/0ff/c396e40ff245082753a534426d750958.jpg">

      If you have not watched the classic adventure fantasy series, " <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2587%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%2528%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%2529">Firefly</a> ", then it's time to do it.  For 14 (formally - 15) episodes, we enjoyed the adventures of a team of space mercenary adventurers led by charming captain Reynolds, played by <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">Nathan Fillion</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f2/420/4a7/1f24204a7328eef2e4fa98bb78e69ad3.jpg"><br><br>  A very small budget did not allow the creators to turn around in the scenery and computer graphics.  However, "Firefly" immediately won the people's love thanks to its plot, inimitable humor and excellent acting game.  Each episode tells a new story from the life of the crew of the Serenity spacecraft.  What is worth, for example, absolutely enchanting series "Our Mrs. Reynolds"!  However, there was a cross-storyline. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54f/af4/c66/54faf4c66614a409b1e9a7afb0d23dc6.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps, ‚ÄúFirefly‚Äù has become one of the most undervalued projects on the part of the management of the FOX channel, on which the series was released during 2003.  "Firefly" was suddenly closed, and in the future the shooting did not resume, despite the protest of many fans.  In 2005, the full-length film ‚Äú <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25C2%25AB%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25C2%25BB">The Serenity Mission‚Äù</a> was shot, in which the main storyline of the series was completed darkly and tragically. <br><br>  Official trailer: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0O29rZiIRA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhwetVeL-Crkx_hUvXgYOsBgsE3xw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Black mirror </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d10/abc/bbf/d10abcbbfa8c402fbf94dff2e477fa9c.jpg"><br><br>  British cinema in our country is little known, let alone serials and even more so.  The <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D1%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE_%2528%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%2529">Black Mirror</a> , which consists of two seasons with three episodes in each, as a whole represents a rather gloomy point of view on the role of high technologies in the near future.  The series are not connected with each other; they are united only by one thing - an attempt to present the impact that high technologies will have on human society.  What brings us technological progress in addition to new opportunities in communication and the availability of all sorts of information? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8c/a95/1bd/c8ca951bd5d9cd59798449eafabd169e.jpg"><br><br>  British television series are markedly different from the US by some elusive thoroughness and restraint.  Not the plot, namely from the point of view of directing.  Unlike Hollywood with its rampage of special effects, fights and obligatory verbiage in the style of " <i>I have to do my duty, we are family / partners, I love you, you are my brother / friend / father, I have to save the world / country / kitten</i> ", the British concentrate on the very essence of the events, the inner drama and experiences of the characters. <br><br>  The official trailer, reflecting not the content of the series, but its, shall we say, the spirit: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ke5AKVtvkdc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiSpgyolcZBtaMYqYJ3G1fxCbxj4w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Almost human </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d86/5f2/afc/d865f2afc3c69bf690d9d849c52c743d.png"><br><br>  With piping hot, the freshly launched TV series ‚Äú <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA">Almost a Man</a> ‚Äù tells about a duet from a policeman and his android partner who looks and acts completely ... almost like a man.  At the beginning of the first series, it was casually mentioned ‚Äúabout uncontrolledly developing technological progress‚Äù, thanks to which it became possible to create such perfect robots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d9/08f/017/7d908f017f7f5f1a448317ed72ecc178.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, the creators hint at the technological singularity, but the world of the future (2048) is shown extremely unconvincing from the point of view of the explosive development of technology: no flight design ideas in such important things for the film atmosphere as gadgets, clothes, even cars.  Weak attempts to show the technology of the future on the example of weapons and tablets / monitors look even more pitiful against this background. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/27f/770/3ea/27f7703ea6ff195c40f467b9bcc1017b.jpg"><br><br>  The main focus of attention is precisely the ultra-realistic androids, which have very wide capabilities.  A special feature of the robot that got into the companions of the protagonist was its ability to ‚Äúexperience emotions‚Äù and ‚Äúempathize‚Äù, since this model (DRN) was created with the goal of being as close as possible to people in their behavior.  However, in the story, it was quickly discontinued and replaced by much more predictable and similar to the Android blockheads of the MX series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f1/934/4f1/7f19344f1d4a46c084fddcb9cbfed465.jpg"><br><br>  Darian, what is the name of this emotional android, often too as a person.  God bless him, with facial expressions, let's say that progress really allowed to create such a perfect imitation of muscles.  But when it comes to the manifestation of emotions and their influence on the behavior of the android, then, in my opinion, such similarity is no longer justified by the achievements of science and technology. <br><br>  While it is difficult to say how interesting the series will be by the end of its first season.  So far, he is a rather simple Hollywood hack, exploiting old topics about the relationship between people and robots, about the impact of robots on society, and about the grim and bleak future, as without it.  Although the writers are still quite able to correct the situation and turn ‚ÄúAlmost a Man‚Äù into a really good science fiction series. <br><br>  Official trailer: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykwxg534yAw&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjH0nzj5T5gLqMAZjnMpBCIPEbXXA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Jericho </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc6/5b9/ee4/fc65b9ee4451b19d64c4f57d84097746.jpg"><br><br>  The action of this <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25C8%25E5%25F0%25E8%25F5%25EE%25ED_%2528%25F2%25E5%25EB%25E5%25F1%25E5%25F0%25E8%25E0%25EB%2529">post-apocalyptic</a> series takes place in the small American town of Jericho.  It is located near Denver, in which terrorists detonate an atomic bomb.  A little later, it turns out that similar explosions occurred in several major US cities, including Washington.  As a result, the country left without the ruling elite splits into quasi-states.  However, this is only a distant background for the events taking place in Jericho, whose residents are faced with a shortage of food, fuel and aggression from the neighboring town.  In other words, the struggle for resources and survival begins. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/756/631/3cd/7566313cd26e5602478b3ae8ab14039c.jpg"><br><br>  In general, this is not so much a fantastic series as a psychological series.  However, he raised a very important question for modern humanity: what to do if a catastrophe occurred?  Let it be not an explosion of a bomb or a nuclear power plant, but, for example, an accident at a chemical plant or an earthquake.  Although in our cattle time it is very likely that the civil war version is modeled on Abkhazia, Chechnya, Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria and a number of similar madnesses.  What do those who are just trying to survive?  Very difficult question to which there are few answers in the series.  But this is becoming increasingly relevant in our time of troubles. <br><br><h4>  People of the future </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/322/7a7/97a/3227a797ad146da8e36892955285e3a6.jpg"><br><br>  Another of the latest Hollywood TV series.  In this case, we are talking about the emergence of "new" people who have various supernatural abilities: teleportation, telekinesis, telepathy, etc.  The creators did not rely on the technological development of mankind, but on the biological, and not in the ‚Äúfaster, higher, stronger‚Äù style, as you understand.  As usual, the company of the main characters begins to fight the "bad people", a state organization trying to gain control over all people with supernormal abilities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7b/802/0f5/b7b8020f56d24b16de0e9edf5293a137.jpg"><br><br>  The same theme was exploited by the ‚Äú <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D1%258E%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0">Alpha People</a> ‚Äù series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd5/0b7/c04/bd50b7c048059f97a38595c575f78ac1.jpg"><br><br>  "People Alpha" was closed after the second season.  Let's see how long the people of the future will hold on the air. <br><br><h4>  Continuum </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00a/d55/8f6/00ad558f6ed71eab3fced0246da0b8c9.jpg"><br><br>  Another Hollywood <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC_%2528%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%2529">science-action series</a> .  The plot unfolds around the police from the future, which has come to our time during the pursuit of the escaped criminal.  No doubt, a blue-eyed brown-haired woman with a good figure is really sexy, and this is one of the main advantages of ‚ÄúContinuum‚Äù.  However, the series is also interesting with various high-tech gadgets like police nano-suits (policemen?) And other devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96b/93f/0a2/96b93f0a22045174f046d4e7242e1abb.png"><br><br>  I talked about very different serials both in terms of plot and direction.
