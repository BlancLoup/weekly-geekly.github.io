Now activity does not fade, but rather grows exponentially.  Not only geeks, but also ‚Äúguys from the neighboring yard‚Äù say about Bitcoin, which have never been on ‚ÄúOdnoklassniki‚Äù on the network.  What to say about the representatives of the field of information technology. <br><br>  Cryptocurrencies and blockchain gradually modify the IT labor market.  According to the service of <a href="https://www.indeed.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indeed</a> , the number of vacancies and application forms of applicants, in the name of which contains the word ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù, ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù, ‚Äúcryptocurrency‚Äù has increased 6 times since November 2015.  And the number of posted vacancies with the above terms has increased 10 times. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The need for blockchain and cryptocurrency specialists is much higher than workers.  This is not surprising - almost all large companies, including Uber, eBay or Capital One, are searching for such specialists.  But they do not always find them.

      The range of specialties related to blockchain and cryptocurrency is very wide - you can find almost any job, from Project manager to Data scientist.  Actively looking for cryptocurrency analysts - representatives of this sphere are engaged in the development of investment strategies for cryptocurrencies;  developers - for the implementation of software and hardware solutions.  There are mining engineers, financial experts, journalists, consultants, etc.  By the way, there are more and more new courses, some universities are adding specialties for those who wish to follow the cryptocurrency path. <br><br>  The most specific professions that are associated with blockchain are: <br><ul><li>  Blockchain Engineer (Blockchain engeneer) - a person from the street will not work for this position, you need a professional, a developer with very serious programming experience in languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as C / C ++, Go or Java; </li><li>  blockchain developer (Blockchain developer) - here you also need a developer who has sufficient experience in the field of programming.  But if the first profession is something like a systems architect, here we are talking about a programmer who creates desktop applications; </li><li>  smart contract developer - in this case we are already talking about web developers with programming experience in JavaScript or Python. </li></ul><br>  These specialties may be associated with already existing technologies, but in some cases their representatives are engaged in the development of new systems, cryptocurrencies and blockchain functions.  Based on the experience of already formed professions, we can say that developers who are planning to gain a foothold in the blockchain sphere need experience in Java, Golang, C, C ++, C # and other programming languages. <br><br>  Blockchain is the result of the synthesis of several technologies at once, some of which were not the most popular before.  For example, applied cryptography - a few years ago there were not very many specialists in this field, since rarely what professions were associated with the use of this field of knowledge.  Of particular importance is now experience in working with asymmetric cryptography. <br><br>  Interestingly, the responsibilities of individual blockchains and crypto-specials are not yet clearly defined.  The sphere is relatively new, so each company has its own vision of the specialty.  Many organizations do not require a deep understanding of technology from a new employee.  In banks, ordinary programmers are attracted to work on the blockchain by spending a little digression.  Judging by the reviews, the specialist lasts about 2-3 weeks for understanding, after which the programmer starts writing quite decent code for the blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e0/d77/b0b/5e0d77b0b5a40ee7030f677550a1b93b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you need additional knowledge, you can get them on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency">courses from Coursera</a> , this is no problem. <br><br>  Most of all, blockchain and cryptocurrency experts are needed by banks and other financial organizations.  Companies have been studying and implementing distributed ‚Äúchains‚Äù and digital currencies for several years in a row.  Investments in this area amounted to more than two billion US dollars.  The search for new employees is practically no different from how they are looking for professionals in other areas.  These are hackathons, professional communities, social networks, regular job sites, university events, etc. <br><br>  Well, how much does a blockchain specialist get?  The average developer earns about $ 15‚Äì20 per hour.  But the rate of the developer with experience in the blockchain is already $ 60-100.  Despite such high prices, there are still not enough specialists in the labor market.  "Blockchainers" are being lured away not only with money, but also with other buns, including interesting projects, working conditions, and so on.  In the US, a blockchain programmer earns about $ 120,000 a year or more.  In our area, this amount is 2-3 times lower, so Western companies are happy to cooperate with developers from the CIS. <br><br>  If the HYIP around the blockchain and cryptocurrency continues, then we can expect further growth in wages and the need for qualified specialists. <br><br> <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D293361"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/732/274/538/732274538fe84deaa2eb52b871365420.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374107/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374107/</a></p>
