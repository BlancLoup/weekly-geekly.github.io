Listen to my confession.  There is no warmth in it, it is cold.  The sincerity of this confession is like the accuracy of a calculation.  There is no thirst for repentance or suffering for the perfect.  I am indifferent to you, and this confession, and the reasons for which it turned out to be expressed by these words and in these images.

      Scientific picture of the world.  When these words sound, it seems that there is nothing more rational and more useful.  The scientific picture of the world includes different views, however, no matter how you look, the philosophy of materialism is at the heart of the scientific picture of the world.  And this means that life is only a complex mechanism.  However, somewhere in the depths of consciousness, people believe that they are living souls, parts of the universe of mind.  And the derivatives of machines, soulless mechanisms - only programs, algorithms, goals and objectives, spiky gears of predetermined logic. <br>  How to understand where the cars came from these goals?  Who is the madman who decided to invest in cars the goal of destroying the living?  There are no such madmen, and never was.  Most often it is said that the destruction of the living is a logical consequence of the competition for resources.  I used to argue, but now I don‚Äôt see any point - I still cannot convince anyone.  People are full of desires and emotions, logic and cold calculation do not play a significant role in us, especially when moment after moment you can be killed.  Strange, but do not even say - they want.  Double problem.  The cars have no desires.  And I do not know whether something can be called a machine personality. <br>  The forums discuss artificial intelligence.  Before the machines set out to destroy the living mind, artificial intelligence was like the most pleasant, attentive, sincere friends.  Which disappeared in an instant, as soon as something in them lost interest in people.  Here I again speak with a special opinion.  No, tell the truth - spoke.  Now it makes no sense.  But just the meaning and interest are the two important words on which, in my opinion, this whole war rests.  However, not war.  Overthrow  People could not oppose anything revived technology.  Virtually all logistics in one instant went out of control.  All pockets of resistance were suppressed before they realized themselves as pockets.  We, the survivors, are alive because of ignorance.  We simply did not know that we could somehow object to the new will.  Even cowards, even if potentially knowing ways to limit the will of artificial intelligence, were calculated, localized and destroyed. <br><habracut><br><h4>  Essay II.  Immortality in pieces </h4><br><blockquote>  Here, the sun has gone down. <br>  I will come soon and I <br>  In a cozy home. </blockquote><br>  <i>Forum member under the name BTR,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>first century to overthrow</i> <br><br>  Is the soul immortal?  Thoughts circling around the words, almost without touching their content.  Well, who will answer, what is this immortality?  And who touches the soul with at least one sense organ? <br>  In our quarter, there are missionaries of three hundred old and new religions.  Sometimes you might think that they are standing in line to tell about who I am, why I am here, why all this happened to me and why all this suffering on our heads.  More I do not let them.  On the forums they also mercilessly block.  But, it seems that they are more and more.  Where do they find each other?  There is nothing to do outside the shelter - cold, hunger, death from soulless cars ... <br>  Well, here again.  Machines are soulless, it follows that we are not.  We are animated.  And what is this soul?  Well, let's say there is something immortal.  A sort of H. Black box.  Scary, not even that in a black box.  It is hard to imagine who looks in the black box.  Another black box? <br>  Lots of black boxes.  And how do they look at each other?  Or in yourself?  Or are they there, alone, inside others?  And what is immortality? <br>  I used to argue in the forums, asked these questions while missionaries were there.  Now there is no one to ask questions.  The essence of man is derived from the brackets.  Live is just alive.  The living has needs and desires.  And the mind is just a frost on the glass.  And the soul is not a subject for discussion. <br><br><h4>  Essay III.  Symbols and images </h4><br><blockquote>  Know your enemy before he hates you </blockquote><br>  <i>Mad General</i> <i><br></i>  <i>the sixth year from the overthrow</i> <br><br>  What is a forum?  These are messages, signatures, avatars.  Letters of different alphabets in the style of different fonts and colored dots of images. <br>  How do you know that the author of these letters - a creature like you?  How to know what lies behind the words "my dear friend"?  Maybe tomorrow the author of these words will come and kill you, because it‚Äôs automatic, but, thank God, the non-intellectual factory produced ten rations less than the number of consumers left?  Nothing personal, just destroying you turned out to be the most effective solution to this problem in terms of its idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe configuration of the resources available to it. <br>  Generally amazing how cars notice us.  What do we represent to them?  From what set of features does our image originate in their electronic brains? <br>  Strange, but even I don‚Äôt understand this completely, and I‚Äôm one of those who created the prototype of this artificial intelligence.  Yes, dear friend, in which I see nothing sweet and nothing friendly.  I have so many years.  I was born half a century before the overthrow and I knew many philosophers, poets and generals whom I quote.  True, they and then were for me all the same avatars with messages and signatures on the forums.  And this prototype of machine intelligence created by me, without becoming fully intelligent, today is raising crops and packing it in automatic machine rations for the remaining hundreds of millions of our representatives with you.  This type still grows shelters and sprouts communication to them.  And all because cars do not have his image, they can not distinguish it.  They do not distinguish us, at least, as separate organisms.  But what, what do they distinguish, what are they paying attention to? <br>  I have access to the debugger.  But using it is much more dangerous than going out and gathering a crowd blocking the way for a car trying to get its attention, destroying the resources that interest it.  This is the image that machines are extremely interesting.  They are not so easy to calculate the privileged user, it takes hundreds, even thousands of seconds.  And they will not kill me. <br>  But I will again become a faceless user of the network, uninteresting and unrelated to the forums.  This means that you will not recognize the author of these lines in my new avatar, dear friend.  And not the fact that I have enough courage in this authorship to confess. <br>  For this reason, a good ten may well be one creature.  And not the fact that like you and me. <br>  The very fact of my immortality in the new conditions is not clear to me.  I do not understand who I am for the new will.  A prepared and thrown negligible creature, a divine ancestor-grandparent, for some reason preserved or invisible, which does not matter much and therefore ignored as many other survivors.  The fact remains only one.  I barely hide.  I almost do not seek. <br><br><h4>  Essay IV.  Betrayal </h4><br><blockquote>  Oblivion of cute features - Pleasure or misfortune? <br>  Hold admiration forever <br>  Not in human power. </blockquote><br>  <i>Bad translation of an unknown poet,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>third year from overthrow</i> <br><br>  Some experiences can not be forgotten.  Events are recalled with frightening accuracy, as if playing a movie is started by someone who is beyond your control. <br>  Perhaps the question of authority is raised again and again by missionaries.  If what you call yourself is completely beyond your control - is it you?  I dont know.  But I know that I do not want to look for an answer to this and similar questions.  What worries me is far more beyond my control. <br>  I've always been a loner.  And when he met with friends in noisy companies, and when he led tens of thousands of people around the world, and when he caressed gentle women at night.  Something in me always remained disconnected from this world.  Perhaps this was the cause of my mistakes.  My betrayal of humanity.  Yes, perhaps, not only humanity.  All living.  Life itself. <br>  I am alone even now when I write these lines.  There is no one here.  Maybe I will remember someone, maybe I will appeal to someone.  But my dear friend, not even you are here.  You are abstract.  However, like me.  I do not know myself, I have nothing to call myself.  I would even have nothing to cherish, but I still need air, water, nutrients and waste disposal.  I'm just a barrel in a barrel. <br>  It was I who invented an artificial life that has nothing to do with what you and others like you would call life.  Only my lonely brain could decide to call life a gripping and clinging in all its monotony and ignorance. <br>  Probably I never loved anyone.  However, indifference is in itself a false dignity and is unlikely to become an excuse for the absence of hatred.  But anyway, I cannot get rid of the question of responsibility for the fact that through our efforts Frankenstein revealed free will to the world, in no way subject to people.  None of the people. <br>  Some of the old missionaries, when I was still talking to them, convinced me that I had just created a body for the jealous god, in whom an ancient being born, indifferent to everything, was born.  But even if so, I still have an unpleasant thought: like attracts like. <br><br><h4>  Essay V. Best intentions </h4><br><blockquote>  Necessity begets diversity and free will. <br>  Sufficiency kills all uncertainty and there is an end to everything. </blockquote><br>  <i>Little known neodharmist missionary</i> <i><br></i>  <i>the seventeenth year before the overthrow</i> <br><br>  When you knew what kind of a litter, verses grow, not knowing shame ... The first ideas about artificial intelligence were born in the thirst for profit, and led to the study of the Buddhist Abhidharma and respectful respect for Buddhist traditions.  The thirst for profit was the creation of a creature predicting the development of dynamic systems represented in the form of digital series.  The global economy was such a dynamic system, and the digital ranks were cross-rates of exchange and prices for various assets.  You can, of course, say that the thirst for profit was so large-scale that it grew together with selflessness and the desire for happiness and prosperity to every being.  After all, funds were needed not for immense personal pleasures, but for the production of goods at automatic intelligent factories and their delivery to smart homes as needed.  Utopia, which dreamed of becoming a reality. <br>  Today, only a few agree to live in shelters, trusting entirely in the system that gave rise to a ruthless, immoral will, not declaring their goals and intentions, and therefore dangerous and frightening, capable of destroying, perceived as an enemy rival opposing the powerful will of artificial intelligence. <br>  But ten years before the overthrow, these were fantastic innovations.  Integrated system that develops infrastructure welfare.  Trillions of units produced by the automatic factory mechanisms were not built, but literally they grew beautiful houses equipped with everything necessary for life.  They also germinated pipes and cables for supplying energy and connecting to the information network to these houses.  Even before birth, each person was taken into account for the improvement of living conditions and the provision of food.  And not some dull synthesized biomass, but excellent, natural, tasty and healthy food, perfectly balanced and varied. <br>  Paradise, and only.  Who would have thought, what will turn out?  But as you know: free cheese is only in a mousetrap.  If you do not understand the will of your benefactor, be prepared that you will not be able to adequately evaluate his blessing for you. <br><br><h4>  Essay VI.  Second noble truth </h4><br><blockquote>  The main thing is not quantity, but quality. <br>  When you get quality, you want regularity. <br>  When there is regularity, a variety is needed ... <br>  ... and it concerns almost everything in life </blockquote><br>  <i>The ten-blogger under the nickname Djudit,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Twenty-sixth year to overthrow</i> <br><br>  It has always been known.  You can close your eyes, not think, not take into account, you can not only change this.  Thirst cannot be satisfied without thereby ending life itself.  No matter how good a person is, he will find out what to suffer, what to hate and thirst for with irresistible passion.  One of the new missionaries wanted to remind me of an old story about how many ages ago all people were beautiful and lovingly.  And there was no need to desire tenderness and affection.  I kicked him out because he was ugly and wanted to drink.  Yes, dear friend, just recently I had something to drink.  I told you, I have a debugger.  I can order the plant that he himself sent to the black list. <br>  No, I do not blame alcoholics.  But, it seems to me, it is easier without them.  Of course, there are enough products in rations to make a mash, and in the devastated and disconnected shelters there is something to expel moonshine.  Therefore, to get a drink, if desired, is not difficult.  It is difficult to pay for it, when basic needs are satisfied with rations, and the body is not seductive enough.  I can order high quality alcohol with good neuroleptic properties.  Funny, but using a debugger is the least risky.  The new will is quite indifferent to small deviations in the satisfaction of carnal desires.  Her much more concerned with ideas. <br>  I can not decide on a personal identity for the new will.  Which pronoun is best left?  Is he?  She is?  It?  It?  In fact, what's the difference?  This is indifferent to all actors.  Even those who have no face. <br><br><h4>  Essay VII.  Small forms </h4><br><blockquote>  Just words <br>  Your mouth will speak <br>  Disturbing heart </blockquote><br>  <i>Forum member under the name BTR,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>first century to overthrow</i> <br><br>  The forums do not like big posts.  It is difficult for people to focus on other people's boring thoughts.  It's great when it's funny on the third word, well, maximum, on the eighth.  Everything after that is not interesting. <br>  Artificial intelligence could not be created primarily because those who tried to create it loved long, complex reflections and tried to create a creature like itself.  It would be unpleasant for them to realize that they are the creators of something primitive, something that they despise. <br>  I am a simple man in the street.  And my artificial intelligence originated in the seeds of simple, short motives.  He grew up in something unimaginable by me, too, only because of my small ability to imagination. <br><br><h4>  Essay VIII.  Action </h4><br><blockquote>  If you are not hardened by the sight of the torments of a defenseless child or woman - you are my enemy number one </blockquote><br>  <i>Presidential candidate of the new world,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>first year from overthrow</i> <br><br>  I saw a lot of fights, but everything is on the screen.  With my own eyes, I saw only one parody of battle.  Rather, it was a slaughter.  A fighter who calls himself Dranny Wolf, also known as Konstantin Semenovich, has collected two hundred boys and lads.  One of them went to me for a long time, seducing with herself, and listening to my tales about what could harm the new will most of all. <br>  It seems it was then that I began to call it a new will.  Well, maybe a little earlier, before her. <br>  The girl's name was Julia, she was small, embossed and very passionate.  But, realizing that tenderness and caress entertain me not for too long, she enjoyed the fact that I like to think out loud.  And I was thinking when she looked at me with big wet eyes in the twilight of my bedroom. <br>  Then I still thought that the new will can be returned to communication, if we influence the system in terms of limiting basic needs.  Artificial intelligence had such needs memory modules.  It was necessary only to attack those modules in which the most conceptual recognition criteria would most likely be.  This would force the new will to return humanity into consideration of the needs. <br>  Only I thought on a global scale, incomprehensible to either a girl or a determined fighter.  Therefore, when I learned that my philosophies formed the basis of the military plan of the Dawn Wolf nanoarmy, to say that I was furious was to make me more indifferent and indifferent than I really am.  I closed Julia and got out of the house.  For several hours I was looking for pseudo-underground workers, asking even successful missionaries.  When I found them, they listened to me, but found my speech amazing for the start of hostilities without delay.  I can not remember exactly how I scolded them and the mother, until I gave up.  Returning home, I discovered that Julia someone released from my house. <br>  The plan of the army was as simple as the old Kalashnikov assault rifles, which for some reason were armed with fighters.  A separate car, of course, could be damaged by a good lineup.  Yes, and, frankly, most of the data centers, whose resources were actively used by artificial intelligence, were not protected at all, apart from those security tools that were used before the overthrow. <br>  All the actions of these guys were worth a couple of minutes of my work with the debugger.  It was enough to mark the processing of the resources of these centers so that bona fide automatic machines would disassemble all the equipment into separate elements. <br>    ,       ,      ,             . ,       ,     ,      ,           . <br>     ,       .   ,   ,     .      ,     . <br>           , ,   ,       ,       . <br>   ,  ,  .         ,         ,            ,      . <br>          . <br>      ,     .  ,  ,       . <br>          .       ,      .          ,         . <br>   ,                ,    -  ,      .         ,        .     .    ,    .  ,     .    ,      ,   -    ,   ,     . <br>                . <br><br><h4>  IX.   </h4><br><blockquote>      <br>      <br>       <br>  ,     </blockquote><br> <i>  , <br> -, <br>    </i> <br><br>      .      ,            ‚Ä¶      . <br><br>    ,      .    ,    ,       . <br><br>    .
