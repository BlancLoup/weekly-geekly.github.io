There are seven of them. <br><br>  1) I despise advertising.  No ads in your product. <br>  2) I do not notice the publishers.  No communication with publishers. <br>  3) I play only intellectual games.  No pop apps. <br>  4) I do not like beggars.  No requests to users inside the author's programs. <br>  5) I am above the press.  No paid reviews or purchase interviews. <br>  6) Not a line of someone else's code.  I am the greatest magician. <br>  7) And finally, do not steal, crud, music and pictures. <br><br>  Of course, in six months of development, I committed all 7 deadly sins. <br><br>  The author is a scoundrel !, exclaim you, and you will be right. <br>  But not a scoundrel.  Scoundrel - who does nasty things with pleasure. <br><br><h4>  Sin is the first.  Advertising </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cd/117/fc7/5cd117fc7910f9c25bb2a2081180e6fc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Advertising has been tested in five or six games. <br>  I placed it only in the backyard of applications, somewhere on UIWebView and only for residents of the United States of America. <br><br>  After the release of advertising applications, I looked at the daily reports on advertising revenue in surprise and stupidly - a lot of numbers.  Many abbreviations like "Impressions on click".  It looks beautiful, but useless.  Statistics update time is not amenable to analysis.  Poked into advertising reports for a week, completely lost interest in this page. <br><br>  Final earnings - $ 10-15 per month.  The maximum daily earnings of $ 3.  He jumps about every seven to ten days.  But the standard daily profit is from 1 to 10 cents. <br>  Having slept with advertising, I no longer sin with it. <br>  But $ 12 for April I will drink with pleasure. <br><br><h4>  Sin of the second.  Publishers </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed3/a34/30a/ed3a3430a7360bdfa6df3ed051c61de4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://appannie.com/">414,000 applications in the appStore</a> .  How can a poor peasant be heard amid such wealth? <br>  Having read article on Habr√© about publishers, sinned and sent out 5 letters on the first five google-publishing links. <br><br>  Of 5 publishers, only one responded instantly and immediately.  Somebody Ed from some Chilingi. <br>  Wonderful man.  In the signature, he keeps IMEA 3 of their i-devices.  I included them in the developer profile and sent him about 5 of my handicrafts. <br>  Politely praising a couple of applications, he <s>sent me the fuck</s> rejected all 5 for various reasons. <br>  From <i>We do not work with already published applications</i> and until <i>It will not have commercial success</i> . <br>  Among other things, he gave a bunch of correct tips on the design and layout of the buttons, to the availability of hints and translation quality.  Thanks, Ed. <br>  So that I get rid of him, Ed promised to buy a couple of my new games.  He fulfilled the promise, and I brutally set a price of $ 3 for my free apps on the day of his purchase. <br>  Forgive me Ed and goodbye. <br>  Your 6.5 pounds sterling I will drink in the best English pub of Mordovia. <br><br><h4>  Third sin  Pops </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/635/c30/dc2/635c30dc22ff564063b3668c81102c21.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Smart games swing smart people.  They are smarter and smarter than me.  They do not buy bones and preference, they are waiting for a desperate author to declare them free. <br>  The download statistics for these applications are sad. <br><br>  In the status of paid - 20-50 races per year. <br>  In the status of free - 2000 - 10,000 per year. <br><br>  Despite the lack of financial success, I feel immensely, like the Sun, moral satisfaction - 500 people from 60 (already 80) countries of the world compete in author's toys every day. <br>  I like <s>when you go naked around the apartment to</s> re-read the names of their iPhones and respectfully convey to them the warm greetings from Russia. <br><br>  But the money (10 races a day) I still drip. <br>  They're not dripping from smart games, but from randomly crafted pop apps.  I have two of them.  The boy and ... also the boy. <br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/potters-wheel/id409997892%3Fmt%3D8">Potter</a> and ... also <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id436767888">Barber</a> . <br><br>  I made them very quickly, I do not play myself, I was pleasantly surprised by the number of downloads. <br>  In my opinion, they are chosen by 10-14 year old girls and boys.  And the whole article is colored with hairstyles made by these young creatures.  A collection of their hairdressing can be seen in the <a href="http://iphone.bashni.org/barber">hair salon</a> . <br><br><h4>  Fourth Sin  Begging </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/306/fa9/c82/306fa9c829da8fa2f4aa1e8406de47dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Ban Ax pretended not to hear the comments, and asked:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Isn't it a shame to you, pop, to collect alms?</i>  <i>Begging is a grave sin.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Brother Macarius laughed, and in his eyes merry sparks ran.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúHow, your grace, begging can be a sin if mercy is a virtue?‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  (c) <a href="http://bookz.ru/authors/tadeu6-kvatkovskii/sem_-sme_740/page-2-sem_-sme_740.html">Tadeush Kvyatkovsky</a> <br><br>  The first and only application of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/china-towers/id434354745%3Fmt%3D8">Tower of China</a> , where I ask the user to purchase functionality.  It brings 200 free races per day and 3-5-7 daily purchases from the app.  In comparison with the same paid application, the income increases exactly by an order! <br>  Waiting for the New Year 1000 dollars from the Chinese Towers. <br>  Thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/epazzz/" class="user_link">epazzz</a> for the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/macosxdev/84359/">wonderful article</a> that pushed me to the coding mechanism of purchasing in app - it took half a day of unhurried work for the first application and 15 minutes for all subsequent ones. <br>  Attention!  Do not forget to click the Ready for Review button for purchase in the app bundle in the appStore.  I forgot - and lost two weeks to check.  This bundle is checked for as long as the application itself. <br><br>  2 weeks ago I posted a new casual game Cli Cli (live Dirichlet cells) in appstore.  The application contains the mechanism of a beggar inside me and I look forward to the results.  Even Chinese success.  No need to laugh!  1000 bucks a year from an application is a success.  Do not believe in millions of fairy tales. <br><br>  By the way, I check the overwhelming idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa dream.  If the game is dreaming, then this is a potential hit.  Cli Cli I dream.  Like the Tower three years ago. <br><br><h4>  Sin is the fifth.  Fifth power </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33f/81b/c77/33f81bc77d3691b51364b65a5a678c67.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Reviews.  Journalists.  Press.  All the elections! <br>  I sent it to two resources - <a href="http://www.iguides.ru/">Russian (on a tip from a habrauzer)</a> and <a href="http://www.youapp.cn/">Chinese (at their request)</a> 10 promotional codes of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id436767888">Barber</a> application. <br>  I did not see any reviews. <br>  No reply to emails. <br>  But he suffered a lot - in the week the application bought 50 people.  +20 promo codes.  + 10 friends.  total should not be more than 100 users. <br><br>  And there are more than 3000 of them (I secretly spy on users through NSURLRequest).  What the fuck am I sorry ?? <br>  And who is to blame, Russian or Chinese, who is so cunning ?? <br><br><h4>  Sin of the sixth.  Someone else's code </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e28/78c/3a2/e2878c3a28bda96cef47fe99e0d8b3f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thoughtless use of other people's libraries and examples leads to errors for which you will have to answer. <br>  As a result, I use only native iOS frameworks - OpenGLES for 3D graphics, AVFoundation for background melodies and QuarzCore for animation effects, and carefully shovel examples from StackOverflow. <br>  But the first applications, the same <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id400694692">King</a> , still keep the mistakes of others examples. <br>  Nevertheless, the skill of coding under iOS is growing evolutionarily.  I do an iteration.  I post new versions of old applications in the appStore.  I do not hesitate, as a schoolboy to solve on Obj-C programming tasks, set for other languages.  For example <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/programming/120665/">yeti</a> .  Helps a lot. <br><br><h4>  The seventh sin.  Don't steal </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/607/635/a3d/607635a3dff4eeee2e35377522e6069c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thank God, there are a lot of free music and free images on the net.  And if they are copyrighted, then the e-mail of the author sometimes lives nearby, which is almost always ready to give you a 100% discount or get a promotional code.  If the author is not found, then help programs-editors that turn other people's pixels into native ones. <br><br>  It‚Äôs a sin, of course, to snatch other people's pictures, but agree that the original image of 1024 by 768 pixels scaled to 57 by 57 pixels is already not quite original. <br><br><h4>  so </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbb/245/71e/bbb24571e08e19ad3bad2ae1ce0f20d8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Following the results of half a year, I threw about 30 versions of 15 different applications onto the market and reached the level of income of 300 ye per month. <br><br><h6>  Cons of the extensive approach </h6>  The process of creativity begins to get. <br>  You do not have time to introduce new solutions and improvements to the old application. <br>  The main work begins to suffer. <br><br><h6>  pros </h6>  Growing experience. <br>  Growing profit. <br>  You can move into the category of teachers - you are no longer at the bottom of the pyramid built by Steve Jobs. <br><br>  As a teacher, I will tell you about one scam trick.  Tested on the application <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id426342975">fortune teller</a> .  A typical situation is that a paid application is not purchased, but it is actively downloaded after being declared free.  Apply the following trick.  At 12-00 MSK, when in Kalifoniya one o'clock at night, we declare it free.  In the evening at 20-00 MSK we close the shop.  For 8 hours, it is managed to download a hundred or two users, somewhere in the ratings it takes off and 2-5 people buy the app by inertia. <br>  Applied this trick 5 times from boredom or cunning - it always worked. <br><br>  I apologize to the developers for fiction, the complete lack of code and useful examples. <br><br>  Just a mood like a joke. <br><br>  -Why are you so sad? <br>  I don‚Äôt know - I don‚Äôt want to work the third day. <br>  - So Wednesday! <br><br><h4>  Bibliography </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/740/f40/2e0/740f402e02cd0eb17694f2f4fd6b2341.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The article used hairstyles made by girls with the help of the application <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id436767888">Barber</a> . <br>  As a model used the face of a famous Hollywood star. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120075/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120075/</a></p>
