Good day. <br><br>  I bring to light my idea which I think will seem futuristic and utopian to many, but still very interesting and useful. <br><br>  Main idea.  Mobile devices of one operator, which are located each other at a distance of a Wi-Fi signal, could be combined into a P2P network to route traffic between each other.  What are the benefits?  Please tackle. <a name="habracut"></a>  : 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      What are the advantages: <br><br>  - A device with different signal levels within a building will be able to redirect traffic through the fastest connection. <br>  - The operator will be able to configure the P2P pool so that, if possible, stop using 3G traffic in favor of 4G. <br>  - If one of the participants has access to the Internet via Wi-Fi connection, then the traffic can be redirected through it.  Naturally, if this member allows such access. <br>  - You can implement a multi-channel connection, which will positively affect the connection speed and its stability. <br><br>  Some moments. <br><br>  - The client establishes a connection with the provider server.  From the server receives an encryption key between the client and the server, for packets that can go through the P2P network. <br>  - The phone creates a virtual Wi-Fi interface.  Each of the clients verifies the authenticity of its neighbor at the server and, if the check is passed, adds the neighbor to the list of nodes. <br>  - Each client independently periodically assesses the quality of the connection using ping parameters and speed.  He provides this information to his neighbors upon request. <br>  - The user can configure his client to provide the Wi-Fi network available to him for marshaling the traffic of the P2P pool of the network through other networks.  And maybe even set up to provide access through the second sim card.  For example, if the signal level in a given location is lost by this provider. <br>  - All other things being equal, the P2P network may give preference to transmitting traffic to that network node that is charging. <br><br>  Why this may interest providers. <br><br>  - This will improve the quality of services without large infrastructure costs.  Actual costs: developing client software and hosting a VPN or proxy server depending on the implementation. <br>  - A feature of the client software is that it will monitor the Wi-Fi connection and, if desired, identify users who modify devices for distributing the Internet to unwanted devices for the provider.  And for example, such clients will be denied connection to the P2P network, thereby motivating them to refuse such modifications. <br>  - The provider can attract customers by providing access to the Internet through P2P networks, such as promotional codes or vouchers. <br>  - Unallocated P2P data can be generated in BIG DATA and sold. <br><br>  Perhaps I am mistaken, but the world practice in building access networks is building a network from the center to the periphery, which is logical.  And often the last mile becomes the weak link.  But there were no attempts to start building a network from the user to the center.  This opens up new possibilities.  In fact, the one who implements this will be the pioneer in the field of virtualization of the last mile.  Previously, it was simply impossible, but now all the necessary technologies have already appeared. <br><br>  This idea was inspired by the YOTA operator and the automatic switching function of networks in the Samsung phone. <br><br>  I hope the idea will help make the world a better place. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322896/</a></p>
