  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We open statistics on the sources of views and responses on ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Methods and approaches used in marketing over the past decade, in recent years are actively borrowed in the field of Eychara.  One of these techniques is working with a sales funnel.  When the client's path to the purchase is divided into several stages, and at each stage it is checked what percentage of customers moved to this stage from the previous one.  In Euchar, such a funnel is built on the process of attracting candidates for a company vacancy.  The ‚Äúclient‚Äù is the candidate, and the ‚Äúproduct‚Äù is the vacancy. <br><br>  Many clients of My Circle began to apply marketing techniques in their work.  They carry out advertising campaigns for their vacancies, work with candidates on a funnel in specialized CRM systems.  And sometimes it is difficult for them to evaluate the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns, since there is no way to understand where the applicant, who left a response and then came to the company, learned about the vacancy. <br><br>  We decided to help our employers and today we are happy to show our new system for collecting statistics on the sources of views and responses to vacancies on <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">My Circle</a> .  We also learned how to track the path of the applicant until the response, by which one can understand what information channels he came into contact with before deciding to respond.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fm/ho/dx/fmhodxyt_wegrr900wqbokfqubo.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When we work with candidates' funnel, acquaintance of a ‚Äúclient‚Äù with a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù begins with advertising a vacancy, then a part of those who see the advertisement goes to the ‚Äúproduct‚Äù page for studying a vacancy, then some of them make a ‚Äúpurchase decision‚Äù, leaving their response to the vacancy .  At this funnel does not end, then go interviews, an invitation to work and, at the very end, the passage of the probationary period. <br><br>  My Circle works in the first three stages of such a funnel.  Even if the employer himself does not conduct advertising campaigns of his vacancies, we do it anyway, promoting vacancies on the services of our habr-family (habrahabr.ru, geektimes.ru, toster.ru, freelansim.ru, moikrug.ru, tmfeed.ru ), as well as in our social networks, telegram channels and mailings.  With the help of new statistics, you can understand what percentage of the candidates who saw the advertising message went to your vacancy, and then what percentage of the candidates left their response.  Playing various forms of presenting vacancies and advertising places, you can find the most effective advertising messages and channels. <br><br><h3>  Sources of views and responses </h3><br>  To view the sources of views and responses to the vacancy in general, you need to click on the ‚ÄúStatistics‚Äù link located in the vacancy header.  There are two reports on the page: sources of views and sources of responses. <br><br>  Sources of views can be viewed by period of placement of vacancies on the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/152/4fe/a83/1524fea83b980fcebdb778f8114209fb.png"><br><br>  Sources of feedback can be viewed only for the duration of the vacancy.  The sources of responses are understood as the last source by which the user came to the site and left a response. <br><br>  We began to consider statistics of sources of responses from March 7, 2018.  Accordingly, the responses left earlier have no such story, there is <b>unknown</b> in their sources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c48/6c9/dcd/c486c9dcd20c11c9f50a80e04001e3b1.png"><br><br><h3>  Candidate's Path to Response </h3><br>  On the main page of the vacancy under each response there is a button "Sources", when you click on it, a block opens with the path of the candidate to the response.  On the way it is shown how many times the candidate went to the website of ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù and from what sources, before leaving this response. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c4/4d9/411/8c44d941120354440e299c9d28d8be16.png"><br><br>  This particular path of the applicant means that the candidate went to ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù 5 times directly by entering the website address in the browser (direct), then followed the link from github.com, and finally came from habrahabr.ru (from the vacancy block on page of a separate post) and left your response.  We keep the path that the candidate has completed over the past three months. <br><br>  In addition to the source itself, a campaign can be indicated in parentheses, for example: habrahabr.ru (vacancies_post), as in the example above.  This means that a special parameter <b>utm_campaign</b> was specified in the link that the user <b>followed</b> , for example utm_campaign = vacancies_post. <br><br>  If you advertise your jobs posted on ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù, giving links to them on other sites, do not forget to add this wonderful parameter to the link.  It will definitely appear in the sources of views and responses, and you will understand how well your advertising campaign works. <br><br>  For a detailed explanation of all possible sources, see the <a href="https://moikrug.ru/info/analytics">help article</a> . <br><br><hr><br>  By the way, if you are ready to test our new statistics by the end of April, that is, we are ready to place a link to a vacancy in any of our channels, adding the parameter with utm_campaign to the link, we will give you the opportunity to place your vacancy for free.  <b>To do this, just write to us about your decision at hr@tmtm.ru</b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/351822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/351822/</a></p>
