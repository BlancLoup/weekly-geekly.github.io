The rest of the model remained unchanged: a simple modular design that fits easily into a backpack for traveling. <br><br><hr><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/137596013/phonedrone-ethos-a-whole-new-dimension-for-your-sm">PhoneDrone Ethos - will give your smartphone wings</a> </h3><br>  <em>Investors: 1256</em> <br>  <em>$ 325,952 out of $ 100,000 collected</em> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jp-u4yF5YOY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhK0YhI3AltVaW8WFrrPllRB0E5cg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Development from Xcraft, which will allow your smartphone to rise into the air.  The company is an innovator in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles, its main goal is to create small, powerful flying machines that will change the world.  Initially, the smartphone was designed to work in "earthly" conditions.  But PhoneDrone Ethos is the most wonderful device that will give your smartphone wings and expand its functions, allowing you to use your iPhone or Android phone as a standalone aerial camera. <br><br>  This revolutionary development uses a sensor, processor and wireless communication with a smartphone and turns PhoneDrone Ethos into a powerful aircraft. <br><br>  It is easy to use, has an intuitive interface and does not require piloting skills.  Its design does not imply high material costs, since the processor and sensors of the smartphone itself are used.  The ability to manage streaming videos and shoot from various angles.  Flight time: 15-20 minutes.  The device is compatible with iOS, Android and Apple Watch. <br><br><hr><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/393053146/powerup-fpv-live-streaming-paper-airplane-drone">PowerUp FPV - paper streaming video</a> </h3><br>  <em>Investors: 1955</em> <br>  <em>Collected $ 375,227 out of $ 100,000</em> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/162XTuVoJpw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiIjNYdEd70ZCa0mAc2nWA9ATQhNw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Developer Shai Goitein (Shai Goitein) has been keen on aviation for over 25 years.  PowerUp FPV presents its second project at Kickstarter, developed in collaboration with Parrot, an AR Drone company. <br><br>  PowerUp FPV - the first ever paper airplane with streaming video.  Feelings, which the user experiences, are comparable with the real flight, if you were sitting in the cockpit.  This effect is achieved through the use of Google Cardboard.  The developers have created an attractive advertisement, and also shot several commercials demonstrating the capabilities of the airplane.  There are many functions for flight control, and the autopilot function as well. <br><br><hr><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/555543571/koova-the-koolest-auto-tracking-robot-camera">Koova - robotic auto-tracking camera</a> </h3><br>  <em>Investors: 11</em> <br>  <em>Collected $ 1859 out of $ 1000</em> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/U02xeZACgiI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiuQb48baJVNwFWudtjcCxfK2qVUw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Koova is a small camera that has the function of auto-tracking and face recognition.  The main purpose is to be responsible for security in your home.  If malefactors get into the dwelling, sensors of the camera work.  The device immediately notifies all family members connected to the system. <br><br>  The developer of Amaryllo International is a company from Amsterdam, which specializes in creating smart home products that ensure its safety.  The project has collected a lot of positive feedback and the amount is twice the amount that was originally planned. <br><br><hr><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vivienmuller/ulo/description">Ulo - cute interactive camera</a> </h3><br>  <em>Investors: 8330</em> <br>  <em>Collected ‚Ç¨ 1 618 869 from ‚Ç¨ 199 000</em> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RbiqkoGG08%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjBqYgIeA0LZoIRKCm1ouRPp88ORg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Ulo is a project similar to the previous one - it is a cute surveillance camera in the shape of an owl, which interacts with the user through the expressions of the eyes.  The author of the project believes that the expression of the eyes - non-verbal communication - is one of the most effective in the world. <br><br>  The application on the mobile phone allows you to customize the eye color, shape and size to fit the interior and the taste of the user.  The development does not use icons or text, but from the expression of the eyes, one can easily understand what Ulo means: when the battery is low, the owl looks tired, and when it is observed, the eyes move actively. <br><br><hr><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2074714954/phiro-a-smart-robot-for-kids-learn-to-code-in-5-wa/description">PHIRO: a robot that will teach children programming</a> </h3><br>  <em>Investors: 268</em> <br>  <em>Collected $ 81,380 out of $ 50,000</em> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nc5kHtx0HHY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhbHowdw8Rvfk-qykviMm6pSqWgWg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The authors of the project believe that children learn little to read, write and arithmetic, and in the future they will need more advanced skills.  And an effective way to develop skills in children is the Phiro platform.  This is a platform for coding, creating robots and games. <br><br>  Two types of robots designed for different age groups were created: for children from 4 to 8 years old - Phiro Unplugged and Phiro Pro for those from 9 to 18 years old.  In the process of learning, the child receives programming skills and learns binary coding without a computer.  And more mature users continue learning free open source programming languages. <br>  All these skills will enable children to succeed in the future. <br><br><hr><br><br>  <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/obzor-proektov-robotov-na-kickstarter-ot-robohunter">Presented on Kickstarter</a> and less successful projects that could not collect the required amount before the end of the term. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceonefpv/fpv-racing-drones-by-space-one-fpv%3Fref%3Dcategory_popular">FPV Racing Drones - racing drone</a> </h3><br>  <em>Investors: 30</em> <br>  <em>Collected $ 1,768 out of $ 5,000</em> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/U2y0LGtmLo4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjk_m-8tdH8HkgJQOy4sTQAFil4Ng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  FPV Racing Drones by Space One FPV development designed for racing.  Racing competitions, with the participation of drones, promise to become as popular as Formula 1.  A new era of games, where the player is fully immersed in flight, as if he is in a quadrocopter cabin.  The effect of "presence in the cabin" is achieved by the installed camera and glasses for the game.  Carbon fiber construction is used in racing drones, which makes this development unique.
