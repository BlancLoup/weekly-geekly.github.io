(How many seats have been spent since then!) This time the post will be about Herman Miller Mirra 2 - the heir to the famous "Aeron", which, moreover, is newer - even cheaper than the "Aeron" (but still <a href="http://www.hmshop.ru/catalog/mirra/">expensive</a> , if that). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a46/f97/f26/a46f97f2621c487682133acc9dcff147.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will begin with a small background: it turns out that Aerons were produced and issued in three sizes - for small, normal and fat asses, respectively.  The first option is for women and children, the second one is for everyone else, the third one is, well, an American-made chair, so it was impossible to do without the third option (@boomburum, what is your size, by the way?). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/201/f2d/dd7/201f2ddd77e2448e89c3fb7f5410982f.jpg">

      In the case of ‚ÄúMirra‚Äù, the manufacturer decided to approach the issue of sizes from the other end, releasing a chair with the maximum number of adjustments that should fit literally everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/584/41b/0a1/58441b0a197b4ed38bc1262548d56ddc.jpg"><br><br>  In total, I counted eleven adjustments: <br><br>  1. Seat height adjustment: four heights, in increments of 5 cm - 45-50-55-60 cm from the floor. <br><br>  2. Three armrest adjustments: <br><br><ul><li>  width (for thick) </li><li>  on departure (for those who have long arms) </li><li>  around the corner.  Brackets (height of armrests) right under the palms </li></ul><br>  3. Adjust the stiffness of the back.  A special rounder, resembling the one in which the car adjusts the back angle is responsible for its rigidity: it has quite a few turns (about 50 half-turns, ie 25 whole), which can adjust the grid tension from the pushing hard version to the almost relaxed hammock : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed4/f66/9a8/ed4f669a8dfb4f8781034646c893d6be.jpg"><br><br>  The correct option is when in a relaxed position there is a reserve back and forth. <br><br>  4. Seat depth adjustment (departure). <br><br>  5. Adjusting the lumbar support: the two handles allow it to be loosened or, conversely, to create appreciable pressure in this area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4b/ef4/bae/a4bef4bae10141d289fd702d4e87adc6.jpg"><br><br>  6. This adjustment has a second dimension: it changes in height - which is logical, because  loins of all at different heights.  In general, where groped - there and make the waist. <br><br>  7. Leaning back.  Two steps of the tilting petal: 0, 1, 2: in the zero position, the back is fixed almost vertically, with a minimum stroke of a couple of degrees, in the intermediate position - you can lean back thoughtfully, and with the petal fully lowered, the backrest leans at an angle of almost 45 degrees - a rocking chair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f1/f7a/b1d/0f1f7ab1d2ef438a8a14fa7f67960045.jpg"><br><br>  8. Adjust the seat angle relative to the back.  The petal of this adjustment is located directly in front of the lever that regulates the backrest.  This adjustment allows you to select one of two modes: normal and working.  To switch them, you must first completely otkuinutsya back.  In the upper position of the petal is fixed the usual mode of the position of the back, described above.  If, having thrown back, to switch the petal down - when you return back, the back will straighten up more, and the seat will tilt forward slightly - the angle between them does not change, they simply tilt forward more, as if pushing the user forward - but in fact, following the user's posture, leaning over to the computer, and providing his back support.  Of course, to manage all this is simple - the hand easily reaches the petals of the adjustments in any position. <br><br>  9. Angle of the front ramp: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/912/0dd/97d/9120dd97d7f24f20923769af28de133b.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to active adjustments, there are a number of passive elements of comfort.  First of all, it is the shape of the back (passive adjustment): the grid cells differ in size ‚Äî harder from below, softer from above.  The idea is to maintain the lower (intact) spine, which accounts for the maximum load.  Grid Dupont has no memory effect: it can not sit. <br><br>  It is easy to deal with this economy - everything, in principle, is at hand (since you have to reach for adjusting the lumbar selection) - know, roll, until it becomes comfortable.  Knowledge of ‚Äúhow to‚Äù is more important.  The buyer of the armchair gets it together with the armchair itself in the form of a brochure with vivid pictures that comes in the kit.  One of the most important explanations - the height of the landing should be adjusted so that the angle of the knees is straight, and the armrest - so that the angle of the arm is blunt (relaxed arm). <br><br>  Front petal: 5 degrees. <br><br><h4>  Where is the headrest? </h4><br>  Taking advantage of the opportunity, I asked for a visit to the <a href="http://www.contractinteriors.ru/">Contract Interiors</a> and asked about one interesting part - the missing part of the chair: the head restraint. <br><br>  As a separate part of the seat headrests appeared relatively recently - as part of car seats.  The pioneer was the company Volvo (which first began to use seat belts, by the way), and they used head restraints to protect the head from being hit in the back - to prevent tipping of the head and neck fracture.  At home, protection against such overload is not required - the neck of a healthy person is fully capable of keeping his head on his shoulders without outside help. <br><br>  Even leaning back in ‚ÄúMirra‚Äù to spit at the ceiling, there is no sensation of a dummy with a head on a spring.  Not that this convinced me completely - after all, scenarios for using chairs are different, for example, someone might want to pokemarten in him - but for everyday use the need for a headrest never overcame me.  We can say that the need for a headrest from the category of phantom - you only feel it when you remember it. <br><br>  My past chair - for nothing, which is three times cheaper than the "Mirra" - was with a headrest.  I have repeatedly tried to adjust it so that the headrest constantly propped up the back of my head - but this was never successful, i.e.  I felt the head restraint only when I was fully reclining on it.  I was sure that it was such a bug, whether it was me or the chair.  After ‚ÄúMirra‚Äù, I basically almost believed that the head restraints in home / work chairs really are not needed. <br><br>  Almost - because the same "Aeron" headrest as an option is still there. <br><br><h4>  Mirra vs Bureaucrat </h4><br>  Since this is not my first chair, selected in the search for an ergonomic-orthopedic ideal, it would be wrong not to make a small blitz-comparison of "Mirra" with <a href="">my former chair</a> .  Unfortunately, a full-fledged comparative review will not work, because  I sold the Bureaucrat when I moved a few months ago. <br><br>  There are not so many striking differences.  Buro has fewer settings (the armrests cannot be adjusted for expansion, there is no such thing as adjusting the backrest or lumbar support).  What is felt by the skin - literally - is the quality of the material.  In both cases it is textiles, but in the ‚ÄúBureaucrat‚Äù it is coarse - from time to time the back was scratched.  The fabric of ‚ÄúMirra‚Äù is much more humane to the material with which the surface of people is covered - it was a great relief for me!  But in both cases, the fact that this is a grid is a plus for hot days. <br>  The rest of the qualities of the category of those that are checked when you put the twins in these chairs, and a year later take measurements.  ‚ÄúMirra‚Äù should be better - for example, from the very beginning Buro had a small, non-lethal, but very annoying backlash of the armrests.  For Herman Miller is difficult to imagine, the warranty on the chair - 12 years.  And users, by the way, are not allowed to assemble - ‚ÄúMirra‚Äù is brought in the already assembled form in a huge box. <br><br><h4>  Mirra vs Aeron </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a5/3a8/ad7/0a53a8ad7fb94e9186efbe9bed7fa4d2.jpg"><br><br>  By all measures, it turns out that Mirra 2 is more modern and better than Aeron - but why is it cheaper?  Honestly, I never heard a satisfactory answer to this question, because  it lies somewhere in the field of components and materials.  Like, a new chair - new suppliers, the best prices.  In this case, Aeron is still sold, and sold successfully.  This is due to the popular brand, and, probably, its price - at some level, especially when it comes to corporate customers, the price is considered as an indicator of quality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef4/517/aa5/ef4517aa54ef4412b4ce60d5a1e86e19.jpg"><br>  <i>Passive adjustment in the form of a mesh back "Mirra" is clearly visible when compared with the "Aeron"</i> <br><br>  Mirra is not lower class, more functional - you can buy it remotely, and not be afraid that you will not get into size.  And it looks a bit more modern.  Actually, this is my case - I took it with delivery to another city.  For the review, I decided to take off the turquoise chair, for which I stopped at the Moscow office of Contract Interiors - I thank them for this opportunity and the answers to the questions, without which this text would have been much less informative. <br><br>  PS Prices for chairs in Russia remain the same at least until the end of the year.  What will happen next - I was not told, but I think growth is inevitable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362913/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362913/</a></p>
