  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Life hacking or How to significantly reduce the cost of office Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you know that 5-10 office computers can work on one Yota modem?  In Moscow, where unlimited tariffs for corporate users do not exist in principle, and the extra traffic can fly into such a pretty penny, this is especially important.  In principle, the main idea is already clear, but if you need more details - feel sorry for the cat. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The background is as follows: there was only one small Moscow office where, according to the terms of the lease agreement, it was possible to use the services of only one Internet provider with the telling name <a href="http://www.gptel.ru/">Gopotel</a> .  One fine spring day, on the 3rd of May, a network card flew in this office because of a thunderstorm.  That is, the problem was in the network, it became known later, and then the girls working there simply noticed that there was no Internet.  And they began to call Gptel's support service.  And do not get through!  All the day, the third of May, she simply did not answer - as it turned out, again, later, they had a day off. <br><br>  A good young man screwed up here: a monopolist provider with inactive technical support - who needs nafig such happiness?  However, the Russian man was given a sharpness to find a way out of the most hopeless situations: I came to the office with my Yota and connected the modem to the central computer, from which the Internet was distributed to all other office machines.  The Internet is slow and painful, but still earned.  Moreover, when I replaced the standard iota DNS servers with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/77199/">Google's 8.8.8.8</a> , it earned significantly faster :) In fact, 6 computers are hanging on one modem - and even YouTube videos can be watched without brakes.  The girls from the office even claim that the speed has become even supposedly better than it was on the Gopotelovskaya vydelenka - but for that they are girls, we will write off the excessive impressionability :)

      By the way, about the price of the issue: the price of the issue is 900 rubles per month for the Yoto subscriber.  In principle, if the office is large, then the price should be multiplied by the number of modems (one modem for 10 computers is enough, in principle).  But it is still incomparable with the requests of ordinary providers - Gopotel, for example, ate at 8-10 thousand rubles a month with very modest traffic to gigs of 10-12 gigs. <br><br>  The director of the office, in disbelief of his own happiness, immediately rushed to buy a yotovsky modem.  By the way, taking this opportunity, I advised to take the Yota Jingle - it was interesting to check the conclusions of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/91294/">habra-survey</a> , in which the jingle broke the standard Samsung U200 modem in terms of the quality of the signal reception in the flaps. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1b/70c/62a/f1b70c62a7504c1a3087891d73954d1e.jpg" width="320" height="217" align="left" hspace="20">  It turned out to be absolutely true: where my modem showed the signal level is medium - sometimes good, Jingle consistently gives out good - excellent. <br><br>  Minuses?  They are obvious: Yota still catches not everywhere (although for the most part Moscow and its neighbors, signal reception is honestly good and is constantly improving - in the same office three months ago my modem did not see the network at all).  Therefore, if you have Yota catches, then why not send nafig snickering providers? <br><br>  UPD In the comments suggest that for corporate access Yota has a <a href="http://www.yota.ru/ru/business/prices/">special tariff plan</a> - 2,700 rubles per month. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94261/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94261/</a></p>
