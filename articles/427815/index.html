      In principle, any other person could be in the same situation if, for example, a purse with money and documents was stolen from him, with the only difference being that in such a case you need to call the bank even faster to block the card. <br><br>  Then the idea was born of the service of free calls for users from abroad to banks, insurance companies, etc. - so that any person could, using free Wi-Fi or other available network, make a call back home and solve their problems without spending money on connection <br><br>  Now this feature is implemented in <a href="https://www.mob1.biz/product">M1 Messenger</a> . <br><br>  It's easy to use - you need to download and install an instant messenger (registration without a phone number) and then find the required bank in the search bar: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2s/l1/4z/2sl14zoid3mzw4lrr-ryvhidpq8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lz/cf/bm/lzcfbmqcqawdm4x3issx1aiqcge.jpeg"><br><br>  Next, you need to add to the bot of the bank and after authorization, calls to the call center of the bank immediately become available: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v1/-q/a6/v1-qa63-tyidsyin0bwjpfnqvgk.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bf/bk/vt/bfbkvt_g6sdqxpjsn5ixmiozq_g.jpeg"><br><br>  Currently 20 Russian banks are connected - all of them you can make calls for free from anywhere in the world: <br><br>  - PAO Sberbank <br>  - VTB Bank <br>  - Gazprombank <br>  - Bank "Otkrytie FC" <br>  - ALFA-BANK JSC <br>  - JSC "Agricultural Bank" <br>  - Bank NCC <br>  - JSC UniCredit Bank <br>  - Promsvyazbank PJSC <br>  - PJSC ROSBANK <br>  - JSC "Raiffeisenbank" <br>  - PJSC "Moscow Credit Bank" <br>  - PJSC "Bank" Saint-Petersburg" <br>  - AB "RUSSIA" <br>  - JSC "Russian Standard Bank" <br>  - PJSC "AK BARS" BANK <br>  - Nordea Bank <br>  - Public Joint-Stock Company National Bank "TRUST" <br>  - PJSC "BANK URALSIB" <br>  - JSC CB CITIBANK <br>  - Bank Tinkoff <br><br>  <b>Numbers 8-800 (Toll Free) or how telephonists make money by shaking the air</b> <br><br>  All users know that calls to 8-800 are free for them, but few know what is happening on the other side of this free. <br><br>  In fact, the owner of such a number pays for each call from the user and pays much more than if the user paid for his outgoing call. <br><br>  A call costs the owner 2-3 times more expensive. <br><br>  In addition, there is a one-time installation fee per room, for the number of lines in the pool 8-800 (the number of simultaneous calls), monthly subscription fee and per-minute payment. <br>  If the call is received from a mobile phone, the payment for an incoming call is even higher. <br><br>  It is also worth noting that such numbers are not accessible from abroad and, although they are called non-geographical, are in fact limited to the territory. <br><br>  All this is done with the sole purpose of making the call free for an ordinary user. <br><br>  Such care was relevant many years ago, but now, with the advent of instant messengers and free Internet conversations, such numbers are anachronism. <br><br>  In addition, it is inconvenient - the user needs to find this number somewhere, to check whether he dialed it correctly from the product label or card, etc. <br><br>  You cannot send a message, a picture, etc. to such a number. <br>  If the operator asks where you are, then you cannot just send your location, as you would have done using a regular instant messenger. <br><br>  Instead, we propose another way - a user in the search for <a href="https://www.mob1.biz/product">M1 Messenger</a> finds a company (bank, institution, etc.) by name and immediately makes a call and such a call lands either in an office PBX or call center, i.e. existing infrastructure. <br><br>  Connecting such a letter identifier to a PBX or call center is no more difficult than connecting any virtual number. <br><br>  A bot can be a bonus that can provide the most frequently requested information with text or multimedia messages - send a picture, send a location, etc. <br><br>  And in more complicated cases, the user can make a call to communicate with a live operator. <br><br>  The user does not need to memorize or write down such a number - it is always in the directory and is located by keywords. <br><br>  Also, a business can communicate via such a channel with the user - send important information that would be useful to the consumer. <br><br>  And on the other hand - the user can, if such messages / calls are annoying to block such communication at any time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427815/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427815/</a></p>
