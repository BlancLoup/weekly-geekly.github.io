      <br>
      The first mention of Ruby I saw in one of <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> 's articles.  The syntax of the language seemed very pleasant and concise.  Then in summer practice I was offered to try to make a project on Ruby on Rails;  I agreed only because of Ruby, I didn't know anything about Rails then.  Since this all started. <br><br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  I am the team leader of the Martians team, which works on the Gett project (also known as GetTaxi).  We are helping Gett build a micro-service architecture - this is what my report at the conference will be about.  There is also my own (yet secret) project related to data analysis and analytics, which I am ready to talk about on the sidelines. <br><br><br>  <b>What would you do if you had 2 months of free paid time?</b> <br><br>  Half the time I would have invested in finalizing the prototype of my secret project before the release.  Half - would spend on immersion in a new programming language. <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite resources (blogs / sites / twitter) on web development and programming?</b> <br><br>  If we are still talking about Ruby and Rails, I recommend the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby">Reddit</a> section.  I really like the weekly commit about Rails from <a href="https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/">RailsWeekly</a> .  I also recommend paying attention to the mailings from <a href="https://cooperpress.com/">CooperPress</a> .  From podcasts like <a href="https://ruby5.codeschool.com/">Ruby5</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a> .  Sometimes I also listen to <a href="http://rubynoname.ru/">Ruby NoName Podcast</a> - and it happens! <br><br><br>  <b>Best read book on programming / technology?</b> <br><br>  It would be very strange to single out one best book.  I would rather call those that are worth reading for sure: <br>  - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC">The structure and interpretation of computer programs</a> , published by MIT; <br>  - <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3159814/">Perfect code</a> Steve McConnell; <br>  - <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/1308678/">Refactoring.</a>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/1308678/">Improving the existing</a> Martin Fowler <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/1308678/">code</a> . <br><br><br>  <b>Not tired of programming?</b> <br><br>  Not. <br><br><br>  <b>In your opinion, in what direction will Ruby and Ruby on Rails develop in the coming years?</b> <br><br>  I think the vector of development of the language and framework globally will remain the same as it was.  If we are talking about Ruby, I expect a further improvement in GC and work on concurrency.  If I‚Äôm talking about Rails, I‚Äôm going to work on a general acceleration of the entire stack, and nobody has canceled the need to implement cool HTTP / 2 support. <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite programming language after Ruby, why him?</b> <br><br>  A programming language is just a tool for achieving results.  For each task pane, this is your own tool that you need to be able to use in order to be ready to work with any class of tasks.  Of the new languages, it would be most interesting for me to work with Rust, Scala and Clojure. <br><br><br>  <b>What is open source for you?</b> <br><br>  Open Source is an opportunity.  At first it is the opportunity to participate in large projects;  from monitoring development to correcting errors and adding new functionality.  The next stage is the possibility of implementing your own ideas and receiving feedback. <br><br><br>  <b>What advice would you give to developers who want to achieve great success?</b> <br><br>  Recently, the chatter has become many times more, but the real business is many times less.  Therefore, the advice will be extremely simple - practice, write and read more code, try new tools, concepts and architectures. <br><br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview and see you in Moscow!</b> <br><br>  At the conference, Andrei will talk about microservice architecture in practice. <br><br>  The team of Martians under the leadership of Andrew helped Gett (formerly known as GetTaxi) to move from monolithic architecture to the use of microservices - in combat mode, in four countries (USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Israel).  This allowed us to significantly speed up and simplify work on the development of new directions. <br><br>  Instead of theoretical stories about how great it is to use microservices and why everyone supposedly must do it, Andrei will concentrate on practice and combat experience.  In the report, he will talk about the difficulties encountered in the development of microservices and ways to solve them - the implementation of service interaction (using REST API), system state versioning, change logging (COW strategy), distributed configuration (ZooKeeper), working with shared parts microservices, deployment (Chef) and testing.  Separately, Andrey will elaborate on the implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern for solving problems in the communication channel between services. <br><br>  Interesting?
