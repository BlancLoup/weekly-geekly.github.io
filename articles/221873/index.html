I bring to your attention a review of our IaaS solution called <b>Dynamic Data Center</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76f/a12/01c/76fa1201ce238b8ca425ddf257b06525.jpg"><br>  <i>Solution Chart Dynamic Data Center</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  TelecityGroup Finland knows about the ‚Äúclouds‚Äù firsthand.  The first cloud platform was deployed back in 2008, and during this time various hardware resources and options for building a cloud infrastructure were tested.  Earlier this year, the platform was upgraded, and the IaaS solution offered to customers was called the Dynamic Data Center, or DDC for short.  Why Dynamic Data Center, you ask?  First of all, I wanted to reflect the scalability and the possibility of flexible capacity expansion.  In addition, the services offered by various cloud providers are replete with terms such as ‚Äúvirtual server‚Äù, ‚ÄùIaaS, PaaS, SaaS‚Äù, ‚Äùcloud‚Äù, which sometimes is nothing more than a marketing ploy.

    <h4>  <b>What distinguishes the DDC service from others?</b> <b><br></b> </h4><br>  The main ‚Äúchips‚Äù are the complete fault tolerance of the solution, unsurpassed storage system performance, an additional services package, a variety of resource accounting and a convenient self-service portal.  But first things first. <br><br><h5>  <b>Fault tolerance of the solution</b> <br></h5><br>  It is provided at all levels, from the physical site and communication channels to the innovative storage system and server blade farms. <br><br>  The physical platform on which the virtual infrastructure is deployed is no less important than the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù of the platform.  If the data center is ‚Äúup‚Äù, no penalties will save your critical IT systems from interruptions.  The DDC solution is deployed on the basis of two own data centers TelecityGroup <b>Hiomo</b> and <b>Uspenski</b> .  Both data centers have been certified to <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001">ISO 27001</a> , which serves as an additional confirmation of the reliability of information protection, as well as the availability of a set of measures to identify and eliminate potential risks.  At the request of customers, you can replicate virtual machines in an additional data center, where they will run when the main data center is unavailable.  Backups are stored in the third, physically remote, data center <b>Suvilahti</b> . <br><br>  The hardware filling of the platform is represented by IBM Flex System blade servers and storage connected via SAN (Storage Area Network) using FC technology (Fiber Channel).  The solution is deployed on the basis of VMware, the world leader in virtualization.  Thanks to VMware High Availability, when a single physical server crashes, the VM automatically restarts on the other (for more details on the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/ru/products/vsphere/features/high-availability.html">VMware</a> website).  In addition, a backup copy of the image of each virtual is created daily, from which you can restore a ‚Äúfallen‚Äù VM at the request of customers.  In addition, we provide an agent-based backup service, details below. <br><br>  As for the storage systems, they differ depending on the category of disk resources.  For the vStorage Silver category, this is, for example, the IBM DCS3700 and Hitachi.  For the Gold category - <b>IBM XIV Storage System</b> , which I want to talk about in more detail. <br><br>  With its innovative grid architecture, the IBM XIV Storage System provides unmatched performance and scalability.  Grid-architecture consists of a set of similar components, united by a common interconnect.  The disks in IBM XIV behave like ‚Äúcommunicating vessels‚Äù, due to which their uniform load is achieved.  All IBM XIV components are reserved under the Active-Active N + 1 scheme, ensuring a high level of reliability and availability.  In case of failure of any component, the fastest recovery is ensured. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf6/3dc/fae/bf63dcfaeecb779c2fa4399c0e0dfbe9.jpg"><br>  <i>Comparison of traditional storage systems and IBM XIV Storage System</i> <br><br>  A few words about the channels of communication.  Communication with the ‚Äúoutside world‚Äù is provided by our own 10 Gbps fiber-optic network connecting all data centers with redundant connections.  In case of failure of one of the communication channels, an automatic switch to the other takes place.  By default, a guaranteed bandwidth of 100 Mbps is provided, which can optionally be extended to 10 Gbps.  For large customers, connection of dedicated communication channels can be arranged.  Let me remind you that the data centers TelecityGroup - with neutral accessibility.  If you want a specific communication provider on the site - always welcome.  The Dynamic Data Center solution deployed on the basis of Finnish data centers ‚Üí delays on communication channels to Russia (in comparison with other European countries) are insignificant. <br><br><h5>  <b>Unsurpassed Disk Subsystem Performance</b> <b><br></b> </h5><br>  We were interested to compare the performance of our storage with other cloud providers.  The test results were pleasantly surprised.  For ethical reasons, I will not publish the names of a number of companies, but in general, I think the picture is clear.  I will note (so that we are not reproached with bias) that now a similar independent test is being conducted by one independent company, of which we will definitely report the results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a9/af4/33e/3a9af433e2a128d84505421518057868.jpg"><br>  <i>Test results for random reading and writing blocks of 4 kilobytes</i> <i><br></i>  <i>For testing, the utility <a href="http://freecode.com/projects/fio">FIO (Flexible I / O tester) was used</a> .</i>  <i>VM 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM, CentOS 6.4 64bit was installed.</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/005/13c/c23/00513cc23fa7740efc23f89c294ccee3.jpg"><br>  <i>More detailed statistics on our storage systems for levels Gold and Silver</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><h5>  <b>Package of additional services</b> <b><br></b> </h5><br>  <b>A range of additional services is provided in conjunction with the DDC service:</b> <b><br></b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ data backup, two options: Advanced and Simple <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5e/b52/1bb/f5eb521bb3069edec540102265546b38.jpg"><br>  <i>For the Advanced option on the basis of the Commvalt Simpana software, a self-service portal is available, where you can manage the backup schedule yourself, back up and restore data without a provider.</i>  <i>The Simple option is deployed based on Veeam Backup &amp; Replication and provides the ability to backup a VM image with a storage horizon of 7 or 30 days at a remote site.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Managed Firewall service <br>  3 levels of service provision, from basic to advanced with support for IPsec tunneling and performance up to 200 Mbps. <br>  ‚Ä¢ load balancing based on Citrix Netscaller <br>  ‚Ä¢ hybrid solution (physical + virtual infrastructure) <br>  ‚Ä¢ connection of dedicated communication channels <br>  ‚Ä¢ server monitoring <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e91/c5a/048/e91c5a048bc0ac6c7ce676439204f189.jpg"><br><br><h5>  <b>Variety of resource accounting</b> <b><br></b> </h5><br>  TelecityGroup always for an individual approach to the client.  We are pleased to offer various options for accounting for virtual resources, and always pre-conduct an audit of the current IT infrastructure of the customer to select the most optimal option. <br><br>  <b>Option 1: the</b> upper and lower limits of the allocation of computing resources <b>are</b> individually negotiated.  The lower limit is guaranteed and the resources between the upper and lower limits are allocated on demand and are paid upon consumption.  This ensures payment flexibility and scalability.  Disk resources are paid on the fact of consumption. <br><br>  <b>Option 2: a</b> pool of resources with a fixed monthly fee for customers who can predict the amount of virtual capacity they need. <br><br>  <b>Option 3:</b> Full-scale Pay-as-you-Go model with hourly billing. <br><br>  Billing is automated, and in a short time it will be possible to view the statistics of spending funds directly on the self-service portal.  Now you can get information from our support service, which serves your interests around the clock, seven days a week.  Incidentally, regardless of the option prepayment is not required. <br><br><h5>  <b>Convenient self-service portal</b> <b><br></b> </h5><br>  The self-service portal allows the customer to fully control IT resources deployed in the cloud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83b/0e3/3da/83b0e33da35ebf0760eb4e67e28ec08b.jpg"><br>  <i>Portal Start Page</i> <i><br><br></i>  It is possible to manage all levels of the virtual infrastructure, from one virtual machine (VM) to a VM group (vApp) and a whole virtual data center (vDC).
