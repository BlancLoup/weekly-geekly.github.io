Today we will talk about a serious product focused on the corporate segment and on professionals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/195/c45/c22/195c45c22ca4685d94c9ca364a337ccc.jpg"><br><br>  In general, Fujitsu produces a variety of notebook models for a wide variety of white-collar categories, but the LIFEBOOK T902 is something special. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Outside, the T902 looks discreet.  Not too thin magnesium alloy body, made in the classic black and silver gamut, a display with a rather wide frame, an island keyboard and touchpad, shifted slightly to the left from the center.  Indicators, a row of buttons and a fingerprint scanner are located below the display, which is somewhat unusual, but there are good reasons for this decision. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/412/2cc/dd3/4122ccdd38e9dbd3b33725d026fa2d3d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14e/b81/b7e/14eb81b7e50b72f99a4796802655b085.jpg"><br><br>  Let's start with the most obvious: this is a transformer.  The lid confidently holds the position given to it, while it is not difficult at all to hold the top part, rotate it 180 ¬∞ and lay it face down on the keyboard.  Fujitsu brand hinge, tested on many models of transformers, does not rattle, has no noticeable backlash and runs like clockwork.  And such a change in the form factor turns out to be very convenient in many cases - for example, if the front row of seats in an airplane was too close to be able to work comfortably on a regular laptop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c97/1fd/373/c971fd373563cf55fc0b730441cd331e.jpg"><br><br>  As befits a product for professionals, the laptop is equipped with an abundance of interfaces.  On the left side there is a VGA (D-Sub), HDMI, two USB 3.0 ports, and two audio jacks, on the right USB 2.0 and a Kensington lock slot.  At the back is another USB 2.0 and LAN port, and in the front are indicators, an SD / SDHC / SDCX card reader and a switch for wireless adapters.  A two-megapixel camera is installed above the display, a fingerprint scanner and one more line of indicators are located below the display on the left.  In the same place, under the display, it is possible to notice openings for two microphones (on the left and on the right). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d17/9cd/65f/d179cd65f0b028f8b67c0b4f09378371.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/daa/6ce/412/daa6ce412df5b6134123f20a035eafc7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/414/db6/ff2/414db6ff2ec6b167c1ede84289e87d6b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f9/6cb/6e5/4f96cb6e5b18a51b458127d00b96eb1b.jpg"><br><br>  The row of buttons on the right is responsible for calling the Metro interface in Windows 8, adjusting the volume, and locking the screen orientation change.  The functions of the last two buttons (A and B) can be configured.  From the very edge is the power switch.  What is interesting is that this is not a button; you need to move it to the right to turn on the laptop.  This is done in order to eliminate accidental pressing, such a solution is much more practical than a button recessed into the body, and it looks very industrial.  Finally, on the bottom panel you can find an indispensable Fujitsu docking station connector - no serious laptop can do without it. <br><br>  The 13.3-inch laptop display is based on an IPS matrix with a resolution of 1600x900 pixels.  Resolution, it is worth noting, is not a record one - the market is full of phones with Full HD-display, not that laptops - but a small pixel is not always a blessing, especially for CAD-applications.  Naturally, the screen is covered with anti-reflective coating: the fashion for gloss is over, and in this segment it was never needed.  In addition, the laptop is able to adapt the brightness of the display backlight under the ambient lighting. <br><br>  Needless to say, the display T902 touch and supports multitouch.  With the release of Windows 8 is already standard.  But try using your finger, or even a pen for capacitive screens, to work with the interface of the program, not designed for touch displays!  And if you need to make graphic and handwritten notes?  And at all torment.  And in LIFEBOOK T902 for this there is neither more nor less, and the inductive touch layer under the screen, made by the famous technology Wacom.  Inductive pen is stored in the notebook case in a special slot.  Positioning accuracy is very high over the entire screen area, it allows you to draw, work with drawings and diagrams, write by hand without the slightest difficulty.  And, by the way, the screen won't scratch with a touch pen, it is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e65/100/649/e65100649b21edcaff2bb67ce2554c70.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/881/92d/d53/88192dd530acaf988cd172f432b906a3.jpg"><br><br>  The filling of the laptop is staffed at an expectedly high level.  Processor from i5-3320M to 3-gigahertz i7-3540M, Intel Express QM77 chipset, 16 GB DDR3-1600 MHz RAM with two modules.  As a drive, you can install a hard drive with a capacity of up to 500 GB, a hybrid drive 500/8 GB or SSD up to 256 GB.  Communication exhaustion: dual-band WiFi adapter (802 / 11a / b / g / n300), Bluetooth 4.0, Gigabit Ethernet adapter and, optionally, the Sierra Wireless MC7710 3G / LTE module that supports Russian LTE frequencies.  The manufacturer specifies the speed to the user up to 100 Mbit / s and up to 50 Mbit / s from the user, in our reality you can count on a maximum of 50/25 Mbit / s in the conditions of confident reception of LTE, which is very, very good for cellular communication. <br><br>  In the T902 case there was a place and a variety of useful sensors, it has a GPS receiver, a magnetometer, a gyroscopic sensor, and a three-axis accelerometer.  The latter has a particularly useful application: the user can configure to disable the hard disk when the specified acceleration threshold is exceeded.  Agree, there is nothing improbable in the scenario of a laptop falling on a hard surface while working with an important project.  In such a situation, of all the components, a hard drive with unparked heads is most vulnerable, and no cushioning pads will save it - just disconnecting and parking until it drops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/398/ada/979/398ada97943ef0523a809c86d26a128c.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, all decent laptops have long since switched to solid state drives.  It is difficult to overestimate the convenience of fast loading the operating system, applications and documents.  They are not afraid of falling.  Here only their capacity is obviously too small for full-fledged work with volumetric data.  256 GB is more than enough for normal use of mail / web / office documents, but what if you work on a project with a ‚Äúweight‚Äù, say, in a half terabyte?  You can't do without a hard disk, but there is also no need to sacrifice amenities.  The Fujitsu LIFEBOOK T902 is designed to give the professional maximum flexibility.  Speech on the modular compartment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e3e/7c4/7b9/e3e7c47b91281c292b8aa3b907676100.jpg"><br><br>  This compartment, located on the right side of the case, can accommodate one additional module.  To install or replace it is not required to contact the service center.  In fact, even a screwdriver is not needed - the module is mounted on the latch, without special difficulties shifted by a finger.  The following modules are available: <br><ul><li>  stub (i.e. no module).  The way to ensure the lowest weight of the laptop, in this configuration, it will be 1.89 kg. </li><li>  hard drive or SSD.  A special cartridge allows you to install any 2.5-inch drive. </li><li>  DVD drive or Blu-ray burner.  Optical drives gradually disappear from the scene, but if you need to work with optical discs, the built-in module will be much more convenient than an external drive. </li><li>  extra battery.  The three-cell battery will extend battery life by 2.5-3 hours, bringing the total time to 10 hours in a typical scenario (according to BAPCO MobileMark 2007). </li></ul><br><br>  Thus, getting a set of additional modules, you can ‚Äúon the go‚Äù to change the characteristics of the T902, varying the weight, drives, battery life.  In addition, unlike consumer-grade laptops, the designers maximally ease access to all components whose service or replacement the user may require.  Through the hatches on the bottom panel you can get to the drive, memory, 3G / LTE module, and even to the cooling fan. <br><br>  Obviously, the Fujitsu LIFEBOOK T902 was created by professionals for professionals, hence all its features.  If you decide to purchase this product - think about whether it suits you, and you him.  And most importantly: apply in strict accordance with the instructions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201372/</a></p>
