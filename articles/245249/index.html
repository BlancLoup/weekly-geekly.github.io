This tool allows you to decompose everything, plan and control the execution of development tasks and / or project life cycle.  The pyramid of project needs allows you to assess the main points of project development and link with them the tasks and time for their implementation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The project needs pyramid is a tool that allows you to identify the basic needs for the project.  Satisfying each need allows the project to function within the framework specified by that need.  Also, each satisfied need opens up a new growth point for the project and allows revealing the next need.  The pyramid of needs covers the project from the outside, allows you to divide the project into groups of tasks according to the level of complexity and value derived from their implementation. <br><br>  The pyramid of the needs of the project (or company) is visually similar to the pyramid of Maslow's human needs, but only visually.  Unlike the human needs pyramid, the project needs pyramid is developed for each project separately (it is individual) and can vary based on short-term and long-term development forecasts, external and internal factors.  Also, the transition from one need to another does not mean that the previous need was fully satisfied, since, as is known, there is no limit to improvement in project activities.

      I propose to consider the company as an organism, with a clear structure, needs and action plan to meet them, which arise in the course of development, growth and subsequent extinction or a new round of growth. <br><br>  The location of the needs in the pyramidal form was not chosen by chance.  The pyramid and the project development process have a lot of similarities.  The pyramid visually strives upward, as the project always strives upward towards development.  The pyramid is built gradually, step by step, each stage is associated with certain difficulties.  Also, a new stage is not possible without creating the previous one.  The pyramid is both a complex structure and an excellent visualizer, so the location of the project‚Äôs needs by the pyramid will help to show at the same time the difficulties that people will encounter when implementing, and the stages and results to be achieved. <br><br>  The project needs pyramid is a pyramid consisting of at least seven groups of needs (Figure 1).  Not all of these groups of needs will necessarily be used in each project, this pyramid indicates the ideal location of needs.  But each business structure for growth needs to satisfy all the needs indicated in the figure. <br><br>  From the pyramid of the needs of the project, a tree-like system of the project (Figure 2) emerges, which will later be transferred to a convenient toolkit for implementation (for example, to the Gantt chart). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/39b/27d/f41/39b27df419f80586d839d5eff509b4e1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>* Figure 1. Pyramid of project needs</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c51/620/436/c51620436c78ba5c8ecf38b2f254d359.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 2. Tree-based project needs system</i> <br><br>  The development of the pyramid of project needs is currently relevant in that, during the period of stagnation and crisis, it makes it possible to clearly determine the current directions for the project‚Äôs development, and the investments that should be supported.  As well as those needs that should be suspended or postponed until previous needs are met.  Also, the needs pyramid can visualize actual and unsatisfied needs, which in the near future will help the project to improve its position.  That is to say, structure the growth points and see the potential for development. <br><br>  The company at the initial stage lives with the needs that the owners and the market place before it.  Most often these are the needs that allow a company to simply survive.  Not to grow, not to develop, but to survive.  That is, the company meets only vital needs - in the purchase of goods, equipment, hiring only key employees.  With the subsequent growth of the company, strengthening and in the maximum satisfaction of primary needs, new needs appear.  Most often, the company outgrows old needs.  Primary needs no longer allow the company to grow. <br><br>  Here lies the cornerstone of this approach, which shows that the growth of a company requires an increase in needs and their satisfaction.  If you do not meet the needs of growth will not.  Also with growth and maturity, the company can gradually move away from the primary needs to the needs of a higher value.  At the same time, lower needs will simply be rejected and will cease to play first a key, and in the future, any role in development. <br>  It is also not unimportant to understand that even the satisfaction of only primary needs gives the project a chance of survival.  That is, it is not necessary that the project will need to satisfy any higher hierarchy needs.  But if the project does not consistently meet the needs, it closes the opportunity for revenue growth. <br><br>  For example, the need for promotion through newspaper advertising in the early 2000s gave way to promotion through Internet advertising.  It ceded irrevocably, and the growing companies of the 90 have crossed the need. <br>  So in a crisis, to save money, a company can reduce its needs, starting with the higher ones, saving on growth.  Or vice versa, rejecting the lower, less efficient needs. <br>  Let's look at the needs of the project from the bottom up.  As a project, I consider the work of a commercial and public organization. <br><br>  <b>Primary needs or protoprotrabosti.</b>  These needs arise from the project at the very beginning of its formation.  First of all, the need for investment.  This type of needs will pull after itself, like a magnet, all other needs.  At the same time, it is not so much cash investments that are more important than time, energy and mental investments.  This need is basic, if you do not fulfill all primary needs, the project will start to slip in the future and sooner or will fail. <br><br>  <b>Needs extensive growth.</b>  These needs include the basic needs that need to be met by the project in order to survive in the initial period of its existence.  Most often, these needs are satisfied with the most economical and at the same time proven, not requiring complex performance and special skill, actions.  The needs of extensive growth imply a minimal creative.  To a greater degree these needs are met by proven tools copied and tested in other projects. <br><br>  <b>Needs of organizational change.</b>  The period of study and analysis of the work done, summarizing, understanding the level of satisfaction of needs and emerging new needs.  This is an important and difficult point, since as the needs grow, the project requires an increasingly professional, coherent approach.  The satisfaction of this need will entail a transition to a new competent level, the use of more complex tools and ultimately guarantee a better result.  This need requires professional and experienced creativity, a creative approach, and a view of the world and the project.  Most often, at this stage, improvements are made to the existing and existing project processes. <br><br>  <b>Needs intensive growth.</b>  Behind organizational changes, when the project prepares itself for further development, there comes a need for intensive growth, when the project uses previous developments to obtain a higher-quality and sought-after product.  To meet this need, we need trained and educated specialists who are ready to develop the project in new directions with the help of their experience and knowledge.  Also, to meet this need, most likely, we need new, large investments in the project.  At this stage, new processes are introduced into the project, which have proven themselves in similar projects, but for some reason there were roads in the previous stages of meeting the needs.  At this stage, work is being done on the tasks that were set while meeting the previous need. <br><br>  <b>The needs of fundamental change.</b>  Most often, at this stage, thoughtful and corrected, completely new processes are introduced into the project.  These new processes, up to this point, were little used or completely unused in similar projects.  These processes will continue to drastically change or complement the product and the project as a whole, ultimately complementing its maximum value. <br><br>  <b>The needs of strategic growth.</b>  This need at first glance is similar to the need for intensive growth.  But unlike the need for intensive growth, this need is satisfied by the most individual methods and tools.  It is at this stage that the tasks that were assigned to the project are fulfilled while satisfying the need for fundamental changes. <br><br>  <b>Higher needs.</b>  Under the highest needs, we will understand those needs that are beyond the planning horizon.  We are confident that we will have these needs, provided that all other needs are met, we can even voice them.  But the highest needs are so far away, or it is not exactly clear what exactly of them the project will have, that they are beyond the planning horizon.  Such needs, of course, can be, for example, the creation of regional offices, access to a foreign market, and so on.  That is, these needs are very large and are considered only to meet the needs of those who are lower in the hierarchy. <br><br>  It should also be noted that the growth in needs is also due to the fact that the needs located at the top of the pyramid bring great benefits to the project.  Therefore, the pursuit of higher needs is a motivating factor for the project.  But it is also worth considering the fact that higher needs require more energy and cost. <br><br>  <b>Basic costs (investments) to meet the needs:</b> <b><br></b>  ‚Ä¢ Health (not replenishable) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Education (refillable) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Vital energy (not renewable) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Time (not refillable) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Money (refillable) <br><br>  These costs are present in meeting each need, but their percentage component in meeting the needs is different and depends on the individual characteristics of the project, needs and people.  In addition, these costs are divided by the costs to be reimbursed and not reimbursable.  Consequently, it should be attentive to the allocation of costs for the project and the most logical to think about the satisfaction of each need. <br><br>  With the visual design of the pyramid of needs, the project is divided into stages (needs).  Each stage is a need and one division of the pyramid.  <b>At the same time, each need is characterized by several principles:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Reality.  The need can really be met, that is, brought to a tangible result.  Needs are met according to a previously prepared plan. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Logical.  The needs and the process of their satisfaction are built in a logical chain that meets the common sense and vision of the development of the project. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Time.  Satisfaction has a beginning, an exact time spent on satisfaction and an end.  We know exactly how long it will take us to meet our needs. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Perspective.  At the beginning, middle or end of the project, we begin to see the future development of the project.  We begin to feel what we lack, the project has new needs.  These new needs flow into the new division of the pyramid. <br><br>  <b>Let's give some examples.</b> <br>  As a first example, take a clothing store.  This is a shop in a mid-market mall, four sellers, an administrator, a dozen suppliers.  We view the store as a business aimed at making a profit for its founders.  Such a store will have a number of needs.  Primary needs, the needs of extensive growth, the needs of organizational growth, the needs of intensive growth, the needs of strategic growth, higher needs. <br><br>  Roughly, the pyramid will look like this: <br>  ‚Ä¢ The need for intensive growth.  To conduct trainings on sales, product knowledge for staff.  Optimize the representation of goods in the hall.  Revision of the order grid.  Create a program of stocks and sales.  Search and recruitment administrator.  Enter the system of indicators of store efficiency: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fb4/783/f39/fb4783f39a877858851fcb039d335081.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The need for organizational change.  Poor staff, changes needed.  Large stock balances, poorly sold.  Constantly late sellers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fb4/783/f39/fb4783f39a877858851fcb039d335081.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The need for extensive growth.  Follow the work of the staff, the cleanliness in the room.  Hang out all the models of the product hall.  Time to close and open the store.  Create gift cards.  Introduce discount cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fb4/783/f39/fb4783f39a877858851fcb039d335081.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Requirements.  Determine the budget for opening a store to find the area.  Sign a rental contract.  Hire staff.  Conclude contracts for the supply of goods.  Develop a design, make repairs.  Install equipment. <br><br>  This may look like a pyramid of needs for a clothing store development project. <br><br>  Let's consider the following example.  The company is engaged in the release of construction equipment.  Sales are built through the Internet and a few distributors.  There is no production, all production is outsourced. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The need for intensive growth.  Modify the machine control panel.  Order a few sketches of equipment agency industrial design.  Hire a secretary.  Remove several videos for product presentation, make professional photo products.  Get certificates for machine tools.  Take part in several industry shows.  Conduct development training, possibly hire a marketer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fb4/783/f39/fb4783f39a877858851fcb039d335081.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The need for organizational change.  The machine does not show the desired performance.  Equipment design is outdated.  We do not have time to draw up all the documents, make mistakes.  The client does not have enough information on the site.  There is little confidence in the product, it takes longer to convince customers.  It requires monitoring of the market, you need to monitor competitors, look for new items. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fb4/783/f39/fb4783f39a877858851fcb039d335081.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The need for extensive growth.  Order more types of equipment.  Expand advertising campaign on the Internet.  Sign a contract for several new phone numbers in the office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fb4/783/f39/fb4783f39a877858851fcb039d335081.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Requirements.  Remove the office.  Hire staff to the warehouse and office.  Find a manufacturer.  Create an Internet site.  Sign a contract with suppliers of components for machine tools. <br><br>  As can be seen from the examples, needs are divided by complexity and necessity, are arranged by a pyramid and are satisfied one after another.  Each new need stems from a previously satisfied need.  At each stage of meeting the need, you can stop, but then there is a risk that the project will not bring the desired result and the company will gradually fall into stagnation. <br><br>  I am confident that the pyramid of project needs will be successfully used as a tool for planning the development of the company.  The pyramid of needs helps to decompose the stages of the project into the main components, to see the future development. <br><br>  Waiting for criticism and feedback. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245249/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245249/</a></p>
