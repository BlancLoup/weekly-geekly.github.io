  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 changes in the issue format and algorithms of Google</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f57dabb3/fd9db320/005605c2/a40e446d.jpg"><br>  Continuing a series of publications on the Google Inside Search blog, revealing the features of Google's search algorithms, as well as describing in detail all the changes made to them, the chief engineer of the corporation <a href="http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2011/11/ten-recent-algorithm-changes.html">Matt Cutts listed the</a> 10 most significant changes in the search algorithm that came into force in the last 2 weeks: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Automatic translation in the search: as you know, a number of requests, people make in rare languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Afrikaans, Malay, Slovak, Swahili, Hindi, Norwegian, Serbian, Catalan, Maltese, Macedonian, Albanian, Slovenian, Welsh, and Icelandic), This significantly reduces the number of results in the issue.  To avoid this problem, Google will automatically translate into English all the resources containing the wording relevant to the request.  Previously, this feature was available only for requests in Korean.  In addition, Google provides the ability to translate a web page from English into the query language. <br><br>  2. New snippet format (displays a more complete containing pages and a less detailed title).  According to the Google team, such a snippet structure helps users select the text that is most relevant to the request, based on the actual content of the page, and not on its structure. <br><br>  3. Improved titles for pages in cases where the content of the title tag is ignored.  ‚ÄúWhen creating a title, Google uses a number of signals, one of which is the text in the anchors of the links leading to this page.  The result is a page with more relevant content in the issue, ‚Äùsays Matt Cats.

      4. Introduction of the auto-completion algorithm for Russian-language queries designed to reduce their length.  This improvement of the algorithm is intended to reduce the number of long, sometimes random queries in Russian. <br><br>  5. Extended application snippets allow people searching for applications to see their details of interest already on the SERP page.  For example, anyone can find out the cost of the application of interest, read a few reviews about it directly in the search results.  Such a change significantly expands the functionality of snippets and will be developed further. <br><br>  6. The factor of the number of links to an image from various pages on the web is no longer significant.  ‚ÄúBecause the global network is in constant motion and development, we often have to revise the ranking factors we have established in the past.  First, one or another ranking factor is relevant.  And after a while it does not increase the value of information in any way and it has to be lowered.  That‚Äôs why Google has ceased to take into account the factor of the number of links to an image from various web pages as significant, ‚Äùreports Google‚Äôs chief engineer on the blog. <br><br>  7. Focus on the freshness of search results.  As announced just over a week ago, Google made a bet on the relevance of the content, launching a new algorithm that will update the search results for 35% of the queries. <br><br>  8. Priority to the official pages in the issue of Google: as reported in the blog, Google is trying to provide users with the most relevant queries search results.  In this regard, search engine algorithms have learned to distinguish the official pages of sites from others.  Thus, official sites are assigned a higher rating. <br><br>  9. The ability for the user to set the time frame for the request: this innovation is a consequence of the orientation to the freshness of the results of the issue, in cases when the user chooses a certain period of time during the request.  Google search guarantees that the user will receive results that are as relevant as possible to the query, indicating a specific range of dates. <br><br>  10. Auto-completion of requests containing non-Latin characters: Google has learned to offer hints when entering requests containing non-Latin characters that are not on the keyboard. <br><br>  In addition, Matt Kats warns that this list of innovations is only a sample of hundreds of annual changes in the algorithms produced by Google. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132716/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132716/</a></p>
