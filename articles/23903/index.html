    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Purpose of the study</b> <br>  Find a program for playing video files (hereinafter: the player), which provides the optimal combination of the following characteristics: <br><ul><li>  maximum playback time when running on battery </li><li>  Support for both the latest and less recent video encoding formats and digital video distribution (* hhm * BitTorrent * hhm *) </li><li>  support for subtitles, including those embedded in containers (mkv, ogm) and with design (ssa, ass‚Ä¶ ugh-uhh-huhh, he said ‚Äúass‚Äù) </li><li>  no need to clog the system with a large number of codecs, assembled by someone unknown, unknown as well as unknown from what </li></ul><br>  <b>Hardware</b> <br><ul><li>  ASUS eeePC 701 (4G) in standard Eldorad configuration with a 4400 mAh battery.  The screen brightness is 11 of 16, the volume of the sound is 11 of 16. The WiFi controller is disabled. </li><li>  Headphones Koss PortaPro.  Under the pillow.  Because to listen to the same sounds from the speakers of the eepts for a whole week, you know, I do not feel like at all.  In addition, sometimes you still have to work. </li><li>  Transcend SDHC Class 6 8GB memory card, formatted in FAT32 </li></ul><br>  <b>Software</b> <br><ul><li>  Windows XP SP2 + <a href="http://tracker.ryanvm.net/detail%3Fid%3D115">RyanVM Update Pack 2.2.1</a> , cleaned up with <a href="http://nliteos.com/">nLite</a> </li><li>  Complete device drivers </li><li>  Player <a href="http://smplayer.berlios.de/index.php%3Ftr_lang%3Den">SMPlayer</a> versions 0.6.0rc3 - 0.6.0rc4 (the latest at the time of writing) </li><li>  A set of <a href="http://www.cccp-project.net/wiki/index.php%3Ftitle%3DMain_Page">CCCP</a> decoders version 2008-01-24 (the most recent at the time of writing) with included <a href="http://www.cccp-project.net/wiki/index.php%3Ftitle%3DMedia_Player_Classic">Media Player Classic</a> (MPC) and <a href="http://www.cccp-project.net/wiki/index.php%3Ftitle%3DZoom_Player">Zoom Player</a> players </li><li>  (To those who are used to other players: use what you want. But then do not complain that you were not <a href="http://www.cccp-project.net/wiki/index.php%3Ftitle%3DMedia_Players">warned</a> .) </li></ul><br>  <b>Test video files</b> (Name, Container, Video, Sound, Subtitle) <br><ul><li>  Kino no Tabi ep 06-13 (MKV / H264 704x480 (853: 480) / AAC / ASS embedded with design and fonts) </li><li>  Serial Experiments Lain ep 01-08 (OGM / DivX 5 640x480 / OGG / SRT embedded) </li><li>  Neon Genesis Evangelion ep 01-10 (AVI / XviD 1.0 512x384 / MP3 / without subtitles) </li><li>  Byousoku 5 Centimeter (MKV / H264 720x480 (853: 480) / AC3 ‚Äã‚Äã2ch, 4ch / without subtitles) </li><li>  Bender's Big Score (MP4 / H264 720x480 / MP3 / without subtitles) </li><li>  The Simpsons Movie (MKV / H264 720x416 / AAC / ASS embedded with artwork) </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Testing procedure</b> <br><br>  Simple as boots.  We unplug the charger, which is 100% charged, and start playing video files from the memory card on it.  We notice time.  Along the way, we can check the features of playback and CPU usage.  We are waiting for the playback to stop due to the exhaustion of the battery charge.  We notice time.  We strain the small gray cells and calculate the duration of play.  We set the charge to charge.  If necessary, we write another set of video files on the card.  Apply, rinse, repeat. <br><br>  <b>Shocking results</b> <br><br>  Suddenly, a 4400 mAh battery sucks.  More precisely, eptsovskiy Celeron, unaware of the power saving modes, sucks all the juices from a poor battery, which itself sucks.  Such is the unnatural union of two disabled since childhood.  In idle mode, that is, a very lonely move, when the screen and the ‚Äúhard disk‚Äù are legally forbidden to shut off completely, ecs pulls only 3 hours and 20 minutes. <br><br>  Zoom Player, included in the CCCP, I tested very little, because firstly, its <strike>uebansky</strike> extremely unusual (and extremely uncomfortable on the epec without an external mouse) control circuit and settings pushed me away from the first acquaintance, secondly, I would have to spend testing for another two days (and I‚Äôm already fed up with these sadly rhythmic gestures), and thirdly, tests showed that he was eating the battery only slightly less intensely than MPC, but more briskly than SMPlayer.  So in the stump of this center-right. <br><br>  The level of CPU usage by the player during the playback of H264 affects the battery life of the device rather slightly.  So, SMPlayer when loading H264 loads percents by one third, and sometimes almost half as much as FFDShow / MPC (40+ versus 60-80 +%), but only 10-15 of about 160 gains from this. , someone is comforted by the fact that he also warms up the scion even more, although in the conditions of the Russian winter this is probably a drawback. <br><br>  The duration of battery life epsa more influenced by the type of content being played.  For example, my old homemade Evangelion encode (deliberately without external subtitles, so as not to load the processor) that the one that the other players played back for almost 3 hours.  SMPlayer again won 10-15 minutes.  It is not surprising: the loading of the process did not go beyond 10% even in the most hectic places. <br><br>  A pleasant surprise turned out to be that the epec eats any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/480p">480p</a> content that he pushes, and practically does not choke at all.  Here it is necessary to note an important fact: SMPlayer still chokes more often than FFDShow / MPC, which rather smartly gently grunts slightly, throws up the download to 100%, passes a difficult moment and goes further.  SMPlayer in such places usually begins to just skip the frames, without straining the processor, the sloth.  Very clearly this behavior is noticeable in the very first moments of the Byousoku 5 Centimeter: there the image is panned from left to right, and at the same time in the frame the sakura petals slowly (at a speed of 5 cm / sec, from which the name of the picture) crumble, from the top down.  Running this movie in SMPlayer gives you a unique opportunity to look at this beauty through the eyes of a grandfather who suffers <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">from Parkinson's disease</a> .  Therefore, if you want to watch the latest releases in H264 and smoothness of playback for you is more important than 10-15 minutes of winning in autonomous work, I recommend to stop the choice on CCCP. <br><br>  <b>Useful tips</b> <br><br>  If you suddenly start to jerk and brake when playing offline video, which you did not have when connecting the power supply to the power grid, go to Control Panel -&gt; Power Options and on the very first tab <a href="http://www.orthogonalthought.com/blog/index.php/2007/09/intel-speedstep-windows-xp-and-confusing-power-profiles/">set Power Schemes to Portable / Laptop mode</a> .  And never again change it for anything.  Even on vodka.  Tell me, Kochegarov did not order. <br><br>  If, when the battery charge drops to 20-10%, jerks, brakes and hang-ups regularly begin, update BIOS to a more recent version (it is 0801 in Eldoepians, but you need at least 0906) and be happy with this <a href="http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D9104">handy thing</a> . <br><br>  Well, in general, be happy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23903/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23903/</a></p>
