An article in a magazine, a blog post does not take up so much of our time, and sometimes they bring no less benefit. <br><br>  Recently, I have learned to allocate time for reading, but unfortunately, not so much to read a fairly large book in one approach.  Therefore, I was puzzled by the note-taking of the read material on the go.  Thanks to modern technology, it is not a bit difficult.  While reading from a smart switch to OneNote and take notes, what could be easier? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, <i>‚ÄúThe myth of multitasking.</i>  <i>What does the desire to be in time for, ‚ÄùDave Crenshaw</i> . <br><br>  Multitasking is a lie, despite the fact that almost everyone in our rapidly developing world believed in the myth of its effectiveness.  We unconditionally accepted it as a way of life.  Many people are proud of the skills of multitasking, but in fact multitasking is not effective and not at all real.

Instead, there is a simple switch between tasks.  Most often it happens so quickly that you are not aware of this, but in fact during this entire shift in classes you jump from one thought to another. <br><br>  In economics, there is a concept - the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">cost of switching</a> .  As a rule, this principle concerns the cost of switching from one supplier to another.  In personal terms, the cost of switching has to be paid when people have to return several times and review what they have done before they can complete the task.  The more difficult the task ... the higher this cost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7dd/e69/3c5/7dde693c59604685a682a6569c4222a0.png" alt="quote5" align="right">  Some of the switches are initiated personally, and then they are called <i>active</i> .  All other switches can be considered <i>passive</i> .  They are initiated by someone (or something) by (a colleague with a question, notification of mail, incoming mobile call, etc.). <br><br>  Research results show that, on average, each person spends approximately 28 percent of his work day on interruptions and ineffective actions.  And the main reason for this, perhaps, is multitasking (or switching between tasks). <br><br>  When it comes to a senior official (CEO, owner), the percentage of wasted time increases.  There is a rule: the more responsibility, the greater the likelihood of inefficiency.  This rule is often called the law of switching between tasks. <br><br>  Confirmation of the low efficiency of the head, can serve as the situation in the company.  Vanity, confusion and mess - these are the first external signs of inefficiency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff1/8f6/ecf/ff18f6ecf312484e8a175517de74eb14.png" alt="quote1" align="right">  Initially, the word "multitasking" was not used at all in relation to people.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">This term</a> was unique to computers.  Thanks to some clever man, multitasking has become perceived as a normal phenomenon not only in the business world, but also in other matters, although this is not so. <br><br>  Meanwhile, there is another term describing the productive use of time when doing several things at the same time.  This process is called background task. <br><br>  The background task is the execution of two or more tasks simultaneously, in which only one of them requires mental effort (eating and watching television, jogging and listening to music).  Although switching between tasks is not a category of morality (‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù), it is always less efficiently focused activity or background task. <br><br>  As part of thinking about multitasking, there is another private and frequent myth.  ‚ÄúMen do not own multitasking, but for women it is a real way of life.  Women cope with multitasking much better than men. "  Familiar reasoning? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/542/58f/def/54258fdefd4c4366ac43d5c9e4d0d018.png" alt="quote7" align="right">  Indeed, many studies demonstrate that the brain chemistry of individuals, men and women, can vary significantly.  However, the same studies did not show any differences in multi-tasking.  Often the results of such studies are uncertain.  So the statements demonstrating the difference of the sexes in their ability to multitask are clearly insufficiently proven and openly stink of sexism. <br><br><h4>  Exercise, demonstrating not effective multitasking </h4><br>  Write the phrase "Multitasking is worse than a lie."  For each letter, you need to immediately write a number in the line below.  For example, start by writing the letter ‚Äúm‚Äù in the first line, and then in the second - the number ‚Äú1‚Äù.  Then in the first line write the letter "n", in the second - the number "2", that is, you must write the numbers in ascending order for each letter from the sentence "multitasking worse than lying." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c0/9c8/6a0/2c09c86a046a477891cc4faccc6d7215.png" alt="table1"><br><br>  The main condition, you need to switch to writing numbers after each letter of the sentence.  Watch the time and find out how long it will take to complete this exercise. <br><br>  After this, repeat the exercise, individually writing the text and numbers.  Watch out for time and compare. <br><br><h4>  Exercise table </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14c/d8e/d0a/14cd8ed0a6ec40c3a27f9ee4a3fede42.png" alt="table2"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19b/a81/bc9/19ba81bc95db4065b025d333901c85fd.png" alt="quote10" align="right">  There is another illusion that many people believe in - modern technology. <br><br>  Cell phones, e-mail, faxes, text messages and all the newest things - make us more productive in terms of information.  The truth is that these things can only make us productive if we learn to control them.  They are servants.  We are the masters.  If we do not plan our schedule ourselves and save our time, then we allow the flow of information to overwhelm ourselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66f/986/c7d/66f986c7d63e4af69b650779e42947f6.png" alt="quote9"><br><br><h4>  The steps you can take to stop switching between tasks: </h4><br><ul><li>  To realize that multitasking is a lie. </li><li>  Understand the difference between background tasks and switching between tasks. </li><li>  Find out the true distribution of your time week by week. </li><li>  Develop a new and realistic budget using your time week by week. </li><li>  Plan out regular meetings with your key employees. </li><li>  Set expectations and create personal ‚Äúwork hours‚Äù so that people can clearly know when you will be available to them. </li><li>  Resist active switching. </li><li>  Minimize all passive switches. </li><li>  Give all attention to the conversation with the staff. </li><li>  Plan more useful things while traveling between meetings. </li><li>  Never agree on anything without a diary at hand. </li></ul><br><br>  The structure of the book is presented in the form of a description of the case of consulting company executives.  Reading <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/5091565/" title="The book Myth about multitasking on the OZON">Dave Crenshaw‚Äôs book</a> won't take you long.  It took me about two hours.  For a more complete acquaintance with the author's ideas, I strongly recommend reading the original.  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289494/</a></p>
