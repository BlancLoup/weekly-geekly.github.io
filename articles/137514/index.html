Antivir help, of course, but the car is loaded, and the reliability of the response does not allow to relax.  But that's fine, viruses are external factors.  And the OS itself?  The winsxs section cannot be cleaned (I found only one half-working tool) it grows by 1 gig per month and its size due to solid links is a solid lie.  The registry is full of dirt from all sorts of left, half-left, and even very right programs.  And no one can clean it up qualitatively either. <br><br>  Once I realized that it would not be better, this is technology.  Regular cleaning does not help, antivirus silent.  I had to look for another way out.  About a year ago, the output was installed and tested.  Also, in general, technology is not limited to one action.  But once you set it up, you can really relax.  Nothing fundamentally new, I just had the patience to bring the matter to the end.  Next is a description. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Ideology: <br>  The system disk must be untouchable.  One solid "sandbox" with a return to the ideal when rebooting.  Those.  Any program does anything with the system, even though it is defrag, even though format c: / u / y.  But it is worth rebooting, or run the "rollback" and everything will come back.  This is the most significant moment, all the rest of the dance will be around him.  To implement there is a fair amount of programs, I personally, after several experiments, stopped at <a href="http://www.faronics.com/">DeepFreeze</a> , but there is also <a href="http://www.shadowdefender.com/">Shadow Defender</a> , <a href="http://www.comodo.com/home/backup-online-storage/data-recovery.php">Comodo TimeMachine</a> , etc.  On the board there is a comparison and a full <a href="http://forum.ru-board.com/topic.cgi%3Fforum%3D5%26topic%3D3799%26start%3D0">list</a> .

      So, you first need to completely reinstall the system.  And nothing else.  To ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù the system is not only enough to be clean, it would still be nice to clean and adjust it after installation, then it will be more difficult.  I have <a href="http://www.wintools.net/">WinTools</a> for this, but it's a matter of taste.  And so, we have a newborn system, fast as a car, with completely disabled unnecessary services (such as backup and updates), cleaned sheduler and all drivers. <br><br>  Further troubles begin.  Because  The system disk will be ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù, user profiles (Documents, Downloads, Settings) should be transferred to another.  I transfer the Users directory (for W7) entirely, it's easier.  Due to the large number of hardlinks inside it, regular copying does not work here.  It must be said that in W7 there wasn‚Äôt any tool at all for a complete copy of this kind, but others have it, though in the singular.  Called <a href="http://www.xxcopy.com/">xxcopy</a> .  And of course, this copying is possible only when booting from an external system.  USB flash drive, CD - no difference, just to be able to install and run "xxcopy c: \ Users d: \ Users / BU / SC" (BU is a backup / SC - copying ACL attributes noted by PaulZi). <br><br>  After this, it is necessary to explain to Windows that its profiles are in another place, i.e.  replace all entries of c: \ Users in the registry with d: \ Users.  Here too trabl.  Of all the registry editors that I have tried (more than 10), only <a href="http://www.torchsoft.com/node/9">Registry Workshop</a> does this in full and the profile really moves.  The rest, including the most fashionable and popular ones, do this work poorly and the old profile continues to be partially used.  I usually immediately after the replacement, rename c: \ Users to c: \ Userd_Old and check if W7 did not create it again after rebooting, then everything was done correctly.  This is a thin place, here you can easily bury a freshly installed system, but you don‚Äôt have to worry, no matter how you get the registry, you can roll back the changes and return the directory to the old place. <br><br>  The rest is a matter of technology.  It is necessary to roll on a clean operation all required for the life of the program, but with one remark.  Do not forget - the system disk will be ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù and it is better to immediately install some programs somewhere else.  I make myself a d: \ Programs directory and put everything I can - go there.  Exceptions are programs that require their own drivers, MSOfis (where, without him), firewall and antisped.  The rest is in d :.  This is not a dogma, everything can be saved on the c: \ disk, there are practically no programs that save their settings in the .ini files (which is a pity).  Firefox runs in my portable version with a cache on RAMDrive.  Opera and Chrome can be run exactly the same way (I use them only for debugging).  And in general - almost everything that is necessary in life, works in portable versions.  This and the system saves and recover easier, if that. <br><br>  And the last.  All Temp directories, both global and local user, are transferred to RAMDrive and faster and safer, a random malware after a reboot dies.  This is also not a dogma, just an extra touch.  Unfortunately, the only normal RAMDrive ( <a href="http://www.romexsoftware.com/en-us/index.html">VSUite</a> ) is paid, the rest, despite all the declarations, do not know how to dynamically increase memory. <br><br>  That's all.  The system is configured, the programs are installed, you can set and enable the "frieze".  I will add only that the system disk in this case does not need to be made large.  10 gigs is more than enough.  New programs can be installed and then - ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù is removed, the program is set, ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù is returned.  The main thing is not to sit for a long time with the frieze turned off, the garbage itself accumulates, and it cannot be removed. <br><br>  I have antivirus installed.  MCAfee Enterprize.  Catching cracks mostly.  On half of the machines in the office, there is no anti-virus at all, as the practice of infection attempts has shown that with such a system it rarely survives after a reboot, and if it survives, it is not blocked by the operating system and its body lies in an open and defenseless access buried somewhere profile. <br><br>  In conclusion.  Several machines made by this system I live since February last year.  Everything is as beautiful and clean as it was then.  Yes, users had to explain with blood in half that the root of the disk c: \ is not the place where it is convenient to fold pictures.  After losing a couple of files it got to them.  Yes, updates have to roll manually.  But now I'm resting.  A lot and with benefit.  Here, even the article time was found. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137514/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137514/</a></p>
