  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Euroset - consultants just oh ... fuck!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Of course, I understand that consultants in Euroset are paid little.  Therefore, including they rarely understand the technique sold and are often mistaken in the characteristics of the devices.  I understand that their publicly idle galloping crowd got stuck, that they are constantly asked to see something and rarely buy it.  But what happened today, I was just outraged to the depths of the soul! <br>  So, I wanted to give my mother a birthday phone.  She is already an elderly woman, so the requirements are specific to the phone.  You need a clamshell or a slider, while the screen resolution is not very high (so that the font is bigger), the presence of mp3 (put songs on the call) and a poor camera (take pictures of grandchildren).  Well, so that the battery worked longer. <br>  I started shopping in the week.  I went to Euroset.  At first, I barely questioned the boy to stop the fascinating conversation and came up to me.  Then I had to literally beg to show the phone!  At my request to show, at first he tried to get off with a verbal description, then he gave to hold the phone with the battery pulled out.  What kind of suffering was on his face when I once again reminded him that I still want to see the screen, the menu and listen to the speaker.  What was the grimace and what a heavy sigh. <br>  In principle, I liked everything in that phone (it was Nokia 2760), but you have to choose.  I went to the shop window and asked to show Xenium (such a pretty red clamshell, I did not remember the model).  In the description was listed mp3.  He, having already managed to go to his corner, muttered from there that there was no mp3.  He told me the same thing about some inexpensive Sagem or Fly (I don‚Äôt remember already).  Disappointed, I went home. <br>  Today I decided to pass the waiting time in another Euroset - and there, too, the descriptions did not correspond to reality.  But at the same time, I remembered my sad experience when I was vparivali about the headset is not at all what it was when they were grossly mistaken in the characteristics of the phone.  And I asked the consultant whether there really is an mp3 in this Xenium.  Unfortunately, it was the same boy!  He stood in a pose and indignantly said that they had already explained everything to me a few days ago!  Well, not arrogance, eh? <br>  I asked him why you, knowing that there is a mistake in the description, cannot correct it ??  And in general, what right do you have to resent because of your laziness? <br>  I can't spoil the mood because of such stagnancy, but the desire to buy something from Euroset has disappeared!  Do not wait, Mr. Chichvarkin, a bright future, if the level of service will be so soviet! <br>  PS And this is happening not only in Euroset, but also in other salons of communication, appliance stores, cosmetics, furniture! <br>  PPS The title is a parody of one of the Euroset slogans.  Itself in many ways hypocritical and negative attitude to the foul language.  Therefore, if he touched someone, I apologize.  I wrote a post under the influence of indignation, now I would change the title, but too late. </div>
