Even in these difficult times, most retailers are not willing to change not only morally, but also economically outdated business strategies.  Intel, as one of the largest innovators in the world, plans to move the ship from the ground with the help of a cash register concept that not only knows who you are, but also what you need. <br><br>  The prototype, which was presented to the public on Monday at the <a href="http://www.nrf.com/">National Retail Federation Show</a> in New York, aims to change the style with which, until recently, purchases were made.  Now recommendations come into force, in the best traditions of online stores. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://blog.wired.com/photos/uncategorized/2009/01/12/pos_side_context.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But even despite the fact that Intel is satisfied with the concept, the company is not going to enter the world of retail, and the prototype (at least this one) will not get on the production line.  For the reason that this cash register was originally created to demonstrate the capabilities of new processors, which, in principle, translate the idea into the category of product.  ‚ÄúWe wanted to show the future,‚Äù says Ryan Parker from Intel‚Äôs Embedded Computing: ‚ÄúBut people don‚Äôt really like looking at motherboards.‚Äù

      In order to wrap all the silicon, plastic and wires in a pleasant look for a potential buyer, the guys turned to Frog Design, a studio from San Francisco known not only for end products ( <a href="http://images.google.ru/images%3Fhl%3Dru%26newwindow%3D1%26rlz%3D1B3GGGL_ruCZ301CZ302%26q%3DApple%2520II%26lr%3D%26um%3D1%26ie%3DUTF-8%26sa%3DN%26tab%3Dwi">Apple II</a> ), but also for interfaces ( <a href="http://dell.com/">Dell</a> ).  In Frog, they looked at the design of the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù cash registers (which were outdated by at least 5 years) with horror and, having slightly scolded, presented the casing for the Intel machine, consisting of three touchscreen screens, built into the aluminum altar of shopping. <br><br>  Two vertical monitors play the role of an information kiosk, where advertising is shown.  But it is worthwhile for the buyer to hold over, forgive, my God, the ‚Äútable‚Äù card of the store with the RFID tag, how the entire history of purchases will come out, along with recommendations on what could be purchased today.  When all the necessary manipulations are done, the seller turns on the horizontally located monitor with his employee badge, where all the purchases will be displayed separately.  After that, it remains only to discuss what needs to be discussed with the seller, pay the money and pick up the goods. <br><br>  In addition, Intel preoccupied with the power consumption of such a machine: it uses LCD monitors, portable processors, but, more importantly, a similar cash register goes into sleep mode as soon as the seller leaves the RFID scanning zone.  This means that if you happen to work in the Apple / H &amp; M / BestBuy department in five or seven years, going out "on a cigarette" with a colleague, you will not have to worry that the schoolchildren will do something with the expensive device. <br><br>  via <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/01/intel-cash-regi.html">Wired</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49005/</a></p>
