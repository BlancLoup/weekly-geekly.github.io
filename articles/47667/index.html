These are my principles of crisis internet marketing.  I will write briefly, so as not to take a lot of time, who are interested in a detailed article, it is on my <a href="http://www.web-analytic.ru/2008/11/09/antikrizisnyj-internet-marketing/">blog</a> . <br><br><h4>  <b>Principle 1: Optimize, not reduce.</b> </h4><br>  Why does marketing need optimization? <br>  <i>First of all,</i> <a name="habracut"></a>  Now the situation has changed, and those advertising techniques that were developed before the crisis, now may not work as effectively.  On the other hand, thanks to the crisis, there are new opportunities for your marketing that you can use. <br>  <i>Secondly, in</i> order for a business to survive, it is necessary to maximally squeeze profits from all sources.  And to ensure maximum profit, advertising campaigns must be as effective as possible.  For this you need a competent assessment and a constant search for working techniques. <br>  <i>Thirdly</i> , in the face of reduced costs, the advertising campaign should work correctly.  Because every mistake leads to a loss of investment.  Every ruble spent should be profitable.  In order to avoid mistakes and not lose money, you need to constantly check the quality of the advertising.  That is, properly evaluate its result. <br><br><h4>  <b>Principle 2: Take only the essence.</b> </h4><br>  Competent assessment of advertising campaigns is the key to success during a crisis.  It is important to measure only those indicators that really affect the profit, or an understanding of how to extract it.  The size of the traffic, the reach of the audience, the frequency of contact, the position of the site, now all this is secondary.  It is only important that can be expressed by the amount of profit.  You need to clearly see what works for profit and what doesn't.  The only way you will calculate the real effectiveness of Internet marketing.

    <h4>  <b>Principle 3: Act Right Now!</b> </h4><br>  Now the economy is undergoing serious changes, the impact of which on business is inevitable.  And the further, the more it will be felt.  To get out of the crisis as a winner, you need to act right now, while you still have the opportunities and resources, and the population has money :) <br>  There are fewer opportunities, using which you can make a long time profit.  As soon as there is a clue or an idea, you should immediately use it. <br><br>  These are the basic principles of crisis internet marketing.  How to apply them on your website?  Here are brief instructions on how to get started: <br><br>  <b>Optimize online advertising</b> <br><ul><li>  Review all the text ads and banners, they are also attractive in a crisis? </li><li>  In contextual advertising, check all keywords, and leave only those that lead customers, not visitors. </li><li>  Optimize ad text and landing pages based on their conversion rate. </li></ul><br>  <b>Optimize SEO</b> <br>  Based on the analysis of search traffic on your site, highlight the keywords that lead customers.  And use them in search engine optimization. <br><br>  <b>Properly organize the website</b> <br><ul><li>  Calculate the traffic paths of visitors to your site that lead to conversions.  Identify and eliminate problems that occur along these lines. </li><li>  Analyze the quality of navigation on the site, and in case of problems, take measures to eliminate them. </li><li>  Develop your site according to the real needs of your audience. </li></ul>  As a result, the loyalty of visitors to your site will increase, and with it the level of conversion. <br><br>  <b>Track your email marketing</b> <br>  Determine the real effectiveness of sending your business proposals, directories, etc.  Measure the conversion rate for all types of mailings, close the useless and develop effective ones.  Optimize the newsletter material based on what pages of your site are viewed by visitors who come from the newsletters. <br><br>  <b>Properly place advertising banners or links to other sites</b> <br><ul><li>  If you place banners or links to attract traffic, you should analyze its quality.  Leave only those placements that bring the maximum customers, and remove the rest. </li><li>  Analyze how the content and placement of banners / links affect the number of clients.  Make the necessary changes. </li><li>  Properly choose new platforms for placement, based on the quality of their audience. </li></ul>  The key to a successful site is the constant monitoring of its work.
