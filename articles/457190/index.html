  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We treat business through the introduction of a CRM system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tt/ih/l_/ttihl_m0spiedg8yiqruitlf9mo.jpeg" width="300"></div><br>  The introduction of a CRM system allows you to reduce the amount of managerial work by 28%, which saves 8-12 working hours per week.  The cost-effectiveness of implementing a CRM system is 5-15% of the company's total turnover, while the percentage of customer retention increases by 5-7%.  All this allows you to increase business profits by 25-50%. <br><br>  Business executives often perceive CRM as a kind of miracle pill or medicine that allows you to increase profits three times.  But in fact, everything happens a little differently.  And the very introduction of a CRM system is rather similar to a detailed course of treatment, which brings results not immediately and gradually. <br><br>  Therefore, we would like to talk about the integration process of CRM on the example of classical medical therapy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Stage one: history and diagnosis </h3><br>  The first stage is one of the most difficult.  First of all, you should determine the purpose of the implementation of CRM systems.  For the patient, the main goal is to get rid of the disease. 
      <br>

      The goal of a company director can be very different: identifying problem areas, structuring business, automating work processes, monitoring performance, etc.  In order to track the result of the implementation of a CRM system, it is necessary to determine which tasks it should solve. <br><br>  After listening to complaints and identifying symptoms, the doctor examines the patient's history and prescribes various tests.  In our context, the CRM implementation specialist will have to understand the work scheme of the entire company.  To do this, you must define the following: <br><br><ul><li>  Structure.  The number of employees, the hierarchy and the tasks they perform. </li><li>  The main products or service that the company offers (as well as the main sales channels). </li><li>  The target audience. </li><li>  How is the deal.  It is necessary to determine all the work that is performed in conjunction ‚Äúbid-sell-sell-sell‚Äù. </li><li>  Marketing.  As the company builds relationships with customers, it also distributes its product. </li><li>  How is the performance analysis of employees, department or the entire company.  What tools are used for this? </li></ul><br>  In fact, the specialist performs an external audit of the enterprise in order to identify problem areas, work tools, personnel structure, etc.  It should be borne in mind that companies often do not want to provide detailed data and insist that the specialist independently carry out the analysis.  But remember that the doctor will not be able to diagnose without the participation of the patient. <br><br><h3>  Stage Two: Treatment Plan </h3><br>  At this stage of implementing the CRM system, the specialist has already determined where the company is losing money.  He sees at what stage the deal breaks down;  how many customers refuse to make a repeat purchase and why;  which employees violate deadlines, etc.  On the basis of these data, the Terms of Reference are compiled and the most suitable structure of the CRM system is formed. <br><blockquote>  Many companies offer gamification, integration services, various widgets and more.  But most often the excess functionality has a negative effect.  The more CRM is loaded, the harder it is to work in it. </blockquote>  Once the basic structure of the CRM is created, you can evaluate its benefits and start testing.  Usually it does not take much time, but it allows you to get rid of most of the problems that may appear in the work. <br><br>  Immediately after this, it is necessary to carry out the transfer of information to CRM.  Over time, the data will certainly be edited and modified.  Therefore, it is very important to determine who exactly will administer the new system and track changes.  Usually such is the head of the department or his deputy. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cz/tf/zh/cztfzhpc_tq7tfqkf7btkaqyfse.jpeg" width="300"></div><br><h3>  Stage Three: Start Treatment With Tracking Results </h3><br>  To convince colleagues to get rid of Excel spreadsheets, you need to show them the value and simplicity of working with the system.  For example, to save the history of communication with the client, the manager needs to make a few clicks.  And to share information, you just need to select the appropriate names of colleagues from the list.  This simplification eliminates the routine work, and that is what is needed to bring to the staff. <br><br>  Users will have questions about working with the system, so the first weeks the technical support manager gives recommendations on the work.  Also, this can be done by the head of the department at the enterprise where CRM is being implemented. <br><br>  The effectiveness of the implementation of the CRM system depends on the speed of implementation.  If the platform is introduced immediately to all divisions and in all directions, then the management simply will not understand how to organize the work. <br><br>  It is as if the patient immediately prescribed 5 tablets of vitamin C, antibiotics, drip, injections, physiotherapy and walks in the fresh air.  The course of treatment, as well as the introduction of CRM, it is best to start gradually on each unit or individual team. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zn/ni/ew/znniewh9hy71_ylnlneg6jz_8s4.jpeg" width="300"></div><br><h3>  Stage Four: Fighting Side Effects </h3><br>  As in any new project, when you start CRM you encounter difficulties and side effects from the ‚Äútreatment‚Äù.  The most basic of them are: <br><br>  <i>1. The staff does not want to work with CRM, ignores it and works in standard tables.</i> <br><br>  To eliminate the side effect, you do not need to impose sanctions, but you should think up motivation and rewards for using CRM.  For example, for 10 developed contacts in CRM, you can offer a free lunch in the dining room or 10 minutes for a lunch break. <br><br>  <i>2. Managers do not understand the logic of CRM and the need for its implementation.</i> <br><br>  Often the staff is sure that no changes are needed to the company.  Also say patients who do not want to spend money on drugs and go to the pharmacy: ‚ÄúWhy do I need these cold pills?  I'll get better in chicken broth. ‚Äù <br><br>  Therefore, employees need to convey information that the introduction of CRM increases profits despite all doubts.  And the sooner the effect of the novelty is, the faster the company will grow, and consequently the salary of managers. <br><br>  <i>3. It is hard to learn ...</i> <br><br>  The stages of implementing a CRM system involve the integration of additional tools.  This increases the efficiency of managers, only they do not even know about it.  Therefore, new interesting features in the system should be studied and used by employees.  A specialist in technical support or a manager can help in the study of new tools. <br><br>  <i>4. Distribution of duties.</i> <br><br>  Companies are faced with a problem when employees cannot or do not want to distribute tasks: one considers that he is doing something in CRM more, the other one thinks the same way. <br><br>  Such a conflict of interest may extend to entire departments.  In this case, the regulator (manager or technical specialist) will help to resolve the conflict, which will reveal the reason and, possibly, add a new feature to automate or simplify any processes. <br><br>  <i>5. Sudden allergy.</i> <br><br>  During treatment, the patient may have a hidden allergy to the drug.  In the context of the company, this means that during the data transfer, the working jambs that were admitted earlier emerge.  For example, the contact of an important client was lost in the dump Excel files.  Bottom line: a broken deal. <br><blockquote>  Usually in such a case helps the enterprise audit.  A person engaged in the implementation of CRM can simultaneously engage in auditing and identify key issues.  Subsequently, all identified errors are resolved by the team or individual managers. </blockquote><br><h3>  Stage Five: Gradual Recovery </h3><br>  All the risks are over, the process of making deals is getting better and managers are gradually realizing how comfortable and faster it is to work in a new CRM.  Employees are beginning to understand that the new system was introduced not just for show or at the whim of the boss. <br><br>  The system displays all data on the client, so you no longer need to go to another department for information.  Through the mobile application, you can see how the best managers make a deal and learn from them.  It‚Äôs much easier to create promotions based on a client‚Äôs completed card.  Such benefits appear like mushrooms after rain. <br><br>  A good CRM seasoned with a bonus system can improve the efficiency of even weak managers.  Flexible employees, ready for change, will do the job even better.  Those who do not want to change and strive to increase sales will simply not be able to compete for their jobs. <br><br>  Right now, the company has a ‚Äúsecond wind‚Äù, with each month the gross turnover gradually increases, the gaps are identified and promptly eliminated, and employees begin to work as a single organism. <br><br>  Congratulations!  Your business is completely healthy and ready for new achievements. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wg/yj/px/wgyjpxytnhovm92ta0hm25i9_88.jpeg" width="300"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457190/</a></p>
