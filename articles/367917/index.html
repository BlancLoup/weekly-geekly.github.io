      <b>First impressions</b> <br><br>  The tablet seems even too thin and light for its size (in principle, it is the thinnest and lightest of ten-inch tablets).  When you take it in hand, you expect to feel a little more weight than it actually is.  And it is pleasantly surprising, I must admit.  The case is made of pleasant matte plastic - from the same as the miniature predecessor - Z3 Tablet Compact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aea/a13/682/aeaa136825124b24801f9f3ae2f851c4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fbd/3da/a40/fbd3daa4000a49dc9ea0c212fde5c1cf.jpg"><br><br>  In contrast to the latter, the ‚Äúelder brother‚Äù, nevertheless, is intended for horizontal use, therefore, a few controls are arranged accordingly.  Already a classic large round unlock button located on the left side, next to it is conveniently located volume control.  On the upper side there is a headset jack, as well as SIM-card slots and micro-SD flash drives covered with a cap.  The micro-USB connector is located on the right side (exactly in the center) and now doesn‚Äôt need a plug, like a headphone jack, being waterproof.  Thus, the number of stubs is reduced to one, and not so often opened.  In principle, if you install a large memory card and use mainly cloud services or transferring data via USB / OTG, then you can not open this single stub at all.  Threats to waterproofing become even less!  Magnetic charging connector eliminated as unnecessary. <br><br>  The back wall, covered, as already mentioned, with a matte plastic, contains a camera eye (without a flash) and, in principle, nothing more.  Despite the small thickness, the device is quite resistant to bending and looks very durable, we did not dare to assess the resistance to falls, and we do not recommend it to you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0f/f30/48e/a0ff3048ea174e58b5e5c6fb8f37c0cf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/804/aee/441/804aee4419c34ab4bff4267c4b8ac0c6.jpg"><br><br>  When you first turn on, as usual, we are offered to connect to the wireless network, log into the Google account, and if you already have, for example, a Sony smartphone (and not only Sony), you can transfer the basic settings from it using NFC, it‚Äôs enough to attach one device to another and wait a bit (well, enter a login with a password to avoid abuse). <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br><br>  Just say: the screen is impressive!  Density and sharpness of the image is simply incredible, and pixilezation cannot be noticed even if you try very hard.  The resolution of 2560x1440 at ten inches is a lot, not to mention the excellent color rendition and not less magnificent viewing angles - the IPS matrix allows you to see the image without any fading in any tilt.  Brightness is enough with a margin, so you can not set it to the maximum, and complete with anti-reflective coating allows you to comfortably use the device even in bright sunlight.  The color rendition (coverage is 97% of the sRGB palette, which is a very serious level) is very convincing and natural, without kinks and ‚Äúacidic‚Äù shades; moreover, if you are not satisfied with something, you can manually adjust the color scheme.  Already many publications deservedly called the screen Z4 Tablet best in class and it is difficult to disagree with this statement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d15/e36/900/d15e3690035d4dd4b9812f9c2a181da0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce8/03a/b0a/ce803ab0adad4112b4f3d93d6b9627fc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br>  Sony's tablets are traditionally equipped with modest, but very high-quality, 8-megapixel Exmor RS cameras, which should be well known to long-time users of Xperia smartphones.  As usual, the software responsible for the camera has both automatic and manual modes with the ability to select shooting conditions or self-adjust exposure, white balance, focusing and metering modes.  The camera starts almost instantly and no brakes are observed when shooting.  LED flash is absent, and the need for it is small.  But more attention is paid to the front camera, which is used for video communication and shooting self-portraits - here it is five-megapixel, with low noise, as well as various modes of image enhancement like Soft Skin.  Examples of images you can find below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/e1f/014/bdee1f014db74d17a0d0121965685fa0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16f/c35/ced/16fc35ced84a42ed89f41ee1af0e7386.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ce/9cd/33e/6ce9cd33eb1d4084b3609a3e20852a2a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/290/78e/883/29078e8839c243a49713a5c6d1b85206.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f2/814/018/1f2814018cb74260a7e5c63017fe3598.jpg"><br><br>  The front camera, like the new flagship smartphone Xperia Z3 + (as well as the Xperia C4 self-released not so long ago) became wide-angle and five-megapixel, acquired an LED flash and learned to shoot Full HD video, so now the front-camera does not only with video calls, but also with self portraits. <br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br><br>  Z4 Tablet can be called one of the loudest tablets, at least in its category.  Despite the moisture protection, which, as a rule, negatively affects the sound, the stereo speakers of the Z4 Tablet provide a very clear and clear sound, and the volume margin is enough in excess, so that you can not expose it to the maximum. <br><br>  The device supports music in the Hi-Res Audio format and, thanks to LDAX technology, allows you to play it not only through regular headphones and headsets, but also to transfer to bluetooth devices.  For those who prefer regular mp3 files, DSEE-HX technology is provided, improving the sound quality of compressed audio by restoring deleted frequencies.  Not without traditional improvers like the integrated ClearAudio +, which combines a compressor, an exciter and a stereo base expander.  There is also a realistic surround sound playback through the speakers, a dynamic track volume normalizer, as well as an active noise cancellation mode when using the appropriate headset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1a/220/af7/d1a220af7aef45098e6f64133e16648c.jpg"><br><br>  There are also no complaints about the sound in the headphones - both powerful bass and medium and high frequencies are in place, but to use the tablet as a wearable audio player in your bag you can use any of the wireless headsets, for example - Sony SBH70 <br><br>  <b>Iron and performance</b> <br><br>  Despite the fact that the eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 is blamed for overheating, in the case of the Xperia Z4 Tablet there is no such problem as with everyday use for surfing the web, reading and chatting, or when watching high-definition video. the launch of "voracious" games.  In addition to the processor from Qualcomm, the powerful Adreno 430 video accelerator with the support of 3 gigabytes of RAM is responsible for the performance. <br><br>  The tablet, of course, heats up under heavy load, but it is quite tolerant and it does not affect its work at all.  Games with complex resource-intensive graphics, such as the Asphalt and Need for Speed ‚Äã‚Äãseries, worked on the tablet without the slightest problem, without leading to strong heating and certainly without stopping applications and reducing FPS. <br><br>  <b>Connection</b> <br><br>  The model with LTE support can be used not only to connect to the Internet, but also for phone calls, the dialer application is the same as on smartphones, and you can use both speakers and a headset to talk.  No complaints about the quality of the connection did not arise, well, navigation, as usual, is beyond praise.  Also worth noting is that the Z4 Tablet supports LTE Cat6. <br><br>  <b>Autonomy</b> <br><br>  The battery capacity is 6000 mAh, that is, despite the decrease in the thickness of the case, they did not save on the battery and it remained the same as in the more ‚Äúplump‚Äù Z2 Tablet.  With a maximum load (that is, with a fully lightened screen brightness, active connections and a noticeable load on the hardware, the device can continuously work for a little over 6 hours, well, in normal mode, the charge lasts for 2-3 days, and the familiar STAMINA mode can significantly extend this time. <br><br>  <b>Soft</b> <br><br>  The tablet comes with a pre-installed Android 5.0 and the traditional Sony branded shell, about the updated version of which we were told some time ago.  A set of pre-installed applications, at the moment, includes the traditional Office Suite, AVG antivirus, Garmin navigator, as well as a video editor, file manager and other useful things.  Like the Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, the new tablet is tightly integrated with the Sony Playstation 4 and can be used as an additional (or main) screen for the game. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  Incredibly light and thin tablet top category with impressive performance, excellent screen, clear loud sound and very good autonomy.  If your work does not have a tight binding to the operating system, the Z4 Tablet can quite successfully become a substitute for a traditional laptop, especially if you use the removable Sony BKB50 keyboard (which even has a familiar touchpad) or the stand with an adjustable angle of inclination SCR32. <br><br>  <b>Characteristics</b> : <br>  <b>Processor</b> : Snapdragon 810 (8 cores 1.5 and 2.0 GHz) <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 3 GB RAM, 32 GB internal, SD card slot <br>  <b>Video</b> : Adreno 430 <br>  <b>Camera</b> : main 8 megapixel, front 5 megapixel, wide-angle lens <br>  <b>Display</b> : 10.1 ‚Äù, IPS, 2560 x 1600 <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 6000 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions</b> : 167 x 254 x 6.1 mm, 389 g <br>  <b>Platform</b> : Android 5.0 <br>  <b>Protection</b> : IP68 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367917/</a></p>
