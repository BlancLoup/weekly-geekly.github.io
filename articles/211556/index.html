In what cases to rely on, trying to figure out Braden Kowitz, Design Partner of Google Ventures. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/design_rendering_intent/">Design is the Rendering of Intent</a></strong> <br>  By examining two cases of design of US government sites (one with a good, and the second with a weak level of usability), Jared Spool comes to a deadly simple conclusion: "Design is a reflection of the real priorities of the product team." (Realization of real intentions) If the design is in priority, then It turns out most often at the level.  If the priority is simply to release the product on time, then it turns out that it turns out.  Continuing the theme: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.peterme.com/2014/01/02/spools-design-is-the-rendering-of-intent-and-the-double-diamond/">Peter Merholz develops the theme</a> by tying "design, as the realization of intentions" to the theory of "double design diamond."  The first diamond is the work on the product idea, the second is the realization of intentions.  Often, food teams miss work on the first part, taking everything for granted.  And start to implement, without having a clear vision. </li><li>  Marc Retting that <a href="http://www.marcrettig.com/intention-and-conversation/">intentions are the heart of the design</a> . </li><li>  According to Jake Solomon, the <a href="https://medium.com/p/47434acb50a8">main problem of the quality of state sites and services provided by the state is disregard for users</a> - the recipients of those services, which is manifested in countless examples.
