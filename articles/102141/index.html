The main thing when applying these, or any other assessments, is not to get carried away, otherwise the effect will be the opposite.

      1. Fewer mistakes - more efficient worker <br>  This postulate puts forward the idea: a programmer who does not make mistakes (extrapolation of a requirement is less than errors) is beneficial to the company.  To tell you who makes no mistakes?  (Well, if you're interested, <a href="http://aforism.nnov.ru/%3Fowner%3D%25D2%25E5%25EE%25E4%25EE%25F0%2520%25E4%25E5%2520%25C1%25E0%25ED%25E2%25E8%25E9">here</a> ). <br>  Now, let's look from an economic point of view.  For example, as developers, you implement a method for uploading a file to a web server.  You checked the basic things: loading an empty file, loading a small file, loading a file a little more.  And transferred to the testing department.  Where a testing specialist checked how a form loads a 2 GB file.  He checks on channels 10 Mb / s, 2 Mb / s, 1 Mb / s, 0.5 Mb / s.  Tell how long it will take?  And add to this a check of communication breaks, working off the storage overflow, and much more.  Why am I doing this?  Yes, all that you pay the programmer is 2-3 times more for testing, than the person responsible only for testing.  Yes, the programmer should conduct testing using the ‚Äúwhite box‚Äù method!  But a programmer who crosses reasonable boundaries in this matter is evil.  By the way, this is also remembered [1].  Well, in conclusion, as soon as you start paying the programmer for the fact that he has few errors, he will agree with the tester, and they will share the premium. <br><br>  2. Idea generators are many times more efficient than consumers of ideas. <br>  Here, it is even a shame to answer ... Here‚Äôs how it seems to you who is better for your company, a person who generates 100 ideas per hour, lights up them, carries them along ... But also quickly cools down and spreads to the next idea.  Or an employee who generates a year may be one worthwhile idea, but bringing it to realization. <br>  Well, ‚ÄúBecause they are interested in reinventing bicycles, and in no case should they take this opportunity away.  "- I don‚Äôt even know ... In the university, in the research center, in the testing department ... But the developer inventing bicycles in a commercial project is, in most cases, evil.  [2] <br><br>  3. The more abstract thinking, the more effective the employee. <br>  I met ‚Äúarchitects‚Äù a couple of times, transforming a simple abstraction from two levels of inheritance into a hierarchy of level classes for 5-7.  And you really need it?  I recommend reading [3]. <br><br>  4. The effectiveness of the employee is directly proportional to his self-motivation. <br>  Here I agree with self-motivation.  This is the motivation that requires to grow further.  But with the conclusion about where to work ... I fundamentally disagree.  The man "aggressive", according to the author, seeks to work in a startup.  After all, everyone reading this article seeks to broaden their horizons, to get new ideas that may be contrary to your beliefs (i.e., self-motivated), but ... You have two sentences before you: work in a startup you are required to develop it MySql + Php) and in Intel (compiler development for a parallel programming language).  Whose offer will you accept?  As another example, how a company with the letter G raises the level of self-motivation of its employees, present and future - [4]. <br><br>  5. The faster employees perform code refinement, the more effective they are. <br>  +1 <br><br>  Well, in conclusion: <br>  Each person has a certain outlook.  When this outlook narrows to infinitely small - it turns into a point.  It is then that a person begins to say that this is his ‚Äúpoint of view‚Äù.  Edwin Gilbert <br><br>  So read, compare, and make your decision, even if it turns out to be not always correct.  Have a nice day, and effective programmers in colleagues and subordinates. <br><br>  References <br>  1. <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/victor435/" class="user_link">Victor435</a> .  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/testing/45759/">Software testing: how to explain to a manager that 2 x 2 = 4?</a> <br>  2. <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/highoctane/" class="user_link">HighOctane</a> .  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/100959/">Ten tips for novice programmers</a> advice number 6 <br>  3. <a href="http://local.joelonsoftware.com/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5_%25D0%2590%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC_%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%258B_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">Joel Spolsky.</a>  <a href="http://local.joelonsoftware.com/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5_%25D0%2590%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC_%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%258B_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">Don't let Astronauts of Architecture scare you</a> <br>  4. <a href="http://kitya.livejournal.com/188574.html">http://kitya.livejournal.com/188574.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102141/</a></p>
