  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Logitech - the best warranty service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In any business, goods are divided into categories: lower class, middle class and premium class.  If we bring such a gradation to the peripheral equipment, or rather to the mice, we can already distinguish representatives of the premium class: Razer, Logitech, Roccat, S &amp; S and, in part, Microsoft. <br><br>  Recently, Razer announced a new gaming mouse, Raizer Taipan, which delivers an amazing 8400 dpi and holds acceleration to 4G.  A rather specific device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c23/96b/b0c/c2396bb0c1fef1a4df4b77daef3166ba.png">

      But if you look at the cost of this device, most users might be surprised - 79.99 Euros.  And if we consider that there are analogues for $ 15 from A4-Tech and Gigabyte, the question arises: ‚ÄúWhat do people pay for when they buy premium class equipment?‚Äù. <br><br>  I offer you my answer: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Sometimes there are very funny situations that show the real service. <br>  About three years ago I bought a Logitech G5 laser mouse from a large computer company.  I was given a one year warranty on it.  In general, I was pleased, but not everything was so rosy. <br><br>  After about two years of use, when I lost my vigilance, my cat crept up to the computer and snatched on the cord with its paw.  After my "grief" he ran away, but the wire of the mouse was damaged.  This led to the fact that the mouse is working, then turned off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c4/65e/e3d/4c465ee3d49168e02a0032f669f53b03.jpg"><br><br>  Having come to terms with the loss, I climbed to the official site of Logitech in search of a new mouse, but I was embarrassed by the phrase that they give a three-year warranty on their products.  I was told in the computer store: ‚ÄúMechanical damage is not a warranty case,‚Äù is quite adequate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c7/017/c18/2c7017c18638c3eb41b9df0509b3c1c1.jpg"><br><br>  However, I wrote to the support service, described the whole situation, though I added a bit of drama that the cat was electrocuted and his baleen feelings were hurt.  Five hours later, I received an answer asking me to photograph the mouse number on the background of a white sheet with the ticket number.  A day later, I received an answer that they regret what had happened and offered to replace my mouse with a new Logitech G500 model.  The limitation was the delivery in Moscow. <br><br>  I arranged with the Moscow online store to get my mouse, I pay for the delivery, and they send the mouse to me to the Far East.  A week later, I got a mouse.  However, this is not the end of the story. <br><br>  A mouse was sent with a marriage; when stopped, the cursor continued to move a couple of pixels up and went to the right.  I wrote again to the Logitech support team.  This time, of course, our conversation on the issue lasted a little longer.  I had to test the mouse on several types of surfaces, blow it with a vacuum cleaner.  But the defect remained there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b6/cf5/1fc/7b6cf51fcc19651a4ab7643ac798f8be.jpg"><br><br>  Two weeks later, I received another Logitech G500 mouse.  In fact, due to my mistake, Logitech reimbursed me two mice of the new model.  I have never met such a User-friendly company that keeps the bar of service. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147176/</a></p>
