Some products from its shelves could already touch and crush the visitors of <a href="http://andrstore.com/blog/andrstore-pobival-na-google-developers-day-2010/">Google Developers Day 2010 in Moscow</a> .  And one of the plush androids even went in the arms of Reto Meier with a diplomatic mission to his overseas counterparts.  But let's not get too far ahead and start from where it follows. <br><br><h4>  Start </h4><br>  From a great desire to get a green robot, the idea arose to open its online store of souvenir paraphernalia of Android OS.  We immediately agreed that buying there cheaply and selling expensive here is not our way.  Instead, it was decided to change the world around them with their own hands.  But I also didn‚Äôt want to create another service for printing T-shirts and scarves with dull drawings.  It was necessary to have something new, interesting and moderately functional, and ideally suitable for both boys and girls.  Therefore, we stopped at a pillow-toy, which can both decorate the interior and clearly stand out among the huge collection of monotonous plush, and also contribute to the quality and long-lasting viewing of dreams.  We were guided by the same logic when we invented a key chain, which not only can not be replaced, but should also please and warm the soul of its owner.  Of course, it‚Äôs not our fad to sew and make figures, so it was necessary to find capable assistants. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Job </h4><br>  The first in line was a plush android.  For its production it was necessary to agree with the garment factory, the search for which we have begun.  Connections, social networks and catalogs of Russian manufacturers went to the course.  A few days later, work was already under way on the first samples under our watchful control.  Soon they agreed on the design, purchased fabric, a synthetic winterizer, and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DixzhgsY6lQY">conveyor</a> began its work.  The first copies were born in a matter of days.  There are those in Russia who comply with the deadlines and do their job without any extra ponts. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/82d89641/1d383bf3/a5066566/b13bad7a.png" alt="Plush androids flooded" width="300" align="left"><br>  With charms everything turned out to be somewhat more cunning.  By the unique design they are made almost everywhere.  But manufacturers in Russia either answered for two weeks, or broke such prices, which turned out more profitable in China.  It turned out that the network has resources where it is possible to connect even with small shops engaged in manufacturing in the Middle Kingdom.  After going through a couple of dozen sentences, they settled on the most appropriate, and after a long correspondence they organized successful cooperation.  All you need is just internet, e-mail, Western Union and EMS.  It is worth noting that the Chinese were illiterate in terms of English, but very mandatory in terms of terms and promises.  And soon the charms went by courier to Russia.  I must say that EMS worked like a clock, and after successful customs clearance, we had small androids in our hands.

      ROBOKASSA was chosen as the payment system.  She bribed low interest on payments and what charges them only from the seller.  Some very smart systems also rob customers.  But due to misunderstandings and the state of the moon in the wrong phase, registration and registration in Robokassa stretched as much as 22 days instead of 3 promised.  In particular, this prevented us from preparing for Google Developers Day and writing an article here a couple of weeks earlier. <br><br><h4>  Result </h4><br>  And finally, we are ready to please you with the first results of our efforts!
