  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of two cradle for HTC Desire S by Mugen Power</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> This is a detailed review of the two cradles for the Mugen Power HTC Desire S smartphone.  The first part of the review is devoted to the <b>KDG-LXH-HTDS desktop cradle</b> .  The second part of the review is the <b>KDG-CS1-HTDS car cradle</b> . <br>  The review includes not only an external inspection of devices with a list of their characteristics, but also a complete disassembly of devices. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, after prolonged use of the extended battery for my smartphone (a review of which I wrote earlier), making sure that the battery is quite high-quality, I had a desire to acquire the cradles produced by this company from China. <br>  On the manufacturer's website, I saw two models, one desktop, the other, respectively - automotive.  I was interested in both models. <br>  Having contacted the Russian-speaking representative of the company, who was already familiar to me, I agreed to receive these devices.

      After a couple of weeks in the mail I was waiting for a parcel post. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9bb/934/c64/9bb934c6453800abe03cef121b6ba8c0.jpg"><br>  Cradle packaging. <br><br>  It was packed pretty high quality. <br>  Opening the box, I saw the tightly packed cradles.  Everything is neat, in its little bags, and the auto-cradle is in a separate box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/089/c93/e4d/089c93e4de0ef67eeb54aa4908498532.jpg"><br>  The contents of the box. <br><br>  The first to test was a desktop cradle. <br><br>  Here is what they write about this cradle on the site: <br>  <b>The angle of your pocket PC will allow you to easily see the screen and have quick and convenient access to the menu, which will allow you to use the device with the maximum impact.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Features:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Compatible with USB and USB2 ports</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Ability to simultaneously synchronize and charge</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Current protection</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Equipped with LED indicator (LED)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Port for charging extra battery</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Compatible with PC and Mac (Mac)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- The perfect accessory for mobile professionals</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Included:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- cradle</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- 1 AC charger</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- 1 USB cable</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  And running ahead, I will say that this is true but, about everything in order. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b7/504/462/2b7504462ce5ece1bcb960780cbe19de.jpg"><br>  Contents of delivery. <br><br>  Included was all of the above.  Cradle is pretty weighty, despite its size, however, you still have to pull out the smartphone, holding the cradle with your hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/706/74c/ca3/70674cca374165ffcf373d02fce5581f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d36/eff/c45/d36effc456ed11176a3b8008f1f507b0.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a33/565/727/a335657277d7a4413a936f7c51e24feb.jpg"><br>  Cradle front, back and bottom. <br><br>  Assembled carefully, nothing anywhere backlash.  Partially glossy plastic, partially matte.  Materials of high quality and pleasant to the touch. <br>  Rubber feet do not allow to slide on a smooth surface. <br><br>  The power supply is standard, with a USB-A connector.  It has a red LED that glows when the power supply is plugged into an outlet.  It gives out 5V and 1A, like the native HTC charging, but the native charging is designed to charge only the smartphone, and then it can simultaneously charge and add.  battery, so it seems to me that it would make sense to make a more powerful BP.  Although the scenario of simultaneous charging of both smartphone and battery is not frequent. <br><br>  The USB-micro USB cable is normal, the length is as short as the native HTC. <br><br>  On the cradle there are two LEDs.  Blue ‚Äî glows when power is applied to the cradle.  The second is two-color.  Lights up red when charging extra.  battery.  Green - if add.  the battery is charged or when it is not inserted into the charging slot.  Both the smartphone and the battery are inserted into the cradle perfectly and easily. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f8c/7d6/d7d/f8c7d6d7d2bdd537aa18c2e48ace981a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ce/106/8a6/4ce1068a66b2bac09b44edc13f2dcabb.jpg"><br>  Smartphone and battery in cradle. <br><br>  When you install the smartphone in the cradle, it does not automatically go into dock mode.  I do not know what it is connected with - with the firmware of a smartphone or a cradle device.  In the open spaces of the network, I found that this was solved by closing the microUSB pin 4 with a minus, but I did not conduct such experiments.  In principle, for me, the lack of an automatic transition to the dock mode is even better, since a constantly burning screen is not the best idea.  And if anyone needs it, they can display the dock mode icon on the desktop. <br>  Charging took place in the normal mode without any nuances.  Synchronization with the computer - as well. <br><br>  Now you can see the inside of the device. <br>  Let's start with the BP. <br>  Understands easily unscrewing just one screw.  No snaps. <br>  Made well.  There is a chip ‚ÄúBL 817C 135‚Äù.  Specification on it in the internet did not find. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b9/40b/bd9/1b940bbd9182f05a5224b64dfee2d896.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ceb/0fd/89b/ceb0fd89b3dc505aaef00570fb3f5ee9.jpg"><br>  The insides of BP. <br><br>  Now let's get to the cradle itself. <br>  To disassemble it, you need to unscrew 6 screws on the bottom.  Two - in the middle and four - under the rubber feet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6d4/38b/e31/6d438be314c59e0bb515763e9d71efcb.jpg"><br>  The insides of the cradle. <br><br>  A piece of metal is bolted to the lid (bottom), which acts as a weighting agent. <br>  But we are interested in the charge charge additional battery. <br>  Having unscrewed two screws, you can pull it out and examine it in detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/068/ea4/8dd/068ea48ddb90e6a0f3555d76df216f47.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/53d/799/adc/53d799adcecdca86a13234d327c399bf.jpg"><br>  Charging board for additional battery. <br><br>  For charging, the control chip ‚ÄúTP4056‚Äù is used.  It is designed to charge Li-Ion batteries and can deliver charge current up to 1000 mA.  Detailed description of the chip on the link <br><br>  The smartphone connector is unsoldered on the scarf, but nothing remarkable.  In front of the LEDs, diffusers are inserted into the cradle body. <br>  And the LEDs themselves are soldered to bolted textolite shawls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9d/9a9/f7e/d9d9a9f7eedd8f234cfe6f4b8563a818.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the assembly is neat and credible. <br><br><h4>  Now let's get down to the KDG-CS1-HTDS car cradle. </h4><br><br>  Here is what is written about it on the manufacturer's website: <br><br>  <b>Main characteristics:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- charging for the communicator</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- speaker and microphone</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- volume control</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- multifunctional button for receiving / ending a call</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- USB input 2.5 mm</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- headphone input</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Specifications:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Weight: 220g</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Dimensions: 130 x 30 x 95 mm</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Certificate:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- CE.</b>  <b>FCC.</b>  <b>E-Mark &amp; ‚Äã‚ÄãRoHS</b> <br><br>  In about the certificate, I believe in a word. <br><br>  It includes a cradle itself, a sucker-rod on which a cradle is fastened and a plastic circle that can be glued somewhere in the car and attached to the barbell on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/12c/56a/796/12c56a7967177d90c018b73c200bcc01.jpg"><br>  Car Cradle Kit <br><br>  A cradle consists of two parts connected by a cable, i.e.  these parts can not be separated.  So, if you need to stretch the cable in the car through a small hole, then it will be very difficult, if not impossible, since both parts of the cradle are quite massive. <br><br>  Sucker rod works fine.  The bar itself is not long and keeps on the glass hard, which prevents the cradle from rocking with the phone and the image on the screen of the phone can be seen without problems.  To adjust the slope and rotation of the cradle on the rod there is a turning mechanism that is tightened with a screw-on ring.  The cradle itself is attached to the bar by a latch that holds the cradle securely and at the same time it is quite easy to detach. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/30c/e06/c90/30ce06c907159b8506ae88adb0114cdf.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f84/757/011/f847570117f0b683365326633c5678a0.jpg"><br>  Swivel mechanism and sucker rod. <br><br>  The plastic mug on the back of the double-sided tape company "3M", which, in theory, should guarantee good gluing to the dashboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d59/f5b/4df/d59f5b4df2044e469ab43d1bb56e4403.jpg"><br>  Reverse side of a plastic mug with double-sided tape. <br><br>  On the part of the cradle where the smartphone is inserted, there is a microphone and a power cable with a microUSB connector, and a four-pin headset jack.  On the wall is glued a piece of porous rubber, designed to protect the back cover of the smartphone from scratches. <br>  Snaps onto the rod securely, can be easily removed by pressing the lug of the rod latch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cee/6d6/960/cee6d6960ad5f7862729643df970e2ed.jpg"><br>  Top of the cradle. <br><br>  The part of the cradle that is inserted into the cigarette lighter is quite large.  In my car, the cigarette lighter is located near the right foot, and when I insert this part of the cradle there, I begin to hook it on my foot.  We have to charge this charge a little to the side.  But, as I noted, on many modern cars the cigarette lighter is located in the middle or even around the parking brake knob, so there shouldn't be such problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/85a/d51/7b6/85ad517b667d97336466e61e6cc8ae58.jpg"><br>  The lower part of the cradle in the cigarette lighter cars. <br><br>  So consider this detail. <br>  There is a answer / end button. <br>  Next - a big speaker. <br>  Below - LED informing about the supply voltage. <br>  On the right is a USB-A connector, to which you can plug in another device for charging, and there is also a volume control wheel. <br>  On the left is a switch that enables / disables charging of the phone and headphone output. <br>  Gives out charging 5V and 1A. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c93/f06/49c/c93f0649c678f78960d475207bf84b7d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/77d/855/a05/77d855a05ee36e7b9a19e35afc33faf2.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/37c/d68/955/37cd68955e8af04e3a43b682320df415.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/29f/9db/868/29f9db868c9c526f88948cda68d5a185.jpg"><br>  The bottom of the cradle. <br><br>  There are no complaints about the quality of work.  The speaker is loud and clear.  Voice prompts of the GPS navigator are perfectly audible even with loud music. <br>  As a Hands-Free, everything also worked ‚Äúwith a bang.‚Äù  We with the interlocutor perfectly heard each other. <br><br>  Let's see what's inside. <br>  First, I disassembled the upper part: <br>  removed the latch connector, unscrewing the four screws. <br>  Then, unscrewing four more screws, took off the cover and saw the microphone as well as the connections for the headset wire and power supply.  Everything is done neatly, the junction of the wiring is insulated with a shaker.  In general, inspires confidence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a0/cee/c1b/7a0ceec1b2d08cfb54e01d4ee3f4250e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f2/f46/4fa/4f2f464fa78677209cc1dc9a1c8532e3.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/903/193/eae/903193eaeb0fe2e0193b1ac3c7ded5b9.jpg"><br>  The insides and microphone of the upper part of the cradle. <br><br>  At the bottom of the cradle there is a fairly large spring-loaded fuse. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7fb/c3c/384/7fbc3c384b0de1333b86b0f5e28fe23e.jpg"><br>  Fuse. <br><br>  The bottom of the cradle is also disassembled by unscrewing the four screws. <br>  Having separated the two halves of the lower part, we will see a large speaker and a board. <br>  Unscrewing another screw in the center of the board, the board can be removed and viewed from the other side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f66/4f9/3e3/f664f93e3fd455b9f7413ae1c08e36c4.jpg"><br>  The inside of the bottom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cfa/088/280/cfa088280498ed2baf1c7f51c9539665.jpg"><br>  The reverse side of the board. <br><br>  As a DC / DC converter, an LM2575S chip is used, which should bring the onboard voltage to 5V.  A more detailed description of the chip on the link <br><br>  Soldering elements neat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ead/2aa/b05/ead2aab05015f841c682dcea508542f8.jpg"><br>  Top of the cradle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c5/e18/f49/9c5e18f490309ab85430f8bce79e1c0a.jpg"><br>  General view of the car cradle. <br><br><h5>  Findings. </h5><br><h6>  Desktop Cradle KDG-LXH-HTDS. </h6><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  1. High-quality cradle for a smartphone; <br>  2. There is a slot for charging an additional battery; <br>  3. Cradle is weighted, which should not allow the cradle to slide on the table; <br>  4. The power supply is disconnected and can be used separately; <br>  5. There is no automatic transition to dock mode. <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  1. There is no automatic transition to dock mode. <br>  2. If you use a case or box for a smartphone, then you will not be comfortable using the cradle. <br><br><h6>  Auto-cradle KDG-CS1-HTDS </h6><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  1. Securely fastened to the windshield; <br>  2. The ability to attach not only to the windshield; <br>  3. Built-in loud hands-free; <br>  4. USB output for charging another gadget; <br>  5. Qualitatively made <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  1. Parts are not detached and it is not possible to pull the cable through small holes or slots; <br>  2. Pretty massive. <br><br>  In general, I am very pleased with the cradles.  Mugen Power made them qualitatively and, apparently, electrically safe for your gadget.  The company quickly produces accessories for new devices.  For example, cradles for the Galaxy S3 and HTC One X are already available. <br>  In order not to be considered for advertising, links to cradles will be placed only upon request. <br>  It makes sense to place this post in the hub of ‚Äúsmartphones and communicators‚Äù, but not enough karma. <br><br>  Add links, upon request. <br>  <a href="http://www.mugen-power-batteries.ru/">Site itself</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.mugen-power-batteries.ru/htc/htc-desire-s-s510e/htc-desire-s-usb-desktop-cradle-with-2nd-battery-slot.html">Cradle tabletop</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.mugen-power-batteries.ru/htc/htc-desire-s-s510e/htc-desire-s-car-mount-cradle-with-handsfree.html">Cradle car</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153729/</a></p>
