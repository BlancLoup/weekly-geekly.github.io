How does your private server, which buzzes on the balcony, differ from serious business?  What you need to do to become a real hoster, in addition to buying a pack of "hard"?  And so - on points: <br><br>  <b>1) Messages about high server load - blackmail for the sake of switching to a more expensive tariff</b> <br>  Moreover, many users think that the hoster deliberately creates a load in order to make them pay more.  In fact, the hoster has something to do without such nonsense.  Associated with this is no less common myth that ... <br><br>  <b>2) Good hosting happens for $ 2 per month</b> <br>  There are no comments here.  People read contracts, read descriptions of tariffs.  And at the same time, they do not cease to be surprised and always call in support with the question: ‚ÄúWhy is my site now 7 and a half minutes lying?‚Äù Sometimes I want to answer with a phrase from the movie ‚ÄúHighway 60‚Äù:

      - What you pay is what you have! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>3) Russian hosters do not pay taxes</b> <br>  Many do not know, but in Russia there are taxes, and there are expenses not only for their payment, but also for the maintenance of accounting and lawyers, who decide all these issues.  If the client wants to work with a legal entity, and not with a freelancer, then the price of services will certainly be based on the cost of the work of the above employees.  This distinguishes the "official" hoster from the freelance server on the balcony. <br><br>  <b>4) Permits and licenses for "hosting activities" are not needed</b> <br>  In addition to taxes, there is another job for lawyers: to issue a communication center at the Ministry of Communications.  They say that at least 200,000 rubles is needed for only pieces of paper for hosting. <br><br>  <b>5) ‚ÄúGirls‚Äù sit in tech support</b> <br>  To organize really high-quality support, and not just ‚Äúa system for switching customers between employees,‚Äù we need qualified specialists.  Qualified technical support (especially round-the-clock) is an important part of the hosting company's customer service.  In Moscow, and indeed in Russia, such experts are very expensive! <br><br>  <b>6) "Iron" is worth a penny</b> <br>  A decent white hoster will never allow himself to buy iron of unknown origin, unspecified brands, used, or - even worse - to collect the server himself.  Quality servers (for example, Dell) or routers (for example, Cisco) cost a fair amount of money and are amortized over several years.  The cost of this equipment cannot be compared with the cost of similar hard drives purchased on the Savelovsky market (which really cost a penny).  Oh yeah, the cost of renting a square meter in a Class A data center is close to the cost of renting a home in a not very bad district of Moscow. <br><br>  In the USA, the same equipment will be much cheaper (when it is one third, and when it is two thirds!), Not to mention the rent in the data center and the cost of the channel.  That is why Russia in the near future is unlikely to be able to compete with the West. <br><br>  <b>7) Return of money to the current account, but not webmania - kidalovo</b> <br>  There are cases of refund to the client.  If the services were paid for not with real money, but with virtual (webmoney, Yandex.Money, etc.), the question arises of the return.  Many users think that once payment was made in webmans, they should be returned in webmans.  In fact, all webmoney with money is hosted to the hoster not on the wallet of the payment system, but on the p / s, and he legally conducts them in accounting.  There are laws in the country that regulate these relations, and a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù company cannot do otherwise.  Therefore, the return of such funds is also made through the accounting department, legally, at the client's account. <br><br>  <b>8) Daily backup is done by the hoster so that if the client erases something, it can be restored</b> <br>  In fact, backup is done by the hoster in order to restore the client's content in case of failure.  To protect against their own mistakes, the client needs to make a backup to his local machine before important changes.  This is the most correct behavior. <br><br>  <b>9) Hoster has the right to close the site only by court order</b> <br>  In connection with the latest events (with the closure of torrents.ru), the opinion emerged that the actions of the RuCenter were illegal.  They say that the termination of delegation from the domain on request from the authorities, in the absence of a court decision, is illegal.  However, it is not.  Under Russian law, the provider is obliged to fulfill an official request from the authorities.  Therefore, it is incorrect to condemn RuCenter - in the same way, any domain would be closed regardless of which registrar has the domain in service. <br><br>  <b>10) Volume of the Russian market</b> <br>  The total number of customers in the market in absolute terms is relatively small.  This does not allow Russian providers to set minimum prices, reducing margins, and winning at the turnovers.  How do global providers do - the global market is much larger, and you can dump it much lower. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88606/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88606/</a></p>
