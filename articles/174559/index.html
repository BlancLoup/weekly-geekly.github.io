      But the back cover has become more interesting - with just such a pattern under a layer of varnish.  And we still have to pay tribute to the developers - it still lies perfectly in the hand, although the display diagonal is increased to five inches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa5/f41/21e/aa5f4121eaab0b20b2433195a45f15de.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbf/54f/a6c/cbf54fa6ca081cd8e221690cf84c760c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the thumb is the lock button, and under the index finger - the volume control.  Bottom is traditionally a microphone and a micro USB port, on top of the audio jack, a second microphone for noise reduction and a new chip is an infrared port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ae/f5f/d88/3aef5fd88a3f01f105eb5d233731f99b.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ae/f5f/d88/3aef5fd88a3f01f105eb5d233731f99b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With the help of it and the WatchON application, you can control TVs and other equipment that has an appropriate receiver.  The truth is that the infrared port is still not very powerful, and 10 meters is the maximum distance for stable operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e4/6fd/572/7e46fd572e8e634bed0246434cf0b907.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  On the front panel there is a traditional Samsung Home button, and, of course, a display.  Its diagonal, as already mentioned, is five inches, and of course the resolution is also in trend - FullHD, i.e.  1920x1080 pixels.  Remarkable, but still useless achievement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b9/612/bf0/6b9612bf09d5ec9c9a2ccc7677b4068e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade by technology Super AMOLED Plus, which makes this screen one of the brightest.  Well, the viewing angles are excellent, but the color rendition is an amateur.  To some, it may seem too acidic, although I personally really like it. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  Finally, we got to the part of the story, to which Samsung did not get to the presentation in New York.  It‚Äôs understandable, the company wouldn‚Äôt want to fool people‚Äôs head and deliver the same modification everywhere, but under pressure from operators in the USA, models with four cores and a proven LTE module will be supplied on the Qualcomm chipset.  In Russia and other Samsung-developed developing countries, the modification will come with an Exynos 5 Octa processor and PowerVR SGX 544MP graphics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fb/1a7/bf2/9fb1a7bf296ab41a7946d36b515b4a24.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Most of the benchmarks see only half of the cores, since the new Exynos does not have eight cores in the literal sense of the word, but two sets of four each.  When super power is not needed, the A7 cores work, and when there is a need for real performance, the Samsung A15 agalogues are included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/459/e64/c65/459e64c65fbae8af546e14be5de78b0a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The RAM of the device is two gigabytes, and the main one is from 16 to 64 GB.  And this volume can be expanded up to 128 gigs using microSDXC cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8b/926/61d/d8b92661da593093aa7b00b7f2bbcccd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Soft and chips </h4><br>  The Galaxy S4 runs on Android 4.2.2, but most of the new Google system chips have been replaced by Samsung counterparts.  For example, with all the desire you will not find here the photosphere.  Instead, a certain Samsung Orb was promised, but I did not find this application on Google Play or Samsung Apps.  But after studying the pre-installed programs, if I didn‚Äôt get excited, I started looking at TouchWiz and the Samsung ecosystem as a whole with great enthusiasm. <br><br>  In addition to the already mentioned WatchON and the long-known S Planner and S Memo, the company's translator S Translator appeared in the system, which, unlike Google‚Äôs, partially works offline as well (about 1,800 common words and expressions are available to the traveler).  True, the Russian language is not there yet, but by the beginning of sales in our country it should already appear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65c/fb1/c3b/65cfb1c3b03eb2e95635cbb0cccb976d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Rate wonderful scrolling captions on the wide button;)</i> <br><br>  S Voice has become much more useful and stable thing, which took root and beyond the application itself.  Say, you can control a camera, a player and even a browser without hands in Russian.  True, only the standard Samsung, in Chrome, so do not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01a/15b/9fb/01a15b9fb1064d029eadaf7708fb129e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, Samsung developed the S Health app, which will allow you to keep track of your sporting achievements.  The name, of course, for those who know English sounds quite funny, but that‚Äôs the end of the fun, because  the program actually turned out to be convenient and useful.  With it, you can keep diaries of weight, meals, workouts and automatically using the Galaxy S IV accelerometer to count how many steps you took in a day.  At the same time, S Health will also make recommendations regarding the conditions of the exercises based on the data obtained from the temperature and humidity sensors embedded in the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/668/f75/201/668f752018f903668ffbed499a312e9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, various accessories can be connected to it.  In the current version of the program, only a couple of models of scales with Bluetooth are available, but in the long term all additional Samsung gadgets announced by Samsung will be added. <br><br>  Galxy S IV is equipped with a large number of sensors, on the basis of which many alternative control methods are implemented without the need to touch the screen.  By holding your hand in standby mode over the display, you can call up on the screen for a few seconds basic information about incoming calls, messages and letters. <br><br>  In addition, pre-installed applications such as the browser, music player, email client, and S Planner support thumbnail movements above the screen.  By moving your hand left or right, you can change the tab or track, and the movement from top to bottom affects the scrolling of the screen. <br><br>  Even S IV, unlike S III, already more or less tolerably follows the owner‚Äôs eyes and can pause the video when no one is looking at the screen (although this is a controversial thing, why not!), And also scroll up and down when the look gets to the edge of the screen (it does not always work well and only with good lighting). <br><br>  Well, then there are all sorts of little things like automatic unlocking the screen when it detects a home network, the output of the remote control appliances based on GPS data or, again, when it detects home Wi-Fi, etc.  etc.  It's easier not to talk about it, but to show what I am doing on the video. <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  On the back of the case is a camera with LED flash.  With this module, we didn‚Äôt subtilize it and equipped it with a 13 megapixel sensor - like everyone else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82b/2fb/0cc/82b2fb0cc8f6a1dd9a6fa01674e0aec6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It removes better than S3, but this is not a breakthrough, but just a tribute to fashion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c4/a45/f0e/6c4a45f0e524592779bbbed0199b26bb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Open image <a href="">in original resolution</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/230/064/611/230064611320f7025a41c46b414892e7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Open image <a href="">in original resolution</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68f/bbc/f0f/68fbbcf0f95dc07e78b041633972ef1e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Open image <a href="">in original resolution</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/875/311/ea7/875311ea797c04eafc5959662a261dbe.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Open image <a href="">in original resolution</a></i> <br><br>  And, of course, the camera can shoot video in FullHD resolution at a speed of 30 k / s. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CpNGQm7DpJw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhhULEfuHYmHH3M21Pssj2xWXrgkPQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  It is clear that all these numerous sensors, constantly working in the background services and other large screens consume a lot of energy, in connection with which Samsung needed to shove a large battery into the Galaxy S IV.  And they did it: in this model, a removable 2600 mAh battery.  It would seem: cool!  But even with this capacity, my gadget with all the services turned on discharges in 12 hours. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  If someone once again waited for Samsung to introduce a space cruiser instead of a smartphone, then he naturally made a mistake.  Galaxy S IV is not far from the previous model (although I like the new smart more), but it was equipped with a bunch of new sensors and many software chips were implemented in it.  Some of them, of course, are just ‚Äúfor beauty‚Äù, but some can be really useful.  The Samsung smartphone has finally become a real part of the ecosystem that this company is gradually creating.  In my opinion, S IV is such a very smart and powerful control panel for all other gadgets that is in the house. <br><br><h4>  Specs </h4><br>  <b>OS:</b> Android 4.2.2 <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Exynos 5 Octo (4 cores A7 + 4 cores A15) <br>  <b>Video:</b> PowerVR SGX 544MP <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 2 GB <br>  <b>Main memory:</b> 16-64 GB + microSD slot <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 5 ", Super AMOLED, 1920 x 1080 <br>  <b>Communications:</b> Wi-Fi (a / b / g / n / ac), Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, USB 2.0, infrared <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> USB (USB Host), 3.5mm audio jack <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 13 8 megapixels.  + 2.1 megapixels. <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS, GPS, GLONASS <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 2600 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 136.6 x 69.8 x 7.9 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 130 grams <br>  <b>Price:</b> 29990 rub. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  And here's another for comparison S IV and S III side by side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/910/143/c40/910143c4004404285740198cfa01839f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/329/7ab/331/3297ab331bb6ea7969da6e980c4beb03.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174559/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174559/</a></p>
