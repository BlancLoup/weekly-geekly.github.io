  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of PocketBook 616 - the most affordable PocketBook 2018 with backlight function</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  At the very end of the summer of 2018, the PocketBook company released an updated line of readers.  It includes three models, namely PocketBook 616 (8,900 rubles), PocketBook 627 (10,900 rubles) and PocketBook 632 (12,900 rubles).  Reviews of all these devices will appear in the official PocketBook blog on Habr√©, and you are reading the first one right now.  I decided to start with <a href="http://pocketbook.ru/shop/ustroystva/pocketbook-616-chernyy/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_content%3D616%26utm_campaign%3Daug2018">PocketBook 616</a> , the most affordable representative of the new line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hu/bw/kv/hubwkv5xgv6nbpk6kn8gu99qvvw.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But first, something about the general features of all the representatives of the new line.  What actually changed? <br><br><ul><li>  In all three new readers, the emphasis is on minimizing dimensions without losing ergonomics.  That is, the same PocketBook 616 is about 20% smaller and 10% lighter than its predecessor, the PocketBook 615 Plus.  A similar story with the PocketBook 627 and PocketBook 632, when compared with previous models. </li><li>  All three new readers thoroughly screwed up power consumption.  And tests show that they are no longer working ‚Äúfor about a month,‚Äù but ‚Äúfor about one and a half months.‚Äù  More precisely, not so: PocketBook 616 and PocketBook 627 give six weeks, and PocketBook 632 - up to eight weeks.  This is because the flagship model received the same economical dual-core processor as the PocketBook 740. </li><li>  All three readers demonstrate an increase in speed.  In some situations, about two times, but in most cases an approximately 50 percent increase is noticeable. </li></ul><br>  Something like that.  New poketbooks have become a) faster, b) more compact and lighter and c) more autonomous.  Revolution?  Well I do not know.  If not, then very, very progressive evolution.  Because poketbooks have become better in key parameters.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xt/su/ee/xtsueeajqer7hexmh207iqcj1ak.jpeg"><br><br>  Actually, what is PocketBook 616?  This is the heiress of the PocketBook 615 Plus, released in September 2017 and becoming the most affordable backlit notebook at the start of sales.  Model 616 is also the most affordable illuminated software, but already 2018 model years.  To understand what the developers have improved and what they added, I will give a table.  In it, we compare the PocketBook 615 Plus and 616 - everything is simple and clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/st/bf/4h/stbf4hukns8854u8zxpu-kxd8hu.png"><br><br><h2>  Design </h2><br>  PocketBook quite rarely changes the design of its models - for example, the 615 Plus model outwardly and structurally differed little from the 615 model, as well as from the 614 series models. PocketBook 616 offers a completely different design.  And he, in my opinion, is better than the previous models.  Why do I think so? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_c/u5/bn/_cu5bnbepvtutjjpwl0ksvrq2hq.jpeg"><br><br>  The first reason is compactness.  The reader is about one and a half centimeters shorter than its predecessor, 7 millimeters narrower and 15 grams lighter.  As a result, PocketBook 616 is easier to clasp with one hand behind it, and it fits into the average pocket much more readily than the PocketBook 615 Plus.  In general, the impressions from the design and construction of the PocketBook 616 are the most positive - the developers really tried.  And did much better than it was.  Although it was so good, but it was generally wonderful!  It is especially nice to see such improvements in the budget model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/im/bo/m7/imbom7sd3vgoclhgaoctxg6n0nk.jpeg"><br>  <i>PocketBook 616 next to <a href="https://habr.com/company/pocketbook/blog/373553/">PocketBook 614 Plus</a> (in 615 Plus, I remind you, exactly the same design and the same dimensions)</i> <br><br>  The second reason is more convenient buttons.  In particular, in 616 models there are clearly highlighted ‚Äúpetals‚Äù of page turning.  They have a clearer move than associates in the PocketBook 615 Plus, where the buttons were hidden under a single front panel and were indicated by small arrows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/db/a7/ab/dba7abrwk2_eykka9tmmeirki3q.jpeg"><br><br>  The central button - by the way, it can also be used to turn pages - has also become more convenient.  Now it is not round, but elongated horizontally.  And pushing it is much nicer.  I pay special attention to the convenience of the keys, since the screen in 616 models is non-touch, and you will have to deal exclusively with buttons when controlling the reader.  Therefore, in fact, ergonomics is so important.  In addition, I note that non-sensory reading rooms are often taken by children (so as not to be distracted by touchscreens) and older people (who find it difficult to master these touchscreens).  We wish the children and grandparents the very best and the most convenient, and they will definitely like the PocketBook 616. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7c/r2/lj/7cr2ljzvudsr6xx5dwuliqvwmxk.jpeg"><br><br>  With all this, the block of keys was made narrower, due to which, in fact, PocketBook 616 turns out to be more compact than previous models. <br><br>  Both the back and front panels of the case have a velvety coating.  While PocketBook 616 is available in black and silver versions.  The latter looks particularly successful - you are straight mercury! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vw/sp/cr/vwspcrisoyyybrhn7lnf1_ksj9a.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9k/gi/mj/9kgimje2-sok8zs6rsg_dmg3om8.jpeg"><br><br>  What else to say about the case?  Perhaps two moments illuminate.  The first is the location of other controls (and not only controls);  The microSD card slot, the microUSB port and the power button are located on the bottom of the case, that is, traditionally for PocketBook readers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4x/bf/-d/4xbf-dzmrvefaiib3-cs8hr5zui.jpeg"><br><br>  The second point is the build quality: it is, again, traditional for PocketBook, high.  I remember that in 2012, some models of the company squeaked under compression in the hand, but now there is nothing like that. <br><br><h2>  Screen </h2><br>  The screen migrated to PocketBook 616 from the previous model without changes.  This matrix E Ink Carta with a diagonal of 6 inches and a resolution of 1024 x 758 pixels.  It is impossible to say anything special about it.  I note only that the image is more pleasant to the eye than in the case of the cheapest readers with 800 x 600. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zx/n1/kt/zxn1ktlqglfqj4h3hgh7wcjwku0.jpeg"><br><br>  The screen does not blind in the sun, does not give glare, it provides the autonomy for up to a month of regular reading of books - in general, all the advantages of E Ink are taking place. <br><br>  The backlight in the 616 model is the most common - solid white.  About her, too, nothing special can be said.  Nice looking uniform lighting and a long scale of brightness adjustment - that‚Äôs actually all.  (Behind the backlight with adjustable color temperature, that is, non-monotonous, welcome to PocketBook 740 or 632.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vv/fj/h2/vvfjh2zhe7dik8zovexaxh_dx9g.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  In work </h2><br>  First and foremost: Like any other PocketBook reader, the Model 616 supports 18 book and document formats.  Here is a list of them: PDF, PDF (DRM), EPUB, EPUB (DRM), DJVU, FB2, FB2.ZIP, DOC, DOCX, RTF, PRC, TCR, TXT, CHM, HTM, HTML, MOBI and ACSM.  This suggests that almost any book found on the web will open on this reader without problems.  Text settings are as follows: 13 selectable fonts, hyphenation, line spacing, typeface, size, vertical or horizontal orientation of the screen.  In general, you can customize the display of books exactly as you specifically want.  Of course, it would be more convenient to indulge in all these tweaking in the settings from the touch screen, but with the help of the keys this is also realistic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9b/sq/fu/9bsqfuohc-cbimk1lfrt0jvfme0.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rj/rl/yi/rjrlyi6nuxqrcxkahk99iosees4.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iq/-p/lo/iq-plof-pl25vtftuoyts1frmne.jpeg"><br><br>  Among other amenities, I note the presence of four dictionaries, they can be called either from the menu or directly while reading a book, highlighting a specific word and immediately receiving the translation.  In my opinion, a very useful feature for those who study foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãby reading books in the original. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yv/4h/_v/yv4h_vftfqmsnrtzkgblj-ihd3m.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zc/uj/z2/zcujz2sipy_wz2cp8f8bgytfoj4.jpeg"><br><br>  The main screen of PocketBook 616 is presented in the form of a page with a list of recently added / open books, as well as four icons: library, dictionary, applications, settings.  The application menu is designed in the same way as in smartphones and tablets on Android - that is, in the form of a matrix of icons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jh/cf/08/jhcf08hxvvtfpzxxbciqjeqylx0.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e1/wl/jh/e1wljhrsynhxojj2vqkpsq6fnqk.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hi/gy/vr/higyvrhbkra-t9ce1chkbj1sjis.jpeg"><br><br>  In PocketBook 616 there are several simple games, a calendar, a calculator and a photo album.  The latter allows you to view photos, however, only in black and white. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/op/wp/ckopwpj7kcp-ipbrg0vr2bkdmxs.jpeg"><br><br>  Network capabilities (read - support Wi-Fi) in the novelty is not.  Such is the consequence of its budget essence.  As for performance, yes, I can't help noting that the PocketBook 616 is noticeably smarter than previous budget cards.  There are no delays when turning pages or navigating through the interface.  In general, it is clear that over the software well conjured.  And it is above the software, since the iron in PocketBook 616 is the same as in 615 Plus. <br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  Cable, manual, warranty - nothing else in the box and no.  The main thing here is the guarantee: PocketBook provides its readers with a two-year warranty.  And if you buy in the company's online store PocketBook, then as many as three years of brand warranty.  This is really a lot against the background of the standard year warranty, which is given by almost all other manufacturers of gadgets, including all other manufacturers of readers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/em/nh/k1/emnhk1t0xqzfc6bgysvmc9zw7so.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  The update seemed interesting to me - the ergonomics improved significantly, the dimensions decreased, the autonomy increased, the speed increased.  In general, PocketBook 616 is a decent reader, it seems to be an entry level, which actually gives more than you expect from it.  For example, a two- or even three-year warranty, thoughtful software with support for 18 book formats, cool ergonomics.  And, of course, a good E Ink screen with backlighting is the most important thing that is required from readers as a class of devices.  Well, in general, it should be noted that <a href="http://pocketbook.ru/shop/ustroystva/pocketbook-616-chernyy/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_content%3D616%26utm_campaign%3Daug2018">PocketBook 616 is</a> much steeper than the same PocketBook 615 Plus.  Remnants of this model are found somewhere in stores, but it makes no sense to buy it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s6/op/ws/s6opwstns5-w_7elz888qjjps9o.jpeg"><br><br>  If you have any questions regarding PocketBook 616, welcome to comments! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421545/</a></p>
