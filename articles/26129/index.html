  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thoughts of freedom</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the light of recent events, the changes in the worldview of my friends decided to write their thoughts about freedom ... <br>  FREEDOM ... People revel in this word, without having the slightest idea what it is ... Everyone wants to be free, everyone wants to free others.  America carries its democracy to the third world countries, brings them FREEDOM!  Third World countries are fighting off the regular troops of the American army, they are fighting FOR FREEDOM!  Believers of all religions are sure that it is their religion that will help people gain their freedom, Satanists reject God because he deprives them of FREEDOM ... <br>  As is known, how many people have so many opinions, each person has his own personal notion about what this FREEDOM is. Why is everyone so eager for it?  A person has never been and will never be truly free, the spirit of a person can be free, his soul if you like ... Many people shout "I want to be free!" , they have no friends, limited to acquaintances ... But they can't understand the main thing, there is no freedom.  Man is a social animal, it just so happened ... We all live in a state where there is a vertical of power, we work, and here too there are leaders and subordinates, most of us have a family, where all social roles are also distributed, we all have our own area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility, habits, dependencies, freedom cannot exist as long as these concepts exist ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Who can say that he is truly free?  Now everyone is yelling about it, everyone wants to be free while not understanding what freedom is ... Freedom from what?  From yourself?  From responsibility?  From conscience?  or something else?  There is no freedom in our world, it's time to understand and accept ... <br>  Yes, Freedom is insidious.  Sometimes freedom kills the desire to live and fight.  But.  There is always and always one thing.  All the people listed and not very much.  For most of them, freedom is a tangible concept.  For all, freedom is money, it is power, it is a celebrity.  For some, freedom is just to be able to leave their camera for at least 1 km.  For others - the opportunity to travel on their own continent and not only within the notorious Motherland.  For others, freedom is the absence of any plan and / or schedule (which in my opinion only destabilizes and brings a little more chaos into life).  By the way, maybe for someone freedom is just a mess?  Lack of any systems?  Everybody know what anarchy is?  And they also talk about freedom ... <br><br>  And there are people who do not aspire to power, neither to big money, nor to utopian ideologies ... Just for them, freedom is the freedom of consciousness.  Freedom of thought.  I recall the famous (unfortunately in narrow circles) author Orwell.  There is such a definition ... Thought a crime.  So freedom is a crime thought. </div>
