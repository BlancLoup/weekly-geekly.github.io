  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do we do the newsletter that is read</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0f/fa2/d46/c0ffa2d468574a6faa337945d7d9602a.jpg"><br>  It has long been trying to sit down for this article, but due to insurmountable circumstances constantly postponed.  But recently, a newsletter left us, which convinced me that now you can definitely write an article. <br><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that I‚Äôm not a super-duper email-marketer, but in a startup you have to be a few more specialists sometimes.  So this article is completely the fruit of our experiments, observations and jambs sometimes.  I hope you find something interesting here. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Subscribers Base </h1><br>  I'll start from the beginning - from the base of contacts.  There is very little to tell.  Approximately 80% of the subscribers we inherited from the ashes of the previous unsuccessful launch of a school a year and a half ago.  It consists mostly of those people who have ever attended our events, both paid intensive courses and open lessons.  We also continued this practice.  At one free event, we managed to attract over 300 new subscribers.  What is interesting in free events?  This is a kind of fair exchange - we share our knowledge, and the payment for this is good contact, a person who is interested in Internet marketing.  Of course, we do not expect that all of them will become our clients overnight, but our task is to make sure that when they need courses or consulting, they know exactly who to turn to.  We also encourage new subscribers to the site with free access to our knowledge base with a huge number of videos of our teachers' presentations and articles. <br><br><h1>  Content </h1><br>  In our classes, we try to provide our clients with the maximum level of comfort, so that they do not want to get away from their studies.  And this is not because we want to please, but simply because it is actually very nice.  Because when you exceed customer expectations and get feedback, this is the best reward.  And we try to apply the same approach to our newsletter.

      We think that sending subscribers only promotional materials is somehow simply unfair.  Discounts and promotions, of course, great, but we believe that this is the way for the lazy.  When a person subscribes to a newsletter, he gives you the opportunity to become part of his life and build relationships with him.  But how long you stay in his life and how warm your relationship will be - depends to a large extent on you. <br><br><h3>  So what are we doing in the end? </h3><br><ol><li>  Monthly digest of upcoming events.  There are some companies that send such newsletters.  And I really like them.  This is convenient if you want to organize your time.  And, of course, it is appreciated by people engaged in the constant expansion of their competencies.  We include in the digest not only paid events, but also free open lessons, both ours and outsiders, which we consider worthy of attention and useful for our subscribers. </li><li>  Selection of articles on digital marketing for the month.  Yes, we love to aggregate information.  We live in a time when information flows are so great that it is simply physically impossible to perceive it all.  Therefore, it seemed quite logical in the first half of the month to send some interesting articles and materials over the past, so that our subscribers can be sure that we will help them not to miss anything important. </li><li>  Video lessons.  This is my favorite part, so I left it for last.  Every week we record instructional videos with our teachers specifically for our newsletter.  This video lasts from 3 to 20 minutes and contains interesting theoretical materials on digital marketing.  Of course, large and complex topics in this format are difficult to deploy, but we and our teachers try very hard to prepare something interesting every time.  It‚Äôs really not the easiest type of content to prepare, but the wonderful letters and feedback we receive in return pay off. </li></ol><br>  Of course, we also have standard types of mailing - confirmation of registration for events, reminders about recordings and the like, but I‚Äôll not elaborate on them in more detail. <br><br><h1>  Typos </h1><br>  Typos ... it was about them that was discussed in the introduction.  Recently, in a working confusion, we left a letter with several typos, and some of them were in the registration buttons for events that were very difficult not to notice.  But we were able to, but the subscribers - no. <br><br>  The first two letters from subscribers with comments came almost immediately.  Panic?  Self-flagellation?  No, we realized that our subscribers do not care, they really read our letters, and if they find time to write us that they have noticed typos, this is generally great!  And a great reason for communication in a fun way. <br><br>  Of course, not all readers wrote at once, so somehow pretending that we did not notice what would have happened would have been ugly too.  And we decided to get out of the situation gracefully and with humor.  In the next newsletter, we offered a contest for the most attentive subscribers - the one who will send us a list of all the typos, we gave access to several lectures from our paid course on integrated Internet marketing. <br><br>  This turned out to be a seemingly failure from an interesting and rewarding experience. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for attention!</b>  <b>I hope you read the article with pleasure and learned something new.</b>  <b>And, of course, subscribe to the newsletter on our website <a href="http://impro.pro/">IMpro.pro</a> .</b>  <b>We will all wait.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294164/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294164/</a></p>
