  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is it all bad with RIM and BlackBerry?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Anyone who follows the news from the Canadian company Research In Motion in one way or another has already noticed that a large part of this news is negative - sales forecasts are falling, share prices are falling, large-scale staff changes are outlined ... and so on. <br>  If you read the columns and reports of popular analysts, then the situation is really dramatic.  We decided to summarize the information available in the media and to understand, is it really that really bad? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  News. </h4><br>  As covered in the media position RIM: <br>  - RIM's market position is falling.  It is being supplanted by Apple and Android.  The leader in sales are smartphones with the Android operating system, which occupy 33.64%, followed by Apple, and RIM in fourth place.  Meanwhile, a year ago, RIM and Nokia had the best positions. <br>  <i>What does this mean?</i>  <i>Of course, this suggests that things are really not going very well.</i>  <i>The only question is how much?</i>  <i>And what is the dynamics? Apple and Android make their products with the expectation of a wider audience, while RIM initially focused on the corporate sector.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>RIM devices are devices for businessmen, and now the consumer market is growing, first of all, more and more smartphones are bought by young people, for whom image and a full range of entertainment are most important.</i>  <i>Even in the best of times, which fell on 2007-2009, only every fifth sold smartphone was released Researh in Motion.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the same time, the corporate market still exists, albeit shaken by the crisis, much more consumer.</i>  <i>Of course, this has affected sales, but in this sector, the BlackBerry still holds a high position, because the commitment of the audience of this sector is due not only to the quality and reliability of devices, but also a long tradition, successful use experience and security.</i> <i>

    </i>  <i>It seems that in the consumer sector, the BlackBerry is really inferior and still inferior to Apple and Android, experiencing difficulties in dealing with these brands, but in the corporate segment strategic positions are still being held.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Although you should not forget about the fact that for almost a year RIM did not release new models, concentrating on the Playbook, and is preparing to release a new operating system next year.</i>  <i>It was certainly worth some losses in the smartphone market.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  - Playbook sells poorly.  iPad ahead of the rest. <br><br>  <i>Well, actually, not so bad.</i>  <i>The playbook is slowly but surely selling out and you can‚Äôt call it a failure.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>As for comparisons with the iPad, they are not at all entirely appropriate - the iPad has been on the market for a year and a half, the Playbook has just recently gone on sale, one can say it is only just looking at it and the real peak of sales can still be ahead.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the same time, for the first fiscal quarter of this year, RIM's revenues amounted to $ 4.9 billion, which is 16% higher than in the previous quarter ($ 4.2 billion) and its net profit was $ 695 million or $ 1.33 based on earnings per share.</i>  <i>If this is a disaster, then the disaster is very profitable.</i>  <i>At the same time, RIM's international revenue grew by 67% compared with last year.</i>  <i>However, in the second quarter, the indicators will be much worse and it is possible that it will be the worst in a year for various reasons.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the same time, the leading Apple in this segment is not all pink either - sales of the iPad fell by 40% in the last quarter.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>According to RBC, in the first quarter of this year, Android is the leader in sales, which occupies 33.64% of the market (36 million units were sold in the 1st quarter).</i>  <i>The second place is occupied by the 2010 Nokia leader - 22.51% (24.2 million), the third - by Apple (17.35% of the market or 18.7 million ‚Äúsmarts‚Äù sold), and the top four are closed by RIM - 12.9% , 13.2 million. Meanwhile, a year ago, RIM and Nokia had the best positions.</i>  <i>This is talking about smartphones, which are the basis of sales of competitors, but not about the situation in general.</i> <br><br>  - RIM loses top managers.  Brian Wallace, vice president of digital marketing, Kate Purdy, marketing director, Paul Calbflais creative director, left their post ... <br><br>  <i>Of course, all this may look like ‚Äúflight from a sinking ship‚Äù and all the causes and nuances of leaving tops are little known, but there is room for optimistic forecasts: the place of old specialists will be taken by new ones, with new ideas, plans and methods.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In the end, all these permutations can only carry a positive tint: updating the team will update the company itself and RIM will reach a new level, this is a long time ago, some analysts say.</i> <i><br></i> <br><h4>  Summary. </h4><br>  Summarizing the above, we can safely say that Research in Motion is too early to write off and predict the fate of Palm.  The company is indeed in crisis, but the crisis is due to both internal causes and external, such as changes in the market.  They are all defined and manageable. <br><br>  Ways of overcoming the crisis may be different, but Canadians have chosen a way to reduce costs, making permutations on the bridge and reducing the number of employees and indirect costs.  RIM's net profit for the first quarter of the current fingod fell by almost 10% to $ 695 million compared to the same period last year, according to the company.  Revenue for the reporting period increased by 16% to 4.9 billion dollars. <br><br>  RIM is seriously and for a long time going to expand its presence in new markets and, in particular, in Russia.  It is planned to open its own full-fledged RIM office in Russia, which will have a qualitative effect on the provision of customer service support, speed up the decision on sales in retail networks, as well as other BlackBerry problems in Russia related to the restriction of certain services. <br><br>  It is also necessary to note the start of cooperation with Microsoft in the mobile search.  Everyone says that having enlisted such an impressive partner, RIM will already be easier to resist Apple and other competitors.  Although there are rumors about buying RIM Microsoft or Dell.  They even say that this transaction "may be the most inexpensive acquisition in the industry." <br><br>  However, RIM is still very highly valued by the exchange (about 15 billion dollars), the company has no debts and has a huge number of patents, thanks to the long-term leading position on innovations in digital technologies.  And it may very well be that the hype raised is part of the negotiation process and of the transaction itself in order to make sellers more compliant.  Anyway, we hope that RIM will soon find a way out of current difficulties and regain leadership positions, because, in our opinion, BlackBerry devices are technically superior to their competitors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123205/</a></p>
