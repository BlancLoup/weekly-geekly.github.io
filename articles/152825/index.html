  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The global conspiracy of manufacturers on the example of Asus Transformer Infinity TF700</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is a theory that all of today's manufacturers deliberately make some serious "assumptions" in their products, as a result of which devices do not live for a long time.  For example, if you disassemble the most ordinary teapot, then you will be surprised at how flimsy the mechanism, actuated by the power button, although it is he who suffers the most violence from the consumer and, logically, must be the most durable.  The company Asus with its flagship Transformer Infinity TF700T tablet worth twenty teapots distinguished itself with something similar. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In its previous tablets, ‚ÄúAsus‚Äù has already allowed serious blunders, the most famous of which are weak Wi-Fi and GPS, which have lost their strength due to a completely iron body.  The problem was solved by adding a plastic cover in the antenna area (in the following models, of course).  It would seem that the new devices should be close to perfect, but either because of stupidity, or because of the conspiracy mentioned above, the engineers made another mistake. <br><br>  So, on the TransformerForums forums, complaints about cracks in the same corner are gradually piling up - there are already at least <a href="http://www.transformerforums.com/forum/transformer-pad-infinity-help/26259-screen-crack.html">8 pages there</a> .  It appears completely suddenly - sometimes you can just close the tablet and open it with a crack, or just hold it for the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù part.  And if you drop, as it happened with me, then the chance to crack the glass increases many times. <br><br>  I fell on my tablet in general on the wrong day, as a result I was very upset and accidentally turned the crack into a neat web.  Yes, and the glass itself then did not last long, parting with the body and closely merging with the garbage.  As a result, we now have a working (yes, yes, it works!) Tablet without a display.  You can not manage it, but you can, for example, listen to all sorts of notifications.  Very exciting.

    <h4>  Inside and outside </h4><br>  Actually, the essence of this article is to warn the owners and potential buyers, and at the same time tell how to be if.  Let's start with the pictures.  Fresh and unharmed "Infiniti" looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/319/01f/a23/31901fa23ce45ec47e81f1328c604218.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And he is without a display: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/346/fd8/ff7/346fd8ff7600e93e63c093d4ad3d7f54.jpg"><br>  It is easy to understand from the picture that the upper left corner, where the crack of all the "lucky ones", practically hangs in the air.  Glass is only attached to the glue in the very corner and has no support at all to the middle of the left and top edges.  The left edge as a whole is extremely weak compared to the right and bottom, although it is for him that the majority of people take it when working.  At the same Transformer Forums even published pictures explaining that you should not take the "Infiniti" for the left edge, because it can happen light embarrassment.  In fact, this is the same as releasing a mug and asking not to hold it by the handle. <br><br>  To see and realize the above, you do not need to have special knowledge.  It is enough to hold the tablet without the display for short edges and twist it neatly - the left side will tell you everything at once.  Already, the design engineers had to pass at least the basic course of material resistance and in every possible way to pull their brainchild.  Especially since the praised Gorilla Glass 2 is just thin plexiglass, not titanium, which doesn't care about any loads.  Therefore, it is not very clear what is the reason for this ‚Äúomission‚Äù.  Well, if, of course, to set aside the theory of a worldwide conspiracy of producers to the side. <br><br><h4>  What to do, if </h4><br>  But suppose you are unlucky: you bought this tablet and once found a crack on it.  Changing in a service center is insane, because they want 50-80% of the cost of the device for this business.  It is easier to buy a display with glass on the same ‚ÄúEbee‚Äù (it is not sold yet, as far as I am aware) and replace it yourself.  Well, since I ‚Äúdisassembled‚Äù my tablet, I‚Äôll share a short instruction on dismemberment (the picture is pushable - the fatter option will pop up). <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd1/2e4/9ac/dd12e49acca9604d0f530513743353a0.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  First I will explain what the numbers mean. <br><br><ol><li>  Let's call these details ‚Äúbridges‚Äù.  There are only two of them (one in the picture was taken), and they are glued to the bottom plastic edging of the glass. </li><li>  Planks of complex shape with holes for fastening pins of plastic edging (one already shifted to the right). </li><li>  Places where glass is obviously glued. </li></ol><br>  It should start from the top, or rather from the corners where the glass is glued.  For fidelity, you can walk with something very thin along the side and top edges, but I did not notice glue there.  Disconnected from the corners of the glass should slightly lift with the display. <br><br>  Next, pay attention to the small dies under the number 1 on both edges - this is something like levers that move the strips of complex shape, freeing the pins.  Both slats are shifted to the right, if you navigate through the picture. <br><br>  Having released the pins, you can gently lift the glass, slowly peeling it off from the third gluing place in the middle of the bottom edge.  "Bridges" glass does not hold and serve more to support. <br><br>  Finally, disconnect the cables - and you can put a new glass in the reverse order.  If your hands grow from the right place, reinforce the left edge with something.  The simplest thing is to install several rubber or plastic calipers to ease the load. <br><br><h4>  Conclusions, evaluations and other epilogues </h4><br>  I am not a supporter of theories about world conspiracies, but when looking at such miracles of engineering, skepticism gives way to banal logic.  First, we will release a tablet that does not work well for one, then fix it in a new model, but spoil the other, then fix it, but make changes that are incompatible with life into the design, and so on.  Maybe everything is different, and simply ‚ÄúAsus‚Äù stupid engineers, but it is unlikely, and if so, then from the side in the long term, a series of ‚Äúomissions‚Äù looks appropriate.  By the way, judging by the reviews, the previous "transformers" did not crack in the ill-fated corner, which once again underlines the above scheme.  Unfortunately‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Oh yes, it would be nice to hear the comments of representatives of the company "Asus", if there are any.  Still, a serious mistake, especially considering the cost of the device. <br><br>  Well, if anyone is interested, then I bought a second tablet of the same color, in spite of the incident.  The old one is left as an example, and it is I who will take it with me, happen a crack in the new.  Suddenly, they will refuse to change or repair it under warranty - at least there will be a substantive conversation. <br><br>  PS: Immediately I apologize for the strange choice of sections.  Alas, there are no profile hubs for hardware or just for the topic of the article, but I cannot publish non-core hubs yet.  If possible, move where it should be. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152825/</a></p>
