  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first report from the project Devuan</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We all watched and are following the development of events around the introduction of systemd into various distributions.  There was no exception and the distribution of Linux - Debian, around which serious passions flared up. <br><br>  Part of the community dissatisfied with the introduction of systemd in Debian, proudly calling themselves Veteran Unix Admins, split from Debian.  They founded their fork Devuan, whose goal was to create a distribution with the ability to select the initialization system and protect the interests of supporters of the classical organization of the work of Debian. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a83/59f/909/a8359f909ee1486e86a75bfdc233b340.png"><br><br>  And so, on December 22, almost a month after the first announcement, the first report on the work done on the project appeared.  Below I will post the translation: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Dear lovers of freedom from the initialization system (Init Freedom lovers) <br>  The Unix Administration Veteran Team Welcomes You Again! <br>  We present to your attention a small report on the work done by the project Devuan.org, born Debianfork.org to protect and support all the oppressed systemd. <br>  This report turned out rather concise and therefore divided into subtitles:

      <b>Infrastructure</b> <br>  Many thanks to our fellow VUA - Franco Lanza for the work done.  Thanks to him, we have established an infrastructure starting from the repository and ending with servers for building packages. <br><br>  <b>Source Code Repository</b> <br>  Devuan now has its own git repository, which is not dependent on GitHub in any way, but can be used as a mirror. <br>  The project uses GitLab on <a href="https://git.devuan.org/">git.devuan.org</a> as the official repository of source files, as a wiki for documentation, planning and team-building of documents. <br>  We invite all supporters of freedom from initialization systems to develop solutions that exclude the use of systemd in our repository.  Our financial support is possible.  To get started, create an account on <a href="https://git.devuan.org/">git.devuan.org</a> and report to the # devuan-dev IRC channel (freenode IRC network). <br><br>  <b>Servers to build</b> <br>  This is the most anticipated part of our infrastructure: tonight, the first devuan-baseconf package was correctly built from the source codes taken from our repository. <br><br>  Steps such as the source code -&gt; build -&gt; package for the Devuan project are implemented on git -&gt; jenkins -&gt; dak, and they showed themselves very well in automating the process of turning the Devuan codebase into packages for a repository. <br><br>  <b>Package Repository</b> <br>  This is the first thing that we set up in the infrastructure and launched into operation.  At the moment, the repository contains the devuan-baseconf package, which has been tested in various places, including each of the servers on which Devuan is running!  <a href="http://packages.devuan.org/devuan/">packages.devuan.org/devuan</a> <br><br>  With the next update, we are planning to expand the number of packages ready for testing provided by devuan, which automatically installs on Debian 8 ‚ÄúJessie‚Äù and installs components and gaskets to replace the systemd and the default sysvinit to PID1. <br><br>  <b>Research</b> <br>  In addition to creating and maintaining our infrastructure, we also conduct research on the feasibility and strategy of free choice of initialization systems. <br><br>  <b>ConsoleKit2</b> <br>  The profile explorer named max2344 made a good contribution and created several repositories with patches for the possibility of rejecting systemd: ConsoleKit2, udisks2, policykit-1 and pcsc-lite <a href="https://github.com/max2344%3Ftab%3Drepositories">github.com/max2344?tab=repositories</a> <br>  In the near future, we want to support max2344 in its work, test and, in case of obvious benefit, integrate the code into Devuan.  In the meantime, max2344 does this in its separate repository: <a href="http://packages.psycast.de/devuan">packages.psycast.de/devuan</a> <br><br>  <b>Loginkitd (working title)</b> <br>  The study is conducted by the user Dimkr, which consists in finding a compatible, separate alternative to logind and libsystemd, which will not depend on the specific initialization system.  Loginkitd is a kind of layer, providing a logind interface, but using ConsoleKit2 as a backend. <br>  Work is proceeding at a good pace and some undocumented aspects of how logind, DBus and GDM are reported are found.  The project is available here: <a href="https://github.com/dimkr/LoginKit">github.com/dimkr/LoginKit</a> <br>  Dimkr is also the author of ‚Äúnosystem‚Äù, a tiny library that replaces libsystemd with a <a href="https://github.com/dimkr/nosystem">github.com/dimkr/nosystem</a> stub. <br>  The VUA team uses part of the donations received by the Devuan project to support Dimkr research. <br><br>  <b>libudev1</b> <br>  VUA contributor and developer Mateo Panella (Matteo Panella) is expanding the horizons of using libudev1 and plans to present its delights in the near future.  He actively participates in open technical discussions in our first dng-mailing list. <br><br>  <b>What to look at?</b> <br>  There are many projects around that are not directly used or not used in Devuan, and we monitor their activities: <br><ul><li>  eudev <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/eudev/">www.gentoo.org/proj/en/eudev</a> </li><li>  vdev <a href="https://github.com/jcnelson/vdev">github.com/jcnelson/vdev</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.freelists.org/post/modular-debian/Announcing-vdev">www.freelists.org/post/modular-debian/Announcing-vdev</a> </li><li>  uselessd <a href="http://uselessd.darknedgy.net/">uselessd.darknedgy.net</a> </li></ul><br>  After studying these projects, they will be able to count on our financial support. <br><br>  <b>What is worth reading</b> <br>  The great guys from Troubleshooters.Com, the Linux Library and Init System Ideas have released The Manjaro Experiments. <br>  The article on the Without systemd wiki contains a large number of links and information on attempts to get out of the yoke of systemd. <br><br>  <b>Financing</b> <br>  The Devuan project is financed by the Dyne.org international foundation, which is based in Amsterdam. <br>  Dyne.org prefers to conduct business transparently and will publish financial reports on our project every year. <br><br>  Our current financial report for 2014 is available at: <a href="https://devuan.org/devuan_financial_report_2014.pdf">devuan.org/devuan_financial_report_2014.pdf</a> <br><br>  We thank all those who have already made contributions or will do so in the future.  During 2015, we intend to use this cash for the release of Devuan 1.0, which will be based on Debian Jessie.  At this stage, financial support will be in great demand. <br>  There are several ways to support the Devuan project: <br><ul><li>  With Paypal - foundation@dyne.org (marked ‚ÄúVUA‚Äù) </li><li>  From the site using Stripe credit card <a href="https://devuan.org/donate.html">devuan.org/donate.html</a> </li><li>  To the bitcoin address 1QFbx3bKA8LABAGEaSe7EiP9JCxe2j4fN7 </li><li>  Via bank transfer with the description ‚Äú‚Äú VUA donation ‚Äù, for: Dyne.org, ABN-AMRO Bank (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), IBAN: NL87ABNA0406496021, BIC: ABNANL2A </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Community</b> <br>  Community Devuan is constantly growing!  Here are some numbers: <br>  IRC chat (on freenode.net) <br><ul><li>  #debianfork - has about three hundred people (general topics) </li><li>  #devuan about two hundred people (chatting around devuan) </li><li>  # devuan-dev channel just appeared.  (talk about devuan development, technical issues) </li></ul>  Mailing List (dng at <a href="https://lists.dyne.org/">lists.dyne.org</a> ) <br>  It has 343 subscribers per day, our mailing list is devoted to a review of a wide range of topics. <br>  You can subscribe and read the archive here: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/dng">mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/dng</a> </li></ul><br>  By the way, the dng is now also archived on GMane and is available via NNTP. <br>  <a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.linux.devuan.devel">dir.gmane.org/gmane.linux.devuan.devel</a> <br><br>  <b>Localization</b> <br>  The initiative to translate information about the Devuan project was brought to life immediately and we are grateful to everyone who showed up (proved himself to be in it? Or who was involved in this?).  The French site <a href="https://devuan.fr/">Devuan.fr</a> already has the translated main page of our main site. Also, there is a domain Devuan.de, which is translated and mirrored by the contents of the main site.  Anyone who has the desire can join and run the site in their native language. <br><br>  <b>Logo</b> <br>  Quite a large number of threads in the mailing list is devoted to the Devuan logo and options for submitting a project.  So far this task is not a priority for us and we appreciate the enthusiasm and quality of the logo options you send. <br>  Check out the logos gallery on the Without-systemd wiki. <br>  <a href="http://without-systemd.org/wiki/index.php/Category">without-systemd.org/wiki/index.php/Category</a> : Logo <br>  Alban Crommer publishes logo design tips for Devuan <br>  <a href="http://albancrommer.github.io/devuan/Logo.pdf">albancrommer.github.io/devuan/Logo.pdf</a> <br>  <a href="http://albancrommer.github.io/devuan/">albancrommer.github.io/devuan</a> <br>  Thank you all!  When it comes time to release the 1.0 version of the distribution, we will choose the best!  Until now, many people have responded positively about galactic designs in sets from Alban and Petrik. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/767/0ab/984/7670ab9846ba414481772bf27b2fbf27.png"><br><br>  <b>What to do with the trolls</b> <br>  We should not get involved in disputes around systemd and feed the negative emotions of the trolls who live on thematic resources.  In our Devuan project, we used the Debianfork declaration, in which we tried to reflect all possible attacks from systemd-fanatics and, for our part, impose a constructive discussion on the technical aspects of software solutions. <br>  We urge the community formed around Devuan to take this seriously and avoid aggressive behavior.  Each of us must operate with facts, but not with aggressive personal attacks on opponents. <br><br>  Recently, several threads were noticed in the mailing list, where everyone involved in the Devuan project was called fraudsters.  It is better to approach such topics with all attention and give answers in as much detail as possible so as not to fall for the bait, and also not to discredit the project for yourself and others. <br>  We have repeatedly observed how some members of the community are trying to respond to attacks from the trolls in such a way that it can reach physical violence.  The VUA team, the Dyne.org Foundation and its representative Denis Roio (Denis Roio), who was also the target of harassment, do not take part in such measures, do not approve of them and do not want to be associated with them in any way.  We will continue to do everything we can to participate in the Devuan project without personal risk, and we encourage community members to do the same to keep the trolls ‚Äúhungry.‚Äù <br>  We will continue to do everything we can to ensure that the Devuan project remains without negative intervention.  We urge members of all communities to give up conflicts.  Leave the trolls alone and ignore them. <br>  We will actively maintain order in the mailing list and IRC channels with the help of a growing number of volunteers to prevent such situations. <br>  And, finally, we applaud and we smile broadly over how the twitter account @shitdevuansays parodies our project.  We understand that the account holder supports systemd and we are not offended by it, but rather thank you for contributing to the popularization of Devuan. <br><br>  <b>This is all guys!</b> <br>  ... And thanks for the support and participation that you are implementing.  We end this report with a funny comic from Commitstrip.com called Systemd World: the Park is open with the participation of our Devuan project: we have the honor to sit next to Slackware, this ancient and respectable GNU / Linux distribution.  This seems to be quite cool even for Unix veterans: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/704/813/698/704813698c6f40b5a35592a91df5d225.png"><br><br>  Contact us at onelove@devuan.org </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247945/</a></p>
