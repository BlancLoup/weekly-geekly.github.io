In addition to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/193422/">ninth promotion of the Humble Indie Bundle</a> launched a week ago, the sale of X-series toys started today. <br><br>  Under the cut the details, as well as a small educational program, for those who are already confused in these promotions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/392/204/dd6/392204dd688c067c0f3e6ee88b24fbdd.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  What are the sets of the Humble Bundle </h5><br>  I am sure that there are few people in Habr√© who have never heard of the Humble Bundle promotions.  Shares are held with enviable regularity and news about them appears on a variety of resources.  Habrahabr community does not ignore them, especially recently.

      Sales are on the principle of "pay-what-you-want", i.e.  You can pay any amount.  Usually, there is a piece of content in the set that is available only by paying more than a certain amount. <br><br>  Starting with two-week sales of non-DRM cross-platform indie toys, the company has significantly expanded its range of promotions.  In order not to be confused in all this diversity, we will try to sort them out. <br><br>  There are three main types of shares: <br><ol><li>  <b>Humble Indie Bundle.</b>  It all started with her, now it can be said a classic.  Two-week sale of cross-platform (Windows, Mac and Linux) indie toys.  It is possible to download a version without DRM and there are keys for Steam.  For most games, a soundtrack is included in the set, sometimes there are some other bonuses, like books, concept art, etc.  Some games are available only to those who paid more than the average amount (usually $ 4-6).  A week after the start, a few more toys are added to the set that are available to those who bought more than the average for the amount (earlier, all those who bought the first week received additional toys).  There is one type: Humble Android Bundle, the difference of which is only in the presence of additional versions for Android. </li><li>  <b>All other Humble Bundle with games.</b>  In most cases, these are games from a specific developer or publisher.  Here you can not only cross-platform games, but often with the version only under Windows, the version without DRM may not be (only the keys for Steam or Origin), soundtracks and other goodies are often missing.  But the duration is the same and for the second week the set is also expanding. </li><li>  <b>Humble Weekly Sale.</b>  These shares run in parallel with the main one (which is the Bundle) and are held almost every week.  It looks like the previous view, but has a number of differences.  There is a week, additional games are not added.  Some games are available if you pay more than a predetermined amount (not average). </li></ol><br>  In addition, there were more sales of e-books, music and speeches stand-up comedians. <br><br>  Having dealt with all this zoo, we will look more closely at our present beast. <br><br><h5>  What's in this release </h5><br>  And in this weekly sale, we have a well-known series of space simulator with elements of trading (space trading) from Egosoft - X. In this issue, only keys for Steam are sold, which means the minimum cost is $ 1.  The set includes such games (version only under Windows, unless otherwise indicated): <br><ol><li>  X: Beyond the Frontier </li><li>  X-Tension </li><li>  X2: The Threat </li><li>  X3: Reunion + Bonus Package (Windows, Mac and Linux) </li></ol><br>  In addition, we will receive a soundtrack for the upcoming X Rebirth. <br><br>  If you pay $ 6 or more, then we will be given more toys: <br><ol><li>  X3: Terran Conflict (Windows, Mac and Linux) </li><li>  X3: Albion Prelude (Windows, Mac and Linux) + Sandtrack </li></ol><br>  As well as a 300-page encyclopedia and a whole DVD with bonus content. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rKEnCYsU47Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhtKGTb-mcSEbtkiRSEzteGBkxwcw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  If you are not confused by the availability of versions only for Steam, then those who wish to purchase the missing games, join the X series or simply replenish the collection can be <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/weekly">safely taken</a> . <br><br>  PS: Running parallel to the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Indie Bundle 9</a> yesterday added four new toys. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194452/</a></p>
