Princesses?</i>  <i>The princesses will be.</i>  <i>And dragons too.</i>  <i>What a fairy tale without princesses and dragons?</i>  <i>So we are not afraid, we close our eyes and listen to the fairy tale ...</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/345/3e9/4bb/3453e94bbf4c11689de9f2ab7a8710ce.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - In the name of Prince Peter, give here a declaration.  What we carry?  From where <br>  - From Novosibirsk.  256 megabytes of certified data for the Internet by His Excellency.  Scientific, meteorological, news, business and private correspondence, - I reported, knowing that customs does not like to joke. <br>  - Open, we'll see. <br>  - What, all 256 megabytes will you watch? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Open, we will understand ... <br>  Get out of the cab, I'm going to open the container.  The children are gay.  I have an official St. Petersburg license to carry data.  All data neatly sealed Novosibirsk customs.  Not diplomatic mail, of course, but the relationship between Peter and Novosibirsk is, on the whole, friendly.  It was hoped that his own, dear St. Petersburg customs would miss without inspection. <br>  ‚ÄúRaid against piracy,‚Äù the customs officer finally explained, as if apologizing. <br>  - Well, look, your work ... <br>  It is a pity that I cannot pull off the pressure mask and, with a sweet smile, wink at the officer.  We have to pitch, changing the voice of the hardware and not waiting for indulgence. <br>  The customs officer extended a thick and heavy lead sleeve from his booth to the body of my KAMAZ, forcefully shoved the connector into the 256-megabyte ‚ÄúWestern HydroMechanical‚Äù slot and launched the bloodhound.  Micro-gears of the propeller often pounded under the lead plating. <br>  A good bloodhound shoveled a quarter gig over forty.  That there was a good bloodhound at St. Petersburg customs, I had no doubt.  However, Berta, my watchdog, will look after her, so I was not afraid of throwing up counterfeit. <br><br>  Data collection is a profitable, but nervous job for a fragile independent girl.  The hardest part was to forge a license.  And I lent plutonium KAMAZ from my father.  Not poorer.  Recently, however, one clever man suggested to the pope to connect the principalities by wide channels through which data flow.  That will be expanse for pirates: who will protect these channels?  Other smart guys scare, saying the background radiation is reduced, and soon it will be possible to exchange radio signals again.  Fuck you.  For my life, there will be enough megabytes for carriers.  The main thing is not to burn on counterfeit.  Many were scorched.  After all, the transportation of pirated files can be enriched in one moment. <br><br>  ...- Well, well, well.  Come on come. <br>  The customs officer beckoned me to his booth. <br>  - What is it with you?  - He poked the same finger at the screen. <br>  On the mechanical needle monitor flaunted unknown slab.  Service information at the bottom of the screen reported that this is a file 013.jpg from my screw. <br>  ‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù I honestly admitted.  - Dystrophic boa, tail support head?  Children's kalyaki-malyaki.  From private correspondence the same? <br>  - Are you kidding me?  Three hundred kilobytes of children's kalyak-malyak ?!  Princely daughter something to draw? <br>  - Surely she.  Golden youth ... - I said convincingly, trying to cling to the saving straw. <br>  ‚ÄúOkay, the expertise will figure it out.‚Äù

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/378/aac/439/378aac439f3f9d4cfbecf7d297b62b6e.jpg"><br>  Nuclear ammunition!  Because of such garbage - for examination?  I cursed an artist unknown to me (quite possibly a princely daughter) who painted this nonsense and sent the devil knows who to Peter.  Expertise is bad.  Very bad.  First of all, the KB examination will find out that no customs snoop - the undocumented tank inside the screw carefully guarded by Bertha - will smell: 16 decalitres of counterfeit data.  Secondly ... For the time being, ‚Äúfirst‚Äù is enough for me.  What exactly is the hidden section filled in, I don‚Äôt know, and I‚Äôll give a lot to find out not because of the St. Petersburg prince security. <br><br>  Well, the license, I think, profukala.  To save his life unlucky. <br>  It is good that my pressure mask is on me.  This gave a dozen seconds of odds to the customs officer, who unscrewed the heavy helmet, going into the booth.  I rushed to KAMAZ.  In a civilian spacesuit, you don‚Äôt bother too much, but I tried.  Siren howled when I was sitting behind the wheel.  I turned the key and pressed the pedal to the floor.  My truck is not a glamor SUV with a shielded cab in which it is necessary to throw a scuff. <br>  The plutonium engine is rickety for 2 microseconds.  The wheels screeched, the car jerked up, something hryatnuv behind.  I really thought they were firing at me after the stalks of yadrenamatov, en-no.  Good connectors for WH, durable.  For my typewriter jumped on a three-meter lead leash MIM - mechanical needle monitor.  Hopefully, the customs officer was already in helmets when his booth collapsed.  I may be a cybercriminal, but not a murderer. <br>  But the bloodhound is not a pity to me.  I gave the command to Bertha to strangle this stupid bastard, who has a nose for abstract painting ... <br><br>  Chase was not.  It seems no one expected such a trick from me.  Where to wind - the question was not.  Now I was a direct way only to the base to the pirates.  First, when the St. Petersburg KB awakens - no one, except Anonymus, will hide from it.  Secondly, in the hidden tank of the screw there were files of these guys.  And if they find out that their files have leaked to some unknown place without getting to the customer, finding and crashing me before CB-Schnick will be a matter of their honor.  It is better to return everything voluntarily.  Let them merge files back into their caches.  It is unlikely that they will be pleased.  But I'm not empty-handed to them.  Tea, among the 250 certified megabytes, there will be something more valuable than the winner of the daub competition among juvenile downs.  What is not useful, will have to pour.  It's a shame, of course.  Though I grew up in a non-poor family, but even with us, everyone strictly followed the rule: if the file downloaded from the Internet was not useful, fill it back.  And then the cubic meters of data - in the mother of raw earth.  But nothing can be done. <br><br>  After such experiences, I wanted to relieve myself, which I did, spewing out a stream of rainbow light.  The civilian spacesuit reacted in a standard way, whistling in surprise with empty pipes.  Sorry, dear, shit won't.  Princesses do not poop. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Prince St. Petersburg and Putinburger again pressed F5.  Pipe whistles on duty.  The operational tank was emptied and refilled.  The same content. <br>  - Again, F5 from empty to empty!  - His Excellency swore and hit fist on F1. <br>  An adviser appeared in the doorway. <br>  ‚ÄúAlready eleven,‚Äù the prince growled.  - Why is the Internet still not updated? <br>  - Only Novosibirsk segment, Emge.  Data packets did not reach. <br>  Well for ...!  Only the prince knew why he was waiting for news from the Novosibirsk carrier. <br>  - The carrier got caught on smuggling and rushed into a run.  Data remained with him.  His search is engaged in your KB, Emge. <br>  Philip Luchezarny, being yesterday in a complacent mood, graciously allowed to replace in the reports the inaudible ‚ÄúGracious Sovereign‚Äù with an abbreviation, and only now he realized how silly and familiarly it sounds. <br>  ‚ÄúThe loss report has already been sent to Novosibirsk by the post office,‚Äù the adviser continued.  ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll get lost packages in about a week, Emge.‚Äù <br>  - A week ?!  - The Prince's eyes flashed bright light, and the stream of infrared radiation escaped from the mouth reached the parquet and burned a fresh mark on it.  - What do you call the broadband high-speed Internet ?!  Who promised me six months ago to expand the channel with the Luberetsko-Butovo Principality to 2 gigabytes per day?  BUT?! <br>  ‚ÄúNot enough cars, Emge ...‚Äù <br>  - My dear sir!  - irritated corrected radiant. <br>  - Not enough cars, Dear Sir.  Have mercy that I did not report to you right away, along with Her Highness Princess Anna from the Princely Stable one more plutonium KAMAZ disappeared. <br>  - Not a word about princesses!  - Philip snapped.  - Until you catch both !!! <br>  - Yes, most gracious sovereign ... <br>  - What is new with clever men? <br>  - Disappointing news, Dear Sir.  The background is dropping.  Another 10 micro-roentgen per hour drop in the last 24 hours ... <br>  ‚ÄúIt seems to me that I will soon feel this with my own skin ... And I can see how you smile there, under the helmet, cunningly ass your face.‚Äù  But you will not wait, gnawing corpses and shitty shit.  On our age with you radiation is enough. <br>  Another princely burp melted down the refractory parquet, and a volley of eyes tested the strength of the adviser's spacesuit.  The suit withstood the onslaught.  What can not be said about the adviser.  In the pipes of his scaffold purl came on duty, and not any data flowed through them. <br><br>  *** <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a9/480/b13/6a9480b1351969a4cb60da6e1ced5ad1.jpg"><br>  The captain of the pirate base was sitting right on the floor of the shelter, holding one of the heavy legs under him, and feeding the fireflies.  The little finger of his glove, from which grains of radioactive frost were falling ‚Äî the favorite delicacy of the bright-winged ‚Äî was ridiculously sticking out.  I remembered how the governess blurted out to us that we needed to stick out little fingers when my sister and I played with ancient noble princesses and pretended to drink hot liquid from small porcelain cups.  Masha was furious and almost burned the governess with a look: my sister had no little fingers in her arms since her birth.  Princess Maria was hot-tempered at all (although I now remembered that I had never seen her burn someone with a figurative look, but really) and ran away from home a year before me when my father‚Äôs paranoia became unbearable ... <br>  I leaked the pirates all the data that brought with me.  Their servers have now been loaded to the full and spinning their gears wildly.  Some results of the initial processing have already been reported to the captain. <br>  ‚ÄúThe radiation background is decreasing, Your Highness ...‚Äù <br>  Dragon shit!  How does he know who I am ?! <br>  ‚ÄúYou can take off your spacesuit,‚Äù the cap confirmed.  ‚ÄúYou don't need him.‚Äù <br>  My physiology, like all noble ladies, has been tweaked with a very successful mutation.  We are not afraid of radiation.  Moreover, we cannot live without it: it is our bread.  Our skin absorbs gamma radiation, the body digests it and produces less energy-intensive waves at the output: light and heat.  From my eyes, mouth and other ... physiological holes ... And my sister, for example, when she was in a good mood, her hair was flowing with soft light.  But people called us ‚Äúdragons‚Äù for this.  Of course, out of envy and anger.  Not being shackled by heavy spacesuits and excessive stiffness, my ancestors quickly took power over people in their hands.  "Dragon Princess".  This oxymoron would have turned the brains of ancient storytellers inside out. <br>  ‚ÄúWe will not need scouts soon, either,‚Äù Cap said with conviction. <br>  ‚ÄúAnd we will die out,‚Äù I quietly stated, unscrewing the unnecessary disguise.  I was in no hurry to get naked in front of the pirate, but I was pretty tired of the pressure mask. <br>  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs enough radiation for your age, girl.‚Äù  But your relatives can become extinct before the background returns to normal.  Human norm, he specified.  ‚ÄúIf they are as stupid as your father.‚Äù <br>  - Well, as I understand it, I also have not long to live? <br>  ‚ÄúWhy would I kill such a beautiful girl who escaped from her father-tyrant?‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt seems that for the first time he was distracted from his fireflies and looked at me.‚Äù  However, I will not be able to look inside his helmet. <br>  - Be aware, I will not give you rape! <br>  - It will not be easy for me to do it in the scaffold.  As you can see, our base is poorly protected from radiation, which means it is quite suitable for you.  You can stay here. <br>  - As a hostage?  You will hardly be able to blackmail my dad with my health and life.  We sooo strongly argued. <br>  - As a guest.  Until.  Maybe then agree to become our carrier?  You have a great car with a top-notch propeller. <br>  - A. Well, yes.  You need a carrier.  And you ... You threw a damn suspicious graphic file with shit into the open section of the screw. <br>  - This is not shit, this is a mitt. <br>  - What? <br>  - Mitenko.  Fingerless glove.  These were worn to the Cataclysm.  And some noble people after him.  People, you know, they do not need anything.  Previously, to send someone a glove meant to call into battle.  It was hello to your dad. <br>  ‚ÄúYou threw this file at me so that I could be burned at the customs, and I came running to you ...‚Äù I missed his lecture. <br>  - Arrived.  No, it was not in my plans.  But it also turned out well. <br>  - And if it didn‚Äôt work out ?!  - I boiled.  - If I did not run away from customs? <br>  ‚ÄúWell, you would be returned to your father.‚Äù  Live and healthy.  It was worth a try.  Although it is unlikely that ordinary customs officers had chances against the princess. <br>  - You still did not make a carrier for yourself.  I don‚Äôt take the data to the city now.  My license has already been revoked, and she was fake. <br>  - Nothing, we still have a reliable connection with the city.  Firefly mail. <br>  - kidding me. <br>  The fireflies ‚Äî whether devils, or fairies, small creatures with black-skinned calves ‚Äî glowed brightly in the twilight of the basement tunnel with their thin wings and flashed through the often flashing wide-eyed facets that replaced their faces.  The only, except for us, fights ... noble people, animals that have adapted to radiation.  They only ate not background radiation, but radioactive hoarfrost, generously ground in the mornings.  But the fireflies were stupid, besides, they would hardly have taken at least a kilobyte little chest in their paws, so they were absolutely useless for transmitting information. <br>  - I'm not kidding.  We found out that the blinking of their facets depends on the properties of the frost they feed on.  By feeding the specially prepared frost crystals, we load the data into the fireflies.  Moreover, we also load the flight program with them.  Look ... <br>  The cap fed one of the fireflies to another crystal, and it flew like a bullet to a nearby server, stuck it with a slubel facet into the hole of the connector that fit it perfectly and zamelteshil. <br>  - In a server there is an ancient device - a photo modem, - for some reason, the cap continued his explanations.  ‚ÄúIt decrypts the flash of the firefly and translates it into data.‚Äù  One little animal can only transfer up to a kilobyte of data.  But we have a whole firefly "farm" ... <br>  As if in confirmation of his words, behind the captain one of the pirates carried the firefly egg somewhere shining in steady blue light. <br>  - I see.  Listen, why do you need me?  You have fireflies.  You now have my KAMAZ with a quarter-gigabyte screw ... <br>  ‚Äú... And your guard guards him.‚Äù <br>  Well yes!  How could I forget?!  Berta ... Good dog.  Wonderful dog!  Never before had such affection for the watchdog. <br>  ‚ÄúSorry, I am hungry,‚Äù said the cap, went to the wall, pressed a button and inserted the nozzle of his suit into the opening. <br>  - What is your name, captain? <br>  ‚ÄúMark,‚Äù he reluctantly muttered after a second pause.  Probably his mouth was already filled with this mucus, which people emit when preparing to eat. <br>  - And me, Anna. <br>  Well, yes, surprised.  Who does not know the name of the Princess of St. Petersburg.  Mark did not answer.  Some human stuff was already running through the pipes.  I would not want to know which one.  I heard from papa that people do not disdain the stuffing from the corpses of their fellows.  Not everyone learned how to do without protein food, and after the Cataclysm, there was tension with it. <br>  ‚ÄúVery nice, damn it,‚Äù I swore. <br>  Unable to get used to this spectacle with a physiological bias, I turned away ... <br><br>  *** <br><br>  - For stuffing!  All for minced comin!  I know how you love to eat each other, carnivores! <br>  Taking a strontium bath, Philip Luchetarny came to an even more excited state.  Metal lightning is not figuratively. <br>  ‚ÄúFirst of all, clever men for mince,‚Äù the Prince would not let go.  - Nichrome do not think.  I!  I myself have guessed why the background is falling.  And found a way to settle everything.  Himself!  Found!!! <br>  The newly appeared Archimedes jumped out of the bath in what was (yes, in nothing was) and ran into the throne room. <br>  - Divorced ... Eh, divorced us more than needed ... Noble ... So we translate the life-giving scale into a shitty rainbow.  Such a background we shit!  No joke, two hundred X-rays!  From grandfathers got.  And we slay ... Well, nothing, some will fall under my staff reduction ... How many nuclear charges do we have, advisor? <br>  - One large, one medium, a dozen super-small. <br>  - On Sunday, there will be a banquet for nobles at the training ground.  Cook medium ... no, cook big!  Walk - so walk.  You will fill up with me! .. <br>  - My dear sir, the range is not designed for charges greater than 100 kilotons.  Tribunes collapse.  And I'm not only afraid of the stands.  The palace of your Excellency will also get it. <br>  - Build a new one. <br>  - But, Emge, a large charge - this is NZ!  Your grandmother's family value! <br>  - The old lady is no longer useful. <br>  - We took care of the average for special occasions, and the ultra-small ones - for the New Year ... <br>  - Let them remain: medium - for special occasions, ultra-low - for the New Year.  Everything, adviser, prepare fireworks until I cooked a well-done cutlet out of you for the joy of your relatives.  Notify: the presence of all the noble ladies of the principality is obligatory!  But it is not necessary for anyone to know about the charge size, is that understandable?  And another thing, - added the prince, looking out the window, - order the retainers to shoot all the fireflies.  These creatures also translate the product ... <br>  The counselor shook his head, as far as the helmet allowed, and left.  Strontium baths do not benefit the sovereign.  Trying to walk carefully so as not to crush the fireproof tile with a heavy scaf, the adviser went into the bathroom and pulled the stopper out of the bowl.  Radioactive liquid flowed through the pipes. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  ‚ÄúGood morning, Your Highness.‚Äù  I have a gift for you. <br>  Mark entered without knocking.  Actually, there was nothing to knock on: there were no doors in the cells of the pirate refuge. <br>  - Turn around! <br>  Cap, obediently and very awkwardly, turned his back on me.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In cell cramping in the bulky scaffold, you don‚Äôt particularly develop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Behind him was a healthy backpack. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With a gift, as I understand it. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I got out of a sleeping bag and put on light armor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, a sleeping bag and armor - all the belongings that I captured, having escaped from my paternal home. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not counting the truck and thousands with a tail of coins. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So I was accepting gifts complacently. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You can turn around. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dari. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was not mistaken. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mark took off his backpack, untied and dumped a pile of scrap metal on the floor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Looking closely, I guessed it iron dog. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Big iron dog. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Very cute. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have not been given toys since the age of twelve. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is sucking up to me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gives toys. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's nice, I will not hide. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- This is not a simple toy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can pour your watch program into it.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Bertu? </font></font> Wow.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you know how? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, and also add a couple of useful functions to it, in order to protect not only the data, but also Your Highness. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWell, with Highness, it was you who invented it well, but it would be easier for her to protect the data while sitting in the hard drive, n'est-ce pas? - I flashed good manners and subtle irony. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI wanted to talk to you about this.‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">His sudden transitions from ‚Äúyou‚Äù to ‚Äúyou‚Äù confused me, but for some reason they did not make me angry, but ... on the contrary ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- We will need carrier services earlier than we expected. Actually, we need to urgently deliver a data packet to Peter. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAnd how does this relate to Berta?‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The data is already in it. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In Berta? - it was impossible to show off instantaneous acumen.</font></font><br>  - Yes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">16 megabytes. Too much even for a whole farm of fireflies. In addition, the Prince's guards began to shoot them. Losing half a pack. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúSo why not deliver the data by truck?‚Äù You can fake a license, I know people ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- It is difficult and unreliable. After your yesterday's escape, prince security is on duty at customs. They check much more carefully. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAnd how do you think I‚Äôll get into the city?‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThrough the front gate.‚Äù The return of the prodigal daughter to the father's house in front of the amazed public. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Hmm. Last question. Why do I need it? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mark did not have time to answer. The siren roared. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Anxiety! - It was carried by tunnels. - Special Forces KB two kilometers from the base. Three dozen horsemen and light armored car. " </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúFive minutes to be here.‚Äù Must have time!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cap was overly persistent for the princess's boyfriend, whom I imagined when he gave a hint about a gift (by the way, Mark did not forget about it, stuffing the iron dog back into the backpack). But for the captain of the pirates, my cavalier, it must be admitted, was very unfriendly. Gently squeezing my hand, he confidently dragged me along the intricate corridors of the base, demonstrating meritorious agility for a man in a heavy spacesuit. I, in light armor, barely kept up with him. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I understand, this is just a game of hormones in my young body, and the result of a long absence of any gentlemen nearby ... And it‚Äôs impossible to fall in love with a person with whom I have known for less than a day and whose face I have never seen, but ... It didn‚Äôt matter what exactly we should have done. I really wanted to make it.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Having run through half a dozen tunnel corridors, we found ourselves in a bunker where my KAMAZ stood. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, revive your puppy? - Mark winked at me, shook the pieces of iron out of the backpack and connected them with a thick cable to the ‚ÄúWestern HydroMickel‚Äù connector. - Climb into the cabin and just give the watchdog command to unload through the main port. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I obeyed, deciding that at a critical moment it is better to rely on a man. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cable gurgled ...</font></font><br><br>  *** <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Dear Sir, Your Excellency Prince of Petersburg and Putinburger! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your Excellency has received a report from the Privy Councilor of Your Excellency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your Excellency, Prince's Security discovered the base of the wicked pirates near the St. Petersburg-Novosibirsk Union-Princely trail. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They went out on the trail of the carrier, who yesterday escaped with packages for the Novosibirsk Internet servers of Your Excellency!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The new adviser was excessively tall and obviously stupid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">His verbose tongues resolutely did not fit into the crowned head. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those who are smarter, long ago kept away from the palace. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Philip became even more angry with the former adviser, who had to be burned to the ground because he turned out to be a saboteur and poured out all the precious strontium water from the prince's baths.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among other things, the issue with the preparation of a Sunday surprise. If we betrayed the old adviser who served as a grandfather, then there is absolutely no one to trust in the principality. Both daughters have escaped and are now hanging out where they don‚Äôt know, and the other relatives of Radiant, according to the old dragon ... of the princely tradition, killed by their own fire, leaving himself an orphan when he was a tender youth. There was, of course, another Martha ... Oh, Martha, my wife, my mother's children ... Philip thoughtfully looked at the high tower, where an electric light burned in a barred window, on which fireflies flew in swarms. Wow, the palace is brightly lit with electricity, but the fireflies prefer the dim light of a night lamp in a distant tower. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúTell me, Counselor, does the electricity flow into Princess Marta‚Äôs tower from the palace generator?‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- My dear Sovereign ...</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You can just "Emge". </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The gracious sovereign Emge. Yes, Your Excellency, electricity for the tower of Princess Marta is produced by a palace generator. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Does the generator convert the background radiation into electricity? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Grace ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- YES OR NO!?! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, Your Excellency. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I think we should be more thrifty in order to preserve the natural radiation background inherited from our grandfathers. Unplug the tower from the generator!</font></font><br>      ,    ‚Äî      ,      .    ‚Äî         ,      ,    .            (    ,        ,   ).   ,   ,           (      !),          . ,         ‚Ä¶        ‚Ä¶      ‚Ä¶     ?.. <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thunder struck when Mary was born. Pervenka adopted her mother's deformities. Later, of course, Philip regretted that he had incinerated in the hearts of the inventor-in-law on his daughter's birthday. Besides him, no one knew the secrets of the noble masquerade, who had been leading the prince and his retinue for almost a year. Martha's eyes and hair no longer emitted the magic light that had conquered Philip. Only the daughter sometimes left the room of the princess with shining eyes and hair; but the prince could not find out how she did it, or make her walk so constantly. The girl had to hide from the eyes of the courtyard and servants. Like her mother. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second princess, Anna, was no longer a flower of love, but the fruit of power and coercion. But it turned out normal, healthy. However, the character of both daughters were in the mother.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nevertheless, the father pinned great hopes on the princess Anna, tried to educate a worthy noble person and ordered to keep the disability of her sister and mother secret. The future princess should be relieved of the burden of inferiority of her origin. The harder for Philip was the betrayal of Anna. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was an unforgivable mistake to allow a beloved daughter to sometimes play with a wretched sister, who was specially released from the locked tower of her mother. Ungrateful Maria escaped on one of these days and set a bad example to noble Anna.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, God sees, the prince was ready to forgive his favorite. And when some anonymous author in the princely Internet promised Philip that with the next update of the Novosibirsk servers he would receive greetings from his daughter, Luchezarny did not doubt that Anna had changed his mind and wanted to ask for forgiveness. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Damned carrier! damn customs! damn security !!!</font></font><br>     ,    .    ¬´¬ª     . . ,    ,    -  ,    . -    ,                . .  ,  ,     ,    .      ‚Äî    . <br>  ,     ,  ,  ,  .         ¬´      ¬ª. <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Philip Radiant sat at the keyboard and opened the valve. The hose cable gurgled, bits and bytes flowed. The prince's computer established the Internet connection of His Excellency.</font></font><br><br>  *** <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The hose last gurgled and fell silent. The Storozhev program overflowed from a special section on the hard drive into a mechanical toy. However, she remained lifeless. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I looked at Mark inquiringly, but at that moment something gurgled already in the little dog and a trickle of steam escaped from the iron maw. The metal beast raised one ear and opened one eye. Moved by the pupil, it seems he saw me. He pressed his hind legs and finally climbed all four. Suddenly, he spun wildly with his head and body from neck to tail. As if trying to throw off something. "It would not have spilled the data," - I thought. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well turned out doggy. Like a real one. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Have you seen real dogs? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Mom's in the video library. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Do people have video libraries? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúNot only dragons.‚Äù</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was ready to be offended, but at this moment the dog came up to me, stood on its hind legs, putting the front on my shoulders and vigorously wagged its tail. Offended by anyone else got sick. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI recognized you,‚Äù said the captain. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I found out. Her name is Berta. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, now listen ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whatever Mark was going to tell me, he was interrupted by a roar coming from above. The underground base trembled with all the walls and floors. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Nuclear warheads. Ultra small charge. Damn, KB-Schnick serious as ever. Run through this tunnel, - cap pointed to the direction - He has a disguised way out almost at the city itself. When you enter Peter, let Berta go for a walk for a couple of hours, she knows what needs to be done.</font></font><br>  - And you? <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mark listened to the sounds coming from above. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The guys have already taken the fight. I am needed here. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Mark ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Run the march! - The captain of the pirate base barked, and I could not disobey. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bertha, making loud sounds, rushed forward. When they ran into the twilight of the tunnel, the dog's eyes flashed brightly. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Stop, Berta! Wait here, - unexpectedly for myself, I commanded. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, these are just hormones, but I should at least peck Him in the helmet for a farewell. I turned and ran back. Having run into the bunker, I stopped dead. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mark, standing with his back to me, squeezed a heavy helmet. Another second - that's all. He will receive a radiation dose incompatible with human life. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Mark! ..</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He quickly turned to me, the helmet was already in his hands. A mop of glowing hair broke loose ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Masha? !!! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Anka, why did you come back? - the sister asked me in her usual, not changed by the apparatus of the pressure helmet, voice. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now I did not have time to answer. It shook and rattled even more, a hole was formed in the ceiling of the bunker - and two special forces officers in light armor jumped into it. Mar ... Masha was still in a heavy suit, the forces were unequal. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What the fuck! Was it the best sensei that taught the noble princess a light fight ?! Who dared to attack my beloved sister ?!</font></font><br>   ,  -   ,    -       .  ,   .      ,  .     .             . <br>   .       ,     .    ,         .         ,    ,       -,    (     ). ,       , ‚Ä¶ <br>   .     ¬´  ¬ª,    .      .  ¬´¬ª,  ‚Ä¶ <br>       .   -         ,           ! <br><br> ‚Äî  -, ‚Äî  . ‚Äî    ,   ‚Ä¶ <br>      ,       ‚Ä¶ <br><br>  *** <br><br> ‚Äî  ,      !                    ! <br>  - What?!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Philip looked at his watch in confusion, now through the window, from which a beautiful view of the test site, now at the adviser. - Take them away immediately ... No, enter! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We entered, accompanied by two fighters KB. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dad looked at us with that very long, unblinking look that is about to break out. I cringe under this look, as if in childhood. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In silence, the noise of the crowd was heard at the site. All the aristocracy of the principality was going to the pir-fireworks. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Masha first out of stupor. Looking into her father‚Äôs eyes, she slowly took off her glove and threw the prince under her feet. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What is it? - Father raised his mitt and, it seems, found out. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I remembered that picture. But it seems. How did I not immediately see? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThis is ... a palace coup, papa.‚Äù</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Daughter, have you completely lost your mind? In their underground prison! Both! Into the deepest protected camera! - shouted the prince of KB-Schnick, but they did not budge. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Sentry! - called father. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The guard was tired, daddy. You are left all alone. Now you will write a renunciation of the princely throne and go deservedly to rest in the tower. - Maria pointed to her mother's abode. Despite the lack of electricity, it was bright from the fireflies who were swarming on both sides of the window - It‚Äôs time to change the local resident. Then we will close the door behind you and do not interfere. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Father was blown away instantly. I did not even expect. He looked at his watch again, nodded to some of his thoughts and uttered in a completely colorless voice: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúOkay ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But then he broke into a cry: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Äú I have a paper, quickly! ‚Äù</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The adviser brought a pen, real paper (I thought it was gone!) And an official stamp. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In favor of whom to write a renunciation? .. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And at that moment it rattled. Father pressed into the throne and closed his eyes. The walls of the hall lit up with colorful lights. It was a flash of an explosion that was not a super-large or even an ultra-small charge. Conventional nuclear pyrotechnics.</font></font><br>  - What?  Like this? <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The prince became quite miserable. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Just a firework for loyal subjects in honor of the accession to the prince's throne of the new monarch. Have you been waiting for a local Big Bang, daddy? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Did you know? But from where? I ... all by myself. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWhen the mistress is in the house,‚Äù Masha pointedly looked at her mother‚Äôs tower, ‚Äúshe knows everything that happens in her.‚Äù Even if he is locked up. And if she is still a bit of a sysadmin ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- But ... - the father looked like a little rogue who was caught hot and spoiled the best rally. - After all, only I have a password from the polygon server. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, every dog ‚Äã‚Äãknows him in the principality! - Masha laughed, and it was true. With the only proviso that in the principality there was only one dog. Wonderful dog!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Outside the door came a joyous barking. Berta heard that we were talking about her and forgot about the command ‚ÄúSit! Quiet! ‚ÄùThe </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">prince gathered his last strength. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You did not say in whose favor to deny. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Masha and I exchanged glances. Somehow we forgot to discuss it. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You are the eldest, Masha, you are the crown princess. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, which of me is a princess, Anka! - My sister winked at me. - Princesses do not poop. Just please order to install toilets in the palace ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The pipes of the palace orchestra roared at the testing ground. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here and the fairy tale is the end, and the end of the world, and the end is over!
