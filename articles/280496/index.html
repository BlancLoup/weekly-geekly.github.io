  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As I wrote skad. Part Seven</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yes, yes, good day! <br>  Long time I did not sit behind the wheel of this vacuum cleaner ... This is me about writing articles on Habr.  Yes, the period of my absence is already serious, and sometimes they begin to blame me for completely missing.  But, I have not disappeared, I seem to have plunged quite thoroughly and things are not even as fast as we would like, but they are going and even make a profit, which at this stage of the project becomes a kind of butter for bread, not only for me.  And the system continues to evolve and plans are being built in such a way that I understand that they will be difficult to implement even by a small team.  But first things first‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, those who were interested in the fate of the project earlier and followed it, ask me the same question: ‚Äúwhat now?  Does it live? ‚Äù  Yes, the company, on the basis of which my friends and I decided to make ‚Äúthis‚Äù a commercial product and begin to put on production rails - it worked. <br>  I am very pleased that the system, before entering the market, was not just ‚Äúdrawn‚Äù from scratch and presented to the market, but afterwards there was a series of many years of work on errors, it was ‚Äúdrawn‚Äù for real projects and reality (based on the experience of the machine gunner) , which was far and wide investigated and only then was presented to the public.  This factor has played an unimportant role in the past 2015 year.  At the end of 2014, we were approached by a company - a system integrator, which develops projects for the automated control system and automatic process control system for the oil industry and gas.  They began to be pressed very hard by the program of import substitution and the question of hardware and software arose before them.  They had a serious competition in hardware and software.  I must say that when we talked with their engineers on our training courses, they told us that the choice was already among the FIFTEEN of our domestic systems, but according to the results of the selection, only three of our brands "went to the hearing" and we reached the final with we are a good margin.  I would never have thought that we have such a choice of solutions, which is measured in dozens!  Their engineers came to me in December 2014 and asked them to just show the system, you can even on Skype, which I did ... In an hour or two of this presentation, I only heard a uniform sniff, and at the end, when I asked if there were any questions, I only received One answer: they like everything, they wanted to make sure that it really is as they understood it, and this is how I showed it to them. <br>  We must pay tribute to the leadership of this company - when they arrived at the talks and we asked them a question: how did you like the system and in general, what did you like about it so much?  The management answered clearly: we are not aware of the technical details, the system was chosen by our engineers - after all, they should work with it and achieve the goals we set for them.  Now we have come to discuss only legal issues and plans for cooperation.  Pancake!  I was ready to jump up from my seat and shake hands with each of them for such words!  It was a beautiful management decision that I remembered forever.  And it justified itself in consequence!  The only time I saw was the LITERARY MANAGEMENT decision. <br>  After all the formalities they sent us engineers for training.  A program was developed and the course was successfully conducted.  It was at the end of January, right after the New Year holidays of 2015.  And in mid-February, we received news from the company that they successfully participated in the city of Tomsk at the exhibition, where they showed their hardware and software solutions based on our platform, which were successfully demonstrated even to Miller himself. <br>  Spring was held in close cooperation with our new partner - they transferred their decisions from the American to ours, and we finished and finished with the roughness of the file, which gave unpleasant touch when stroking with the ‚Äúobject with a loving hand‚Äù.  Along the way, we had new customers who offered to try the system on their solutions, someone even decided to make a replicable solution on the basis of our product, which are now gradually coming out on stream, and we try to use this experience to improve scuds. <br>  As a result, in the summer of 2015, our first system integrator successfully commissioned its system at PJSC Gazprom, having carried out a serious commission for its acceptance, as a result of which only two wishes were given out to the board itself!  It is the wishes, not comments!  It was cool!  It's really really cool, to realize that what you have invented and created is WORKING!  And it does not just work - others started working on it and they like the system!  The integrator company has now completely switched over to our decision and it justifies itself! <br>  With one of the companies we are now making a replicable solution for automated cargo handling in warehouses and for transport and courier companies - many new topics and works: video processing, interaction with external ERP on SAP and 1C, protocol interactions with equipment from different manufacturers. <br>  Literally now, I digress a little from the current project - the ASTUE system (technical accounting of electrical energy) for one large oil company.  The uniqueness lies in the fact that we are doing the whole NDP of the system remotely, without going to the object itself, but through secure Internet channels.  It is also an interesting experience with the system, when there are practically no hands on the object, and when you do everything remotely only through a PC monitor. <br>  The other day, I was approached by my old acquaintances - they open a training center for the training of specialists and automation engineers.  On the basis of this center, they want to make a separate training course for specialists in my field.  It is a certified center.  Frames - they decide everything, it is the right statement!  We will fully help them in this. <br>  Well, and lastly, from the experience that can affect your future (some lyrics and an example): I am from the time when I was taught at school and the institute not to cram, but to understand the essence of the problem, to find the material correctly and master the material so that it can be applied to solve this problem!  In this I consider the ‚ÄúSoviet school‚Äù model to be the ideal form of training ... I myself understand that I can do a lot just by starting to study the necessary material, which I myself can choose and master.  This greatly helps in growth.  Intellectual of course.  We are our own creators!  A diamond, when acquiring a facet, is much more expensive, just as a specialist ‚Äî gaining experience and knowledge, is like a diamond!  Why I, recently, in my experience of development and the results achieved - I received an interesting proposal to participate in one of the projects as an architect of a large system, the proposal is still being worked out, but does not exclude my complete removal from my project.  This is a real life example - no one would follow my progress or experience, let alone make offers, I would sit at the PC for home and take my juice in games, chats and other social games ... By the way, I was at meetings of many "Players of the industrial control system, almost everyone said that they" watched with interest, "and someone from the West, shaking hands, said:" I am glad to meet a future competitor. "  Moreover, one can immediately see those who are ‚Äúin the subject line‚Äù and follow the market trends, and as it turned out, it is the well-known brands that are watching, and even large companies-players try to ignore, well, or pretend. <br>  We are the rulers of our time, and we decide on what to spend, and what we want to receive in return!  Do not waste it on bullshit !!!  Form yourself - improve and do not be afraid to raise the intellectual weight more than your expectations, as practice shows - unlike the barbell we can lift it if we want! <br>  PS Last year I became a dad!  The care has increased, but they are all pleasant, and as my project - FAVORITE!  Moreover, it was my project that allowed me to organize childbirth and take part in them, in connection with which I received a huge stream of impressions and understandings of my wife!  At one time, when I sat for almost a year in the kitchen with a PC until 3 am and wrote a scud, she went to meet me and understood me.  For which I am infinitely grateful to her! </div>
