      Even intended to be public, the discussion of the draft standard NB-Fi in Technical Committee 194 of Rosstandard in fact from the public turned out to be completely closed. <br><br>  We would like to correct this situation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8y/3m/2b/8y3m2b129ezaqpbzk7r12xfkuh4.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>So, at <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019">InoThings ++ 2019</a> (Moscow, April 4) the first real public discussion of the topic of national standards, state regulation and state support in the field of the Internet of Things will be held, in which we will try to present all possible points of view from the speakers, and give the listeners an opportunity to ask their questions.</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Here, of course, it is necessary to make a reservation - direct publicity is limited to conference visitors and spectators of the live broadcast;  but this is a natural consequence of the very nature of our event - alas, we have tickets to buy. <br><br>  We do not impose any other restrictions on the nature of the discussion. <br><br>  Direct participants in the discussion: <br><br><ul><li>  Andrey <b>Azhigirov</b> - Deputy General Director for Business Development, <a href="https://www.mtt.ru/ru/">MTT</a> Company </li><li>  Andrei <b>Kochkin</b> - Senior Expert on <a href="http://www.megafon.ru/">Megaphone</a> Radio Access Networks </li><li>  Oleg <b>Plotnikov</b> - Director of <a href="https://www.is74.ru/">Intersvyaz</a> Industrial Internet Center </li><li>  Andrei <b>Bakumenko</b> - Deputy General Director of the <a href="https://waviot.ru/">Telematic Solutions</a> Company, better known as Vaviot </li><li>  Alexander <b>Sheptovetsky</b> - Technical Director of the company ‚Äú <a href="https://goodwan.com/">GoodWAN</a> ‚Äù (many also know Alexander as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of <a href="http://altonika.ru/">Altonika</a> ) </li><li>  Andrei <b>Tsislav</b> - technical director of the company " <a href="https://strij.tech/">Modern Radio Technologies</a> ", better known as "Swift" </li><li>  Danila <b>Nikolaev</b> - Executive Secretary of the Technical Committee of Rosstandart 194 " <a href="http://tc194.ru/">Cyber-physical systems</a> " (TK194) </li><li>  Dmitry <b>Lakontsev</b> - Head of the Center for Competence of the Scientific and Technical Institution ‚Äú <a href="https://iot.skoltech.ru/">Wireless Communication Technologies and the Internet of Things</a> ‚Äù at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology </li><li>  Victor <b>Ratnikov</b> - Vice-President for Innovation B2B and IoT of <a href="https://ertelecom.ru/t/ru/">ER-Telecom Holding</a> </li><li>  Timofey <b>Shevyakov</b> - advisor on work with government agencies of the company " <a href="https://ru.wargaming.net/">Wargaming</a> " </li><li>  Ruslan <b>Kirichek</b> - Doctor of Technical Sciences, Associate Professor, Deputy Head of the Department of Communication and Data Transmission Networks, <a href="http://www.seti.sut.ru/">St. Petersburg State University of Telecommunications</a> ( <a href="http://www.seti.sut.ru/">Saint-Petersburg State University of</a> Sport and Technology Bonch-Bruevich) </li></ul><br>  Leading <del>  ceremonies </del>  round table - Evgeny <b>Grin</b> , representative of <a href="https://www.actility.com/">Actility</a> in Russia, the CIS and the Baltic States. <br><br>  As you can see, we have tried to collect all possible points of view - regardless of whether these points of view coincide with ours or not.  Our task is to help the entire Russian IoT market to understand what is happening, and this will become possible no sooner than we hear in a relaxed atmosphere all the interested parties ready for meaningful dialogue. <br><br>  Of course, such a scale of discussion requires us to have non-standard timing - and it will be: we allocate two full hours to the round table, plus a half-hour margin just in case. <br><br>  This will not be a statement ‚Äúinto the air‚Äù of the opinions of each of those present - most of the round table will be held in the format of discussion, moreover, we will give an opportunity to all listeners to ask their questions from the audience. <br><br>  Yes, this is a rather unprecedented format for technology conferences - however, the InoThings ++ program committee unanimously concluded that such a public discussion is vital for the entire industry. <br><br>  We invite all visitors of InoThings ++ 2019 to join the audience of the round table, ask questions to those present, write their impressions and comments on Habr√©, professional forums and social networks. <br><br>  You can discuss what is happening, in addition to Habr, in the <a href="https://t.me/InoThingsTalks">Telegram channel of our conference</a> . <br><br>  If you are a media representative and want to receive accreditation for the event, write to me at oleg@unwds.com or in WhatsApp / Telegram at +7 916 631-34-90. <br><br><h4>  InoThings ++ Program Committee </h4><br>  Such a serious topic requires a presentation, so we will introduce ourselves.  The InoThings ++ 2019 Program Committee is: <br><br><ul><li>  Oleg Artamonov - the chairman of the program committee, the general director of the company ‚Äú <a href="https://www.unwireddevices.com/">Unwired Devices</a> ‚Äù, that is, I </li><li>  Evgeny Grin - representative of <a href="https://www.actility.com/">Actility</a> in Russia, the CIS and the Baltic States </li><li>  Mikhail Glukhovchenko - Systems Analyst, <a href="https://www.sierrawireless.com/">Sierra Wireless</a> </li></ul><br>  The InoThings ++ program committee works within the framework of regulations and rules common to all the ‚Äú <a href="http://ontico.ru/">Oleg Bunin Conferences</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  InoThings ++ - what is it all about? </h4><br>  InoThings ++ is one of the largest Russian conferences for professionals of the Russian IoT market, be it developers, system integrators, or end customers.  This is not a vanity fair - all reports and all participants of the round tables are moderated in the Program Committee to allow only those who can tell the professional audience really necessary and really useful things to speak. <br><br>  At <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019">InoThings ++ 2019,</a> we expect several round tables and meetings with representatives of various companies, as well as about 20 reports on topics: <br><br><ul><li>  embedded software development, including the creation of a reliable code </li><li>  security issues IoT solutions </li><li>  the development of "hardware" in specific for IoT-device framework </li><li>  legal issues of operating IoT solutions </li><li>  practical experience in implementing large IoT projects </li><li>  and much more </li></ul><br>  A preliminary list of reports can be found <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019/abstracts">at the link</a> . <br><br>  In addition to the round table, which is dedicated to this post, we plan to hold a few more discussions: <br><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúThe paradigm shift is the unsuitability of the classic telecom approach to IoT projects‚Äù with the participation of the representatives of the companies ‚ÄúGeyser Telecom‚Äù, ‚ÄúSibintek‚Äù, ‚ÄúConcern Goodwin‚Äù and others </li><li>  ‚ÄúDomestic microelectronics - state and prospects‚Äù with the participation of developers of domestic processors, such as ‚ÄúBaikal Electronics‚Äù </li><li>  "Prototyping in IoT - ready-made modules or development from scratch?" - about the eternal confrontation between "arduinschikov" and "hardcore" </li></ul><br>  The composition of these round tables at the moment is not fully formed, so if you see yourself and your company in the list of their participants - write me in the mail or in messengers.  For example, for the last round table, we are very interested in examples of system integrators who have built up a prototyping laboratory on the basis of ready-made modules and debugging boards, and due to this they are able to estimate the technological possibility of project implementation without involving third-party developers in the first stage - I absolutely know that there are such, and we want to hear them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442480/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442480/</a></p>
