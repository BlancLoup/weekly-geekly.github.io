  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Infrastructure for SAP applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The introduction of SAP systems allows the company to achieve greater transparency and manageability of business processes, process information faster and more quickly make management decisions.  But the process of SAP implementation is often quite difficult - it affects the limitations of IT budgets, and not always a sufficient level of training for IT staff.  In such conditions, integrated infrastructure solutions optimized for working with SAP applications become a good way out.  One example of such a solution is Fujitsu FlexFrame for SAP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e7/638/468/9e7638468500dba7f317e11b63f0d9df.jpg"><br>  FlexFrame for SAP is a complete infrastructure solution, all components of which - SAP applications, operating system, network infrastructure, servers, virtual machines, storage systems - are closely integrated and are under single management.  Virtualization is used as one of the tools to create a flexible, reliable and easy-to-operate IT infrastructure.  The core of FlexFrame for SAP is the SAP Adaptive Computing application virtualization technology.  Hardware virtualization is also possible: along with the physical servers in FlexFrame for SAP, you can use VMware virtual machines. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The main characteristics of the solution are flexibility, ease of resource management, ensuring fault tolerance and high availability of applications, an optimized solution lifecycle management process (from design through commissioning to support).  The advantage of FlexFrame for SAP is that the software included in the solution "knows" what the SAP system is and how to work with it.  For example, in what sequence the instances forming the SAP system should start and stop.  When administering the complex, the principle of end-to-end management is used - from the SAP system to the infrastructure, and most of the operations are performed automatically.  For example, when adding a new SAP system to a complex, it is enough to indicate its name (SID), numbers and types of instances.  Everything else, including the allocation of IP addresses, the creation of users, file systems, the inclusion of high availability in the contour, will be done automatically.  It is also important that high availability for SAP applications is provided out of the box, without the need to purchase and further customize the software.

      To reduce the amount of work, risks and costs associated with the implementation of FlexFrame for SAP, Fujitsu developed a special technique that is constantly being improved based on the experience and feedback from customers.  With the help of the special FlexFrame Planning Tool a complete specification of the solution (up to IP addresses) is compiled and a complete set of installation documentation is prepared.  For each customer, the solution is pre-assembled, individually configured at the Fujitsu factory and delivered in a ready-to-use form.  Due to this, the time taken to put the solution into operation is drastically reduced: from the moment the boxes are opened until the complex is ready for operation, it usually takes only two or three days.  From the point of view of SAP applications, FlexFrame for SAP provides a standard operating environment, so the installation or migration of SAP systems does not cause any difficulties for SAP consultants. <br><br>  Recently, there has been a steady increase in interest in the FlexFrame for SAP solution from customers who need a comprehensive solution that ensures the creation of a high-performance and efficient IT infrastructure for SAP systems.  Increasing IT infrastructure flexibility and reliability, simplifying operation and reducing the impact of the human factor, reducing the total cost of ownership of IT infrastructure (both in money and labor costs) are the tasks that FlexFrame for SAP successfully solves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c8a/d63/725/c8ad637253637bbae17d0b4f0f459661.jpg"><br><br>  FlexFrame is not the only Fijitsu solution for SAP.  Fujitsu's portfolio of integrated solutions for developing and supporting the SAP landscape includes systems such as Business Warehouse Accelerator Infrastructure, which provides large database and enterprise storage analysis with high speed and flexibility, and an optimized infrastructure to take advantage of in-memory computing - Fujitsu Power Appliance for SAP HANA.  Fujitsu‚Äôs SAP IT infrastructure, including support and maintenance services, including IT infrastructure hosting, both at the enterprise and in Fijitsu data processing centers, as well as a number of other SAP infrastructure services are also available to customers. <br><br>  <i>PS: If you have questions on SAP that you wanted, but were too shy to ask, write in the comments.</i>  <i>Explain and tell)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168351/</a></p>
