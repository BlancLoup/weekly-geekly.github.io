This is more concerned not with stand-alone blogs, but with blogger communities like LJ, my own circle, LI, etc. <br><br>  Why razvodilovo for advertisers? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will note right away that the conversation is about adsense and other pay-per-click systems, since  media advertising to this defect is subject to much less.  Because blogging communities are the perfect click clubs.  I will click on my friends' blogs on advertising, I have them, and so it‚Äôs easy to provide a CTR of at least 10% and at least $ 50 in earnings a day.  The bloggers are happy, the advertising network is happy.  Only advertisers can be dissatisfied, but most are simply unaware that this is the case, and very few people can properly control exactly where its advertising is displayed. <br><br>  Now this easy money is complicated by the fact that each participant requires a sufficiently noticeable effort to enter the system.  Those.  at a minimum, he needs to register himself in the advertising network.  But conversations around the monetization lead it in the quite expected direction, where blog hosting is becoming an advertising aggregator of its users and acting as a commercial agency for them.  After that, it becomes elementary to include all your friends in the click club.  Habr is moving in this direction, and it seems that Moykrug is going there too.

      Stand-alone bloggers have already fully mastered this technology.  As it should be, first American, then ours.  And there, and we have it has a nice appearance.  There are more cynical calls "if you liked the material, click on our sponsors," we have a benevolent donation, "read your text, liked it, clicked on advertising."  I didn‚Äôt see click clubs in its purest form, and even didn‚Äôt even hear it, there is just an unwritten rule of good tone ‚Äúyou to me, I tell you‚Äù, it‚Äôs like with karma on Habr√©. <br><br>  And what about Google?  Perhaps this situation will suit him completely, at least in the beginning - one must somehow successfully conquer the Russian segment. <br><br>  Why razvodilovo for bloggers? <br><br>  Because 99% of bloggers will be able to earn $ 1 per month if they write in their usual mode, and $ 2 per month if they spend 10 times more time on their blog.  Spend the time that they could spend with greater benefit for themselves, doing either something pleasant, or working even as a janitor.  But the ghost of the golden calf monetizing blogs will beckon them and make them write, write, write, read, comment, promote ... <br><br>  And as a result, the cream will remove the advertising agency and the bloghost.  Something it looks like those same gambling, where the one who wins, does it at the expense of losing others, but the main money goes to the game organizer.  Only here, instead of pure money, bloggers spend them indirectly, in the form of their time. <br><br>  Moreover, the blohohost and the advertising agency benefit most from both types of razvodilova.  Not surprisingly, they will actively promote the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmonetizing blogs to the masses, heating up their nutrient medium. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/2961/">https://habr.com/ru/post/2961/</a></p>
