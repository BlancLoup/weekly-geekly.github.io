I had the following criteria when choosing a new assistant when working: <br>  ‚Ä¢ weight up to 2 kg is my psychological mark <br>  ‚Ä¢ long battery life - no less than 6 hours, like my netbook <br>  ‚Ä¢ 13.3 "screen - I think this is the optimal size of the laptop, which I will constantly take with me <br>  ‚Ä¢ High quality performance - I want to work on it comfortably. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Price up to 25.000 rubles is another psychological mark of mine, since  pay more I did not see any sense <br>  ‚Ä¢ Less gloss - I have a cat in my house, whose wool ‚Äúhas multiplied‚Äù all over the apartment and sticks to any object <br><br>  Since March, I have already planned for myself one very good laptop - Acer Aspire Timeline 3810. In it, I saw the ideal laptop.  But, over time, something better appears.  So it happened.  In late March, I learned that Acer has updated the Timeline line.  I liked the published specifications and photos of the 3820, but there was no information about the price and release date.  I decided to wait until May - if by that time no new information about laptops appears, then I buy a 3810 model. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On Labor Day, the manna of heavenly information surfaced in my browser window: the price of a 13 ‚Äùmodel of the new TimelineX line at a price of 25 thousand rubles and the date of the announcement is already on the nose, mid-May.

But this stuff, the laptop is in my hands. <br><br><h4>  <b>Meet on clothes</b> <br></h4><br>  The laptop has a strict style, a minimum of roundness and bumps.  The back cover is made of aluminum because of what is very pleasant to the touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a5/19b/de5/6a519bde5e693ada5d4ad25310d2418d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside the gloss and stylized metal plastic.  In terms of design, the notebook causes only positive emotions, even the gloss could not be misleading in this case, and, with a weight of 1.8 kg, it causes delight. <br><br><h4>  <b>What is the casket?</b> <b><br></b> </h4><br>  My Acer Aspire TimelineX 3820TG-333G25i model has a new generation Intel Core i3 2.13 GHz mobile processor onboard, Intel GMA 4500HD integrated graphics, an ATI Mobility Radeon 5470 512 MB graphics card, 3 GB DDR3 1066 MHz RAM and a 250 GB hard drive .  From interfaces: 3 usb 2.0, D-SUB, HDMI, audio ports for headphones and a microphone, a network connector for RJ-45. <br><br>  Not bad, huh? <br><br>  This is what 3DMark06 showed on both video cards. <br><br>  Intel <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/137/33b/f0b/13733bf0b64f1805db7db9fdeacce555.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ATI <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/572/83e/0f3/57283e0f311a583301bbf31e47ffd2c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Almost a fourfold advantage behind the decision from ATI and there is nothing surprising. <br><br>  And it's a sin not to show the Windows system rating. <br><br>  Intel <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d2/f9d/fae/2d2f9dfaed3b86ab083fd28cfff95b41.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ATI <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c54/961/6cf/c549616cfa4666609a83138c0ac0f456.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Intel‚Äôs integrated graphics do not play much, so it‚Äôs here for the office, for more demanding tasks: games, graphics or high-definition movies is a discrete solution from AMD. <br>  There will be enough such capacity for me and work and rest - which is good news.  Metro 2033 started without any problems and is playing quite comfortably. <br><br><h4>  <b>Light my mirror ...</b> </h4><br><br>  Glossy screen, what can I say.  That's what - glossy border of the screen in addition. <br><br>  This is perhaps the most significant minus the laptop.  In the sun you will see your reflection rather than the displayed image.  And yet the matrix itself at the laptop is very good, the judge on foreign reviews color rendition is almost at the premium level.  Viewing angles, in comparison with the previous series, have become better, but not perfect.  Fortunately, this position saves a little more angle of opening the screen than its predecessor. <br><br><h4>  <b>Buttons!</b> <b><br></b> </h4><br>  I already guessed that all the unused gloss from the keyboards of the previous Timeline series of laptops switched to the edging of the screens of the new line.  And it pleases! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/558/5d3/8d7/5585d38d70ed179a329d30de79bbe1a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After all, now it seems that the keys floating in the air are made of a rough plastic, very, very pleasant for fingers.  In the previous model, not only was the fact that due to the gloss one could easily remove fingerprints from any key, and sometimes the finger behaved as if it were drunk because of the slippery surface.  Regarding the location of the keys - the location is pretty familiar to me even in my old EeePc 1000H.  Tiny only flaw - castrated arrows. <br>  I generally like that Acer came up with something different in terms of design and ergonomic keys, and did not go, like many, for Apple and Sony. <br><br><h4>  <b>Long-playing</b> <b><br></b> </h4><br>  The manufacturer promises us 8 hours of work.  Yes it is.  At the lowest level of screen brightness, with an open office, wi-fi turned off and a minimum of programs in the tray for 8 hours, it will work, it is checked. <br>  If we want to sit on the Internet at McDonalds, and increase the brightness to 50%, then the laptop will work for 5-6 hours. <br>  We will be able to view 720p video for 3 hours, but with a brightness of the same 50%. <br>  And we can play for 1.5-2 hours in good demanding games with maximum brightness and wi-fi on. <br>  These are very good indicators, but I would like to be even better.  From the very beginning I didn‚Äôt want to take a charge with me, because  All-time I wind around Moscow and I can not recharge it.  Yes, and charging is very overall.  The output, I see the purchase of a 9-cell battery, especially since it is very compact, judging by the photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a21/40a/d24/a2140ad2441a1ff4fdb414c5c4f3f2f9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>On trifles</b> <b><br></b> </h5><br>  Quickly run through other facts about the laptop. <br>  Near hot air blowing grids over time, a wooden table heats up quite well.  If you play games, then the noise from 2x (and there are just as many) fans will be clearly heard, but not annoying. <br>  Indicators shine a bright blue color, which when working in a dark room can adversely affect vision. <br>  Included was a 64-bit Windows HP, showing everything this laptop is capable of. <br>  The case sometimes creaks. <br>  In this model, there is no bluetooth and dvd-rom. <br>  Purchase price: 24.800 - the magic price for such a handsome laptop. <br><br><h4>  <b>Pros and cons</b> <br></h4><br>  Run through the pros and cons of a laptop. <br>  Pros: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Good performance <br>  ‚Ä¢ Long battery life <br>  ‚Ä¢ Light weight for such a laptop - 1.8 kg <br>  ‚Ä¢ Good design <br>  ‚Ä¢ Pre-installed Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit with a set of useful programs from Acer <br>  ‚Ä¢ Comfortable keyboard <br>  ‚Ä¢ Low price of 25,000 rubles for such a laptop <br>  Minuses: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Glossy screen, glossy screen trim and keyboards <br>  ‚Ä¢ Heavy power unit <br>  ‚Ä¢ Bright indicators <br>  The ratio of 7 to 3, in favor of the benefits - a good result. <br><br><h4>  <b>Summarize</b> <br></h4><br>  This laptop is very appealing to those who want at the same time quite a thin, light and long-playing laptop with good performance.  Yes, there are flaws, but there are much more pluses. <br>  After a week and a half after the purchase, I do not regret that I chose this particular laptop.  My father liked TimelineX so much that he bought an older model - Acer Aspire TimelineX 4820. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94628/</a></p>
