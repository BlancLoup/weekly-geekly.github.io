  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Basic principles of game development</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article is intended for people who want to engage in (or recently engaged in) game devs, but do not have practical experience in this area.  Here I will share my own experience and tell you the most basic of different areas of game development, from interface design to monetization.  Of course, each of the topics under consideration is worthy of a separate article, and in some cases it is a whole science, according to which books are written, and it is impossible to fully disclose them within one article.  I‚Äôll just focus on the main points, give a few examples to give you a starting point for your work, focus your attention on the important nuances to save your time.  So let's get started. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  A little bit about yourself </h5><br>  In order for you to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat experience I am going to share, I will briefly tell you what I did.  I participated in the creation of 6 small projects for social networks and mobile platforms, some of which can be found in the tops.  He worked in two studios of up to 30 people, plus was engaged in his own developments.  By education I am a programmer.  In addition to writing application code, I actively participated in the development of interfaces, game design and monetization of projects. <br><br><h5>  What is a computer game? </h5><br>  Of course, everyone can somehow answer this question.  But let's talk about the game, as a complex, multifaceted product.  After all, if a person wants to create something, he needs to clearly understand what it is.  To understand this, let's dive into the history of the development of passive entertainment. <br><br>  Perhaps the very first and most famous passive way of spending leisure time was reading fiction, which originated over the millennia BC.  Books can tell us many interesting stories that come to life in our imagination.

      <br>
      At the end of the XIX century began the history of cinema.  Cinema, as we know it today, not only tells the story, but also shows it, allowing the viewer to see the story with his own eyes as if he had been walking near the hero all this time. <br>  And finally, in the 50s-60s of the XX century, the first computer games began to appear.  Unlike the movie, the game can not only show and tell a story: here you are in the main roles.  You are a hero who has gone through all the trials. <br>  So, a modern computer game = plot + picture + gameplay.  These are three equal parts that should be worked on equally.  Otherwise, you risk getting 2/3 of the game or even 1/3.  Profit accordingly. <br><br><h6>  Plot </h6><br>  Let's agree at once that the word ‚Äúplot‚Äù in the context of a computer game will mean 3 components: <br><br>  1) The scenario is a chain of events on which the story is based. <br><br>  2) The atmosphere is what surrounds the story being told.  Here and side-quests, showing the events in a different light, and the soundtrack, and art design, and many little things that emphasize the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game. <br><br>  3) Staging.  Here is how the story is told and shown.  Directing, story-telling, etc. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe plot is for large projects and indie games.  This is not about our venture. ‚Äù  A few years ago I would agree with this statement, but not today.  Once upon a time, when new genres were invented every year, when each game introduced something new into its genre, the player could easily be carried away by the gameplay for hours.  But today this is no longer the case: all genres have been mastered, and to come up with something fundamentally new is already the exception rather than part of the rule.  In order for a person to do something with interest for a long time, the object of his activity must be dynamic, changing.  And since all the key features of all genres by players have long and thoroughly studied, it is almost impossible to maintain the dynamics of the game at the expense of the gameplay.  And here you have only 1 way out: the plot.  This also applies to online games.  However, when developing the storyline for your game, remember the parable about the overflowing glass of water: an excess of dynamism is as bad as its lack.  Alternate segments of the game, filled with plot scenes with segments filled with gameplay ideas: wrapped up a heartbreaking drama?  Jest and give a couple of thousands of zombies.  Smoke mouse / gamepad?  Give a walk through your wonderfully crafted world. <br>  ‚ÄúBut the bulk of my target audience hates reading dialogs longer than five words!‚Äù Yes, that's right.  And this must be remembered.  In no case do not get carried away with long texts, even if your game is voiced by actors.  Remember: a single action, an event or some kind of picture on the fence can tell the player about your world much more than a ten-minute dialogue, which will be viewed by 7.42% of your target audience.  Than telling the minor hero with words about why and how much he dislikes goblins, better give him a bonus of 0.003% to damage against them, and begin to get to know him from the scene of exterminating these poor fellows. <br><br><h6>  Picture + Sound </h6><br>  Also, we will immediately agree: picture = graphics + location design. <br>  The picture should be "on the level."  See what other games look like on the platform for which you are creating a game, and make ‚Äúno worse‚Äù.  There are plenty of examples of how in the weather for technology, developers have forgotten to make the game itself.  In the end - dismal sales statistics.  One first crysis is worth something. <br>  Remember that not only the detail, HD-textures and delights of modern shaders are important, but also the design of locations.  Technology should emphasize the beauty of your design, and not create it. <br>  The sound, in turn, not only fills your game with life, emphasizing the atmosphere: it can be part of the gameplay.  For example, in the Silent Hill game, the screech from a non-working radio, which the main character always carried with him, foreshadowed the appearance of enemies.  The player has not seen yet does not see the enemy, but already knows that he is near.  Having betrayed the meaning to some sounds, you will force the player to perceive the information not only visually, but also by hearing.  This will draw off some of his attention, and not only give him new and more complete gaming experiences, but also reduce the likelihood of concentrating his attention on the possible shortcomings of your game. <br><br><h6>  Gameplay </h6><br>  As mentioned above, the game can not only show and tell a story: here you are in the main roles.  You are a hero who has gone through all the trials.  Use it!  Remember that when playing a game, the player makes an effort.  As a result, he is not indifferent to the fate of his character.  Make him make decisions, and let him face their consequences.  I'm not talking about the plot, but about the gameplay: the choice of a particular branch of development will make something inaccessible, but it will pay off in something else.  I mean not just some skills, but also, perhaps, whole locations, or even quests. <br>  Always remember what kind of game you are doing, and for whom (who is the target audience).  Do not incorporate ideas into the project that are at odds with the plot, the setting, or anything else.  The same applies to the other components of the game: If you can make a beautiful explosion quickly = desh, this does not mean at all that the gardening project needs it.  Of course, this example is very obvious, but you may encounter not such obvious moments, which nonetheless deprive your game of harmony.  Be careful. <br><br><h5>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game is not the main thing. </h5><br>  ‚ÄúWhy do people have to choose your game among all modern diversity?‚Äù Is the first important question to ask yourself.  Everybody asks himself in one form or another, and many respond to it with dignity by inventing and adequately implementing a great idea.  Well, you advertised your idea, and people chose your game.  ‚ÄúWhy should they continue to play it, bringing you a profit?‚Äù Is the second important question you should ask yourself.  Figuratively speaking, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game is the trunk of the tree, and everything else is all sorts of details, art design, soundtrack, everything that surrounds your idea is crown.  The trunk of a tree can be mighty and strong.  But without a crown, the tree looks empty and lifeless. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/83f/84a/997/83f84a997c90d978deb9e72ba04ab649.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Speaking of the same from a different point of view, we can say: ‚ÄúEveryone has an idea.  Where it is more important to know how to implement it. "  And it is the process of implementing your idea - creating the crown of your tree harbors a lot of pitfalls that are not visible until the first time you come across them: <br><br>  How to arrange buttons and interface panels? <br>  How to align the balance? <br>  Why no one buys in-game gaming currency? <br>  Why such low marks?  After all, we have such a great game! <br><br>  And so on and so forth‚Ä¶ <br><br><h5>  The game from the player's point of view </h5><br>  Ask yourself the question ‚Äúhow our project looks from the players point of view‚Äù more often.  Remember that working on the game, investing in it your strength, you lose the opportunity to objectively evaluate your product.  When you come to play your game, the first thing that people see is download speed, picture quality, and, most importantly, usability, gameplay management.  Only then, perhaps, the player will be able to appreciate all the delights of your project. <br><br>  Do not underestimate the load time.  This is especially critical for small projects for mobile platforms: here, according to statistics, you risk losing the lion‚Äôs share of players just because your game will load for more than 20 seconds (I could be wrong with the numbers, but the essence is the same). <br><br>  If you have to choose between expanding the diversity of gameplay and improving management responsiveness, correcting minor, non-critical management flaws or something else that affects the friendliness of the gameplay, feel free to choose the second: as mentioned above, the player will have to cope with the management and understand, as they say, with the basics of your game. <br><br>  Do not overdo it with death penalties, equipment breakdowns, etc.  The player must be able to avoid any ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù: he must go all risks consciously and independently: drop gear at death?  Only in special places (a special level of difficulty in insta) or under special conditions (unleashing PC battles).  Any deprivation, be it loss of experience, or deprivation of equipment, for reasons beyond the control of the player (killing by a stronger player in the open field, dying on ordinary locations, especially as a result of a disconnect) causes negative emotions that weaken interest in the game.  While failures with conscious risk may have the opposite effect. <br><br>  Small, annoying flaws can lead to the fact that players, without understanding your game, will begin to give her low marks.  And it is doubly insulting that this is not because the game is bad, but because people simply could not appreciate it. <br><br><h5>  Social component. </h5><br>  Ratings, all kinds of functions ‚Äúpoint a friend‚Äù, cooperative modes, etc.  For small projects, there is no need to reinvent the bicycle, but you should not neglect this: any form of social interaction is welcome.  These are a few more reasons to play your game longer.  Social functions in games are becoming increasingly popular. <br><br><h5>  Monetization </h5><br>  It is no secret that the most effective distribution model is F2P (free to play).  About her and talk. <br>  The worst thing you can do is think "how to tear off more money from the players."  Such a desire leads to an unbalanced donat, which destroys the economy of the game, and as a result, a decline in the popularity of the game and, accordingly, a decrease in the solvent audience.  In addition, many decisions made under such a policy are ineffective. <br><br>  To effectively use this distribution model, let us see how it works.  With this distribution model, the game can be played for free, as many as you like, by anyone.  And here lies the second big mistake that is sometimes made: they make the free game unbearable, forcing the player to pay.  However, the majority either will not pay or leave the project altogether.  And some will whine on the forum, downgrading your game in the eyes of others, including potential players.  And it's very bad.  ‚ÄúSo how to be?  Let them play?  Then no one will pay! ‚Äù.  The trick is to make nonpaying audiences work for you, and for those who pay, to provide the most comfortable existence (just remember that the value of the game character still depends on the labor invested in it, and the more the player will appreciate the character, the longer he will play your game).  How to do this further: <br><br>  Conveniently focus your attention on the players who will pay.  Make a pleasant game for them.  Level the balance of experience, money, etc.  for them.  And when this is done, think about how to wrap yourself for the benefit of the work of players who do not want to pay.  Namely: try to make it so that they have to play as much as possible in order to achieve the same heights that the paying player reaches: reduce the amount of experience and money that he gets.  Reduce his inventory so that he has to walk more often and deliver the loot to the store and to the warehouse.  Slow down its speed.  Make walking instances more often.  In this case, it is possible to clearly indicate the maximum growth per day / week.  This will stretch the time spent online non-paying, thus they can always make the company paying, making their game more comfortable. <br><br>  Next, make a kind of "designer" of paid options: do you want more experience?  300r / month  Want a quick ride?  + 300r / month.  Want some big bags?  + 150r / month.  Warehouses?  150 more. And so on. <br><br>  A separate category should be mentioned customization (individualization) of the character: all kinds of dresses, the appearance of the castle on the map, the wallpaper in the room - anything, but always so that other players can see it (and not just bought). <br>  And finally, in every game there are people who have nowhere to put money.  Their fantasy is not worth limiting, but the prices here should be fabulous.  And be careful with the balance and economy.  Buying game currency - yes: they will not buy something for it that other players do not have.  Buying a top gear and / or available only for real improvement - with great caution.  Although I am not a supporter of such measures, but many games meil.ru live with this, and do not complain about life. <br><br><h5>  Interface </h5><br>  In large companies, specially trained people are involved in the development of the user interface.  That is, to make interfaces for the released software products is a separate position, and this is not casual.  An intuitive user interface is an entire science.  And if you can not afford to hire a specialist in this area - do not reinvent the wheel, but be careful when you borrow the principle of building windows, buttons, etc.  in some kind of application.  I have seen how the interface, designed for a very successful game from the top of the tablet, was pulled to the browser game.  About why this is bad, and how to be, further: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/21f/315/53e/21f31553ea56a011234896059ee9b331.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is clear that the interface should be user-friendly and intuitive.  The user should not think, look for something, and even more so, be forced to memorize where such a function is located there.  But what is convenient on the tablet is completely unsuitable for a PC.  The principle of building the interface should come from the manipulator with which the control takes place: in the case of the tablet, these are our hands.  On a PC, this is a mouse and keyboard.  On the console - a gamepad.  Each of these controls requires an individual interface design.  Moreover, you need to take into account the genre of your game.  The screen should only be what the player absolutely needs.  What may be needed at any time should be called up in one click, etc.  For example: <br><br>  In the case of a tablet, when a player needs to hit the button with his finger, everything clickable must be impressive in size in order to minimize the chance that in the heat of battle the player will miss the button he needs and thereby receive a negative impression.  In turn, such large buttons will look completely ridiculous on a PC or console.  On the PC, in turn, the bulk of the information is located at the bottom of the screen, because  The player's eyes are most often located above the center of the screen, and it is more convenient for him to look at its upper half, where the main action of the game is located.  However, on tablets, by clicking on interactive objects in the center of the screen, the player will overlap half of the interface, and to see how much it costs to build, how much health the character has, how much this or that building costs, etc., constantly have to remove your hand away from the screen, and again to return it to click somewhere. <br><br>  There are many more similar examples, and there will be few articles for this.  It is important to understand the essence: the interface is a barrier for the player on the way to realizing what a wonderful game you have.  And the less this barrier will be - the more chances you have to earn on the project. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Everything written above is not the ultimate truth, but my personal experience.  If someone has more experience and wants to point out errors, I will be glad to see your comments on this. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, long live play. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188372/</a></p>
