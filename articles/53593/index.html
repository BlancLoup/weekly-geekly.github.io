      <em>ADPCM</em> - Adaptive Delta Pulse Code Modulation - Adaptive Pulse Code Modulation.  The method of digital signal coding by recording the increment of amplitude values. <br><br>  B <br><br>  <em>Bitrate</em> - the number of bits used to store one second of audio in a data stream.  The term is more commonly applied to coded audio data. <br><br>  C <br><br>  <em>Channel</em> - see channel. <br><br>  <em>Chorus</em> - from eng.  ‚ÄúChorus‚Äù, the sound effect, so called because as a result of its use, the sound of the original signal turns into a sound like a chorus, that is, it ‚Äúmultiplies‚Äù.  In the general case, the effect is achieved by imposing on the signal several copies of it that are shifted in time. <br><br>  <em>Codec - COder / DECoder</em> - Encoder / Decoder.  Software or hardware unit designed to encode / decode data. <br><br>  <em>ontinuous spectrum</em> - see continuous spectrum. <br><br>  <em>Continuous noise</em> - see continuous noise. <br><br>  <em>Compressor</em> - see compressor. <br><br>  <em>Covox</em> is a small device that connects to a parallel port of a computer and is designed to play sound through an amplifier or headphones. <br><br>  <em>Cycle</em> - see cycle. <br><br>  D <br><br>  <em>Dithering</em> - Artificial mixing of pseudo-random white noise to an audio signal, resulting in the dispersion of quantization noise across the signal spectrum. <br><br>  <em>Distortion</em> - (‚Äúdistortion‚Äù, English), the effect of sounding, based on the use of amplitude modulation.  In fact, it is the replacement of some values ‚Äã‚Äãof the signal amplitudes by other values.  Due to over-force when cutting the tops of the input signal, you can get, for example, the classic version of the heavy metal guitar (that is, the signal is given a grinding sound or a kind of "hoarseness").  The use of this effect leads to a rather sharp distortion of the input signal (depending on the modulation depth), as a result of which the signal becomes similar to a square wave, and as a result, the signal spectrum expands.  The classic mechanism for obtaining the effect is as follows: the input signal is mixed with its copy, subjected to conversion in an amplitude modulation block, which has two signal levels: threshold and upper.  If the amplitude of the signal entering the block does not exceed the threshold level, then the signal passes to the block output unchanged.  If the signal amplitude is above the threshold level, then the block amplifies such a signal to the upper level. <br><br>  <em>DMA</em> - Direct Memory Access.

MIDI standard developed by Yamaha. <br><br><h3>  Russian language. </h3><br>  BUT <br><br>  <em>Absolute signal coding</em> - the representation of a signal in the form of numerical values ‚Äã‚Äãof its amplitude, taken with a specific frequency. <br><br>  <em>Acoustics</em> - general and theoretical acoustics are concerned with studying the laws of radiation and the propagation of elastic waves in various media, as well as their interaction with the environment.  The acoustics sections include electroacoustics, architectural acoustics and building acoustics, atmospheric acoustics, geoacoustics, hydroacoustics, physics and ultrasound technology, psychological and physiological acoustics, and musical acoustics. <br><br>  <em>Acoustic wave</em> - see sound wave. <br><br>  <em>The acoustic spectrum of sound</em> is a combination of sinusoidal components of complex sound, given by the amplitudes and frequencies of these components. <br><br>  <em>Amplitude</em> is the largest deviation of a quantity fluctuating according to a certain law from an average value or from a certain value conventionally taken as zero;  value of the signal at a given time. <br><br>  <em>The amplitude envelope of the spectrum</em> is a curve connecting the amplitudes of the spectral components on the graph. <br><br>  <em>AOIKM</em> - Adaptive Relative Pulse Code Modulation.  See ADPCM. <br><br>  <em>Arrangement</em> - the arrangement of a musical work for performance on another instrument or other voice, other composition of instruments or voices;  facilitated presentation of a musical work for performance on the same instrument;  harmonization and instrumentation of a new or well-known melody. <br><br>  B <br><br>  <em>Balance</em> - the ratio of the levels of signals in the channels. <br><br>  <em>Beats</em> - occur when two sinusoidal oscillations are applied with similar frequencies.  They are periodic.  The basic beat frequency in this case is equal to the difference between the frequencies of superimposed interacting sinusoidal oscillations. <br><br>  <em>The binary representation of a number</em> is the representation of a number in binary number system, that is, in the form of zeros and ones. <br><br>  <em>Binaural recording</em> is a two-channel (stereo) audio recording designed for playback through headphones (the signal of each channel is sent to the corresponding ear).  In this way, the perception of sound sources in their original position in space is achieved. <br><br>  <em>Binaural effect</em> - the ability of man and higher animals to determine the direction to the sound source.  Due to the fact that the ears are located at a certain distance, the sound comes to them, differing in phase and intensity, which leads to the difference of impulses entering the central nervous system from the right and left ear, and makes it possible to determine the direction. <br><br>  <em>Bit-stream</em> - see digital stream. <br><br>  <em>Bitrate</em> - see bitrate <br><br>  <em>Biphonic processor</em> - a device that allows you to get a binaural effect when listening to binaural recording through speakers. <br><br>  <em>Household noise</em> - the sound of an arbitrary nature, undesirable in these conditions or for a given person. <br><br>  AT <br><br>  <em>A wave</em> is a spatial and temporal change in the state of the environment, which can be represented as its unidirectional movement.  There are transverse and longitudinal waves. <br><br>  <em>Wave table</em> - usually - MIDI-synthesizer, based on the use of table-wave synthesis. <br><br>  <em>The reverberation</em> time is the time from the moment the sound source is turned off until the acoustic energy density or sound intensity decreases to the acoustic energy density or sound intensity decreases to one millionth of its original value, i.e.  up to 60 dB (standard DIN 52212). <br><br>  <em>The pitch of the sound</em> depends not only on the frequency of the main tone, but also on a number of additional factors, such as loudness, duration and spectral composition of the sound.  The pitch of a complex signal is determined by the lowest (main) frequency, either present in the signal itself, or due to the shape of its envelope curve. <br><br>  R <br><br>  <em>Harmonica</em> is the simplest periodic function that characterizes harmonic oscillation, which is a component of a complex oscillation, with a frequency that is a multiple of the fundamental frequency (first harmonic).  In acoustics and music, harmonics are called overtones. <br><br>  D <br><br>  <em>Sound pressure</em> - characterizes the magnitude of the physical pressure of the sound wave.  It is convenient to measure the absolute sound pressure in dB since, for example, the quietest sound distinguished by the human ear corresponds to a pressure of 20 * 10-6 Pa, the loudest sound is 200000000 * 10-6 Pa.  If you compare these values ‚Äã‚Äãsimply by finding their ratio, it will be 10,000,000: 1 Pa, which is very inconvenient.  To calculate the absolute sound pressure in dB, the following formula is used: P (dBspl) = 20 * lg (P / Pthor), where P is the sound pressure, Pa;  Pthor - threshold pressure of audibility (Pthor = 20 * 10-6 Pa);  dBspl - sound pressure level in dB, i.e.  sound pressure level in dB.  Instant sound pressure - pressure at a certain point in the medium at some point in time minus the static pressure at that point.  Peak sound pressure is the absolute maximum instant sound pressure that occurs during a certain period of time. <br><br>  <em>Decompressor</em> - see expander. <br><br>  <em>Decrement</em> is the main value when calculating attenuation.  Decrement is a characteristic of the decay rate of two oscillations following one after another in the same direction. <br><br>  <em>Decibel (dB)</em> is a relative logarithmic quantity that characterizes the ratio of two physical quantities numerically.  Usually, the amplitude of sound is measured in decibels.  6 dB difference means amplitude difference 2 times, 12 dB difference - 4 times (that is, if A1 is one amplitude and A2 is different, then the decibel difference X is calculated by the formula: X = 20 * lg (A1 / A2) when lg is the logarithm of base 10).  Either the quietest sound heard by a person, or (in digital audio) the loudest sound that does not go beyond the permissible amplitude range, is often taken as 0 dB. <br><br>  <em>Jitter</em> - see jitter. <br><br>  <em>Dithering</em> - see dithering. <br><br>  <em>Dynamic range</em> is the range of the highest and lowest signal levels.  Measured in dB.  The calculation of the dynamic range is carried out according to the following formula: D = 20 * lg (Pmax / Pmin), where Pmax and Pmin are the maximum and minimum values ‚Äã‚Äãof sound pressure, respectively.  For practical reasons, it is customary to calculate the dynamic range as the difference Pmax and Pmin.  The maximum dynamic range, for example, voices, is approximately 57 dB.  Signals that have too wide a dynamic range can cause overloads in the equipment.  This is especially true of various recording and digitizing devices. <br><br>  <em>Signal sampling (during digitization)</em> is the process of obtaining the amplitude values ‚Äã‚Äãof a digitized signal at certain time intervals (see digitizing the signal). <br><br>  <em>Distortion</em> - see distortion. <br><br>  <em>Wavelength</em> - the distance between the two nearest points of the wave that are shifted in phase by one full period. <br><br>  <em>Driver</em> - control program, i.e.  a program that calls another program (or programs) and sets its work parameters;  A program that organizes the interaction of physical devices with the BIOS and operating system. <br><br>  <em>A device driver</em> is a software procedure (see driver) that controls a specific device, for example, a disk drive, sound card, and so on. <br><br>  <em>Duplex, duplex communication</em> - two-way communication between two devices, in which each of them can send and receive messages simultaneously. <br><br>  H <br><br>  <em>Attenuation</em> is a measure of the energy loss in an oscillatory system during the transformation of one form of energy into another. <br><br>  <em>Sound</em> - mechanical vibrations and elastic waves propagating in solid, liquid and gaseous media, mainly in audible frequency ranges (16-20000 Hz). <br><br>  <em>Sound insulation</em> - reducing the impact of sound due to the installation of a reflective (absorbing) wall between the sound source and the place of impact. <br><br>  <em>A</em> sound wave is called a sound wave, the process of propagation of a variable perturbation in an elastic medium, and the oscillatory motion of particles of a medium under the action of this perturbation is called a sound wave. <br><br>  <em>Sound pressure</em> - see sound pressure. <br><br>  <em>Sound power</em> - see sound power. <br><br>  <em>Sound countdown</em> - see countdown. <br><br>  <em>Sound editor</em> - a program designed for the implementation of various transformations and installation of audio data in digital form. <br><br>  <em>Sound absorption</em> - the loss of sound energy when falling sound waves, and their distribution in the material environment.  The sound absorption coefficient of a material is the ratio of the absorbed energy to the incident sound energy.  The characteristic of the ability of a material to absorb sound waves varies from 0 to 1 (sometimes measured as a percentage from 0 to 100%).  At zero sound absorption coefficient, all sound energy is reflected by the surface of the material.  1 - means that all sound energy is absorbed by the material. <br><br>  AND <br><br>  <em>PCM</em> - Pulse Code Modulation.  See PCM. <br><br>  <em>The intensity (strength) of sound</em> is the ratio of the sound power incident on a surface to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis surface.  It is determined both by the amplitudes of all frequency components and by the number of sources that sound simultaneously.  Sound intensity is measured in W / m2 or decibels and is calculated by the formula: I = P / S (W / m2), where P is the power of the sound wave incident on the surface (see below);  S is the surface area.  On average, hearing sensitivity obeys the logarithmic law, that is, the increase in sound intensity in the form of a power function is perceived by the ear as a linear (uniform) increase in volume.  Therefore, to estimate the intensity of sound, it is convenient to use a logarithmic unit, which is decibel.  When measuring the absolute intensity of sound, the reference value Z is taken as the threshold level of hearing of a sinusoidal signal with a frequency of 1000 Hz, which corresponds to an intensity of 10-12 W / m2.  Given the fact that a person‚Äôs ear can distinguish a relative change in intensity by about one tenth of Bell, it is customary to estimate the intensity in decibels (dB or dB): I (dB) = lg (X / 10-12) / 10, where X is the intensity sound, W / m2.  As a result, the hearing threshold is determined by the intensity equal to 0 dB (lg (10-12 / 10-12) / 10 = 0), the intensity of the whisper is about 35 dB, the intensity of the loud voice is about 90 dB.  Pain occurs when the intensity of about 110-130 dB. <br><br>  <em>Interpolation</em> - restoration of the signal between samples;  finding intermediate values ‚Äã‚Äãof a quantity by some of its known values. <br><br>  <em>Interface</em> - a set of software and hardware and protocols designed to organize the interaction of various devices. <br><br>  <em>Interference</em> is the phenomenon of amplification of oscillations in some points of space and weakening of oscillations in other points as a result of the imposition of two or several waves arriving at these points.  The interference of the waves is possible if the phase difference of the waves is constant in time, i.e., the waves are coherent.  Wave interference is valid for waves of any nature and frequency. <br><br>  TO <br><br>  <em>Channel</em> - a set of devices designed to transmit information. <br><br>  <em>Direct Access Channel</em> - see DMA. <br><br>  <em>Quantization (during digitization)</em> is the process of replacing the real values ‚Äã‚Äãof the signal amplitude with approximate ones with a certain accuracy (see digitizing the signal). <br><br>  <em>Cox</em> - see covox. <br><br>  <em>Coherence</em> - see coherent waves. <br><br>  <em>Coherent waves (coupled waves)</em> are waves of the same frequency, the oscillations in which are characterized by a constant phase difference that does not change with time. <br><br>  <em>Codec</em> - see codec. <br><br>  <em>Oscillation</em> is a change in time of a magnitude with respect to a certain selected value of it. <br><br>  <em>Compander (compressor</em> ) - a device or program designed to narrow the dynamic range of the audio signal. <br><br>  <em>Compressor</em> - see compander. <br><br>  <em>The sound absorption coefficient of the material</em> - see sound absorption. <br><br>  M <br><br>  <em>A microphone</em> is an electroacoustic transducer that reacts to sound waves and produces equivalent electrical signals. <br><br>  <em>A mixer</em> is a software or hardware unit designed to adjust the levels of signals in channels and inputs / outputs, as well as to mix signals. <br><br>  <em>Junior quantum</em> - the minimum level of quantization. <br><br>  <em>Multi-timbral (polyphony)</em> - the maximum possible number of simultaneously reproducible instruments. <br><br>  <em>Modulation</em> is a change, according to a given law, in time of the quantities characterizing a regular physical process.  Of practical importance is the modulation of oscillations. <br><br>  <em>Sound power</em> - describes the total sound energy emitted by a sound source per unit of time;  measured in watts (or dBm - decibels per milliwatts).  Sound power is calculated using the following formula: P (dBm) = 10 * lg (P / 1 mW), where P is the sound power measured in mW (used to measure the ‚Äúelectrical output‚Äù of sound equipment).  Some specific sound sources can be characterized by the following approximate figures: <br><ul><li>  Whisper - 10-9 W </li><li>  Talk - 10-5 W </li><li>  Scream - 10-3 W </li><li>  Grand orchestra - 10 W </li><li>  Large turbojet aircraft - 105 W </li></ul><br>  It should be noted that for an electro-acoustic transducer, the acoustic power is less than the electric power conducted.  Kpd  dynamic type loudspeaker is small and a few percent). <br><br>  <em>The musical balance</em> is the semantic balance of the loudness of the sound in the general sound picture: separate groups of instruments, soloists, actors in the performances.  Mb  depends on the correct placement of microphones, mixing, the use of artificial reverberation and frequency correction.  Partial parameters: the correspondence of the result: the score, the script of the performance, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe television and film director, and the real sound.  Examples of flaws: violation of the timbres of individual instruments, groups or voices. <br><br>  <em>Multi</em> - <em>timbral</em> - see multi-timbral. <br><br>  H <br><br>  <em>Continuous spectrum</em> - the spectrum of waves whose frequency components are distributed continuously in the frequency range. <br><br>  <em>Continuous noise</em> is noise whose intensity remains unchanged for an indefinite period of time or a specified period of time. <br><br>  ABOUT <br><br>  <em>Overtone</em> - see harmonica. <br><br>  <em>Octave</em> - unit frequency interval - is determined by the ratio of 2: 1.  The octave is equal to the interval between the two frequencies f1 and f2, the logarithm of the ratio of which is equal to one (log (f2 / f1) = 1), which corresponds to the difference in the frequencies f1 and f2 twice. <br><br>  <em>Octave band</em> - a frequency range in which the highest frequency is twice the lowest frequency. <br><br>  <em>Oscillator</em> - the generator of pure tones (sinusoidal signals). <br><br>  <em>Counting</em> - the numerical value of the signal amplitude at a certain point in time. <br><br>  <em>Signal digitization</em> - fixing the amplitude of an analog signal at certain intervals and recording the obtained amplitude values ‚Äã‚Äãas rounded digital values;  This process as a whole includes two processes - the process of discretization (sampling) and the process of quantizing the amplitude of the signal by level (rounding the amplitude to the nearest integer). <br><br>  <em>The rounding</em> error is the error that occurs when quantizing as a result of rounding the amplitude of the signal to the nearest level of quantization.  The cause of the quantization noise. <br><br>  P <br><br>  <em>Panning</em> - control the level of the signal in the channels, resulting in a change in the position of the imaginary sound source in the stereo panorama. <br><br>  <em>Oversampling</em> - digitizing a signal with a sampling frequency higher than the original one.  The way to reduce the quantization noise. <br><br>  <em>Period</em> - the time for which one complete oscillation takes place. <br><br>  <em>Polyphony</em> - the maximum possible number of simultaneously played simplest sounds (the maximum number of simultaneously running synthesizer generators). <br><br>  <em>Interference</em> - noise (see noise), interfering with the full perception of sound recordings.  Partial parameters: acoustic and electrical noise, interference in the digital path: clicks, loss of information. <br><br>  <em>The threshold of hearing</em> - the minimum intensity of the sound with which the human hearing aid begins to perceive the sound signal.  The threshold of audibility of sound for a person does not remain constant with a change in frequency - the sensitivity of the human ear strongly depends on both the volume of the sound and its frequency.  For example, the threshold of audibility of a signal at a frequency of about 3 kHz is approximately 0 dB, and at a frequency of 200 Hz - about 20 dB.  On the contrary, the pain threshold of hearing depends little on the frequency and ranges from 100-130 dB. <br><br>  <em>Streaming playback</em> - playback of audio data, without waiting for the completion of their acquisition (transmission). <br><br>  <em>Sound transparency</em> is the ability to temporarily and qualitatively distinguish individual sources in a general sound pattern.  Partial parameters: registered sound transparency.  Temporary transparency.  Legibility of the text.  Fusion sound.  Stereo resolution.  The sharpness of localization, the displayed width of point sources of sound.  Examples of disadvantages: the overlap between the individual sound lines (the result of a violation of musical or acoustic balance). <br><br>  <em>The spatial impression of the sound</em> is the perception of the joint action of the sound sources and their spatial environment.  P.V.  characterizes the relationship between the size of the room and the number of performers.  Assessment P.V.  includes a sense of sound perspective in depth and width.  Mutual ratio: the volume of the room and the size of the sounding body, the musical content and acoustic properties of the studio.  Partial parameters: impression of the size of the room.  The duration of the reverb.  The ratio of direct and reflected sounds (acoustic balance).  Acoustic atmosphere.  The timbre of the spatial sound.

Often the effect is realized with a cyclically varying time delay. The result of applying the effect is a floating sound with beats of frequencies or a chorus with altered timbres of copies of the main signal. At a certain ratio of delays, frequency and depth of modulation, it is possible to obtain an effect that resembles the perception of the whistle of a locomotive passing by the listener. In analog devices, flanger is achieved by passing the signal through the comb filters. And this effect was discovered purely by chance, when two tape recorders simultaneously reproduced the same recording in one of them accidentally touched the driven film roll (flange), that is, they actually delayed the playback speed.From the mixing of two phonograms the effect of floating sound arose. This effect surprised the sound engineers with its novelty and later the flanger became widely used in the processing of musical compositions.</font></font><br><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fader</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - the control element of the physical or virtual device parameters (controller, slider, slider, handle). </font></font><br><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Phaser</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - (from the English. ¬´Phase¬ª - phase) - the effect of sounding based on mixing the input signal with its copies shifted within the phase of the signal. Generally speaking, a phase shift is similar to a time shift of a fraction of a millisecond. A phase shift can be applied not to fixed values, but changing according to some phase modulating law. As a result, such an effect may be perceived by the ear as a ‚Äúswinging‚Äù of frequencies, that is, muffling one or the other. In the case of processing a stereo signal, frequencies can ‚Äúcross over‚Äù from one channel to another. In analog technology, phase shifters are used to obtain a phaser. </font></font><br><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Background</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- the background is called the unit volume level. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The volume of the sound is n background if the average listener evaluates it as equal in volume to a tone with a frequency of 1000 Hz and a pressure level of n decibels. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Background as a loudness level, as well as a decibel, is not a unit of measurement, but a twenty-fold decimal logarithm of the sound pressure ratio. </font></font><br><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Formanta</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - areas of greatest energy in the spectrum of voice or musical instruments. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Formants determine the characteristic timbre of the instrument, the voice.</font></font><br><br>  X <br><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chorus (from the English.
