The press briefing was held in the conference center of the Swissotel Red Hill Hotel and was very informative in terms of interesting news and announcements of fresh produce. <br><br><img src="http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/3814/dsc0125xb.jpg" alt="image">

      In addition to the HP Mini 311, I will also talk a little about the netbook from Point of View, as well as the timing of the appearance of products in retail and indicative prices for them. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started with the fact that after some publications on Habr√©, I wanted to get some information on the ION platform and its future from the first, so to speak, lips.  All that was enough for me was to send an e-mail to the nVidia PR manager Irina Shekhovtsova.  What was my surprise when she answered me and not just answered, and after not very long correspondence, invited me to this press briefing.  Judging by the allocated badge, I turned out to be the <a href="">official representative of Habrahabr</a> .  =) <br><br>  Of course, I did not position myself so, but cited several of my reviews as confirmation of my sincere interest in the ION platform.  Well, that's not the point.  Let's return to our sheep. <br><br><h4>  HP Mini 311 (Compaq Mini 311) </h4>  ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/netbook/69591/">announcement here</a> ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/05f/580/a5a/05f580a5aae0d9667b05ef970fe58bce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Brief TTX</b> : <br>  Screen: 11.6 "1366 x 768px <br>  CPU: Intel Atom N270 <br>  RAM: 1GB DDR3 <br>  HDD: 160GB <br>  Netbook dimensions: 289x204x19 mm <br>  Weight: 1.46 kg <br>  Battery: 6-cell.  (7 hours on XP, 5 hours on Win7) <br>  Other: Wi-Fi, 4-in-1 card reader, 3 USB ports, webcam, HDMI, D-Sub. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de1/5a1/f0b/de15a1f0b4548b3f8ba0cec7826b4656.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd4/954/554/bd4954554b00acdcdf175855d120fc4d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f35/9af/ba5/f359afba5cce5636a3d6d70c59544597.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b0b/278/052/b0b278052edd4cb957ce092045a6c92c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main chip of the netbook is of course announced support for fullHD-video and CUDA.  In addition to this, the Mini 311 has a screen with 720p support.  This was repeatedly praised by nVidia engineers, due to the appearance of a scrollbar in netbooks with a standard resolution of 1024x600px. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/424/7d5/b5b/4247d5b5bd22c8ad3dfa7d90c4f65704.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In her presentation, Irina positioned the netbook as the first or second PC in the family, relying on its great multimedia capabilities.  If a regular netbook was positioned as a "spare" or "child", then 311, theoretically, can compete in performance with the low-end segment of laptops or home media centers.  In specific tasks, of course. <br><br><img src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/8718/dsc0108l.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As such tasks are mainly considered some modern games, video processing applications and graphic editors that support acceleration using CUDA.  In the list of modern working games, in addition to the annoying CoD4, you can find: Spore, Red Alert 3, Sims and others.  All, alas, I do not remember, later lay out a presentation with the details.  Those interested can podrazognavat games with pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b6d/fa8/43b/b6dfa843b4c2ddec17d52b90f06fb999.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As an example of specialized software, Total Media Theater is preinstalled on a netbook, which, if purchased separately, will cost $ 100.  At its core, TMT is an enhancer for DVD-Video that brings its quality to HD.  It looks really impressive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60c/863/611/60c8636118a83883987dc01181e57041.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  During the presentation, the engineering sample of the netbook was connected to an LCD TV in 1080p mode and compared with the Eee-PC connected to it.  I was not interested in the model, but the result of most graphical tests is predictable.  For example, video transcoding for ipod via Badaboom with CUDA support was up to 6 times faster than via iTunes on the Eee-PC. <br><br>  Well, of course FullHD video in 1080p format.  Without lags, with sound for HDMI and without any complaints.  The video was shown first on the TV, and then on the netbook‚Äôs own screen.  After, according to tradition, drove in CoD4 at a resolution of 720p.  Not at all impressive in my opinion.  You can play, but the entourage is lost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d71/c80/1d2/d71c801d29a7ec1f3cd9272e7317ae8e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Finally, the performance rating according to Windows 7. According to the engineers of nVidia, the rating on 3D graphics should be higher as soon as normal drivers adapted to 7-ku appear. <br><br>  In general, I really liked the device.  Here it will be sold under the Compaq brand and the main OS is currently XP.  After the release of 7-ki, netbooks promised to transfer to it. <br><br>  It's funny, but recently in M-Video, I saw two identical netbooks from HP ... It seems like it was 2140. So, the difference on identical models with HP nameplates and Compaq nameplates was 5000r.  For the sake of decency, HP added 1/10 of an inch to the size of the screen, and it was only with this that the M-Video manager, who came running up to advise me, was able to justify himself. <br><br>  But that's not all.  Earlier than the HP Mini 311, the Point of View Mobii ION 230 will appear on the counters. <br><br><h4>  Point of View Mobii ION 230 </h4>  ( <a href="http://abadd0n.habrahabr.ru/blog/70774/">announcement here</a> ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1fd/c5c/2d4/1fdc5c2d447fe5659024f3c1751f1777.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Brief TTX</b> : <br>  Screen: 10.2 "1366 x 768px <br>  CPU: Intel Atom N230 <br>  RAM: 1GB DDR3 <br>  HDD: 160GB <br>  Battery: 6-cell. <br>  Other: Wi-Fi, 4-in-1 card reader, 2 USB ports, webcam, HDMI. <br><br>  Mobii ION, in fact, is the younger brother of the Mini 311. It differs mainly in the size of the screen, the processor and the lack of a VGA output.  True to us, a nice green modification, if it arrives, is not so soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/482/45d/366/48245d3666f9e01ddde2dfca5610eae6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3c/015/606/a3c015606407af8e6967e54ebf76e3b9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>And finally, the timing of the appearance of netbooks on sale.</b> <br><br>  The first batch of <i>Point of View Mobii ION 230</i> in black, will call in MediaMarkt <b>on October 8</b> at a price of <b>15999r</b> . <br>  The party <i>Compaq Mini 311</i> is expected in late October, in the same MediaMarkt, with an estimated (recommended) price of <b>18000r</b> .  <s>As far as this price is real, we will certainly see (recalling M-Video prices), but on the whole it‚Äôs not bad.</s>  Looking at <a href="http://price.ru/bin/price/prodlist%3Fcid%3D01020113%26curr%3D2%26vcid%3D01010206%26base%3D1%26pnam%3Dhp%2520mini%2520311%26where%3D00">price.ru</a> , chances to fit into the recommended price increase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62c/bf6/662/62cbf6662bee7b33bded4743f0073102.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to all this, there was still a piece of confidential information that I will be able to disclose only after the 5th of October.  Well, up to this point I plan to have time to lay out a photo report on the nettops presented at the press briefing, including those not previously announced. <br><br>  <b>Upd</b> <br>  Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  A little exclusive for the seed - according to nVidia engineers, <b>ION 2</b> can wait for the next six months.  The technical features of the platform are still covered in gloom, but the company's employees are already aware of the details, so we just have to wait. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70864/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70864/</a></p>
