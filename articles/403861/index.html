  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Something wrong is happening to Masterhost.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Caught in a rather difficult situation.  The technical support staff of the company Masterhost refused to fulfill the client application, namely, to put the mail log file requested through the personal account.  We do not know what to do ... </p><br><p>  The essence of the problem is this: Some time ago, users of an online store began to complain that mail stopped coming from one of the sites (order confirmations, etc. services implemented on the site via php scripts).  A small investigation showed that problems are observed only among the owners of the boxes ... @ mail.ru </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4e5/826/f21/4e5826f2144bef87e46c9e0c099cd26a.jpg" alt="image"><br><p>  We found a person who was ready to understand the problem, and the only thing he needed to work was the mail logs from the hoster.  And we are hosted (it seems, you can already write "hosted") on Masterhost.  This was unexpectedly the problem ... </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li><p>  It all started pretty well.  After the call to technical support and a detailed explanation of the problem, the employee vigorously promised, we will lay out the logs you need without problems, and the only thing you need to do is send an authorized request through the control panel.  What was immediately done (at 13:30). </p><br></li><li><p>  Less than an hour, the answer came, but instead of the promised log file, there was a question about which address the letters did not reach.  "Well, apparently, the person, before sending us the log file, decided to try to figure it out," I thought thankfully, and said one of the addresses where the problem was observed. </p><br></li><li><p>  An hour of waiting again passed, but in the letter that arrived, there were no logs again.  Instead, there was a statement that everything works correctly, and in confirmation of this, a line from the coveted log file was attached, confirming that today there was a fact that this address received letters from Masterhost's servers.  True, from another domain ... I had to (hiding a slight irritation), to explain again that it was coming from one domain, it was not coming from another ... but we need a log file, which we wrote about in the application!  Perform, they say the application already, in the end !!! </p><br></li><li><p>  The next letter we waited 2.5 hours.  What do you think were logs in it?  No, they were not there again.  But there were a few more lines confirming that several letters came from the problem domain.  By this time (and it was happening on Friday), the programmer, who promised to sort it out, referred to urgent matters, and with the words: ‚ÄúContinue to play your toys further, but they are waiting for me at home on Friday,‚Äù left: (We are not losing hopes that the log will be sent to us all the same, continued correspondence. </p><br></li><li><p>  We waited for the next answer for another 2 hours.  The clock on the wall struck 19:00, when the next answer came ... and again without the requested log file !!!  In the letter, the person who started our endless dialogue five hours ago with a request to indicate a specific file was interested this time, at a specific time when problems were noticed.  Those who remained in the office were already boiling.  :) To finally stop this idiocy, we called Masterhost once again and the polite employee promised (it turned out he also lied) that he would make a note on our ticket that we needed not a correspondence, but a log file, and they would send it to the nearest time.  At the same time, our programmer, swearing in his voice, gathered a test form on his knee, and registered a fresh account on mail.ru so that the young man who doesn‚Äôt let us leave for the weekend even had potential questions about the problem.  Then, - we naively thought, - he will have mercy, and all the same fucking log file will be sent to us !!! </p><br></li><li>  At 20:21 we received (we won‚Äôt get the logs, it became obvious) a short letter with the advice: ‚ÄúYour letters reached and fell into the SPAM folder, for what reason - check mail.ru‚Äù </li></ol><br><p>  ... and in the mailbox created, there really were three letters from the joker from Masterhost: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a0/0d5/3fb/7a00d53fbf1d46cddecd17adb75cb505.jpg" alt="image"><br><p>  Further correspondence, apparently, is meaningless. </p><br><p>  We sit now and think what to do in such cases?  Actually, the options are not so much: </p><br><ul><li><p>  maybe this topic will be read by one of the adequate employees of Masterhost, and will send us a mail log file for 12.05.2017 to the contact address indicated on the ticket [masterhost.ru @: 30122215776].  Anonymity is guaranteed. </p><br></li><li><p>  maybe someone has contacts of sane employees of the Masterhost, because there are normal people there, one hundred percent.  Throw off in a personal contact, if not difficult. </p><br></li><li><p>  can wait until the change changes and try to request a log from another, more sane "specialist"? </p><br></li><li>  or use the weekend to move to another hoster? </li></ul><br><p>  <strong>UPD:</strong> Exactly one day after submitting our request, the log file was uploaded !!!  At 13:20 of the next day, we, without any repeated requests, received a letter indicating where you can pick up the dump we requested for the indicated day.  Those.  the employee, who carried the brain yesterday to us all day long, understood from the very beginning what we needed, but for some reason, he decided to ‚Äúplay with us‚Äù.  Apparently, the TP Masterhost, there are instructions on the timing of the satisfaction of customer requests, and the deadline on the application - 24 hours.  That is why, having submitted an application on 12.05.2017 at 13:30, we received the requested file on 13.05.2017 at 13:20.  I sincerely want to believe that this is the tyranny of an individual employee, and not the policy of the company's management. </p><br><p>  <strong>UPD2:</strong> As a result, the situation was resolved as follows: </p><br><ul><li>  After the Return-path field in our mail, sent by scripts from the site, was changed to our mailbox, the very first letter that arrived at it was received from mail.ru, which we sent for trial to mail.ru support service.  After 4 days, a brief answer came from them, saying that the problem was eliminated, check.  And, indeed, the letters sent through the mail () function began to reach. </li><li>  In parallel with this, thanks to the advice of commentators to this topic, they have altered the sending of mail from the site via the SMTP masterhost.  That helped!  Letters also began to reach. </li><li>  The answer came from the management, the essence of which is as follows (I quote) "You are right, the processing of the application really dragged on, although the answer to it should have been voiced immediately."  It was also mentioned in the letter that the details on the incident were sent by some people interested in the situation.  Useful life hack, by the way!  You can get information on your site only through an authorized request, and for someone else‚Äôs - just through a letter to the management. </li><li>  In the course of the correspondence, another detail of our interaction came to light.  Surprisingly, judging by the reaction of the audience, people are much more concerned not with the fact of stretching the simplest service for a day (open a file, select three dozen lines, Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V, send to the client), but the text of the host‚Äôs test letter.  Finally, managed to get to the bottom of this reason.  :) It turns out that when, after 7 hours of asking for excerpts from the logs, our programmer compiled a test script for the masterhost employee, he, in no less crude form, expressed his opinion on the level of professionalism of this employee.  After that, this "specialist" is just ... offended!  I sincerely apologize for the weak stress tolerance of my programmer, and I am ready to confirm to the leadership of the company masterhost that the words of your employee: "And he first started ..." are absolutely fair! </li></ul><cut></cut></div>
