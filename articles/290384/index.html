  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As we went for subsidies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello colleagues!  In this article I will try to tell as much as possible about how we tried to get subsidies in Omsk for the development of small and medium-sized businesses.  The article will focus on the Omsk Employment Center in the Lenin Administrative District. <br><br>  The idea to apply to the CZ for subsidies came from the TV, where in one of the news reports they talked about the allocation of subsidies for the development of entrepreneurship.  By the time of contacting the CZ, we have a working <a href="http://rentalist.me/">site</a> and a team of three people.  One of the founders already has a legal entity, so legally we did not plan to register our activities, but planned to attract additional funds to promote the project.  These are the input data, and now the story itself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before heading out, I poured information about subsidies for small and medium-sized businesses in Omsk; we could not quickly find any data on the method of receipt, the amount, the rules for participation in the competition, contact persons responsible for issuing subsidies.  Therefore, on April 13, 2015, I went to the Employment Center to find out about everything on the spot.  Having got to the informant, the following information was received: <br><br>  <i>In order to participate in the grant competition, you first need to officially become unemployed.</i>  With this, let's begin. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      This status can be obtained at the Employment Center by registration, that is, if you have a Leninsky district in your passport, then you should go to the Leninsky CL.  To do this, you must have the following documents with you: <br><ol><li>  Passport + copies of the second and third pages, as well as pages with registration at the place of residence; </li><li>  Certificate of average earnings in the last place of work (form of certificate of the established sample); </li><li>  Employment record + copies of all pages with records and other documents confirming the length of service (contracts, certificates); </li><li>  The document on professional qualification + its copy; </li><li>  TIN (original only); </li><li>  Insurance certificate of state pension insurance (original only). </li></ol><br>  Persons with disabilities 1, 2, 3 groups, in addition to these documents, are required to provide: <br><ol><li>  ITU help + copy; </li><li>  Individual program of rehabilitation of the disabled person + copy. </li></ol><br>  But you can‚Äôt just register and become unemployed, having passed all the documents listed above. <br><br>  Firstly, it takes 10 days from the moment of registration to assign a coveted status. <br><br>  Secondly, after registering, for some reason you are given a referral to work, although intentions are spoken at the interview with the employee of the CZ.  In general, within three days you need to go to the address indicated in the direction and try not to get a job, because in this case you will not be given subsidies.  You can certainly not go, but there is a chance that you will be removed from the registration. <br><br>  Thirdly, exactly three days after registration, you are invited to an interview for vocational guidance and are offered to undergo training in various working specialties.  You can refuse.  On the same day, it is necessary to bring a signed referral to work, preferably with a refusal of employment. <br><br>  On the very first day of the visit, I got an appointment with the deputy head of the CZ.  Not without difficulty, we managed to learn from him the rules for obtaining subsidies: <br><ol><li>  You must be officially unemployed; </li><li>  Be sure to pass three tests for suitability to business, the entire testing process takes about 30 minutes: <br>  - Test Holland.  Methods of professional self-determination; <br>  - CBS (identification of communicative and organizational inclinations); <br>  - Self-esteem personal qualities of the entrepreneur. </li><li>  Write a business plan.  Issue a <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/NlCC7-hWgVHPA">template and recommendations for drafting</a> . </li></ol><br>  So, after 10 days we come to the Employment Center with a passport, a workbook and an account opened with Sberbank.  From this day you officially become unemployed.  On the same day, they can voluntarily-compulsorily send them to a lecture about starting their own business.  At first, it seemed to me dull and senseless, but in the end it saved time, because it was on her that I realized that it was not the best idea to attract subsidies to the CH. <br><br>  The lecture was attended by 8-10 people of different ages, someone came just like that, and someone clearly planned to open a business.  The first 15 minutes we were told about the rules of writing a business plan, later allowed to ask questions.  After a dozen questions, the following became clear: <br><br>  - Winners of previous years: photo studio, organization of holidays, sale of accessories for mobile phones; <br>  - In the year for one CL of the Leninsky district, 2 subsidies are granted for starting a business; <br>  - One of the prerequisites for obtaining a subsidy is the creation of an additional workplace, respectively, 135,000 is divided into two: the founder (70,000) and a hired employee (65,000); <br>  - The selection of business plans lasts a month, the final decision is made by the Omsk Regional Business Incubator; <br>  - 70 000 must be spent immediately.  65 can be stretched for a period of time; <br>  - A hired employee selects CH.  You can offer your candidacy, but the person must be recognized as officially unemployed; <br>  - Money is allocated free of charge if all the conditions of the contract are met, if the conditions are not met, then the money will have to be returned in full; <br>  - Terms of the contract (approximately): <br><ol><li>  Business must exist at least 2 years; </li><li>  An employee must also work for you for at least 2 years.  If the employee leaves, then you need to take another, if you do not hire an employee for a certain period of time, then this will entail a breach of contract. </li></ol><br>  Approximately, we consider expenses for 2 years: <br><ol><li>  Register LLC or IP = 5000 - 10 000 rubles; </li><li>  Taxes = 124,000 rubles; <br>  If we assume that the manager and the employee will be set the minimum wage set at 6000 rubles, then at a rate of 43% for two years it will be necessary to pay approximately 124,000. the plan.  And who will go for 6000. </li><li>  Office = 360,000 for 2 years. <br>  Doing home business is unlikely to be allowed.  Utility and other related expenses, about 15,000 per month. </li></ol><br>  <b>Total: 489 000 rubles for 2 years.</b> <br><br>  As a result, we decided not to participate in the competition of subsidies and withdrew our candidacy.  Guided by the following considerations: <br>  - for the organization of reception of payments and other official events there is an existing LLC; <br>  - the staff recommended by the center of employment is sort of like without us; <br>  - the amount of the costs of servicing a business organized for subsidies is higher than the amount of the subsidy provided. <br><br>  Conclusions: the institute of granting state subsidies is certainly a useful and attractive idea, but only for those entrepreneurs who in any case plan to create an LLC, or register as an IP. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290384/</a></p>
