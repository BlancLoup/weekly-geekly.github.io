Similar methods are used in other samples of malware.  The topic of comparison between Stuxnet and Duqu is disclosed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159533">here</a> .  With a connection Gauss and Flame generally related funny <a href="http://blogs.computerra.ru/37814">case</a> .  Employees of Kaspesky Lab organized a sinkhole router.  Simply put, we are talking about creating fake control centers, which are beginning to be perceived by malicious programs as their own.  Thus, it becomes possible to estimate the extent of infections and their geographical distribution by analyzing the IP addresses of incoming connections.  In some cases, it even allows you to take control and give a command to self-destruct, which, however, is rare.  At the sinkhole, the router brought traffic to it from Gauss and Flame.  And the specialists of FireEye, finding that Gauss and Flame are accessing the same server, concluded that the same people were behind the development of these malware.  A little later, FireEye made a public apology for her mistake and misrepresentation. <br>  Thus, all attempts to link Stuxnet, Duqu, Flame and Gauss to each other are not very impressive.  In addition, it would be too costly to develop a new sample of malware for different operations, it would be enough to change the existing one to eliminate the possibility of detection by anti-virus tools and increase the functionality of the modules.  It is quite probable that we observe only the tip of the iceberg of events occurring in the Middle East, and the data of VPO are developed by different countries or organizations that are not related to each other.  The following key players can be distinguished in the arena of cyberwar: the USA, China, Russia, Israel, South Korea.  In addition, it is clear that local players have also connected here - some samples of HVT are written in Deplhi (Madi, Shamoon, Narilam), which is an indicator of insufficient professional work, but they successfully perform their tasks of collecting and deleting information. <br>  Summary: <br><ul><li>  Antivirus companies unnecessarily "inflate" the topic of cyberwar, manipulating facts.  They do this to expand markets.  It would be better to tell you how well all their heuristic methods, proactive defenses and sandboxes work if VPO has been doing its ‚Äúdark‚Äù work for years; </li><li>  Do not trust the news sites, there are too many decorations.  Ideally, it is not bad to read the articles in the original, but they do not speak English well, and the search for primary sources also requires a certain amount of patience. </li></ul><br>  But in any case, despite all the distortions of antivirus companies, we will follow with interest the development of cyber weapons. </div>
