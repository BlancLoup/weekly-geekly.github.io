    <h2>  Goals and opportunities of ITOM </h2><br>  ITOM ( <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/it-operations-management-upravlenie-it-infrastrukturoy/">IT Operations Management</a> ) is a process that aims to automate the management of the company's IT infrastructure.  Using ITOM, you can collect information about the elements of the infrastructure and monitor the status of individual services and systems.  This will help detect problems and solve them without costly maintenance downtime. <br><br>  According <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2014/07/16/the-cost-of-downtime/">to</a> Gartner, the average cost per minute of downtime of IT equipment in data centers of companies costs 5.6 thousand dollars or 140-540 thousand dollars per hour.  For example, last year in the data center of the airline British Airways failed, as a result of which flights were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-airports-heathrow/british-airways-vows-never-again-after-costly-it-collapse-idUSKBN18P01O">canceled</a> for 75 thousand passengers.  The company had <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-astonishing-hidden-and-personal-costs-of-it-downtime-and-how-predictive-analytics-might-help/">to pay</a> about $ 68 million in compensation. <br><br>  The goal of ITOM is to increase the efficiency of management processes and, as a result, the work of the entire company.  Interestingly, the often routine tasks of detecting, diagnosing, and solving problems often become the cause of new errors that entail more serious failures.  ITOM allows you to resolve this situation and optimize business processes.  As a solution, ServiceNow has <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/sbor-informatsii-ob-infrastrukture-s-pomoshchyu-modulya-discovery-protsessa-itom-servicenow/">developed a</a> comprehensive set of modules.  It includes: <br><br><ul><li>  Module to collect information about the structure of Discovery; </li><li>  Event management module (event management); </li><li>  Module for intelligent problem determination and troubleshooting (operational Intelligence); </li><li>  Automation module of routine IT processes; </li><li>  Service Topology Building Module; </li><li>  Cloud Resource Management Module. </li></ul><br>  The core of the entire service is the Discovery module, since it allows you to get information about the components of the infrastructure.  It forms the current database of objects, displays the dependencies and tracks all changes.  The information that Discovery collects can be used to automatically update the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) and work with other ITOM services.  To get acquainted with the capabilities of the ServiceNow Discovery module, we suggest that you look at our <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/servicenow-itom-modul-discovery-video/">tutorial</a> : <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fBIQQ7JqD8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  What does it give </h2><br>  ServiceNow offers a universal ITOM solution - it was implemented by hundreds of large companies from various fields of activity: media, telecommunications, service and others.  We give examples for these industries. <br><br><h5>  Media companies: Time Warner case </h5><br>  ITOM tools <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/it-operations-management-upravlenie-it-infrastrukturoy/">track the</a> state of the IT infrastructure in real time.  Time Warner took advantage of this opportunity, <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/case-studies/cs-time-warner-event-management-and-it-operations.pdf">simplifying</a> incident handling. <br><br>  Initially, all information about the events came to a single email address, letters from which were manually viewed by Service Desk employees.  The introduction of ITOM and the integration of several tools for different departments on the same ServiceNow platform made it possible to single out the highest priority incidents, which reduced their total number. <br><br><h5>  Telecommunication companies </h5><br>  The American mobile operator, who wished to remain anonymous, also <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/case-studies/cs-wireless-carrier-saves-five-million-dollars.pdf">spoke</a> about his experience with the ServiceNow platform and ITOM tools. <br><br>  Before the introduction of Cloud Management (solutions for managing cloud resources), the company could not boast of high speed customer service - on average, it took up to 5 days to provide a virtual machine. <br><br>  Since the service was automated, this time was reduced to 1 hour, and the operator was able to reallocate resources in favor of other workloads.  This allowed the supplier to save 5 million dollars a year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-7/63/fy/-763fyvgfroc9cimorz79rorvd4.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/carleasingmadesimpletm/10723066213/">Car leasing made simple</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h5>  Service companies: KAR and ServiceNow cases </h5><br>  Another example is the KAR Auction Services auto auction <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/kak-avtoauktsion-kar-vnedryaet-itom/">case</a> .  The company sought to improve the customer focus of the business and deploy IT processes in the direction of performing tasks that directly affect the quality of service and customer perception of the level of service. <br><br>  First, the company introduced CMDB and used <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/discovery.html">ServiceNow Discovery</a> to fill <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/discovery.html">it</a> .  Then, KAR combined the CMDB and ITIL processes, and then implemented event management and service topology. <br><br>  The company has implemented a single source of information about all the events in the corporate environment.  Creating an alert, KAR necessarily formed the procedure associated with it, in order to know exactly the procedure for its operation. <br><br>  This approach <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/kak-avtoauktsion-kar-vnedryaet-itom/">allowed</a> building a flexible ITOM-ecosystem, and the quality of services, as noted in the company, has noticeably improved.  In the future, KAR plans to automate the configuration of the infrastructure and create a business services catalog. <br><br>  It is significant that ServiceNow also <a href="https://servicematters.servicenow.com/2018/01/17/servicenow-uses-itom-reduce-p1-p2-incidents-67/">uses</a> IT infrastructure management tools: Event Management, which automatically integrates with CMDB and ITSM processes, as well as Service Mapping. <br><br>  Thanks to these products, the company <a href="https://servicematters.servicenow.com/2018/01/17/servicenow-uses-itom-reduce-p1-p2-incidents-67/">was able to</a> reduce the number of minor events (‚Äúnoise‚Äù) by 98% using automatic prioritization of tickets (36 thousand events turned into 529 incidents), save 9,600 hours (per year) by automatically managing alerts, reducing the total number of incidents by 67% and save 780 thousand dollars by automating processes. <br><br>  <i>Selection of materials from our corporate blog:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/servicenow-itom-modul-discovery-video/">ServiceNow ITOM: Discovery Module Overview</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/sbor-informatsii-ob-infrastrukture-s-pomoshchyu-modulya-discovery-protsessa-itom-servicenow/">ServiceNow Discovery: How to Collect Infrastructure Information</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/kompaniya-splat-avtomatizirovala-it-protsessy-na-platforme-servicenow-/">SPLAT has automated IT processes on the ServiceNow platform.</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/it-operations-management-upravlenie-it-infrastrukturoy/">IT Infrastructure Management: How ITOM Helps IT</a> </li></ul><br>  Several recent articles from our blog on Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-guild/blog/345624/">Identity Management: a new tool in ServiceNow for managing credentials</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-guild/blog/345622/">ServiceNow Kingston Update: Machine Learning Functions and Now Platform Upgrades</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345628/</a></p>
