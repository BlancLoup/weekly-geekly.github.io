The method can really work in cases where the ‚Äúinstantaneous‚Äù motivation to work is lost. <br><br>  The reason for the loss of this type of motivation, in contrast to the long-term - a little.  First reason: Your manager, who was unable to motivate you (or, no matter how insulting it sounds, can be effectively used as a resource).  The second reason: routine work, which has already accumulated a lot.

      But if to deal not with the cause, but with the consequence, then it is sometimes very difficult to find that very ‚Äúsmall interesting task‚Äù, and it is often too lazy to look for it.  Therefore, I offer the attention of habrazhiteley five simple, proven in practice ways to find the very first interesting task.  But they work, if you need a friendly pat on the back, and not a magic Pendel. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Help a colleague </h4><br>  Probably the easiest and fastest way.  Remember, when was the last time a colleague approached you, and you frantically turning off the browser somehow otmazyvatsya from him?  Remember, he came up and asked to see why his program is not compiled?  Or the designer asked where on the server of the company is the plug-in for photoshop you use?  Or the HR department tearfully asked to fill the timeshield?  Or when that pretty girl from the sales department asked to set up Wi-Fi on her personal netbook?  Remember? <br><br>  Stand up, go to them and help with their small request.  It often happens that this becomes the first and interesting task. <br><br>  By the way, you can use the method in the opposite direction - ask for a little help in things that you are not sure about.  The main thing is to immediately translate the information received in the project. <br><br><h4>  Arrange Kansas City Shuffle </h4><br>  I remember well the moment when I lost the Internet while on the road, and my smartphones were discharged.  During the three hours that the laptop battery was holding, the work I had to do in a day was completely completed.  Of course, there were no films or games on the working machine. <br><br>  On the other hand, at that moment I also procrastinated, but instead of reading bashorg, habr and twitter, I did my job.  I just made a substitution, because according to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe conductor some lowly-minded action movie was supposed to look.  And instead of one tedious occupation, I started doing more interesting. <br><br>  In principle, the problem is almost always solved by disconnecting from the network and removing all distracting programs from the computer.  Except how to work, you will have nothing more. <br><br>  I just want to remind you how slowly the time flows when the tasks are completed, until the end of the working day another half hour and you don‚Äôt want to take a new one.  The ‚Äútopless bottom‚Äù page is read in three minutes, and it seems like an eternity. <br><br><h4>  Divide </h4><br>  Of course, I'm talking about the Pareto principle (which is not a ‚Äúprinciple‚Äù, and has nothing to do with Pareto, but there is a rational grain in it).  Remember, in order to complete the task by 80%, you need to spend only 20% of the time allotted for its execution.  And if you, like me, split up your tasks in such a way that each of them does not take more than two days to complete, then you will need a little more than three hours to do most of the work. <br><br>  After that, I advise you to enable recursion in the method.  After all, in order for the task to be ready almost completely, you need even less time. <br><br><h4>  Challenge </h4><br>  Remember that picture in which they say "arrange the meeting"?  At the meeting, you can make mistakes in architecture, interface and everything else, or discuss the pros and cons of cycles with a postcondition in the context of financial statements, or discuss what is more relevant: ‚Äúint‚Äù or ‚Äúlongint‚Äù for SQL sampling, taking into account scaling.  So, after the meeting, the protocol is most often written by the one who organized it.  On the one hand, they defended their position, on the other hand, the protocol began to emphasize your opinion, and it is pleasant to write it. <br><br>  This can also include a dispute with oneself / a colleague with variations on the themes ‚Äúwho implements faster‚Äù, ‚Äúwhose task the customer will accept earlier‚Äù, ‚Äúin whose code the QA will find fewer bugs‚Äù ... And if the quarterly bonus will still be in September, a box of beer on Friday is a great motivator for the whole week. <br><br><h4>  Enter the rhythm of the environment </h4><br>  The old way that works in cases where everything is completely routine and running.  The scheme is approximately as follows: <br><br>  On Monday, do not work the first and last hour.  Tea, coffee, contact, twitter, something-there-else.  After twenty minutes of digging the Augean stables ‚Äúthrough you‚Äù, take ten minutes of talking to the cooler, or reading chips and dirty.  Then again twenty minutes "through myself."  Just reward yourself with a procrastination for doing your chores.  On Tuesday, reduce the time of idleness by half.  That is, half an hour in the morning and evening, and for five minutes - in breaks. <br><br>  By Wednesday, you and you will be able to start work ‚Äúas soon as you do it at once,‚Äù and procrastination will take the very ten minutes per hour that many employers take for a smoke break. <br><br>  Do not forget to repeat the scheme on Tuesday on Friday. <br><br>  PS Probably, the topic would have looked better in the Infosphere, but it didn‚Äôt have enough karma. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147000/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147000/</a></p>
