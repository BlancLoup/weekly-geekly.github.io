  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing card processing outside of Runet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://pixhost.info/avaxhome/f4/fa/0014faf4.png" align="left" alt="image">  As you know, the Russian is well the German death.  Those who faced the issue of accepting payments on the Internet know this well: payment systems that are popular in RuNet are not known outside of it, and Western online payment methods are practically not used in Russia.  It is true that in the West it is very common to pay with cards, but those who think that having connected to one of the available on the RuNet card billing systems are mistaken can solve all the problems of accepting payments from Western buyers.  This raises questions about the ‚Äúpermeability‚Äù of billing (not all foreign cards are accepted by Russian banks), about the increased commission charged for international purchases and when converting the buyer's currency into the currency of the store, about fraud protection, etc.  As long as we are talking about a small business or a business with insignificant turnover other than Runet, you should not worry, but if your monthly turnover on foreign cards approaches 10,000 dollars, you need to think about whether it makes sense to optimize the receipt of card payments by connecting to a foreign payment processor.  Here a logical question arises: where to find such a processor?  And having already found several alternatives, which processor to choose?  The correct answer to this question means a good partnership and the absence of a headache.  The wrong answer leads to loss of time and effort to connect, as well as loss of orders. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The <b><a href="http://www.paymentsrus.com/">Payments-R-Us service</a></b> , which appeared last year, helps to answer this question correctly.  Having years of working with payment systems all over the world, the service creators automated the process of choosing a partner to receive payments.  Logging on to the site and answering questions about your needs in the field of receiving payments, you will see a list of processors that are suitable for you, you can leave your details so that their representatives contact you and, in addition, you can leave a request for the Payments-R-Us employee to contact with you to discuss additional options not present on the site.  It is worth noting that the service is completely free for customers. <br><br>  For Russian users, such industries as international payments, payment of digital goods (digital goods), as well as payments with an increased level of risk (high-risk), seem to be of the greatest interest.  These groups include many organizations that are always looking for the best ways to accept payments: from software developers to travel ticket booking sites and Forex.
