But I did not separate working hours from personal time.  It often happened to wake up at 7 in the morning and, without really changing my clothes, to run at the computer for the beginning of the working day - and so almost without stopping until the night.  For the world around me, I became as if lost!

      Needless to say, such a regime cannot last for long.  Therefore, I want to share with my readers my own thoughts about how not to lose inspiration, focus and productivity while working from home, while leading a full-fledged colorful life outside of work. <br><br>  I offer 6 main ways to <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-perestat-otvlekatsya-na-rabochem-meste-6-effektivnykh-sposobov/">maintain concentration</a> and productivity, to fully enjoy the pleasures of working from home! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Grouping tasks</font> </h2><br>  Similar tasks should be combined in Google Calendar into temporary groups.  With this approach, if something changes in the plans, then instead of redistributing individual tasks, you can move a whole group of them, managing to cope with work during the same week!  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-glavnykh-pravil-dlya-raboty-na-domu/">Work from home</a> is a great blessing that allows you to be more flexible in time.  This benefit must be used for its intended purpose in order to have even more time.  Between the individual tasks, a 60-second pause is needed - and the joy of the next completed work step before the next one. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Physical activity</font> </h2><br>  Set yourself a timer - “reminder”, which will force you to rise from your seat and move: go outside, unfold an exercise mat, climb a horizontal bar or a small trampoline.  The trampoline, by the way, has a great effect on the circulatory system, carefully neutralizing the harmful substances that have accumulated in the body. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Sundays - kitchen action!</font> </h2><br>  This is a real passion and ritual for many!  While cooking, I prefer to go over the Netflix channels, turn on my favorite radio, or even “read” an audiobook.  And no need to spend a few hours daily for cooking.  Instead, you can cook on weekends, choosing simple, but very pleasant dishes.  Especially good nutritional food, which supports and concentration, and energy.  The easiest way to choose such food in grocery stores, not paying attention to the semi-finished products that are not as tasty and healthy as they simply saturate the body. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Planning social life</font> </h2><br>  Work from home will easily turn even the most sociable person into an ascetic hermit, cutting off his social contacts with others.  Once a week you need to get out of the sink, go out into the light, talk to girls, have fun with friends, meet people who light up our lives.  A place for such plans should always be found even in a very busy calendar.  Personal meetings (or just a plan to have lunch with a friend) should occur as often as possible. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Love for oneself</font> </h2><br>  Radical days of health and beauty should be regular.  The body loves when the skin is pampered with a scrub;  face like nourishing mask.  Performance perfectly restores massage, modern acupuncture (or even completely - still rare, but very entertaining Japanese therapeutic procedures "Reiki").  Fresh flowers around the workspace will add a special atmosphere.  A clean room will begin to "breathe" in a new way.  These procedures directly affect the quality of work and creative energy, and not only the workflow, but also all life aspects. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. Places that inspire</font> </h2><br>  More productivity is born in rooms with natural light.  Good for maintaining high performance and a variety of coffee shops, libraries or centers - co-working for collaboration.  Good work will be born where you feel appropriate.  In the summer it's great to work in the fresh air.  Why not?  (In the end, you can do it right now!). <br><br>  And what are the ways to maintain productivity of labor used by readers?  Share your techniques in the comments - continue the conversation! <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/7-prakticheskikh-sovetov-dlya-uspeshnoy-udalennoy-raboty/">7 practical tips for successful remote work.</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289354/</a></p>
