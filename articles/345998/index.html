  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is it bad to be an excellent student</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am an excellent student.  Of course, not quite the one with the folded handles, the five on the behavior and ironed collar.  But the gold medal, olympiads, red diplomas in the amount of three pieces and other attributes of ‚Äúschool‚Äù success are evident.  I have been working in business for 11 years now - all this time in IT: a testing engineer, a VoIP engineer, a commerce.  I work well, almost do not find fault.  All on the "five", often with a plus.  And I, like any AU student, have a lot of stories about classmates who are 33 years old and are married, and on the last Mercs, and with their business.  ‚ÄúHare whining, it's time to figure out what, in fact, is happening like this?‚Äù - one day, this thought was firmly stuck in my head.  And here it is, debriefing - for us, excellent students, for the future generation and for parents who ‚Äúpull‚Äù their children from the top five to the top five. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/805/f24/af1/805f24af10f24e00e946193398033f2a.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  School time is wonderful </h2><br>  As a rule, the story begins with school.  It is in it that we familiarize ourselves with the evaluation system of our efforts on a five-point scale.  And it is precisely in it that the expectations of relatives, friends, acquaintances and teachers and the division into losers, troechniki, horoshist and honors begin.  The first social castes, the first social roles, privileges, etc.  So, the student showed himself as a diligent and capable student and got into the list of potential honors pupils.  So far, this is junior Vasya or a sweet second grader Ira, but the problems are already there.  The mechanism is running. <br><br><ul><li>  The requirements for a successful and intelligent student increase, now he must understand the material unconditionally.  Any failure is condemned and criticized. <br></li><li>  Gradually, the child (teenager) begins to be afraid of mistakes and looks for ways to avoid them.  At best, he begins to cram material without much thought, and at worst, he begins to avoid difficult tasks and tasks so as not to stumble on them. <br></li><li>  Often teachers impose restrictions from the category: ‚Äúeveryone needs exercise 562 for 5, and honors pupils need two with an asterisk‚Äù.  At the same time, it is not uncommon (that to lie - in 99% of cases) the teachers do not bother to explain the in-depth material, but they are laying on parents and tutors (as Vasya did not solve the problem with **, urgently pull up!). <br></li><li>  Schoolchildren-excellent students have nothing left but to learn: the skates rust and become small, the sport is abandoned, friends are forgotten.  In the summer - a thick list of books and a bunch of "tails" and preparing for a new school year.  Social ties are torn, a person breaks away from society at the most inappropriate period of becoming a person. <br></li><li>  Some high achievers adapt and start begging for marks, explaining that this five is just not enough - the rest are all in place.  It is clear that from this point the decline in the quality of knowledge also begins. <br></li><li>  The exaggerated demands of all parties to the educational process plunge the student into continuous stress, which no one thinks of fighting.  Appear early depression, psychological and nervous disorders, exacerbated chronicle, reduced immunity.  A schoolboy, especially a high school student, may just get sick. <br></li></ul><br>  In my case, there was a terrible breakdown.  In the 8th and 9th grades, the coils flew off, and I began to learn much worse, to make trouble, to tear down my lessons, to fight and to ignore everything that I didn‚Äôt like: history, literature and other foreign countries and aesthetics (yes, yes, I, techie, territorial proximity fell into the most humanitarian gymnasium of the city).  Parents rectified the situation as best they could, until another series of competitions started - in Russian, literature, physics, biology were first places at the district level and prizes at the regional and All-Russian levels.  And no one wondered how this is so: for the control troika, and at the Olympiad - first place?  And the answer was found quite recently - it was scary at the control, but not at the Olympiad.  Therefore, calories appeared on double sheets of paper, not translated into joules, laboratory tests with silly errors, extraneous roots of equations, etc., not excluded.

    <h2>  Institute of </h2><br>  No, not a university, not an academy, not a university, but ‚Äúwe go to college‚Äù - of course, at the request of parents and because ‚Äúbeing a lawyer‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing an economist‚Äù is cool.  To the previous problems are added new, university, related to adult life and already with work. <br><br>  <b>An excellent student often cannot work and gain practical experience</b> , because it is very difficult to find a balance between work and a brilliant study.  As a result, at the first interview, the experience and communication skills of the average student easily beat the pathetic red diploma.  But, by the way, not always.  For example, in my region, a vacancy of one large food factory often emerges with the obligatory demand of a gold medal and a red diploma.  It emerges with an enviable frequency - apparently, not very good students of school cope with milk rivers.  But in general, companies, especially in the IT field, want to see experience, skills and specific skills. <br><br>  <b>Since, alas, teachers of the old formation still prevail in universities, the recipe for winning excellent marks comes down to memorizing and assimilating the theory.</b>  In my practice, the theory of Java and the theory of C ++ were particularly excellent at an additional higher level.  Guess who in the group writes to them?  No one.  Accordingly, it takes almost all the time not to master and put into practice, but to scoop the material and please the teacher.  A particularly sophisticated clinic is the availability of a textbook or training manual written by your teacher.  For example, at my first graduate in 2006, marketing was taught by the 1997 manual.  So it is not surprising that in Russia this matter is so bad. <br><br>  In order to earn an increased scholarship, a student not only studies, but also begins to engage in all extracurricular activities at a university in a row, spending even more time.  But, by the way, this is not so bad - part of the communication skills and social connections can be restored. <br><br>  You can shoot me, but I am convinced that the university is not the place to put life on a red diploma.  Here it is: either it turns out, or it is better to combine it with practice and to have experience.  Moreover, the theory lends itself more smoothly to practical yeast - so look for an internship, mentor, stick to them, look out for and understand what you need from theory, and what economic theory, sociology and history can push in favor of really applicable knowledge. <br><br><h2>  Work, we are with you for life </h2><br>  And so the work begins, where the excellent student syndrome flourished and matured over the previous 15‚Äì17 years in its entire clinical picture and takes the form of pathology rather than sweet endeavors.  The employer, who hired a graduate with an average grade of 5.0, after some time finds a nightmarish and unexpected metamorphosis. <br><br>  <b>An excellent student spends a lot more time at work</b> , because he strives to do perfectly (in his understanding) all the work, loses a sense of priority and eventually buries himself in the little things.  For example, it may be two days to create a congratulatory letter for customers, while forgetting about the direct responsibility to promote or sell. <br><br>  <b>An excellent student is not ready to tolerate any criticism</b> - and this is not because he considers himself an infallible genius, but because he is not confident and painfully perceives criticism as a reproach and collapse of his ideal world.  Reacting to criticism sharply negatively, he gets problems in relations with management and colleagues, his career begins to stall.  And yesterday's even an excellent student with pink cheeks becomes a gloomy and pounded worker. <br><br>  <b>An excellent student again decides to avoid mistakes and refuses difficult work</b> , moving along the path of least resistance and refusing decisions that are valuable for experience. <br><br>  Finally, the <b>high achiever begins to break</b> and comprehend the working questions by leaps and bounds, strives for growth and, on the one hand, becomes an enemy to colleagues, on the other, burns out from constant hard work for five plus. <br><blockquote>  <i>My experience.</i>  <i>In the company where I got a job as a testing engineer, there was an excellent practice - training + mentoring.</i>  <i>I came across a brilliant practitioner mentor, and the boss was also an excellent pupil.</i>  <i>I was able to quickly see the difference and understand that being a cool pro is much better than filigree making out minor bugs in Bagizill.</i>  <i>And then it was possible to overcome the main thing - to stop turning learning into a record in the notebooks of definitions of the trunk, numbering plan, perimeter, radius, NAT, and call patterns.</i>  <i>We had to take and see with our eyes what it is, how the database is replicated, how the stand falls, how the OKS-7 is capricious, and Cisco is creepyly tuned - not at all like in a colorful presentation.</i>  <i>Having completed the training earlier than expected, I drove into work perfectly and began to learn to fight with the developers and be a professional.</i>  <i>It was a cool, valuable experience.</i> </blockquote>  But if you have now decided that an excellent student = loser, then you are deeply wrong.  We still watched him, but what about those who did not study very much?  I have often observed how people write ‚Äúmalako‚Äù and ‚Äúrisen‚Äù, they do not know what Senatskaya Square is and easily confuse factorial with a fractal, but at the same time they occupy leadership positions, are project managers only because they have learned to survive and achieve results with the help of flattery, grease and twisting.  They are confident and ready to move forward, not much bothering about skills - if only because they know that they will not be good specialists, and therefore they need to get up, surround themselves with the same weak guys and somehow conduct business.  They are not afraid.  And an excellent student?  He is afraid to make a mistake and demonstrates his success in order to somehow survive in the corporate world.  Of course, colleagues are weaker seeking to eliminate it. <blockquote>  <i>Three years later, when I became the head of the department, I had a subordinate, a 38-year-old woman, a round student who constantly talked about her school and university.</i>  <i>She worked ‚Äúfrom these to these‚Äù and was afraid to be creative, because ‚Äúthis is impossible, this is not the case.‚Äù</i>  <i>Once she wrote a newsletter for foreign colleagues - dry and damn verified.</i>  <i>Perfectionism in its purest form.</i>  <i>I praised her style and language, noted the seriousness and depth.</i>  <i>After 40 minutes, she brought 4 versions of the same text, creative and even cooler.</i>  <i>She just needed to be believed and signaled to her that she was good.</i>  <i>Since then, it has been the best of colleagues.</i> </blockquote>  Of course, the whole situation is marked too vividly, and there are many worthy guys among all - first of all, because the majority understand that everything around is people and you need to do well what you are capable of.  I know yesterday's troechnik and horoshist, and today brilliant restaurateurs, builders, engineers, programmers, managers, and I know yesterday's excellent students, and today sellers in Eldorado and in KFC.  And I know those who carried their way to the end: excellent study, Ph.D., brilliant work, doctoral. <br><br>  But in general, I want my life not to be killed at school, so that social connections and friendships are not lost behind it.  And employers, especially first graduates, I want to ask about adaptation.  Brilliant employees grow from yesterday's excellent students if they manage to integrate them into the business correctly.  Here are some secrets for dealing with such guys. <br><br><ul><li>  Prioritize and tell which tasks are more important and which can be considered as auxiliary ones. <br></li><li>  Explain that in the work the licked plates and the code of the Christmas tree are not so important (it is important! Always follow the code style!), How important is the achievable and desired result. <br></li><li>  Tell about the principles of the business, about the absence of the need to theorize everything around and accurately record everything in a notebook in a notebook. <br></li><li>  To praise for achievements and to criticize, explaining that criticism is not swearing, but learning, mastering new experience and new knowledge. <br></li><li>  Take care of employee socialization, pay attention to his positioning in the team, strive to make him not a separate white crow, but part of a friendly and welcoming team. <br></li><li>  To show that there is life beyond the framework of the State Standards and SNiPs, that it is possible to develop an idea and propose a new one, not to be afraid to create something that tomorrow will become a new standard.  There are brains for this, but, as the hero of ‚ÄúWinter Evening in Gagra‚Äù said, there is not enough courage. <br></li></ul><br>  Of course, even without these simple rules, an intelligent person masters and understands both friendly and hostile moments, gets involved in the work and begins to plow to the envy of everyone.  But this is a huge, tremendous time.  By the way, a huge plus of excellent students is that they study easily and skillfully, many people like to study and continue their continuing education on their own.  A competent employer will definitely find a way to wrap it in their favor.  The main thing is not to turn away, and reach out. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345998/</a></p>
