I will say right away that I did not achieve phenomenal success in building a relief body, did not achieve world records and was not listed in the Guinness Book of Records. <br><br>  This article is an attempt to summarize, share and discuss with friends in misfortune the information accumulated during 3 years of training. <br><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  The issue of maintaining one's own physical form has become acute after entering the university.  Before that, I didn‚Äôt play sports as such (with the exception of chess in the 5th grade, half-year karate-do and physical education at school).  After the first semester of active study and putting the lab, an unfriendly attitude to physical education and cheerful drinking of beer, I began to notice that I was slowly starting to lose shape and become fat.  Began to think about how to comprehensively address the current problem.  Resolutely and cheerfully he studied numerous websites and manuals for young strokes and confidently walked into the hall (since he was free).  Naturally, without a coach, and naturally, without any system, he began to carry everything that came to hand.  With a different number of approaches and exercises in them.  Naturally, my desperate attempts did not yield the expected effect.  Then I went back into literature and began to discover new horizons for myself. <br>  I think you should not describe all my attempts to reach heights, because it will take too much of my time and you.  I will try to briefly tell you what I have learned for myself from all this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  So: </h4><br>  <b>1.

      I wrote the power supply first, because I believe that the success of your undertakings by 50% (and maybe more) depends on it.  Given that the audience in Habr√©, for the most part, is a busy youth, this issue takes on an additional shade.  You must admit that often you do not have time to have breakfast properly (because you run to work or to college), corporate lunch is not in all companies, and dinner falls on a late evening after standing for hours in traffic jams of the megalopolis.  In this case, you rarely think about how and what you eat, and counting calories, consider the lot models or unsuccessfully losing weight women.  Before describing the main aspects of proper nutrition, it is necessary to mention three common types of male figures: endomorphs, ectomorphs and mesomorphs.  In any person, one type always prevails.  Depending on this, you should vary the load and power. <br><br>  " <b>Ectomorph.</b> Narrow bone, low level of subcutaneous fat and muscle mass. Volumes and muscle mass are gained with difficulty. A 100% ectomorph is a tall, thin man with an elongated face, high forehead, narrow chest and abdomen, long slender arms and legs. Subcutaneous fat layer is almost absent, muscles are not developed or poorly developed. <br><br>  <b>Mesomorph.</b>  Genetically gifted type, the best result for bodybuilding.  A typical mesomorph is characterized by the predominance of bones and muscles.  He has broad shoulders and chest, muscular arms and legs.  The amount of subcutaneous fat in the mesomorph is minimal.  Long torso, voluminous chest, a good ratio of shoulder width and waist. <br><br>  <b>Endomorph.</b>  Large bone cobalt structure.  A clean endomorph, as a rule, has a round head, a large belly and a large amount of subcutaneous fat, especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hips and shoulders.  At the same time he has thin wrists and ankles, weak arms and legs.  Weight gain will not be a problem, but it is very difficult to burn fat.  Prone to fat accumulation.  Needs frequent aerobic training. "(C) <br><br>  I assume that you mentally correlated yourself with any of the groups.  If it is brief and more clear: an ectomorph is a person with the fastest metabolism, an endomorph is with the slowest, a mesomorph is something in the middle.  Accordingly, if the first one can eat almost any time of the day any food and it will not gain weight, then the latter should be very careful in the selection of food and the correct schedule for its reception. <br><br>  Highlights: <br>  1.1 fruits should be eaten half an hour before meals, and not after.  since they are digested faster than meat and potatoes, then if you eat something heavy at first, they will simply ‚Äúrotten‚Äù from above.  If you eat them before meals, they will have time to digest and the vitamins will digest more successfully. <br>  1.2 it is not recommended to combine carbohydrates with fat and protein foods.  think a few times before eating pasta with meatballs, meat and potatoes, or bread and cheese.  If you are surprised by this, I advise you to read about <a href="http://www.missfit.ru/food/separate/">separate feeding.</a> <br>  1.3 it is not recommended to eat fried foods.  better boiled, and even better soaring. <br>  1.4 limit carbohydrate intake overnight.  (for example, do not gorge on bedtime with sweet fruit or chocolate).  Surprised?  I advise you to read about the <a href="http://muscle-food.com.ua/stati-o-sportivnom-pitanii-i-bodibildinge/belki-zhiry-uglevody-i-ih-rol-v-sportivnom-pitanii.html">metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins in the human body</a> .  In short: carbohydrates are converted into fats, but proteins are not. <br>  1.5 completely exclude ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù, fast food and sweet soda.  I don't need to explain this <br>  1.6 eat many times, but a little bit.  It is not recommended to eat 2 times, but in large quantities (many can eat in the morning and after working with beer in the evening) <br>  1.7 the dangers of alcohol should also be mentioned <br>  1.8 when playing sports do not limit yourself to drinking, but at night, again, it is better not to drink juices in large quantities <br><br>  <b>2. Types of load</b> <br>  For myself (to make it easier for me) I divide them into 2 categories: aerobic and strength. <br><br>  Depending on your body type and your preferred results, you should select one or another group. <br>  By aerobic, I carry: running, swimming, skiing, biking, etc. <br>  power: powerlifting, bodybuilding <br><br>  Since the task for me was to preserve my form, dry and grow relief, I stopped practicing in the hall and started running (and later going to the pool).  I started from three kilometers in the park and gradually climbed to 11 in 3 years (running time ~ hour).  After running, I go to the horizontal bars and do several approaches in the pull-ups (with different hooks) and shake the press (wall bars).  Before or after running, I additionally work out the press with the help of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-HO2LDmB0E0">this</a> complex (I started from the suggested amount of time for each of the approaches, at the moment I am doing 2 times more).  I run including in the winter (if the temperature does not fall below -10).  I strongly advise you not to run for a while.  Run at a medium-slow pace.  This will contribute to dropping excess weight (I read somewhere that the average person's fats begin to burn after 30 minutes of continuous running, because the first time carbohydrates are consumed - they are the fastest substances in our body, the fats are stored stock).  If you feel that you are tired - better skip one lesson, do not force the body.  Only you must understand that fatigue is not a can of beer in the refrigerator before a football match of your favorite team.  Over time, you will find your pace and you will become addicted.  Without constant physical exertion you will feel broken and weak. <br><br>  For those who are going to enroll in the gym, you need to remember that a large number of repetitions with small weights will contribute to the appearance of relief, and the lifting of large loads - muscle growth.  In any case, I recommend to go through a consultation with a trainer.  He will give you a training program (complex for hands on Mondays, on Wednesday chest, on Friday legs), and he will tell you with a diet for your body.  It is better not to save on this.  Especially the first time.  Working with large loads is dangerous for a beginner athlete.  You can seriously plant a heart. <br><br>  <b>3. Equipment</b> <br>  Since most fleeing people live in cities, they often run on asphalt.  If you do not fork out and do not buy special running shoes (for example, <a href="http://www.onlineshoes.com/mens-asics-gel-equation-3-white-black-red-p_id149880">this one</a> ), then very soon your joints will become unusable.  By the way, there is an interesting <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike%252BiPod">thing</a> for geeks. <br>  In order to do aerobatics on the horizontal bar, you may need gloves to keep your hands. <br>  Well, for me personally, it is much more convenient to run with a pre-made playlist in the player or a list of podcasts, although at first you needed a partner to keep up the pace. <br><br>  Perhaps all.  Hope you found something new for yourself in this article.  Good luck and good health! <br><br>  Body Types: <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Wikipedia</a> <br>  <a href="http://loyd.com.ua/articles/item-3993.html">Loyd</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99447/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99447/</a></p>
