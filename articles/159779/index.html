Today it's time to talk about another device that combines elements of the two previous ones - <b><a href="http://www.nokia.com/ru-ru/products/accessory/md-100w/%3Fcid%3Dncomprod-fw-scl-na-habrlink_0x0-md100wpost-othsocmedia-ru-ru-1todtmt7acd4a">JBL PowerUp</a></b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f44/fa8/6e2/f44fa86e2aece62c64363515f76c2478.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc4/cf0/75a/cc4cf075adb95e87cc93404f41005551.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Contents of delivery: </h4><br>  The kit includes the speaker itself, an audio cable for connecting devices that do not have Bluetooth, a network adapter, and instructions.

      Everything is packed very tightly, it does not hang out in a box, the power supply adapter, the instruction manual and the audio cable are packed in a separate small box of cardboard, the column is wrapped in a protective film.  The box with the periphery and the column are already in the corrugated cardboard box.  The entire set is placed in the final packaging, colorfully designed and bearing the JBL and Nokia logos. <br><br>  We had a unpacked device on the test, there is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DN8wiMYh99p4">video unpacking here</a> . <br><br>  The kit does not include a speaker cable for connecting a computer to a software update, but a standard micro USB USB cable, such as the one supplied with your Lumia 920, can handle it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e09/c27/901/e09c27901b575b01a15e2a180cac0cfa.jpg"><br>  <i>Delivery set - a column, SZU, audio</i> . <br><br><h4>  Appearance, materials: </h4><br><br>  The column itself has a rounded design, made of matte plastic, the color options are blue, black and white. <br><br>  The front panel is almost completely covered with a protective net, in the center of which there is only a Bluetooth activation button and an LED indicator of its operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2bb/1ae/ede/2bb1aeededbf2b6a43acadb1015ed0f9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3c/c57/11e/b3cc5711ed3e29cbaaed2a95122c0135.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo front panel off and on.</i> <br><br>  On the rear panel are located: the power button of the device, a connector for connecting a network adapter, a micro-USB connector and a line input for connecting any audio devices using an audio cable.  Even on the back panel, we see two phase inverters that provide deep bass sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ee/36d/1f7/4ee36d1f7d72e13c4b815e09f44f0389.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo connectors on the back</i> <br><br>  The most interesting is on the top panel of the device (and under it). <br><br>  At the front edge of the top panel are the main controls of our column, they are assembled into a single panel with touch keys, which are illuminated by LEDs.  In the middle of the control panel is placed the NFC logo with the corresponding chip under it.  In the center of the upper part there is a circle with Nokia logo inscribed in it, the circle itself is made of rubberized plastic and slightly protrudes above the surface of the panel.  This circle allows the phone to be placed securely on the column without slipping. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fcc/cc5/2c0/fcccc52c0cb1d1e80a639f88e7126ae4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/159/81c/1a8/15981c1a8925bbef9c25464039d617db.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a04/fe7/3ae/a04fe73aed5375d178fdd9f207345fd7.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo of the column from the top entirely, control panel, platform with charging panel.</i> <br><br>  The weight of the column is just over 1.5 kg.  The device is equipped with rubberized feet to prevent slipping. <br><br><h4>  The work of the column and charging, the internal device </h4><br>  So, we come to the most interesting - the use of JBL PowerUp. <br>  Among other things, it is equipped with a wireless charger, created according to the Qi standard.  It is located in the center of the top panel, under the Nokia logo. <br><br>  Working with the column is as simple and comfortable as possible.  To pair the phone with a speaker, just hold the phone in the middle of the control panel and touch the NFC logo.  A pop-up notification will appear on the phone about connecting to JBL PowerUp and activating Bluetooth to stream audio.  The user simply accepts the invitation, the phone will automatically turn on Bluetooth and connect to the column.  No need to enter PIN codes and turn on Bluetooth independently, as was previously required.  Now you just have to turn on the music in your phone - and it will start playing in the column.  The whole procedure takes exactly 5 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f8c/962/201/f8c962201b33123f11325c91a21b66bb.jpg"><br><br>  When you put the phone on the speaker, the LED frame on it lights up, the backlight flashes for a while after the charging is activated.  It looks quite unusual, a sort of landing lights for the space shuttle. <br>  In addition, the touch control panel has a built-in proximity sensor, which allows it to activate the LED backlight when a hand approaches.  Thanks to it it is possible to operate a column easily even in the dark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9be/be9/028/9bebe902887ce0cfb3c6bae8988256e0.jpg"><br><br>  You can adjust the volume using either the hardware keys of the phone or the touch keys on the speaker itself.  Wireless sound transmission is carried out using the apt-X codec.  The sound is deep, clear bass, the volume is enough to accommodate 40-50 square meters.  m. The range is from 65 Hz to 20 kHz with a maximum volume of 94 dB.  The maximum range of the Bluetooth module for this model is 10 m, however, the signal passes through the walls and ceilings without any problems. <br><br>  In all likelihood, the speaker is more suitable for playing dance music, it is quite capable of filling your apartment with sound enough to arrange a disco for friends.  It also copes well with the rock repertoire, which is famous for its abundance of low frequencies.  Just do not overdo it with the volume and watch the time, otherwise the neighbors may be angry with you.  :) <br><br>  Devices are interfaced, music plays, and you can freely move around the room, office, garage and so on.  But it is not a secret to anyone that wireless communication is quite energy intensive.  And we come to another "chip" of this device - the function of wireless charging.  Simply put the phone on the top panel of the speaker and it starts charging.  The range of the charging panel is 15 mm.  Thus, when playing music through JBL PowerUp, there is no need to additionally connect the phone to the charger or choose between music and battery life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8dd/524/44c/8dd52444cf42f0cb31c77ddd4ed5b8ef.jpg"><br>  <i>Phone is charging</i> <br><br>  To use all the functions of the speaker with the Lumia 820, it will be necessary to purchase an additional replaceable case for it with induction charging support, the Lumia 920 can be charged from the ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù column. <br>  Moreover, since JBL PowerUp is built on the Qi industry standard, it can charge all devices supporting it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4zx2xy6VjE&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhheuO6q3ibJPfs3nzFEENwU17V7pg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Device video</i> <br><br>  The Bluetooth module supports the remote control profile of audio and video equipment (AVRCP) 1.4, which allows you to control the speaker directly from a compatible device.  And thanks to the advanced audio distribution profile (A2DP) 1.2, the device can work with the widest range of phones and smartphones, and not only with Lumia. <br><br><h4>  Let's summarize a little: </h4><br>  Column looks nice, pleasing to the eye and goes well with phones line Lumia.  Connects easily to NFC-enabled phones.  The speaker not only plays music without wires, but also charges phones with induction charging support according to the Qi industry standard.  At the same time it is able to work both with devices simply via Bluetooth, and with the help of an audio cable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159779/</a></p>
