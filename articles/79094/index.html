  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The tale of Petya and Vasya or again about the pros and cons of freelancing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In one metropolis, in the neighboring houses live two friends - Peter and Vasya.  Both are programmers, but Petya works in the company's office, and Vasya freelance. <br>  On Monday, as always, Petya got up at 6-30 am to be in time for 9 to work in the city center.  He really wanted to sleep, last night he and Vasya drank beer late, but were fined for being late at work.  In 8-55, making his way through the drifts and traffic jams, angry and sleepless Peter resorted to the office.  Vasya is only awakening at this time.  Exactly in 10 minutes he will rise and in 7 seconds will reach his workplace.  Petya is jealous - he spends on the road from 1 to 2 hours and the same amount back. <br><br>  While Vasya, yawning, is looking through the mail, his boss is yelling at Petya.  Colleague Natasha smiles wickedly.  Petya again envies a friend - Vasya does not have a fool-boss, abusive colleagues and stupid corporate rules. <br>  At 12, Petya unexpectedly turned off the monitor.  He sent a request to the system administrator and went to lunch.  When he returned - everything worked.  Around the same time, the monitor went out and Vasya.  He tried to fix it himself, but could not.  He called Peter for consultation, but Peter did not help, saying that he had the same problem, but the sysadmin decided it.  Vasya had to carry the monitor to the workshop and pay the master for repair. <br><br>  On Tuesday, Petya quickly completed his current work and played online chess with Vasya for half a day.  While Petya was playing, his salary continued to accrue.  Vasya after chess sat down to write the code.  Vasya receives money for real work, and not for working hours from 9 to 18. <br>  In the evening, friends went to the bar.  They drank a bottle of beer and ... the mood improved.  Went an exciting conversation about women.  But then a client called Vasya on a cell phone and said that his site had fallen.  Vasya was a responsible freelancer, so he began to consult the client long and tediously.  Friends of the conversation unceremoniously interrupted and ... the mood deteriorated.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On Wednesday, Petya and Vasya became very sick, as they had a cold beer in the evening of the previous day.  Petya took paid sick leave, while Vasya was sick at his own expense.  His colleague Vova worked for Petya, and there was no one for Vasya to work.  He broke the deadlines of the project and did not pay him money.  Vasya was lying under a duvet, he was sad and jealous of Pete. <br>  By Saturday, friends recovered.  Petya called Vasya to go bowling - drink beer, roll the balls.  Vasya really wanted to go, he hadn‚Äôt rolled balls for so long.  But he was a disciplined freelancer, so he said: Sorry, friend, I can not.  It is necessary to work, make up for the time that I was sick.  Yes, and I have no money. <br>  Petya was upset and called Vova to his colleague in bowling. <br><br>  Next week, Petya's company was corporate.  He had a lot of fun and even established a relationship with her pretty colleague Natasha, with whom they danced and kissed in the lobby of the restaurant.  Vasya worked all week without getting out of the computer.  He made up for what he had lost during his illness and wanted to earn more on vacation.  Vasya was overgrown with stubble, did not communicate with anyone, did not meet with girls, and was angry about trifles. <br><br>  Two weeks later, Petya was sent to a conference of programmers in St. Petersburg.  At the expense of the company, of course.  It was interesting, Petya learned a lot of new things.  At that time, Vasya was still earning a vacation and was jealous of his friend. <br><br>  Finally it's time to leave.  Petya and Vasya went to Egypt together to relax.  While Petya was lying on the beach, Vasya consulted by telephone his client, whose site had suddenly dropped.  Vacation flew quickly, friends had a good rest and returned to their native Megapolis. <br>  Four days later, Petya received another salary and printed vacation photos for his grandmother, who lives in the village.  Vasina's grandmother received pictures from her grandson only a month later, because Vasya did not have money to print - he spent everything in Egypt.  And Peter spent his vacation there. <br><br>  A year later, Petya was promoted to head of a department, two to head of a department.  Now Petya himself is not kodit, he is in charge.  And Vasya all the code on the freelance itself. <br>  Now friends do not rest together.  Petya goes to the Seychelles with Natasha, and Vasya, as before, spends his vacation in Egypt. <br><br>  The moral of this tale is: both in freelancing and in office work there are pros and cons. <br><br>  Other tales were in our <a href="http://blog.magwai.ru/">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79094/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79094/</a></p>
