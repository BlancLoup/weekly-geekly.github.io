  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pro gamedev from the desktop exhibition</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to show you some interesting pieces from the Spiel exhibition in Essen.  This is the largest exhibition of board games in the world (comparable to Gencon in the USA), where everyone who has at least some relation to the tabletops comes to.  We go there for 10 years in a row, scare people and shoot samples. <br><br>  Interestingly, many <b>hybrid games have</b> come this year.  That is, those where IT is very tightly intersected with the physical world.  Here, for example, just tryndets fun game "Soviet cuisine" from a European publisher: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w5/vp/gu/w5vpguedycox3y8qa4t0dhy-xfm.jpeg">

      The plot is as follows.  After World War II there was nothing to eat, and Stalin ordered to cook from everything in a row.  You take vodka, nuclear waste, boots from a corpse and bagels, mix in a meat grinder.  If you get the right color - get points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ml/jy/4u/mljy4uhqpflbiwaopqh4u0hw_x8.jpeg"><br><br>  For rather obvious reasons, we did not take a license for the game.  But apart from the characteristics of the setting, it is precisely the mechanics to madness that is beautiful. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It works like this: you put the application on the phone.  It activates the camera.  Bring to it a recipe card.  A QR code is woven into the pattern on the shirt.  The camera reads the shirt and the application knows what color you want to get. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j4/47/6n/j4476n-wwzcrfbojbcjnhttydvw.jpeg"><br><br>  Then you choose from the table a card of the ingredients of your future dish.  The task is to get the same brown.  You show four cards in turn to the application, it reads their shirts very quickly and shows the grind animation in the meat grinder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ii/ss/tw/iisstwn68yvexyujsvc9fns1cn8.jpeg"><br><br>  Then from the meat grinder beats the fountain of the desired color.  And points are given for similarity. <br><br>  The application is very organically entered into the game.  Very responsive, you don‚Äôt have to touch the phone, full Squarewell in the interface and actions of the players.  You just take the cards and throw in the meat grinder.  Very cool, but the model is sensitive to the performance of the phone, the quality of the picture from the camera and the lighting.  Owners of economy phones will already feel the brakes in the desktop.  But I must say that I tested beta. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sp/gq/7f/spgq7fnbw7sugypimqmfyudsdgc.jpeg"><br><br>  If the phone or tablet is fast, then a new level is opened.  This is one of the first cases when so cool is done, and when using the phone does not interfere with the game.  It turns out that the main thing is the HCI model, and not the very presence of the phone on the table. <br><br>  Another smartphone on the table means no need to read the rules.  He and the video can show, and say what to do right now on the situation.  In this game, you first launch the application, and then it tells you how many cards to distribute and what to do.  The first launch is detailed (‚ÄúYou can talk about your cards about anything, but don‚Äôt show them, the task is to put only the right things in the meat grinder, comrades!‚Äù), For the second time already briefly (‚ÄúTo the words, yes. To show the cards ‚Äî no!‚Äù).  Then without modal windows at all. <br><br>  This is also background music for the atmosphere.  And single player mode.  And save the game for full campaigns.  In general, really cool work. <br><br>  We would gladly bring it if it were not for the setting, of course. <br><br><h2>  AR / VR </h2><br>  The second story of hybrid games is when one person somehow specifically sticks, and the others at the table help him.  It began along the line of virtual reality, when one player puts a <s>packet</s> on the head with a phone and tells what he sees there.  We have now taken a license for a kind of escape-rooms in virtuality.  In the first story you need to get out of the helicopter stuck in the trees after the fall (you have a connection with the control room), in the second - from the submarine.  It's cool to be dispatchers and solve different riddles.  For example, advise what to pull on the dashboard on the phone.  Very reminiscent of the work in the second line of support, only the user really wants to save. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hq/xu/yl/hqxuylsqfrfrm_5t6qe2tqu0o3k.jpeg"><br><br>  Here are the screenshots: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0x/j-/vm/0xj-vmjcluuzvgi6zt0qbb5qzoq.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xk/qm/oi/xkqmoiqhudtfdbpp8fgz92-inga.jpeg"><br><br>  The first games will be released around January-February. <br><br><h2>  Database analysis </h2><br>  Another interesting development branch of these games is when someone has a tablet with a database, and the rest play detective.  In the tablet, you can drive the evidence, there you can watch fingerprints, there you can assign tasks to the laboratory or assistants (they take time), and you can think about something else at this time.  While the first versions of these pieces are just coming out, it is difficult to say something definite. <br><br>  <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/223321/detective-modern-crime-board-game">Here is a simple example</a> . <br><br>  Here is an example more complicated: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ErrsyyCk_E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Sensor miniaturization </h2><br>  And now the physical components are at a new level.  Here is a tower in which every detail has an NFC tag, and the base of the tower serves as a field generator.  That is, the game itself can understand what was put and how - and from this to display events on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uy/ye/cj/uyyecj17y_ymkzdfmbgj1g2_e9y.jpeg"><br><br>  This is incredibly cool technology for kids, but for now the games are expensive.  So we counted last year - it is 4,500 rubles on the shelf.  We decided not to take it. <br><br><h2>  More game examples </h2><br>  Here is the periscope in the tablet or on the screen, a good field of the boat itself.  I'm not sure that it will take off, the process is not much more interesting than playing a computer game.  But it will give some development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vg/ll/gn/vgllgn4srcofeqw845jzo6anlvk.jpeg"><br><br>  But, of course, for the time being, all this is hardly crossed.  Almost all of them have a strained IT part, because publishers either know how to do desktops well and try themselves in the wondrous new world of computer technology, or they are trying to shift the app in the form of a desk, and it turns out to be a good one. <br><br>  There is another branch of the use of IT - design.  For example, the box of Exploding Seals meows every time you open it.  Simple and cool, the usual light sensor, which is connected to the speaker.  If I am not mistaken, he adds 50-60 rubles to the price on the shelf; we tried to make such a batch for the Space Alert game boxes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/988/c2a/487/988c2a487c9946ce8185e7d803ce6004.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Chip KO83</sup> <br><br>  Well, and this, of course, on many mechanics, applications come out on the table.  And this is not a hybrid, and omnikanal.  It is a normal development, because the main thing in the game is awesome mechanics.  Just the mechanics of our physical world are very decorated with components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sm/uk/4z/smuk4znderili6y5uwcln2ef_jw.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Although here it is difficult to transfer</sup> <br><br>  In general, it is quite interesting to observe how technology gradually turns into magic.  Because we know how the same NFC tower works, but for children it is already natural and completely ordinary. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430960/</a></p>
