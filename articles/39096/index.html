  <section class="page js-page"><h1>One wire</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>Written a year ago, the post is morally obsolete =)</em> <br>  Not so long ago, I thought about the development of the computer industry and history. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once upon a time (what the ‚Äúolder generation‚Äù likes to recall) computers occupied a room or even a hall.  Only one person had access to it.  Then a few people - terminal computers. <br>  History decided that it was necessary to take the path of reducing the computer in size and placing it in each person.  Yes, the servers are now very large, very powerful, but ... it's not that. <br>  The same History sometimes does wonderful things, maybe in the future we will return to the computer-rooms that serve us directly? .. If it is not clear, now I will explain. <br><br>  Thought pushed Last.fm.  Let's say, why do I need many and many gigabytes (which Gpcode.ak devoured music a month ago) if they are on servers and at any moment I can listen to what I like.  Now it only stops Internet speed / traffic or lack of the Last.fm library (or similar sites).  The latter refers to the holivar issue of copyright and other issues, but more on that later. <br><br>  First of all, you need to wait for an inexpensive high-speed Internet.  In the capital, unlimited tariffs are not as expensive as in the provinces, in our city in general the concept of ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù was widely manifested about a year ago.  We have to dream about lower prices and higher speeds, but some steps have already been taken, it pleases.  Well, in the rainbow wireless perspective, there is a very high-speed surf.

      Imagine your computer with these options: ‚ÄúRAM - |  +?  There was money, I paid for the click on the "plus" - and now you have grown gigabytes of memory.  Something like a virtual machine.  No analysis of the proposal in local shops, you already made them some time ago.  So it is with vidyahoy, percents and other things.  Like this?  Like this: somewhere in the city there is a big building.  In it a certain increased similarity of a sistemnik.  ‚ÄúRoom-operative‚Äù, ‚ÄúRoom-video‚Äù, ‚ÄúRoom-percent‚Äù.  And you have nothing at home.  The same hose connects you to this building as it now connects you to an Internet provider.  At home there is only a monitor (touch, of course, this is the future), and this wire comes to it.  Or does not come, everything is organized without wires - not the essence. <br><br>  How many interesting things are revealed are hard for me to describe.  Firstly, in terms of information transfer.  Why should I download a movie or music from someone if we have a common screw with him?  If, roughly speaking, we all have one common screw in the city.  And between the cities the exchange of info takes place every week, which is formed according to wiki principles. <br>  Secondly, do you use all the power of this or that component of the system unit?  And here you have statistics for the month and an offer to put the parameters that you personally need.  Saving is the same!  By the way, nothing will change for manufacturers - users have a choice in the preferences of one or another company. <br><br>  About the payment?  Yes, all the same, the connection and subscriber.  How much does it cost to update a home computer every time?  Well, for whom, as well, it‚Äôs okay.  And then I paid for the addon and that's it. <br>  Where will the money go?  For service.  There will be no queues at the service centers.  Everything is getting better in the Server. <br><br>  And to the word about copyright.  You have to pay for listening to music, watching movies and using programs.  But pay a penny.  For everyone will listen / watch / use, everyone will pay.  From this is going to a decent amount.  The incentive for developers and beginners is huge.  But ... the Windows are always licensed, and the linux with the latest firewood already installed.  Well or not - for lovers of tambourines.  Music is also a license with a huge bit rate ... <br><br>  In general, in essence (if I am difficult to explain): there are servers somewhere.  They are all common.  By your order and whim you issued such a computer.  You are connected with one wire to the monitor, and at home you only have a monitor. <br>  I'm afraid to fantasize further, but the advantages, in my opinion, are obvious.  Minus one big - you have to redo the already established whole system.  But ... maybe it's worth it, but start small.  In my opinion, now everything is realizable. <br><br>  I am waiting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39096/</a></p>
