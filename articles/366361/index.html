And order.  The order around means the order in the head.  It's nice to be clean when everything is sparkling and pleasing to the eye.  But the trouble is - I do not like to clean. <br>  The robots-vacuum cleaners have already come to the aid of the geeks - but they can only sweep the floor, and all other surfaces have to be cleaned on their own. <br><br>  The most difficult cleaning is washing windows.  I remember how in the USSR, in the absence of microfiber and muscle masters, crumpled newspapers were used for this.  It's amazing why only then the newspapers were not used - and the wallpaper was glued on, and, if need be, gone.  And some even read them.

      And now, it would seem, progress, the 21st century, cleaning products, magic napkins, telescopic brushes.  And still, washing the windows is such a bother ... Everywhere water;  cats need to be watched so that they do not go after the crows;  the wind blows things away in the room and slam the doors ... Yes, and I'm afraid of heights.  More precisely, not the height itself, but the consequences of falling from it. <br><br>  And here the trunk comes to the rescue.  No, of course, it would be more convenient for an elephant to reach the outermost, dirtiest glass surface - but now I‚Äôm talking about an unusual gadget that helps to wash windows.  He is called " <a href="http://dadget.ru/hobot-188/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dhobot-188%26utm_content%3Dhobot-188%26utm_campaign%3Dhobot-188_96">robot HOBOT</a> ".  Perhaps from ‚Äúhoover robot‚Äù (?) - this is also, in fact, a vacuum cleaner, but only a vertical takeoff, so to speak. <br><br>  This unusual solution for washing glass and mirror (and, in principle, any smooth) surfaces is offered by the company <a href="http://dadget.ru/hobot-188/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dhobot-188%26utm_content%3Dhobot-188%26utm_campaign%3Dhobot-188_96">Dadzhet</a> .  But is Hobot as good as advertised? <br><br><h4>  Let's understand (tm) </h4><br>  The device is a distant relative of the vacuum cleaner.  It draws air through two channels, which serve as supports for it, on which special rings hold microfiber cloths.  Due to the resulting drop in pressure, the Trunk sticks to a vertical, smooth surface and is able to hold and move along it.  It releases air through small openings in the sides of the case. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Naturally, for the work he needs food, so for himself he has to carry the cord.  Included with the trunk is an external power supply (as for laptops) - due to this, the weight of the trunk itself is small, - and an extension cord.  The resulting length of the wire with an extension cord is about 5 meters, which allows you to wash almost any window (we will not consider the whole skyscraper washing option). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f96/93c/fbd/f9693cfbd845416391c9f79a02498d99.jpg"><br>  <i>Contents of delivery</i> <br><br>  Of course, an inquisitive beta tester of gadgets will immediately ask - but what if for a second the power goes out in the apartment?  Trunk stone rush down from the n-tsatogo floor? <br><br>  Here, the forethought of the device comes into force, which periodically appears in different features of the gadget.  For example, from short-term or accidental blackouts, an expensive gadget will save the built-in battery, which will take over the rescue of the Trunk in the event of a power outage.  I tested this feature by simply unplugging the device from the outlet.  And the robot really did not fall - he stopped moving and began to squeak plaintively. <br><br>  Secondly, in order to avoid accidents (after all, if you think a kilogram Trunk, falling from some 16th floor, is theoretically capable of not only breaking itself, but also causing serious damage). The trunk is equipped with a safety cable.  Thin (but strong) rope ends with a carbine, which is recommended to attach to something heavy, durable and immobile before any high-altitude work (the spouse on the couch, battery, other rather heavy objects).  It is only necessary to calculate the free length of the cable so that it does not prevent the robot from moving across the entire window surface. <br><br>  Naturally, in order to clean the glass, a cleaning agent should be applied to the napkins.  I took the tool, which showed itself well when hand-washing, in a bottle with a spray. <br><br>  These daredevils do not read the instructions - but after experimenting, I was convinced that it is better to wet the napkins exactly as the manufacturer recommends.  There will have to adapt and practice a little.  If you wet the napkins too much, the surface will become too slippery for the Trunk - it will slip and will not be able to climb up.  Too dry wipes will not remove all the dirt.  But I quickly understood how to do it. <br><br>  The magic of the robot works like this: we lean it against the glass, turn on the toggle switch (you need to charge the built-in battery before use), and gently release it.  The robot is hanging on the glass due to the pressure difference.  Then we press the desired button on the remote control - and the robot begins to crawl on the glass, bypassing it so as to capture the entire area.  It sucks in air, which is then released at an angle to the side of the glass.  I think this is done on purpose - this is how it blows away the dust and dries the cleaner.  The robot is buzzing quite loudly, practically, like a vacuum cleaner - cats are afraid of it in the same way. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Szad_rwb8xs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiv1C1x6kNX5D-Qvn8I115ocglFpg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>The cat does not trust</i> <br><br>  The robot moves, alternately cycling its two round supports.  Air is drawn in through them, and they can also be turned with the help of motors.  The trunk fixes the position of one support on the glass and turns itself around it, and the other at this time rotates in the opposite direction, thereby rubbing the glass.  Turning at a certain angle, the robot changes the duties of the supports in some places - and makes another small step.  To climb up the window, it turns horizontally. <br><br><h4>  You see the edges of something (s) Fizruk </h4><br>  The edges of the glass trunk feels himself.  It is very convenient - no calibration is needed.  If he crawls on a surface that does not have a frame, and its edges break off ‚Äî for example, on a table, or a cabinet door ‚Äî the built-in sensors tell him when it slightly goes beyond the edge (I suspect that a sharp increase in air flow is being processed).  If this is a pane of glass, then the robot rests against the frame when moving, and the feedback from the motors says that it rested, and there is no further way. <br><br>  The main and recommended work algorithm is ‚Äúup, then down‚Äù.  This means that the Trunk crawls to the top of the glass, and having groped the top, begins methodically bypassing all the glass, first making a horizontal passage in one direction, then, feeling the edge, goes down a little and goes horizontally to the end in the other direction. <br><br>  Gradually, he passes all the glass, and, having groped the bottom edge on the last passage, stops and, with a joyous squeak, reports the completion of the work. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the robot will not be able to jump from the glass.  Therefore, it is necessary either to monitor his work, or not to go far to hear a squeak - or at least periodically visit him. <br><br><h4>  Robots injected </h4><br>  The manual says that the robot can not be used on surfaces without edging.  Therefore, naturally, I immediately did so - I tried it on the mirror door of the cabinet.  In the course of cleaning, the Trunk froze at the edge of the door twice, giving signals that are described in the instructions as ‚Äúnot enough energy‚Äù.  Apparently, he was confused by the suddenly ending surface.  But after pressing the button on the remote that sent him in the right direction, he continued to work.  And, by the way, he cleaned the door perfectly - only small areas remained in the corners, where the round supports of the robot did not reach.  The rest turned out perfectly clean mirror. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yk4sMnRbNaA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLr4m_gPkOlHQGQgVttqr5Uyk48w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>The trunk washes a mirror</i> <br><br>  The next difficult task was a very dirty window.  On the glass with edging the robot was oriented much better and did not hang.  But the instruction advised to walk on very dirty surfaces three times - first with dry napkins (to remove dust), then moistened with detergent (washing), and then - with one moistened napkin, and one almost dry (to clean divorces).  It turned out that if the glass was wiped clean for so long and carefully, it becomes slippery and the robot begins to slide off it - it does not fall, but it does not stand the correct trajectory anymore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c9/7d4/6e4/7c97d46e4f8548df81d0ee3f14c8c82a.jpg"><br>  <i>Dirty window ...</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66e/daf/dba/66edafdba3c34402b86d5a18fb672372.jpg"><br>  <i>And-and-and-and-it is pure!</i> <br><br>  However, there is no sense in the triple pass - it turned out that he had laundered a very dirty window very well twice.  During the first pass it was very funny (and pleasant) to watch how after each step of the Trunk the light from the outside becomes slightly better - the glass was cleaned before our eyes.  The second passage cleaned divorces - unfortunately, not quite perfect, and in the bright sun circular traces are slightly noticeable.  But, in my opinion, this is not critical, and of course, much better than a dirty window. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CNSuTqzutrk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhS64HivNuw6zIUzkvtA3go6fMLxg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>The trunk washes the window</i> <br><br>  When washing windows revealed two flaws.  First: along the edging there remain small, unwashed areas of glass ‚Äî although the robot, having reached the edge, slides down in several movements, it does not capture a small area.  Not washed is not a continuous strip along the edge, but small triangular sections.  Second: the narrow sash, he can not wash in automatic mode.  Vertically, the robot can only move horizontally.  If the width of the sash is narrower than the height of the Trunk (about 30 cm), it will not work. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MV-UmVitn2Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgi2u3WBFRV5v5yboZjm1CMf9f_bw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>The trunk can not narrow sash</i> <br><br>  In case of severe contamination, the window wipes have to be changed after the Trunk has washed the sash on both sides.  Naturally, it is better to start from a less dirty (inner) side.  Here again, the reasonableness of the gadget and the fact that the developers tested it themselves are visible.  First, there are seven pairs of napkins at once - enough for seven very dirty window casements. <br><br>  Secondly, ring fasteners are provided for removing and donning napkins.  The ring is easily removed from the support, then the napkin is removed from the ring and a new one is put on.  There is even a ribbed coating on the outside of the ring to make it easier to put on a round napkin with an elastic band.  And after use napkins are simply washed in the car.  I washed them in synthetic mode along with the rest of the clothes without any problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1b/f75/7f0/e1bf757f07ff4d4f841c37a9a0fb5215.jpg"><br>  <i>Unwashed corner</i> <br><br><h4>  Fun geometry </h4><br>  The third step I tried to wash with the help of the trunk coffee table, made in the form of a triangular shape of constant width.  And, although the table is not rectangular, but the Trunk was able to scrub it, moving along a complex trajectory resembling the trajectory of a bouncing ball in a pinball game.  ‚ÄúBouncing‚Äù off the edges, he cleaned the table well in several passes. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TJkWDolPO00%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjgkdU8nVeo8622kQQdGjkZUsWUnA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Table wash</i> <br><br>  I am not keen on rubbing parquet, but I think that this is the simplest of all the tasks for the Trunk.  From there even fall nowhere. <br><br><h4>  Our service is both dangerous and difficult. </h4><br>  I put off testing the washing of windows outside for last - and in vain.  This procedure has changed my attitude to this device.  Honestly, at first I was skeptical about him - you can wash windows twice a year (and as practice shows - less often), and for this you can create a special gadget ... And I can wipe the table with my hands ... <br><br>  And no.  This was the most pleasant moment of using the Trunk.  Attach a safety cable to something heavy (I tied to a bicycle).  Turn on the robot.  We slightly stick out the hand from the window and stick it outside to the glass.  All - then take the remote and start the show. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AK7XuQ7skiM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgZl4k1VCzMERwInyVArf08I2ACAg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Managing the Trunk with the remote in manual mode</i> <br><br>  Personally, I would be very surprised to see such a thing from the street at someone on the window.  But even if we discard the impression made on passers-by, the Trunk delivers a lot of pleasure.  No need to risk poking out of the window, trying to get to the far edge of the glass, then look inside and examine - am I completely otter? .. <br><br>  The trunk surrounds the glass automatically.  Do not rub off the plot?  Remote send a robot to it and let him crawls there.  Yes, you need to follow him.  But it‚Äôs one thing to spend this time scrubbing the window on your own while being outside at the waist.  Another is to sit quietly in the room, looking at the phone or book. <br><br>  In the end, I washed my windows.  No one was hurt during the experiment, the Trunk never fell, and I did not drop it. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oSqZMd8KIww%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiWsNEGxOvBlqBmQ4CE6_G2vtDd0g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>The most terrible (and cool) moment: washing windows outside</i> <br><br>  For a long time not washed windows (I repent) were forced to change the napkins after each sash.  But now, it seems to me, my windows will be better kept clean ... <br><br><h4>  Frequently asked Questions </h4><br>  <i>which I invented myself (like most of the authors of such headings)</i> <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Is there really a window that scrubs your device, not worse than a specially trained housekeeper from a former union republic? <br><br>  <b>A:</b> Worse.  There are unwashed areas, and here and there divorces - for their 100% elimination you need to wash the windows in at least two passes.  If you are aiming for perfectionism or will take photos of deep space objects through glass, then this device will not work for you.  If you just need to provide a luminous flux into the room, see what the kids are doing on the playground, or if a suspicious man approached your car - then please. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> I am a blonde and I do not understand your these electrical things.  With a vacuum cleaner, I can still cope.  Will your little thing fit me? <br><br>  <b>A: I</b> 'm surprised that you looked at our resource.  Welcome.  Especially for you, I propose the following plan of action: <br><br>  a) take your young man's credit card <br>  b) buy Hobot <br>  c) inform your MCH that you bought a toy for HIM.  After that, he forgets about his robot vacuum cleaner and quadrocopter, and combines business with pleasure. <br><br>  Plus - jokes-minutes like ‚ÄúI washed the table with my trunk yesterday‚Äù and ‚Äúdo you want to get your trunk?‚Äù You are provided. <br>  In general, I think that a blonde after a little training will be able to work with the gadget itself. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  A good device, easy to use and coping with their work.  Does not require cleaning, washing, care, purchase of consumables. <br><br>  Is the Hobot gadget needed in the household just like a washing machine or dishwasher, microwave or vacuum cleaner?  Most likely no.  But if you have it, it won't gather dust in the corner.  In another way to wash the windows you are unlikely to become. <br><br>  <a href="http://dadget.ru/hobot-188/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dhobot-188%26utm_content%3Dhobot-188%26utm_campaign%3Dhobot-188_96">The discount code is 20 days from the date of publication</a> : GEEKT-HOBOT </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366361/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366361/</a></p>
